NO MAN'S LAND; THE TERRITORY OF 'TWO EAGLES' SHOULD BE A TREASURED WILDERNESS

 When I was growing up in the desert of west Texas and southern New Mexico, I 
saw the landscape change with the encroachment of the 1.5 million people from 
El Paso and Juarez. In the 1960s and '70s, you could still escape the polluted 
haze of border industries by hiking into the Organ Mountains near Las Cruces, 
N.M. When I left the area for good in 1978, the Franklin Mountains surrounding 
El Paso were no longer a haven because new housing developments had cut into 
them, destroying the fragile, ecological balance and the beauty of those bare 
mountains; you had to go farther into the southern New Mexico desert to find 
solitude. Years later, I wrote a book of essays about the desert and its rich, 
natural world as I had known it in my childhood. I recounted my experiences 
with great, diamondback rattlers and the hundreds of collar lizards that 
skipped everywhere I walked. I thought I knew everything there was to know 
about the area. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading and gazing at "Two Eagles / Dos Aguilas," my view of where I 
grew up has been completely disrupted and pleasantly changed. Peter Steinhart's 
essays, written in clear, simple language, invite the reader to join him on his 
explorations and discoveries. His knowledge about the Southwest reveals a whole 
new world that is thriving along what Steinhart calls "the most ecologically 
diverse region in North America." Despite the disappearance of much of the 
desert and wildlife around major cities such as El Paso, Steinhart's book is 
encouraging. He shows how the borderlands are very much alive and surviving 
current problems such as pollution, industrial mismanagement, the population 
boom and political tensions between the United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two Eagles" is a tour of the natural world along the border from San Diego to 
the Texas Gulf Coast. Steinhart and photographer Tupper Ansel Blake drew their 
boundaries to include everything 50 miles north of the border and everything 50 
miles south. The region in between is a belt of valuable natural resources, 
ancient rock valleys, pockets of tropical fauna and bird species, alpine 
forests and mighty currents of mountain waters churning into two of our most 
crucial waterways, the Colorado and Rio Grande rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of those rare books in which the imagery of fine writing is 
nourished by the imagery of fine photography. As I read about Steinhart's 
travels, and became hypnotized by Blake's photographs, I realized that I may 
have been guilty of dismissing much of the area I wrote about as a desolate 
wasteland whose life was over. "Two Eagles" is a groundbreaking book because it 
does away with the myth many natives themselves have been guilty of promoting 
about the borderlands. There was always more to the region than I knew about. 
The deserts, mountains, high forests and green valleys of the borderlands are 
beautiful, mysterious and environmentally fragile. The Chihuahua desert of 
southern New Mexico was a world large enough for a small boy, but as its plants 
and wildlife were overrun by new streets, its stripped landscape forced many of 
us to believe there was nothing left. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinhart's experience as a naturalist and environmental writer has drawn out 
secrets of the borderlands and its natural world that few natives, much less 
outsiders, would know about. He documents little-known species of animals 
native to the borderlands: jaguars, ocelots, parrots, bears and wolves. The 
region is abundant with plant life that varies from yuccas, ocotillo and 
lechugilla to lesser-known ebony trees, guayacans, cenizo and anacuas. As 
overview in his first essay, "On the Border," Steinhart writes: "The 
borderlands . . . are that part of the continent where temperate life meets 
tropical life. To the north, where most rains fall, are rolling prairies and 
thick forests. To the south, the land rises into the Mexican plateau; there, 
too, the land is wetter and more forested. Draw a line fifty miles north of and 
parallel to the entire border: the resulting 95,000 square miles contain the 
United States' richest biodiversity, more species per square mile than any 
other part of the nation, with the sole possible exception of southern Florida. 
A similar strip south of the border is one of Mexico's areas of highest 
biodiversity, and Mexico boasts a number of endemic species perhaps higher than 
any other nation's." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinhart is not, however, celebrating the biological richness of the 
borderlands without warning about its environmental degradation. The pivotal 
chapter of "Two Eagles" is "In the Kingdom of Grasses," in which Steinhart 
describes the vast grasslands found along the border. The main grass region 
lies in Southwestern New Mexico, where the best year-round grazing is found. 
Here the 40 different species of native grasses include black grana, blue 
grana, hay grana, boboza and sacaton. Beginning with Coronado's arrival at Zuni 
Pueblo in 1540, Steinhart traces the history of men coming to the borderlands 
and transforming them forever with the introduction of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The reader's realization of the ecological damage and contradictions of 
settling the West clash dramatically with the romantic impression the beautiful 
book initially creates. The borderlands may still be one of the richest natural 
areas of the continent, but men continue to shape the history of its isolated 
landscape. The fine ecological balance is tipping toward complete destruction 
of the borderlands, until there will be nothing left but those new steel fences 
the U.S. Border Patrol is erecting to keep Mexicans out. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinhart's insight on the fragile relationship between men and nature is the 
underlying tragic theme of "Two Eagles." "This distinctive biological 
province," he writes, "would be studied and celebrated as unique and precious, 
like the Everglades or the Great Plains or the redwood forest, but for one 
fact. It is bisected by the U.S.-Mexico border, and though the line is no wider 
than a pencil lead, it casts a shadow so broad as to obscure the nature of this 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Steinhart's contributions is his study of the environment south of 
that shadow. "Two Eagles" effectively erases Northern Mexico's image of a vast, 
moon-like terrain of harsh deserts. One of the lushest of tropical zones, the 
mountains of northern Mexico have been home to large populations of black 
bears, wolves, jaguars and rare species of predatory birds. The last three 
chapters are devoted to ecological problems in Mexico and the efforts of its 
few environmental groups. Their successes have been limited by the political 
climate in Mexico and barriers that make it difficult for U.S. groups to work 
south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 One can only hope that Steinhart's wisdom, compassion and resolve and Blake's 
visual intensity will encourage more people to pay attention to the 
borderlands. In the last essay, which gives the book its title, Steinhart 
concludes by writing: "I looked up and saw a dark shape to the southwest, just 
over the bulk of the Santa Catalina Mountains. It had the broad, board-like 
wings of an eagle. It drifted on an unseen current, and pumped its great wings 
every now and then to stay afloat. I stared hard through the haze, looking for 
the throat or wing tips of a caracara. As my gaze followed it, it seemed to 
flash a burst of light and then to vanish in the sinking sun. When I gained my 
vision and looked again, the bird was gone. Which eagle was it? The eagle of 
the natural setting or the eagle of the flag? The eagle of community and spirit 
or the eagle of militant purpose? Which eagle will fly over the borderlands of 
the future?"

SILENT KILLERS; SEX, DRUGS, WAR AND TRAVEL ARE HELPING TO SPREAD DISEASES 
RAPIDLY WORLDWIDE; THE COMING PLAGUE: NEWLY EMERGING DISEASES IN A WORLD OUT OF 
BALANCE, BY LAURIE GARRETT (FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX: $25; 750 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Fitzhugh Mullan, Fitzhugh Mullan is a pediatrician and public health 
practitioner. His most recent book is Plagues and Politics: the Story of the 
United States Public Health Service. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As medical students in the mid-1960s, we paid little heed to public health. 
Our one public class was a half-credit, half-term sleeper late in the second 
year when all we cared about was starting the third year when we would begin 
"real" doctoring. Neither did we accord much respect to the monumental public 
health achievements of the past, cleaning up the human condition, virtually 
doubling the American life span in the course of the previous century, nor did 
we have any inkling of the vulnerability of those victories. We were focused on 
the curvature care of individuals -- individuals with heart disease, cancer and 
stroke, diseased of aging in a society that, to the extent we even thought 
about it, believed it had conquered infectious disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The students of the 1960s, schooled in a culture that accorded little 
importance to infectious disease and population medicine, are today's leaders 
in a world whose biology and epidemiology are worrisomely different from what 
was expected. Historic killers such as TB and measles are on the rise, cholera 
and plague remain much with us, and new lethal pathogens are erupting 
regularly. These ugly realities are both symbolized and, for practical 
purposes, trumped by the global pandemic of AIDS that, according to some 
estimates, promises to infect 100 million people by the early years of the 21st 
Century, leaving incalculable devastation in its wake. 
</P>
<P>
 This microbiological resurgence in a world grown complacent is the topic of 
Laurie Garrett's "The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in World Out of 
Balance." Her treatise is encyclopedic in detail, missionary in zeal and 
disturbing in its message. By the mid-20th Century, many scientists and policy 
makers assumed that vaccines and antibiotics would soon tame the world of 
infectious disease. This confidence was not limited to the West. In 1963, 
Chairman Mao confidently joined the struggle against "pests," declaring war on 
schistosomiasis in China. 
</P>
<P>
 The Four seas are rising, clouds and waters raging,  
</P>
<P>
 The Five Continents are rocking, wind and thunder roaring.  
</P>
<P>
 Away with all pests!  
</P>
<P>
 Our force is irresistible.  
</P>
<P>
 But Garrett's chronicle of these pests does not play out so simply. While 
"Smallpox Zero" (the global eradication of small pox) was achieved in 1977, 
that triumph stands as mankind's only definitive victory over infectious 
disease. Malaria, once targeted for extinction, remains very much at bay, as 
are polio and measles, diseases for which excellent vaccines exist. More 
disturbing has been the appearance of an array of disease that are either new 
or newly prominent due to changing ecology. Lyme disease is identified as a 
tick-borne infection on the coast of Connecticut and 15 years later has been 
diagnosed in all 50 states. The Marburg virus is established as the cause of a 
deadly hemorrhagic fever killing scientists working with primates in Germany 
and Yugoslavia but its origin is in the jungles of East Africa. Similar viruses 
dubbed Ebola and Lassa cause lethal epidemics in African communities and recede 
again. Legionnaires' disease and Toxic Shock Syndrome are newly virulent 
manifestations of known bacteria, and the Hanta virus that suddenly kills 
people in the rural Southwest is a new genetic variation of an old virus 
carried by an unusually robust population of deer mice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Coming Plague" details varieties of human behavior that, perhaps even 
more than the resilience of microorganisms, have promoted the spread of 
disease. Sex, drugs, war and travel have on their own and together created 
circumstances where venereal and blood-borne diseases have been effectively 
seeded and spread. Increased heterosexual and homosexual promiscuity and 
prostitution have brought syphilis and gonorrhea back from virtual extinction. 
Hepatitis and AIDS have followed the same routes, amplified by needle sharing, 
attacking knowing participants and unknowing spouses and offspring. War and 
civil strife have given us back cholera in Rwanda, created a seedbed for AIDS 
in Uganda and Tanzania, and launched drug-resistant gonorrhea in Vietnam. Air 
travel provides the means to send a microbe anywhere in the world with 
staggering efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it is the globalization and, most particularly, the "thirdworldization" 
of life on much of the planet that is the essence of Garrett's diagnosis. An 
outbreak on one continent is now a potential outbreak on all continents. The 
march of poverty, drugs, war and tribalism has vastly expanded the "petri 
dishes" in which old diseases thrive and new ones erupt. She estimates that 21 
million people were living as refugees or in war zones at the end of 1993. The 
world's exploding population -- 1.5 billion at the end of the last century, 
almost 6 billion today and an estimated 12 billion by the middle of the next 
century -- is, by itself, a driver of poverty and a spectacular amplifier of 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 One has to read carefully and at some length to find signs of hope amid 
Garrett's disturbing annals of bad microbes, venal behavior and dissolute 
politics. Technologies are improving and genetic engineering, in particular, 
now provides magnificent tools to diagnose and trace the origin and spread of 
bacteria and viruses. The worldwide vigilance and competence of the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) get good marks and Garrett's endorsement as 
the lead planetary watchdog, given her definitive dismissal of the World Health 
Organization's capabilities in these arenas. In the end she argues for a brand 
of global communitarianism as the only possible counteroffensive to devastating 
diseases. "Rapid globalization of human niches requires that human beings 
everywhere on the planet go beyond viewing their neighborhoods, provinces, 
countries, or hemispheres as the sum total of their personal ecospheres." 
Population control, environmental preservation and human development are 
absolute requirements if we are to have a chance against the certain arrival of 
new plagues. Laurie Garrett's warning echoes John Donne's 400-year-old wisdom, 
"No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, 
a part of the main." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Coming Plague" makes fascinating if troubling reading. It is an important 
contribution to our awareness of human ecology and the fragility of the 
relative biological well-being that many of us enjoy. Garrett is a journalist, 
formerly a science correspondent for National Public Radio and now a science 
writer for New York Newsday. She has mastered an extraordinary amount of detail 
about the pathology, epidemiology and human events surrounding dozens of 
complex diseases. She writes engagingly, carrying her themes as well as the 
reader's interest from outbreak to outbreak. At times, though, her details get 
sloppy. Measles does not produce "a roseola rash"; roseola infantum is a 
disease of its own. Reagan's first HHS Secretary was Sen. -- not Dr. -- Richard 
Scweiker. Such small flaws raise unsettling questions in the mind of the reader 
about which of the thousands of other facts that punctuate her text might be 
inaccurate. Garrett's editors failed to reign in the length and unnecessary 
detail of the text and to help her maintain a consistent writing style. At 
times the book reads like a doctoral thesis with more than 100 pages of end 
notes (but no index) while at others it sounds more like a classic comic -- 
"Don Francis was burned out before he even got to Harvard." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Coming Plague," though, is the kind of book that might have grabbed the 
attention of those drowsy, self-absorbed medical students in that public health 
class and taught them a thing or two about the world. It is certainly likely to 
capture the attention of readers today and raise their level of knowledge and 
concern about the condition of the human world and its microbial fellow 
travelers. Or do I have that backward? It will, perhaps, educate us about the 
world of microbes . . . and their human fellow travelers.

RICHARD EDER: TIME NEVER STOPS; REBELLION AT A DANISH BOARDING SCHOOL SHOWS HOW 
PROGRESS OFTEN COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF HUMANITY; BORDERLINERS, BY PETER HOEG 
(FARRAR STRAUS & GIROUX: $22; 277 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ostensibly, the villain of Peter Hoeg's novel about the rebellion of three 
tormented children at a progressive Danish boarding school is the tyrannically 
self-righteous headmaster. "Borderliners," though, is more a philosophic 
allegory than a story; and its real villain is linear time -- time, that is, as 
an inflexible progress that the powerful misuse to constrain the circular 
talents and zigzag impulses of human nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoeg's second book to be translated into English makes an austere contrast to 
his "Smilla's Sense of Snow," a novel of suspense about a turbulent Greenland 
woman who investigates the death of a child and comes up against a vast 
political-economic-scientific conspiracy. "Smilla" offered a churning narrative 
excitement, and a vivid and affecting protagonist. In the dryer "Borderliners," 
the characters are drawn finely but much more abstractly. At bottom, both are 
novels of moral and social argument but in "Borderliners" the bottom eddies 
right up to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoeg's pervasive theme in both books is the abuse of children by the means 
that civilization -- especially, perhaps, an enlightened Scandinavian 
civilization -- has used to advance itself. More generally, his children stand 
for humanity's instinctive and unspoiled possibilities; by making them the 
victims, Hoeg is able to distill the passionate rage that gives energy to his 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 What gives distinctiveness to the rage is the supercooled bleakness with which 
it is conveyed; the unmodulated grays, the darkness without a penumbra, the 
light without warmth and the distances that separate the characters even when 
they are embracing -- or brutalizing -- each other. Peter, the 14-year-old 
narrator-protagonist, and the 16-year-old Katarina share a bench and a kiss in 
the school shed they've managed to escape to; it is a blinding consummation, 
but more celestial than material. Biehl, the headmaster, shamefully slaps 
students who break the rules of his Utopian establishment; the pain is not in 
the blow but in the seconds preceding and following it. It is in the abasement. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl's school is set up, in cooperation with the state authorities, as a 
model educational experiment, "a workshop of the sun," as he lyrically puts it. 
With 26 teachers and 200 students, the pedagogical attention is overwhelming; 
big brothers and sisters continually watch everyone. It is entirely dedicated 
to the notion of progress; specifically, measurable scientific progress. It is 
a temple to linear time -- year by year not only do the students learn more but 
they are also advanced to higher floors in the school building -- and it is 
ruled by the bell that signals where everyone is to be, and when. 
</P>
<P>
 Laboratory conditions, isolation from the sloppiness of the outside world, and 
a sterile totalitarianism. Discipline is by restrictions and verbal suasion, in 
principle, but Biehl has not been able to exclude the germs of human weakness; 
not even his own. He slaps occasionally, once in a while he hits, and once or 
twice he has beaten. He keeps a coded record, a secret confessional. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the rigor is justified by a utopian aim: the eventual integration of 
all students, from the gifted and cooperative to those who have been placed in 
centers for the disturbed and the delinquent. As a preliminary experiment, 
three such children are introduced; and they are the three who serve as the 
novel's protagonists and the vehicles of Hoeg's passionate anti-utopian thesis. 
Peter is an orphan who has shuttled between reform schools of greater and 
lesser rigor. Katarina comes from a more privileged class, but her mother has 
died of cancer and her father, unable to cope, has hanged himself. And finally, 
an extreme case has been admitted: August, a violently abused child who has 
killed both his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter tries to conform; to be expelled would be to perish. Katarina questions, 
and her questioning soon enlists him in a compact to explore and try to 
understand the system that oppresses them. To test out the constraints, 
Katarina makes herself deliberately unpunctual. Peter steals school records. 
Their hesitant experiments take on urgency when August is put under Peter's 
care. The child's violence -- at one point he breaks Peter's finger -- and his 
agony -- he sneaks out to the chemistry lab at night to inhale gas so he can 
sleep -- are one single denunciation. Peter and Katarina would escape, but they 
cannot abandon August: their burning resolve, forged against the institution's 
chilly experiments, is that a child must never be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 They rebel, instead, in an act of sabotage that involves a complex disruption 
of the inviolate schedule -- at one point Peter switches the mechanism that 
regulates the bells -- and that ends in tragic disaster. Peter will survive; 
August won't; Katarina's fate is uncertain. Eventually Peter will get himself 
adopted by a nurturing family, will grow up, get married and have a child. 
Human love saves him where social and scientific notions of progress have all 
but destroyed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Borderliners" moves back and forth between a part-magical story of childhood 
rebellion -- there are suggestions of such classics as Alain-Fournier's "The 
Wanderer" and Cocteau's "Les Enfants Terribles" -- and a wide-ranging series of 
speculations by Peter, now an adult and speaking retrospectively. The former is 
suggestive but often schematic. Neither Peter nor Katarina is particularly 
distinct as a character -- August, the child psychotic, is much more affecting 
-- and Biehl and the teachers are little more than sketches of different kinds 
of baleful authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The speculative asides are awkwardly integrated. They parallel the story and 
certainly explicate it, but they rarely manage to haunt or enhance it. They 
have their own strength, however. Though some passages drag on wordily and 
though Hoeg has a tendency to hammer repetitively at points he has already 
made, his ideas are, in fact, at the heart of the book, and some have an 
alluring edge. 
</P>
<P>
 There is his discussion of linear versus circular time, for example. If the 
former is essential to a great part of our practical and intellectual life, he 
quarrels with what he considers its abuse. He associates such abuse with 
mathematical and scientific notions of progress; what he objects to is their 
spread to other fields; notably those of social science and education. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the argument is dry; nor does it, in itself, have notable 
originality. Sometimes, though, an image will transfigure it. Take spider webs. 
Rarely, Hoeg writes, are they more than two feet across. A spider could not 
handle more information than a two-foot web brings in. It would destroy its 
nature. Too much information, too much perfecting, can destroy human nature as 
well, he argues. Again, it is not the argument that particularly stands up. But 
Hoeg on spider webs and the dew that hangs on them between two trees on an 
early morning manages to enhance the notion of limits, and how necessary they 
are to humanity, in ways beyond argument. He does for spider webs and us what 
he uncannily did for snow and us in "Smilla."

RESURRECTING IRAN-CONTRA; ONE-TIME NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER AND CHIEF SCANDAL 
SCAPEGOAT GIVES HIS FIRST-PERSON ACCOUNT; SPECIAL TRUST, BY ROBERT C. MCFARLANE 
AND ZOFIA SMARDZ (CADELL & DAVIES: $25; 389 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In August, 1993, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh issued his final report on 
the Iran-Contra scandal. His ultimate findings made the front page of many 
newspapers, but by no means all, for journalists and citizens alike were weary 
of the story after seven years of partisan finger-pointing, fragmentary 
reporting, internecine recrimination and never-ending attempts at spin control. 
The Walsh report, in theory, should have put Iran-Contra to rest, allowing the 
participants in the scandal -- and the public at large -- to get on with their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 That hasn't happened, of course, and in retrospect it's unreasonable to think 
that any formal document could do justice, in every sense of the term, to 
Iran-Contra. 
</P>
<P>
 In skeletal summary, the story seems the first draft of a B-movie: U.S. 
government officials secretly sell state-of-the-art military arms to shady 
figures in one country in order to procure the release of political hostages in 
another, with the proceeds sent, again in secret and against U.S. law, to 
guerrilla fighters in a third country. 
</P>
<P>
 Add figures such as Ronald Reagan, Oliver North, John Poindexter, Elliot 
Abrams and Caspar Weinberger (not to mention Fawn Hall), and you have the 
makings of a Shakespearean tragedy. Reagan as Caesar in dotage, given to 
demagoguery but easily swayed by sentiment; a band of advisers displaying 
various degrees of loyalty -- George Shultz a dutiful Kent, Weinberger a 
frustrated Coriolanus, Alexander Haig an un-shrewd Cassius; North a truly 
Shakespearean figure, combining Anthony's public oratorical skills with Iago's 
private cunning. Who but Shakespeare could capture the moral contradictions, 
the misguided patriotism, the inevitable personal treachery, that the 
Iran-Contra scandal would force these and other characters to face . . . or in 
some cases, ignore? 
</P>
<P>
 There's one figure even Shakespeare might have trouble with, however: Robert 
(Bud) McFarlane, decorated Marine, one-time national security adviser, chief 
Iran-Contra scapegoat, famously failed suicide, and now author of "Special 
Trust," the latest, and surely one of the last, first-person accounts of the 
scandal. McFarlane wants to be the principled Brutus, the good soldier who says 
(well before agreeing to Caesar's assassination) that he loves "the name of 
honor more than I fear death." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways McFarlane deserves the comparison, being a straight-shooter who 
fell on his sword in 1987 -- actually, took an overdose of Valium -- as penance 
for setting Iran-Contra in motion. By the time one finishes this memoir, 
though, McFarlane seems more like Gloucester in "King Lear," the attempted 
suicide whose loyalty earns him virtually nothing. Like Gloucester, too, 
McFarlane is blind, at least metaphorically; he never saw betrayal coming, 
failing to understand -- then -- that the Marine's motto of semper fidelis is 
an almost meaningless concept in the political arena, even when voiced by a 
fellow corpsman.

 Oliver North, who stands a good chance of being elected Tuesday to the U.S. 
Senate from Virginia, has called "Special Trust" "a pitiful and mean-spirited 
attempt (by McFarlane) to glue his broken reputation back together again." 
Leave out pitiful and mean-spirited, and in fact that's not a bad description; 
McFarlane's book, like every other political memoir, is self-serving, taking as 
its starting point the idea that negotiating with Iranian dissidents during the 
Khomeini regime was at first a reasonable diplomatic strategy that subsequently 
took on a life of its own, with terrible consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, though, "Special Trust" is a responsible and plausible volume, 
for McFarlane is less interested in generating sympathy and wreaking vengeance 
than in putting Iran-Contra in context. He eventually levels some very serious 
charges -- near the book's close he characterizes North as "deceitful, 
mendacious, and traitorous" -- but by then McFarlane has earned the right to 
call names. It's hard to believe at times that McFarlane was really so trusting 
of his political and intelligence peers as he professes, but by the same token 
it's easy to see, given McFarlane's personal history, why he would presume that 
such trust was fundamental and beyond question. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlane's passage into the corridors of power was straightforward. He grew 
up largely in Washington, the son of a New Deal Democrat who became a prominent 
lawyer in the Justice Department after losing his congressional seat in Texas. 
Bud McFarlane was a Boy Scout who would later marry his highschool sweetheart. 
When in the late 1950s he considered dropping out of the Naval Academy -- from 
which a number of his relatives had graduated -- it was with the idea of 
becoming a pastor. McFarlane's father persuaded him otherwise, however, and 
after obtaining a commission the son served two tours of duty in Vietnam. 
There, like so many other soldiers, he got a troubling dose of political and 
military reality, but that experience was balanced by a much more favorable 
two-year stint studying international relations in Geneva. In 1971 McFarlane 
became a White House Fellow, working in an office next to that of Henry 
Kissinger, then Richard Nixon's national security adviser; two years later he 
was on Kissinger's staff. From that point onward McFarlane's ascent, it seems, 
was assured, for he was good at organizing information and planning for 
contingencies -- here his Marine training shows -- if not at generating 
original ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlane says more than once that his father pressed on his children the idea 
of public service, and the son uses that counsel to frame "Special Trust." The 
title is taken from the charge given to government officials when they accept 
their positions: that they have been invested not merely with power but also 
with a "special trust," each provided by the people in order to help officials 
advance the general good. This is, obviously, a politically astute way to 
introduce McFarlane's story, but it also seems genuine, for McFarlane, unlike 
many of his colleagues, can't be accused of using public service as a 
steppingstone to private riches. He can be accused of high ambition -- of 
trying to give the Reagan Administration the sort of foreign-policy credibility 
that Kissinger had given Nixon -- but that's hardly a criticism, especially 
given the well-known personal and policy disagreements between George Shultz at 
State and Caspar Weinberger at Defense. 
</P>
<P>
 It is fair to say, though, that McFarlane's desire to be a highly successful 
diplomat, perhaps as venerated as Kissinger, played a role, however minor, in 
the events that led to his downfall. An Israeli official, responding to 
diplomatic feelers, reported in 1985 that his government was in contact with 
moderates in Iran who might be able to overthrow the Khomeini government and 
also, so they said, deliver the U.S. hostages held by the Hezbollah terrorist 
group in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlane, national security adviser at the time, was intrigued by the 
information, knowing how much Reagan wanted the hostages brought home safely. 
He soon received the presidential go-ahead to pursue negotiations. Eventually, 
through Israeli intermediaries, the Iranian dissidents insisted that the 
hostages would be released only in exchange for 100 TOW missiles, at which 
point negotiations came to a halt. CIA Director William Casey alone among the 
handful of White House officials consulted on the issue was willing to argue 
for its legality. But when the Israelis suggested a shell game -- that they 
ship the weapons to Iran and later replace the missiles with a duplicate 
purchase from the U.S. -- the plan was revived. Reagan agreed to it, Shultz and 
Weinberger remained opposed, and a few months later, after McFarlane had 
resigned his White House post and become a special envoy to the President, he 
was in Tehran on the verge of destroying his career. 
</P>
<P>
 This is McFarlane's version of the arms-for-hostages agreement, and it 
generally coincides with established facts, except for Reagan's subsequent 
denials that he knew anything about the plan. McFarlane admits that he at least 
advanced the deal, if he didn't precisely father it, and blames Shultz and 
Weinberger mainly for disavowing any knowledge of the arrangement (knowledge 
later confirmed through the disclosure of their contemporaneous notes on the 
affair). The Contra side of the deal hardly comes up at all: McFarlane says he 
learned of it only on the Tehran airport Tarmac, when the Iranians had again 
failed to deliver the hostages, despite having already received missile 
shipments -- directly from the U.S., as it turned out -- after McFarlane had 
resigned his White House position. It was on leaving Iran empty-handed, 
McFarlane says, that North, who was nominally working for McFarlane, told him, 
"Don't worry, Bud, it's not a total loss. At least we're using some of the 
Ayatollah's money in Central America." 
</P>
<P>
 North, of course, says McFarlane not only knew and approved of the 
Contra-bound money but masterminded the entire scheme, giving his assistant 
general authority over covert operations in Nicaragua and, later, ordering a 
cover-up. Both North and McFarlane have been convicted of crimes related to 
Iran-Contra -- McFarlane pleaded guilty to four counts of unlawfully 
withholding material information from Congress, while North was convicted of 
destroying official documents and obstructing Congress -- but there's no 
question which figure has greater credibility. McFarlane's references to 
"special trust" might seem like plays to the peanut gallery except for the fact 
that he alone freely tried to explain Iran-Contra to Congress and the public, 
refusing to plead the Fifth Amendment (as did Oliver North and John Poindexter) 
or insist on immunity from prosecution (which North did, and which led to his 
conviction's being overturned). Yes, McFarlane was naive to believe that "being 
accountable, telling the truth and expecting the system to respect that 
approach would lead to justice being done" . . . but he did the right thing 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlane, now head of an international energy-development company, does not 
come out of "Special Trust" smelling like a rose. The book, first of all, is 
peculiarly well-shaped; one can't help feeling that McFarlane's friend and 
lawyer, Washington lawyer Leonard Garment, made sure his client's public 
account of Iran-Contra jibed well with the existing, uncontradicted record. 
McFarlane, moreover, is proficient at interpreting events in conveniently 
agreeable ways; he ridicules the 1967 decision to build a high-tech electronic 
fence across Vietnam's DMZ to help monitor enemy movements, but 80 pages later 
boasts of creating the "Star Wars" (Strategic Defense Initiative) anti-missile 
system, which would have been an immense high-tech disaster. The SDI discussion 
also shows McFarlane's occasional slipperiness; at first he tries to defend SDI 
on strategic grounds, despite the fact that it upset many U.S. allies, would 
have militarized space, and very likely reignited the arms race, but eventually 
justifies it as simply a diplomatic bargaining chip. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest surprise in "Special Trust" is the fact that McFarlane says 
relatively little about Oliver North. The second biggest is that the book has 
been produced by a new and unknown publisher, Cadell & Davies. McFarlane 
charges in the acknowledgments to this volume that the major publisher with 
whom he orginally signed turned out to be interested only in "sensationalism." 
These facts -- and there's no reason to doubt McFarlane's description of how 
"Special Trust" came to be -- are not unrelated, for McFarlane can no more 
adapt his views and methods to satisfy a commercial publisher's view of a 
"good" Iran-Contra book than he can place Oliver North center stage for the 
dramatic effect the public seems to require. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlane's portrait of Iran-Contra defies the one we carry in our heads -- of 
McFarlane, Shultz, Weinberger, and Poindexter overshadowed by the towering 
figures of Reagan and North (the latter two dressed, of course, as 
gunslingers). In the end, however, the discrepancy makes his memoir more 
trustworthy rather than less. It's ironic that McFarlane was pressured to make 
this book more "marketable," for his refusal to hard-sell himself to Congress, 
the media, and the public -- as did, routinely, those masterful, telegenic 
salesmen, Ronald Reagan and Oliver North -- was the chief reason he became 
Iran-Contra's fall guy. 
</P>
<P>
 In McFarlane's tableau, North "violated the special trust" placed in him by 
the American people, and one can't help but conclude that McFarlane harbors 
similar thoughts about big-time book publishing. Sad but true, and frightening 
to boot; it now seems more important in our culture to be able to project an 
image of integrity and fidelity than actually to possess those qualities, that 
we measure someone's credibility, not against the evidence, but by the ability 
to convince.

THE MAN WHO BEFRIENDED THE LITTLE PRINCE; SAINT-EXUPERY: A BIOGRAPHY, BY STACY 
SCHIFF (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $30; 544 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Langewiesche, William Langewiesche is a pilot and contributing 
editor to the Atlantic Monthly. His book on the U.S.-Mexico border, Cutting for 
Sign, was published by Pantheon earlier this year. He is currently writing a 
book on the Sahara.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In France you must never directly ask another person's profession, but must 
pretend instead that work is a veneer, beneath which lies the uncompromised 
soul. If this seems like a wishful conceit, nonetheless it fits nicely into a 
society that elevates the young intellect, then traps it in a lifetime of 
hierarchies. The entrapment has effects more corrosive than those of bad 
education. Unemployment statistics can only hint at the problem: Beyond the 
glory of its civilization, beyond the achievements of its elites, everyday 
France suffers a secret denial of life. Now there is talk of a four-day 
workweek. The problem lies not with idleness but with work that can so easily 
be left behind. By necessity more than choice, the French have become a people 
abandoned to vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the heroic French pilot and writer, was all the 
opposite -- a man abandoned to vocation. He was neither a man of our times, nor 
sadly, of his own. Stacy Schiff makes this clear in her thoughtful and 
compelling account of his life. Saint-Exupery was born to impoverished 
aristocrats in 1900, and he died 44 years later while flying hopeless missions 
against the Germans over occupied France. Best known as the author of "The 
Little Prince," he wrote other successful books, notably "Night Flight" and, in 
nonfiction, "The Wind, the Sand and the Stars." As Schiff sketches him, he was 
a brilliant bear of a man, moody, enthusiastic, childlike, as contradictory as 
he was uncontrolled. When he conjured up youth, he did not dwell on formal 
schooling but remembered instead the days of imagination and discovery. When he 
considered manhood, he did not dwell on Parisian pastimes but reveled in the 
brutal, faraway work of the early airmail pilot. These apparently exclusive 
strains twisted uneasily through his life and writings. Saint-Exupery refused 
to submit to classification. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly as a result, his political thinking has been called naive. His 
overwrought musings, his respect for strong leadership, his glorification of 
"mission," have opened him to accusations of early fascism. It's true that the 
Nazis embraced his books before later banning them. But the man Schiff 
describes was no ideologue. He was a disfranchised nobleman, a humanitarian, a 
wanderer dreaming impractically of a home. If he seemed gullible, it was 
because in the cockpit and on the page he so powerfully sought purpose. Even 
when he appeared to advocate self-sacrifice, he was in fact promoting something 
more personal, work for work's sake, as the definition of his own existence. It 
is entirely appropriate that many of his sales, as Schiff admits, are now to 
vocational schools. In "Night Flight," Saint-Exupery wrote about an old 
mechanic named Leroux, who "had forty years of work behind him. All his 
energies were for his work. When at ten o'clock or midnight Leroux went home it 
certainly was not to find a change of scene, escape into another world." I 
don't know how that sounded in 1931, but for the French of today, Saint-Exupery 
must be a hard read. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not an easy read for today's Americans either. Schiff writes about the 
artistry of French expression, the Anglo-Saxon preference for precision, and 
the difficulties of translation. "What sounds lush in French -- from 
Chateaubriand to Proust -- will in a poor translation turn purple in English." 
She believes Saint-Exupery was lucky to have been well served by his 
translators. Indeed the translations have enjoyed great success in the United 
States. But that begs the point: Even in French, his prose can seem too florid 
for modern American tastes. Never mind. He is worth reading anyway, if for no 
other reason than his humanity. He is also worth reading about. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy Schiff must agree. This is her first book. She was born after 
Saint-Exupery's death, but writes about him with the fondness and nuance of a 
longtime lover. And in love she is wise. She keeps her language clear, and 
neither apologizes for Saint-Exupery's weaknesses nor joins loudly into 
arguments for his cause. Instead, she expresses her dedication through the 
uncompromising quality of her own work. The result is a biography like a call 
from the past. 
</P>
<P>
 She starts the story during Saint-Exupery's years as an airmail pilot on the 
pioneering route from France to Dakar. In 1927 he was posted to the desolate 
Spanish fort and airfield at Cape Juby, 600 miles south of Casablanca, on the 
Sahara's wild Atlantic coast. It was there, under difficult conditions, that 
young Saint-Exupery won the respect of the more seasoned pilots for his courage 
and austerity. He spent time among Moors, some of whom, then as now, were more 
inclined to murder Europeans than to submit to them. Saint-Exupery believed in 
European superiority. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other writers about the Sahara, he did not romanticize the natives. But 
he was willing to listen to them. About a man named el Mammun, who massacred 
the French officers traveling in his caravan, Saint-Exupery later wrote lines 
that still stand as the most concise description of Islamic revolt: "He grew 
old. Growing old, one begins to ponder. Pondering thus, el Mammun discovered 
one night that he had betrayed the God of Islam and had sullied his hand by 
sealing in the hand of the Christians a pact in which he had been stripped of 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The pact that Saint-Exupery signed was with publishers. His first novel, 
"Southern Mail," came out in 1929, and was enthusiastically received. 
Saint-Exupery paid a heavy price: His arrival as a writer marked the start of 
an early decline as a pilot. In the small world of French aviation, he had 
already developed a reputation for vagueness, which now seemed confirmed. 
Pilots are pragmatists, suspicious of abstraction. They are technicians, 
uncomfortable with expression. Saint-Exupery was giving away secrets they did 
not know they had. They began to exclude him from their fraternity -- as most 
still do. 
</P>
<P>
 And they were not wrong. Saint-Exupery was excluding himself. He had begun to 
dream beyond the cockpit, often while flying. He had foolish accidents. 
Nonetheless, he was sent off to organize an airmail route in Argentina, where 
he stayed for two years. He met his wife there, a wild Salvadoran who for the 
rest of his life caused him no end of pain. He continued to write. Upon his 
return he carried with him the manuscript of "Night Flight." The novel was 
published in October, 1931, and was a hit. Within six months his old friends 
would hardly talk to him, and he had been frozen out of the flying profession. 
Soon afterward the airmail company folded. 
</P>
<P>
 Saint-Exupery spent the rest of his years trying to return to the simplicity 
of a pilot's life and failing brilliantly. He had indeed become a pilot to be 
distrusted. Late in 1935 he attempted with a mechanic to make a record flight 
from Paris to Saigon, and crashed into the Libyan desert. The accident was due 
to navigational negligence, the worst sort of piloting stupidity. Not by 
chance, it led to his strongest work as a writer -- the chapter in "The Wind, 
the Sand and the Stars" describing the sensations of thirst in the desert, and 
the thoughts of dying men. "I was perfectly ready to fall asleep, whether for a 
night or for eternity. If I did fall asleep, I could not even know whether it 
was for the one or for the other. And the peace of sleep! But that cry that 
would be sent up at home, that great wail of desolation -- that was what I 
could not bear." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff reports another pilot's belief that Saint-Exupery lived only in order 
to have something to say. The same accusation could be leveled against most 
writers -- it is a view from the outside, but not entirely unfair. Still, the 
accident that followed was so shameful that Saint-Exupery never mentioned it in 
print; in 1938 during a publicity flight through the Americas, Saint-Exupery 
crashed on takeoff from Guatemala City. His error was one no student pilot 
would make: He had forgotten to check the airplane's loading. He and his 
faithful mechanic were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 World War II saved him for a while. He begged his way into a reconnaissance 
squadron at the outset but after the occupation of France, found himself 
grounded in New York for several years. He wrote two books there, including his 
famous lament for life and childhood, "The Little Prince." His sadness was not 
new. Schiff writes, "What Baudelaire described as genius -- childhood recovered 
at will -- could prove as much a curse as a blessing. For Saint-Exupery it 
proved a constant occasion for regret. It was telling that he thought of 
adulthood as an exile, by far a more painful one than the long desolate months 
at Cape Juby. . . . A happy childhood, too, takes its hostages." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Allied invasion of North Africa, Saint-Exupery returned to the fray 
and, despite his reputation, managed to talk his way back into the cockpit. He 
was assigned to his old reconnaissance squadron, now flying unarmed P-38s. The 
other pilots tried to protect him from himself, finding excuses to keep him 
from combat. But he insisted on flying, and during his seventh mission, on July 
31, 1944, he disappeared without a trace. It was not an act of suicide but of 
submission. The French, too, become what they do. Saint-Exupery must have known 
he was no longer a pilot. As a writer he finally abstracted life.

COVER STORY: SHIFTING LOYALTIES; WITH DAVID CARUSO'S DETECTIVE KELLY GONE, WHAT 
IS JIMMY SMITS' STRATEGY UNDER ALL THE SCRUTINY? SLIP INTO ORDERED CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget those forecasts of stormy weather. Producers of ABC's "NYPD Blue" 
predict blue skies and a calm transition from David Caruso to Jimmy Smits. And, 
they believe, fans will still be with the force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our philosophy to this show is, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it," says Emmy 
winner Dennis Franz, who plays outspoken yet dedicated Detective Andy Sipowicz, 
partner of Caruso's recently departed character, John Kelly. And 
soon-to-be-partner of Jimmy Smits, who will play Detective Bobby Simone. (The 
series will be preempted Tuesday by Election Day coverage). 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, change is not a bad thing," says Franz. "In fact, it's turning 
out to be a real positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Smits how he feels about stepping in as Caruso leaves for what he hopes 
will be a feature film career and query Smits on whether viewers will accept 
him as a partner, and he'll diplomatically beg off. His focus, he says, has 
been on getting into character and trying to mesh into the chaotic but smooth 
routine of the cast and the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm know there's going to be a lot of scrutiny, but I'm trying not to think 
about it," says Smits, who is best known for his role as Victor Sifuentes on 
NBC's "L.A. Law," which he played from 1986 to 1991. Smits won a best 
supporting actor Emmy for the role in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people really give me a chance to just slip in there," says Smits. "I 
know the show has loyal fans, and that's not going to happen overnight. It's 
going to take a while. I just hope people are patient. In the best possible 
world, the work will speak for itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Bochco, the show's creator along with David Milch, says: "Obviously the 
show will have different actors and different characters. To the extent that 
they are different, the show will be different. The sound of the show will be 
different, but 'NYPD Blue' will remain 'NYPD Blue' in every sense of the word." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the difference between Caruso and Smits, Bochco quips: 
"Height." But he still declines to go into details about Caruso's abrupt 
departure. The redheaded actor jumping off his hit ship to pursue a movie 
career has many television insiders wondering whether he will go down the path 
of other TV actors who flopped when they followed the lure of the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just as soon not remark on that at all at this stage of the game," 
says Bochco. "It's absolutely inappropriate. It's done. All my focus and energy 
is devoted to the show, and putting Jimmy in the show. As the old saying goes, 
'You can't un-ring a bell.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Smits is even more emphatic about talking about the circumstances that led him 
to "NYPD Blue." "I'm not going to talk about how it all went down, and that's 
the way it's going to stay," he says, softly but firmly. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some suggestions that a strange irony exists in Smits 
replacing Caruso. Some said Smits left "L.A. Law" to find greener celluloid 
pastures, and is returning to television because "Old Gringo," "Switch" and 
other of his films failed to give him marquee value. 
</P>
<P>
 Smits bristles at the comparison and the suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that talk about me leaving 'Law' to become a movie star -- none of that 
came out of my mouth," he says, the edge in his voice coming through loud and 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard that a lot. But I left 'Law' because my five-year contract was up, 
and I felt that everything that I had had to say about that character had been 
said. I wanted to do diferent things. But I never said anything to any 
interviewer about wanting to be a movie star. I did not leave with a 
three-picture deal at Columbia. There are a lot of people who are snobbish 
about where you fit into this business. I'm not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little pissed about things that are being said. I don't feel I'm coming 
back to television because it didn't happen for me. Au contraire. I did feature 
films, I did theater, I did TV movies. It just happened a different way. Good 
work is good work." 
</P>
<P>
 Smits alludes to the entertainment industry's continuing resistance toward 
Latino actors: "You have to be realistic about the way this business is. 
Certain things are, and certain things aren't." He said he is particularly 
happy that the race of his character on "NYPD Blue" is non-specific. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Bochco: "There are a lot of reasons for that. We didn't want to create in 
any way any similarity between Simone and Sifuentes. That was a very conscious 
decision. To have a character whose ethnicity is vague gives us more 
opportunity for fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The stars and producers have been relatively tight-lipped about other aspects 
of Smits' detective, saying they want the audience to have the pleasure of 
discovery themselves. But this much is known: He will be teamed with Sipowicz, 
who is not too happy with the arrangement and the loss of his beloved partner. 
Simone's previous job was in the police commissioner's office. According to 
Smits, he will "be gritty and have an edge." 
</P>
<P>
 But the big question that some fans of Smits and the show want to know is: 
Will Smits bare his body and soul on the show, as Caruso often did in steamy 
love scenes? 
</P>
<P>
 Smits gives the safest answer: "I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a couple of relationship things that are happening that will 
probably come to fruition or that need to be addressed," he says. "But I feel 
about that the same way I felt about 'L.A. Law.' It was important for me to 
establish Sifuentes first as a real good lawyer. The majority of the things I 
did in those first few years were courtroom-oriented. I was really happy with 
that. It's important for me in this situation to establish myself as a good 
cop. And so far, I'm not at the Stairmaster doing special butt exercises." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as fitting into the established ensemble of the show -- which garnered 
a record-setting 26 Emmy nominations its first season, losing best drama to 
"Picket Fences" -- Smits says he could not be happier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a great time," he says enthusiastically. "It's like jumping on an 
express train. The crew is great, they've welcomed me with open arms. They're 
making the transition good for me. It's not awkward. It's all about team 
playing. And Dennis is just incredible. You're not going to meet a more 
generous guy. He's made it so easy for me to walk on the set." 
</P>
<P>
 Franz is equally enthusiastic about his praise for Smits. "Working with Jimmy 
is truly a delight. He's an extremely conscientious worker, and he happens to 
be a gentleman. It's the best of all possible worlds. We have someone who wants 
to step into David's shoes. If that's not where his wishes were, if that isn't 
where his heart was, he should not be made to stay here." 
</P>
<P>
 Franz describes the strain felt by everyone on the "Blue" set the first day 
they arrived back to face Caruso, who had announced his plans to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first half-hour of the first day that we all came back, it was pretty 
awkward," says Franz. "We had all gone in several different directions for 
hiatus. People didn't stay in touch, so we were reunited on the set. All that 
controversy was out in the open. I personally had had no conversation with 
David, and very few had spoken with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then after an hour, it was business as usual," Franz says. "Back to work. 
Whether we had 22 episodes or one, we still had a job to do. Everybody handled 
themselves very professionally." 
</P>
<P>
 And when the farewells came, it was swift, Franz adds. "We were starting 
another episode, we had more work. When David finished his involvement with the 
episode, he had things he needed to do. We all said our goodbys, and then we 
went back on stage and continued working." 
</P>
<P>
 Franz says that despite the ups and downs, he is not concerned about how well 
"NYPD Blue" will fare with fans or critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the success of the show really gives us something to live up to," he 
says. "We have the responsibility to maintain the same level of excitement that 
we always have. But everyone is prepared for that battle." 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on ABC (preempted this week).

THE CANDIDATES' HIRED GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As though we needed another reason to wash our individual and collective hands 
of politics, now there's Clinton Reilly ("The Tortured Soul of a Hired Gun," by 
Amy Wallace, Oct. 2). That someone of his clearly psychopathic character should 
be the state's most notorious and sought-after "high-priced call girl" is the 
final straw. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the countless people who walked out of the Kathleen Brown gubernatorial 
campaign when Reilly walked in, I have no interest in participating in any 
process in which millions of dollars go to keeping him in expensive suits, 
designer neckties and freshly cut roses. 
</P>
<P>
 The final crushing irony is that he gets paid to help his candidates "energize 
the electorate -- 'to turn it on,' says Reilly, 'so it votes.' " Well, we, the 
electorate, don't vote because politics is dominated by killer whores like him 
and his clients. Now that I've expressed my opinion, I sure hope he won't 
"punch a wall repeatedly next to my head."

 I had trouble believing what I was reading. Who would believe that there 
really is a creature such as Clinton Reilly? Who would believe that he can be 
so powerful and successful in getting a candidate elected? And who would think 
that candidates are so power-crazed that they would consort with and pay 
astronomical sums to his ilk in order to win? 
</P>
<P>
 Never again will I believe anything I hear from the mouth of a political 
candidate, because Clinton Reilly may have put it there.

 As an idealistic youth fresh out of college, I served as a district 
coordinator on Reilly's ill-fated no-fault insurance campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee talk between Reilly and anyone on the staff would typically be typed 
and sent by messenger to any staff members who might have missed the idle 
banter (I've saved mine -- very witty). 
</P>
<P>
 Visits to his office were always festive occasions. The staff would muse 
joyfully about the large budget of $63.8 million. Even Reilly had trouble 
containing himself, often announcing to us that he had as much or more money at 
his disposal than the guy running for President, Democrat Michael S. Dukakis. 
Indeed, Reilly himself was at odds as to how to spend all that cash 
</P>
<P>
 So let rivals and journalists say what they will. They haven't experienced 
firsthand the pleasures of Reilly's own little Gomorrah: lunchtime meetings at 
the Marriott while sipping martinis and hearing Reilly extol his own talents as 
a political consultant, all at the insurance industry's expense. Martinis have 
never again tasted that good. 
</P>
<P>
 We may have lost that campaign, but we learned much about politics and its 
players. And I, for one, haven't been able to bring myself to vote since.

 Brown hired Reilly not because she has money to burn but because she wants to 
win. Please don't paint Brown with the same brush you used on her campaign 
manager. Her character is not at all "ill-defined," and this Republican 
believes it to be superior.

THIS SIDE OF HELL; TRINITIES, BY NICK TOSCHES (DOUBLEDAY: $23.95; 435 PP.) ; 
CHINA WHITE, BY PETER MAAS (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $23; 270 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Fred Schruers, Fred Schruers is a contributing editor at Rolling Stone. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a recent Associated Press story (picked up in this newspaper) on the threat 
to American cities from Asian organized crime, one federal prosecutor said: 
"It's the worst of both worlds. They have an international organization that 
gives them access to information and commodities throughout Asia -- and then 
they have local gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the threat addressed, fictionally, in these two accomplished 
thrillers. Both writers are seasoned reporters, authors of respected nonfiction 
works (Maas' "King of the Gypsies," "The Valachi Papers" and "Serpico"; 
Tosches' "Hellfire," the Jerry Lee Lewis biography, and "Dino"). Surely they've 
been aware of each other, as they race toward the retail shelves (and the 
cinemas, with both trumpeting their sale to major studios), with what might be 
seen as the same bucket of goods. 
</P>
<P>
 On closer examination, however, the books are quite different; Tosches has 
more rude energy and eloquence -- shading often into grandiloquence -- and a 
full-scale Mafia subplot. Maas' steelier, serviceable prose goes about its 
business with a nod to the Mafia he's cogently depicted in the past, then 
coasts through with a by-the-numbers love story and a predictable, screenplay 
structure. Tosches is in fact raking his way toward higher ground, toward 
something like Robert Stone's or Russell Banks' incident-rich novels of moral 
quandary. With Tosches, it's a dark night of the soul, as he feverishly follows 
his reluctant Mafioso; with Maas, it's a great night at Elaine's Restaurant, as 
he glibly displays the knack that's made him, as the jacket attests, "author of 
many bestsellers." 
</P>
<P>
 Each book's story ranges from New York to Asia. We begin Tosches' book in the 
company of two anonymous hit men in an East Harlem Italian joint, pull back to 
the grumpily aging Mafia boss, Giuseppe "Joe" DiPietro, and, in the third 
chapter, meet his Chinese counterpart, the aging Chinatown junkie and gang boss 
Chen Fang. These quickly sketched portraits give way to a scene at the Brooklyn 
home of our hero, Johnny DiPietro (who turns out to be one of the hit men) and 
his alienated wife Diane. This Johnny, who advises her to bring home his usual 
video fare ("Tits. Blood. Monsters.") is a far cry from the story's later 
Johnny, who becomes almost Nabokovian is his complexities. 
</P>
<P>
 Tosches takes Johnny there in small steps, with the hinge point being a pact 
with his Uncle Giuseppe. The aging don, sick of seeing the Chinese infringe on 
his turf, has cooked up a plan to usurp their drug profits. Such ambition is 
quixotic in the post-"Godfather" world the tattered Mafia hierarchy inhabits, 
but compelling. In the way Francis Ford Coppola's ambivalent Al Pacino (or 
later, a zealous Andy Garcia) had to take over from the weaklings who'd 
forgotten how to wield ice picks and spread terror, Johnny takes to the task, 
nonetheless fearing (in Tosches' overheated style) that "the reverberations of 
this baptism in evil would be inexorable, that no amount of wealth could bribe 
Charon to ferry him back from hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Along Johnny's path, Drug Enforcement Special Agent Bob Marshall, Nigerian 
smuggler Alhaji Shehu Musa, New York Chinese mobsters Billy Sing and scattered 
cameo players get embroiled in what becomes a war between the Mafia and the 
Chinese Triad gangs; all but the most major players tend to get suckered and 
killed as the body count colorfully rises. (Marshall gets involved in a bit of 
sexual intrigue that would seem implausible had Tosches not prepared the ground 
so well, and rendered the moment so artfully.) 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a group of fine minor characters, what Tosches gives us with the 
extra space he takes is lots of story, and lots of details: how to cook squid, 
how to assassinate by acid, knife, gun, fire, bomb and virus (and how to cover 
one's tracks), how to launder money through bearer bonds, how to tell if your 
Thai wife is cheating ("Usually she will cut her hair and treat you better") 
and -- in a description Maas also provides -- how to cook up commercial 
quantities of the highly pure heroin (No. 4, or "China White") that is the 
lynch-pin of the Triads' grasp for U.S. street territory. 
</P>
<P>
 By bearing down on the resurgent Mafiosi in the person of Johnny, Tosches 
hovers comfortably between a good pulp fiction read and something nobler. 
Here's a typical musing from Johnny: "The world itself seemed to be growing 
dimmer, more magical, more vibrant, but more ominous too, a region of 
unspeakable possibility, sorrow, fear and doleful shades, as in the haunted 
black forest of a dream, disturbing and enchanting and fatal, in the blood." 
Yes, a William Kennedy or an E. L. Doctorow summons such things up with less 
perspiration, but Johnny sees (and partakes of) enough human beastliness to 
lend weight to such earnest underpinnings. 
</P>
<P>
 These two authors may have been somewhat distressed to realize that each of 
their books, in nearing its climax, features twin cargo ships heading for 
American ports. One of the quietly effective passages in Maas' book is his 
enumeration of the container traffic in Port Newark -- 50,000 merchant ships 
per year, a million and a half steel containers, with just 1% of them subject 
to random inspection. Maas' key figure is Hong Kong businessman and gang-lord 
Y. K. Deng, who fled mainland China and Mao's murderous revolutionaries in 
1949, emerging in Hong Kong as a CIA informant and eventually as one of five 
"dragon heads" of the secret societies: "In the annals of organized crime, the 
power of these five men was unparalleled. . . . Only a handful of officers at 
the highest echelon knew the identity of those seated around the teak table. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a consistently distracting element in both novels is the very 
mysteriousness of the Triads, who are center stage as villains. If Maas' 
imagining posits "old Fong" as the 77-year-old Cantonese lung tao 
("dragonhead") of the 14K Society, is he closer to some real-life bad guy than 
Tosches' central bad guy, Ng Tai-Hei, also identified as leader of the 14K 
Society? Both books take a healthy stab at illuminating the Triads' history, 
yet both leave one thirsting for the real scoop on the actual societies. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we get sophisticated variations on the myth of the "inscrutable 
Oriental." Ng's face "revealed nothing" under stress, until a moment later, "he 
allowed himself a slight, ambivalent smile." Yeng, meanwhile, although in 
general a more interesting creation, also has "eyes that never smiled" -- 
though later, his expression, all too typically, is "an enigmatic smile." 
</P>
<P>
 Maas fares better with Deng than with his white-bread characters. We spend a 
good deal of time with priggish former prosecutor Tom MacLean, whose 
CIA-operative Dad (he'll come to find out) once helped Deng traffic in drugs. 
Thanks to that connection, Tom is hired by crusty Manhattan lawyer James B. 
Needham, an aging preppy boor who showcases the book's tin ear for 
"character-revealing" dialogue: "Two daughters is what I've got, but one them 
has given me a grandson. In law school, he is. . . ." Tom, fortuitously for the 
plot, falls for Shannon O'Shea, an ex-nun who happens to be spearheading the 
FBI crackdown on Asian drug traffickers. They have the obligatory, maladroitly 
rendered sex scene and many quarrels, in a romance that's tested, 
TV-drama-style, by the book's painfully hackneyed conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Tosches, by comparison, is remarkably light-footed. His richness of incident 
and detail and his prolix descriptiveness intertwine in an undeniably appealing 
whole. We live through plenty with Johnny DiPietro -- and his leitmotif of a 
breeze, which carries both scary ghosts and promise, ultimately works. Like 
Tosches' haunted nonfictional subjects, Johnny sticks with you, along with the 
credo he comes upon midway through his tangled story: "I feel like a season in 
hell is a small price to pay to get to the other side in this life."

STRICTLY A PRIVATE MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Karl Schoenberger's article about a lovely Japanese garden, why did he have 
to allude to the imagined sexual leanings of people he didn't even know ("In 
Search of Mr. Kato," Oct. 9)? Such comments are unnecessary and out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many unmarried people, Thomasella Hardeman Graham may have elected to 
remain single rather than spend her life regretting a poor marriage, one 
entered into because of what people might think. She could afford to remain 
independent; she did so, and that hardly means that there were no romances with 
male friends in her life. She wouldn't have been the first, nor the last, to 
try to keep her private life private.

'NYPD' CONSULTANT: 'THIS IS EVERY COP'S DREAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When "NYPD Blue" co-creator David Milch and his group of writers and producers 
want to bring a dose of reality to the story lines and cases on "NYPD Blue," 
it's Bill Clark who drops a taste of the Big Apple into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, a 17-year homicide detective with the New York Police Department, is 
also a consulting producer on the hit drama series.He brings a touch of 
authenticity, especially in scenes where detectives are interrogating suspects 
or trying to get information out of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is every cop's dream, to be able to have this kind of job on 
television," says Clark, who is about to retire from the police department to 
work full time on the show. "I have an instinct on how to handle people, and I 
try to bring that into the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, talking about many of the citizens he encounters who commit crimes, 
says: "Most of the time, they're good people who do bad things. I try not to be 
nasty to people. It's a traumatic enough experience to be arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark bears more than a passing resemblance in attitude and demeanor to the 
outspoken Sipowicz on the show. He is quick to smile and loves to joke, but 
colleagues say he has an uncanny insight into people and can tell when they're 
giving him less than the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has a fondness for exotic pet birds that he keeps in his rented Santa 
Monica home. 
</P>
<P>
 But "NYPD Blue" is his bigger passion. "The guys back home in the department 
love the show, they say it's so real -- and it's about time." GREG BRAXTON

 THE GOOD BODY: Asceticism in Contemporary Culture edited by Mary G. Winkler 
and Letha B. Cole (Yale University Press: $27.50; 247 pp.). In spite of a sexy 
cover and fairly simple jacket copy, "The Good Body," a collection of essays 
edited by Mary Winkler and Letha Cole, is anything but a sexy, simple book. The 
12 pieces range in subject from the "dynamic interplay between scientific 
discourse and dominant cultural categories," to the role of the body in 
Flannery O'Connor's work. 
</P>
<P>
 The essays vary widely in intent as well. Some give convincing, scholarly 
arguments regarding the role of weight loss, drugs or PMS in our culture, while 
others seem to be geared more toward providing information. One essay in 
particular, "Eating Disorders, Female Psychology, and Developmental 
Disturbance" by Janet de Groot, is an excellent discussion of the psychological 
factors that contribute to anorexia and bulimia. Another fascinating piece is 
William Monroe's "Flannery O' Connor and the Celebration of Embodiment." 
(Although in all fairness I must confess to a strong personal bias for 
O'Connor's writing.) Looking through the lens of Gnosticism, Monroe's essay 
traces the changes in O'Connor's depiction of physicality as her writing 
matured and health declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Good Body" is a collection that will be of interest primarily to feminist 
scholars and graduate students in psychology or sociology. This is not light 
reading. It is, however, a flawlessly researched, well-organized collection.

ON THE SET; THE LAND OF SEUSS; TNT DOCUMENTARY TAKES A WILD JOURNEY THROUGH THE 
AUTHOR'S AMAZING LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's so hot on the small sound stage where TNT's "In Search of Dr. Seuss" is 
shooting, you could probably cook green eggs and ham on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly isn't fit for a Cat in the Hat. Poor Matt Frewer, who plays Dr. 
Seuss' wily feline, is perspiring buckets attired in a furry cat suit and top 
hat. Kathy Najimy, who plays the inquisitive reporter in the documentary about 
the Pulitzer Prize-winning Dr. Seuss (a.k.a. Theodor Geisel), looks equally 
wilted in a long black dress and high-heeled granny boots. 
</P>
<P>
 But their spirits remain high, even after filming the big musical finale, "Oh, 
the Places You'll Go," countless times. After a quick break, director Vincent 
Paterson yells, 'Action!' and Frewer and Najimy start singing and dancing to 
the audio playback. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot of fun and hard work," Najimy ("Sister Act") recalls a week 
later during another break in the action. "Who knew I would have ended up a 
dancer in the movies? This is like a big ride." 
</P>
<P>
 "In Search of Dr. Seuss," which premieres Sunday on TNT, is a wild ride into 
the life and career of Dr. Seuss, philosopher, humorist, humanist and author of 
such classic children's books as "Green Eggs and Ham," "The Cat in the Hat" and 
"How the Grinch Stole Christmas." Geisel died at age 87 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The film eschews the typical documentary style of talking heads, film clips 
and home movies for a hipper vision of live-action and animated film mixed with 
song. 
</P>
<P>
 Najimy's reporter arrives at the Geisel home to get some background on a story 
she's writing on the private Geisel and his public identity, Dr. Seuss. When 
she finds the book titled "Open a Book, Open Your Imagination," the Cat in the 
Hat (Frewer) becomes her self-appointed tour guide through the world of Seuss. 
Scattered throughout are cameos by David Paymer, Andrea Martin, Patrick 
Stewart, Andrae Crouch, Eileen Brennan, Christopher Lloyd and Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The real stars of the film, though, are production designer Tom Walsh's 
eye-popping Seuss-like sets and costume designer Merrily Murray-Walsh's clever 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are such magical reproductions, I think," Najimy says. "I smell awards 
for these costumes and sets. They are truly brilliant, and I have never been 
one to gush over scenery." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one sets were created to bring the world of Seuss alive. "They are not 
so much recreations of his books as collages," Walsh explains. "The whole show 
is a collage of 50 plus years of his work. We have been working on the project 
well over 2 1/2 years. It has been an ongoing collaboration of writing the 
script and conceiving the visuals simultaneously." 
</P>
<P>
 Seuss, Walsh says, had an extraordinary use of the palate. "He is absolutely 
fearless in his use of color and crayon colors, kids colors. He was a big kid 
who never grew up." 
</P>
<P>
 The project has been celebration of not only his work and his life but his 
books, Walsh says. "This has been great because we have been able to be 
theatrical like Seuss. It's not real. You are in a non-dimensional sort of 
space. In leaving it a little bit more free and loose, we don't have to make 
anything literal." 
</P>
<P>
 "The story we chose is not so much him the person but his career as a writer," 
says producer Joni Levin. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for Levin and writer Kevin C. Clarke was how to bring Seuss' 
books to life, "instead of just having someone read," Levin says. "So we have 
all different ways. We do have Robin Williams doing a reading of 'Cat in the 
Hat.' That made sense to us. There's a dance number for 'Green Eggs and Ham' 
and 'Oh, the Places You'll Go," which is the finale of the show. 'Yertle the 
Turtle' is not so much a dance, but an all-out musical number that's a gospel 
song. Our main goal was keeping the integrity of all his work." 
</P>
<P>
 "In Search of Dr. Seuss" has been a very ambitious project. Perhaps a little 
too ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the most difficult thing is that you have got 21 sets and some days 
you are on two sets," Levin says. "You don't have time for rehearsals because 
you are dealing with cameos who are committed for the next year-and-a-half and 
it's getting them for a day here or there. So that kind of pace is grueling. 
The turnaround of getting the set in and out and not having that extra money 
for labor ... it always makes it tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Najimy acknowledges that she never read Dr. Seuss as a youngster. "I grew up 
very poor, and so any books that I had were rented from the library," she 
explains. "They didn't allow Dr. Seuss in the library then. He certainly wasn't 
in the school libraries. You'll see when you watch this project that they 
thought he was too wild. They thought he was too risky." 
</P>
<P>
 But now she's a huge fan. "I do a lot of political theater," Najimy says. "If 
someone can merge politics and entertainment, that really excites me. I think 
he does this. He has a strong point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 "In Search of Dr. Seuss" premieres Sunday at 5 and 7 p.m. on TNT; the cable 
channel will also air "Dr. Seuss" animated specials throughout the day Sunday 
beginning at 6 a.m. and air specials throughout the month.

 JOHN LAUTNER, ARCHITECT edited by Frank Escher (Artemis/London: $90; 296 pp.) 
This book celebrates the career of a neglected giant, who enriched the 
Southland for over 50 years until his death on Oct. 24.His atypical Chemosphere 
house, rising like a slender mushroom from the Hollywood Hills, and the 
thrilling concrete span of "Silvertop," a landmark home above Silver Lake, have 
been widely reproduced. But enthusiasts have had to wait for this sumptuous 
European publication to discover the full range of John Lautner's achievement. 
Highlights include the free-form Arango house, soaring above Acapulco (above), 
and the petal-vaulted Elrod house in Palm Springs; dramatically cantilevered 
restaurants and pools. Wood and concrete, art and technology are pushed to 
their limits. Lautner was the true heir of Frank Lloyd Wright, with whom he 
worked as an apprentice in the 1930s before opening his office in L.A. He was 
an original striving for the unique, drawing his inspiration from the site, 
unbending and outspoken. "The purpose of Architecture is to . . . create 
timeless, free, joyous spaces for all activities in life," he writes in a 
headline-type foreword. "What is commonly known as Architecture are styles -- 
Greek, Colonial, French, English, Modern, etc. These are known merchandise that 
Bankers will finance and Real Estate sell," he continues. Such talk scared away 
potential clients. Happily, there always were a few adventurers who encouraged 
him to fresh flights of invention. Like Wright in his old age, Lautner in his 
nineties enjoyed an overdue burst of attention and employment. Michael Webb

 CHELSEA GIRLS by Eileen Myles (Black Sparrow: $13; 276 pp.) Oddly enough, the 
worst thing about "Chelsea Girls," by Eileen Myles is also the best. Ego.Myles 
collection of short stories is so unabashedly solipsistic, so confidant in its 
own self-absorption, that she takes chances and has pay-offs few other writers 
would be willing to risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The main character -- who is named Eileen Myles -- is a lesbian alcoholic with 
no money, no job and no qualms about mooching from other people. The writing is 
nearly identical in every piece, so it feels like a chopped-up, digressive 
autobiography rather than conventional short stories. Here is Myles describing 
her photography on the front of a book of poems: " . . . I stand with these 
crooked bangs and big bags under my eyes against the white wall of my 
apartment. You can see the buzzer about maybe a foot and a half from my right 
shoulder. My face looks puffy and shapeless, fortunately I have kind of a big 
mouth so it sort of works." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be easy to dismiss "Chelsea Girls" as poetic hot air if Myles weren't 
so smart and funny. Somehow, she manages to hold our attention in spite of the 
closed-in quality of her work. This is writing with big courage, big talent and 
a big self image. It would be really interesting to see what Myles might do 
facing the world instead of the mirror.

 HALO by John Loveday (Harcourt Brace: $19.95; 286 pp.) Set in the mid-1800s, 
"Halo" chronicles the journey of a small band of pioneers traveling along the 
Oregon trail.The protagonist, Scrag, is a man-boy who falls in love with 
Lorelei, a woman old enough to be his mother. Lorelei's pubescent daughter, 
Justly, and Sylvester, a well-educated photographer, make up the other major 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the thoroughlines of "Halo" is Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass." After 
Sylvester introduces the book to Scrag and Lorelei, they have many 
conversations about the meaning of the poems, all of which feel contrived. 
Another problem lies in Sylvester's photography. He takes artistic pictures of 
the journey to record " . . . truth. The record of how it was. Here, under this 
particular bit of God's Heaven, at this particular moment." Later in the novel 
his pictures cause enormous suffering in a manner that could have been a sad 
and surprising plot turn, but instead becomes a statement about truth and art.  
</P>
<P>
 "Halo" is written in an engaging style, and Lovejoy has some fine details. 
Hopefully, his future work will feel more natural.

 BODYRHYTHMS: Chronobiology and Peak Performance by Lynne Lamberg (Morrow: $25; 
274 pp.) Chronobiology, or the study of how the body functions at various times 
of day, is a relatively new science.It is believed that most people are 
physiologically programmed to be on a schedule geared toward working during the 
day and sleeping at night. According to "Bodyrhythms," Lynne Lamberg's friendly 
yet plodding examination of the subject, the impaired abilities of employees 
working against their on natural body clocks have been implicated in many 
terrible accidents, including the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bodyrhythms" goes on to explore ways one can use their own body clock to help 
various ailments, from jet lag to cancer. For example, studies have shown that 
cancer cells reproduce more rapidly at certain times of day, perhaps allowing 
medications to have a greater effect, since cells are more vulnerable while 
they are dividing. Another interesting area Lamberg touches on is depression. 
There are large deviations in the sleep patterns of clinically depressed 
people, and research has shown that radically changing the hours one sleeps may 
actually improve symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some intriguing information, "Bodyrhythms" is something of a chore to 
read. Lamberg is clearly enthusiastic about her topic, yet lacks the real sense 
for language that makes a book come alive. There is also a problem of genre. 
"Bodyrhythms" lies in a kind of purgatory between self-help and science, so 
that some areas are a little silly, for example, a questionnaire to determine 
if you are a "lark" or an "owl," while other sections are quite technical.

 THE SCIENCE OF DESIRE: The Search for the Gay Gene and the Biology of Behavior 
by Dean Hamer and Peter Copeland. (Simon & Schuster: $23; 272 pp.) "Genes are 
hardware. They make a person human, produce a penis or a vagina, and allow 
sexual activity. . . . The software is the difficult part to translate. . . . 
An IBM operating under DOS can have many varieties, but it will never behave 
like a Mac. Likewise, some men probably are born with genes that ensure they 
will be sexually attracted to women -- and some to men -- all of their lives." 
So writes Dean Hamer in "The Science of Desire," a meticulous, highly 
engrossing book that, in plain language, explains how the presence of a gay 
gene was discovered and what it may mean for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1991, Hamer began work on a study funded by the National 
Institute of Health that used a combination of interviews and sophisticated 
blood tests to investigate patterns of male homosexuality in families. What he 
found was nothing short of amazing. Thirty-three out of 40 pairs of gay 
brothers shared DNA from an area on the tip of the X chromosome -- much too 
high a percentage to be random. Hamer also discovered the gay gene is recessive 
and passed down through the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 It helps when reading "The Science of Desire" to have a rudimentary knowledge 
of how genes work, but a committed reader can get through without it. Hamer -- 
or perhaps his co-writer, Peter Copeland -- displays a real gift for rendering 
highly complex materials understandable. In addition, many ancillary questions 
such as why a gay gene might be passed down, and what are the ethical 
implications of this discovery, are handled in an informative and thought 
provoking way.

TELEPHONING IN MEXICAN SUNLIGHT, BY GALWAY KINNELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talking with my beloved in New York 
</P>
<P>
 I stood at the outdoor public telephone 
</P>
<P>
 in Mexican sunlight, in my purple shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone had called it a man/woman 
</P>
<P>
 shirt.The phrase irked me. But 
</P>
<P>
 then I remembered that Rainer Maria 
</P>
<P>
 Rilke, who until he was seven wore 
</P>
<P>
 dresses and had long yellow hair, 
</P>
<P>
 wrote that the girl he almost was 
</P>
<P>
 made her bed in his ear and slept him the world. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought, OK this shirt will clothe the other 
</P>
<P>
 in me. 
</P>
<P>
 As we fell into long-distance love talk 
</P>
<P>
 a squeaky chittering started up all around, 
</P>
<P>
 and every few seconds came a sudden loud 
</P>
<P>
 buzzing. I half expected to find 
</P>
<P>
 the insulation on the telephone line 
</P>
<P>
 laid open under the pressure of our talk 
</P>
<P>
 leaking low-frequency noises. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few yards away a dozen hummingbirds, 
</P>
<P>
 gorgets going drab or blazing 
</P>
<P>
 according as the sun struck them, 
</P>
<P>
 stood on their tail rudders in a circle 
</P>
<P>
 around my head, transfixed 
</P>
<P>
 by the flower-likeness of the shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps also by a flush rising into my face, 
</P>
<P>
 for a word -- one with a thick sound, 
</P>
<P>
 as if a porous vowel had sat soaking up 
</P>
<P>
 saliva while waiting to get spoken, 
</P>
<P>
 possibly the name of some flower 
</P>
<P>
 that hummingbirds love, perhaps 
</P>
<P>
 "honeysuckle" or "hollyhock" 
</P>
<P>
 or "phlox" -- just then shocked me 
</P>
<P>
 with its suddenness, and this time 
</P>
<P>
 apparently did burst the insulation, 
</P>
<P>
 letting the word sound in the open 
</P>
<P>
 where all could hear, for these tiny, irascible, 
</P>
<P>
 nectar-addicted puritans jumped back, 
</P>
<P>
 all at once, fast, as if the air gasped. 
</P>

FOCUS; FOLLOWING THEIR OWN ACTS; 'CAGNEY & LACEY' SIX YEARS LATER -- THE JOBS 
HAVE CHANGED BUT HAS THE CHEMISTRY REMAINED? 
</P>

<P>
 Six years after we last saw Mary Beth Lacey and Chris Cagney at the 14th 
Precinct of the New York Police Department, life has changed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 As viewers of "Cagney & Lacey: The Return" will see on CBS Sunday night, Lacey 
(Tyne Daly) has retired from the NYPD and is blissfully at home raising her 
young daughter and spending quality time with her husband Harvey (John Karlen). 
Cagney (Sharon Gless) is married to a high-powered attorney (James Naughton) 
who is a Friend of Bill's -- as in President Bill Clinton. She's been promoted 
from a street cop with the 14th Precinct to an investigator for the district 
attorney's office. And she's in denial about the menopause she's going through. 
</P>
<P>
 For a television audience that watched the 1982-88 "Cagney & Lacey" grapple 
with social issues and win more than a handful of Emmys along the way, another 
groundbreaking detective series set in New York has grabbed their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the way, 'NYPD Blue,' which is my favorite show on the air, is 'Cagney & 
Lacy' in drag," says Barney Rosenzweig, the executive producer of the series 
and the reunion movie, who is married to Gless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people will love us as we are now," says Gless by phone, months after 
the movie was completed. "Six years is a long time and women change a lot in 
that period of time. We just didn't pull any punches. The women are six years 
older and that's now how we are doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also reprising their roles from the series is Martin Kove as Isbecki; Carl 
Lumbly as Marcus Petrie; Al Waxman as Lt. Samuels; Robert Hegyes as Esposito; 
Paul Mantee as Corassa, and Merry Clayton as Verna Dee Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 And this movie won't be the last viewers will see of these characters. "Cagney 
& Lacey: Together Again" will air later this season on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 During its six years on CBS, "Cagney & Lacey" was one of the network's most 
acclaimed shows, receiving two Emmys as best drama series. Daly won the best 
actress Emmy four times and Gless won twice. The series never shied away from 
controversy, tackling such heady topics as rape, breast cancer and alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show is about relationships and, specifically, about the relationships 
between these two women," explains Rosenzweig. "It's also about the 
relationship they have with the men in their lives and their careers. We always 
used to say this is Hepburn and Tracy without the sex." 
</P>
<P>
 The story in "The Return" finds the gang of the 14th Precinct gathering at 
Cagney's townhouse to celebrate the retirement of Lt. Samuels (Waxman). While 
there, Harvey has a massive heart attack. Because the family is financially 
strapped, Lacey decides to return to work. But re-entering the work force is 
impossible for Lacey because of the much-younger competition. Cagney comes to 
the rescue and asks her to become an investigator at the D.A.'s office. 
Together, they try to solve a difficult case dealing with stolen guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good time going back and checking in with these ladies again," says 
Daly, from Townshend, Tenn., where she is currently filming the CBS midseason 
replacement "Christy." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was also difficult. "There was a great load of baggage with this thing, 
you know? All of that was along with the ride, at least for the first couple of 
weeks and then it began to be about itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Another difficult aspect, Daly says, was "making sure it was a discreet movie 
that stands by itself and not an episode. We had all practiced making episodes 
of 'Cagney & Lacey,' but none of us practiced making movies. That takes 
different stuff. I was really interested that it stand on its own, and that 
remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Gless acknowledges she was nervous about stepping back into Cagney's shoes 
because she was following her "own act. It's oftentimes easier to step in and 
create the role anew, but I had already created Cagney. So to try to follow 
that. ... And she's still six years older." 
</P>
<P>
 She finally felt comfortable by the end of shooting the first movie. "I said, 
'I get it. Now let's start.' But we hit the ground running and you need a 
little time to reacquaint yourself, especially since we are spinning all new 
yarns here." 
</P>
<P>
 Gless wasn't pleased with the writer's idea to have Cagney married. "I thought 
it was wrong," she says. "But the writers had Barney convinced this was the way 
to go. I just really kicked and screamed. Barney said, 'Would you calm down? I 
didn't say it would last.' He said, 'Sharon. She's is six years older. She has 
to try this. She thought she was in love.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gless says, she was uncomfortable playing the marriage. "You'll see 
very quickly that they are just totally different people. I guess I had to 
rationalize it. I guess she got caught up in the high life of this man." 
</P>
<P>
 Far easier was working with Daly. "It's always a pleasure. Doing Cagney and 
Lacey, that part was easy. When Tyne did a guest spot for me on (the 1990-92 
CBS series) 'The Trials of Rosie O' Neill,' that was very strange because we 
weren't playing Cagney and Lacey. But this time around, it was very 
comfortable. We knew who these women were." 
</P>
<P>
 And if these movies perform well in the ratings, don't be surprised if Cagney 
& Lacey reunite once a year for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cagney & Lacey: The Return" airs Sunday at 9 p.m on CBS.

 Even before "Wayne's World" there was a market for, like, really excellent 
dudes who lived to party hearty. The 1989 Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure 
(KTLA Sunday at 6 p.m.), directed by Stephen Herek and starring Keanu Reeves 
and Alex Winter as B. & T., found it. But it's a good movie ... not.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a 
thinly veiled allegory about the breakup of the Soviet Union. Here we find the 
crew of the starship Enterprise rescuing Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) and Bones 
McCoy (DeForest Kelley) from a murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 As Peyton Flanders, the demented nanny of te 1992 hit The Hand That Rocks the 
Cradle (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), Rebecca De Mornay has a picture-perfect 
prettiness; the only time you register a real person ticking behind the mask is 
when her eyes glaze over in rapt, crazed calculation. She craves the perfect 
All-American family so much she's willing to kill for it. At its best, the film 
is a bright, nasty psychological thriller with a joker up its sleeve, but its 
overall design is predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Overboard (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.) is a 1987 Hollywood reworking of Italian 
director Lina Wertmuller's nifty "Swept Away." Goldie Hawn is cast as a rich 
harridan who gets her comeuppance from hambone sexy proletarian Kurt Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders of the Lost Ark (KTLA Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.), the extravagant 1981 
Spielberg-Lucas salute to the Saturday matinee serials stars Harrison Ford, of 
course, as Indiana Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 With its predictable city-slicker vs. Southern-cracker shenanigans, the 1992 
My Cousin Vinny (Fox Tuesday at 8 p.m.) takes off when Joe Pesci, in the title 
role as a swaggering New York lawyer who only recently passed the bar on his 
sixth try, shows up to defend his cousin and his friend in a mistaken-identity 
case. Marisa Tomei won an Oscar as Vinnie's sharp, svelte girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone With the Wind, the most beloved Hollywood classic of them all, airs on 
KTLA in two parts: Wednesday at 7 p.m. and Thursday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Willow (KTLA Friday at 7:30 p.m.) is an agreeable enough 1988 
adventure-fantasy in which the children of a little person (Warwick Davis) 
discover a baby girl who, according to prophecy, will bring down Jean Marsh's 
evil queen. Directed by Ron Howard and based on a story by George Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET's Saturday night double feature is composed of two of Carole Lombard's 
best: Twentieth Century (at 9 p.m.) and Nothing Sacred (at 10:30 p.m.).

LIBERAL 'ROSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last two years, the "Charlie Rose" show on PBS has become nothing more 
than a propaganda platform for the Clinton Administration.Has anyone else 
noticed? 
</P>
<P>
 Rose fills his guest list with Administration appointees, congressional 
Democrats, sympathetic media and Hollywood celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 When a conservative does appear, Rose surrounds him or her with Clinton 
apologists to dilute whatever points they are honestly trying to make.

CMMENTARY; FALL TRENDS: DRAMA IN, CREDITS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE WERTS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So I missed the first couple weeks of the fall TV season. There are worse 
things than going on vacation and returning to prime time already in progress. 
You get a whole different perspective when you come back to find everything 
different from the way you left it. A few nifty trends have already caught my 
eye: 
</P>
<P>
 DRAMAS ARE DEAD -- NOT!: Well, look what turns out to be the Numero Uno 
program format this season. Here we learn again that what goes around comes 
around. Ten years ago, sitcoms were dead until "The Cosby Show" resurrected 
them. Then dramas were dead -- till "NYPD Blue" proved there was life in 
52-minute form. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the only new breakout hit is NBC's "ER." And Fox, of all networks, is 
completely banking on its hours ("X-Files," "Melrose Place," "90210," "New York 
Undercover"), after its new sitcoms have died (adios, "Hardball" and "Wild 
Oats") and its veterans are struggling (even "The Simpsons"). 
</P>
<P>
 It seems we viewers want what we have not got. When dramas dominated, we got 
bored and sought sitcoms. Now we're sitcomed-out, and clearly ready for 
something serious, stylish and adult. Hence the solid starts for newcomers 
"ER," "The Cosby Mysteries" and "Under Suspicion," and the ratings improvement 
of returnees "Picket Fences" and "Homicide." 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD IS IN: Meaning good shows, well-made shows, shows about something. 
Amazing? Not really. The rare drama that did get ordered in the recent 
less-than-hospitable network climate had to be good. And unique. 
</P>
<P>
 So there's nothing cookie-cutter about "ER," which persuasively creates a 
distinctive sense of place and action rhythms in the best tradition of "Hill 
Street Blues" and "NYPD Blue." There's nothing cliched, either, about CBS' 
Friday-night cop mystery "Under Suspicion," which operates in its own stylized 
environment, taking an interior approach to police work as a moral minefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every creative series is thriving, of course. ABC's serious "My So-Called 
Life," airing Thursdays at the normally lighthearted hour of 8 p.m., battles an 
audience reluctance to get dragged into its characters' emotional quagmires. 
Monday's sensitive and deft Fox family drama "Party of Five" isn't in the right 
place, either, following the high camp of "Melrose Place." 
</P>
<P>
 But the season's casualties thus far have all been shows that artistically 
deserved the fate. "Daddy's Girls," "Fortune Hunter," "McKenna," even "Martin 
Short" -- it's hard to shed a tear over any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD IS IN, PART 2: If it's nice to know that quality still counts, it's also 
great to see that good, as in generosity of spirit, is staging its own 
prime-time comeback. CBS' "Touched by an Angel" is finding an audience for its 
sentimental spirituality, but even more rewarding is the series success of "Due 
South" in CBS' Thursday-night lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE: How about those opening credits this season? ABC 
has been true to its word about dumping theme songs. "Ellen" just starts cold 
-- and feels a little chilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Theme songs aren't always just dead space. They really do help set the tone 
for a show. The cartoon that starts "The Nanny" lets you know this is fantasy 
sitcom stuff; the music, grainy film and unstable cameras kicking off "NYPD 
Blue" and "Homicide" introduce the shows' unexpected styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows that don't go the theme-song route still need some sort of signature or 
unifying theme (the "Home Improvement" segue bumpers, the "Frasier" scene title 
cards). 
</P>
<P>
 And hey, so does a network. Kudos to NBC's sleek new on-air look, with elegant 
graphics, clever peacock logos, and those added-value "NBC Moments" end credits 
with clips from vintage NBC shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Little things, sure, but they're building blocks to success. Confidence is 
very sexy. You can also see it doing wonders for Jay Leno these days -- 
revitalizing his show and transforming his also-ran image. And as we all know 
in the TV world, image is everything.

PALM LATITUDES: THE SCENE; POETRY, PIXELATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Malaika Brown 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reading is already 10 minutes behind schedule and Merilene M. Murphy is 
racing to get the connections right. When at last she gets the modem and 
"videophone" configured, the call that she -- and everyone else in her 
Telepoetics Salon Hollywood -- has been waiting for arrives.It's poet Heather 
Haley in Vancouver and another confluence of verse and video is about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Knott does the first reading and seconds after he begins, the videophone 
captures a frozen moment from his reading. A still, black-and-white image 
flares up on a TV screen here and is transmitted, with a real-time audio feed, 
to another poets' hangout in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Telepoetics, an electronic marriage of poetry and pixelation. Its 
L.A. hub is Murphy's salon. Local poets who have ridden the Telepoetic wave 
incluse Wanda Coleman, Joel Lipman, Rafael Alvarado and Theresa Stone. Their 
words and images have been sent over telephone wires to poets in Chicago, 
Paris, Vancouver, Seattle, Boston and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "It adds to the artistry," says Murphy, a poet herself, who credits Kit 
Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz of Santa Monica's Electronic Cafe (a gathering 
place for cybernautical artists) with the inspiration for the new poetry 
platform. "It isn't TV; it's guerrilla theater at best and cable spaghetti at 
worst." 
</P>
<P>
 The Telepoetics networks is growing, in large part because of Murphy. She 
ships the videophones, the brainchild of local inventor Frank Perelman, to 
poetry outlets for a 30-day trial. Half a dozen venues are now using the gizmo, 
which costs less than $300. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, naturally, has a poetic take on the whole thing. "Telepoetic is what 
happens in the fast lane of rebound technology in the hands of poets," says 
Murphy. "We are poet-techs on a telecommunicative poetry mission." Malaika 
Brown

LEFT WANTING MORE; WOMEN, ANIMALS, AND VEGETABLES: ESSAYS AND STORIES, BY 
MAXINE KUMIN (NEW YORK: W. W. NORTON & COMPANY: $25, CLOTH; 299 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Christopher Merrill, Christopher Merrill is the author, most recently of 
Watch Fire, a collection of poems from White Pine Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why do poets turn to prose H. Lawrence shuttled back and forth between poetry 
and prose, one genre feeding the other in his search for aesthetic and 
spiritual meaning. Elizabeth Bishop, ever alert to formal innovations, 
discovered in her short fiction new ways to confront the harshest facts of her 
own autobiography. And Joseph Brodsky suggests that Marina Tsvetetaeva's prose 
enabled her to expand "the possibilities of language," mitigating the isolation 
central to the experience of any great lyric poet. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, less noble reasons to trade dancing for walking, as Paul 
Valery might have put it, including the need to pay the bills, a craving for a 
larger audience or simply the desire to keep busy between poems. This last is 
what seems to govern a significant portion of Maxine Kumin's new collection of 
essays and stories, "Women, Animals, and Vegetables." "But it is good for poets 
to undertake prose from time to time," she writes in "Have Saddle, Will 
Travel," an essay about the hazards faced by an avid horsewoman on the poetry 
circuit, "and it is good for the rider to adapt to a different way of going." 
</P>
<P>
 The author of 10 volumes of poetry, including "Up Country," for which she 
received the Pulitzer Prize in 1973, and seven previous books of prose, in much 
of her new collection Kumin celebrates the simple life she has fashioned over 
30 years on a farm in central New Hampshire. A tumbledown house and 200 acres 
"magicked" her and her husband when they first saw it. "Innocence protected us 
from appreciating the enormity of the restoration we were about to undertake," 
she admits. "We were young and eager and almost totally ignorant of country 
ways." "Women, Animals, and Vegetables" reveals how well-schooled they have 
become in farm life. "I am a transplant whose new roots go deep," she says 
proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumin describes the pleasures of raising and riding horses, of gardening and 
mushrooming, of learning how in the country "Things have a way of balancing 
out(.)" She has a poet's virtues: an eye for detail, an ear for graceful 
phrasing and an aphoristic bent -- "Foraging for mushrooms has its own visceral 
pleasures: We reap where we did not sow, paper, mulch, or water." This is a 
book many readers will find companionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, though, will consider her essays, many of which were written to order, 
to be too short and occasional in nature to fully satisfy, while the stories 
read like notes toward fictions -- and predictable ones at that. Only in 
"Jicama Without Expectations," her longest and most ambitious essay, does Kumin 
offer a sustaining vision of her rural experience. She takes us through a year 
on the farm, and the result is delightful. "All is as workable as Latin 
grammar," she says of her garden, which yields 800 pounds of produce: "amo, 
amas, amat among the brassicas; hic, haec, hoc in a raised bed lively with 
parsnip foliage." She discovers at every turn reasons to rhapsodize -- sleigh 
rides, first light, "geese going over, baying like beagles in the dawn sky." 
And when she concludes the penultimate paragraph with a quote from Stanley 
Kunitz -- "What do I want of my life?/More! More!" -- readers may wish for the 
same from her own work. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumin has wisely chosen to include, by way of epigraph, one of her best recent 
poems, "The Word." Riding in the October woods, she and her horse surprise a 
doe. "Come back! I want to call to her," the poet cries, wishing to tell her 
that when she feeds birds they perch on her arm, "permitting (her) briefly/ to 
stand in for a tree(.)" And some mornings a vixen lets her "observe the 
education/of her kits" -- a gift for which Kumin is profoundly grateful, for 
she knows the "word" the fox uses to command her young is the same one she is 
"searching for." 
</P>
<P>
 Its sound is o-shaped and unencumbered,  
</P>
<P>
 the see-through color of river,  
</P>
<P>
 airy as the topmost evergreen fingers  
</P>
<P>
 and soft as pine duff underfoot  
</P>
<P>
 where the doe lies down out of sight:  
</P>
<P>
 take me in, tell me the word.  
</P>
<P>
 Kumin's readers will mourn the absence of that word in the essays and stories 
of "Women, Animals, and Vegetables"; in her poem they will find it is a vital 
and mysterious specter.

PALM LATITUDES: HOPE & GLORY; GOD AND COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Raphael 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Saturday night in Ojai and the boomers in boots are doing the electric 
slide to a Diamond Rio tune in a parking lot of the Holy Cross Lutheran Church. 
The pastor is dancing, too, decked out in Wrangler boots and Levis. 
</P>
<P>
 What's this? Lutherans loosening up? 
</P>
<P>
 "We are God's frozen chosen," laughs the pastor, Curt Christiansen, 34. "But 
Martin Luther said 500 years ago that the church needed to speak to the people. 
He translated Latin into German and borrowed tunes from pubs," he says, to draw 
people into church. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward five centuries. Organ music reigns and, as Christiansen notes, 
"most of my generation is not in church with me." He began to wonder if there 
was a connection. 
</P>
<P>
 So Christiansen, 34, inserted flyers in the Ojai paper last summer reading "If 
God were riding in your truck, He'd listen to country" and announcing "God's 
Country Goodtime Hour" with "line dancing following worship." 
</P>
<P>
 And they came, the bearded, ponytailed, granny-gowned sinners of New Age Ojai, 
to scarf up Tex Mex, buy T-shirts, or, like lapsed Episcopalian Geoff Howard, 
39, "to check it out." Members listen to sermons whose topics include the 
pastor's '70 Ford pickup, and Christian sex (rated R for "relevance, respect 
and relationship," says Christiansen, "and more fun than it sounds"). After the 
service they dance to a band called -- what else? -- the Honkytonk Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance has been steadily rising, says Pastor Curt, who is nonetheless 
continuing his search for ways to make church "less churchy." He's adding few 
new steps to the repertoire. After a recent sermon on "Dancing in God's Will," 
he encouraged his congregation to get up and waltz. 
</P>
<P>
 "People our age have such a hard time believing the church could be relevant," 
Christiansen says. "But it's our responsibility to try and communicate the 
message. It's a hard sell, but it's a good product. We got eternal life, we got 
joy and it's all free."Judy Raphael

SHELF HELP; NEEDLE IN A SLUSH PILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's your secret fantasy, admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of pecking away on the keyboard, you finally finish that Great 
American novel or memoir and ship it off -- all 700 pages of it, double-spaced 
-- to a New York publishing house. Then comes the call that changes your life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think you're a genius and your book will be a bestseller," says some guy 
in a bow-tie. "Your check for 1 million dollars is in the mail." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, dream on. Your chances of getting an unsolicited manuscript read these 
days, let alone published, are extremely slim. Most of the large publishers 
won't accept them, and they cast an equally dubious eye on authors who send in 
book proposals or synopses without the help of a literary agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Random House is one of the few mega-firms that still reads free-lance 
manuscripts. They land every day in the so-called "slush pile," collecting 
under a dark stairway near the receptionist's desk, and editors sift through 
them in hopes of finding a gem. 
</P>
<P>
 Submissions run the gamut from bodice-ripping fantasies to the confessional 
dramas of Vietnam Veterans. Self-improvement manuals abound, along with 
religious poetry, pulp science fiction and epic family histories. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may discover a winner, who knows?" says Harold Evans, president of Random 
House. "The odds are against it, but it's worth a look." 
</P>
<P>
 At his direction, young editors gather monthly in the conference room, order 
in pizza and divvy up the mail. Their mood is festive, but efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bacchanal of slush," says editor Jonathan Karp. "And there's a general 
rule: You may be innocent until proven guilty on the outside, but in here 
writers are presumed guilty unless they convince us otherwise. Unless the first 
few pages are really good, they'll go right back to the author." 
</P>
<P>
 Some decisions are easy. Page Dickinson, a marketing coordinator, quickly 
rejected a sex manual with illustrations provided by the author. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drawings weren't good," she explains. "No expertise whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Other decisions are tougher, because some folks send in highly personal 
manuscripts, baring their souls to a bunch of strangers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think writing is easy, and it isn't," says editor Enrica Gadler. "You 
have an intimate encounter with them (in the slush pile) and they throw their 
heart and soul at you. Then you have to turn them away." 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection rate runs 99% or higher. But sometimes lightning strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Mary Cahill, a suburban teacher, who was told by several agents and 
publishers that her novel "Carpool" was amusing but not marketable. Then she 
sent it to the Random House slush pile, and editor Jennifer Ash was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the company gave Cahill a $10,000 advance and went on to sell more 
than 13,000 copies, which is quite good for a first novel. Today, the 
Maryland-based author has an agent and is working on three new book projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people what I told myself," she says with a laugh. "You have to be 
crazy and persistent. Never give up, even though it's a one in a million shot. 
If you're happy with those odds, you, too, can be a published writer."

 TWILIGHT OVER BURMA: My Life as a Shan Princess by Inge Sargent (University of 
Hawaii Press: $14.95; 216 pp., illustrated, paperback original). After 
Austrian-born Inge Sargent married the gentle Burmese student she met in the 
U.S., she discovered he was the Prince of Hsipaw, hereditary ruler of a state 
in Northeastern Burma.The royal couple worked to improve the lives of their 
subjects, eliminating feudal land tenure, developing the region's agricultural 
and mineral resources and introducing modern health care. Their life together 
ended in 1962, when the brutal Ne Win regime came to power. The Prince was 
imprisoned and almost certainly executed, although the government still denies 
any knowledge of his fate; Sargent was forced to flee Burma with their 
children. Her memoir bears witness to the charm of the Shan people and the 
destruction of their happiness by a savagely repressive dictatorship.

 WHERE THE MORNING LIGHT'S STILL BLUE Personal Essays About Idaho edited by 
William Studebaker and Rick Ardinger (University of Idaho Press: $15.95; 200 
pp., paperback original). Idaho remains one of the most thinly populated 
regions in America: More than one-third of the state -- 20 million acres -- is 
national forest, and these brief essays celebrate the beauty of the rivers, 
forests and lakes.In "Flying Among the Osprey," Gino Sky articulates the love 
of nature the authors share: "I call the place where I live Rhymes Creek, for 
that is what this place does for me -- make my body rhyme in a way few places 
ever have." Lynn Langer Meeks offers a change of pace in "Ranching With the 
Wind in Sugar Loaf Valley," a comic piece about tending cattle during the harsh 
northern winter.

 AMERICAN VISA by Wang Ping (Coffee House Press: $11.95; 179 pp., paperback 
original). Wang's linked stories trace the unhappy life of Haizao, a girl whose 
name means Seaweed in Chinese.The least-favored child of a lower-middle class 
family in the People's Republic, Seaweed volunteers to work in a remote village 
to escape the cruelty of her relatives. Her travels expand her vision of the 
world and her place in it. "The Story of Ju" depicts the desperation of a 
powerless peasant girl in the countryside; "Chu Jia" examines the struggles of 
two generations of women to achieve even moderate happiness in arranged 
marriages. Fleeing the oppressive life in China, Seaweed emigrates to America 
and discovers a strange new world that seems both liberating and confining.

 PACIFIC WAR DIARY by James F. Fahey, edited by Von Hardesty (University of 
Washington Press: $29; 193 pp.) . James Fahey (1918-1991) served on the light 
cruiser U.S.S. Montpelier, engaging the Japanese off the Solomons, the 
Marianas, the Philippines, Okinawa, Borneo and China. Initially published in 
1963, his journal offers a typical bluejacket's view of the war. The most 
moving chapters recount the devastation Fahey witnessed at Hiroshima and the 
rest of Japan immediately in 1945. This illustrated abridgment takes on a 
renewed topicality as the 50th anniversary of the end of the War in the Pacific 
approaches.

 NEITHER WOLF NOR DOG: On Forgotten Roads With an Indian Elder by Kent Nerburn 
(New World Library: $11.95; 291 pp., paperback original). A curious set of 
circumstances brought Kent Nerburn to the old Lakota man he identifies only as 
"Dan."During a rambling journey through the high plains, Dan dictated his 
reflections on two centuries of inter-ethnic hostility and the abuse of the 
land of his ancestors. Deploring the generic images of drunks and sages that 
prevent many Americans from seeing Indians as individual human beings, Dan 
declares, "If we looked too long at the past we would be too angry to live. You 
try to make it up to us by making us into heroes and wise people in all your 
books and movies. That's fine for you. But I can still go to a museum and see 
my grandmother's skull in a case and hear someone talk about it as an 
artifact."

 ACROSS THE BRIDGE by Mavis Gallant (Carroll & Graf: $10.95; 198 pp.). These 
gentle stories have a nostalgic tone that suggests a faded watercolor.Three of 
the stories focus on a woman and her two daughters adjusting to their shifting 
fortunes in Montreal: A carefully circumscribed area of the city becomes the 
world for one daughter, and she carries her prejudice throughout her life. 
Gallant captures the tremulous uncertainty of a young woman poised on the brink 
of adulthood in the title story. A prolonged lunch in a cheap cafe enables the 
narrator to accept a stolid but reliable fiance the significance of the meal 
becomes "a small secret, insignificant, but it belonged to the true life that 
was almost ready to let me in. And so it did; and, yes, it made me happy."

BOLD, BEAUTIFUL AND WHOLESOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maitland Ward gives new meaning to the word "wholesome." With her long blond 
hair, bright blue eyes and warm, innocent smile, it seems as if the 17-year-old 
actress was destined to play the good girl. On "The Bold and the Beautiful," 
that would be Jessica Forrester. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward takes great delight in portraying Jessica, and "Bold and Beautiful" fans 
have welcomed her with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be playing a role model," says Ward. "I've gotten a lot of 
letters from people saying, 'You're a good role model for my granddaughter, or, 
you're a good role model for my daughter.' I've gotten mail from teen-age girls 
saying they wish they could be like Jessica. That makes me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially considering Ward is a novice to the world of show business. 
Although she longed to act since childhood -- "I acted out everything as a 
little girl and even started taking classes when I was 9" -- Ward didn't begin 
to pursue her dream, professionally, until she was 16. "Right after my braces 
came off," she says, flashing a perfect smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Destiny must have been on her side, because it only took Ward a year to turn 
her dream into reality. In fact, the role of Jessica Forrester was only her 
second professional audition. Her first was for "Saved By the Bell: The New 
Class." She vividly recalls her three "Bold and Beautiful" auditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I read for the role of Jessica was with casting director 
Christy Dooley," says Ward. "Then, I read opposite Ian Buchanan (James Warwick) 
for the show's producers. It was a Victoria Howard (Heather Tom) scene from 
"The Young and the Restless." I recognized it, because I watch the show 
occasionally. Ian played my father. 
</P>
<P>
 "The third time, I was supposed to screen test with Joshua Morrow," who plays 
Nick Newman on "The Young and the Restless" now, she continues. He was testing 
for the role of Dylan Shaw ("The Bold and the Beautiful"). (Dylan Neal, who 
ultimately landed the part, had been paired up with another actress.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, at the last minute, Dylan and I were told to switch partners. We did 
the scene together and both got the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's life suddenly changed. No longer was she preparing for her senior year 
of high school -- she was becoming a working actress. While she has made some 
adjustments in her life, the actress doesn't really mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still go to regular school on my days off," she says. "But when I'm 
working, I have a tutor that I study with at the studio. Sometimes I have to 
miss (school) events, because of work. But I really don't mind, because 
(acting) is what I really want to do. In the future I'll be glad I did 'The 
Bold and the Beautiful' instead of just hanging out while I was in high school. 
I still get to spend a lot of time with my friends on my days off." 
</P>
<P>
 Those days are spent going to the beach or shopping at the mall with my 
friends, says Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's favorite solo pastime, however, is photography. "I love taking 
pictures," she says. "I always bring my camera on ("Bold and Beautiful") 
location shoots. Then, I put all the pictures I take on a bulletin board in my 
dressing room." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bold and the Beautiful" airs weekdays at 12:30 p.m. on CBS.

OUT-OF-OFFICE EXPERIENCES; SETTING UP SHOP AT HOME

 You can pet the dog, hug your kid, listen to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony as 
loud as you want. Because you're in charge, master of the universe, the boss. 
Sound like a dream? To more than 43 million Americans working at home in 1994, 
it's the new reality. And roughly 66 million people -- or nearly half of the 
adult work force -- are expected to be doing the same, either full or part 
time, by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 A byproduct of the recession and corporate downsizing, the rise of the home 
office has also been fueled by technological innovation: Portable computers, 
fax machines, cellular phones and answering devices substitute for staff. "The 
technology allows individuals to be as productive from home as they are in 
their office," says Santa Monica radio personality Sarah Edwards, who 
co-authored the prescient "Working from Home" with her husband, Paul, nine 
years ago. "Today you can have a Fortune 500-equivalent office in your closet." 
Design-wise, the home office offers endless possibilities, from elaborate to 
makeshift, from Old World to contemporary. Some people make it the focal point 
of the house, while others transform laundry rooms and garages into work space. 
Still others, short on square footage, carve out hybrid rooms that can serve 
more than one function. But whatever it looks like, the home office is rapidly 
redefining the workplace, allowing more and more Californians to do business 
surrounded by high-tech equipment and their favorite things. FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest advantage of having a home office is the freedom it 
affords. Says Brentwood real estate agent Deborah Bremner, mother of two, with 
a third child due next month: "You can do all the work you normally do at the 
office at home, still be a family person and have a life." Bremner and her 
husband, James, also a real estate agent, set up their office in a central 
location, the spot they had originally planned as the dining room, in fact. 
They sit at a spacious "buddy desk," created by Los Angeles furniture designer 
Nick Berman with a teal-leather and sandblasted-glass top. A wall cabinet holds 
a shared desktop computer monitor (although she prefers using her laptop), TV, 
stereo and CD/ROM player. Each side of the desk has space for files and 
separate keyboards. "You might think it would be distracting, but at the Jon 
Douglas Co. in Brentwood, we work in a bullpen of 40 people. This is much 
quieter," Deborah says. And at night, the Bremners' 11-year-old, Ben, can do 
his homework at the round end of the desk, and the family dog, Piri, can curl 
up nearby. As James puts it: "Most people's lives revolve around the kitchen; 
in our home, all the activity is in the office." BEHIND THE BAR 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles furniture and interior designer Nick Berman closed his Santa 
Monica office last year to work out of his Inglewood factory and his Bel-Air 
house. "I never liked the impersonal space of a corporate office. Being at home 
is more comfortable," he says. And besides, the move enables clients to see his 
furniture in an actual home setting. Berman's new work space, fashioned out of 
a wet bar in a downstairs family room, provides peace and privacy, away from 
the rest of the house, as well as a spectacular view of the Pacific. The 
original space had been much smaller, but he extended the back bar five feet 
into the basement area under the house and raised the bar floor 12 inches to 
take advantage of the view. While the counter remains 42 inches high so that he 
and clients can look at fabric samples there, behind it are two 29-inch-high 
built-in desk and drawing areas. To store plans, catalogs and swatches, 
aniline-dyed shelves were added to a blank wall and a maple cabinet was 
stationed next to the fireplace. The best thing about working at home for 
Berman: "The freedom. If you're in a creative phase of a job, it allows you to 
go there anytime -- whenever inspiration calls." IN A BEDROOM 
</P>
<P>
 "In a house with four children, one dog, a staff of four and my mother, I 
sometimes need to escape," says Rebecka Belldegrun, president of Intertech 
Corp., an investmentcompany specializing in residential and commercial real 
estate and hotels. Belldegrun travels on business nearly half the year and 
balances busy social and home schedules with her husband, so she considers the 
beige-and-black bedroom office in her Brentwood ouse an oasis of calm. Designed 
by Beverly Hills architect Frank Israel, it features a massive 6-by-8-foot desk 
of bird's-eye maple wrapped in leather. A long exterior wall of windows was 
built to provide tranquil views of a large eucalyptus grove. On cold days, a 
free-standing fireplace-entertainment center glows with flames and seems to 
float in the middle of the room like a giant sculpture. And when Belldegrun 
wants to get away from it all, including work, she says, "I disconnect the 
phones." OUT OF A CLOSET 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles furniture designer Sally Sirkin Lewis, president and chief 
executive officer of the J. Robert Scott & Associates furniture and textile 
showroom in West Hollywood, created her home office from a 6-by-8-foot walk-in 
closet adjacent to her gym. Lewis removed the closet door and return walls, 
then enlarged the space by installing a mirror on the back wall and raising the 
ceiling to 10 feet. Finally, she added black-lacquer built-in shelves, files 
and a desk area. Lewis has designed interiors for the rich and famous for more 
than three decades, and her work frequently appears in Architectural Digest. 
"If the space is well-thought-out," she says, "you don't need that large a room 
for an office." A self-proclaimed workaholic whose main office is in Culver 
City, she works at home in Beverly Hills mornings, evenings and on weekends. "I 
like to do my textile design here because it's so quiet and free from 
interruptions," she says. And if she wants to get in a little exercise, Lewis 
has all the equipment just steps away. "I can do the treadmill and read reports 
at the same time, so I don't waste a minute." SOUTHWESTERN 
</P>
<P>
 Furniture designer Thomas Callaway's idyllic second-floor home office in 
Brentwood is nestled by giant sycamores and overlooks a waterfall that spills 
into a courtyard pool below. "The whole concept of the house office for me was 
to combine an early California rancho with some of the Taos artists' studios 
from the '30s and their kiva fireplaces and viga-style beams," he says. "I 
wanted to create a coziness and a sense of history that has appealed to me for 
many years." Callaway, who maintains a traditional business office and showroom 
for his collection of upholstered pieces, says the Santa Monica showroom is an 
open-space, group-oriented office with ringing phones and little privacy. "When 
I get home at night, I have this wonderful personal space surrounded by things 
that mean something to me. I find I do some of my best designs here." 
CONTINENTAL COUNTRY 
</P>
<P>
 Brindell Roberts, owner of The Blue House in Santa Monica and West Hollywood, 
specializes in continental country furnishings and accessories, so decorating 
her Holmby Hills office with the same blue-and-white English transferware, 
Chinese ginger jars and vintage baskets was a natural. An English bamboo 
armoire from the turn-ofthe-century stores bookkeeping supplies, a wicker 
basket contains files and a six-tiered Chinese box is used to organize stamps, 
rubber bands, note pads and pens. Using the office in the early morning and 
each evening, Roberts updates business records and mailing lists on the 
computer. "I can't get any paperwork done at the store," she says. "There's too 
much activity." The only downside about working at her Holmby Hills house: "My 
husband, Milton, sometimes has another agenda for me -- 'Call the exterminator, 
talk to the gardener ...' " MODERN 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Doug Ring, former president of the L.A. Public Library Commission, 
has offices in Marina del Rey and West Los Angeles, but the sleekly modern 
office at his house in Brentwood is his workplace of choice. Architect Tracey 
Loeb of Forma Architects in Santa Moncia designed the space, knowing that Ring 
needed a larger-than-average desk and wanted something made of granite. So the 
former sculptor created a three-piece, U-shaped desk of stainless steel topped 
with Ring's favorite stone. "The trick was to make something big that doesn't 
look like it consumes the space," Loeb says. Now Ring can spread out files at 
will: "I can be as comfortable as I want to be without offending anybody. It's 
100% my space." As a lawyer, he says, working at home makes sense. "If I'm 
doing research on Lexis, the legal database, whether I'm sitting at home or in 
the law library doesn't really matter to the client." VICTORIAN 
</P>
<P>
 Bryn Bridenthal, vice president of media and artist relations at Geffen 
Records, worked 12- to 16-hour days at the company's West Hollywood 
headquarters until she set up a home office. "I cut the time by being fully 
equipped at home. Here, I can at least have the illusion that I'm having a 
personal life," she says. Her office technology inclues a laptop computer with 
a modem to tie her into work, a fax, a printer and an electronic organizer 
which keeps track of her appointments, as well as several phone lines. Laid out 
by Bobi Leonard Interiors to do double duty as both home office and dining 
room, the space is furnished with an old oak table from her husband's family. 
When Bridenthal is in work mode, the table serves as her desk and a vintage 
armoire that belonged to her aunt holds office supplies. Turn-of-the-century 
reproduction Vienna art plates decorate the walls; a lawyer's cabinet to the 
right of the desk is filled with Russian lacquer boxes and antique silver. Says 
Bridenthal about her Mar Vista home office: "I like to have the things I love 
around me."

representative for Los Angeles-based fashion designer Richard Tyler.In front 
and out back, every scrap of ground around her 1930s bungalow is swathed in 
green or equipped for outdoor dining and loafing. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceived by Ashbrook as an L.A. version of European city gardens, it begins 
near the street with billows of drought-tolerant Korean grass ( Zoysia 
tenuifolia ), artemisia and blue fescue. From there, it slips behind a gate and 
runs along a sunny dining patio into the shade of an old Pittosporum undulatum 
tree. A renovated fountain is the focus of the back-yard glade, bedecked with 
urns, stone cherubs and other vintage gems. Venice garden artist Jay Griffith 
created a crazy rug of groundcovers, adding wild strawberry ( Fragaria 
chiloensis ), yarrow and wandering jew ( Tradescantia fluminensis ) to 
Ashbrook's carpet of baby's tears. He also pumped up the visual volume around a 
pool with massed society garlic ( Tulbaghia violacea ), dietes and papyrus. 
Pond specialist Don Hamburger of the Topanga-based company Aquasphere helped 
get the fountain going and supplied iris hybrids, cannas and miniature grasses 
and lilies, as well as goldfish and a turtle. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire rear garden takes advantage of the aquatic show. Within range of 
its sights and sounds, a sofa and chairs suggest a rustic living room, while a 
curving lounger, marooned in baby's tears, provides a solitary retreat. At the 
garden's other end, a covered terrace offers a different view and the comforts 
of a 1930s porch glider, the ultimate vehicle for relaxing after a stroll 
around the grounds.SUSAN HEEGER

RESTAURANTS; GO FISH; WITH ITS ODD SAUCES AND COMBINATIONS OF INGREDIENTS, THIS 
RESTAURANT IS ALL AT SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Just as a name like the Chop House conjures up images of juicy steaks and 
chops, the Fish House calls up visions of silvery salmon, massive swordfish and 
tuna, homely catfish, exotic escolar, piles of shellfish. The simple, solid 
name conveys a sense of tradition and class, which may be why the 
Portland-based McCormick & Schmick chose it for the chain's new Beverly Hills 
seafood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The address is Via Rodeo, an ersatz European-style hill town adjacent to Rodeo 
Drive. A pair of ivy topiary swordfish stands sentinel in front of the 
two-story restaurant. Garden tables and green-and-white rattan chairs dot the 
spacious cobblestoned courtyard. Directly in line with the entrance, cooks in 
snappy white jackets and very tall hats bend over their work in the 
stainless-steel kitchen. We're looking forward to a nice piece of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 We're seated in the courtyard, waiting for menus, for water, for wine. Our 
earnest and harried waiter, so overwhelmed by a few tables that we surmise it's 
his first night on the job, finally passes out tall menus printed with the 
day's date. The menu is dauntingly large, covering just about everything anyone 
could possibly do with seafood. Let's see, you could put it in tacos, 
sandwiches, salads, soups and pasta dishes. You could steam it, griddle it, 
pan-fry it, deep-fry it, bake it, sear it, roast it, grill it, saute it. Now 
we're the ones who are overwhelmed as we confront more than 100 choices. How 
can the kitchen possibly do all this well? The answer, as I soon find out, is 
that it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 My eye strays to the specialties first, but I can't persuade anyone to order 
"Canadian halibut oven roasted with Dungeness crab and Brie cheese." Small 
wonder. No takers for salmon with rhubarb chutney or swordfish with honey-yam 
butter either. And a definite pass on the grilled catfish sandwich with 
Canadian bacon and smoked Gouda.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I locate Lake Superior whitefish, pan-fried and topped with citrus 
beurre blanc . And since nobody else will, I order the shark tacos to start. I 
happen to love fish tacos, but not this one. Why bury juicy strips of shark in 
shredded raw cabbage and fold everything into a soft tortilla? Chipotle salsa 
might have been the saving grace, but it has seen better days. As the meal 
progresses, I begin to get the picture. The kitchen starts out with 
good-quality raw materials but undercuts its efforts with weird sauces and 
combinations of ingredients that don't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, though, they can't get the simplest things right. Deep-fried 
calamari is rubbery; crayfish cakes have so little flavor they could be 
anything at all; beer-battered lingcod is heavy and greasy, the chips limp. 
C'mon, the cooks should be able to make great fish and chips blindfolded. Raw 
oysters, which should be a sure bet, don't taste pristinely fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 The two best dishes this night are Atlantic king salmon baked on a cedar plank 
-- translucent at the center, a wonderful piece of fish if you ignore the 
raspberry sauce -- and the whitefish in citrus beurre blanc . Mexican scampi 
sauteed in garlic butter are fine, too, but the poor petrale sole is encased in 
Parmesan cheese and sadly overcooked. So is the butterflied trout. Deep-fried 
catfish in a cornmeal batter has a strong, funky taste, but the red beans 
served with it are good. Mushy semi di melone (melon-seed-shaped pasta) and a 
green vegetable accompany almost everything else, giving plates the 
unappetizing look of a retro TV dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Like McCormick & Schmick's in Downtown, Pasadena and Irvine, the Fish House is 
handsomely appointed. Here is a fortune in wood paneling and stained glass, all 
meticulously crafted in the Pacific Northwest. Booths are luxuriously ample, 
decorated with black-and-white photos of Beverly Hills in the '20s and '30s. 
Even half-filled, the room has the uninhabited feel of a hotel banquet room. 
There is life in the bar, where two TVs blare as happy hour winds to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 On another visit, I decide on a new strategy: ordering the plainest things. 
Clam chowder is from the wallpaper-paste school, thick enough to actually hold 
your spoon upright but short on chewy clams. Prawn cocktail features a nice 
rendition of classic horseradish-spiked cocktail sauce, but the prawns are 
tired. A bowl of dainty steamed Prince Edward Island mussels, tender and 
delicious, is not enhanced by basil pesto, nuts and all, stirred into the 
broth. 
</P>
<P>
 I did learn this: You can get a nice enough piece of fish at the Fish House if 
you choose your fish and tell them how you want it cooked. And request the 
sauce on the side. Who knows? The kitchen just might get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fish House, Two Rodeo, 206 N. Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills; (310) 859-0434. 
Dinner for two, food only, $20-$70. Smoking at tables in the outdoor courtyard 
and in the bar. Corkage, $10.

MUSIC & DANCE NEWS: MEET THE COMPOSER MULLS CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cariaga, Daniel Cariaga is The Times' music writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now celebrating its 20th anniversary, Meet the Composer has announced the 
latest re cipients in its Meet the Composer/Reader's Digest Commissioning 
Program. Grants totaling $511,000 have been allotted for new works to be 
commissioned by 107 U.S. arts organizations for performance in 57 cities in 28 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 These commissions are financed in partnership with the Lila Wallace-Reader's 
Digest Fund and the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, John Duffy, founder and president of Meet the Composer, 
acknowledged that, although these newest composer commissions are financed 
through the end of the fiscal year (June, 1995), after that projected cuts 
"probably in the area of 2%" may be instituted because of recent cutbacks in 
NEA funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand the need for fiscal restraint," Duffy told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is disturbing to the general art community is that these NEA cuts in 
funding are not being applied across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we wonder if some of them -- heavy cuts in grants to filmmakers, for 
instance, and to creators of new works in several fields -- have been made to 
placate Sen. (Jesse) Helms," the North Carolina Republican who is a longtime 
critic of governmental arts funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wonder if there are political motives behind this." 
</P>
<P>
 As of 1995, Duffy said, "the traditional partnership of public and private 
funding in our commissioning programs will have to be rethought. We are already 
engaged in looking seriously for new sources." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on the phone from New York City, Duffy also noted that some large 
contributors -- he mentioned Exxon by name -- "have stopped participating in 
programs funding new works, calling them 'elitist.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Among the West Coast recipients of the 1994 grants are L.A. Music Center Opera 
(for a one- act children's opera by Edward Barnes); UC Berkeley (for an opera 
project bringing together composer John Adams, librettist June Jordan and stage 
director Peter Sellars); the Pacific Symphony (a joint commission for three 
left-hand piano concertos from composer William Bolcom); Los Angeles Chamber 
Orchestra (a double concerto for violin and guitar by Aaron Jay Kernis); UCLA 
Gamelan (a new electronic/acoustic piece from Elaine Barkin); California EAR 
Unit (a work by Mel Powell) and the Los Angeles Philharmonic (a 20-minute piece 
for small ensemble by Chen Yi). 
</P>
<P>
 BALLET IN THE BLACK: At San Francisco Ballet, now noting the 50th anniversary 
of its groundbreaking "Nutcracker" production in 1944, fiscal concerns steal 
the thunder of artistic ones: According to Executive Director Arthur Jacobus 
and Chairman of the Board Chris Hellman, the company has reduced its 
accumulated operating deficit by $230, 574. 
</P>
<P>
 At the ballet's annual meeting, Jacobus and Hellman announced that the company 
ended its third consecutive year in the black. Total revenues for 1993-4, 
including box-office receipts, government grants and other fund raising, is 
$15,972,867. The deficit reduction noted above has now brought the company's 
accumulated operating deficit down to $2,984,000. 
</P>
<P>
 During the season, it danced 115 performances in San Francisco and Washington 
for nearly 251,000 people. In addition, more than 11,000 dance-watchers, many 
of them students, were reached the the company's Community Outreach programs, 
which included five student matinees. 
</P>
<P>
 BRIEFLY: In collaboration with the Romola and Vaslav Nijinsky Foundation, the 
Severin Wunderman Museum in Irvine will present "Vaslav Nijinsky: Art of the 
World's Greatest Dancer," a collection of paintings, drawings, costumes, 
lithographs, serigraphs, photographs and personal effects, Monday through Feb. 
7. . . . KUSC-FM is broadcasting concerts of the Long Beach Symphony this 
season. The first concert was aired Oct. 28; remaining broadcasts are scheduled 
for Dec. 9, Feb. 10, April 28 and June 9. . . . Halloween entertainment at the 
Donovan Correctional Facility at Otay Mesa in San Diego County was provided by 
the seven-member San Diego Opera Ensemble, led by musical director/pianist 
Catherine Miller. More than 100 of t/he state prison's 4,500 inmates were 
serenaded by music from American operatic works by Carlisle Floyd, Copland, 
Gershwin and Weill, among others. . . . Dance historian and former Balanchine 
dancer Nancy Reynolds has established a $1.75-million endowment for the George 
Balanchine Foundation. To be called the Nancy Remick Reynolds Endowment of the 
Balanchine Foundation, the fund will be used as seed money for a program of 
"research, documentation and educational publishing," including digital 
preservation and the creation of multimedia presentations on CD-ROM. Reynolds 
will serve as director of research.*

 THE EAGLES, "Hell Freezes Over" ( Geffen )*** 
</P>
<P>
 Some bands would be insulted by the term "hitmaking machine" because it 
suggests a lack of passion, but it's a tribute to the character and craft of 
the Eagles how easily they've returned to hitmaking form after a 14-year break. 
</P>
<P>
 Already in the national Top 40, "Get Over It" is a snarling, high-energy slap 
by Don Henley and Glenn Frey at '90s political correctness -- one of four 
studio tracks on this otherwise live reunion collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Girl From Yesterday," written by Frey and Jack Tempchin, showcases the 
melancholy country side of the band, while "Love Will Keep Us Alive," a 
non-Eagles composition, overcomes the conventional lyrics with the sweet 
romanticism of Timothy B. Schmit's vocal. Best of all is Henley-Frey's "Learn 
to Be Still," which carries much of the soft, philosophical resonance of "The 
Last Resort." 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 11 tracks, ranging from 1972's "Take It Easy" to Henley's 
post-Eagles "New York Minute," were recorded from an MTV special last spring in 
Burbank -- and they, too, are so still seductive we'll probably be hearing most 
of them on the radio for months. What was it the Eagles said about the long 
run? 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four (excellent).

RECORD RACK: 'WOODSTOCK' A MUSICAL QUAGMIRE

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 VARIOUS ARTISTS, "Woodstock '94" ( A&M ) * 
</P>
<P>
 One reason people began covering themselves with mud at Woodstock '94 was that 
they were looking for something to do in the hours when there wasn't much 
interesting happening on stage. There was, indeed, so little compelling, 
contemporary vision in the music that the sonic highlights of the three-day 
festival could fit comfortably on a pair of 90-minute cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
 We're speaking of imaginary cassettes that would basically be the entire sets 
of Nine Inch Nails and Metallica, plus selected numbers each from the best of 
the remaining attractions, from Bob Dylan and James to the Rollins Band and 
Green Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the record company was limited by contract to one song per act. 
That means the bulk of this two-disc package is devoted to largely irrelevant 
veteran acts (including Joe Cocker, Traffic and Paul Rodgers), insignificant 
new ones (including Blues Traveler, Blind Melon and Primus) and extended 
versions of overly familiar songs (including eight more minutes of Peter 
Gabriel's "Biko"). On top of that, they didn't even pick the best Nine Inch 
Nails song. Mud, anyone?

POP EYE: LOSING THEIR AVERSION TO ARENAS; R.E.M.'S FIRST TOUR IN NEARLY SIX 
YEARS WILL PROBABLY HIT THE FORUM, POND AND BLOCKBUSTER PAVILION IN THE SPRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 R.E.M. fans know that the band wasn't exactly thrilled about playing big 
arenas on its last tour, in 1989. The intimacy and character of the Georgia 
rockers' music was often lost in the cavernous settings -- which is one reason 
the group has taken nearly six years off from live shows. 
</P>
<P>
 So now that R.E.M. is returning to the road, guess where they'll be playing in 
the U.S. Big arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California dates are being held in May at the Forum in Inglewood and 
the Pond of Anaheim, each seating more than 16,000, and at the Blockbuster 
Pavilion in Devore, with a potential capacity of more than 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally am not looking forward to seeing them in an arena again, but 
there really doesn't seem to be an alternative," says Denise Sullivan, author 
of a new book about R.E.M., "Talk About the Passion: An Oral History." 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Williams, the group's concert booking agent, says that there is in fact 
an alternative, but it's an even less appealing one. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could play stadiums ," says Williams. "They've now got a huge amount of 
fans who want to see them, and they have to go to arenas just to accommodate 
the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Anything smaller, says Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert trade magazine 
Pollstar, is just unrealistic.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'd all love to see the Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd or R.E.M. in a small 
theater or club, but the economic reality is that it wouldn't work," he says. 
"I suppose we should be thankful that (road-shy singer) Michael Stipe is 
agreeing to do a tour at all, and I certainly don't think the band wants to 
stay on the road for the next five years to satisfy the demand there would be 
if they played small theaters." 
</P>
<P>
 How will this set with R.E.M. loyalists? 
</P>

 Megan McLaughlin, editor of the college and alternative rock trade weekly CMJ, 
says that only the band's longest-term fans, who may have seen the group in 
small clubs a decade ago, won't be happy. The more recent fans, especially 
those who have never seen the band perform, she says, will get swept up in the 
magnitude of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of young fans -- and adults, too -- who only go to big 
shows," she says. "There won't be too many people sitting there saying, 'I saw 
R.E.M. back when there were only 50 people.' " Steve Hochman

 ON THE ROAD: R.E.M. and Neil Young aren't the only reasons concert promoters 
are looking eagerly to 1995's prospects. Though this year's lineup will be hard 
to top -- Barbra Streisand, the Eagles, the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd 
helping to ring up record ticket sales -- next year's expected road warriors 
are no slouches. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the way is the expected "Unledded" tour reuniting Led Zeppelin's Jimmy 
Page and Robert Plant, likely mixing stops at arenas and large amphitheaters 
with some stadium dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Other names that have promoters salivating include Van Halen (another stadium 
candidate, with a new album due in January), Elton John and perennial 
top-sellers Jimmy Buffett and the Grateful Dead. Pearl Jam's expected tour is 
also tantalizing the concert world, though it comes with some question marks, 
given the band's desire to stay away from conventional concert venues in favor 
of "alternative" sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The other big question marks concern two acts that were long dominant in the 
concert world but have been absent in recent years: Bon Jovi and Bob Seger.

 BEATLES FOR SALE: When Capitol-EMI first released Beatles recordings in the 
early '60s, there was plenty of doubt about the group's long-range sales 
potential. Thirty years later, there can be no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Or can there? 
</P>
<P>
 Beatles enthusiasts are already warming up their credit cards for Capitol's 
release next month of a two-CD collection of the Fab Four's in-studio live 
recordings for BBC radio -- the first "new" Beatles record since 1980's 
"Rarities." But will the average rock fan care? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wildly unpredictable," says Pete Howard, editor of the monthly CD 
newsletter ICE. "I don't think this will create new Beatles fans . . . though 
holiday shopping will help it. Giving a gift of the Beatles is safe not just 
among baby boomers, but all ages." 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Nast, senior vice president of the radio and retail trade magazine Album 
Network, agrees that this could be a big test of how the Beatles' popularity 
translates in the grunge era. "I can't wait to see how the Beatles hold up in 
the midst of new albums by Pearl Jam and the Black Crowes and other new groups. 
But how could you ever bet against the Beatles?" Steve Hochman

 ENGLAND SWINGS: Rumors that Morrissey had committed suicide swept the British 
music world in recent weeks -- even the staid BBC called music weekly Melody 
Maker to check out the buzz. The "news" proved quite false, though Morrissey's 
British press officer, Murray Chalmers, was forced to make a statement to stop 
the talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got loads and loads of calls," Chalmers said. "It was amazing how fast the 
rumor spread. I think it must have been started by someone in Scotland, because 
the story was that it had happened there. But in fact, as I told everyone, he 
was on a train from Manchester to London that afternoon, and he hasn't been to 
Scotland for ages. Don't worry -- he's alive and well."

 * Shane MacGowan has been censured by the Irish Advertising Standards 
Authority over a poster campaign for his new single, "The Church of the Holy 
Spook," which it ruled "insensitive and offensive." The poster, like the 
single's cover, features a 4-year-old photo of the former Pogues singer, 
bearded and shirtless, striking a Crucifixion pose, his arm outstretched along 
a wooden crossbar and his head lolling to one side. Warner Music Ireland 
officials argued that the young people in MacGowan's market would understand 
that the photo was not meant to offend, but the Authority ruled that the poster 
was not acceptable under Irish advertising standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Manchester-based Factory Records, best known as the original home of Joy 
Division and New Order, is being re-launched after battling financial problems. 
The new venture, re-christened Factory Too, is set to bow with a new album by 
the veteran band Durutti Column on Nov. 14. Dave Jennings, from London

 AND ONE MORE THING: Bobby Sherman -- yes, that Bobby Sherman -- is recording 
again.But instead of teeny-bopper squeals, the ex-poster boy is hoping to raise 
bucks for the LAPD's Reserve Officer Training Fund. The former teen idol, who 
is now an LAPD paramedic and first aid instructor, is working on a song and 
video titled "The Thin Blue Line," about being a cop in the line of fire. 
Sherman's "Greatest Hits" and "Christmas" albums, by the way, are still steady 
sellers through L.A.-based Restless Records.*

 STAN GETZ, "Nobody Else but Me" ( Verve Records ) *** 1/2  
</P>
<P>
 Recorded in 1964, when Stan Getz's bossa nova playing had suddenly propelled 
him into commercial popularity, this set of tunes from his touring group of the 
time was never released. Apparently reluctant to risk undercutting the 
saxophonist's chart-topping success with jazz samba, Verve withheld an album 
that, ironically, contains some of Getz's most pure, straight-ahead jazz 
improvisations. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of Gary Burton's vibes as the quartet's harmonic instrument 
provides an unusually translucent musical environment for Getz's soloing, 
especially on ballads. Always a soaringly lyrical artist, Getz outdoes himself 
here, playing standards such as "Here's That Rainy Day" and "Little Girl Blue" 
with an almost achingly poignant touch. In the background, Burton's soft, 
unobtrusive chords float gently in space, quietly supporting Getz's gorgeous 
high notes with an airy textural blend that could never have been supplied by a 
piano. 
</P>
<P>
 But Getz's real purpose with this group was to maintain his jazz chops at a 
time when the siren call of bossa nova was demanding much of his attention. And 
on several tracks he does so with a vengeance. His chorus on "Out of Focus" is 
a driving, multi-metric rush, highlighted by passionately intense upper 
harmonic cries, and the way he digs into the Jerome Kern title tune confirms 
Getz's often under-appreciated ability to swing, and swing hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, there is an up-tempo romp through "What Is This Thing Called 
Love?" that surely is one of Getz's finest performances -- a brilliant 
demonstration of the incredible generative force of an improvising musician at 
the peak of his powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his stellar harmonic work, Burton, only 21 at the time, plays with 
an impressively mature touch, and bassist Gene Cherico and drummer Joe Hunt lay 
down the steady, low-profile flow that Getz insisted upon in his rhythm 
sections. Don Heckman

 Zhang Yimou's 1991 Oscar-nominated film of astonishing beauty and terror has 
the impact of Greek tragedy. The director takes us into the cloistered 
household of a middle-aged Northern Chinese nobleman in the 1920s.A pretty, 
confident but fatally naive 19-year-old (Gong Li, left) has agreed to his No. 4 
wife (Cao Cuifeng, right, portrays the No. 2 wife). Nothing prepares us fully 
for this calmly shattering film. Set in a totally treacherous household, this 
film is about as harrowing a portrait of the systematic oppressin of women as 
imaginable. Every frame of "Raise the Red Lantern" is expressive of the 
incredibly narrow lives of its women and of the No. 4 wife in particular 
(Cinemax Monday at 6:20 a.m.).

 With his impish grin and the personality of a sardonic Ichabod Crane, James 
Carville (pictured), Bill Clinton's preeminent campaign strategist, is a 
natural actor. And this 1993 D.A. Pennebaker-Chris Hegedus documentary gives 
him the starring role he thoroughly deserved.Carville shares screen time with 
George Stephanopoulos, Clinton's director of communications at the time. As the 
Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside of the Arkansas governor's presidential campaign, 
they light up Clinton's drive to the White House and turn this film into a 
tiptop political documentary. The film is most notable for offering a candid 
and entertaining backstage look at a most unlikely electoral juggernaut (Disney 
Channel, Sunday at 9 p.m., Monday at 3:30 a.m., Saturday at 11 p.m.). Kenneth

 This 1993 blockbuster is a safe and sane entertainment where all the 
characters are nice and all the situations unadventurous.Robin Williams (left) 
takes on a role born in high-concept heaven: a divorced dad and unemployed 
voice-over actor who disguises himself as a grandmotherly British housekeeper 
to spend more time with the children he loves. (Sally Field, pictured, is his 
ex-wife, a high-powered interior decorator.) Gradually but undeniably, Williams 
is going soft and mushy, and it is not a pleasing sight (HBO Tuesday at 9 a.m. 
and 8 p.m.; Friday at 11 a.m. and 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

 About as hard to resist -- and as intellectually demanding -- as an 
affectionate puppy, this 1993 release is one of those Never Say Die, I Gotta Be 
Me, Somebody Up There Likes Me sports movies that no amount of cynicism can 
diminish. Daniel E. (Rudy) Ruettiger's football story tells of a lad who strove 
mightily against the odds for years of his life just on the off chance that one 
day at Notre Dame, no less, he might be allowed to suit up, walk onto the field 
and be a bench warmer.Described as a "5-foot-nothing, 100 and nothing, with 
hardly a spec of athletic ability," Rudy (Sean Astin, pictured) nevertheless 
persists. As convincingly played by Astin, Rudy is more than just persistent, 
he is equal parts likable and unaffected. In fact, Astin's engaging performance 
is the best thing about the film (HBO Saturday at 7 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

RETRO; OLD 'DOG,' NEW TRICKS

 Tubs, one of the stars of "The Shaggy Dog," is sitting behind the driver's 
seat of an old hot rod posing for publicity photos. But the shoot isn't going 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old English sheep dog doesn't mean to be difficult. It's just that his big 
hairy paws keep slipping off the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Joe Camp walks over and puts the paws of the good-natured Tubs back on 
the wheel, and the photographer continues. When the session ends, Tubs relaxes 
in the shade with a huge bowl of fresh water. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have certain limitations," Camp says of the breed. "They don't see as 
well (as other dogs) because of all of the hair in their eyes. Same thing with 
all the hair over their ears. They don't hear as well. So a lot of times you 
are doing a lot of shouting and waving to get their attention, which makes it 
real difficult for the actors. Everybody has kind of put them down as being not 
the brightest dogs, but as working dogs they do pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the breed that made a big splash in its 1965-67 "Please Don't Eat the 
Daisies" TV run (who can forget Ladadog?) is definitely working again in 
Hollywood. A remake of Disney's "The Shaggy Dog" premieres Saturday on "The ABC 
Family Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 The classic 1959 film, about a teen-age boy who becomes a sheep dog thanks to 
an ancient spell, stars Tommy Kirk, Fred MacMurray, Annette Funicello and Kevin 
Corcoran. The new version stars Scott Weinger ("Full House") as 16-year-old 
science whiz Wilby Daniels, Ed Begley Jr. as his father, Sharon Lawrence as his 
mother, and Natasha Gregson Wagner as the girl next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Four dogs -- Tubs, Rufus, his father Hastings and Josh -- all play the title 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we were going to go for a very traditional approach to this and 
keep some of that small-town America (that was in the original),' says 
executive producer George Zaloom. "We kept the same type of car. We kept the 
idea of the back lot. The Disney back lot is gone, but we shot it up on 
Colonial Street at Universal Studios." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone, though, is the outdated Cold War subplot from the original. "The entire 
spy subplot doesn't really work today because there is no such thing as the 
Soviet Union," Zaloom says. This time around, Wilby, the dog, overhears a plot 
for a jewel heist and Wilby, the human, tries to save the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The special effects in the ABC film are far more sophisticated than they were 
35 years ago, especially scenes in which Wilby transforms into the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days there were a bunch of cheesy dissolves," Zaloom explains. "It 
looked like a werewolf. Now we can use computerized morphs. I think they'll 
look pretty good because we are spending a lot of money. And the same thing 
with the talking dog. We really developed this great talking-dog head. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping to get a real talking dog but we couldn't afford that," Zaloom 
adds, laughing. "They eat a lot of dog food!" 
</P>
<P>
 Weinger had to endure several hours in the makeup chair to become a dog. "They 
apply each section of hair one piece at a time," he says with a moan. "You have 
to do it to your arms and your face and your ears. And then they have to glue 
strips of latex to your face and your nose and stuff. We did it until 5 in the 
morning one Friday night." 
</P>
<P>
 The young actor pauses and smiles: "But that's the thing an artist does when 
he is really dedicated to his work!" 
</P>
<P>
 Camp spent seven weeks training the dogs. "For the amount of work we are 
doing, that is plenty of time," Camp says. "With the talking heads and 
different suits as good as they are today, they have taken a lot of pressure 
off of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs, he says, can duplicate one another's tricks. "In case one gets 
tired, he can also take over and do some of the behaviors," Camp says. "Some of 
the dogs are more adept at certain things. Rufus and Tubs do most of the work, 
with Rufus, a young 1 1/2-year-old dog, doing most of the stress and strain 
kind of things, running and jumping. Tubs is a veteran and has more of a stage 
presence." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal of these shaggy dogs, Camp believes, lies in the fact that they 
"have a certain comicality about them. They look like they are people in baggy, 
shaggy pants when they walk. The dogs are very gentle dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Shaggy Dog" premieres Saturday at 8 p.m. on ABC.

<P>
 Regarding Sheryl Garratt's article "The Madonna Complex" (Oct. 23): 
</P>
<P>
 I thoroughly enjoyed the interview with Madonna, although I personally believe 
that bad-mouthing Madonna is the tired subject, not the superstar herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna was passed off as a "one-hit wonder" during the time of "Like a 
Virgin," and 10 years later she's still here. Throughout her career Madonna has 
always been questioned and has always answered with confidence and class. The 
idea that her career is in turmoil is ridiculous. Madonna is currently enjoying 
the success of her 27th Top 10 single, "Secret," a feat no other female singer 
or Michael Jackson or Prince has reached. It seems that expectations of Madonna 
have been higher than for any other artist, dead or alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's more convenient to talk about the "scandal" and rumored 
personal life of Madonna, rather than to praise her for the many achievements 
she has made or the millions of dollars she has given to charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is that the public and critics expect perfection from Madonna. 
And if she doesn't deliver, she's considered a failure. Everyone must realize 
that Madonna sings and dances. She doesn't walk on water. 
</P>

<P>
 Madonna's career is over. Gee , where have I heard that before? I think the 
first time was with the release of her second album many, many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When will the critics give up and just accept that she is the artist of our 
times and concentrate on her art ? Having a best-selling book, albums that 
spend weeks on the Billboard charts, her best acting to date in "A League of 
Their Own," breaking and exploring cultural taboos, helping fight AIDS and 
promoting women's rights -- these are hardly the signs of an artist in decline. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad that in art history, we remember the artists -- and not the critics. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Madonna makes the illicit correlation commonly used by celebrities in their 
reflections on publicity injustices: Artistic vision is synonymous with 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna feels that her artistic potential is always undermined by the 
ignorance of those interpreting it. Her cinematic colleagues continually 
double-cross her; her contemporaries deny their debt to her; the press twists 
her personal life into a sordid fantasy that no one could want, no matter how 
uninhibited (I'll buy that one -- leave the woman alone). 
</P>
<P>
 I enjoy her subverting the self-righteous, puritanical fear that America seems 
to harbor toward healthy sex. I also suggest that the tremendous power and 
wealth that Madonna has amassed is rooted much more firmly in sex appeal than 
in artistic vision or cultural insight. Madonna seems to have a keen 
appreciation of art, but on this count, I would say she is more of an informed 
admirer than a maverick participant. 
</P>
<P>
 I would go to a Madonna show or movie for fun, not intellectual or cultural 
enlightenment. Until she realizes that her contributions thus far have been 
somewhat limited to playful entertainment, I'm afraid she can expect more 
frustration in the future.

 Get a grip, Madonna, you're not being punished, you're being ignored. That is 
what happens when you go for the short, cheap shots. Let's put it this way: 
We've all been fooled by lust. It feels good for a while, and on some occasions 
it may even turn into love. In your case, it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Lust grabs one by the crotch and goes straight to the pleasure center where it 
can survive for a short time. Love, on the other hand, goes to the heart and 
stays longer. It's a fundamental thing, Madonna, sort of the difference between 
going to the bachelor party and going to the wedding. It was a great party; let 
it go at that. You just aren't marriage material, metaphorically speaking, that 
is.

<P>
 Does the name Marie Antoinette mean anything to Madonna?  
</P>
<P>
 She's no "mother of the younger generation" who has made the way for younger 
people who now want to get rid of her in order to gain their independence from 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Harry is older, and I believe that more younger people identify with 
her than with Madonna. She's got more of Marilyn Monroe in her finger than 
Madonna has in her whole body. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna for years was able to get more attention than anybody, at the very 
serious and high cost to many; in the previous decade, dominated by women of 
substance such as Patti Smith and Harry, she never would have gotten such 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Her monumental ego disturbs and angers me. She's as detached from reality as 
anyone I can even imagine (even more than I thought she was). People have good 
reason to be bored by her -- she is boring.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Rotten said it best of all: "We're pretty, pretty vacant, and we don't 
care." 
</P>

<P>
 So Madonna bemoans the fact that women in the public eye aren't allowed to 
age. I agree. But then why aren't there any recent untouched photos of her 
published with this fawning article, which states that she is very pretty with 
minimal makeup and has fewer lines on her face than most in their 30s? 
</P>
<P>
 Sound catty? Hey, this is Madonna we're talking about. Her self-promotion is 
legendary. She's a product of her time, the Reagan era, where the end justifies 
the means. 
</P>
<P>
 So some women don't want to credit Madonna for their success. What Madonna 
promotes is Madonna, and it's just too late to believe that her goal is to 
raise our social consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Is she successful in a man's world? Yes. Is she lauded for her outspokenness? 
Yes. But what does she speak about? Madonna, Madonna and more Madonna. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Contrary to Madonna's complaints, other artists have spoken positively of her 
and her influence. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked, "What do you owe to Madonna?" Liz Phair answered (in the July 
issue of Details): "A lot. I think she kicked a huge rough-hewn path through 
the jungle and we're all tiptoeing behind her saying, 'Look at the pretty 
flowers.' Madonna made it possible for me to be interpreted correctly."

MURDER ON THE MIDWAY: SORDID LIFE AND DEATH OF LOBSTER BOY; CRIME: FAMILY 
SUPPORTS WIFE'S CLAIMS OF FAMILIAL ABUSE, CITING INCIDENT IN WHICH CARNIVAL 
ATTRACTION KILLED DAUGHTER'S BEAU. 
</P>

<P>
 His destiny was clear from the moment he emerged from the womb with pincerlike 
hands and flipper legs. 
</P>
<P>
 As the fourth generation of his family born with the deformities, and the son 
of the 1930s sideshow performer Lobster Man, it was only natural when a smiling 
Grady Stiles Jr. took the stage as Lobster Boy at age 7. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly half a century, he traveled from town to town on the carnival 
circuit, hoisting himself atop a cushioned platform in a sweltering tent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, I am the Lobster Boy," he would say. 
"This condition is not caused by drugs or diseases. It runs in the family." 
</P>
<P>
 As the boy grew into a bald, barrel-chested man, he remained seemingly unfazed 
by the stares and the jeers and the taunts. It was the only life Stiles ever 
knew. 
</P>
<P>
 And this was all the public would know of him until a cold November night two 
years ago when his wife arranged to have him killed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a case of kill or be killed, she said, the only way to put an end to 
his drunken beatings and threats, to protect herself and her daughter and 
stepson, both born with the same deformities. 
</P>
<P>
 So one night while Lobster Boy watched television in their trailer in 
Gibsonton, a ragged community south of Tampa for an aging collection of 
carnival folk, his wife slipped out for a quick visit with relatives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hurry back," Stiles called to her, sitting there in his underwear, drinking a 
glass of iced tea. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, a hit man who had been paid $1,500 crept out of a back room where 
he had been hiding and fired two .32-caliber bullets into the 55-year-old 
carnival attraction's brain. 
</P>
<P>
 He was buried in a showman's cemetery. A bouquet of flowers adorned his coffin 
with a banner: "From your loving wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Teresa Stiles, 56, was sentenced on Aug. 29 to 12 years in prison for 
manslaughter. She was later freed on bond while she appeals her case. 
</P>
<P>
 She is still puzzled that jurors didn't fully buy her argument that she was 
battered by a powerfully built, bottle-a-day drunk who vented his rage on the 
whole family. She said she had no alternative but to have him killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband was going to kill my family -- I believe that from the bottom of 
my heart," she told the judge through tears at her sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this close-knit community of present and former carnival workers, which 
clings to the moniker "Showtown U.S.A.," there is little sympathy for Stiles' 
widow. 
</P>
<P>
 Many knew and respected Lobster Boy. They remember him as a smart businessman 
who went from working in multi-freak caravans to owning his own shows. When 
people were down on their luck, he would lend them money. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he was often disagreeable and drank to excess -- Seagrams 7 doubles 
with a splash of Coke -- most carnies agreed with prosecutors, who called the 
slaying a murder of convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "All she had to do was walk away," said Jeanie Tomaini, 77, a white-haired 
woman with wire-rimmed glasses who was once billed as "The World's Oldest 
Living Half-Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any legs or much of anything going for me," Tomaini said, "but 
if anybody gives me a hard time, you better know I'll be out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomaini, who is 2-foot-6, was born without legs and performed with her late 
husband Al, 8-foot-4, before she retired in 1949. Now she sells bait at her 
Giants Fish Camp on the nearby Alafia River. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Murray, a former sideshow barker, said Mary Stiles went about it the 
wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would have stood a better chance had she turned around and killed him 
herself," Murray said. "People can at least relate to that." 
</P>
<P>
 To find anyone who supports Mary Stiles, you have to go to the trailer where 
the slaying took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Lobster Boy's children, Cathy Stiles, 25, and Grady Stiles III, 18, 
can't say enough bad things about the father who sometimes pulled them on stage 
to show how they inherited the lobster claw syndrome that's been in the family 
since the 1840s. 
</P>
<P>
 The syndrome is known medically as ectrodactyly. The middle digits on the foot 
and hand are missing and the remaining ones fuse into two parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy describes her father as "Satan himself." She said he refused to allow 
them to venture out on the carnival midways unless they wore large leather 
gloves so that carnival-goers -- "marks" -- wouldn't get a free peek at their 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy said that a few years ago, when she was seven months pregnant, her 
drunken father knocked her out of her wheelchair when she tried to stop him 
from swatting her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning she was rushed to the hospital for an emergency Cesarean 
section. Her daughter, Misty, now 4, was born prematurely. She has the same 
lobster-claw deformities. The sixth generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Teresa Stiles claims that at age 19 she ran away from an abusive home to 
join the carnival. She and Stiles were married in 1958 and had two children. 
One, Donna, had no deformities. The other was Cathy, the fifth generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few years into the marriage, Mary Stiles said, whiskey transformed her 
husband from a caring family man into a battering brute. The marriage ended in 
1973 and Mary Stiles married Harry Glenn Newman, a midget known on the carnival 
circuit as the "World's Smallest Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Stiles took the children and moved to his hometown of Pittsburgh, where he 
married a woman named Barbara and had his namesake, Grady Stiles III. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, his oldest daughter, Donna, then 17, ran away with a boyfriend and 
announced they had to get married because she was pregnant. This was a lie. 
Nonetheless, her father summoned his future son-in-law "for a private talk." 
When he arrived, said Donna, her father blew him away with two shotgun blasts 
and he died in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was just sitting up on the porch smiling," Donna recalled. "He said, 
'I told you I would kill him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stiles was convicted of third-degree murder in 1979. He was sentenced to 15 
years' probation, partly because of his deformities and because he had 
cirrhosis from heavy drinking and emphysema from smoking three packs of 
cigarettes a day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mary Stiles says her love for Lobster Boy drove her back into his arms. 
They remarried in 1989 after he divorced his second wife and assured her his 
drinking days were over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two weeks later," she said, "he was back to the same old Grady." 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, the family still ventured out on the road with their freak 
show. They had a "Ten-in-One" performance featuring a Human Pincushion, a Human 
Blockhead, Burmese Pythons, a gorilla lady illusion act and a sideshow of 
animal oddities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main attraction remained the Lobster Boy, in his yellow-and-white tent 
draped with banners. One showed the star underwater catching fish with his 
claws. Another depicted his mother's horrified reaction to his birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of his life, family members said, Stiles, would be drunk on 
stage and would lunge at the marks to scare them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Stiles said he sexually abused her, tried to smother her with a pillow, 
and one morning awoke her with whiskey breath and a butcher knife to her 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'One of these days I'm going to kill you and your family,' " she quoted him 
as saying. She says he then dropped the knife and crawled away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something had to be done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She turned to her oldest teen-age son, Harry Glenn Newman III, the product of 
her marriage to the midget. The boy was normal-size, round-faced and pudgy. He 
had an IQ of 79. In the family sideshow, he became the Human Blockhead. His 
talent was driving nails into his nostrils. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother gave him money to hire a killer. Newman selected a classmate, 
Christopher Wyant, said to have gang ties. Wyant, now 19, was convicted of 
second-degree murder and sentenced to 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, 20, fared worse. At his trial he claimed he joined the plot only to 
protect his mother. The jury took about an hour to convict him of first-degree 
murder. On Oct. 14 he was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of 
parole for at least 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Stiles and her half-brother, Grady, survive on government disability 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Gibsonton, the tents and trailers from the family's sideshow are up 
for sale.

CAGED ANIMALS TRAINED FOR RETURN TO THE WILD; WILDLIFE: COLOMBIAN CENTER TAKES 
IN ANIMALS SEIZED FROM SMUGGLERS AND TRIES TO SHOW THEM HOW TO FEND FOR 
THEMSELVES. PROGRAM IS FUNDED BY LONDON-BASED WORLD SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION 
OF ANIMALS.

<P>
 Alerted by the flapping of wings, the jungle cat spotted its prey and pounced. 
</P>
<P>
 A swipe of a furry, clawed paw across the neck and the bird was dead. The 
margay, a small tiger-like cat native to Latin America, clamped the game hen in 
its jaws and padded deeper into its cage. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's learning well," naturalist Fernando Londono said as the margay deftly 
ripped away feathers and sank fangs into hot flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 The margay is an honor student at a center run by the London-based World 
Society for the Protection of Animals that trains animals to return to the 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals come from lawmen who raid gangs involved in the illicit trade of 
live wild animals. It has become a $10-billion-a-year business worldwide -- 
third only to the trafficking of drugs and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffickers can buy a macaw for $100 in South America and sell it for up to 
$6,000 in North America or Europe. Animals are often shipped under appalling 
conditions. Parrots are jammed into suitcases and crates, their beaks and wings 
bound. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals that wind up in the society's Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, set 
amid Andean grasslands on the outskirts of Bogota, have a chance at living in 
the wild again. 
</P>
<P>
 The margay, called a tigrillo -- little tiger -- in Spanish, is learning to 
fend for itself so rapidly that workers plan to release it into the jungle 
within a few months. The rehabilitation center, one of a handful in the world, 
has returned hundreds of animals to the wild since it opened three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the procedure is risky. Besides the threat of predators or accidents, 
released animals can endanger their species if they have a disease alien to the 
local population. 
</P>
<P>
 Society officials don't know the survival rate because released animals are 
not tracked by radio transmitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturalist Bill Toone, who helped direct the attempt to return endangered 
California condors to the wild, is critical of naturalists who try to release 
numerous species. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing they've done is make themselves feel better, because the 
animals are dying where they can't see them," Toone said in a telephone 
interview from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that despite having focused intensively on only one species, the 
condor program has been "an absolute failure." Released condors have died 
crashing into power lines or ingesting antifreeze and other poisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Toone believes centers that release many species with less study are toying 
with nature, with unforeseen consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you put animals into the wild, you don't know what you've done," Toone 
said. "It's like AIDS, a web of trouble that can go with it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jean Patrick Le Duc, spokesman for the U.N. Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species, applauds the Colombian program. The convention, 
which seeks to halt trade in endangered wild species, has been adopted by 122 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police are reluctant to confiscate animals because they don't know what to do 
with them," Le Duc said in a phone interview from Geneva. "But if they have a 
center like the one in Bogota to turn to, they're more likely to confiscate 
animals, and that helps us enforce the convention." 
</P>
<P>
 Animals brought to the society's rehabilitation center are taken to its clinic 
for blood and fecal tests and X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day, a newly arrived owl was the subject of veterinarian Fernando 
Nassar's exam. 
</P>
<P>
 The owl, whose brown wings laced with white dots extend to almost three feet, 
had a hood over its head to calm it. Still, it plunged its talons into a thick 
leather glove on Nassar's hand as he probed for broken bones and other 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at the center are honing another owl's hunting instincts by releasing 
mice into its cage through a tube from behind a screen of bushes, so the owl 
doesn't associate humans with food. 
</P>
<P>
 After Nassar released a group of monkeys last November, he saw two fall from 
trees when a breeze moved branches as they leaped. Now, workers move branches 
inside cages by pulling strings, getting captive monkeys accustomed to swaying 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Hooey, a Londoner who is one of the half-dozen workers at the center, 
recently helped release nine squirrel monkeys into Colombia's eastern plains. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was beautiful, seeing them coming out of the cages and slowly realizing 
there were no bars anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center resounds with the screeches of monkeys, parrots and other animals. 
There are about 500 in all, including eagles and hawks, tamarins, boa 
constrictors and pacaranas -- pig-like animals that are among the biggest 
rodents in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The star pupil, the margay, will soon graduate to a 100-yard-long cage where 
contact with humans is further limited. There, it will be fed live guinea pigs 
in addition to game hens. 
</P>
<P>
 The cage's current resident, an ocelot, has learned quickly. It now hunts the 
guinea pigs. At first, it ran from them.

MOTHER CHARGED IN DEATH OF GIRL DUG UP IN FLORIDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mother of a 7-year-old girl whose body was dug from a shallow grave a week 
ago was charged Friday with the child's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case with striking similarities to the murders of two young children in 
Union, S.C., Pauline Zile reported on Oct. 22 that her daughter, Christina 
Holt, had been abducted from a restroom at a Ft.Lauderdale, Fla., flea market. 
</P>
<P>
 Police launched a nationwide search, and the mother became a familiar figure 
on south Florida television as she tearfully pleaded for the safe return of her 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days after she reported the girl missing, police said Zile, 24, confessed 
that her husband had beaten the child to death weeks earlier, and the two had 
concocted the abduction story to cover the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter John Zile, 32, who was charged a week ago Friday with first-degree 
murder, led police to the girl's body, which he had buried behind a shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline Zile was charged with first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.

TOWN CAUGHT IN WAL-MART VS. K MART STRUGGLE; BUSINESS: SULPHUR SPRINGS, TEX., 
RESIDENTS HOPE TO KEEP DOORS OPEN AT ONE K MART OF 110 SLATED FOR CLOSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In her 79 years, Lorene Irby has watched the wagons disappear from the 
bustling courthouse square where her father ran a cafe. She's gone from being a 
dairy farmer to selling cow-print merchandise in the Milk Cow Emporium at the 
county's dairy museum. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, she's seen a mammoth new Wal-Mart Supercenter open and her town's K 
mart destined to close. 
</P>
<P>
 That, she doesn't like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like K mart," Irby said. "You can find everything at K mart you can find at 
Wal-Mart." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Wal-Mart is "too big a store for an old person like me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 K mart Corp.'s announcement in September that it was closing 110 
under-performing stores nationwide had little impact in cities like Dallas, 
where most shoppers have easy access to a variety of discount retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's different in this town of 15,000, about 80 miles to the northeast. 
Residents waged a letter-writing campaign when K mart considered closing the 
Sulphur Springs store a few years ago. Now some are asking the company to 
change its mind again, said Bill Elliott, executive vice president of the 
Hopkins County Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to see it go. It's just a shame we can't keep them both," said Sue 
Manley, a secretary from nearby Greenville making a quick trip to K mart. 
</P>
<P>
 On a weekday afternoon, it's busy at both the K mart and the Wal-Mart, which 
sit less than 1 1/2 miles apart on the town's main drag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wal-Mart Supercenter, which opened in May, is a massive gray building with 
a grocery added to the conventional Wal-Mart. It sits incongruously across the 
street from a bucolic field where cows graze near a tumbledown wood barn. 
</P>
<P>
 The K mart is much older and smaller, a place where local teen-agers gather in 
the parking lot on weekend nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers at the K mart repeatedly faulted the new store for what they called 
a lack of service and long checkout lines, as well as its size. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't do all that walking at Wal-Mart. It's too much," said Bobbie 
Holder, who bought a doll at K mart for her great-granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get people to wait on you here, and you can't over there," said Jacky 
Wilks, a carpenter. He said he recently walked out of Wal-Mart when no one 
would help him reach the $119 bicycle he wound up buying elsewhere for his 
10-year-old daughter. "I waited so long I left," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Irma Diosdado shopped for clothes with her 18-month-old daughter, she was 
disappointed to learn the K mart will be shuttered. "This is my favorite store 
for clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Sulphur Springs Wal-Mart, most shoppers said they are loyal to its 
low prices and convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got everything," said Sue Stephens, a homemaker shopping for 
Halloween costumes with her 6-year-old grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Westbrook, a lab technician flipping through pictures of Halloween 
costumes in pattern books, said she prefers Wal-Mart's employees, environment 
and prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can just get everything here in one stop," Westbrook said. "I can get my 
pattern here and go buy my groceries." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Nix was shopping for winter clothes for her three children. "The prices 
are a lot cheaper than everywhere else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 K mart, which has 2,350 discount stores, is renovating or replacing hundreds 
of its older outlets to make them more competitive with Wal-Mart, Target and 
other discounters. Many of the older stores are small or outdated -- problems 
similar to those at the Sulphur Springs K mart. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailing analyst Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report 
in Berkeley Heights, N.J., said Wal-Mart isn't to blame for troubles at K mart 
or another competitor, Woolworth Corp., whose general-merchandise stores have 
also lost business to Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when you look at K mart and you look at Woolworth, you look at two 
very troubled companies. They're not troubled because of Wal-Mart; they're 
troubled because of serious, severe internal problems," Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wal-Mart is really doing very little other than taking advantage of these 
situations, but it is not that Wal-Mart is killing them. Wal-Mart is killing 
them because they are sitting ducks for allowing themselves to be killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sulphur Springs might land another K mart someday, or a different discount 
store, said Leonard Berry, director of the Center for Retailing Studies at 
Texas A&M University. More retail chains are seeing opportunities in mid-size 
and smaller markets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wal-Mart won't be the only store in town when K mart is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart has other competition -- Sulphur Springs' hardware and grocery 
stores. Few of them are losing much business, Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Riley, general manager of Masters Western Store in Sulphur Springs, said 
he really hasn't had to cut prices since Wal-Mart opened because his customers 
want service from his store, which sells hardware, major appliances and fine 
jewelry and offers its own financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Emerson, a Sulphur Springs police officer, said he has been shopping at 
Masters for 15 years and likes being able to go directly to what he's looking 
for. "It's just one of those things where, whatever you need, they've got it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson also said he appreciates being allowed to handle the guns at Masters 
instead of looking at them behind a counter, as at Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought a lot of my guns here," he said. "It's just a lot more personable, I 
guess."

FLEA MARKETS, CHECKOUT LINES AMONG VOTERS' OPTIONS; ELECTORATE: HOPING TO BOOST 
TURNOUT, OFFICIALS ARE GETTING CREATIVE WITH PROGRAMS SUCH AS EARLY VOTING, 
NO-EXCUSE ABSENTEE VOTING, RETAIL VOTING AND MAIL-IN VOTING.

<P>
 If you're an old-fashioned type who thinks voting is something you do on 
Election Day, think again. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time polls open Nov. 8, up to one-third of all Texas voters will have 
cast their ballots -- at flea markets, stores and in church parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, an estimated one in five voters will vote before Election Day, 
without ever setting foot in a polling place. 
</P>
<P>
 And in two Washington counties, nobody will go to the polls on Election Day. 
Island and Ferry counties are running their elections entirely by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to boost America's chronically low voter turnout, election officials 
and legislators are getting creative, trying to make voting more convenient 
with programs such as early voting, no-excuse absentee voting, retail voting 
and mail-in voting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Convenience sells, no matter what business you're in," said Art Hyland, 
auditor in Island County, which has mailed ballots to every registered voter. 
</P>
<P>
 With the innovations, however, come concerns that tinkering with democracy's 
most sacred rite may have unwelcome results, including higher costs, increased 
risk of fraud, and a loss of community spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary King of Olympia, Wash., got a ballot in the mail two weeks before the 
state's Sept. 20 primary. Olympia is in Thurston County, one of seven 
Washington counties that for the first time this year conducted the primary 
entirely by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was absolutely no sense of community," said King. He enjoys voting at a 
polling place, where he can see neighbors, punch his ballot in secret, then 
drop it with satisfaction into the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting by mail felt "like paying a bill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new age of innovative voting dates at least to 1977, when California ended 
its requirement that only disabled voters or those who would be away on 
Election Day could use absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Now any Californian can vote absentee and, in recent years, Republican and 
Democratic party leaders have made a science of identifying supporters and 
encouraging them to vote absentee. In the June primary, absentee ballots made 
up 20% of all votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three other states -- Oklahoma, Oregon and Washington -- have similar 
"no-excuse" absentee balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven states take the idea a step further. Arizona, California, Colorado, 
Iowa, Nevada, Tennessee and Texas offer some form of early voting, allowing or 
encouraging voters to cast "in-person absentee ballots" at polling stations 
before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, Texas' most populous counties have provided satellite and mobile 
voting stations starting 20 days before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Bexar County, encompassing San Antonio, has 32 satellite polling stations at 
retail sites. Five voting vans roam the county, parking at churches, flea 
markets, senior centers and corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 presidential election, 52.5% of all Bexar County votes were cast 
before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But early voting has drawbacks, said Curtis Gans, director of the Committee 
for the Study of the American Electorate, based in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Gans sees problems in early voters basing their decisions on different 
information from those who wait. Debates and media coverage can tarnish a 
candidate's image in a campaign's final days, and early voters may regret their 
choices by Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Early voting also is expensive, Gans said, and there's no proof it boosts 
voter participation. Turnout in Texas was up 3.6% in 1992 over the 1988 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, there's no question that mail-in voting increases 
participation. Statewide turnout in the September primary was 35%, compared to 
53% in counties voting by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they had the option of hand-delivering completed ballots, some 
voters said the 29-cent stamp required to mail them was a poll tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington election officials say they watch for fraud by checking every 
ballot against on-file signatures. Voters sign an outer envelope, which 
contains the unsigned ballot envelope. 
</P>
<P>
 And to those worried about tradition, Washington's Secretary of State Ralph 
Munro says elections must change with changing times. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are on the move, and a lot of them can't get to the polls like they 
used to," Munro said. "When people aren't participating because government 
officials have been too stupid to make voting convenient, it's our job to 
change that."

NEO-NAZI MIGRATION TO DENMARK FROM GERMANY STIRS ANGER, PROTESTS; EUROPE: 
REVELATIONS ABOUT NEWCOMERS EXPOSE OLD WOUNDS DATING BACK TO WORLD WAR II, WHEN 
THE GERMAN ARMY OCCUPIED THE COUNTRY. 
</P>

<P>
 In his haven across the Flensborg fiord from Germany, Thies Christophersen has 
been quietly publishing magazines and books for years denying that the 
Holocaust ever happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of the former German SS officer was long ignored by other 
residents of Kollund, a pleasant town filled with nearly identical bungalows 
and colorful front gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 But revelations about his international propaganda network and efforts by 
other German neo-Nazis to settle in Denmark exposed old wounds dating back to 
World War II, when the German army occupied the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, residents want Christophersen expelled to Germany. Protesters have staged 
at least two violent rallies to demand that Denmark tighten its liberal press 
freedoms law, a backlash that has put the government in the position of 
defending the right of Nazis to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tolerated (Christophersen) because he was an old man and was alone. Now 
others are coming," said Karen Heesch, a retiree in Kollund, a town of 1,500 
people a few minutes north of the German border. 
</P>
<P>
 Christophersen came to Denmark to avoid charges in Germany of incitement to 
violence and racial hatred in 1986. Denmark has turned down Germany's requests 
to extradite Christophersen because he holds a Danish residency permit. His 
work is protected by Denmark's press law. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention focused on Christophersen after another immigrant Nazi had troubles. 
In mid-September, Meinolf Schoenborn, who heads Germany's banned Nationalist 
Front, fled from his home in the southern Danish village of Kvaers after Danes 
attacked his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Press reports said Schoenborn had moved to Denmark with plans to set up a 
training camp for right-wing activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened in Kvaers sent a shock wave through the country," said Peter 
Rasmussen, who owns a bar in Graasten, a mile from Kvaers. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that if Christophersen stays and the press law is not changed, 
"protests will multiply and may get out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after Schoenborn was driven from his home, about 2,000 people 
protested outside Christophersen's house five miles from Kvaers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 76-year-old German has told reporters he could no longer stand the 
pressure and would surrender to German authorities. But Danes say 
Christophersen is bluffing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can't leave. He's the spider in the center of an international web," said 
Siegfried Matlock, editor in chief of Der Nordschleswiger, a German-language 
newspaper in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Christophersen has held meetings with leading European 
right-wing figures. The Copenhagen newspaper Det Fri Aktuelt said he printed 
the neo-Nazi publication Liberty Bells for distribution in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 He prints a quarterly called Die Bauernschaft, which means "the peasantry" in 
German. Under the name Nordwind Publishing, he has produced his own book, "The 
Auschwitz Lie," and others denying that Germany exterminated millions of Jews 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Christophersen, who says he was a guard at the Auschwitz concentration camp 
during the war, produces the publications from a small, yellow-brick house with 
shutters, boarded basement windows and a security camera to monitor 
surroundings. The house is just four miles from the Froslev camp, the 
German-run prison in Denmark during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 When Schoenborn bought his house in Kvaers, he told the seller, Karsten 
Pedersen, he was setting up a business to sell toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strange toys, indeed," said Pedersen, a car mechanic who says he did not know 
the buyer's identity "until it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
 After Schoenborn fled the house, T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with 
swastikas and other Third Reich emblems were found inside along with neo-Nazi 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the house is sprayed-painted with anti-Nazi slogans and the 
surroundings are littered with barbed wire, broken glass and broken poles. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenborn's whereabouts are not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Other neo-Nazis have tried to make a home in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one case, the seller retracted his offer when he discovered who was buying 
it," Deputy Police Chief Bent Rungstrom said, refusing to identify either 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has been reluctant to take harsh action. Legislators have 
promised to review the law on racism, but stress that freedom of speech is 
sacrosanct in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany repeatedly has asked its northern neighbor to tighten its legislation, 
saying neo-Nazis produce hate propaganda in Denmark and then export it to 
Germany and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal appealed to Danish consciences, recalling how 
Danes smuggled 7,000 Jews to neutral Sweden in 1943 after learning they were to 
be sent to concentration camps by the German occupiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These neo-Nazis do things which are against the Danish people's sentiments," 
Wiesenthal told Danish news media.

ABANDONED AND DYING BABIES SYMBOLIZE SOUTH AFRICA'S AIDS PROBLEM; HEALTH: OF 
THE MORE THAN 500,000 SOUTH AFRICANS WHO CARRY THE VIRUS, ABOUT 15% ARE 
CHILDREN. CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS HINDER EFFORTS TO FIGHT THE DISEASE.

<P>
 Baby Gliss never had a chance -- born infected with the AIDS virus, abandoned 
by his mother, now racked by disease that emaciates his face and makes him 
wheeze for breath. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of the helpless, mostly forgotten victims of a growing AIDS problem 
in South Africa that may burden the first black-led government with spiraling 
health care costs as it tries to expand the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 14,500 babies are like Gliss, born carrying the AIDS virus that leads to 
full-blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome and certain death. Each one 
represents the disease's spread through families and communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers are increasing quite dramatically," said Dr. John Burgess, who 
runs an AIDS clinic at the Red Cross Children's Hospital in Cape Town. "When 
you diagnose a child, you are saying his mother's got it, maybe the father, the 
siblings. You are diagnosing a community as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having the most advanced medical facilities in Africa, South Africa 
has not stemmed the spread of AIDS among its 40 million people. Under 
apartheid, the white government neglected medical care for blacks, who account 
for three-fourths of the population, and most AIDS victims are black. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say more than 500,000 South Africans carry the AIDS virus and the 
number could double by the end of this year. About 15% are children and 
infants. Nearly 4,000 South Africans suffer from full-blown AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Africa's worst AIDS nation is considered Uganda, where U.N. officials say 
about 44,000 of the country's 17 million people have full-blown AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Western countries, where AIDS first infected homosexuals and 
intravenous drug users, the disease is spread mostly through heterosexual 
activity in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural and religious customs have hindered efforts to fight it. Some black 
cultures permit multiple partners and promote large families, causing people to 
reject condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Nkosazana Zuma, the health minister in President Nelson Mandela's African 
National Congress-led government, plans to almost double the $6.2 million spent 
by the previous government to combat AIDS. Most of the money will go for 
education and prevention: training health care workers, developing awareness 
campaigns, buying condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 For infants like Gliss, whose surname cannot be disclosed under 
child-protection laws, the money will not matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike adults and older children, babies infected with the AIDS virus die 
within two years, Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gliss' mother abandoned him in a hospital when he was 2 months old and has 
seen him only once at his new home, a Roman Catholic shelter called Nazareth 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been dying a few times," said Sister Margaret, a British nun at the 
shelter. Now 11 months old, Gliss weighs 6 1/2 pounds, less than the average 
newborn, and doctors tell the nuns to expect him to die in his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Nazareth House, a 93-year-old stone building in the Cape Town area, and a 
Salvation Army center in the Soweto black township outside Johannesburg are the 
only two shelters for AIDS babies in South Africa, Sister Margaret said. 
</P>
<P>
 She oversees care for 23 babies -- 11 with AIDS, two with other terminal 
illnesses and 10 with Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy or other debilitating 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The government pays a subsidy for the care of each child that totals about 
$5,000 a month, which Sister Margaret uses to pay for food and supplies, three 
nurses, child-care workers and others. Occasional donations also come in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are their family," she said. "It is very hard for the staff because we get 
so attached to them." 
</P>
<P>
 With the number of AIDS babies increasing, Sister Margaret wants to send the 
non-AIDS children to other shelters to make room. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are piling a lot of money into research and prevention, but the fact is 
we've got the problem now," she said. "We will certainly be able to take more 
children if we get a better subsidy."

AN ANCIENT CHINESE PRACTICE GOES UPTOWN; NEW YORK: FENG SHUI IS REPUTED TO 
CREATE A POSITIVE ENERGY FLOW, BRINGING GOOD LUCK AND FORTUNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It might have been the seven gold and two black fish. 
</P>
<P>
 When the owners of Las Americas Jewelry put the nine fish in their small 
Chinatown store, as recommended by their feng shui master, business jumped 12% 
by the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal lives of their employees are looking up, the owner has new 
business deals and the prescription marble floors generate great traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only that, there's a harmony in the store, there's no internal feuding -- 
and we're having two girls getting married this year!" manager Anna Fung said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about anyone in New York's Chinatown will tell you what they've known for 
years: The ancient practice of creating positive energy flow through a home or 
place of business brings good luck and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, feng shui -- the Chinese characters for wind and water, pronounced 
FUNG-shway -- is making its way uptown. Way uptown. As in Donald Trump uptown. 
</P>
<P>
 The architects, designers and real estate moguls in Manhattan's skyscrapers 
are discovering feng shui, due in part to the enormous influence of Asian 
financiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He who has the dollars will make the decisions on how buildings are oriented 
and designed," said Abe Wallach, vice president for the Trump Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 And those who have the dollars for Donald Trump's billion-dollar Riverside 
South project are from Hong Kong, where the use of feng shui is rampant. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the capital sources are coming from this part of the world, those capital 
dollars come with certain perspectives that need to be recognized," Wallach 
said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before mainstream Manhattan discovered the practice, the ancient Chinese 
believed there were shaman who could interpret signs from the elements on where 
to build a house or cemetery to best harmonize with nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Feng shui masters have been revered in the Far East for centuries as priests 
and doctors able to read the heavens and take the pulse of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Tin Sun, one of the most respected feng shui masters in New York, trained at a 
temple for nine years in Canton, southern China. Today, he has a radio show and 
writes columns on feng shui for Chinese-language publications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The universe is very mysterious. There's so much energy to pick up, but most 
people don't know how," said the 66-year-old master. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tin who advised the owner of Las Americas on everything from lighting, 
wall colors and the aquarium with nine fish, an auspicious number in Chinese 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two black fish always die because they absorb the negative energy," said 
his daughter, Pun Yin. "I always tell people not to buy expensive fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what Tin does sounds like common-sense renovation. Although that's 
true, he said, most people don't know how to apply it properly. 
</P>
<P>
 So he guides them, using a Chinese compass called a luopan, the Chinese 
Almanac and a lunar calendar to combine metaphysics and intuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Pun Yin, also a master, they enter a home and determine the most 
auspicious positioning for desks, beds, the dining-room table, the kitchen 
stove and mirrors, which should never be placed in front of or over the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has a soul," Tin said. "Some people believe when the spirit travels, 
trying to go back to the body, it can bounce off the mirrors. Some people wake 
up with bruises." 
</P>
<P>
 Clodagh, one of New York's leading designers, worked with another feng shui 
master on her interior design at Felissimo, a cozy New Age department store 
just off Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "She helped us locate the best position to generate money," said Clodagh, who 
uses only one name. "The Chinese are very pragmatic about money. Clean running 
water denotes money. So when you walk through Felissimo, you'll see that 
there's a lot of water going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Clodagh worked on Felissimo and other projects with Sarah Rossbach, the author 
of three books on feng shui who studied for 10 years to become a master. 
</P>
<P>
 When she steps into a room, Rossbach said, "I'm seeing how the structure or 
the layout of the home and the office and the external elements are affecting 
that person." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Rossbach told one client designing a penthouse apartment that 
there was a bad feeling as you entered. 
</P>

 "When you walked in, she wanted to have an angle pointed at you, almost like 
this threatening knife, and I thought that was very hostile," Rossbach said. So 
they softened the angle with light and plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some masters charge by the square foot. Rossbach charges, depending on the 
type of job, $250 an hour or $750 for a half-day. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Robinson, a Santa Fe, N.M., architect who follows pueblo Indian 
architecture in much of his designs, became interested in feng shui when he 
realized its similarities to the ancient belief of the southwestern American 
Indians, who built their pueblos to harmonize with the Earth's energy. 
</P>
<P>
 They, too, had a term for it: "po-waha," which roughly means that wind, water 
and breath is the essence of life, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Working on the design for a new art gallery, he sent the blueprints to 
Rossbach, who recommended several changes. 
</P>
<P>
 One focused on a western wing of the gallery, where visitors would enter on an 
axis toward a fireplace. "She felt there ought to be something suspended from 
the ceiling . . . something to catch the energy before it gets to the 
fireplace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feng shui is becoming so popular in the design field that Robinson said he 
fears it will lose its traditional roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's on the verge, I'm afraid, of it becoming somewhat of a buzzword," he 
said. "We'll have to survive that. It's far more powerful than that." Feng Shui 
Tips for Home and Office 
</P>
<P>
 Some basic principles of feng shui, according to several masters: 
</P>
<P>
 In the Home 
</P>
<P>
 * The bed should be cater-corner to the door so you can see anyone entering 
the bedroom. Don't place mirrors in front of the bed, as they absorb negative 
"qi," or life force, that can enter you while you sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid placing the bed directly under a beam. A beam over your feet will 
hinder travel; a beam over the middle of a bed can disturb a couple's love. 
</P>
<P>
 * During pregnancy, don't dust under beds. Some Chinese believe the universe 
is full of "ling," or spirits. The ling try to enter the womb during pregnancy 
to give the fetus its life force. Dusting can scatter the ling and cause the 
woman to miscarry. 
</P>
<P>
 * In ancient China, food represented wealth, so stoves are symbolic of 
fortune. Cooks should not have their backs to the kitchen door or domestic 
harmony will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Office 
</P>
<P>
 * The presence of water draws in money. Companies next to rivers or lakes can 
hang mirrors to reflect the water's qi into their environment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Desks should sit cater-corner to the door with the occupant facing the door 
so they maintain control of their space. 
</P>
<P>
 Exteriors 
</P>
<P>
 * Homes should never be built next to cemeteries and bridges, which can 
reflect negative forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Homes should not face oncoming traffic, which is like a knife to the heart. 
Offices should not face glass buildings, which absorb the negative energy of 
their surroundings and reflect back on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Colors 
</P>
<P>
 * White is the most dreaded color because it symbolizes mourning and death, 
just as black does in the West. White rooms should always be dotted with red or 
green to break the color's negative force. 
</P>
<P>
 * Red is the most auspicious color, denoting happiness, fire and power. 
</P>
<P>
 * Green symbolizes tranquillity, growth and good health.

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in its 151-year history, the famed Tivoli amusement park 
will open its doors under the twinkle of the Nordic winter darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 For several weeks in December and November, the park will open for a holiday 
fair where visitors can buy presents, paper decorations and Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The park's other attractions -- roller coasters, a Ferris wheel and shooting 
galleries -- will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tivoli was built in 1843, on the ramparts that once surrounded medieval 
Copenhagen. The Danish capital has since grown around Tivoli, one of the 
world's oldest amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The park will open from Nov. 18 to Dec. 31, with the exception of Dec. 23-25.

SMITH HELD WITHOUT BAIL IN DEATHS OF HER SONS; CRIME: SHE IS JEERED BY ANGRY 
TOWNSPEOPLE OUTSIDE SOUTH CAROLINA COURTHOUSE. 'YOU'RE A BABY MURDERER!' ONE 
WOMAN SHOUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan Smith's boyfriend didn't want a ready-made family. So investigators say 
she drove to a lake, and with her two little boys still buckled in their safety 
seats, sent the car rolling into the murky water. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, townspeople jeered her as she was led into court in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hold your head up! You're a baby murderer!" one woman shouted at Smith after 
nine days in which she had insisted the boys were abducted by a carjacker who 
forced her out on a lonely road. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer waived the bail hearing and Smith never appeared in court. She was 
taken to a prison near Columbia where a spokeswoman said she would be kept in 
isolation for her safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year-old secretary was arrested Thursday and charged with murder in the 
drownings of 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alexander. Prosecutor Thomas 
Pope said he may seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith confessed and led authorities to the car submerged in John D. Long Lake, 
where divers had unsuccessfully searched for her burgundy 1990 Mazda, 
investigators said. The bodies were found in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Howard Wells said an autopsy indicated the boys were alive when the 
car plunged into the lake on Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her whole world was crashing," a law enforcement source told The Associated 
Press on condition of anonymity. "She caught her husband in adultery. She was 
having a relationship with another guy and he was breaking it off. He had told 
her he wasn't ready for a ready-made family." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Findlay, 27, said in a statement through his lawyer that he broke off 
their relationship Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not ready to assume the important responsibilities of being a father," 
he said. That was not the only reason, he said, and, "At no time did I suggest 
. . . that her children were the only obstacle in any potential relationship 
with her." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Smith worked at Conso Products, where Findlay was a graphic artist, his 
lawyer, James P. Cooney III, said. Findlay's father is company president. 
</P>
<P>
 Findlay went to police early in the investigation with the letter and was not 
a suspect, the law enforcement source said. However, Smith was suspected almost 
from the beginning because of inconsistencies in her story. 
</P>
<P>
 One was that she said the carjacking happened while she was stopped at a 
traffic light with no other cars around, but the light required another car to 
turn it red, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also told police she had been at a Wal-Mart in the hours before the 
abduction, then changed that to say she was just driving around. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's lawyer, David Bruck, would not discuss a possible defense strategy or 
other aspects of the case. All he would say about Smith was that "she is 
heartbroken." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and her estranged husband, David, had issued tearful pleas on national 
television for the return of their children, but her story began unraveling 
late last week when she failed the first of two lie detector tests. 
</P>
<P>
 During the investigation, Wells downplayed speculation that she was the 
culprit. Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said police had feared 
Smith might commit suicide and take the secret of the children's whereabouts to 
her grave. Authorities said they did not believe her estranged husband or 
others were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the ordeal, Smith had maintained that a black man took her car and 
children at gunpoint. The allegation strained relations between blacks and 
whites in this town of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courthouse Friday, spectators shouted at Smith, who covered her 
face with her manacled hands as she was led into the courthouse. Police had to 
hold back a crowd of about 100 people who surged forward as she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has left many in this town heartbroken. Many residents stood by her 
right up until her confession was announced, including neighbor Alice 
Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope they were asleep or something and didn't know the horror of dying 
alone in that car," said Valentine who answered her door red-eyed and crying 
Friday morning. "I'm just stunned and disappointed in the mother. Evidently 
they were in the way of what she wanted to do with her life." 
</P>
<P>
 She recalled holding Alex on her last visit to the Smith home while their 
mother cooked dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always such a happy fellow. He'd always break into a smile every time 
you said anything to him," Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funerals for the boys will be held Sunday.

'STAR TREK' BEAMS INTO SCIENCE LESSONS; EDUCATION: MUSEUM USES THE SERIES' STAR 
SHIP PROPULSION, TRANSPORTERS AND OTHER MARVELS OF A FICTIONAL FUTURE TO HELP 
EXPLAIN REAL PRINCIPLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ANTHONY, ASSOCIATED PRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the emitter array falters, the Romulan Warbird powers up its forward 
disrupter array or the transporter's pattern buffer scrambles a security 
officer's molecules, it means one thing: Somebody's watching "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the techno-babble recited with such sincerity by crew members of 
the fictional USS Enterprise lurk genuine scientific principles about space, 
physics and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Now "Star Trek" fans and science buffs can play with the accouterments of the 
popular television show and movie series and learn something about their world 
-- and their universe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Federation Science" at the Franklin Institute Science Museum uses the 
future's appeal to teach the science of the present. It's a natural idea that 
adeptly weaves together fact and fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to say people watch the show because of their interest in 
science. But the science certainly comes through, and it's a great draw," said 
Elaine Wilner, a Franklin Institute spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, created by the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry from an idea 
by the late Gene Roddenberry, creator of "Star Trek," has been on tour for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, touch-screen displays are interspersed with uniforms and props from the 
"Star Trek" shows and movies. The exhibits are mostly computers programmed to 
match the look of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems we've always been preoccupied with the future," says Patrick Stewart 
(Capt. Jean-Luc Picard) in an introductory video. "All around you is a science 
that one day may lead to a future among the stars." 
</P>
<P>
 At one booth, participants stand in a mock transporter chamber to be "beamed 
down" to a strange planet where they can stay and use virtual reality to wander 
and explore. 
</P>
<P>
 Could a transporter that converts matter -- including human beings -- into 
energy and beams it somewhere ever be reality? Maybe yes, maybe no, says 
Franklin Institute astrophysicist Jim Moskowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology to move individual atoms is emerging in labs today, but it may 
be impossible to map the positions of all the atoms in a person's body," 
Moskowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, there's the big problem of whether consciousness is a physical thing 
that can be disassembled and rebuilt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Program note: Roddenberry invented the idea of the transporter because it was 
too expensive to film the Enterprise landing and taking off. 
</P>
<P>
 Other computers at the exhibit beckon users to push buttons and teach them 
different principles. 
</P>
<P>
 * One console uses gas spectroscopy to help participants discover the spectrum 
of gases -- argon, neon, helium, nitrogen -- by pushing buttons to make them 
light up. 
</P>
<P>
 * A "Code 1" distress call from the space station orbiting planet Runga 4 
challenges the computer operator to change the antenna's direction and 
temperature to filter static and improve the signal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anti-matter, a staple in the way "Star Trek" ships' engines run, is 
explained as the opposite of matter. When the two collide, scientists theorize, 
they would cancel out each other and create pure energy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another console asks the operator to plot the Enterprise on an intercept 
course with a space station and navigate it into geosynchronous orbit around a 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit's centerpiece is crafted to resemble the Enterprise's bridge, 
complete with a Gargantuan viewing screen and an assortment of navigation 
consoles. Here visitors can locate pulsars, plot courses between Orion and the 
Trifid Nebula, or use a tractor beam to change an asteroid's trajectory and 
save the planet Kutta. 
</P>
<P>
 The very difference between the original series of the 1960s and "Star Trek: 
The Next Generation" aptly illustrates how far science has come. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the then-futuristic gadgetry of the '60s is commonplace today, or at 
least on the threshold of accessibility -- such as voice-activated computers, 
CAT scans, fax machines and pressurized hypodermic injections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the technological progress that defines our lives has emerged only in 
the last half-century," Stewart says. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond teaching science, the exhibit seems to propose a more universal theme: 
that today's science fiction, no matter how outlandish and foreign it appears, 
could be tomorrow's scientific fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot can happen in 400 years," Stewart says. "Just look what has happened in 
the last 400 years."

'PLANTATION MENTALITY' UNDER FIRE; DELTA: WORKERS SENT TO SCHOOL TO UPGRADE 
SKILLS, BUT HISTORY IS HARD TO OVERCOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bob Topper supposedly got a 10th-grade education, although he was more likely 
to be found in the barn milking cows than inside a classroom cracking books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was busy working Daddy's farm. I didn't spend much time on school," said 
Topper, now 48. "But they kept passing me on up." 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Sims, 38, didn't get in much studying either during a youth spent 
chopping cotton for $7 a day. Nearly everyone he knew did that kind of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that's what I'd be doing," Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
 But low-skill agricultural work has steadily shrunk in Mississippi's Delta 
region as mechanization, technology and the decline of small farms have 
accelerated. A few decades ago, 75% or more of the work force labored on farms. 
Now, farm jobs account for 15% or less. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an area that's been in transition -- for a long, long time," said Ron 
Hudson, executive director of the Coahoma County Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, transition to what? 
</P>
<P>
 Enter a Massachusetts Yankee into King Cotton's court. 
</P>
<P>
 George Walker came to this land of blues music, soft drawls and intense 
poverty 12 years ago, bringing Northeastern industrial experience, a clipped 
Worcester accent and a vision for a different Delta -- a vision that may be 
sparking a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could sense that the world was changing," Walker recalled. "To compete, you 
would have to offer world-class quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker started by trying to create a world-class work force in this rural town 
of 20,000 for his Delta Wire Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State University and the county community college worked with 
Walker to develop training courses ranging from basic reading and math to 
learning how to use statistics methodology for quality control. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers such as Topper, who shunned classrooms in his youth, were paid to 
study. And Delta Wire paid its employees more than double the local average -- 
some 10 times more than Sims once got for chopping cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like factory work a lot better," said Sims. "It's a better job, more pay, 
more benefits, and they sent us to school." 
</P>
<P>
 The company has grown from 10 workers making high-carbon steel wire to 120, 
and its office walls boast such honors as a Goodyear "best-of-class" supplier 
award and the 1993 Governor's Cup award from the Southern Growth Policies 
Board. Among its customers have been NASA and AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this area, Delta Wire is known as one of the best places to work," said 
plant manager Freddy Williams, who represents another innovation. The 
44-year-old native of nearby Benoit is black, heading an integrated work force 
in a region where old racial attitudes still surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not too long ago, this would have been virtually unheard of," Williams said. 
"This company sets an example." 
</P>
<P>
 Just to the south, in Shelby, attorney G. Rives Neblett considered Delta 
Wire's training efforts three years ago as he mulled closing his Shelby 
Diecasting Plant and shifting its money-losing production to its profitable 
sister plant in Fayette, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Reluctant to close the plant and put 135 people out of work in his hometown, 
Neblett took a hard look at its employees and its management style. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to spend $52,000 for a computer-filled training center outside the 
factory. The community college set up courses for his workers, whom he paid by 
the hour to attend class. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers were organized into teams for decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a significant change from the plantation mentality, where the boss man 
tells the workers what to do," Neblett said. "It's difficult. They still want 
to be directed. The fear of change and failure is still significant." 
</P>
<P>
 Innovations like Neblett's and Walker's are a start, of course, but the region 
obviously needs more than a few scattered training efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, 25% of Mississippians live below the federal poverty line -- 
compared to 13% nationwide -- with figures ranging much higher in Delta 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take time. Church is still out, so to speak," Neblett said. "If 
the education standards are not improved drastically in the coming years, if we 
can't create the work ethic that is so badly needed in this competitive 
environment, I don't see that the Mississippi Delta is ever going to lift 
itself up." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, meanwhile, has become a Delta ambassador working closely with the 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some successes," Walker said. "It's starting to happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 Clarksdale has a new industrial park and the chamber offers low-cost 
"incubators" for new small businesses, in which they entrepreneurs lease space 
and use chamber utilities, maintenance, secretaries and office equipment to 
defray the start-up costs that often kill new businesses in their first year. 
</P>
<P>
 Depicted on advertisements, caps and T-shirts by a contented-looking green 
frog, the chamber's goal, with Walker often leading the way, is to lure a "big 
frog for our small pond" -- a large company to ease double-digit unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could sit over there and run that business very successfully and very 
quietly," said Hudson. "He's the true epitome of a volunteer. I think when all 
is said and done, he wants to know that he's made a difference for this area."

 Just 20 years ago, when Francisco Franco ruled and the military was

military service. Now, thousands do it every year.

conscientious objectors so far in 1994, an increase of 75% over last year, the 
Defense Ministry reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Draftees make up 50% of Spain's 217,000 military personnel, and nearly 
three-quarters of the 145,000 in the army. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Franco died in 1975, the mere mention of conscientious objection might 
have landed a young man in jail. Now, avoiding military service is so common 
that some Spaniards feel it could destroy the army. 
</P>
<P>
 Continued growth of the practice "will certainly lead to a collapse in the 
forces," said Francisco Castanon of the Soldiers Defense Office, a private 
agency that looks after the legal rights of draftees. He said many barracks are 
virtually empty and some officers have no troops to command. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they cite ideological reasons, most young Spaniards appear to have 
more personal motives for avoiding the required nine months of military 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more young people are simply starting to realize what a waste the 
'mili' is and the problems it causes in your professional and family life," 
said Jose Moya Sanchez, 23, of the Movement of Conscientious Objectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many employers will not hire men subject to the draft, and objectors often 
must wait years to discharge their 13 months of alternative public service 
because there are too many for the number of positions. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 so-called "insubordinates" have rejected both the military and 
alternative service; as a result, they are legally viewed as deserters. A few 
have been tried and convicted, but their imprisonment has aroused public 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-draft movements are strong in several other European countries, 
particularly Germany, but none has experienced such a rapid growth in refusal 
to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 It has forced Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to face a question his government 
has been accused of dodging since it came to power in 1982: What type of 
military is appropriate for democratic Spain? 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the reluctance to tamper with the military dates from 1981, a year 
before the Socialists, when elements of the paramilitary Civil Guard and army 
seized Parliament in an attempted coup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has always been afraid of meddling with the army -- first, 
because of the dictatorship and the 1981 coup, but also because it's nervous 
about having a truly professional and efficient army," said Amadeo Martinez 
Ingles, a retired colonel. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez Ingles was forced to retire in 1989 after publishing "Defenseless 
Spain," in which he advocates scrapping the draft for a small, better-trained 
professional force. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, which helped create the objectors' movement, Martinez Ingles 
contends the army is so poorly equipped and overloaded with non-professionals 
that it could not repel even a minimal attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with many other Spaniards, however, Martinez Ingles believes the 
government might encounter strong resistance to a smaller army from 
high-ranking officers who fear losing power, influence, even their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the government seems to have taken a page or two from the colonel's 
book. It has reduced compulsory service from 13 months to nine and improved the 
living conditions of draftees to the point of giving them weekends off. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest government attempt to reform the military is a reorganization plan 
devised by army officers and the Defense Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 It would retain a force of half draftees and half professionals, but reduce 
the army from 145,000 men to 90,000 over six years. The plan would change the 
army's orientation to national defense from its historic role of keeping the 
populace under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts welcome the idea of ending the traditional concentration of military 
installations around major cities and the reduction in personnel, but believe 
even more reform is necessary. Many say the goal should be an efficient force 
that serves Europe as well as Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Moya Sanchez of the objectors' movement, most young Spaniards 
look upon compulsory service as senseless training for confronting an imaginary 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not objecting to the military service because it's hard, but 
because it's meaningless," he said. "You don't even learn how to shoot a gun 
properly."

'TRAIN-SPOTTERS' TRY TO KEEP MEDIA FROM RAILROADING THEIR HOBBY; BRITAIN: ONE 
BRISTLES AT THE TERM, PREFERRING 'RAILWAY ENTHUSIASTS.' 'IT'S OK TO SIT BY A 
RIVER IN THE RAIN OR TO HIT BALLS IN HOLES YOU CAN'T SEE,' HE SAYS. 'BUT IF YOU 
ARE A RAIL ENTHUSIAST, YOU ARE PERCEIVED AS A HEAD CASE.'

 The rumble of a distant train stops all conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tape recorders, binoculars, cameras and note pads at the ready, men carefully 
document the presence of locomotive No. 47803 pulling a load of gravel as it 
passes by. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's 'the yellow submarine.' She was painted in Stratford," says Douglas 
David Gibson, wiping his brow and returning his two cameras to his briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson, 56, and the others perched on Platform 4 of the Acton Mainline 
Station, just west of busy Paddington terminal, are devotees of train-spotting, 
a British pastime that involves seeing and noting everything that runs on 
British Rail's 11,000 miles of track. There are about 2,000 locomotives, 11,000 
passenger cars ("carriages" to the British), and 16,000 freight cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades ago, train-spotting was a popular hobby for men and boys transfixed by 
the gleaming, glamorous steam engines. Now, those who practice it have an image 
problem and are wary of ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray Brown, editor of Rail Magazine, bristles at the term "train-spotter." 
He prefers "railway enthusiasts," and estimates them to number about 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very much derided hobby," Brown said. "It's OK to sit by a river in 
the rain or to hit balls in holes you can't see. But if you are a rail 
enthusiast, you are perceived as a head case and the media tends to latch onto 
this dreadful name, 'train-spotter.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Train-spotters are a familiar sight to British Rail passengers, particularly 
at such busy junctions as Crewe, Carlisle, Clapham in south London and New 
Street station in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-man play, "Anorak of Fire," ran for five months in London and is now a 
cult hit on a six-month tour. It portrays the spotter as a mind on a single 
track: 
</P>
<P>
 "It is true, though, that spotting is a destroyer of relationships," the 
character says. "It is hard to spot and to have what they call a relationship 
-- you know, a girlfriend. Spotting is a closed world. Not very attractive to 
women. . . . There are some women spotters, but it's hard for them to both spot 
and bring up a family, so mothers don't seem to encourage it in their 
daughters." 
</P>
<P>
 To much of the wider world, the train-spotter is a nerd. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scruffily dressed, with black-rimmed glasses that may be held together 
with tape, wearing a parka or Windbreaker. He carries a flask of tea and a 
notebook, camera, video or tape recorder, or all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not portrayed as hip and trendy," said Martin Jenkins, 21, an 
engineering student who photographs trains during vacations. "The stigma is 
daft. Now, you go into a school and you won't find one boy who is willing to 
admit they are rail enthusiasts." 
</P>
<P>
 Women are either uninterested in train-spotting or not encouraged to take it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are one or two -- Allison, Pauline, they live up in the Midlands. They 
are rather strange," said Geoffrey Johnson, a railway enthusiast for four 
decades, who had just returned from riding Swiss trains on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no facilities for ladies," he said. "It used to be a refuge for men 
who were so disposed. But we met one last year who went with her husband to 
look at and ride on trains." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said rail enthusiasts are interested in more than "just noting numbers." 
Booklets filled with pages of train numbers to be checked off by spotters are 
sometimes given away with railway magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasm for railways "covers a whole magnitude of things," Brown said. 
"Many people like 'track bashing,' traveling over every rail line. Now, how do 
you travel on a freight line? That's where it becomes interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stunt, 52, bought a house that has a view of the tracks from the living 
room. He doesn't see any image problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere else, you'd be considered eccentric for sitting on a platform 
writing down numbers and daft things like that," he said, replacing his tape 
recorder in his top pocket after noting the car numbers of a fast-moving 
passenger train. He logs the numbers into his computer at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 David Weeks, a clinical psychologist in Edinburgh, Scotland, has studied 
eccentric English behavior including train-spotting, which he describes as "a 
happy obsessive preoccupation." 
</P>
<P>
 "For some, trains become so exclusive it clouds out other thoughts in their 
minds," he said. "It even goes to lengths where you've got those who work for 
British Rail and train-spot on days off." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson is one such person. He works the night shift as a signalman, goes home 
to sleep for a couple of hours, then grabs his briefcase and is back at the 
rails as a train-spotter by day. 
</P>
<P>
 He is part of a hard-core group of four or five who alternately stake out the 
Acton Mainline for the diesel locomotives and Wandsworth Road, where the 
electrics run. 
</P>
<P>
 When the traffic lags, Gibson aims his binoculars skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an American," he tells comrades sitting in the shade of steps leading 
down to Platform 4. Before Gibson can finish relaying the plane's numerical 
information, Eric Searle interrupts with news of train movement at the depot 
down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hang on, he's got a little crane with him, lads," says Searle, a 60-year-old 
retired handyman known privately to the others as Parrot Nose. 
</P>
<P>
 After the excitement of the passing crane, Young Bob, 52, says: "Had a go at 
the buses yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's my first-ever MD-11," Gibson says, noting the American Airlines 
flight in his notebook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was at the Woolwich Arsenal (bus depot)," says Young Bob, who wears a 
tam-o'-shanter despite the searing heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson opens his briefcase and carefully exchanges his binoculars for a 3-inch 
stack of photographs of trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always take the same photo with both cameras, just in case one of the 
cameras doesn't work," he says, handing over a color snap of locomotive 58010. 
"So I end up with two pictures, but if somebody wants one I can give them." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Fuller, a 25-year-old draftsman, keeps apart from the others. His pink 
tank top has no pockets for pens and he doesn't carry a notebook, just a camera 
for photographing freight trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like chasing big game," he says. "The schedule information is hard to 
get. There's a lot of play -- waiting for the train and getting the light 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in trains, but I'm not one of those blokes in an anorak on the 
platform all day," says the young man, clad in turquoise shorts, black sneakers 
and navy blue socks. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversation is drowned by the roar of an Intercity passenger train, which 
sends the other spotters into a frenzy of activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, they all go mad over the passenger trains," Fuller says.

EXERCISE CAN HELP PREVENT, REDUCE, EVEN ELIMINATE LOWER BACK PAIN, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA DREYFUSS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back-supporting belts don't seem to help. Neither does education in lifting 
techniques. But exercise does make people less likely to develop low back pain, 
a study has found. 
</P>
<P>
 The report in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. reviewed 64 studies on 
preventing or reducing the symptoms of back pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found "limited evidence" to support the value of exercise but not 
enough to recommend one form over another. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercisers tended to have a reduced risk of developing pain, less severe 
symptoms when they did hurt and fewer lost work days, according to Dr. Richard 
A. Deyo, a researcher at the University of Washington School of Public Health 
and Community Medicine in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this is telling us is that, on the average, people are better off 
exercising," Deyo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what exercise is best has yet to be determined, Deyo said. The 
reviewers found improvements among people who did weight training as well as 
those who participated in endurance activities such as jogging and biking. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hunch is that some combination is probably optimal," Deyo said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deyo concedes that flaws in the studies limit the review article's ability 
to draw conclusions. In one study, for instance, a five-week program combined 
aerobic exercise with training on back problems. Study subjects reported fewer 
back problems, but it's not clear how much was due only to exercise, the review 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Deyo and his colleagues are conservative in their 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is limited evidence that exercise aimed at strengthening back or 
abdominal muscles and exercise aimed at improving overall fitness can decrease 
the risk of subsequent low-back pain," the article said. "But the effect is 
modest and of unknown duration." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also unknown how much pain could be avoided by sedentary people who take 
up exercise, Deyo said. But people who keep themselves in good shape are likely 
to have fewer problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There's conflicting evidence on whether wearing corsets to support the lower 
back will prevent injuries, the review found. In one study, airline baggage 
handlers who wore the wide belts had no less pain than those who didn't. But a 
study of warehouse workers found some reduction in absenteeism. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the findings disagree, the reviewers did not make recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies on the value of education showed only "minimal support" for its value, 
the review said. One study that followed Canadian nurses found no evidence that 
being taught about lifting affected subsequent back pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education alone in the absence of exercise or other strategies probably 
doesn't have much effect," Deyo said. People should be taught proper lifting 
techniques, but "that by itself doesn't do the trick."  
</P>
<P>
 But orthopedic surgeon Peter B. Slabaugh of Oakland, Calif., defends the value 
of education. Slabaugh worked on the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons' 
"Lift It Safe" instruction program. 
</P>
<P>
 It is basic physics and physiology that, for instance, holding an object close 
to your trunk as you lift it is potentially less damaging than holding the 
object farther away, Slabaugh said. Holding the weight at arm's length requires 
more mechanical leverage and winds up putting stress on the trunk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, when you lift, the stress and torque on your back is less when you 
hold it next to your body," Slabaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slabaugh does support the value of exercise, however. His independent look at 
the medical literature also finds that exercise pays off.

MALLS, TV LURING COURT WATCHERS AWAY; HOBBIES: A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY, HOWEVER, 
ARE TUNING IN TO COURT TV. SUCH DEVOTEES ARE SAID TO BE TRANSFIXED BECAUSE THEY 
LIKE TO WATCH WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A "NONVIOLENT FIGHT" BETWEEN TWO SIDES. 
</P>

<P>
 Long before the O. J. Simpson case, long before Court TV, people like Vincent 
Provenzano were hanging out at courthouses, watching America at its worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't believe what kind of people are walking this world today -- 
animals -- rape, murder, shootings, killings," Provenzano, a 72-year-old 
retiree who has been watching trials for 14 years, said recently in the echoing 
halls of the Suffolk County courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Court watchers are known by various names. In Boston, the court officers call 
them "outside jurors." In New York, they're "court buffs." 
</P>
<P>
 They went to court before cases like the Simpson case, where 10 seats for the 
public will be coveted prizes, and they'll be going afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 But the number who actually make the trek to the courthouse are dwindling in 
this age of malls, declining downtowns and television, including Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must be a dying hobby," said William Hrabsky, a veteran murder prosecutor 
in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 A million people a day are tuning in to Court TV, said Steven Brill, Court 
TV's chief executive and founder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's probably more of courtroom watching," he said. "It's just not 
going down to the courthouse and going through the metal detector and up the 
elevator. People don't go downtown the way they used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Brill said people are transfixed by trials because they like to watch what is 
essentially a "nonviolent fight" between two sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrabsky said court watchers in New York's Bronx used to give him advice. And 
sometimes he'd take it. "A lot of it is just old folks' common sense. Sometimes 
you get so involved in a trial you lose your common sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those who watched in the Bronx was Mabel Wayne, who gave out packs of 
gum and was given an honorary court officer's badge. She became part of a trial 
herself after her 1985 murder. Now, a street near the Bronx courthouse is named 
Mabel Wayne Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrabsky said court watchers in the Bronx have dwindled to only one or two 
regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This day and time, people don't come in like they used to," said J. D. 
McAdory, a former sheriff in Hinds County Circuit Court in Jackson, Miss. 
"People live a fast-lane life in this day and time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the federal and local courts in Boston, court officers recently were able 
to point out only about a half-dozen court watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just like to see justice done. That's basically all we want," said Louis 
Morrissey, 63, a retired shipyard worker, during a break in a corruption trial 
in federal court. He said he's been watching cases for almost 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Suffolk County courthouse, 64-year-old court watcher George O'Hearn 
said, "The real thing, of course, is better than watching it on TV. But TV's 
almost the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where I kill a few hours," said Provenzano. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, the two men walked away quickly, back to Room 808 and a murder 
trial they were following.

PLASTIC COPIES OF 'ICEMAN' SKULL WILL TEACH SCIENTISTS PLENTY ABOUT THE DISTANT 
PAST; ANTHROPOLOGY: PROCESS SHOULD HELP RECREATE WHAT THE DOOMED MAN'S FACE 
LOOKED LIKE BEFORE HE WAS SWALLOWED UP BY AN ALPINE GLACIER 5,000 YEARS AGO. 
</P>

<P>
 More than 5,000 years ago, he lay down in the Tyrolean Alps and died. Three 
years ago, his frozen and exquisitely preserved body emerged from a glacier and 
made worldwide headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, scientists report they have used X-rays and modern technology to create 
highly accurate replicas of the skull of the "iceman." 
</P>
<P>
 The accomplishment should help scientists study the iceman and recreate what 
the doomed man's face looked like when he was alive, the researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 The replicas should reveal for the first time just how the iceman's facial 
bones were slowly distorted by eons of pressure from the glacial ice, said team 
member Horst Seidler of the University of Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 In prior X-ray studies of the skull, "no one saw (that) the iceman's skull is 
truly deformed," Seidler said. With the help of the copies, researchers now can 
reconstruct "a nearly true face," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One analysis has revealed that the part of the iceman's face between his upper 
teeth and the top of his nose was pressed toward the rear of his head, for 
example. That misled Seidler and colleagues in their earlier interpretation of 
how the upper teeth originally met the lower teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 The iceman, covered with leathery orange-brown skin, is now kept frozen at 
high humidity to mimic the glacial conditions that preserved his body so well. 
Researchers who want to examine him are limited to about 20 minutes every two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Austrian researchers decided to make copies of the skull so that scientists 
could study details of it at leisure without disturbing the iceman, said 
radiologist Dr. Dietzer zur Nedden of the University of Innsbruck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to take all the measurements. It's impossible to see inside 
the mummy because you can't destroy it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and colleagues reported their work in the October issue of the journal 
Radiology. They used a technique called stereolithography, which is used at a 
few medical centers to make models of body parts. The body-part models are 
useful for building hip replacements or planning complex surgery to fix 
misshapen skulls. 
</P>
<P>
 To copy the iceman's skull, researchers removed the iceman from his freezer to 
an examination room kept at about 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, they scanned his 
head with an X-ray technique called computed tomography, which allowed a 
computer to store electronic "slices" of the skull. 
</P>
<P>
 A second computer used this information to build skull replicas slice by 
slice, using a laser beam to shape plastic. The copies reveal not only the 
exterior of the skull, but its interior shape and bones. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Falk of the State University of New York at Albany, an anthropologist who 
studies skulls for research on brain evolution, called the work "cutting edge" 
and "really first rate." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have made three skull copies so far, each better than the last, and 
hope to reproduce the entire iceman skeleton, Zur Nedden said. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers also have made what Seidler said is the first plastic 
reconstruction of a fossil skull, copying a specimen 300,000 to 400,000 years 
old from Petralona in northern Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the original skull, the copy can be cut open to give scientists a 
detailed look at the interior, including the impressions made by the brain, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the work on the Petralona skull replica was done with experience 
gained on the iceman, Seidler described it as "a present of the iceman to us."

 The Prince of Wales is gone. Or at least he's supposed to be gone, as of 
Friday. We go to press early around here so we can't be positive, but let's 
assume he's history. Now we can say what we really think. Of the man, of the 
monarchy, of the shocking media restraint in the face of his first visit to Los 
Angeles in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Shall we dish? 
</P>
<P>
 All last week, I read the papers, watched the news, listened to the radio. 
Prince Charles shook hands, he murmured "mellifluously" as our 
woman-on-the-scene described it, he complimented and speechified. He was down 
in the 'hood, and way up in the hills. But not a soul -- and remember, this is 
a town with taste foul enough to make a tourist attraction out of a double 
murder site -- could muster the nerve to ask the (possible) future king of 
England the only two questions on all of our minds: 
</P>
<P>
 Camilla Parker Bowles? 
</P>
<P>
 Over Diana? 
</P>
<P>
 So we are left to conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
 I borrow my own theory from the work of novelist Ed McBain, who once wrote 
that only two facial types exist in the world: pigs and foxes. Likes attract. 
This is a very serviceable notion, except when it comes to such hallowed -- or 
thinning -- bloodlines as the British royal family. For them, it would seem 
that a third, equine-inspired category must be pressed into service. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the only way to answer the question about Camilla, who is, with all 
due respect, a horsey face par excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana, all fox, never stood a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeee-ow . Or should I say, neiiiiiighhhhhh.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All right. I know. This is petty, mean-spirited, inconsequential stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 In a world of disasters -- Bosnias, Haitis, Rwandas and Huffingtons -- I ought 
to be ashamed of myself for making fun of the much-maligned Prince Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 He is, as a reviewer of his authorized biography put it in the Times of London 
last week, "heir to the most prestigious secular throne (the British monarchy 
being comparable only with the Papacy in worldwide significance)." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, we call that being a major dude. As such, he deserves a little 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Which I would gladly offer, if the man weren't so hellbent on making it 
impossible to give. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * In a television interview earlier this year, he admitted committing 
adultery. A ploy for sympathy? If so, not a terribly bright move. 
</P>
<P>
 * To counteract a biography of his estranged wife, Princess Diana, in which he 
is portrayed as a cold, heartless cad, Charles allowed his own 
quasi-independent biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, access to his personal diaries 
and 10,000 of his letters. According to press reports, the prince retained the 
right to review the book, "The Prince of Wales," but only for "factual errors," 
not interpretation. He comes across, in the words of one reviewer as only 
"partly attractive, partly the reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 * The biography also depicts Charles as feeling that he is the son of an 
emotionally unavailable mother and a bullying father who pushed him into a 
marriage with Diana. Diana is portrayed as a deeply troubled woman, for whom he 
arranged appointments with a psychiatrist in 1982, only a year after their 
"fairy-tale" marriage captivated the imagination of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frequently, I feel . . . that I'm in a kind of cage, pacing up and down and 
longing to be free," went one diary entry, penned by the prince in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting, and probably inevitable, that the mantle of victimhood would be 
worn by perhaps the most privileged man in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Should he ever be caught shoplifting, we can certainly predict what the 
defense strategy will be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These last few years -- anni horribili in the plural? -- with the 
divorce-happy Windsors have been a little too heavy on the soapy plots. Andrew 
and Fergie. Anne and Capt. Mark Phillips. And soon, it would appear, Charles 
and Diana, whose settlement has been rumored to be as much as $30 million and 
perhaps retention of her title. (The queen is said not to mind if Diana remains 
a princess; Prince Charles and Prince Philip supposedly want to revoke the 
tiara.) 
</P>
<P>
 What they have shown the world, these pampered people, besides their 
all-too-human shortcomings, is an incredible disregard for the feelings of 
their two young boys, who cannot be protected from common knowledge about their 
parents no matter how many guards, functionaries, footmen and nannies stand 
between the children and the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Slugging it out in public as Charles and Diana have done, waging a literal 
battle royal for the sympathies of their subjects is pathetic and verges on 
parental incompetence. Not to mention that their public fighting and 
indiscretions have led to widespread speculation that Charles is unfit to be 
king and should take himself out of the line of succession to the throne. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has all the elements of a Greek tragedy," wrote Charles in his diary after 
his marriage fell apart. "I never thought it would end up like this. How could 
I have got it all so wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 To answer, I must perforce paraphrase Shakespeare: Your kingdom for a . . . 
horseyface. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how.

GALLERY: HIS CURBSIDE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a way, Calvin was a landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, he set up his cardboard condos each evening on Towne Avenue 
between 6th and 7th streets, then rented them by the hour or by the night.In 
the morning, he broke them down to make way for the city's street cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin's entrepreneurial bent didn't stop at housing. Displaying his flair for 
fashion, Calvin designs and makes clothes for Skid Row prostitutes, and he does 
hair too. He gets much of the fabric he uses from the trash, but since he's 
based near the garment district, some of the store owners save bits and pieces 
of material for him. The same goes for needles and thread.  
</P>
<P>
 And until he got a room in a nearby hotel, Calvin used to make elaborate meals 
for his neighbors, tenants, and any one else who was hungry and happened to 
wander by. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is to say that living on Skid Row is easy. It is dirty and it is 
cruel. But maybe Calvin and a few others make it a little better.

 Re "Does a Kid Need a Dad?" (Oct. 26): I'm really sick to death of these 
stories about yuppie women who want it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, a child does need a father, desperately needs him and to deny a child a 
father is the worst thing these women could do. Women who choose to rob their 
baby of half its identity are selfish and have no idea of the life of questions 
and anguish they are condemning their children to. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds harsh? 
</P>
<P>
 It's directed at myself. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago I had a baby girl. I was unmarried; the father wanted no part 
of a baby. No problem. I had enough love for both of us. (How many times have 
you heard that one?) 
</P>
<P>
 All was well until the day my precious daughter started asking me questions 
about her dad. Questions I couldn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe me, the teen years are traumatic enough without having to deal with 
this. Every time she looked at me, she only saw half of who she was. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell these women that their children will ask them what their dad was like. Do 
I have his eyes? Is he left-handed? Do I have his sense of humor? These little 
questions will become gigantic gaping holes in their identities. 
</P>
<P>
 The only slack I cut for myself is that I was a stupid 20-year-old, not a 
self-indulgent 40-year-old.  
</P>
<P>
 Someday these women will be facing a tearful, tortured young person demanding 
to know why half of who they are is missing and why this was done to them. 
</P>
<P>
 What will they say? 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, I did the best I could.  
</P>
<P>
 It seemed like a good idea at the time.  
</P>
<P>
 I was lonely.  
</P>
<P>
 Save it. It won't be enough.

 It is conceivable only in a society that has lost its moorings that we can ask 
if fathers are really necessary. This absurd question can be quickly resolved 
by simply asking children without if they would like a father. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time we got beyond the anger between women and men that is behind this 
ludicrous issue of the necessity of fathers. We should stop taking children 
hostage in the war between the sexes.

 I was a wanted and loved child, especially by my father. 
</P>
<P>
 He started a stamp collection for me several months before my birth, read me 
stories, carried me around on his shoulders, helped me with my homework, took 
me with him on his Saturday morning errands. My father was a gifted parent. 
</P>
<P>
 He died two months before I turned 8 years old. His death was the defining 
moment of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of his loving, masculine presence and energy in our home was followed 
by a cascade of subtler, sequential losses throughout the various stages of 
development when my father's continued involvement in my life would have 
provided experience, resources, connections, support and protection. He was, as 
well, my principal teacher of good character, judgment, ethics, morals, 
attitudes, values and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote my master's thesis on how the loss of a father in girlhood affects 
identity as adult women. Sadly, both my literature review and conversations 
with other fatherless women have revealed that father loss is the single, most 
devastating event in the lives of fatherless daughters.

AN APPOINTMENT WITH HYPOCRISY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I pity any gay or lesbian person who tries to get help from Father Peter J. 
Liuzzi ("Extending an Olive Branch," Oct. 27).  
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic Church's position is that the only good gay is the celibate gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Clinton Administration's cowardly "Don't ask, don't tell" military 
policy, the church's view is "Be it, but don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The whole idea of Cardinal Roger M. Mahony appointing a priest to minister to 
the gay community is revolting and hypocritical.  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 First, Father Liuzzi says that genital sexual expression is holy because it 
starts the possibility of new life. He states also that this is the basis for 
the church's teaching that gay or lesbian sexual expression is sinful. 
</P>
<P>
 I immediately think of heterosexual married couples when one or both are 
sterile. Does the church teach that their genital sexual expression is also 
sinful, since they cannot conceive new life? Are they also admonished to forgo 
sexual activity? 
</P>
<P>
 Father Liuzzi goes on to say that if your conscience does not condemn you, 
then it's probably OK for gays and lesbians to have sex in a committed 
relationship, provided they don't say anything against the teaching of the 
church. Just sit there on Sundays and hear the teaching that what you are doing 
is wrong, and let the guilt pile up. 
</P>
<P>
 All this shows that the teaching of the church regarding gays and lesbians is 
still a guilt-fostering, hateful doctrine, and illustrates once again the truly 
sinful consequences of men's vain attempts to articulate the mind of God.  
</P>
<P>
 I hope gay and lesbian former Catholics, such as I am, will see through Father 
Liuzzi's barrage of verbiage, and see that the church's position on 
homosexuality is just as out of step and incorrect today as it was in the Dark 
Ages. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Peter J. Liuzzi's directorship of the Los Angeles Archdiocese's pastoral 
ministry to the gay community is a positive step toward healing the wounds and 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a gay man and former Catholic, I think the positive message of 
acceptance offered by Father Liuzzi is clouded by the church's stodgy position 
on sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 It is fine and fair of the Catholic Church to accept homosexuals as human 
beings, but is absolutely unacceptable to demand we refrain from any expression 
of physical love, denying us our full potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Father Liuzzi's contention is true, that the Catholic Church cannot be 
lumped together with the religious zealots of the fundamentalist right wing, 
they are in the same ballpark -- and playing the same game.

PAST CARICATURES ARE STILL ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Collecting Controversy" (Oct. 19): I suppose I must respect whatever 
choices African Americans make when dealing with the racist caricatures of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 However I can't help but question the motives of the many whites who buy and 
sell such material, and I wonder that Lynell George's article did not mention 
this aspect of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the implications were simply too disturbing. I fear that for children 
growing up in white households where these degrading images are displayed -- 
not for historical perspective or any such lofty purpose, but for their 
entertainment value -- the past is now.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rubi Rosa, the new margarita palace in West Hollywood, is like something out 
of "Sunset Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 With its Gothic hacienda decor and dim, glamorous lighting, it's the kind of 
place you expect to find aging movie stars having assignations with younger 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 "My design theme was 18th-Century crumbling bordello goes '50s Hollywood," 
says Bruce Liebert, who designed the interior. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are these cushy, diamond-tufted banquettes, and then there are these 
200-year-old Mesquite doors ripped from a cathedral deep in the heart of 
Oaxaca, rent and torn asunder." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to choose between the plush, seductive interior downstairs and the 
rooftop garden. For some, that choice might be affected by whether or not Rubi 
Rosa's owner, actress Christina Applegate, is tending bar that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "She likes to dress like a grunge-muffin with her belly button exposed to tend 
bar," Liebert says fondly. "She gives good navel, and she mixes great pink 
ladies." 
</P>
<P>
 "And she tips really well," adds star waiter and bartender Dan Mryglot, who is 
handy with a margarita himself. 
</P>
<P>
 A go-go boy named Adrian shows you to your table. He's wearing some kind of 
sheer white sarong over his carefully sculpted loins, and he looks like 
something straight out of a Calvin Klein Obsession commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching him climb the stairs in front of you is a truly breathtaking 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are you will soon be accosted by a woman named simply Merho. Her 
business card gives a post office box in Beverly Hills and lists her as an 
Artist-Producer-Writer in one corner, and Creative Genius in the other, and for 
a dollar a minute she promises to give you a psychic reading.  
</P>
<P>
 Merho is unaffiliated with Rubi Rosa, but she appears to be a regular fixture. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're having trouble deciding which margarita to order, Merho might be of 
some assistance, although she didn't prove to be terribly accurate in 
discerning anything deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The food is health-conscious fare billed as "semi-traditional Southwestern 
cuisine."  
</P>
<P>
 But it's the margarita menu that is distinctive here. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 31 flavors on offer, with names like La Novia Negra (with Blackberry 
liqueur), Ay Dios Mio (flavored with Rumplemintz) and El Diablo (with 
Jagermeister). 
</P>
<P>
 Be forewarned: The temptation to experiment is overwhelming. It's also fun to 
collect the little fluorescent monkeys and mermaids that adorn the salty rims. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't see it now, but there's a great view of Downtown," says Charlie 
Alexander, licking a green monkey.  
</P>
<P>
 He and friends are on their way to a nightclub after margaritas and shots of 
Jagermeister all around. Given its strategic location on Santa Monica 
Boulevard, anyone with a weakness for tequila will find this the perfect place 
to begin or end a night on the town. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Rubi Rosa, 8865 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood; (310) 657-3116. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Open every night until 2:00 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: House margarita $3.75. Specialty margaritas $4.50 to $6. Dinners are 
about $10.

 It was a real treat when, upon leaving the Los Feliz Theater after a screening 
of "Ed Wood," we happened upon a stack of papers in the lobby with photocopies 
of the actual death certificates of Wood and the pathos-inducing Bela Lugosi.  
</P>
<P>
 Upon closer examination, we found this to be the work of Hollywood's ghoulish 
guides, Grave Line Tours. "We thought it would be kind of cool," says Greg 
Smith, Grave Line's owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who's also been distributing Houdini death certificates, points out 
that these documents are available to anyone who wants to take the trip to the 
County Registrar and, er, dig them up.  
</P>
<P>
 "I loved the movie so much, I thought it would be nice for the theater and 
nice for us . . . and a sleazy way to advertise, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Simple Tastes: On our busy round of recent costume parties, while we found 
most of the ubiquitous Simpson trial-inspired outfits to be tedious, uninspired 
and scarcely worth a mention, we do award a Social Climes accolade to one 
clever minimalist we ran into at a Hollywood party. At first, this reveler 
appeared to be costumeless, until we spied a small, rectangular badge on his 
jacket: "Juror." 
</P>
<P>
 Enough's Enough: "Pulp Fiction" is taking up a lot of bandwidth in cyberspace. 
On the Internet's Quentin Tarantino fan newsgroup (he's one of a handful of 
directors to be awarded such an on-line honor), the flurry of messages -- 
numbering in the hundreds -- following the film's opening have yet to die down. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since Zapruder has a film been so thoroughly deconstructed and 
significance attached to the most seemingly banal details.  
</P>
<P>
 At least one 'netter thought that it had all gone too far. "Do you really 
believe that QT filled every scene or line of dialogue of his movie with some 
hidden meaning or homage to some other film?" he posted. "Give it up. Sometimes 
a cigar is just a cigar."

WESTSIDE WATCH: FARHAT GIVES NEW MEANING TO 'CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eager to win tough-on-crime votes in an uphill race against U.S. Rep. Julian 
C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), Ernie Farhat isn't settling for speeches or 
commercials to grab voters' attention. He's using pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Farhat, a businessman, sponsored a crime-prevention workshop at a USC campaign 
rally Wednesday night. About 20 residents came to get training on using pepper 
spray for protection against assailants, said Farhat spokesman Ross Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Farhat dropped one demonstration from the program. At a crime-prevention 
workshop during the primaries, he played the role of a robber and pointed an 
unloaded gun at a police officer taking part in the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 "People got kind of frightened by it," said Farhat, who is challenging Dixon 
in the 32nd Congressional District, which includes Crenshaw, Culver City, 
Exposition Park, Mar Vista and Palms. "The security guys at the hotel got 
nervous."

 OVERBOARD SIGN ON BOARD: Longtime radio reporter Pete Demetriou takes great 
pride in his KFWB news vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 It carries hardware ranging from scanners to cassette recorders to cellular 
telephones and has been used to cover all manner of stories, including the 
Nicole Brown Simpson-Ronald Lyle Goldman murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle happens to be a white Ford Bronco. Which helps explain why 
Demetriou has gotten such an enthusiastic response to the "O.J. on Board" sign 
he has placed in the vehicle's rear window. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I'm driving, people will look at it, do a double take and just start 
laughing," Demetriou said. 
</P>

 UNPOPULAR PROP.: Proposition 187, the ballot measure that would deny health 
and education services to illegal immigrants, is not faring well among Westside 
city councils. Nor is Proposition 188, the tobacco industry-backed measure that 
would repeal local anti-smoking ordinances and permit limited smoking in 
restaurants and workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The city councils of Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Culver City 
and Los Angeles have all expressed opposition to the two measures. Malibu's 
council has not taken a position on either. 
</P>
<P>
 The Culver City council has circulated letters to local newspapers stating its 
opposition to the two ballot questions, reserving its strongest language for 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187 does not address the question of how to control or end 
illegal immigration," the council's letter says. "(It) is a mean-spirited 
attack aimed at children, who are not responsible for their parents' status, 
and others who are in need of help due to illness or other problems." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, several hundred Santa Monica High School students staged a 
peaceful protest against Proposition 187 under the supervision of school 
administrators. They marched to City Hall during their lunch hour and were met 
there by Santa Monica Mayor Judy Abdo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to tell you that all the members of the City Council agree with 
you," Abdo said. "We all have to work together to stop this horrible 
proposition."

A TEST OF TOLERANCE; VENICE: NEIGHBORHOOD'S RESIDENTS SAY RISING CRIME BY 
INHABITANTS OF A NEARBY CENTER FOR THE HOMELESS IS STRAINING THEIR COMPASSION 
FOR THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Juanita Escalera was watering her lawn one morning when a homeless man 
approached her and demanded water from the hose. Escalera, an 82-year-old widow 
and Venice resident for 40 years, complied and handed the man the hose. Instead 
of drinking from it, the man pointed it at Escalera, soaked her with water and 
coolly walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents blame a nearby center for the homeless for such incidents, as well 
as worse offenses. They complain of open defecation, drug dealing, prostitution 
and violence committed by homeless people in the alleys surrounding their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some residents, describing themselves as liberal Democrats, say they 
are sympathetic to the plight of the homeless, their patience has snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd be one of those 'not in my back-yard' (types). I'm an 
extremely liberal Democrat," said Mimi Lieber, a Venice resident for seven 
years. "I support the idea of (helping the homeless). But it has to be in an 
area where little old ladies and children do not get (urinated) on -- 
literally." 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle of the debate is the St. Joseph's Homeless Day Center, a 
support center for homeless and low-income families on Rose Avenue. Even though 
there are two other agencies on Rose offering services to the homeless, 
residents believe St. Joseph's has not adequately addressed the problems 
created by its presence in a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the same people there every day," said neighbor Eric Rigney, a 
resident of Venice since 1986. "These people have no respect for the area they 
are in. They walk around naked, drunk, defecate (in public)." 
</P>
<P>
 The center has two daytime security guards around the center and the Bread and 
Roses Cafe, a restaurant established by St. Joseph's for the homeless, and two 
security personnel to patrol the neighborhood from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. It has 
hired community relations personnel and a senior outreach person to improve 
communication with residents. In addition, St. Joseph's officials say they turn 
away those who are clearly intoxicated and maintain strict rules for clients, 
such as prohibiting alcohol consumption on the premises and not allowing 
abusive language or behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really take a proactive stance towards our clients about being respectful 
for the neighborhood," said Rhonda Meister, executive director of the center. 
"We want people to assume responsibility in creating a life for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 But the center has little control over clients' behavior outside its immediate 
vicinity and after the restaurant's and the center's closing times. The 
restaurant serves the homeless from 9 a.m. to noon weekdays, and the center is 
open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dealing with people who have been homeless for such a long time, the 
lack of hope is pretty substantial. It takes a lot longer to get them turned 
around and motivated," Meister said. Many of the homeless clients are suffering 
from drug and alcohol addiction and mental illness, according to Meister. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say the center's homeless are increasingly harassing older citizens, 
breaking into homes and causing frequent disturbances in alleys adjacent to 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is opposed to helping people in need of assistance," said Bruce 
Wallin, a Venice resident since 1979. "I've held liberal convictions all of my 
life. What's happened in our neighborhood is wrong. We have been victimized." 
</P>
<P>
 Police statistics show that there were 24 reported residential burglaries in 
the area -- the second-highest in the Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific 
Division -- and 21 aggravated assaults in the third quarter of 1994, but police 
say not all of those incidents were necessarily related to the homeless. Both 
figures represented decreases in the area from the third quarter of 1993, when 
there were 26 burglaries and 31 aggravated assaults, according to LAPD figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents also complain of what they say is inadequate response from the 
police and Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police won't come unless you have a physical emergency," Rigney said. 
"You get to the point where you start walking around with a baseball bat." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Richard LaGarra of the Pacific Division said he is doing the best he can 
with the resources available. He has assigned one patrol car for the area 
around the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it doesn't make people feel good, but we have to prioritize," LaGarra 
said. "We don't ignore those calls, but we cannot at this point deploy more 
officers to the area around St. Joseph's. If there is a violation, then we 
respond." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Prang, a spokesman for Galanter, said the councilwoman's staff is 
"working hard to facilitate a discussion between St. Joseph's and the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been meetings recently among St. Joseph's Center, local residents 
and a county Bar Dispute Resolution facilitator with the hopes of increasing 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to work together, but oftentimes (these problems) are out of 
our eyesight. We would like to develop some way where there is communication 
between St. Joseph's and the neighborhood," Meister said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the negotiations do not produce improved relations, residents say they are 
unwilling to tolerate much more. 
</P>
<P>
 "People all over the city have had enough," Wallin said.

EDUCATION; REFORM JEWISH HIGH SCHOOL MOVING TO HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's only Reform Jewish high school will move to temporary classrooms 
this month on what eventually will be a $25-million campus hugging a hillside 
in the Sepulveda Pass amid a cluster of Jewish institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was launched three years ago by the 3,000-family Stephen S. Wise 
Temple of Bel-Air, the second-largest synagogue in the country. But the 
impending move is a big step upward for the temple's ambitious effort to 
demonstrate that a relatively liberal, non-Orthodox high school can fill the 
Judaic education gap for teen-agers who might otherwise drift away from Jewish 
culture and faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-age education is critical to the future of Jewish life in America," said 
the temple's senior rabbi, Isaiah Zeldin. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Reform and Conservative synagogues "have day schools up to the age of 13, 
but we do very poorly beyond the bar and bat mitzvahs," Zeldin said, referring 
to the Jewish coming-of-age ceremonies for adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orthodox synagogues have had high schools for 50 years," Zeldin said, "but 
with our elementary, middle school and now high school classes, we have the 
only non-Orthodox K-through-12 school west of Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stephen Wise Community Middle/High School has not only a well-to-do 
congregation behind it but also a culturally rich location -- "a little piece 
of Jewish heaven," in the words of Headmaster Bruce Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 The elongated, 9.7-acre campus runs along Mulholland Drive just west of the 
San Diego (405) Freeway and up from the Skirball Cultural Center under 
construction on Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural center is being built by Hebrew Union College, another Reform 
Jewish institution. Slated to open next fall, the center will feature a museum 
and an academic conference center devoted to the theme of "exploring the 
American Jewish experience," said Executive Director Cindy Miscikowski. Across 
from the center on the eastern side of the freeway, also off Mulholland Drive, 
is the Conservative-aligned University of Judaism, and farther up the hill, the 
Stephen S. Wise Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school students, who now take classes in rooms at the temple, have 
library privileges and access to a science laboratory at the University of 
Judaism, and that will continue, Zeldin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council approved the building project in February, after 
modifications were made in the plans last year to meet objections by some 
neighbors worried about school-related traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The school will be limited to 165 students for several years while classes are 
held in temporary modular buildings on the site. Although current enrollment is 
195 students in grades nine through 12, Powell said that at any given time 
about three dozen students will be at the old site in science or 
physical-education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase of construction, to be completed by 1997, will permit an 
enrollment of up to 650 students, including seventh- and eighth-grade students 
who now meet in temporary buildings farther west on Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Permanent facilities at the east end of the campus closest to the freeway will 
include a three-story building for classes and offices as well as library, 
gymnasium and multipurpose facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (roof of the) building can't be more than 15 feet above Mulholland Drive, 
so the main building will only be three stories at the base of the hillside," 
the rabbi explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, as stipulated by the city, the school will plant bushes and trees along 
a narrow, 2,000-foot stretch between Mulholland and the school property. 
</P>
<P>
 To alleviate traffic, the school will continue to shuttle many students by bus 
from parking lots in the San Fernando Valley and the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said that the temple's schools draw equal numbers of students from 
north and south of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a middle school for close to 15 years now," Zeldin said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Zeldin, 74, the synagogue's schools have been a major accomplishment for 
Jewish education during his 31 years as the congregation's spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also demonstrated the more mundane enthusiasms associated with high 
school spirit. Only minutes into an initial interview, Zeldin marveled over the 
14-7 water-polo victory by the Stephen Wise Wildcats over Calabasas High. 
</P>
<P>
 An upset, he boasted.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; ACTOR'S DAUGHTER FIGHTS FOR HIS OSCAR

<P>
 Sixteen years after Gig Young's death, his daughter is waging a public battle 
for the actor's 1969 Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Young, 30, the late actor's only child and sole surviving relative, 
claims that she is entitled to the statuette her father won for his supporting 
role in "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" But Beverly Hills talent agent Martin 
Baum says that Gig Young made no mention of the Oscar in his will and that he 
is now the rightful owner of the award. Baum suggested that Jennifer Young, an 
aspiring country-Western singer and actress, has launched the Oscar crusade 
strictly for publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Oscar is mine. She has no right to it. She was given whatever was due her 
in her father's will," said Baum, who keeps the statuette in his office at 
Creative Artists Agency. Baum cast Gig Young in the award-winning role during 
his three-year stint as president of ABC Pictures. He had been the actor's 
friend and agent for more than eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978 in New York, Gig Young shot his 31-year-old wife, Kim Schmidt, to 
death and then turned the gun on himself. Young, 64, had been plagued by 
alcoholism throughout his 35-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 Gig Young bequeathed Jennifer Young, his daughter from a previous marriage, 
only a meager inheritance and left most of his possessions to his sister, 
Genevieve Barr Merry, without mentioning the Oscar. Merry, according to Baum, 
acquired the statuette and turned it over to him 7 years ago. Merry has since 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, according to a spokesman for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts 
and Sciences, which presents the awards, Gig Young's Oscar belongs to neither 
Baum nor Jennifer Young. The statuettes, although loaned to award winners, are 
ultimately the property of the academy, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young has hired attorney Melvin Belli and is threatening to sue if she doesn't 
get the Oscar. Belli's partner, Kevin McClain, said he will first petition the 
academy to grant Young the right to possess her father's Oscar before 
proceeding with any court action. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Young said she has already written to Baum requesting the statuette, 
to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm praying that you can find it in your heart to give back a piece of my 
father by handing over his Oscar to me," Young wrote Baum in August. "I know 
you have it proudly displayed in a glass case in your office. My dad's Academy 
Award was his greatest success, as well as my greatest inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 Young declined to discuss the specifics of her father's will, but attributed 
her meager inheritance to her father's bitterness over his 1968 divorce from 
her mother, Beverly Hills "realtor to the stars" Elaine Young. He previously 
was married to Elizabeth Montgomery, who later starred in the "Bewitched" 
television series. 
</P>
<P>
 The suave actor was nominated for an Academy Award for his supporting role in 
"Teacher's Pet" in 1958. But it was his portrayal of a smarmy dance marathon 
promoter opposite Jane Fonda in "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" that won him 
the award for best supporting actor. B.J. PALERMO

<P>
 In a 2-1 vote, a Los Angeles City Council committee last week approved a 
30-story apartment development at Wilshire Boulevard and Barrington Avenue that 
has drawn opposition from a Native American tribe and nearby homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The development has been in the planning stage for three years.It is being 
opposed by some members of the Tongva tribe, which claims that project 
excavation will irreparably damage the tribe's officially protected underground 
springs nearby. Several environmentalists and homeowners groups have also 
opposed the development, saying that traffic congestion would result from the 
335-unit complex. 
</P>
<P>
 But the developer, Barrington Plaza Ltd., contends that mitigations it has 
agreed to will both protect the springs and ease the flow of increased traffic 
along Wilshire and Barrington. Barrington Plaza officials say they will produce 
quarterly reports on the level of ground water during construction and have an 
archeologist on hand to monitor the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, though some members of the Tongva tribe continue to oppose the 
development, the project is now supported by the Tongva tribal council. SCOTT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A summary of selected City Hall actions last week that affect the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * EGYPTIAN THEATER -- Voted to open negotiations with American Cinematheque on 
the possible sale of the Egyptian Theater at 6708 Hollywood Blvd. by the 
Community Redevelopment Agency.Once one of the city's premier movie theaters, 
the 1922 building was purchased by the CRA in 1993 for restoration and 
preservation. But the Jan. 17 earthquake caused an estimated $4 million in 
damages to the theater, and the CRA foresees only being able to finance those 
repairs. Plans for the renovation have been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 * HISTORIC DESIGNATION -- Voted to include the Hollywood School/Women's Club, 
a 1909 building at 1749 N. La Brea Ave., on the city's list of 
Historic-Cultural Monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 * STREET NAME -- Approved the name Rustic Creek Lane for a previously unnamed 
private street at Sunset Boulevard near Will Rogers State Park. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * HIRING FREEZE LIFTED -- Approved an exemption to the city's hiring freeze 
that will allow the Department of Parks and Recreation to fill 105 gardening 
positions. The jobs -- 72 gardener caretakers and 33 senior gardeners -- will 
involve work at city parks. Those who opposed the motion did so because they 
favored a more ambitious plan that would have allowed the parks and recreation 
department an exemption to fill 1,166 positions as they become vacant. A vote 
on that latter plan was rescheduled for Nov. 15. Passed 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting yes: Marvin Braude, John Ferraro, Jackie Goldberg, Nate Holden, Zev 
Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting No: Mark Ridley-Thomas.

 Absent: Ruth Galanter. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

COVER STORY; SHOCK VALUE; POLITICS: DEFIANT CULVER CITY MAYOR ALBERT VERA

HIS PROPOSAL ALSO HAS GENERATED HEAT FROM OFFICIALS AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

 As he walks between the rows of olive trees, Albert Vera reaches up and plucks 
off one of the green, acorn-sized fruits, then places it carefully atop a 
bucket heaping with olives picked by a field hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's pick those trees over there next," he says to the foreman, motioning to 
a section of trees in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tiny town of Lindsay, about 45 minutes north of Bakersfield, Vera is 
owner and lord of an olive fiefdom consisting of 26 ranches, thousands of 
acres, a country bungalow, several dogs, even some rare white peacocks. 
</P>
<P>
 He is every bit the no-nonsense boss. When he bought his first olive ranch, 
Vera knew nothing about growing olives -- only that he wanted to be in the 
business. Now he is the area's largest landowner and one of its biggest olive 
producers, locals say. Says Vera: "If you tell me I can't do something, by God 
I'll learn how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's this defiant, straight-ahead style that, as mayor of Culver City, Vera 
has displayed in his drive to have the city take over local electric service 
from Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera has argued for over a year that Culver City should create a city-run 
utility to lower electric rates for its residents. Says Vera: "Edison has made 
millions off rate payers. I want the profits to remain in the cities." 
Recently, he has been urging eight area cities -- Culver City included -- to 
collectively demand rate reductions from Edison and consider creating a joint 
agency to purchase electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vera's vision of a city-owned utility has angered Edison, and the giant 
power provider has its share of allies in Culver City. Critics call the mayor's 
proposal half-baked. Vera's single-minded approach may work wonders in the 
olive groves, they say, but it could cause major problems in an area as 
complicated as municipal electric service. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a lot of ideas. He seems to come up with a new one every week, but 
he doesn't think about them enough before he presents them," says Ed Little, a 
former City Council member who is still active in Culver City politics. "People 
are afraid that the city can't run its own utility efficiently, yet Albert is 
like a bulldog when he gets an idea in his head." 
</P>
<P>
 Vera, who was first elected to the Culver City City Council in 1992, 
acknowledges that he often feels frustrated with the inertia of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "By yourself, you can do things and get them done, but in politics you have to 
discuss everything and by the time you're done, you get disgusted with it," 
says Vera, who, in addition to olive growing, has owned and operated Sorrento's 
Deli in Culver City since 1963. "I'm used in life to doing things, 
accomplishing things." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for things to happen never has been Vera's style. If it were, his 
rags-to-riches story might have read quite differently. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1950, at age 15, he arrived in New York from a small town near Naples, 
Italy. Vera came as an American citizen -- his mother was born in the United 
States, but moved to Italy before he was born. During his first year in this 
country, he moved with an aunt to Culver City, where he has lived ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke no English, had no money, and wanted desperately to go home, he says. 
"Every time I opened my mouth, people laughed at me," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not take him long to learn English, although he retains a heavy Italian 
accent. Nor did it take him long to make his way in business. In 1962, he 
bought a white van and started a refrigerated deli on wheels. Vera drove a 
two-week circuit from Culver City down to San Diego and then up to San Jose, 
making home deliveries of fresh mozzarella and other deli items to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after starting his portable deli, he married his wife, Ursula, a native 
of Germany, and together they opened Sorrento's Deli. The shop still stands in 
the same Sepulveda Boulevard location, though it is twice as large as the 
original store. 
</P>
<P>
 It was while he was driving through the San Joaquin Valley that Vera decided 
to get into the olive business. He bought his first ranch in the early 1960s. 
Clueless about farming, Vera called professors of agriculture at several 
California universities for information. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he produces between 1,200 and 1,500 tons of olives annually, bottling some 
whole and crushing some for olive oil. He sells both products under a private 
label, Vera Ranches, at his own store and through distributors. He also sells 
Italian coffee and wine under his own label. 
</P>
<P>
 At least twice a week, Vera makes the 3 1/2-hour trip to Lindsay, most of the 
driving time spent on a cellular phone conducting his business as mayor -- 
talking to reporters, getting updates on projects, responding to complaints 
from city residents. On one recent afternoon, he was behind the counter at 
Sorrento's, serving up sandwiches and conversation. There, too, he talks city 
politics with the locals -- and contributes to numerous causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He buries people in donated food . . . he does a lot of nice things for 
people and organizations around here," says Dr. Richard Schoenbaum, a Culver 
City dentist who is a member of Citizens Allied for Reliable Electricity 
(CARE), a Culver City group that formed in opposition to Vera's utility 
takeover proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera was able to draw on such goodwill in 1992 when he first won election to 
the council. This year, his council colleagues appointed him mayor, a post that 
rotates from council member to council member every year. Throughout, Vera has 
prided himself on getting things done. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera's harshest critics soften their tone when they speak of his success after 
the Northridge earthquake in squeezing $250,000 out of the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors to finish a street rebuilding project in downtown Culver 
City. The work, part of a $10 million downtown redevelopment project, had been 
under way before the quake, but Vera argued that it should be completed 
immediately to offset traffic problems caused by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Vera proudly: "I got a quarter of a million dollars in two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 He is also credited with lobbying the federal government for more than 
$800,000 to rebuild Culver City's 45-year-old public swimming pool, which 
sustained heavy damage in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 To generate more revenue for the city, Vera is working with Culver National 
Bank to create a Culver City credit card that would direct up to 3% of each 
cardholder's interest payments to municipal coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 He also successfully sponsored a voluntary program under which Culver City 
receives price reductions from vendors whom it pays within 10 days. And he was 
the driving force behind a "buy local" policy considered partly responsible for 
the city's purchase of more than $900,000 in goods and services from local 
businesses last year, out of total expenditures of more than $12 million. In 
the first four months of the current fiscal year, the city has turned to local 
businesses for $576,000 worth of goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera has plenty of other plans in mind -- even if it is unclear whether the 
city will get the funding needed to carry them out. Among the projects: a new 
courthouse in Culver City and a 200-acre municipal golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 By far his most ambitious idea is his proposal for a takeover of electric 
service from Edison, which has had a franchise in the city since 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent most of the past year trying to convince both the City Council 
and local voters that municipal electric service will save Culver City money -- 
up to $10 million in the first year. He first floated the idea more than a year 
ago. Soon after, the City Council voted to hire a San Francisco consulting 
firm, R.W. Beck & Associates, to complete a $24,000 preliminary feasibility 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort suffered a setback in July when the City Council voted against 
proceeding further. However, one council member who says he is open to the 
possibility of municipal electric service was absent from that meeting, and the 
issue may again come up for discussion in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera, meanwhile, has continued to press the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider it at a standstill, but Albert's talking about it as if he will be 
able to do it," said Councilman Michael Balkman. "Some of us know when to stop 
if we lose on our ideas, but Albert doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 In its analysis, R.W. Beck found that it would cost Culver City about $24 
million to buy Edison's distribution system, although Edison estimates the 
value at $100 million. To cover all the costs of a takeover -- including $2.5 
million in legal, engineering and appraisal fees -- Beck said the city would 
need to issue up to $84.4 million in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the study also showed that a municipal electric company would generate 
more revenue for the city than the nearly $600,000 a year that the city 
collects from Edison in franchise fees and property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison has not taken Vera's takeover proposal lying down. The utility has 
issued several reports condemning R.W. Beck's analysis as factually incorrect 
and contends that a municipal utility would prove far more costly to Culver 
City than the current arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera's proposal will never become reality because it is too expensive and has 
generated little support in Culver City, Edison contends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in Culver City are against a government takeover by a 4-to-1 
margin," says Fred Trueblood, regional manager for Southern California Edison, 
quoting the results of a company-funded survey. "Albert has been difficult to 
deal with, and what he is doing now is more about political agendas than 
community benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 In pushing for a city-run utility, however, Vera is not proposing the 
unprecedented. Twenty-seven municipal utilities provide electricity in 
California, and all charge rates that are lower than Edison's, according to the 
California Municipal Utilities Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Vera has shifted his strategy. Working with a City Council 
colleague, Dr. James Boulgarides, Vera has formed a group tentatively named the 
South Bay Joint Powers Consortium. Composed of Vera and the mayors of seven 
South Bay cities, the ad-hoc group's first priority is to lobby Edison for a 
25% discount on the rates the utility charges in their cities -- Culver City, 
Hawthorne, Gardena, Carson, Torrance, El Segundo, Lomita and Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison contends that the group should take its complaints to the California 
Public Utilities Commission, which sets the rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayors, who still must gain the approval of their respective city councils 
before they move forward with their plan, say they are preparing for the day 
when the California Public Utilities Commission deregulates the state's 
electric utilities. The PUC this year has been holding public hearings on 
deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 If the industry becomes deregulated, and many believe that it will, Edison 
will lose hold of its local monopoly and cities will be able to negotiate with 
different power providers for the lowest rate. The consortium is scheduled to 
meet again on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera won a partial victory against Edison when he forced the utility last 
month to begin paying the city's business license fee, a levy Edison had 
considered itself exempt from because it pays a franchise fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the mayor's proposed takeover of local electric service has alienated 
some of his constituents. And some Culver City council members accuse him of 
working behind their backs with the elected officials from other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been more appropriate for the issue to have been directed to 
the council first," said Edward Wolkowitz, a City Council member who voted 
against a city takeover of the utility. 
</P>
<P>
 But that would not be Vera's style, Wolkowitz admits. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Vera argues that people who make enemies make progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Show me a person who doesn't take any heat, and I'll show you a person who 
has done zero," he says. "But show me someone who takes heat and I'll show you 
someone who is successful."

FOR SENIORS; THIS PAINTER IS AN (ART) WORK IN PROGRESS

<P>
 If passion is a measure of youth, Malcolm Wittman is a very young man. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not dismayed that the art world doesn't know a Wittman when it sees one. 
He's determined that it eventually will, and by the looks of him, time is on 
his side. 
</P>
<P>
 He has the build of a longshoreman, the look of a graying cherub and the hands 
of an artist. He's fearless, and he has to be. At 67, Wittman is still a work 
in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was young, I never knew what I wanted to be, but the whole idea of 
creating something -- that has always been my passion," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Friends still ask him what he wants to be when he grows up, and now he finally 
has the answer. "I am a painter." 
</P>
<P>
 Wittman, a resident of West Los Angeles, is the youngest of four children born 
in New York, the son of a pattern maker whom Wittman characterizes as a "hungry 
scholar." Both his parents died before Wittman was 16. 
</P>
<P>
 When he enlisted in the Army in 1944, he was sent to Princeton, N.J., to study 
engineering in a specialized training program. While he was there, Wittman and 
11 others were invited to Albert Einstein's home for a Passover seder. The 
great scientist was then based at Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hardly a traditional seder -- no one asked the four questions (about 
the meaning of Passover). I mean, Einstein had already answered one of the big 
ones. All that I can remember is Einstein dismissing the idea that an egg can 
stand on the wrong end," Wittman recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he finished his training, the war was over, but the Army shipped 
him out to Austria as part of Allied occupying forces. When he returned to New 
York, he attended Hunter College as a liberal arts major under the GI Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittman eventually married, had three children, moved to the suburbs, studied 
classical guitar and earned a living as a background artist for animated short 
subjects. Seventeen years later, he was divorced. That was the beginning of his 
trial-and-error journey through the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 After animation, he did live-action industrial films, taught filmmaking here 
and abroad and then worked as a stage actor in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "A broken romance drove me from New York -- the town wasn't big enough for 
both of us, so I settled in Texas," he said. He was 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittman became an actor by accident after doing a documentary about aging. He 
was required to do on-camera commentary, and someone saw him and offered him a 
job in the local theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot more glamorous to say I was inspired by Chaplin and Picasso -- 
which I was -- or the book "Lust for Life" -- which I was -- but, really, I was 
personally inspired by these people in their 70s, 80s and 90s who defied the 
nonsense about aging. They said to me, 'I have so much time to live.' And so I 
wanted to try everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittman's first stage role was in "The Sunshine Boys." He was chosen to play 
Al Lewis, one of the leading roles. He said it wasn't much of a stretch because 
he remembered his father having a competitive, love-hate relationship with his 
uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had Velcro-mouth -- my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth, and the only 
way I could go onstage was to tuck lemon strips into my cheeks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to perform in the courtroom drama "Inherit the Wind." That's when 
someone from Los Angeles invited him to Hollywood in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Wittman said, he wasn't ready for this town, so he returned to 
Dallas. He made his living appearing in commercials and wrote a screenplay 
about how the government lied to the American people about the effects of 
atomic testing in Yucca Flats. He returned to Los Angeles in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote about issues, and it wasn't entertaining. But I paint in a visually 
entertaining way. You can look at a picture for five minutes and walk away, but 
a play or a movie -- you got to sit for an hour and a half and get your money's 
worth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittman still earns his living doing commercials and voice-overs. He uses his 
fees -- sometimes as much as $7,000 for a day's work -- to rent a studio where 
he paints. He's applying to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's program for 
emerging artists. He participates in the Playwright's Group, continues to act, 
and every Monday delivers Meals On Wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to feel part of the community. We need to be responsible for each 
other. It's part of being a grown-up."

TRAVEL INSIDER: NEW HIGH-FLYING RULES HAVE AIR-TOUR PILOTS FEELING LOW; 
AVIATION: HAWAII OPERATORS SAY THE FAA'S MINIMUM ALTITUDE REGULATION, AND 
OTHERS, COULD PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS.

<P>
 A new set of federal regulations has Hawaii's air-tour operators flying high 
this month -- and they're not happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Until late last month, helicopter and fixed-wing-plane pilots in the booming 
Hawaiian air-tour industry flew much of the time with no mandated minimum 
altitude, swooping low to offer close-up views of fuming volcanoes, verdant 
canyons and wave-lashed coastline. The air tours, generally priced at $60-$200 
per person (often including piped-in portentous music and videocassette 
keepsakes; often excluding flotation devices) attracted an estimated 400,000 
passengers last year, most of them for helicopter trips. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the most successful flights angered many hikers and others on the 
ground with their engine noise, and some other flights ended in catastrophe: 
Authorities counted eight fatal accidents (24 deaths) on the islands between 
1982 and 1991 -- and five more fatal accidents (and another 24 deaths) along 
with 15 non-fatal accidents between July, 1991, and July, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Aeronautics Administration administrator David R. Hinson cited these 
circumstances, along with two July 14 helicopter accidents (one fatal, one not) 
on Sept. 22 when he declared an "urgent safety problem" and set new flight 
regulations. Under those "emergency" regulations, enacted Oct. 26, Hawaiian 
tour pilots must: 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep their craft at least 1,500 feet above the ground and 1,500 feet from 
canyon walls, except during landing and takeoff and in areas where lower 
altitudes are specifically authorized by top FAA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * Equip non-amphibious helicopters and planes with flotation devices (to keep 
the craft from sinking immediately in the sea) or provide an individual 
flotation device for each passenger aboard. (In the fatal crash on July 14, the 
FAA reports, a helicopter with life vests but without flotation devices went 
down off Kauai's Na Pali coast with seven people aboard. The pilot and two 
passengers were killed.) 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still going to get very nice rides," said Jim Martin, 
superintendent of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and a supporter of the new 
restrictions. "But they're not going to be E (ticket) rides."  
</P>
<P>
 The new restrictions also call for pilots to file pre-flight performance 
plans; to maintain enough combined height and speed to permit a safe landing in 
the event of engine power loss, and to brief passengers before flights on 
flotation devices, emergency-exit and water-ditching procedures. FAA officials 
said they are also considering other actions "to address noise and other 
issues" associated with tour flights over the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Air-tour company officials, 23 of whom are represented by the Hawaii 
Helicopter Operators Assn., said they think the new round of regulations has 
more to do with noise complaints than safety, and have sought delay or removal 
of the new restrictions. At press time neither had been granted. Key players in 
the issue were starting to talk about where FAA officials might actually 
authorize flights beneath 1,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who looks at this objectively will see that noise is the key," says 
Bob DeCamp, president of the Helicopter Operators Assn. He argues that Hawaii's 
tour helicopters average fewer than five accidents per 100,000 flight-hours, 
while helicopters and small aircraft nationwide have averaged six to seven 
accidents per 100,000 flight-hours. 
</P>
<P>
 (Last Tuesday, after a report of mechanical trouble, a tourist helicopter 
crashed into the Caribbean near Cozumel, Mexico, reportedly killing 12 
Americans, one Italian and the pilot.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawaii pilots also argue that because of island geography and weather 
patterns -- in some places, 1,500-foot peaks stand beneath cloud layers at 
2,500 feet -- the altitude requirement makes many sights unviewable most of the 
time, including Kauai's Waimea Canyon, often described as Hawaii's answer to 
the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Squyres, a veteran helicopter pilot on Kauai, suggested that if the FAA's 
"unreasonable" and "politically motivated" measures are allowed to stand, they 
could nearly wipe out the air-tour business on his island, where many operators 
are still recovering from Hurricane Iniki. (Squyres took me on a helicopter 
tour of Kauai last year, and we reached many of the island's most remarkable 
views by hovering as low as 300 feet from valleys, cliffs and canyon walls.) 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the islands, air-tour operators said, the regulations could 
decimate an industry that in a decade has grown to include, by the FAA's count, 
38 operators using approximately 97 helicopters and 16 fixed-wing aircraft. 
Tour companies are scrambling now to assemble new routes and set new prices, so 
would-be passengers should be sure they have a clear idea where their tour will 
go, how long it will last, and what will and won't be visible from 1,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest of the state's helicopter tour companies is Papillon Hawaiian 
Helicopters, with 21 craft flying over four islands. General Manager Bill Payne 
estimated that the new rules could cost the company "40% to 60% of our 
business" and warned that as companies adopt new tour routes on the 
more-populated leeward sides of islands, noise complaints could actually 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent events, however, may muffle Papillon's voice in the debate. On Oct. 24, 
two days before the new rules took effect, a Papillon helicopter, apparently 
suffering from engine trouble, crash-landed in a clump of trees in a valley on 
Maui. Three of the four people aboard suffered minor injuries, Payne said.

GEARS & GADGETS: LOOK WHAT THE STORK BROUGHT

<P>
 Family travel always has had its challenges -- creating safe spaces for 
infants to play, keeping car seats clean in the presence of sticky fingers and 
sudden spills, making sure Junior can reach the tabletop in the absence of a 
booster seat and finding just the right carryalls for baby gear and other kids' 
stuff. The items below won't preclude cries of: "Are we there yet?" nor "I have 
to go to the bathroom," but they will come in handy for families on the go. 
Shipping and handling are not included in the prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Babies are a handful -- two handfuls, in fact -- so what to do about toting 
around diapers, bottles and other infant paraphernalia while remaining 
hands-free for the little one? Land's End, a distributor of upscale sportswear 
for adults and children, has developed a backpack diaper bag that solves the 
problem handily. The lightweight (1 1/4 -pound) navy nylon bag has two primary 
zippered compartments; a large one contains two insulated pockets for bottles, 
a removable zippered bag for dirty diapers or other soiled items, and a key 
ring; a smaller outside compartment unzips to reveal a see-through plastic 
toilet kit and a removable soft changing pad (25 inches by 12 inches). Two 
front pockets could hold adult items, such as a wallet, paperbacks, etc. The 
adjustable back-straps are padded for extra comfort. I found the bag efficient 
not only for carrying infant gear, but also as a beach bag for adult wet stuff, 
when baby's not around. 
</P>
<P>
 Backpack Diaper Bag (No. 2887-2121) is $29.50 from Land's End; (800) 356-4444. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Little kids are always struggling with too-tall table tops, and booster seats 
just aren't available everywhere. This neat item not only provides a ready 
boost of five inches, but also has a built-in place to store toys, coloring 
books, diapers, bottles or whatever. The brightly colored purple, green and 
yellow plastic seat (designed for ages 1 to 3) has a fold-out backrest and 
storage space under the seat lid. An adjustable safety strap secures the child 
and the seat to a chair. 
</P>
<P>
 When collapsed, the backrest becomes a handle for easy toting. The whole 
shebang weighs just two pounds. The portable booster seat is quite hard and 
junior may require a little pillow for maximum comfort. But it's great to have 
along in a car trunk in a pinch and can come in handy when other tots come to 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 Portable Booster Seat, with built-in toy tote (No. 101839) is $24.98 from 
Lillian Vernon; (800) 285-5555.  
</P>
<P>
 There comes an age -- a very young age -- when children are able to move 
around just enough to get into trouble. At home, a playpen can solve the 
problem, but what about on the road? 
</P>
<P>
 Evenflo, a manufacturer of children's furniture, recently introduced a 
collapsible travel crib/play yard that comes with its own mattress and fitted 
quilted sheet and a zippered carryall. The two side panels are a see-through 
mesh, the end panels are a solid material; one end has a removable toy bag. 
When set up, the playpen measures a comfy 38 inches by 25 inches by 22 inches 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 The crib fabric is a cheerful geometric-patterned nylon material, the frame is 
a solid plastic, both of which make for easy cleaning. Wheels at one end aid 
mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 This item's a winner; it's easy to set up and pack (the frame locks in place 
or collapses via rotating connector bars. The playpen stores easily in a car 
trunk or as checked baggage on an airplane, though it might be too big (31 
inches by 10 inches by 10 inches when collapsed) and a bit heavy (22 pounds) to 
get by as a carry-on bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Camper Travel Crib and Play Yard is about $80. A slightly larger deluxe 
version is about $100. To find a store near you contact the manufacturer at 
(800) 233-5921.  
</P>
<P>
 The back seat of any car that plays host to young kids is usually a sticky 
collage of everything they've ever eaten there, not to mention crushed crayons 
and leaked ink. The Car Towel is a big soft felt-like pad bonded to vinyl to 
prevent wet stuff from penetrating through to the car upholstery. Used 
vertically the towel can be tied to a head rest and takes care of one kid's 
mess.  
</P>
<P>
 Used horizontally, it covers most of the seat, providing protection from a 
whole back-seat brood. 
</P>
<P>
 Car Towel (No . 728873) is $14.98 from Just Between Us, a mail-order company; 
(800) 546-2255 .Everybody needs a place to carry their stuff -- including kids. 
This multicolored zippered carryall and matching waist pack is big enough for 
plenty of toys, books and other neat essentials, but small enough to be 
kid-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-inch by 13-inch by 6 1/2-inch carryall has a big zippered outside 
pocket, nylon web handles and an adjustable shoulder strap. The waist pack has 
large and small zippered pockets, an adjustable waist belt and buckle closure.  
</P>
<P>
 Kids Carry-all and Waist Pack kit, including child's name (up to 12 letters) 
is $19.98 from Lillian Vernon; (800) 285-5555. Specify primary color mix (No. 
780806) or pastel mix (No. 159206).

CRUISE VIEWS: THE CARIBBEAN SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Caribbean continues to be the single most popular cruise area in the world 
and cruise lines are offering early-booking discounts for passengers who make a 
deposit 90 to 120 days ahead. Passengers have a choice between taking an 
eastern Caribbean cruise from Miami or Ft. Lauderdale, most often visiting the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Nassau; a western Caribbean cruise from 
Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Tampa or New Orleans, which usually calls at Cozumel, 
Grand Cayman, Jamaica and sometimes Key West, and a southern Caribbean cruise, 
which often begins in San Juan and may call at St. Thomas, St. Maarten, 
Antigua, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Aruba, Grenada or Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
 For shorter getaways, three- and four-day sailings from Miami or Port 
Canaveral can take you to the Bahamas or the Mexican Caribbean. Norwegian 
Cruise Line's 1,534-passenger Seaward, for instance, offers three-day cruises 
from Miami to Nassau on weekends alternating with four-day midweek sailings 
from Miami to Key West, Cozumel and Cancun year-round. Fares range from $559 to 
$1,649 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip air fare.  
</P>
<P>
 Carnival Cruise Line's glittering 2,044-passenger mega-ship Fantasy has 
special three- and four-day sailings from Port Canaveral that can be turned 
into a seven-day holiday when combined with a stay at a Disney World hotel. 
Unlimited admissions to all theme parks, a breakfast with the Disney characters 
and a rental car are included in the price, which ranges from $1,049 to $1,729 
per person, double occupancy, including round-trip air fare. Children sharing a 
ship cabin and hotel room with two full-fare parents pay $449 apiece for the 
weeklong vacation, plus air fare. 
</P>
<P>
 A new seven-day Land of the Maya cruise is being introduced this season by 
Regency Cruises aboard the 400-passenger Regent Spirit, based in Cozumel from 
Dec. 25 through March 26. The ship, which features all-outside cabins, sails on 
Sundays and calls at the ports of Cancun; the Honduras island of Roatan, noted 
for its diving; Belize City, Belize; Santo Tomas de Castilla, Guatemala, and 
Puerto Cortes, Honduras. Fares range from $1,395 to $2,195 per person, double 
occupancy, plus air fare, with an early-booking discount of 25% to 30%, based 
on date of sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers looking for a money-saving cruise should check out older ships, 
which are comfortable if not always glamorous. For example, the sturdy Britanis 
from Fantasy Cruises is an American-built ship going into its 63rd year; it 
makes seven-night round-trip sailings from Miami to the Mexican Caribbean every 
Saturday. Fares range from $599 to $1,699 per person, double occupancy, plus 
air-fare add-ons. 
</P>
<P>
 Some romantic couples and singles of all ages find cruising the Caribbean 
aboard a sailing ship suits them best, particularly people who want a casual, 
water-sports-oriented sailing rather than a more formal 
shopping-showtime-and-sightseeing cruise. Entertainment, casinos, live music 
for dancing and activities for kids are scarce on the sailing ships, but so are 
formal nights and assigned dining-room seats. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of elegant 148-passenger vessels called Wind Star and Wind Spirit from 
Windstar Cruises can spirit you away to the yachtsman's Caribbean with calls at 
less-visited, more exotic islands. Fares for the all-identical, all-outside 
luxury cabins are $2,895 per person, double occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Club Med 1 is a similar design, also with sails that are computer-operated, 
but carrying 386 passengers in a Club Med-style ambience. The ship is in the 
Caribbean from now until April 8 with four different Caribbean itineraries; 
schedules and fares are available on request from (800) CLUB-MED (258-2633).

LAST WORD ON STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Oct. 9, Robert Aronoff and Gerda Seifer wrote letters responding to my 
letter of Sept. 11 on the Schindler's List Tour. My letter responded to the 
assertion in the original article (Aug. 21) that Poland was practicing 
anti-Semitism without Jews. My response was that there were hundreds of 
thousands of Jews in Poland and that they were in the mainstream of Polish 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a mystery to me how Poles turned over 3.1 million Jews to the Germans, 
as Aronoff says, since they also seemed to have turned over 3 million of 
themselves to the Nazi Germans for execution. As many Polish Christians as 
Polish Jews were murdered by the Nazis. The occupation of Poland was the most 
brutal in Europe and the very idea that the Poles collaborated with the Nazis 
is a lie. No people in Europe fought the Nazi German war machine as long and as 
heroically as the Poles.

 Both of these letters have a common denominator. They are distorting the 
history and emanating the anti-Polish sentiment, and hate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans killed 3 million Polish Gentiles (in addition to) 3.1 million 
Polish Jews, many in concentration camps. Poland was the only country in which 
Nazis made aiding a Jew a capital offense. Often the helping Pole's entire 
family or village was executed as well. Despite the enormous obstacles, the 
Polish record in rescuing Jews is one of the best in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100,000 Jews who survived the war in Poland were helped by Poles and the 
clandestine Polish organization ZEGOTA. 
</P>
<P>
 The revisionists would like to keep this part of history as a well-preserved 
secret and the media are helping them by committing Poles to the "psychological 
holocaust." This disregard for a balanced and fair representation of Polish 
history cannot and should not be tolerated by the media.

 Over 3 million Christian Poles died during this period, many thousands of them 
for assisting Jews. For Mr. Aronoff to say that Poles collaborated with the 
Nazis and for The Times to print it is beyond comprehension.

 I question The Times' motive for publishing those anti-Polish letters in its 
Travel section. Would it possibly be to discourage tourism to Poland? I spent 
World War II in Warsaw. As a young girl, I participated in my family's efforts 
to help the Jews. . . . Several Jews were temporarily sheltered in our home, 
then taken to other locations. Five lived with us until the Warsaw uprising in 
August, 1944. When the uprising was crushed, we all went into hiding, 
anticipating the arrival of the Soviet Army. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1944, one of the Jewish women we saved argued with a group of 
Jews and brought the Germans who then killed 18 people, including her nephew 
and her elderly sister. One man survived. He came at night to the place where I 
and 10 others were hiding, informed us of the tragedy and warned us of our own 
imminent danger, probably saving our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 For us, and the Jews who passed through our home, the greatest fear was that 
someone from the ghetto would betray. The names of Jewish traitors are a record 
in history books authored by Jews. The photos of Jews being pulled out of their 
hidings in the ruins of the Warsaw ghetto are testimonials to such betrayals. 
No other people but their own Jewish acquaintances knew of those hidings.

 I am appalled at the two letters. The Poles harbored thousands of Jews in 
churches, homes, on farms, and protected them at great risk to themselves. Does 
Aronoff know of whole towns that were executed because one Jew was harbored in 
a house in the town? Aronoff should get the facts before condemning the Poles. 
Nowhere in his letter does he condemn the Germans, who were the culprits. I am 
of Polish descent and I served in World War II in Europe (including Poland).

MEMORIES OF FRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My wife and I wanted to express our appreciation to The Times Travel section 
for two articles that we used in planning our completed trip to France. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was an article and picture of Jim and Karine Marett's barge, the 
"Bateau Mary" (News, Tips & Bargains, March 13).We were already planning a trip 
to France when we read the article and thought it sounded like something worth 
looking into. We decided to take a weeklong trip through the Vosges foothills 
near Epinal in eastern France. We had a wonderful time and would recommend this 
barging experience to anyone interested. The Maretts are now in Holland 
building a new barge. Jim says it will be built to their specifications based 
on all they have learned sailing the "Mary." 
</P>
<P>
 We also booked the newly refurbished Mansart Hotel in Paris after reading "The 
New Wave of Small Paris Hotels" (Sept. 19, 1994). For 800 francs we had an 
exceptionally large room with the largest bathroom I have ever seen in a 
European hotel. The staff was outstanding. As an example, when we arrived by 
taxi we were greeted by an individual who took our bags to the front desk, 
checked us in, and then took us to our room all in under five minutes. There 
was a little traffic noise which was easy to overlook.

THE SEARCH FOR A NEW POLITICAL CENTER; VOTERS' ANSWER: TICKET-SPLITTING

 "Dick Riordan and Rudy Giuliani can go start their own party because they 
clearly don't belong in the GOP," said the spokeswoman for Rep. Mike 
Huffington, expressing the traditional, paro chial view that Republicans who 
endorse Democrats have no place in the party. Maybe not. But they have a place 
in the hearts of most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the party leaders think, Republican Mayor Richard Riordan, in 
endorsing Democratic Sen. Dianne Fein- stein, and New York City Republican 
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, in backing Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, did 
exactly what the country wants. So did Nancy Reagan and Teresa Heinz, the widow 
of former Pennsylvania Sen. John Heinz. Even Ross Perot managed to get in the 
act, endorsing Texas Democrat Ann Richards while encouraging Americans to vote 
for Republicans for Congress. The most interesting story of 1994 is not the 
success of any new parties -- independent candidates are not faring well -- but 
the establishment of a new center in U.S. politics that rises above party 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy for cynics to dismiss the cross-party endorsements in purely 
political terms: both Giuliani and Riordan need Democratic votes to win 
elections; Giuliani has a history of bad blood with New York Sen. Alfonse M. 
D'Amato, the prime sponsor of Cuomo's Republican opponent, George E. Pataki, 
and for Perot, Richards' opponent is George W. Bush, son of Perot's most noted 
antagonist. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more at stake than settling old scores. Whatever their labels, 
Riordan and Feinstein have far more in common in terms of approach, experience, 
even ideology than either does with Huffington. Giuliani and Pataki are miles 
apart in their approaches to policy and politics, even if they both call 
themselves Republicans. Richards is a Democrat whose appeal has long crossed 
party lines. And even if Nancy Reagan was getting even for her husband, she was 
not alone in damning Oliver L. North as a liar; former President George Bush 
may still believe in putting party above principle -- he campaigned for North 
last week -- but John W. Warner, the incumbent Republican from Virginia, has 
refused to support North, whatever its impact on the potential Republican 
majority in the Senate. As for Mrs. Heinz, there was nothing for her to gain in 
endorsing Democratic incumbent Harris Wofford and calling the Republican 
running for her husband's seat "short on public service and even shorter on 
accomplishments." 
</P>
<P>
 Former House Speaker Tip O'Neill used to say that all politics is local. Leave 
Washington, turn off the television and you won't hear too many people talking 
about Republicans and Democrats . Indeed, polls show declining identification 
with the two major parties. The question most people outside Washington seem to 
ask, when it comes time to vote, is who is willing to deal with the tough 
realities of life and governing in the '90s. In Los Angeles and New York, 
Democrats elected -- and strongly support -- Republican mayors. In 
Philadelphia, Democratic Mayor Edward G. Rendell is their philosophical cousin. 
Their approaches to government -- fiscally tough and socially progressive -- 
are remarkably similar. They are leaders of the new center. 
</P>
<P>
 Dividing loyalties is becoming the rule. In Massachusetts, the two most 
popular politicians are Republican Gov. William F. Weld and Democratic Sen. 
Edward M. Kennedy. In Maine, a Republican is likely to be the next senator, a 
Democrat the next governor. In New Jersey, Democratic Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg 
is expected to hold on to his seat, notwithstanding the enormous popularity of 
newly elected Republican Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. For most voters, 
ticket-splitting no longer seems even a conscious act, much less an 
inconsistent one. 
</P>
<P>
 As a candidate, Bill Clinton promised to cross party lines in choosing his 
Cabinet and running his government. He didn't. The only Republican of stature 
brought into the Administration was David R. Gergen, who could have played a 
key role only for a short time. It is not too late. There is a center in 
American politics, if not in Washington, composed of Republicans and Democrats 
trying to make things work, defying party leaders and risking the wrath of 
hardened regulars and protected insiders. Clinton should be their leader.*

THE SEARCH FOR A NEW POLITICAL CENTER; NEW CAMPAIGN MORES MEAN 'TAKE NO 
PRISONERS' RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the olden days of the 1970s, I worked in a couple of political campaigns. 
During one, I came across a piece of thrillingly derogatory information about 
our opponent. No, I don't re member what it was. But to give you a benchmark, 
in 1970 a political opponent labeled Sen. Roman Hruska a "smut peddler" for 
owning a piece of a drive-in movie theater that showed "Catch 22." 
</P>
<P>
 One night, when sitting next to my boss at a bibulous staff dinner, I 
whispered my story to him and asked, "Should we use it?" He paused, for he knew 
if we were caught, the wrath of respectable political and media opinion would 
descend on us. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it was a tight race. "Use it," he finally rasped, like the 
godfather ordering a hit. In the end, from a failure of nerve, I never did the 
deed. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, no political operative in the country would be so timid. The "Should we 
use it?" issue would be settled, because, in a campaign today, I would be head 
of what is now titled Opposition Research. My entire job, respectable and 
acknowledged, would be to dig up dirt on the other guy. 
</P>
<P>
 The question on my mind would be not "Should we?" but "When?" It is said that 
in this year's California senatorial race, the Dianne Feinstein folks waited 
until Mike Huffington had endorsed Proposi-tion 187 to pursue the rumors of an 
illegal nanny and then to serve as matchmakers between disgruntled former 
Huffington employees and the press. No one has suggested that the Feinstein 
camp should be ashamed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Golden State's campaigns are positively issue-laden compared with 
other current races. It is not that the 1994 campaign is unprecedented in its 
ugliness. In 1800, presidential candidate John Adams was accused of procuring 
prostitutes; modern campaigns have not yet plumbed those depths. What we do see 
this year is an increased number of the ordinary sort of tawdry campaign 
charges whose use has grown steadily in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver L. North calls Charles S. Robb a liar in personal matters, while Robb 
calls North a liar in political matters; one will be the next senator from 
Virginia. In Maryland, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes' main radio ad against William E. 
Brock III is a list of charges covering everything from tax evasion to Brock's 
past attendance record in Congress. In this year's saddest case, Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy, whose brother had to fight religious bigotry in the 1960 presidential 
race, went after Republican opponent Mitt Romney for being a Mormon. 
</P>
<P>
 The politicians producing this stuff are, as a class, not known for their 
scruples. But they are not known for craziness, either. If they have gone more 
negative, it is because they think people are more likely to be influenced by 
such rhetoric. And they are right. We see nasty ads because voters are in a 
nasty mood, not just mistrustful, but filled with disgust and thinking 
Washington is their enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are on the left, you explain this sour attitude by pointing to 
Watergate and to the years of Ronald Reagan's telling us government is the 
problem. If you lean right, you will cite the expensive federal social programs 
that failed to deliver on their promises; you will add that well before Reagan, 
liberal opinion-makers created an adversary culture on the premise that 
politicians are corrupted by special interests and we should mistrust any word 
emerging from an official. 
</P>
<P>
 What is indisputable is that at the end of the 1980s, the Cold War ended. In 
1992, voters seemed to react to this change by electing President Bill Clinton 
to focus on domestic policy. In hindsight, it seems more accurate to say that 
the end of Soviet power removed many people's chief reason for thinking the 
federal government a necessity in their lives. You are less disposed to give 
government the benefit of the doubt when you no longer think you need it to 
protect you against nuclear weapons aimed at your head. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, current campaign rhetoric is not just an appeal to some kind of 
end-of-the-war insouciance toward government. The people who make the ads 
clearly think voters want something angrier and more self-righteous. The words 
lie , liar and lying , formerly campaign weapons of last resort, are now 
commonplace. There is no longer any debate about whether or not a politician's 
private life is "fair game" for opponents -- everything is on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 This escalation can only be understood as the result of 20 years of 
post-Watergate politics, in which accusations of moral turpitude became 
everyday partisan tools used by both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the charges were about money; others concerned sexual conduct. But 
political people and citizens alike became accustomed to a highly symbolic, 
moralistic language in discussing politicians and public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we elected ourselves a President who, for good reasons and bad, is highly 
vulnerable to this sort of attack. He is too young to be a figure of authority. 
His draft record denies him an image of protective strength. His way with words 
keeps him from being seen as a truth-teller. His sexual history makes him a 
poor model of traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters, conditioned by years of post-Watergate high dudgeon, now think about 
such things. And the more a voter is sensitive to these concerns, the more 
likely he or she is to feel not just disenchantment but real distaste. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, some journalists have begun to worry that the 
sensational news might be having a corrosive effect on our institutions and our 
leaders' ability to govern. But the worriers are too late. The corrosion is 
advanced; we are reaping the whirlwind. The new campaign mores give everyone an 
incentive to milk moral issues for all they are worth, and it will be a long 
time before politicians can retreat from their current posture of mutual 
assured destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 What will happen sooner is a continuing decline in the effectiveness of 
government. This prospect may not be so alarming; ours will not be the first 
era when the federal government was more marginal than central to the country's 
public life and politics. In such times, there is still public business to be 
done, but it is done in other ways. Now, for instance, health-care reform has 
failed nationally but is alive in the states. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way, the quality of federal officials may suffer as politics 
becomes more unpleasant, and ambitious young people go elsewhere. But their 
talents will not evaporate; they will just be put to a different use. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe the thing to do about the current political churlishness is to relax. 
Don't think of it as a process likely to cost us our best national officials. 
Think of it as a way of producing more and better teachers, business 
executives, clergymen, civic leaders and other types who, when they want to do 
something public-spirited, will most likely do it close to home.*

AFTER ALL THE NEGATIVITY, WILL THE VICTORS BE ABLE TO GOVERN CALIFORNIA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Opinion, is a senior associate at the Center for Politics and Economics at

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the campaign that truth forgot spins to a close, it's becoming clear that 
the slash-and-trash politics of 1994 will make it extraordinarily difficult for 
the victors to govern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this election season, the mood of Californians has been sour. A 
recent Los Angeles Times poll showed that two-thirds of voters surveyed think 
the state is on the wrong track. Only 27% said it is headed in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter antagonism toward government and the politicians who run it was high 
even before the flood of negative campaign ads hit. A national poll taken by 
Times Mirror Corp. earlier this fall, and a more recent Orange County survey 
conducted by UC Irvine researcher Mark Baldassare, depict an electorate that is 
rootless, self-absorbed, hostile toward the poor and social-welfare programs. 
And the campaign has only heightened that surly mood. 
</P>
<P>
 This has been the most poll-driven election campaign in memory. Anger, fear 
and divisiveness are its currency -- and Californians are buying. And 
governance could be a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Governing -- shaping public policy -- requires consensus. Reaching consensus, 
inevitably the product of compromise, requires that elected leaders and 
constituents have confidence in each other, trust each other. The rhetoric of 
this campaign has hardly inspired such trust. 
</P>
<P>
 In her ads and on the hustings, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown has repeatedly 
branded Gov. Pete Wilson a liar. In turn, Wilson has impugned Brown's 
consistency and integrity. It's not surprising that voters, already disdainful 
of government by "sleazy politicians," don't like either candidate much. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite the truly mean tone of the gubernatorial campaign, some 
discussion of policy has slipped past the strident and negative ads. The U.S. 
Senate campaign is another matter. It has seldom moved beyond character 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad. California voters have been denied the opportunity to participate in 
a clear-cut referendum on the direction they want government to take. A real 
choice between two quite different philosophies of governance has been buried 
under layers of mean-spirited charge and countercharge. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, voters find themselves faced with a Hobson's choice. Do they vote 
for an incumbent whom Mike Huffington tarred as "a senator who serves special 
interests -- and her own"? Or for a challenger whom Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
labeled as "secretive, threatening and greedy . . . the Texas oil millionaire 
Californians just can't trust"? 
</P>
<P>
 If Californians return Feinstein to Washington, might they view every one of 
her future votes skeptically -- as just another "special interest" payoff? If 
Huffington replaces her, might he find himself a pariah in the Capitol, his 
motives and actions continually questioned by constituents and colleagues? In 
either case, California is the loser. 
</P>
<P>
 The fallout from the debate over Proposition 187 underscores the risks to 
governance inherent in crafting political support from anger, fear and 
distrust. Arguing against the initiative, which would deny most government 
services to illegal immigrants, hospital official David Langness told a Times 
reporter, "The overlay of civil disobedience, general confusion, lawsuits and 
uncertainty about how to apply the law will result in great chaos." Whether or 
not an exaggeration, such charged rhetoric serves to show how the 
anti-immigrant measure has further torn California's tattered social fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Race has been injected into a critical policy problem. Inevitably, that will 
make a solution to illegal immigration more difficult to achieve, regardless of 
the vote. Whether 187-supporter Wilson or 187-opponent Brown is the next 
governor, the state's chief executive will have to lead a California incapable 
of debating serious policy alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 So wide is the divisive net cast by the "Save Our State" initiative that the 
judiciary is almost certain to find its own reputation, already under a cloud, 
on the line if the measure passes. Opponents of 187 are primed to challenge the 
proposition's legality in court, and whatever the ruling, a lot of people's 
suspicions, mostly negative, about the system's ability to deliver justice will 
be confirmed. And voters who viewed Proposition 187 as a means to grab control 
of the policy process away from unresponsive politicians may find their will 
thwarted and their anger unassuaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The barrage of negative campaigning has meant something else this election 
year. When Californians vote on candidates to fill lower, state constitutional 
offices, they are, in effect, creating the leadership bench for the major 
parties. Because candidates in down-ballot races are usually inadequately 
funded and are virtually ignored by the media, voters seldom know much about 
them -- beyond ballot title and party affiliation. This year, voters not only 
face uninformed choices -- they have been pitched false choices. 
</P>
<P>
 If you catch the last-minute ads being aired by some candidates in down-ballot 
races, you could assume that the lieutenant governor, schools chief, secretary 
of state and insurance commissioner all have major crime-fighting 
responsibilities. If Californians cared enough to learn exactly what these 
hucksters do -- and cannot do -- after they take office, they would likely 
become even more contemptuous of politicians' promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Up and down the ballot, the real issues in Tuesday's election have been swept 
away by political mudslides. And it is representative government, and 
California's future, that may wind up being buried underneath the debris.*

THE SEARCH FOR A NEW POLITICAL CENTER; LOOKING TO '96, BOTH PARTIES SHOULD SEEK 
AN OXYMORON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Elections have a way of changing the political landscape. No matter what 
happens Tuesday, the old conventional wisdom about 1996 will be dead. The 1996 
players will be sifting through the returns to find new wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest player is, of course, President Bill Clinton. On Nov. 9, Clinton 
will either be the Comeback Kid or the Angel of Doom. He'll look good if the 
Democrats' losses are about average for the President's party in a midterm -- 
three or four Senate seats, 20-25 House seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would average losses be terrific news for the President? Because the 
Republicans have set him up for it. They've been fantasizing about a 
revolution. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole! House Speaker Newt Gingrich! To 
the barricades! 
</P>
<P>
 It could happen. But it's a reach. And if it doesn't happen, Clinton will look 
like a hero. After all, every Republican is running against him. So every 
Democratic victory will be a Clinton save. He'll be resurrected in the 
Democratic Party and a sure bet for renomination in '96. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Democrats lose control of the House, however, all bets are off. The 
party will have lost the power base it has held in Washington for 40 years. The 
long knives will come out -- aimed at Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats will be terrified of running with Clinton at the top of the ticket 
in '96. If Democrats do poorly in states with large black populations, like New 
York, Illinois and Georgia, Jesse Jackson will have a ready explanation: 
Clinton moved too far to the center and never delivered for urban voters and 
minorities. If Democrats get wiped out among Southern white voters, moderate 
Democrats like Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia will have a ready explanation: Clinton 
moved too far to the left and never kept his pledge to govern as a new 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Party elders will warn Clinton that if he runs for renomination, primary 
challenges will materialize and he'll split the Democratic Party. Suppose he 
runs, anyway. Will he get the nomination? Probably. No incumbent President has 
ever been denied renomination by his own party, though it almost happened to 
Gerald R. Ford in 1976 and Jimmy Carter in 1980. Ford and Carter got 
renominated, but were fatally wounded for the general election. Clinton would 
be too. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side, two senators have a great deal at stake in seeing the 
GOP win a Senate majority next week. One is Dole, who would become majority 
leader. But could Dole then run for President? Not without difficulty. He would 
assume the majority leadership in January, just in time to start raising money 
for his presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial 
Committee, has an even bigger stake in the Senate outcome. He could take credit 
for engineering a GOP majority. But he wouldn't have to run it. A perfect 
platform on which to run for President. 
</P>
<P>
 For other Republicans, 1994 will be a test of strength between two rising 
wings of the GOP. The party's moderate wing would be strengthened by wins for 
governor in Massachusetts, New York, Illinois and California. Massachusetts 
Gov. William F. Weld is headed for a big reelection victory. And New Hampshire 
is right next door. But Weld has to figure out how to make himself acceptable 
to the religious right, which opposes him on abortion and gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard M. Nixon's deathbed political prediction was that Gov. Pete Wilson 
would get reelected in California and go on to win the GOP presidential 
nomination. Wilson's reelection now seems likely. But he has to figure out how 
to make himself acceptable to conservatives, who will not easily forgive him 
for signing a record tax hike in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential candidate has a big stake in the California outcome -- Jack 
Kemp. He's for Wilson and against Proposition 187, the anti-illegal-immigration 
initiative that Wilson is running on. Kemp had better hope Wilson wins. If 
Wilson loses, whatever the outcome on Proposition 187, Republicans will never 
forgive Kemp for sabotaging a fellow Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Quayle will be looking for a religious-right surge at the polls on 
Tuesday. He's aiming to become their favorite son. In fact, this election poses 
several tests of strength for the religious right -- especially Oliver L. 
North's race for senator from Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the election of North be good news for Quayle or any other potential GOP 
contender? North is not about to share the spotlight with anyone. If he got 
elected, North would immediately become a national hero to the right. To 
conservatives, North is red meat. Quayle is thin gruel. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives' ultimate fantasy is to go to bed Tuesday night knowing that 
Edward M. Kennedy is out of the Senate, Mario M. Cuomo is out of the Albany 
statehouse, Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) is out of the speakership, and North is 
going to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it happen? The Republican base is mobilized. They're coming out to vote 
against Clinton, against Congress, against liberals and against Democrats. The 
Democratic base -- urban voters, liberals and minorities -- is demoralized. 
Polls show a lot of them may stay home. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, they're disappointed in Clinton. He hasn't delivered for them. 
He proposed comprehensive health-care reform, an economic-stimulus program, a 
broad-based energy tax, gays in the military, C. Lani Guinier in the Justice 
Department and big, new crime-prevention spending. Those proposals enraged 
conservatives. But he didn't deliver on any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the Administration's current agenda? Welfare reform, modest health-care 
reforms, deficit reduction and campaign reform. Those issues do not get 
Democrats to stand up and cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic candidates are sensing a GOP tidal wave. So they're running as fast 
as they can to the center, positioning themselves as tough on crime, 
anti-spending, anti-tax and anti-government. That doesn't do much to drive up 
Democrats' enthusiasm, either. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Democrats don't see much to vote for. So last week, the President 
shifted gears and started talking about what Democrats should vote against. The 
President is warning that if the Republicans take over Congress, they'll cut 
Social Security, student loans, veterans' benefits and anti-poverty programs. 
The Democrats have put out a poster showing who would be in charge of a 
Republican Congress: Senate Majority Leader Dole, Banking Chairman Alfonse M. 
D'Amato, Foreign Affairs Chairman Jesse Helms and Speaker Gingrich. Happy 
Halloween! 
</P>
<P>
 That's why this is such a negative campaign. Democrats are running on fear. 
Republicans are running on anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parties must indulge in oxymoronic thinking. No, an oxymoron is not what 
candidates call each other in attack ads. It's a contradiction in terms -- like 
"jumbo shrimp" or "working vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 years, Democrats have been trying to find a tough liberal. Is that an 
oxymoron? Not really. Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson 
were big-government liberals. But they were also tough guys. They made things 
happen. Defy them, and you paid a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Johnson, Democrats have had a problem finding tough liberals. Hubert H. 
Humphrey? Not his own man. George McGovern? One thousand percent behind his 
running mate. Walter F. Mondale? The candidate of the special interests. 
Michael S. Dukakis? He got beaten up by the wimp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats managed to elect Jimmy Carter because, after Watergate, the 
country was looking for a preacher. They elected one and discovered he wasn't 
tough enough for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton looked tough in 1992. He faced down the press in the Gennifer Flowers 
and draft-letter controversies. He stood up to Jackson in the Sistah Souljah 
affair. Since taking office, however, Clinton's image as "tough enough for the 
job" has deteriorated, according to the Gallup poll. Critics say Clinton has 
been too eager to please, too willing to compromise. His opponents, foreign and 
domestic, have taken advantage of him. 
</P>
<P>
 The impression of weakness invites aggression. It happened to Kuwait. It 
happened to Bosnia. And it happened to Clinton. At the end of the last 
Congress, his enemies overran him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedyism means tough liberalism. In the '70s, Democrats longed for another 
Kennedy to come and save them. But Ted Kennedy proved to be a flawed candidate. 
In the '80s, Democrats saw Cuomo as their savior -- a tough, compassionate, 
street-smart liberal. Italian-American. Tough. But Cuomo declined to run in 
1992. Now he's fighting to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans need an oxymoron to solve their problem, too. Opposition to 
Clinton has energized the GOP. But it has also brutalized it. Nastiness is 
turning off some Republicans and splitting the GOP. In Pennsylvania, Teresa 
Heinz, widow of the late Republican Sen. John Heinz, called the GOP candidate 
running for her husband's seat part of a "worrisome breed of politicians who 
mock, belittle and vilify those who disagree with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans need to find a nice conservative. Is that an oxymoron? Not really. 
Ronald Reagan was a nice conservative. And it saved him. Reagan could say 
harsh, divisive things. But the voters were confident he wouldn't blow up the 
world or throw old people out in the snow. But with Dole or Gingrich or D'Amato 
or Gramm -- well, you never know. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the Republicans find a nice conservative for 1996? Kemp qualifies. He has 
attacked Proposition 187 as a racist and nativist measure, not in the tradition 
of the party of Abraham Lincoln. Kemp's problem is that conservatives may not 
trust him. If he's so nice, they ask, can he really be a conservative? 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lesson in this year's election for both parties. Clinton has to 
toughen up his act and show his opponents they cannot defy him with impunity. 
Republicans have to stop being so mean all the time. Two years of a nasty, 
aggressive, Republican Congress running roughshod over a weak, ineffectual 
Democratic President won't do either side any good.*

THE NATION; THE CHILDREN'S CAMPAIGN: WHEN EMOTIONALISM MASKS HARD CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Heilemann, John Heilemann is Washington correspondent for the 
Economist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In campaign after campaign this year, the only thing trendier than trashing 
Washington was the Save the Children Fund's trademark necktie. Dave McCurdy, 
the moderate Democratic Senate candidate in Oklahoma, sports one. So does 
Michael DeWine, the conservative Republican running in Ohio. Bill Clinton says 
it's one of his favorites. Once worn only by the terminally PC, the tie -- with 
its multicolored swarm of smiling kids -- has spread like some sartorial virus, 
sprouting from the collars of candidates of every ideological stripe. 
</P>
<P>
 Empty symbols are, no doubt, as common in political races as bad food and 
baseless accusations. And candidates have always labored mightily to display 
fondness for their children -- and their spouses and their pets -- as a sign of 
their decency. In Washington state, the political neophyte trying to unseat 
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley goes so far as to count the fact that Foley is 
not a father as one reason he should be ousted. 
</P>
<P>
 But this fall, politicians across the country have taken the infantilization 
of politics a step farther. Candidates are now trying to turn every topic under 
the sun -- from crime to welfare to the economy -- into a "children's issue." 
</P>
<P>
 This tactic serves different ends for each party. Yet, they are up to the same 
thing: softening the edges of a campaign that has been unrelentingly harsh. 
With a sullen electorate harboring serious misgivings about Democrats and 
Republicans alike, the parties are using emotionalism about children to ease 
voters' minds -- and to obscure both the issues and what they really believe 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Injecting kids into any political debate comes naturally to Democrats, who 
have always been more comfortable when it comes to the touchy and the feelly. 
But when old-style liberalism is constantly being challenged by more 
hard-headed approaches, couching any number of issues in terms of the 
well-being of children is about more than affirming the party's commitment to 
society's weakest members. It's about trying to advance the agendas of a range 
of traditional but now unfashionable Democratic constituencies -- minorities, 
the poor, environmentalists, big spenders -- without ever mentioning them by 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 As the New Republic's Mickey Kaus has pointed out, the master of this art is 
Marian Wright Edelman, whose Children's Defense Fund has gained great influence 
by pitching poverty policy as a contest between helpless tots and those who 
would sacrifice their interests. In Massachusetts last month, you could hear 
Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy pushing a similar line: Taxing the rich was 
not a matter of class or redistribution, but of fairness to "future 
generations." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just paleoliberal Democrats doing this. Out west, market-minded 
neoliberals like Gov. Roy Romer (D-Colo.) frame the environmental debate as a 
contest between "shortsighted" development and "a livable planet for our 
children." And from coast to coast, Democrats such as McCurdy have portrayed 
the difference between the parties on economic policy as one of tax breaks for 
the rich versus "investing in our children's future." Sometimes such rhetoric 
is almost honest; more often it's a way of making tough choices sound obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican strategy is more schizophrenic. On issues where the party is 
united -- typically those where a hard-edged message appeals to voter fears -- 
the kids that get talked about are threatening teen-agers. In Texas, the 
gubernatorial campaign being waged by George W. Bush has, like those of many 
other Republicans, revolved largely around promises to get tough on law and 
order. Bush's trouble is that Gov. Ann Richards has built more jail cells than 
all her predecessors combined; and, as elsewhere, the crime rate is falling. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. Bush and other Republicans argue that what matters is juvenile 
crime, and that is rising. Maybe -- statistics are unclear. But suppose it's 
true. You might think that a candidate forever shouting about youth crime would 
offer policies designed to deal specifically with it. Wrong. Instead, 
Republicans pledge to build more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of voters like the sound of that. But they are not so sure about the 
areas where many Republicans are drifting to the right. So out comes the 
child-friendly rhetoric to smooth over harsh surfaces to make the party's "big 
tent" even bigger. Heard that the GOP's "Contract With America" offers tax cuts 
for the wealthy? Don't worry: The biggest is a per-child tax credit to 
"strengthen the family," so it must be progressive. Uneasy about remarks like 
that of McCurdy's religious-right opponent, James M. Inhofe, calling for a 
"moral revolution"? Fear not: He just wants to make America "a decent place for 
all God's children." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere have the two parties' penchants for rhetorical child abuse been so 
vivid as over another hot campaign topic: welfare. Here, Democrats who are 
queasy about Clinton's plan to put a two-year limit on cash assistance argue 
that welfare is a safety net for poor children, and that cutting off checks 
threatens to hurt those the program is designed to protect. Republicans counter 
that they, too, are worried about kids. But no system, they say, could be more 
damaging to children than the current one. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are being evasive. Since the 1960s, the debate has raged over 
whether welfare fosters dependency and encourages single parenthood. Treating 
welfare as a children's issue ignores these vital points. But if conservatives 
are really worried about poor kids, their proposals -- especially those of 
people such as Charles Murray, who want to abolish welfare entirely -- seem 
risky. The suspicion lingers that many Republicans are, in fact, more concerned 
with how the "undeserving poor" behave than with the well-being of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare reform will be among Congress' main bits of business next year. But 
lest anyone get their hopes too high that the terms of the debate will be less 
child-centric (i.e., more honest) outside the fevered realm of the fall 
campaigns, remember health care. In late July, Hillary Rodham Clinton launched 
the last push for sweeping reform by reading a letter from 8-year-old Jennifer 
Dawn Lucas, who had trouble getting insurance because she was born with a hole 
in her heart. "I don't want our country to have a hole in its heart anymore," 
implored the First Lady, "when it comes to taking care of sick children like 
Jennifer." 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, Hillary Clinton's crusade for universal coverage was over, and 
her main allies, led by Sen. Harris Wofford (D-Pa.), had changed tack. Three 
years earlier, Wofford had propelled health care to the top of the agenda by 
telling voters that if every criminal has the right to a lawyer, every American 
should have the right to a doctor. Now he was pushing a plan to provide 
universal coverage just for "the most vulnerable: our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Who could disagree? There was, however, one small drawback to the "kids first" 
plan: It would have done next to nothing about the health-care crisis. The real 
problem, after all, has little to do with children and everything to do with 
America spending twice as much (as a percentage of gross domestic product) on 
health care as any other wealthy nation, yet still not covering all its people. 
Sadly, this fact was consistently drowned out by the flood of tales of "the 
most vulnerable" -- like Jennifer Dawn Lucas.  
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that health care -- like welfare or crime -- is an adult issue. 
Of course, children are "the country's future;" of course, most policies we 
implement today will affect their lives tomorrow. But these policies must 
indeed be adopted today, and suffusing every debate with emotionalism about 
children obscures not only the hard choices that need to be made, but what each 
party thinks about making them. As long as that continues, much of the national 
debate (such as it is) will be a charade -- and a childish one at that.*

THE WORLD; FOR THE OAS, 50 YEARS OF IRRELEVANCY MAY BE OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

studies program at the Brookings Institution. He has traveled extensively 
throughout Latin America. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last March, the Organization of American States resembled a boxing ring more 
than an arena for hemispheric cooperation. Bernd Niehaus, Costa Rica's foreign 
minister, was a shoe-in for the organization's highest office. Until the 
hemisphere's heavyweights -- the United States, Brazil and Mexico -- put up 
Cesar Gaviria, then president of Colombia, who has considerably more stature 
than the relatively unknown Costa Rican. A fight broke out between the 
heavyweights and featherweights -- the Central American and Caribbean states 
that backed the Costa Rican. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavyweights, at a distinct disadvantage, leaned on the smaller states to 
support Gaviria. Yet, the featherweight coalition of 20 votes -- of a total of 
34 -- held firm. Finally, in a last-ditch effort, Gaviria dispatched his 
foreign minister to the arena, armed with free-trade agreements with Colombia 
for swing voters. The OAS elected Gaviria to a five-year term as its secretary 
general. Its smaller members cried foul, resenting the continued dominance of 
the heavyweights in hemispheric relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the United Nations, the OAS is mapping its way through the uncertain 
landscape of the post-Cold War era, made all the more difficult because the 
regional organization has been largely irrelevant for most of its half-century 
existence. Nevertheless, the fight over the secretary-general post augurs well 
for the OAS and for regional cooperation: the heavyweights are finally taking 
the organization seriously, at least as a potential arena for cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the OAS, the United States wields a double-edged sword. When it wants 
to, it can -- and does -- dominate the institution. In finances alone, the 
United States contributes nearly 60% of the general budget, thus controlling 
the purse strings. It also holds de facto veto power: When the organization 
acts contrary to its interests, Washington tends to walk away, creating a 
vacuum in its wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Multinational organizations built on the principles of juridical equality do 
not operate effectively when dominated by one member. In such cases, other 
members tend to unite to restrain the dominant member. Practically speaking, 
U.S. domination has spurred other OAS members to restrict its action, 
preferring non-intervention over collective action to solve regional problems 
like drug trafficking and refugee flows. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, the OAS suffers most when its largest member ignores it. The 
organization nearly went bankrupt when U.S. payments fell into arrears in the 
1980s. Also, when Washington is distracted by world events, it indifferently 
carries out its obligations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 But the United States has increasingly shown a willingness to work with 
multinational organizations in dealing with international problems. Ambassador 
Harriet C. Babbitt, the Clinton Administration's representative to the OAS, 
says the U.S. commitment to use the organization is "much greater than ever 
before." Indeed, the United States has convened a meeting of all the heads of 
state in the region, excluding Cuba, for the first time in more than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In his inaugural address -- delivered on the same day that President Bill 
Clinton announced his intention to invade Haiti in order to restore democracy 
-- Gaviria asserted that the strengthening of democracy in the hemisphere is 
the major topic on the inter-American agenda. The convergence of opinion was 
not coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
 The spread of democracy is a prominent feature of the post-Cold War era. In 
Latin America, formal democracy has been restored in every country except Cuba. 
The expansion of democratic institutions does not mean, however, that democracy 
has taken root in the region. Quite the contrary. The Chiapas revolt in Mexico 
signals an uncertain future for emerging democracies. The OAS, attuned to the 
difficulties of the self-governing task, is establishing mechanisms to 
strengthen democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 OAS members approved a resolution automatically convening a meeting of foreign 
ministers to decide upon a collective course of action in the event of a coup 
or other interruption of democratic government within any member state. The 
Santiago resolution, as it is known, is the first OAS sanction of collective 
action to intervene in the domestic affairs of a member country. 
</P>
<P>
 Force as a means of ousting an undemocratic regime will most likely remain 
unacceptable to the majority of OAS members. Not only is force risky and 
costly, but it also breaches the staunchly guarded sovereignty of member 
states. In its stead, the organization advocates the use of preemptive measures 
-- such as expanded use of mediation and election monitoring -- to promote 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War has brought forth a world characterized by 
uncertainty. We can be certain, however, that the world remains multilateral 
and increasingly interdependent. If a new world order is going to arise, it 
will have to be on a multilateral basis; it will have to seek common values and 
goals, and it will have to include cooperation across borders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Western Hemisphere, the OAS offers an unrivaled forum for cooperation. 
Even if imperfect, it is the only arena in which all the countries of the 
hemisphere, in good standing, can meet to discuss regional policy and mutual 
problems. In so doing, the OAS facilitates productive exchange and cooperation 
on common problems. 
</P>
<P>
 We can also be certain that U.S. involvement is essential to hemispheric 
cooperation. Our regional partners have responded to the changes in the world 
by looking north, and much depends on U.S. action. Gaviria's election in the 
OAS demonstrates that the Adminstration is taking the OAS seriously as a forum 
in which to pursue its interests. Preparations for the historic hemisphere 
meeting, to be held in Miami next month, should not overlook the benefits the 
OAS can offer in expanding cooperation. The United States needs to acknowledge 
the needs of other members and fully cooperate, on the multilateral level, to 
pursue its own interests in a new world.*

THE WORLD; ANOTHER CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT IN ANGOLA -- AND AFRICA'S LONGEST WAR 
RAGES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Adonis E. Hoffman, Adonis E. Hoffman, a senior associate at the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace, is former director of the Africa 
subcommittee in the House of Representatives. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peace in the Middle East. Rapprochement on the Korean peninsula. Democracy in 
South Africa. At a time when many of the world's major conflicts are nearing 
negotiation, if not resolution, Angola's 19-year civil war, Africa's longest, 
stands apart. On Oct. 17, the government of Angola and its chief rival 
announced that they had, yet again, reached an agreement in principle to end 
the fighting. Still, the conflict rages virtually unabated, despite a U.N. 
Security Council demand that all military operations cease. 
</P>
<P>
 Angola's post-colonial history is littered with a long line of accords, 
agree-ments, cease-fires, protocols and treaties brokered by the United 
Nations, the Organization of African Unity and interested countries like the 
United States and Portugal. The treaties bear the exotic names of their venues 
-- the Alvor and Nakuru agreements, the Nkomati and Lusaka accords, the 
Gbadolite, Bicesse and the Sao Tome summits, to name a few -- and have been 
broken, in whole or part, by both parties to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is something more insidious operating in Angola: a deep enmity among 
Angolans based on ethnicity and ideology. Historically, these divisions were 
first exploited by the slave traders, then by the colonizers, and most recently 
by Cold War powers. Today, Angolans themselves propagate their own disunity. No 
party brings clean hands to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 The war began in 1975, shortly after a defeated Portuguese government ceded 
power to a tripartite alliance of indigenous liberation movements: the Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), supported by the intellectual 
elite of Luanda, Angola's capital, and the Kimbundu peoples of northwestern 
Angola; the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), backed by the 
Bakongo peoples of northeastern Angola, and the National Union for the Total 
Liberation of Angola (UNITA), favored by the mostly peasant population of the 
Ovimbundu people of central and southern Angola. 
</P>
<P>
 The three liberation movements signed a joint agreement at Alvor, Portugal, to 
build a "just and democratic society in Angola." But a month later, fighting 
erupted between two of the movements. Depending on its ideology, each group 
sought and received international support. The Soviet Union -- and, later, Cuba 
-- sent troops to support the MPLA. China and South Africa lined up behind 
UNITA. The United States began its involvement in 1975, when it opened an 
office in Luanda to coordinate military assistance to the FNLA, whose members 
soon scattered into either the MPLA or UNITA. As each faction received support 
from abroad, each renewed its claim to run the government and demanded 
international recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1970s, most European countries recognized the MPLA as Angola's 
government, and by 1979, when President Jose Eduardo dos Santos assumed office, 
it began offering economic incentives to foreign companies to invest in the 
country, especially in its petroleum industry. Ironically, the regime was 
moving closer to East European communists even as it courted capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 1980s until recently, relations between the United States and Angola 
were strained because of U.S. support for UNITA. In 1985, Congress, at 
President Ronald Reagan's behest, repealed the Clark Amendment, which, since 
1976, had prohibited U.S. military assistance to UNITA. This allowed for the 
free flow of arms and support to UNITA while barring the U.S. government from 
buying Angolan oil. Paradoxically, Gulf Oil, one of America's largest petroleum 
companies, continued to operate in Angola's Cabinda province, providing the 
MPLA regime with much-needed hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, with the military conflict a standoff, talks among Cuba, Angola and 
South Africa led to a settlement in which the fates of Angola and Namibia were 
diplomatically linked. Namibia won its independence in 1990, but the Angolan 
conflict remained unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of on-again, off-again talks, the MPLA and UNITA reached a 
ease-fire agreement in the spring of 1991. Timetables and a framework for 
elections were established. A joint political-military commission, composed of 
representatives from the MPLA, UNITA, Portugal, Russia and the United States, 
was set up. National elections were scheduled in September, 1992, to be 
conducted under U.N. auspices. A new consolidated army was to be assembled by 
the end of that year. In the interim, the MPLA government legalized opposition 
parties. By all outward appearances, the dream of democracy seemed closer to 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 But the election results, though declared essentially free and fair, were 
disputed. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, UNITA's candidate, demanded a recount after a 
preliminary tally showed him trailing. Although Savimbi was operating within 
the rules of the agreement, the MPLA government denied his request. UNITA 
withdrew its forces from the combined army. Soon, hostilities erupted again. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1993, negotiations resumed in Lusaka, under the shepherding of 
U.N. Special Representative Alioune Beye, and culminated in last month's 
agreement. Under normal circumstances, a negotiated settlement should be cause 
for celebration. But nothing about the Angolan situation is normal. Angolans 
appreciate the danger in premature optimism. Their country holds the inglorious 
distinction of having the world's largest population of amputees, thanks to the 
profligate use of land mines by both sides during the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angolan conflict is to be resolved and the Lusaka peace accord to 
endure, the United States must use its leverage with Angolans to promote the 
principle and spirit of reconciliation. This means actively opposing 11th-hour 
military efforts to gain advantages at the negotiating table. Despite the 
Clinton Administration's support for the MPLA government, it is clear that 
Angola will not have peace unless and until Savimbi's UNITA is given a 
meaningful role in the governance of the country. According to reliable 
estimates, UNITA controls anywhere from 25% to 40% of Angola and is strongly 
supported by one-third of the country's citizens. Disenfranchising such a 
significant opposition would dispel any hope for federalism or proportional 
government, and, in the long run, would be a recipe for more killing and 
bloodshed.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; LOWELL WEICKER; AN INDEPENDENT POLITICIAN AT A 
HIGHLY PARTISAN TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sara Fritz, Sara Fritz is a national correspondent for The Times. She 
interviewed Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in his office at the state capital. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before he bolted the GOP to be elected governor of Connecticut as a 
third-party candidate in 1990, Lowell P. Weicker Jr. had a reputation as a 
maverick politician with a keen intellect, an acerbic tongue and an unusual 
willingness to take unpopular stands. Indeed, Weicker has always taken pride in 
being the antithesis of the slick, media-savvy politician. 
</P>
<P>
 A giant of a man who stands 6-feet-6 inches tall and lumbers through life like 
the proverbial bull in the china shop, Weicker is known to his friends and 
enemies alike as both arrogant and highly principled. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of Congress for 20 years, before being defeated in 1988, he often 
took stands that set him apart from most of his colleagues in the Republican 
Party. He spoke out in favor of abortion rights. He was arrested on the front 
steps of the South African Embassy in Washington for protesting apartheid. And 
as a member of the Senate Watergate Committee, he was one of the first 
Republicans to find fault with then-President Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, as governor and founder of A Connecticut Party, Weicker succeeded in 
setting the state's finances straight by doing what for most politicians would 
have been an act of political suicide: imposing a state income tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Weicker's personality and political record have made him 
highly controversial. While held in high esteem in some quarters, it is not 
surprising that Weicker is portrayed as a villain by many of his constituents 
-- particularly conservative Republicans whose views he has consistently 
challenged. Weicker, in fact, seems to enjoy the vilification. As he sees it, 
hostility to his brand of politics is evidence that voters do not really 
appreciate the kind of principled leadership they claim to want. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 63, Weicker will be leaving public life in January. Although he entered 
politics with inherited family wealth, he now says a lifetime of service in 
low-paying elected offices has depleted his financial resources. As a private 
citizen, Weicker says he plans to do three things: make money, have fun and 
spend more time with his wife, five children and two stepchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Weicker, whose success in getting elected in Connecticut has 
inspired other independent efforts across the nation, is suspected of nurturing 
a secret desire to run for President in 1996 -- as a national third-party 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: As the election approaches, there has been a lot of hand-wringing 
about the deterioration of political discourse and leadership in this country. 
How do you view the state of politics?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think democracy is working as it should -- which is to say that the 
politicians are reflecting the views of their constituents. I do not belong to 
the school that there's Washington out there, and there's us back here. I think 
the people of America do not want decisions; they don't want the tough news or 
the bad news. They sort of want to coast along, and the net result is that the 
politicians are coasting along and the parties are coasting along. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize this puts a somewhat reverse twist on everybody saying, "Gee, you 
know, we're looking for the right people in Washington." But the fact is that 
finger-to-the-wind politics, which never solves any problem, is creating 
finger-to-the-wind government, so that the most difficult problems are never 
resolved and we get increasingly frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, the American people have now accorded their highest honors to 
those politicians who don't stand for anything. And the net result, as far as 
the system is concerned, is we have gone from a politics of accountability to a 
politics of electability or reelect-ability. And that just does not work, 
because, very frankly, the realities of both opportunity and the realities of 
the problems don't yield to easy political solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Hasn't finger-to-the-wind politics always been a problem?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think of my first important national election, i.e., when I ran for 
Congress in 1968, and I ran against an incumbent Democrat, Donald Irwin. Irwin 
was a Johnson, pro-war, pro-Vietnam War Democrat. That was his position. I took 
the position we should be out of there. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of us knew that we were going to live or die on our position. That was 
going to decide the election. And it did. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not politics today. The idea today is to fuzz it up as to where you 
stand on the issue. And that's where the shift has come. I increasingly saw it 
when I was in Washington, as both the Republicans and Democrats would get 
together, sort of, on consensus solutions to deficit reduction that were 
meaningless. But they felt they didn't want to rock the boat too much before an 
election and, therefore, it wouldn't become an issue. And it didn't become an 
issue and, consequently, it didn't become executive and legislative action 
after the election was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there a solution to this problem?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it'll come to pass with the emergence of a third party, or maybe 
more than that. But at least a third to give competition to the other two. It's 
amazing that we have deregulated everything in the United States of America 
that's economic. The only thing we haven't deregulated is politics. We left it 
as a duopoly, or a monopoly, and it suffers all the ills of any monopoly. In 
the case of the economics, of course, it's high prices and bad products. In the 
case of politics, it's bad ideas and bad candidates. So I think that that's the 
way this thing is going to correct itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where do you see a national third party coming from?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It is already taking place at the lower levels of government, i.e., in 
local elections and state elections. I realize that what's probably running 
through your mind -- and everyone else's mind -- is that we already have it 
nationally in terms of Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's an aberration. It hasn't come to pass nationally. I think, 
especially in politics, everything builds from the ground up, and it's building 
now and, someday, you'll end up with a true centrist third party. Don't forget 
Perot's just an individual out there. There's no party. But I'm talking about 
in a party sense -- that would develop into a centrist third party. We've had a 
lot of other parties running at the national level, but never all-encompassing 
as far as the issues are concerned -- more centrist in addressing these issues. 
That's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: First as a moderate Republican, then as a third-party politician, you've 
had a unusual perspective on partisan politics. How has the dynamic between the 
two parties changed?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think that you certainly have more attacks on the individual. That's not 
to say the parties didn't used to lock horns on issues and philosophies, but 
the personal aspects of politics have certainly not changed for the better. 
It's the substitution of ignorance and name calling for intelligent debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, I have to say that I do not exonerate the American people. They all sit 
there and say, "Oh, that's just horrible, those negative ads." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, let's face it, they follow those negative ads and they act on those 
negatives. The price of this is that good people are not going to go into 
politics. Who wants to dive into a mud bath? And that's what you're asking 
people to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are the two parties entirely to blame?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The media has to take it's share of responsibility. You have gone -- I say 
that in the editorial sense -- from a precise profession to a tabloid 
profession. And that has changed the tenor of everything. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, suppose I say my press secretary kisses cows. The media used to 
say, "All right, senator, let's see the proof here. We're not printing anything 
like that. Show us." In other words, show us the pictures, show us the 
evidence, show us the testimony where he kisses cows. Nowadays, if I say that, 
it's up to him to prove that he doesn't. The media don't always demand the 
accountability of the politician as it used to. Indeed, they sort of revel in 
the more sensational and salacious of the accusations, the more it sort of 
sloshes around down there with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Look, you know why the personal stuff has all of a sudden come to the fore. 
It's very, very easy. This monster called television needs material. And if the 
material is free, that's great -- because they've got bottom lines; they're not 
philanthropic organizations. They've got to show a profit. So the more free 
material they get, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see the Republican Party continuing to move to the right?  
</P>
<P>
 A: You can't spend, you know, 28 years in the party like I did and still not 
have an affection for it. And I still hope that the Republicans succeed, but 
not on the basis of where they stand now. Hopefully, they'll come back to the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 I take heart when I see a man like Rudy Giuliani. I wasn't for Giuliani to 
become mayor of New York City. He was too conservative. But I think he's doing 
an outstanding job. The force of his constituency that he is trying to serve 
dictates that he can't take stands way the hell off the road into the bush. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's never been a comfortable factor for the Republican Party. Witness 
Lowell Weicker, Jack Javits, Cliff Case, Ed Brook. I could go down the whole 
checklist of men that represented very difficult Democratic constituencies and 
eventually it was the Republican Party that did us all in. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Rep. Newt Gingrich says people in Washington are abnormal --  
</P>
<P>
 A: That certainly applies to Newt Gingrich more than anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: His point is that our leaders in Washington have lost touch.  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. No. They're very reflective of what's out here. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the American people are getting exactly what they want. What they want 
right now is nothing. They don't want change. . . . And then when we get into 
trouble, they blame Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you view President Clinton?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Whether you agree or disagree with President Clinton on many of his 
initiatives as to the details, the fact is, for the first time, this 
Administration is raising great issues to the level of national debate. So I 
admire the Administration -- we're talking health care, we're talking welfare 
reform, we're talking deficit reduction. I say agree or disagree -- but these 
are major issues that confront the nation, and they should be discussed. They 
should be voted on. And the minute anybody comes forth with a plan for change, 
everybody jumps all over it. It's not an easy task to lead. That is the problem 
right now. They get leadership; they don't want leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The American people eventually will understand that all this nonsense doesn't 
work and they'll then demand -- No. 1 -- leadership, and they'll demand that 
leadership do the things, as unpleasant as they are, to go ahead and put the 
nation back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: This year, a lot of wealthy men, like yourself, are running for office. 
Will they be any more independent, more willing to lead?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm not the guy to ask because I'm not independently wealthy. I'm broke. 
But rumor aside, let me just say one thing right now. Every time you try to 
effectuate any sort of a pay raise for public officials, God, all the editorial 
writers and the public have a field day. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm running, in the state of Connecticut, a $10-billion business. That's the 
budget of the state. I get paid $78,000. I mean, how ridiculous. I've not asked 
for a pay raise. But what about the brilliant young person who, let's say, has 
had a tough time coming up? Are you going to get them in public service for 
those kinds of prices? I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 For God's sake, pay the people who are in public office and it'll do two 
things. No. 1, it makes them independent of the special interests. No. 2, it is 
an attraction in terms of people able to serve and you have a far greater 
talent pool than just people that, as you say, are independently wealthy.*

 Thanks to Jenijoy La Belle for her paean to the Huntington Library and Art 
Gallery and her appreciation of the William Blake exhibit (Commentary, Oct 26). 
I, too, look on the Huntington as a "heaven on earth" and spend an afternoon 
whenever I can to refresh my mind and my spirit. It is truly a Southern

HOLDEN ON MURAL CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times printed articles concerning a controversial mural saluting the Black 
Panthers on Oct. 27 and Oct. 29. On Oct. 28, the Los Angeles City Council voted 
7-3 against a motion I brought up calling for the relocation of that mural, 
which had been planned for a wall at 11th and Jefferson. I want to publicly 
thank Councilmen Rudy Svorinich and Marvin Braude for voting with me on this 
important matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural is titled "To Protect and Serve" and it depicts the glorification of 
guns and also shows the Ku Klux Klan putting a noose around a black man's neck. 
It is inflammatory and negative and creates a hostile environment. It creates 
the impression that blacks have only two alternatives in life, as victims or 
vigilantes. We're not going to generate a city of love, a city of the angels, 
we're forging an atmosphere of anger and intimidation at a time when we need to 
unite the diverse community of Los Angeles. To illustrate my point, I said that 
we shouldn't yell fire in a crowded theater. To show our feelings opposing 
censorship would we allow a mural promoting Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, or any 
other hate group? We shouldn't be active participants in something that creates 
negative images and fosters antagonism in the community. It is especially the 
wrong message to send to young people who we hope will someday become 
productive citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 All 15 members of the City Council should reflect the needs and desires of our 
communities. What do our constituents want? What are they against? I took the 
responsible stand. I opposed glorifying violence and guns as a solution to 
oppression. The mural motto "To Protect and Serve" is a misnomer. It is a 
meaningful slogan of a city police department dedicated to helping the 
community and not a motto of vigilante justice.

KATHLEEN BROWN

<TEXT>
<P>
 We read Kathleen Brown's economic plan and were inspired, not "terrified," as 
the Hoover Institution team said we should be (Commentary, Nov. 1). Each of the 
32 boxes appearing throughout the book identifies a proposal which is enlarged 
upon in the text.It's easy to read but adequately detailed for its purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 We read a plan to take action to create jobs, break the cycle of violence, 
improve our schools and colleges, and stem the tide of illegal immigration. We 
read creative leadership proposals to get our economy moving, increase personal 
safety, and to fairly spread the necessary costs of infrastructure maintenance, 
job training, appropriate incarceration and services across all levels of 
government and the private sector. We read about a stimulus plan for business 
and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, we read a positive plan developed by an intelligent leader who sees 
a potential for goodness and worth in our society. We hope that she gets the 
chance to govern our state.

 * Brown is the supreme hypocrite for her opposition to Prop. 187. Her 
so-called economic plan, on Page 58, increases fines and penalties on 
businesses for the same requirements as in Prop. 187 for school and health care 
administrators, with no penalties! How come it's OK to lay a burden on 
businesses to check for illegal immigrant applicants, but not OK to lay the 
same requirements on school and health care administrators?  
</P>
<P>
 She and others disparaged Gov. Pete Wilson's comment about an identification 
card, but on Page 57 of her booklet, she proposes creating a "tamper-proof" 
Social Security card. So what's the difference? All we have to do is read 
what's written to see how shallow her debate is.

QUACKENBUSH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prop. 103's Harvey Rosenfield ("Insurers Mount a Stealth Campaign," 
Commentary, Nov. 2) wants readers to believe that there is something wrong 
about supporting a political candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing "stealth" about the insurance industry's support of 
Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush for insurance commissioner.The contribution 
records are public and we openly acknowledge our support. 
</P>
<P>
 And, our reason for supporting Quackenbush is no secret either. Insurers, like 
other business interests that make up California's economic fabric, want a 
strong, healthy marketplace in which to compete and conduct business. In 
pursuit of this goal, our members actively support candidates for legislative 
and statewide offices who embrace the kind of economic concepts that best serve 
our customers and investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush as well as many other candidates this year fit that criterion 
well.  
</P>
<P>
 Consumers are best served by a strong competitive market in which insurance is 
readily available.

TEENS AT RISK FOR STDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shari Roan's excellent Column One report (Oct. 26) on the alarming growth of 
sexually transmitted diseases among adolescents sadly mirrors the findings of 
Planned Parenthood in working with teens. Last year in our clinics, we saw 
nearly 15,000 teens, some of whom made the decision to have sex without condoms 
for such reasons as "I'm on the pill," or "He worked for (a local company), so 
he must be clean," or "You can't get AIDS from a woman." In the classroom, we 
urged more than 37,000 teens to act responsibly -- either postpone sexuality or 
heed the dangers of unprotected sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Should we be surprised that our educational efforts aren't more successful? 
Hardly, not when our message is competing with the media's far more exciting 
message that sex is OK. And not when so many adults, uncomfortable with their 
own sexuality, believe silence to be the best teacher. Open and honest 
discussion of sexuality in the home needs to be an essential part of family 
life, along with age-appropriate, reality-based comprehensive sexuality 
education curriculum in the schools. It is the responsibility of all of us -- 
parents, educators, clergy and health care professionals -- to provide young 
people with the facts and the nurturing they need to make wise decisions about 
their sexuality.

<P>
 * Thank you for your excellent piece on STDs among adolescents. At the Los 
Angeles Free Clinic Hollywood Center, where we see thousands of these young 
people every year, we know that the problem is serious. We also know that there 
are ways to treat adolescents and help them make more healthful and responsible 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 We provide free, non-judgmental care. It's hard to tell the staff from the 
clients, and young people feel safe discussing their problems with people who 
speak their language. We also know what questions to ask to determine whether a 
young person is at risk for STDs. Sadly, most internists and pediatricians 
don't ask the right questions, and young people are either too ashamed or too 
ignorant to volunteer that they are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 We also know that we cannot wait for a young person to come to us. The ones at 
highest risk simply don't come in for help until they are already infected -- 
and have infected others. We send outreach teams of youth educators to places 
where young people are most at risk: the streets of Hollywood, homeless 
shelters and continuation schools, to educate and counsel them about HIV, STDs, 
substance abuse, smoking and other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 We work very closely with a network of youth agencies to provide comprehensive 
care to adolescents. We know that substance abuse, domestic violence and 
homelessness all increase the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, 
and you cannot treat the symptoms without addressing the complicating lifestyle 
factors.

ATTORNEY GENERAL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The headline of your Oct. 26 article "Lungren 'Sleaze' Is Assailed" was highly 
misleading. In fact it is his opponent, Tom Umberg, who is running a campaign 
advertisement blaming the attorney general for the death of Polly Klaas.There 
is only one relevant fact in this story. Contrary to the claims of the ad, the 
name of the alleged murderer, Richard Allen Davis, was on the state database. 
If Sonoma County sheriff's deputies had checked the computer they would have 
verified the criminal history of Davis. This is a fact that no one involved 
with the case disputes.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Umberg ad is not concerned with facts. The exploitation of 
the tragic death of this little girl is perhaps a new low in California 
politics.

<P>
 U.S. Senate: DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D). Why take a chance with a relative unknown? 
Especially when the incumbent is terrifically effective? Feinstein is a 
powerful voice for California in the U.S. Senate and richly deserves 
reelection.

<P>
 47th -- CHRISTOPHER COX (R) State Offices 
</P>
<P>
 Governor: PETE WILSON (R). Kathleen Brown is fresh and determined but the 
experienced and capable Wilson, though wrong about Proposition 187, is right 
about a lot of other things and merits a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieutenant Governor: GRAY DAVIS (D). The longtime state controller offers 
experience and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State: TONY MILLER (D). Miller, the acting secretary of state, 
promises to curb voter fraud and clear the deadwood from voter registration 
rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Controller: KATHLEEN CONNELL (D). Formerly an investment banker, Connell would 
bring sharp, modern management ideas to government. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer: MATT FONG (R). Fong gets the nod over Phil Angelides, a quality 
player, because of his comprehensive proposals to increase efficiency and cut 
government costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney General: TOM UMBERG (D). The tough-on-crime Orange County assemblyman 
offers a nuanced approach to crime-fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner: ART TORRES (D). The Los Angeles state senator has a 
solid record as an advocate for consumers and has much experience dealing with 
insurance issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Equalization Office No. 4: BRAD SHERMAN (D). Sherman is a solid 
choice and deserves a second term in this important but often overlooked 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent of Public Instruction: DELAINE EASTIN. Maureen DiMarco is also 
a good candidate, but the edge for this nonpartisan office is held by Eastin, a 
Fremont assemblywoman who knows educational issues and has the political acumen 
for this key post. California Legislature

</P>
<P>
 70th -- MARILYN C. BREWER (R) Statewide Propositions 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 181 (Public Transportation Bonds): Authorizes $1 billion in 
general-obligation bonds to fund California's passenger rail transportation 
network. Unwise given the state's heavy debt load. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Proposition 183 (Recall Elections): Attacks wasteful back-to-back 
elections by allowing recall votes to be held as late as 180 days after 
certification. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 184 ("Three Strikes"): This ill-conceived and hugely 
expensive measure would imprison criminals convicted of a third felony (there 
are more than 500 such felonies under California law) for 25 years to life. 
It's dumb criminal justice policy. Worse still, it's unnecessary; legislation 
nearly identical to this initiative took effect last March. Passage would only 
make it harder for the Legislature and the governor to make necessary 
refinements in the existing law. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 185 (Gas Tax/Transportation): This measure, backed by 
Southern Pacific Railroad Co., imposes a 4% sales tax on gasoline. It would 
fund rail projects primarily; other transportation-related needs such as 
seismic retrofitting would be scanted. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 186 (Single-Payer Health Care): Establishes a state-run 
"single-payer" health care insurance plan and creates the post of state health 
commissioner. It sounds good in principle, but it's a big-government nightmare. 
This is one time California doesn't need to be the guinea pig for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 187 (Illegal Immigrants): This counterproductive measure 
would cut schooling, health and social services for the estimated 1.7 million 
illegal immigrants here -- and, even then, not come close to addressing the 
complex problem of immigration, which is rooted in economics. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 188 (Smoking and Tobacco Products): Masquerading as a tough 
anti-smoking measure, this mendacious offering -- paid for by tobacco companies 
-- would in fact emasculate all tough smoking regulations, both local and 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Proposition 189 (Expanding No-Bail Provisions): Amends the Constitution 
to permit courts to deny bail to individuals accused of "felony sexual assault 
offenses" who threaten another with physical harm. Good idea as long as it's 
not abused in implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Proposition 190 (Judicial Performance Commission): Reforms the state's 
Commission on Judicial Performance, which is responsible for disciplining 
errant or incompetent judges. The measure ensures that a majority of commission 
members will be from the public and grants the panel more authority to remove 
or discipline current and former judges. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Proposition 191 (Justice Courts): Eliminates justice courts and merges 
them with the municipal courts in jurisdictions of 40,000 or fewer people. Los 
Angeles County 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 2: TERRY B. FRIEDMAN. This veteran state assemblyman 
and former poverty lawyer has the patience, fairness and compassion to be an 
excellent judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 4: TERI SCHWARTZ. An outstanding prosecutor with the 
hard-core gang division of the L.A. County district attorney's office, Schwartz 
has the respect of her peers for her skill, intelligence and demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 93: MITCHELL BLOCK. In a close call over Susan 
Bryant-Deason, an accomplished prosecutor. Measures in L.A. County 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Los Angeles County, Charter Amendment A: Gives the County Board of 
Supervisors needed flexibility to increase or decrease the compensation for the 
posts of district attorney, assessor and sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- El Rancho Unified School District, Bond Measure C: Permits the El 
Rancho Unified School District in Pico Rivera to issue $13.3 million in 
general-obligation bonds in order to upgrade facilities including fire, 
earthquake, electrical and security systems; provide students with access to 
modern technology; renovate or replace obsolete facilities; construct permanent 
facilities, and make improvements to older buildings on district property. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- La Verne, Lancaster, San Dimas and Walnut, Measures E, F, G and L: An 
advisory vote to support the L.A. County Board of Supervisors' creation of a 
community facilities district (CFD). Property owners in cities that voluntarily 
join the CFD would be subject to a small assessment on their property taxes, 
when needed, to increase materials, hours and days of service at the besieged 
county public library branches in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Long Beach, Bond Measure D: Authorizes the issuance of up to $48 
million in general-obligation bonds to finance improvements to city facilities, 
bringing them into compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act.  
</P>
<P>
 YES -- San Marino, Special Tax I: Extends a special public safety tax for 
paramedic services, police protection and fire protection and prevention. The 
current levy expires in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Santa Monica, Charter Amendment J: Saves the city money by allowing it 
to publish condensed versions of city ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Santa Monica/Malibu Unified School District, Measure K: Permits the 
school district to continue a special tax that funds educational improvements. 
This measure extends the special parcel tax -- $58 a year -- for six years and 
increases it to $68 per parcel. The measure requires a two-thirds majority for 
passage. Orange County Offices

COLUMN LEFT / ROBERT SCHEER: DEATH PENALTY: A FASHIONABLE IDEA FOR THE '90S; 
HARD-LINERS ACT AS IF CRIME WOULD GO DOWN IF EVERYONE ON DEATH ROW DIED 
TOMORROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Robert Scheer is a former Times national correspondent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She was a perfect Exhibit A for the law-and-order hard-liners -- young, white, 
vulnerable, appealing and constantly invoking the name of the Lord. Perfect, 
except that she now sits in a South Carolina jail accused of having killed her 
own tiny children. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect also was the man she accused, an unidentified black male carjacker 
between 20 and 30 years old. Catch him and kill him is the slogan of the 
moment, and the nation would have rested easier if a suspect, any black 
suspect, had met that fate. No matter the truth, a composite of this 
nonexistent suspect has already been burned into our consciousness by the mass 
media; tried and convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the case in Boston five years ago when a white man all but convinced 
police that his pregnant wife had been killed by a black male. In the end, the 
white fellow leaped to his death from a bridge as the police were about to 
arrest him for the murder. But the damage had already been done and the 
stereotype of black and white, good and evil perpetuated. 
</P>
<P>
 How many black males, or others, now sit on Death Row falsely accused of 
murder because, in their cases, the truth didn't come out? We have fresh 
evidence that there may be quite a few. Thanks to DNA testing, scores of people 
serving time for heinous crimes have had their convictions overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 Once carried out, the death sentence makes a reversal of such error 
irrelevant. That is one reason why Amnesty International and virtually every 
human-rights group in the world oppose capital punishment. They are not being 
softhearted or indifferent to victims' rights, but rather recognize the cold 
reality that the victim is sometimes the accused. 
</P>
<P>
 Speak of forlorn causes. I don't even know why I bother to bring this up now 
except that Kathleen Brown's opposition to the death penalty has been an issue 
in this campaign and she has failed miserably to justify it. Instead, she has 
insisted that hers is a personal position and that as governor she would 
execute with the best of them.  
</P>
<P>
 She points out, accurately enough, that her father as governor killed 36 
people on Death Row while Republican governors in this state have only managed 
to do in two prisoners in the past 12 years. Evidently being in principle 
against the death penalty, as Pat Brown was, makes it that much more likely 
that you will order the cyanide to be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson defends his inactivity as an executioner by reference to 
drawn-out court appeals and insists he has the will to kill if only he could 
gain the legal authority. I don't doubt that. 
</P>
<P>
 What I do doubt is his motive in using the death penalty as a litmus test for 
being serious about fighting crime. Like his immigrant- and welfare-bashing, it 
is further evidence that he is quite willing to pollute the climate of our 
social discourse in the interests of advancing his own political fortunes.  
</P>
<P>
 This is just flag-waving to arouse the mob. He now concedes that his 
Proposition 187 is unenforceable and will do nothing to stop illegal 
immigration, just as he previously had to admit that his welfare-reform schemes 
cost more than they save. And he is certainly too intelligent to believe that 
the difference between a death penalty and a mandatory life sentence goes to 
the root causes of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 What these litmus-test issues do is distract us from the serious tasks at 
hand. They are a sideshow. Kill everyone on Death Row tomorrow and crime will 
still not go down. Pass Proposition 187 and next week Wilson's friends in 
agribusiness will hire just as many illegals to harvest the crop. Wipe out 
welfare and a new army of homeless families will choke the main arteries of our 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scare tactics and quick-fix solutions evidently have great electoral 
appeal. The danger is that other politicians will now rush to play these same 
cards. Remember candidate Bill Clinton dashing back to Little Rock to 
personally preside over the execution of a prisoner possessed of such limited 
mental capacity that he thought something pleasant was up? And our own Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, whom only Michael Huffington could make appear principled, 
never misses an opportunity to talk up her ardent support for the death penalty 
and barbed wire on the border. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new Congress, there will be no shortage of Democrats pushing all of the 
irrational but tough-sounding proposals that their opponents now use to torment 
them. Few leaders in either party will have the courage to seriously work the 
problems, lest they be called softhearted liberals or, even more dastardly, 
moderate Republicans. In the short run, the hard-liners will win; but in the 
long run we, the public, will suffer.

PERSPECTIVE ON WOMEN AND BANKING; THE LAST BASTION OF PATRIARCHY; 
ENTREPRENEURIAL WOMEN ARE BATTLING AGE-OLD OBSTACLES TO OBTAINING FUNDS FOR 
MAJOR VENTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY CARD and ADAM MILLER, Emily Card, a lawyer in Santa Monica and 
nationally published writer on finance, participated in the drafting of the 
Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Adam Miller is a UCLA graduate student. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's young women can hardly believe the horror stories about women's 
financial disfranchisement before the passage of the Equal Credit Opportunity 
Act in October, 1974. Back then, women had to be past child-bearing age to 
obtain credit on their own, without a male co-signor. The presumption was that 
all women would marry, become pregnant and drop out of the work force. Even 
middle-aged single women required mortgage co-signatories; in one ironic 
instance, a father in a nursing home had to sign for his daughter, a business 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Today we cannot imagine a world in which women don't have Visas, MasterCard 
and American Express; yesterday's pariah has become today's marketing target -- 
at least for consumer credit. But women business owners need capital today as 
much as women consumers needed access to equal credit 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't women get business capital? The answers have more to do with 
sociology than economics. 
</P>
<P>
 The weight of tradition or habit: Popular myth misstates that "most of the 
money in the country is owned by women." Women do own a substantial amount of 
capital, at least in name. But the flow of funds is still largely controlled by 
men, whether as owners of capital or husbands of owners, venture capitalists, 
trust officers or financial advisers. This vesting of money in men stretches 
back to the dawn of agrarian society, the beginning of the accumulation of 
capital and the birth of patriarchy, in which property and lineage was traced 
through the male line. 
</P>
<P>
 While few legal barriers remain to women in the business arena, to become 
successful entrepreneurs in large-scale businesses, women must have access to 
capital. It's hard to imagine a woman active in the business arena today who 
could cobble together capital for a takeover along the lines of Ted Turner's 
attempt to acquire CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 If women are to succeed, they must move from boot-strapped businesses using 
bundled credit-card debt as capital to businesses that are adequately 
capitalized from the start.  
</P>
<P>
 Models of success (and failure): Where are our Ted Turners? Ironically, one of 
the nearest examples is his wife, Jane Fonda, who turned acting celebrity into 
a fitness empire. Few other entrepreneurial women have achieved famous-name 
status or, as a group, critical mass. Until they do, the limiting effects are 
clear. Young women don't see the possibilities of business success. Middle-aged 
women of accomplishment don't feel empowered to leap from the corporate ladder 
to venture-backed success. And, most important, men investing money don't think 
of women when they think entrepreneur.  
</P>
<P>
 Prejudice: Though it is subtle today, prejudice against women and minorities 
in business still runs high. A reference to "women-run business" is most often 
taken to mean small-scale retail or service, not a mainstream profit-maker. 
Which is not to belittle the home-grown business. The small success stories of 
millions of women have amounted to a flourishing economic sector so large that 
one study suggests that women-owned businesses now employ more people than the 
Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as in politics 20 years ago, when the usual route to power for women was 
as widows or daughters of successful men, today, a scanning of the 1994 Forbes 
400 of wealthy families illustrates the same pattern: The richest women in the 
country inherited their wealth or married it. While many men on the list 
self-made their fortunes, only one female entrepreneur made the list: Estee 
Lauder. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is forecast that 40% of businesses will be women-owned by the end of 
the decade, up from 4.6% in 1972. But there are limits to the speed with which 
boot-strapping, sweat equity and determination translate into large-scale 
accumulations of capital. Women entrepreneurs are demanding better, faster 
access to the capital fast track. 
</P>
<P>
 The dearth of lead investors: Investments in start-up and even mid-level or 
"mezzanine" financing don't happen by magic. Like most undertakings, the 
investment community of private, family, venture and even institutional 
investors follows industry leaders or "lead investors." 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent national conference of a group whose mission is to increase the 
flow of capital to women-led businesses, none of the participants could cite a 
single woman lead investor. The women who do have capital must get it flowing 
to other women. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done to translate these limited examples into a wider capital 
arena for women? In the private sector, a group of women investors and business 
leaders has inaugurated a national group, the Capital Circle, to promote the 
flow of capital to women. Two equity-venture funds also have been launched in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Creativity is the key. What's stopping successful corporations from spinning 
off women-led businesses, or launching subsidiaries with women executives? 
</P>
<P>
 Until capital is directed to women because of their business prowess and not 
in the name of charity, the last bastion of patriarchy will not die.

A FLIRTATION WITH THE GOP TURNS COLD; POLITICS: WILSON'S EMBRACE OF PROP. 187 
WILL HAVE REPERCUSSIONS AS NEW LATINO VOTERS ENTER THE ELECTORATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY P. PACHON, Harry P. Pachon is president of the Tomas Rivera Center, a 
national policy-research institute based in Claremont. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first statewide poll to focus specifically on California Latino voters 
bears some unpleasant surprises for Gov. Pete Wilson and other politicians who 
have jumped on the anti-immigrant bandwagon. Contrary to conventional wisdom 
and to views promulgated by such groups as the Federation of Americans for 
Immigration Reform (FAIR), Latino voters are not buying the arguments put forth 
on behalf of Proposition 187. The poll, commissioned by the Tomas Rivera 
Center, KVEA-TV (the Telemundo affiliate in Los Angeles) and La Opinion, the 
largest Spanish newspaper in the nation, shows that Latino voters are 
overwhelmingly rejecting Proposition 187. Moreover, rejection of Proposition 
187 is accompanied by a turning away from Wilson and GOP senatorial candidate 
Mike Huffington. Poll results indicate that Wilson will be lucky to get 25% of 
the Latino vote, which would be the smallest share that any statewide 
Republican candidate has won in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
 Will this make a difference in the outcome Tuesday? Not likely, unless it's a 
close race between Wilson and Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Although one out of every four Californians is Latino, only one out of 11 
voters is. Close to two-thirds of California Latinos are ineligible to vote 
because they are minors or non-citizens. Politically, this means that Latino 
voter influence manifests itself only when the contest is a dead heat. Since 5% 
of the Latino vote equals 1% of the total state vote, then Latinos could 
provide the winning edge in a race that closes neck-and-neck. 
</P>
<P>
 The gubernatorial contest is not likely to be that close. Yet a troublesome 
issue remains. This election apparently will polarize Latino voters and 
non-Latinos. If the election goes as the polls predict, Pete Wilson will assume 
office with a no-confidence vote from the state's largest minority group. More 
than two-thirds of Latinos polled feel that Wilson is promoting anti-immigrant 
hatred with his support for Proposition 187, and that the immigration debate in 
California is fostering a climate that will result in discrimination and racism 
against Latinos. True or not, this is what Latino voters perceive, a depressing 
omen for Wilson's governorship should he win a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is the gap between Latino voters and the rest of the California electorate 
so large? The best explanation may be that the undocumented immigrant has 
become synonymous with the Latino immigrant. Yet political demographics give us 
another possible reason. It is a little-known fact that significant numbers of 
Latino voters in the state are foreign-born naturalized citizens. Quietly, and 
with little fanfare, close to 200,000 legal Mexican immigrants in the past 
decade have become American citizens -- most of them in California. 
Mexican-born naturalized U.S. citizens make up close to 10% of the Mexican 
American electorate. The percentages are probably higher for other Latin 
American-origin naturalized citizens.  
</P>
<P>
 The Latino electorate turned its attention to this election at the point when 
many politicos were engaging in shameless immigrant bashing and when images on 
television portrayed the illegal as being from "south of the border." The 
realization may have finally hit: The illegal alien them is really us.  
</P>
<P>
 The fallout of this polarization of the electorate won't be clear for some 
time. A common assumption among political analysts has been that the Republican 
Party is making slow but steady inroads into the California Latino vote. In 
American political history, however, there are defining events that influence 
ethnic communities' political allegiances. African Americans, for example, 
became much more loyal -- and important -- to the Democratic Party after 1964 
because of its civil-rights commitment. Conversely, Cuban Americans flocked to 
the Republican Party after their perceived betrayal by the Kennedy 
Administration. Will 1994 serve as a similar watershed election for 
California's Latino electorate? 
</P>
<P>
 If so, Republican candidates are going to have a rough time. Throughout the 
next decade, well over 1 million new Latino voters will enter the California 
electorate from two streams. Latino voters who will come of age (remember, more 
than one-third of Latinos in California today are under 18) and Latino 
immigrants who will become naturalized citizens (and who register to vote at 
rates higher than native-born Americans). 
</P>
<P>
 Political memories are long-lasting in ethnic communities. For the GOP, the 
hope is that Latinos don't follow the old Irish American saying: "Don't get 
mad, get even."

COLUMN RIGHT / JOEL D. ROBERTS: WHY IS THE NIGHT STALKER STILL ALIVE?; IT'S 
LUNACY TO KEEP A MAN ALIVE SO YOU CAN GIVE HIM THE DEATH PENALTY FOR THE 20TH 
TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL D. ROBERTS, Joel D. Roberts is a broadcaster on KABC radio in Los 
Angeles and is the 1994 recipient of the Anti-Defamation League's First 
Amendment award. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one who lived through it will ever forget the summer of 1985. Humid days, 
muggy nights and the air fetid more with terror than smog. This was the season 
of the Night Stalker and where Richard Ramirez roamed, he reigned. Now, nine 
years and 19 death sentences later, the Stalker is still likely more than a 
decade from death. We, the people of California, keep him alive. We house and 
feed him, clothe and entertain him, minister to his medical needs and 
facilitate his contact with fans. The fact that he has fans is appalling beyond 
comment, yet, as we all know, demons fascinate, and for some that fascination 
leads to love. 
</P>
<P>
 But those are the perversities of the fringe; what concerns me here is the 
perversity of the system. In fact, perverse may be too weak a word for it. 
Because whether Ramirez is insane -- which has long been debated -- the 
travesty that's about to occur surely is. 
</P>
<P>
 Already on San Quentin's Death Row, the Night Stalker now awaits trial in San 
Francisco on one final count of murder. The best possible outcome, from the 
state's point of view, would be a first-degree conviction with "special 
circumstances," resulting in yet a 20th death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 This lunatic redundancy will not come cheaply. The Los Angeles trial cost 
nearly $2 million (which was after the millions spent on the manhunt) and 
there's no reason to assume the new trial will cost less. 
</P>
<P>
 Acutely aware of this utter folly, the presiding judge has registered her 
disgust. Moreover, the victim's family, whose need for closure might justify 
the trial, has publicly stated they want no part of it. But the San Francisco 
district attorney needs to look tough on crime, so here we go with another 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, extravagant as this charade may be, the expense is the least of the 
problem. The new trial is not only pointless, it's dangerous. By alleging 
special circumstances, prosecutors have to show multiple murders, which means 
the Southern California survivors will again have to testify. They'll be forced 
to resurrect old terrors and, as they struggle with dimming memories the likely 
discrepancies between current and prior testimony will be fuel on the eager 
fire of the Los Angeles appeal. In short, what looms here is no mere 
redundancy, but the very real risk of a reversal. And remember, even if a death 
sentence is pronounced in San Francisco, another automatic appeal will begin, 
with its inevitable cycle of further delays. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as, if not more than, any monster before him, the Night Stalker draws 
out in stark relief the fallacies of the anti-death penalty polemic. Typically, 
abolitionists assert three major points: that capital punishment is legalized 
murder; that death sentences are disproportionately meted out to minorities, 
and that an innocent person could be executed in error. In the case of Ramirez, 
not a single one of these arguments persuades. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, executing murderers is no more the equivalent of murder than 
incarcerating kidnapers is the equivalent of kidnap. Yes, in the first case, 
both people die, just as, in the second case, both lose their freedom. Yet can 
anyone really fail to see the distinctions? Second, when it comes to mass 
murderers (most of whom are white) no one has claimed that race is a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, as an admitted serial killer, whether Ramirez murdered is not in 
dispute. The only real question remains "how many?" 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of questions, I have a few of my own, which I direct in particular to 
liberal judges and those criminal lawyers who seem to delight in perverse 
pyrotechnics: How many lives does a man have to take before we deem him 
undeserving of life? How much of our money does he have to consume before we 
resolve he'll consume no more? How God-awful does a human being have to be 
before the American Civil Liberties Union will pronounce him beyond the pale? 
How many death sentences must a murderer receive before the first is carried 
out? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers to these questions are far from imminent. They, like the Night 
Stalker, will linger at length. Meanwhile, the Satanist who gouged out the eyes 
of one of his victims -- was she alive or dead at the time? -- watches TV, 
piles up pentagrams and attends to his correspondence with fans. He's 
apparently happy, his health is robust, and we're told he needs no medication 
to sleep.

VOICES: PROP. 187: A CHORUS OF VIEWS

</P>
<P>
 It's a distraction from much bigger issues. Migration is a natural human 
process. People have been going back and forth since time began. We, as a 
civilized society, haven't been able to grab hold of that. The powers that be, 
the wealthy, are the ones who take advantage of immigrants. People go where 
there are jobs. We are providers. There is something that they need here. We're 
not looking at sanctions on employers. Workers are being exploited and we're 
not looking at that. We have to look at immigration as responsible human 
beings. If people don't get a proper education or proper health care, we're 
going to have an all-out epidemic.  
</P>
<P>
 It's in our own self-interest to provide services. The way to address 
immigration is by dialogue. The same with education. Who's going to benefit 
from this? How does society as a whole benefit? How can we share resources so 
that we can all benefit? 
</P>
<P>
 * Bill Baum 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman; resident of South Gate for 53 years  
</P>
<P>
 I feel strongly about the fact that these people are here getting services. I 
don't feel it's fair to people who come here legally or were born here, like 
myself. I grew up in Corona, which used to be a small town that was largely 
Latino, and I have no racially motivated ill will against illegal immigrants. 
But I do feel they are a drain on our tax base, and I feel something should 
definitely be done. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joe Hicks 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Christian Leadership Conference  
</P>
<P>
 Our board took a very strong stand against Proposition 187. We don't think it 
will work politically because it does not, in fact, aim its strength at illegal 
immigration at all. We do not think it will work fiscally -- in fact, it will 
cost us money. Lots of money will come out of even the local school district. 
And, of course, health care money will also be lost from money the federal 
government sends into the state. Then morally, I think the decision was made to 
oppose Proposition 187 because it targets, we think, some of the most 
vulnerable people in our society -- children, particularly -- in terms of 
disallowing education and disallowing immunizations and health-care treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mark Matsumura 
</P>
<P>
 Clergyman  
</P>
<P>
 I'm really sold on this bill. We have three major problems in California. One 
is education. Another is safety issues and another is business revitalization. 
I believe California collects enough taxes, but billions are funneled away to 
pay for illegal immigrants. This proposition will improve our education system, 
and I also believe this will bring more jobs to our state.  
</P>
<P>
 This is a responsible bill, a reasonable bill that will cut government waste 
-- basically going to illegal aliens -- and I think this will save taxpayers' 
dollars to be used for the taxpayers and not non-taxpayers.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm third-generation Japanese and my mother is Korean. My parents were subject 
to concentration camps during World War II. I don't think American history is 
going to revert back to such racist times. However, I think that's the fear 
tactic that the proposition's opponents are putting on. This has nothing to do 
with legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jesus Escandon

</P>
<P>
 I feel bad because as an educator, you want to shed knowledge and wisdom on 
all children regardless of legal status. There are no frontiers or boundaries 
to knowledge. I feel bad that because of legal status, you won't be able to 
reach a particular individual. Had this proposition been proposed 15 years ago, 
I would have never made it to UCLA or become a teacher. (Escandon came to the 
United States as an undocumented immigrant and graduated from UCLA in 1992.) If 
this was around 15 years ago, I would have never made it out of the barrio here 
in East L.A. Personally, I would have to report myself before I reported a 
child to the INS, because it is like turning my back on myself and my 
community.

<P>
 Proposition 187 doesn't really get at the issue. People come here for work. 
They leave their homelands not because they dislike their homelands but because 
they have no alternative. Proposition 187 is just really a cruel, coldhearted 
way to punish people who are already here and working very hard to survive and 
to make their contribution to society. Dealing with issues in 30-second sound 
bites relies on visceral, emotional arguments that don't really get at the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 This proposition creates a climate of fear and suspicion. A lot of our work 
has to do with the rights of immigrants and a primary right is the right to 
work and to live without fear of harassment.  
</P>
<P>
 The economy has eroded, there's no plan for conversion, jobs have left the 
state. All these fears about the economy and what's going on focuses on a group 
of people who had nothing to do with it. They're not responsible for the 
military-industrial complex closing down. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ezola Foster 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher, Bell High; member of Americans for Family Values  
</P>
<P>
 The reason I support Proposition 187 is that the federal government has 
refused to enforce its own laws in regard to immigration. So the people have 
come together to force changes. We have the most lenient immigration laws in 
the world. There are long lines of people waiting to come in legally. We can't 
afford to pay for people who come here illegally. The most controversial 
component of 187 is the denial of benefits. And it's understandable that that 
would be the most controversial because we are a compassionate and loving 
people. But we can't afford to pay for people who have broken our laws. The 
opponents say that this is a racist law, but it's not racist at all. It affects 
people of all colors who have come to this country illegally.  
</P>
<P>
 There are three main reasons why I'm in support of Proposition 187. One, 
illegal immigration violates the law that protects the sovereignty of our 
country. Two, the sole reason the Los Angeles Unified School District is 
overcrowded is due to illegal immigrants. And three, illegal immigration 
severely impacts our economy and increases the friction between citizens and 
non-citizens. One way it does that is by forcing citizens to compete with 
non-citizens for benefits.  
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and health professionals are not being asked to serve as police 
officers under the proposition. The normal admission policies would not change 
at all. We would just be allowed to ask one more question. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Almanzan 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It's a bad law, clean and simple. It's a badly written law that is going to 
bring a slew of problems to California. Economically, health-wise, law 
enforcement-wise. Proposition 187 is trying to attack immigrant communities for 
all the problems of California. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is not an immigration proposition. It does nothing about immigration. 
It does nothing for border enforcement. If you're frustrated about immigration, 
then look for a solution that does something about immigration. Proposition 187 
will not deter one single individual from coming into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Each segment of the proposition on its own is deadly. Going from the "suspect" 
clause that allows law enforcement to detain those that they "suspect" of being 
undocumented without any definition of what suspect means. Is it your skin? Is 
it your language? What defines suspect? 
</P>
<P>
 * Shawn Steele 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney, Koreatown  
</P>
<P>
 My wife is a Korean immigrant, as is most of her immediate family. I am 
pro-immigration, and was ambivalent about Proposition 187 until I read it. What 
I see is a prudent measure that would take public benefits away from people who 
are here illegally, some of whom cannot and do not produce something beneficial 
to society. Immigrants who have waited for years and have overcome economic and 
political obstacles to come here are being punished. 
</P>
<P>
 If we do not choose to take any action, it will be a signal to other people 
throughout the world who are sick or poor that if you can only drop in here, 
you will get great medical and educational services without any prohibition. As 
long as we make it unbelievably inviting, we'll continue to get people coming 
in. It's one of many reforms we need. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enrique Arevalo 
</P>
<P>
 President-elect, Mexican-American Bar Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 We stand against Proposition 187 for the simple reason that it's 
unconstitutional on the basis of equal protection. It's a matter that's already 
been dealt with by the court. And we don't believe the court will approve it. 
But we don't want things to get that far. It will be a long and expensive legal 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not in favor of illegal immigration. We definitely feel we have a right 
to control our borders. But this will not control illegal immigration. It's a 
national problem. It's an international problem. When we have parity in wages 
between the United States and Mexico, there won't be any reason for people to 
come here. Mexico basically uses the United States as a safety valve for its 
unemployed. When the United States can hold Mexico accountable for its 
practices, then we will have a chance at controlling immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think people will go back to their homelands because their kids can't 
get into school. The practical reality is that it's going to create an 
underclass of Latino children who are not going to go to school, who are going 
to stay home and watch TV. And that's not good for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alan White 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher working in South-Central  
</P>
<P>
 I don't think that our borders, our welfare system or our school system should 
be there for the taking. This would maybe deter people from coming in over the 
border. They would realize that they would be under closer scrutiny. They would 
have second thoughts about so willingly coming into the country and getting 
jobs and false documents. Right now, they can just come in, get false 
identification, and no one asks them anything. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be fewer people competing for services. We have more than enough 
people in need. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tim Everett 
</P>
<P>
 El Rescate  
</P>
<P>
 Basically, we think it's not only an unjust and mean proposition, it's also 
not a very logical proposition as far as doing what it says it wants to do. 
But, of course, we wouldn't be for it even if it did. We believe immigration is 
good for the economy, we think it's a traditional part of California. It's 
always been part of the culture and the economics. We think Proposition 187 is 
a political ploy that feeds upon fear and scapegoating of immigrants. My 
experience is that most people come here to work -- 99%. The ones that I talk 
to are quite proud that they are not on any kind of public assistance. That's 
seen as a bad thing, so very few people take public assistance even if they do 
qualify. And most of them don't qualify.  
</P>
<P>
 I think most of Proposition 187's support is from people who are frightened of 
a change in their lifestyle or frightened of maybe losing their political 
power. Are people who are supporting 187 so ignorant, so naive that they don't 
realize who cooks their food, who washes their clothes, who mows their lawn, 
who picks the crops up in the Central Valley, who works in the garment 
district, et cetera? 
</P>
<P>
 * Chandler Im 
</P>
<P>
 Social service worker, Koreatown  
</P>
<P>
 It's just passing the buck. I feel this was just designed to scapegoat 
immigrants for the problems of this country, especially the problems of 
California. Too many politicians are using this as a steppingstone to higher 
office or just to maintain their position. I was born in Korea and I feel we 
have to do something about immigration. But not this way. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother doesn't speak perfect English and because of her looks, because of 
the way she talks, if she was to need medical attention she would probably be 
"suspect." She has a green card, she is a legal resident. But if she were to 
seek medical care, she would be subject to all kinds of questions. That 
violates her right to live here. Why does she have to go through that? 
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
 It's not the jurisdiction of the schools to be policing the students as to 
their resident status. I'm a teacher trainer, and I don't train my students to 
do these things. What am I going to tell my student teachers, "Now we have to 
take a class on how to identify illegal aliens"? It's morally and ethically 
bankrupt for us to teach our future teachers to do this.

SOTO GIVES GARFIELD A SORE LEG UP OVER ROOSEVELT

 Garfield High football Coach John Aguirre calls Edgar Soto the best-kept 
secret in the City Section, but the running back was far from incognito in the 
Bulldogs' 20-6 victory over Roosevelt Friday night in the East L.A. Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-8, 160-pound senior rushed for 158 yards in 25 carries despite a 
sore thigh in the Southeastern Conference game before 22,000 at East L.A. 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt closed to 13-6 on Jesus Perez's second field goal, a 40-yard kick 
with 10 minutes to play, but Soto and the Garfield ground game prevented the 
Roughriders from getting any closer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs marched 83 yards with Soto scrambling for a nine-yard touchdown 
with 2:57 left to put Garfield ahead, 20-6. Soto carried nine times for 40 
yards during the 15-play drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Roosevelt) kept on trying to give me shots in the leg trying to hurt me," 
said Soto, who has rushed for 1,084 yards and 13 touchdowns this season. "It 
didn't work, though. The shots kind of numbed it. I felt better as the game 
wore on." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the fourth in a row for Garfield in the 60-year series between 
the rival East L.A. schools. Roosevelt leads the series, 29-25-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield, aided by interceptions by Tony Zamarano and Jesse Villalobos, jumped 
to a 13-0 second-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamarano's 12-yard interception return to the Roosevelt 31-yard line set up 
the Bulldogs' first touchdown, a nine-yard run by Alex Pintado early in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs increased their lead to 13-0 on a two-yard run by Soto midway 
through the second quarter.

CRENSHAW EDGES BANNING, 14-7; FOOTBALL: THE VICTORY GUARANTEES COUGARS (8-1 
OVERALL) THE BEST RECORD IN THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC CONFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Crenshaw Coach Robert Garrett shouted at the referees. He also yelled at his 
players. But Garrett made his biggest impact when he whispered to his 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to run another play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the fourth quarter, Garrett told Crenshaw quarterback Ricky Lumford to 
run a dive play instead of a sweep, and it changed the direction of the game 
Friday as the Cougars pulled off a 14-7 win over Banning at Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The win guaranteed Crenshaw (8-1 overall) the best record in the Southern 
Pacific Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Noticing one of Banning's top defenders had hobbled off the field, Garrett 
used a brief timeout to call his quarterback over to the sidelines and whisper 
a new play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We changed from a sweep left to a fullback dive," Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing third down and four from the Banning 38-yard line, Lumford handed off 
to Brandon Seals, who ran eight yards up the middle. Five plays later, Seals 
scored from the three with 4:08 remaining. The touchdown completed a 12-play, 
72-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 On their previous possession, Crenshaw faked a punt on fourth down and Lumford 
ran six yards to the Crenshaw 14--but that was 21 yards short of a first down 
and the Cougars lost possession.  
</P>
<P>
 Garrett, however, thought he had a free play to run after the botched fake 
because the Pilots had 12 men on the field--an infraction calling for a 15-yard 
penalty and repeat of the down. But the referees declined to call a penalty, 
ruling that one of the Banning players was running off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 That brought an explosive response from Garrett, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Four plays later, Banning tied the score, 7-7, on Dupree Tave's four-yard run 
with 8:40 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The running of Seals and backfield mate Farrel Payton, however, had Garrett 
looking like a coaching genius. The seniors combined for 207 yards and two 
touchdowns. Payton scored the Cougars' first touchdown on a 20-yard run early 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banning was determined to run on us," Garrett said. "You can't come over to

 Cross-country met country music head on, and the music won. 
</P>
<P>
 Greek Theatre officials cut short a cross-country meet at Griffith Park 
involving Southeastern and Northern Conference schools Oct. 21 because of a 
Brooks & Dunn concert later that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross-country races start and finish on a grassy field next to the Greek 
Theatre that is also used for parking for theater events. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the races had been run when officials halted the meet at 4 p.m. for 
the 7:30 p.m. concert despite protests from coaches to allow the remaining four 
races to be combined into one race. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was discovered the City Section had no permit to use the field, Greek 
Theatre officials called in park rangers to escort the teams back to their 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of arguing forever, they could have run the race and everybody could 
have been out of there in 15 minutes," Belmont Coach Alex Carmona said. "It's 
not like we were in the way. People weren't even going to start coming in for 
at least another hour." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident marked the first time in 13 years a conflict had arisen involving 
use of the field. City Section commissioner Barbara Fiege said park permits 
were not required until three years ago, but the section wasn't aware of the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said a permit has since been obtained from the Parks and Recreation 
Dept. but said there are no other conflicts between cross-country races and the 
Greek Theatre events this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had never been asked for a permit before," Fiege said. "There was some 
heated discussion, but without a permit we had no leg to stand on. We had no 
choice but to stop the meet." 
</P>

 Five of a kind -- The Cal State Los Angeles women's cross-country team swept 
the first five places in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships 
in San Diego on Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference title was the first in school history for Cal State L.A., which 
became the only school besides Cal Poly San Luis Obispo to win the women's CCAA 
title. Cal Poly SLO had won all 13 conference titles before moving to NCAA 
Division I this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Marisa Avendano of Cal State L.A. was the individual winner, touring the 
5,000-meter Balboa Park course in 17 minutes 33 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Marisol Cossio (17:57), Martha Pinto (18:10), Mary Ann Martinez (19:03) and 
Marisol Pedraza (19:05) rounded out the scoring in second through fifth for the 
Golden Eagles, who totaled a perfect 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State L.A.'s combined team time of 1:31:56 was more than eight minutes 
faster than runner-up Grand Canyon (1:40:02), which finished second with 73 
points. UC San Diego and Cal Poly Pomona were third and fourth with 84 and 86 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Perea, the 1992 City champion from Huntington Park, was 10th in the 
men's 8,000-meter race in 26:26 for Cal State L.A., which finished fifth in the 
team's competition.

 Names in the news -- Ronnie Arch of Crenshaw and Johnnie Sanders of Franklin 
were among the preseason top 50 basketball players on the West Coast chosen by 
Student Sports magazine. Arch, a 6-foot-5 guard, helped Crenshaw to its second 
consecutive State Division I title last season. Sanders, a two-time All-City 
3-A selection, averaged 26 points as a junior.

 Grass roots -- If the grass at East Los Angeles College looked unseasonably 
green for Friday night's football game between Garfield and Roosevelt, it was 
no illusion. The field was painted earlier in the week.

THEATER NOTES; TAPER OFFERS PEEK INTO THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Don Shirley, Don Shirley is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each year the Mark Taper Fo rum offers sneak previews of possible coming 
attractions in its New Work Festival. The public attends free rehearsals of 
projects in development at either the workshop level or simply as readings. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Taper main stage productions that first went through the New Work 
Festival are "The Waiting Room," "Bandido!" "Angels in America," "The Kentucky 
Cycle," "Jelly's Last Jam" and "Stand-Up Tragedy." Last year "The Woman 
Warrior" was at the festival; next year it'll play the Taper's sister theater, 
the Doolittle. 
</P>
<P>
 Other theaters also schedule plays that went through the festival. Taper 
literary associate Oliver Mayer's "Blade to the Heat," which opened last week 
at the New York Shakespeare Festival, went through the Taper festival under the 
title "Ragged Time" in 1993. Taper staff member Peter Brosius will stage Milcha 
Sanchez-Scott's "The Old Matador" -- which was read in the festival last 
February -- at the Arizona Theatre Company in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's associate producer, Mara Isaacs, predicts this year's festival, 
which opened last week and continues into February, will also turn up its share 
of future productions. Three of the productions scheduled for workshops "are 
real contenders for next season" on the main stage, she said. She demurred 
about which three, though -- too much pressure on the writers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaacs has been promoted to a new title with new duties this year, running the 
nuts and bolts of the festival under the supervision of Robert Egan. Egan's own 
1993 promotion to the title of Taper producing director expanded his 
responsibilities on the main stage, allowing him less time for the day-to-day 
details of the festival, which operates -- this year -- at two 99-seat spaces: 
the Taper, Too in the Cahuenga Pass and Actors' Gang in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Actors' Gang space was added this year primarily to accommodate two 
performance art evenings, especially one featuring a performer in a wheelchair, 
Cheryl Marie Wade. The county-owned Taper, Too is still not wheelchair 
accessible, although the county is working on it, Isaacs said, so it was 
necessary to move Wade's performance elsewhere. The Taper and the Actors' Gang 
have cooperated on several previous projects, so the Gang space was drafted for 
the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaacs arrived at the Taper in 1990 shortly after graduating from UC Berkeley, 
where she majored in medical anthropology. It may sound like an unorthodox 
major for a budding producer, but Isaacs said the theater and anthropology have 
a lot in common. In both fields, "you move into a society and you're both 
participant and observer. You analyze and react accordingly. Theater is a 
fascinating culture." 
</P>
<P>
 SPIEGEL SUSPENDED: The Actors' Equity 99-Seat Theater committee has suspended 
Ivan Spiegel's producing privileges under Equity agreements for one year and 
plans to conduct regular safety and sanitation inspections at the theater 
Spiegel runs, the two-stage Burbage complex in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee confirmed a revocation of Spiegel's producing rights made by an 
Equity administrator two weeks ago. The action was prompted by complaints about 
an agreement Spiegel required actors to sign and by reports of unsanitary 
conditions at the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel said he would appeal the decision to higher Equity authorities or, if 
necessary, go to court. In the meantime, productions using Equity actors may 
continue to use the Burbage as long as Spiegel is not the producer.*

PRIVATE LIVES; FAMILY; NO MINIMUM (AGE) AT THIS JAZZ CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Veteran percussionist Adam Rudolph has an international following, performing 
with such artists as Yusef Lateef, Herbie Hancock and Don Cherry. Guitarist 
Kevin Eubanks is a featured performer with Branford Marsalis' "Tonight Show" 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 And, every week, these artists and others spend their Sunday afternoons 
playing improvisational music for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Sunday matinee concerts at the Jazz Bakery in the historic Helms 
Bakery Building near Culver City are adult stuff deliberately made 
child-friendly: Children get in free, no one panics if toddlers stroll down the 
aisle, and goodies are served in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our culture there's always this categorization, such as what's children's 
music, as opposed to adult music? We're just playing what we play and giving 
children an opportunity to hear it," Rudolph said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young ones especially don't think about what's hip or in style; they 
don't have labels. They just hear the sound and they feel what's being said 
musically. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we like about playing at the Jazz Bakery is that it's a respectful 
environment. When the children are present . . . they're part of the loop of 
the expression." 
</P>
<P>
 How young is too young for the concerts? "We don't mind any age," said Ruth 
Price, Jazz Bakery's president and artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever parents think their children can absorb. It's all improv, something 
kids seem to enjoy. The lighting is very theatrical, and sometimes the 
daughters of the performers will get up and recite."* 
</P>
<P>
 * The Jazz Bakery, Helms Bakery Building, 3233 Helms Ave. Sundays at 3 p.m. 
through December. Adults, $7; students, $5; under age 12, free. (310) 271-9039.

GM PICKUPS: MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Government Takes Aim at GM Pickups" (Oct. 18) is a further demonstration of 
the Clinton Administration's endless ability to waste energy (taxpayers' 
dollars) on minuscule problems.In Transportation Secretary Federico Pena's 
current attack on side-mounted gas tanks on GMC pickups, his stated numbers are 
15 years and 150 deaths. That averages out to perhaps 10 deaths per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 50,000 people die in traffic accidents every year, Secretary Pena, how 
about taking a somewhat larger bite of the apple?

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL JOURNAL: A SUMMARY OF SELECTED CITY HALL ACTIONS THIS 
WEEK AFFECTING CENTRAL LOS ANGELES.

<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * NUISANCE LIQUOR STORE: Agreed with the Board of Zoning Appeals that Irene's 
Liquor Store at 8825 S. Figueroa St. constitutes a public nuisance and ordered 
the owner to comply with several corrective measures. Among the conditions 
imposed are the hiring of a state-licensed unarmed security guard, the 
placement of a "no loitering" sign on the premises and the installation of a 
gate at the parking lot that will be locked when the store is closed. Residents 
of the neighborhood had complained about drug sales, littering, public 
drunkenness and panhandling on and around the store's property. The owner had 
contended that he already had a security guard on the premises, but residents 
contended that the guard had been harassing them and was attracting people who 
contribute to the nuisance activity. 
</P>
<P>
 * NUISANCE ALLEY: Approved a motion closing to the public the use of an alley 
north of Exposition Boulevard, south of 36th Street, west of 4th Avenue and 
east of 5th Avenue in response to complaints from nearby residents about 
illegal dumping, abandoned vehicles and loitering by transients. A set of gates 
will be installed to deter such activities. 
</P>
<P>
 * MARIACHI FESTIVAL: Approved these street closures on Nov. 20 from 6 a.m. to 
8 p.m. for the 4th annual Festival de los Mariachis de Los Angeles: Boyle 
Avenue between 1st and Enchandia streets; Pennsylvania Avenue between Boyle and 
Enchandia; Enchandia between Pennsylvania and Pleasant Avenue; Pleasant between 
1st and Enchandia. The festival will feature mariachi music, dancing, 
children's activities and food booths. 
</P>
<P>
 * FIELD IMPROVEMENTS: Accepted a $65,000 donation from Coca-Cola Inc. to be 
used to refurbish the baseball field at Harvard Recreation Center at 1535 W. 
62nd St. The money, provided through Coca-Cola's Homers Across America program, 
will pay for a new scoreboard, bleachers, fencing and backstop. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * HIRING FREEZE LIFTED: Approved an exemption to the city's hiring freeze that 
will allow the Department of Parks and Recreation to fill 105 gardening 
positions. The jobs -- 72 gardener caretakers and 33 senior gardeners -- will 
involve work at city parks. Those who opposed the motion did so because they 
favored a more ambitious plan that would have allowed the parks and recreation 
department an exemption to fill 1,166 positions as they become vacant. A vote 
on that latter plan was rescheduled for Nov. 15. Passed 9 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting yes: Jackie Goldberg, Nate Holden, Rudy Svorinich Jr. Voting no: 
Richard Alatorre, Mike Hernandez, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rita Walters. MICHAEL

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WESTLAKE; COMMUNITY TO HEAR REDEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of City Planning has invited local residents, 
property and business owners to an open house Wednesday on proposed changes to 
the Westlake community redevelopment plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Amendments to the plan, adopted by the city in 1974, are being considered 
because the area is now one of the city's most densely populated. 
</P>
<P>
 They involve down-zoning some of Westlake's residential areas to relieve 
population density, said Jim Tokunaga, a planning associate with the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Draft documents on the proposed changes will be available to the public, and 
presentations will be made by city staff at 5 and 7 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Staff will also be available to answer questions and listen to recommendations 
from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held from 4 to 8 p.m. in the multipurpose room of 
Esperanza Elementary School, 689 Little St.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will open a police drop-in center next week at Montara Avenue 
Elementary School that will serve as a convenient, comfortable place for 
residents to bring concerns and obtain information about law enforcement and 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "This unique center will mean that the police and the city will be that much 
closer to the pulse of the community and thus better able to serve the 
community," said Mayor Albert T. Robles. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will open Nov. 15 and will be staffed by civilian volunteers who 
live in the neighborhood surrounding the school at 11018 Montara Ave. Residents 
will be able to get information on home and traffic safety, gang and drug 
prevention, and city services Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2 to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider this a pilot program and look forward to having a similar program 
established in each of our schools throughout the city," Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is part of the city's community-based policing efforts, which aim 
to develop better relations between the community and police.

NFL REFEREES EARN STRIPES; PRO FOOTBALL: TO THE OFFICIALS, ANONYMITY IS BLISS. 
WHEN THE FANS DON'T KNOW THEY ARE ON THE FIELD, "THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK MELVIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To an NFL referee, anonymity is bliss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to come into a town and leave without ever being noticed," says 
Larry Nemmers, a 10-year veteran of NFL officiating. "When people don't know 
we're out there, that's the name of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case when Nemmers and his crew got together in Cleveland earlier 
this season for a typical weekend of wall-to-wall football. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday afternoon, they caught Ohio State-Purdue on TV. Then they scared 
up an unused conference room at the Airport Marriott so they could pore over 
three hours of specially edited NFL highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sunday, they had the best standing-room view you could imagine for the 
sold-out Bengals-Browns game. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, these guys take their football seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figure we work 1,500 to 1,700 hours a year," said Nemmers, 51, a retired 
high school principal. "We consider that pretty much a full-time job." 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL still likes to think of its officials as part-timers, for the obvious 
reason: Part-time work, part-time pay. 
</P>
<P>
 But the officials -- most of whom work other jobs during the week -- formed an 
association and won a new contract in September that nearly doubled their 
salaries. Pay now ranges from $1,325 per game for a first-year official to 
$4,009 per game for someone with 20 years' experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemmers, with 10 years' experience, gets $2,239 per game. Although as referee 
he's the lead official on the crew, he makes no more than any other official 
with the same amount of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL has 15 crews, each with seven officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We all watch the officiating in other games," Nemmers said. "I'm a 
cheerleader for the other officials. We all are. It doesn't make any difference 
what official makes a poor call; it reflects on all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, NFL officials are every bit as defensive about their work as you 
might imagine. Nothing bugs them more than TV announcers who don't know the 
rules as well as they should, or act as if they do. 
</P>
<P>
 An example: In a Monday night game between Kansas City and Denver a few weeks 
ago, John Elway threw an apparent touchdown pass that was nullified because the 
receiver came back for the ball after being pushed out of the end zone. 
Nemmers, watching on TV, heard one of the announcers complain that the 
defensive back should have been whistled for illegal contact; in fact, the push 
was legal because Elway had scrambled out of the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you know, those announcers never come back and correct themselves," 
Nemmers said. 
</P>
<P>
 A nasty comment by an announcer pales in comparison with getting "dinged" by 
the league office. That's ref-speak for a "downgrade," every official's 
nightmare. Too many can cost you your job; top guns at each position, by 
contrast, work the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week, Jerry Seeman, the NFL's director of officiating, and his staff go 
over tapes of every game, evaluating every flag that was thrown and every flag 
that should have been thrown. Each official gets a grade, and some of the best 
and worst calls of the week are compiled into an instructional tape that crew 
members watch together on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular week, members of another crew got dinged for failing to 
eject Atlanta's Andre Rison and San Francisco's Deion Sanders for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When players swing at each other like that, you gotta kick 'em out," Nemmers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Deion? 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just numbers to us," said Don Orr, the field judge on Nemmers' crew. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nemmers' weekend begins at 3:45 a.m. Saturday, when the alarm goes off at his 
home in Springfield, Mo., so he can catch a 5:30 a.m. flight to Cleveland via 
Dallas. All members of the crew are supposed to be at the game hotel by 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after noon, there's an informal meeting in Nemmers' hotel room, 
followed by three hours of film work, a trip to church, dinner, and a couple 
hours going over the weekly open-book test from the league office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, the crew members arrive at the stadium several hours before kickoff so 
they can check field conditions, meet with representatives of both teams, 
ensure players' equipment and uniforms meet regulations, and go over other 
last-minute details. 
</P>
<P>
 The work hardly ends at the final gun. There's paperwork -- all penalties and 
timeouts are logged as the game progresses -- and the referee later can request 
tapes of disputed or interesting plays from NFL Films for review. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In season, Nemmers tends to NFL business every day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Monday: After faxing his game report to the NFL office, he holds a 
preliminary discussion of the game with a supervisor. He also spends about 1 
1/2 hours daily working out on his stationary bike, Soloflex and run-in-place 
trampoline. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tuesday: Throughout the week, Nemmers sets aside 45-minute blocks for rules 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wednesday: A specially prepared videotape of the last game for review 
arrives via overnight mail. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thursday: The league tells Nemmers which game his crew will be working in 
four weeks (assignments are always made four weeks ahead), and one of the 
supervisors calls to critique last Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Friday: Nemmers checks the weather for this week's game site and packs 
accordingly. He also picks up a newspaper with the stats of the teams he'll be 
officiating Sunday so he'll know their tendencies. "A third-and-3 with Detroit 
isn't the same as a third-and-3 with Denver," Nemmers says. The crew tries to 
have the action flanked at all times by at least two officials, preferably 
more. Anticipation helps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's easier to handle the increasing NFL demands now that Nemmers has taken 
early retirement from his job as principal at Elgin High School in Illinois. He 
plans on teaching a few courses at Southwest Missouri State soon, however, and 
all the other members of his crew still hold other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never let the National Football League interfere with being a high school 
principal," said Nemmers, who retired from his regular job last June. "The 
students and teachers always wanted to know where you were going the next week. 
They were very supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time I had a Bears game in New Orleans, and I called Jim Harbaugh for 
intentional grounding. It was a fairly easy call. He threw it 20 yards out of 
bounds and there was no receiver in the area. The Bears had to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day I was walking into school, and I had one of the school's 
football players come up, put his arm around me and say, 'Mr. Nemmers, you cost 
me five bucks yesterday.' But it was always good-natured."

COMMENTARY; MAYBE THE BILLS REALLY BELONG IN THAT JANUARY GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jets aren't good enough to make a yard when they need it against the 
Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts handed them the ball on five turnovers last Sunday and the Jets 
still couldn't win. At the very end, with the game lost, people like Donald 
Evans and Ronnie Lott decided to get tough with the referees. 
</P>
<P>
 They should have tried that with the Colts. Marshall Faulk ran through Lott 
and the Jets for a big fourth-quarter touchdown as if the Jets were traffic 
cones. It was a predictable and embarrassing performance, against a team the 
Jets like to think is out of their weight class. You wonder what kind of chance 
they have today when once again asked to step up in class against the Buffalo 
Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is where we are: The Jets try to push officials around. The Bills push 
Joe Montana around. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets surprised the Bills in the first game of the season. The Jets and 
Bills entered last Sunday's games with the same 4-3 record. The Jets went 
against the Colts and came out losers. The Bills beat Montana, 44-10. Bruce 
Smith looked like the best player in the league. Jim Kelly threw the ball 
around for four touchdowns, so the Bills only needed 77 rushing yards and one 
touchdown from Thurman Thomas. The Bills ruined the Chiefs the same way they 
did in the AFC Championship Game last January. 
</P>
<P>
 On the last Sunday of October, whatever the records of all the other teams, 
the Bills looked like the class of the sport. I have been saying all year the 
Bills are finally ready to win the Super Bowl. If they do, they will make 
January of 1995 feel for their fans the way October of 1955 felt for the fans 
of the Brooklyn Dodgers. It will be one of the great sports stories of them 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been cursed the way the New York Rangers were cursed," Thurman Thomas 
was saying on Tuesday. "But we're going to throw off our curse the way the 
Rangers finally did." 
</P>
<P>
 I was one of the people who wanted the Bills to go away because they killed 
too many Super Bowls. That is over. Thomas finally turned me around on the 
character of a remarkable team. "Nobody has ever stayed in there like this," 
Thomas said one day last summer. "You can't keep rooting against that." And he 
was right. The glory of the Bills is that they are still here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing against the Jets, because they beat us once already and they always 
play us tough," Thomas said. "But if we play with the same intensity as we did 
against the Chiefs, we'll win. When this ballclub plays like that, nobody can 
beat us. We're still the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the locker room before (last Sunday's) game, every single player on this 
team -- even the ones not playing -- was fired up. I haven't seen the room like 
that in a long time. If it had been like that all season, we'd be 8-0." 
</P>
<P>
 I had lunch with Thomas before the Bills' first exhibition game in September, 
at a place called the Nickelodeon Cafe, not far from his home in Dupuy, N.Y. 
Thomas was full of big talk that day about going back to the Super Bowl. But he 
also spoke wearily of all the preseason games ahead, and then 16 regular-season 
games, then the playoffs after that. The last Sunday in January seemed like 
some distant point on the football map, especially for the Bills, who were 
supposed to be through after losing four Super Bowls in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now I feel like we've got the old feeling back," Thomas said. "After 
Sunday's game, I felt like I did the first year we went to the Super Bowl. And 
I wasn't the only one. I looked around and everybody was excited, everybody was 
having fun. We must have had 50 players at Jim Kelly's house Sunday night, 
watching the Sunday night game between the Cardinals and the Steelers, but 
mostly going over our game with the Chiefs, play by play. Kelly kept saying, 
'We're on a roll now, we're on a roll, we got to play like this every Sunday.' 
We all know that if we do, we're going back to the big game." 
</P>
<P>
 They have lost some players, the way everybody else in the league has. They 
are thinner, and older, and watching the clock. "I saw some graphic the other 
night where we're one of the oldest teams in the league," Thomas said. 
"Fourth-oldest, fifth-oldest, something like that. I know we're always saying 
that this might be our last chance. But maybe this is our last chance." There 
was the shocking loss to the Jets on the first Sunday, Thomas only gaining 5 
yards on seven carries. There was a loss to the Bears when Thomas was hurt. A 
couple of weeks ago, the Bills lost to the Colts at home and it was as if they 
didn't even show up. 
</P>
<P>
 So there was a chance, if the Bills had lost to the Chiefs, that the record 
would be 4-4 halfway through the season. If ever the Bills were going to 
declare themselves ready to make another run at the big game, this was the 
time. Bills vs. Chiefs ended up 44-10 and must have felt like 84-10 to the 
Chiefs. Bruce Smith made Montana look like an old man. Kelly did all he wanted 
against the pass defense of a Chiefs team that also fancies itself a Super Bowl 
contender. It was never a game after the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 This came on a Sunday when the Jets could not make a yard against the Colts 
and then whined about the spot of the ball afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Bills-Chiefs game, the Bills players said a team prayer and then 
Marv Levy made a short statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great game," Levy said to his players. "Now let's kick the -- -- out of the 
Jets next week," and walked out of the room. A little while later, Thomas was 
in the interview room and got tired of answering questions about where the 
Bills' offense had been before Sunday. So he started telling reporters to shut 
up before he stormed away from the podium. Clearly, the Bills are moving toward 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers still have a better record. The Dolphins have a better record. 
Maybe this will be one of the rare seasons when the AFC Championship Game is 
not played at Rich Stadium. And with all that, go tell Joe Montana the Bills 
are not the best team in the AFC, or anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong. We're not there yet," Thomas said. "I'm going to put us 
right where our record should put us, behind the Chargers and the Dolphins. 
What we need to do now is play four or five weeks in a row the way we played 
last week. If we do that, then you're looking at the best of the conference 
again." Thomas paused and then said something the Bills say a lot: "Deal with 
it, America." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody outside western New York State has been against them. I ran with 
that crowd for a while. The Bills never care and never quit. They come to 
Giants Stadium Sunday. The place finally sees a real team. The Jets and their 
fans should treat this like Super Sunday. A game against the Bills is as close 
to the Super Bowl as they ever get.

NBA TIP-OFF; HOW MUCH BRATWURST FOR NO. 1? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAL BOCK, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to the great good sense of David Stern and Charles Grantham and the 
army of attorneys around them, we have an NBA season. They chose to talk 
instead of walk -- a revolutionary concept in modern sports labor relations -- 
and for this they must be saluted. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are reasonable men, Stern and Grantham bought themselves a year 
or so to work out a new collective bargaining agreement. And don't be surprised 
if, when they complete the document, it includes some kind of rookie salary 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 If the NBA has any economic trouble -- a doubtful premise -- it has nothing to 
do with established stars who've demonstrated their value. Instead, the problem 
involves the hotshots arriving out of college and signing contracts that would 
take care of the national debt for some Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Top to bottom, no league is more generous with its rookies than the NBA. A 
first-round pick is guaranteed a $200,000 minimum salary and no one can 
remember the last time one of them got that little. 
</P>
<P>
 The penultimate first-rounder in June's draft was Charlie Ward, voted the best 
football -- not basketball -- player in the land. Chosen No. 27, he got a 
five-year $4.4 million deal, which translates to $800,000-plus annually from 
the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not bad but still considerably less than the payoff at the other end of 
the draft class, where lottery teams routinely treat their picks like lottery 
winners. Dallas paid No. 2 Jason Kidd $54 million for nine years. No. 3 Grant 
Hill got $45 million for eight years from Detroit. Donyell Marshall, picked No. 
4, signed with Minnesota for $42.6 million over nine. 
</P>
<P>
 That left No. 1 Glenn Robinson and the Milwaukee Bucks locked in an ugly 
holdout. Robinson, blessed with wondrous basketball skills, looked at the other 
contracts and figured $100 million would be entirely appropriate. That, 
Milwaukee decided, is an awful lot of bratwurst. 
</P>
<P>
 John Steinmiller is the Bucks vice president for business operations, charged 
with signing players. He signed Vin Baker, Milwaukee's first-round pick last 
year at No. 8, to a 10-year contract, paying him between $650,000 and $700,000 
for his rookie season in a deal that averages a reported $1.5 million per year. 
He signed Eric Mobley, the Bucks' other first-rounder this year, for four years 
and a reported $4.64 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He fielded Robinson's $100 million bid coolly. "He has a right to ask for it," 
Steinmiller said. "It's a question of where we end up." 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee countered with $60 million offer for nine years, an average of 
nearly $7 million per season. That's a lot of bucks for the Bucks, a team where 
nobody made over $2 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides wound up somewhere in between, finally agreeing to terms on 
Thursday, one day before the start of the season. If Robinson did not break the 
bank, he came close enough -- closer, in fact, than Dallas' Kidd, Detroit's 
Hill and Minnesota'a Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie numbers are stunning. Something seems a little whacky here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in the league wonders about it," said Steinmiller, chancellor of 
the exchequer for the Bucks. "It evolved over a period of time. These guys come 
out of college to teams that need them and they put a premium on them. Starting 
at the top, agents try for 20-30% increases from year to year. Teams are in the 
5-10% range. This is why there is talk of a rookie salary cap." 
</P>
<P>
 Not in union leader Grantham's office, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an easy solution, not necessarily the right one," Grantham said. "It's 
not the fault of the rookies. It's the cap on the other side that causes the 
problem. We are opposed to caps within caps." 
</P>
<P>
 Grantham's players have noticed the fancy numbers tossed around to the new 
players. "No question, the veterans feel it's a question of resource 
allocation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is this: You are worth what someone is willing to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 There's another way to look at all of this. 
</P>
<P>
 The league charged Toronto and Vancouver $125 million apiece for their 
expansion franchises. Put a couple of rookies together and they could buy the 
next expansion team and have plenty left over to spend on incidentals.

BASEBALL; LEE SMITH COULD FILL ONE OF RANGERS' NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM KEEGAN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Texas Rangers decided not to exercise the option on closer Tom Henke's 
contract, which leaves them with a roster that has one pitcher (Cris Carpenter) 
with as many as seven career saves (earned in 24 opportunities). 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore Orioles closer Lee Smith is a free agent. Texas manager Johnny Oates 
had an excellent working relationship with Smith, never using him more than one 
inning, almost never using him in a non-save situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangers General Manager Doug Melvin felt jilted when the Orioles hired Phil 
Regan as manager, preventing Regan from interviewing for the Rangers' managing 
vacancy when it was Melvin who first mentioned Regan as a viable managerial 
candidate when Melvin was working for the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith indicated at the All-Star Game in Pittsburgh that he might want to sign 
with a club closer to his home in Castor, La., so that he could spend more time 
with his ailing father. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Melvin only has made preliminary contact with Smith's 
representatives, Chicago-based Speakers of Sport. But Melvin has a $35 million 
budget for 1995, needs a closer, and would like nothing better than to help his 
team by hurting the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles want to re-sign Smith to anchor what could become the league's 
best bullpen, considering they would have Armando Benitez for a full season to 
team with fellow hard-throwing Alan Mills in a setup role. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite uncertainy regarding the economic rules that govern the game, the 
Yankees acted swiftly in retaining Paul O'Neill, their most important free 
agent. The Orioles allowed Smith to test the market, gambling they won't lose 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oates will have a more conventional setup for his coaching staff than fired 
predecessor Kevin Kennedy, the new Boston Red Sox manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's bullpen coach Perry Hill spent games in the dugout, working with 
infielders. Meanwhile, Rangers pitchers sometimes warmed up pitchers and Jose 
Canseco's infamous relief appearance included an unsupervised warmup in which 
he threw as hard as he could, then blew out his elbow in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Oates' bullpen coach, Larry Hardy, will be stationed in the bullpen. Imagine 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers led the AL in blown saves (20) and had the league's fourth-highest 
bullpen ERA (5.28). 
</P>
<P>
 "That might have caused problems getting relievers ready to pitch in a 
ballgame," Oates said of the previous arrangement. "Larry will make sure our 
pitchers are prepared mentally and physically to get people out." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to trying to improve the Rangers' relief corps, Oates will 
concentrate on getting the Rangers to play better defense. The Rangers ranked 
last in the league in fielding percentage for the second time in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Rockies General Manager Bob Gebhard summed up the reason for little 
activity on the free-agent front. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been $600 million drawn out of the sport (by strike-lost 
revenues)," Gebhard said. "You'd like to get things done, but what are the 
numbers going to be? The players will want to build off what they made last 
year. I don't know, in light of the lost revenues, that the owners will be 
prepared to give that kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago White Sox first baseman Frank Thomas became the 11th player and second 
first baseman to win back-to-back MVP awards. The others, by position: 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher: Yogi Berra, New York (AL) 1954-55; First base: Jimmie Foxx, 
Philadelphia (AL) 1932-33; second base: Joe Morgan, Cincinniati 1975-76; third 
base: Mike Schmidt, Philadelphia 1980-81; shortstop: Ernie Banks, Chicago (NL) 
1958-59; outfield: Roger Maris, New York (AL) 1960-61; Mickey Mantle, New York 
(AL) 1956-57; Barry Bonds, Pittsburgh-San Francisco 1992-93; Dale Murphy, 
Atlanta 1982-83; pitcher: Hal Newhouser, Det 1944-45. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, one day after Thomas won his second straight AL MVP Award, 
Phillies GM Lee Thomas informed special assignments scout Jay Hankins that he 
wouldn't be offered a contract for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Hankins was the Phillies' scouting director in 1989 when the Phils used the 
fourth overall pick to take outfielder Jeff Jackson from Chicago's Simeon High 
School. Jackson batted .177 at Double-A Reading last year and was dropped from 
the 40-man roster after the season. Three picks after Jackson was taken, the 
White Sox chose Thomas. Turns out, Jackson was No. 1 on the White Sox list, 
Thomas No. 2 that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hankins was replaced by Mike Arbuckle as scouting director after the 1992 
season but remained with the organization until last week. Hankins' four drafts 
yielded only three players who have made it to the majors: shortstop Kevin 
Stocker, right-hander Mike Williams and catcher Mike Lieberthal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Indians again rehired a coach they fired a few years before. 
Last year, hitting coach Charlie Manuel was brought back four years after he 
was fired in favor of Jose Morales. Last week, the Indians hired Mark Wiley as 
pitching coach three years after they demoted him to special assignment scout. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley, 45, replaces Orioles manager Phil Regan on Mike Hargrove's staff. The 
finalists for the job that went to Wiley: former Dodgers pitching coach Ron 
Perranoski, former Red Sox pitching coach Bill Fischer, former Astros pitching 
coach Bob Cluck, former San Diego Padres pitching coach Pat Dobson and highly 
regarded Padres minor league pitching coach Dan Warthan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians have had eight pitching coaches since 1985: Wiley twice, Don 
McMahon, Jack Aker, Steve Comer, Dom Chiti, Rick Adair, and Regan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels hope to land free agent power hitter Mickey Tettleton and make him 
their starting first baseman, as well as a backup outfielder and catcher and 
No. 5 hitter. The Angels' $23.3 million payroll was the lowest in the American 
League last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also have an interest in free-agent strarting pitcher Kevin Gross, 
who was on course to pitch 200 innings for the eighth time in the past 10 years 
when the strike hit. The Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, and Texas Rangers 
also have an interest in Gross, whose signing will not cost a team a draft 
choice because the Dodgers did not offer him salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles hope to do better than Gross in their pursuit of pitching, but 
wouldn't Tettleton be a nice fit if the Orioles do not re-sign designated 
hitter Harold Baines? Tettleton could serve as DH, third catcher and emergency 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All parties interested in signing free-agent right-hander Bobby Witt should be 
advised that in 12 starts away from Oakland Coliseum, Witt went 2-7 with a 6.30 
ERA. ... Montreal Expos President Claude Brochu on the proposed United Baseball 
League: "Oh, you mean the Union Baseball League? What makes me laugh is that I 
understand they're going to have a salary cap. I wonder what Don Fehr thinks of 
that."... Andre Dawson is doing a promotional tour of his book "Hawk." In it, 
Dawson says 1994 was his last season, although he has left the door open for a 
return. "I might play next year. I won't call anyone, but I might play. 
Otherwise, I'll spend time with my family." And then? "I'd like to get into 
baseball administration."... Bert Blyleven, hired last month as Angels' Class A 
pitching coach at Cedar Rapids, resigned to become the director of sports 
ministry at his church. "This just came up," Blyleven said. "I know the Angels 
were surprised, but this is God's way of telling me I shouldn't leave. I still 
eventually want to manage in the minor leagues, and one day go to the major 
league level. But not now. I have two boys, 12 and 11, and I just don't want to 
go six months without seeing them." Uh, Bert: Did you want to go six months 
without seeing them when you took the job?. ... The Oakland Athletics' 308 
relief appearances tied Boston for the league lead, making it four years in a 
row Tony La Russa has made the most pitching changes in the AL. Oakland's 
bullpen led the AL with 370 innings. ... Right-hander Darren Driefort, the No. 
1 draft choice of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1993, has a torn ligament in his 
right elbow. A decision on whether to operate, which likely would sideline him 
for 1995, is expected in the next month. ... The San Diego Padres, in the 
market for a third baseman, have an interest in Tim Wallach, whose proposal to 
the Dodgers of a one-year, $2.65 million deal, plus an option year, was 
rejected. Wallach is scheduled to meet with the Padres on Thursday. The Padres 
also might have an interest in trading for Houston third baseman Ken Caminiti 
and one of the Astros' shortstops, Andujar Cedeno or Orlando Miller, in 
exchange for outfielder Derek Bell. ... Davey Lopes, not retained by the 
Orioles as first base coach, is a candidate for a similar vacancy with the 
Padres. ... Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson, a coach for Joe Torre with the New 
York Mets and Atlanta Braves, has been added to Torre's staff in St. Louis.

STUDENTS TACKLING 3 STATE BALLOT MEASURES; IMMIGRATION, CRIME AND SMOKING 
INITIATIVES SPUR YOUTHS TO LOBBY, RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With his hands shaking and heart racing, Tony Zepeda stood nervously at the 
microphone before a dozen Los Angeles City Council members and implored them to 
oppose Proposition 184. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want you to vote for your people, not for the seats you sit in now," the 
18-year-old South-Central youth told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 After 40 minutes of deliberation and 10 minutes of voting, the council last 
week approved a resolution, which Zepeda and several other youths worked on for 
months, opposing the "three strikes" initiative. The measure would bolster the 
state's "three strikes" law, which would render a life sentence for anyone with 
three felony convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, 16 of Zepeda's peers and a cluster of supporters rallied in an 
after-school protest against Proposition 188, a tobacco industry-sponsored 
initiative on smoking regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 With four of their faces covered in the white-and-black visage of the Grim 
Reaper, the students marched briefly at the corner of Florence and Vermont 
avenues, carrying signs and chanting against both the initiative and smoking. 
"We are sick of the proliferation of tobacco products in our community," 
Katynja McCory, 16, shouted to onlookers. "As teens we are vulnerable to 
secondhand smoke. . . . Our lives, your lives are not for sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Zepeda and two dozen other South-Central youths are tackling some of the 
hottest issues to hit California in years -- immigration, crime and smoking 
measures -- in a campaign that has taken them to the streets, to the state 
Capitol and to communities throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, which would bar illegal immigrants from schools and other 
public services, has galvanized student protests across Los Angeles, frequently 
sparking impromptu school walkouts. Zepeda and his peers, however, are involved 
in a more organized effort. They work under the umbrella of the South-Central 
based Community Coalition Against Substance Abuse, a nonprofit organization 
that has campaigned against the rebuilding of liquor stores destroyed in the 
1992 riots.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that we can tell our grandchildren, that we made a 
difference here," Zepeda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their experience on the streets and problems entangling friends, neighbors and 
family are the primary inspiration for many of the kids, who spend hours of 
their free time organizing, rallying and speaking to groups. Zepeda himself was 
a gang member for 1 1/2 years in high school and watched friends die at the 
hands of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us are reformed youth trying to make a difference," he said. "We were 
caught up in the whole crime situation, in drugs, drinking, but we changed 
ourselves around and now are trying to help change things for other people." 
</P>
<P>
 The youths have been ignited with a fervor that carried them to Sacramento in 
August to lobby elected officials about Proposition 187, and to City Hall to 
fight Proposition 184. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say youth don't care about what's going on, but that's not 
true," said Anita Wells, 15, a worker at the Community Coalition and a member 
of its South-Central Youth Empowered Thru Action, which organized events 
against the "three strikes" measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Like several of the students, Wells discovered the Community Coalition's youth 
groups after reading newspaper advertisements targeting youths interested in 
getting involved in their South-Central communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In youth groups such as South-Central Youth Empowered Thru Action, Teen 
Tobacco Awareness Project and the Graffiti Erasing Team, Latino and African 
American teens have been working together on ballot issues since March. The 25 
students work at paid after-school jobs with the Community Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if people were just given the opportunity to say what's on their mind 
or to learn about things that are going on, you'd find that there really are 
more kids who are interested in doing something," said Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 The students' determination impressed Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who 
introduced the motion for the resolution against the "three strikes" 
initiative. "It's not often that a group of young people . . . sink their teeth 
into a legislative issue and try to sway elected officials," Ridley-Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Coalition's work with the youth is "a very deliberate attempt to 
raise awareness of the next generation," said Karen Bass, executive director of 
the organization, which relies on government grants and private contributions 
for funding and which has more than 500 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Though guided and assisted by adult Community Coalition employees, the passion 
and frustration the students display over these issues is their own. 
</P>
<P>
 At a community meeting in West Hollywood recently, Zepeda, 18, and Jabari 
Bettes, 16, urged a group of middle-class voters to look for better ways to 
curb crime than Proposition 184. 
</P>
<P>
 "Building state prisons is not the way to stop crime," Bettes told the 
audience. "Before you stop any crime you have to deal with some of the problems 
that lead to that: health care, housing, educational improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the students made a final "Get Out the Vote" walk through the 
Chesterfield Square neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt like I could make a difference, but just . . . getting support 
from (the Community Coalition) has helped me see some progress that we've 
made," said Odell Wells, 16.

GIRL'S DEATH HAUNTS DORSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRETT MAHONEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anitra Jolie Watson had transferred to Dorsey High School just last spring, 
but the 17-year-old's slaying last weekend nevertheless has wrenched many 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Capricorn Clark, 16, was Watson's "play sister," she said. They resembled one 
another and shared the same birthday. In school on Monday, after the discovery 
of Watson's body, the girls' chemistry teacher three times mistakenly called 
Capricorn "Jolie," Watson's nickname. It scared her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me think that that could have been me," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson's body was discovered shot execution style in an unoccupied 
Inglewood-area duplex. The cheerleader was last seen Oct. 28 after the Dorsey 
football game, driving her white Nissan Pulsar, behind three men in a dark 
Buick Regal, police said. No motive has been determined. The City Council on 
Thursday offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing just outside the football field where Watson once practiced with the 
cheerleading squad, a handful of her friends looked through their recently 
taken photos that showed them clowning with a smiling Watson. They remembered 
her as vivacious and, despite her petite frame, as "always eating something." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before this slaying, some Dorsey students were haunted by nightmares of 
attending their friends' funerals. In little more than a year there have been a 
number of shootings on or near the campus or involving Dorsey students. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few weeks ago, on Oct. 19, a teen-ager, who was not a Dorsey student, 
was shot to death after an argument broke out during a pickup basketball game 
at the nearby Rancho Cienega Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, two popular Dorsey High students, Jose Tizcareno, 17, and Jose 
Alvarez, 18, were slain in the cross-fire between black and Latino gangs in 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, a 15-year-old boy, an innocent bystander to an argument, 
was shot and critically wounded while waiting on line to register for classes 
at Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 Most victims were in the "wrong place at the wrong time," police said, but 
this explanation was insufficient for those still having bad dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did this happen?" "How could it happen to someone so young?" "Isn't this 
unfair?" "Could that have been me?" are the questions most frequently asked by 
students when one of their own is taken by random violence, according to Sandra 
Cox, Dorsey's school psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said she is honest with students. She tells them life offers no 
guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is a gamble but you can minimize your risks. You don't have to be a 
sitting duck, sitting in front of a house, in a group with everyone wearing the 
same color, in a neighborhood known for drive-bys," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help students explore their fear and grief, a crisis team of four 
additional school psychologists was imported into Dorsey from surrounding 
schools Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Counseling was offered throughout the day, and during the next few weeks Cox 
will follow up with students who were particularly disturbed by Watson's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal Beverley Clarkson said the school encourages the students 
to express their thoughts and feelings about the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tizcareno and Alvarez were killed, their classmates organized a memorial 
service in the school library at which they read poetry about their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Two security guards patrol the 1,800-student campus during the day, 
cooperating with the Los Angeles Police Department to ensure that students can 
get to and from school without incident, Clarkson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to make Dorsey a safe haven for students," Clarkson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an isolated case when violence actually happens on campus. 
Unfortunately schools are not immune from bizarre craziness," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, Watson's close friend, agreed but it did not ease her sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried when I walked past the picture of Jolie and the other cheerleaders in 
the B wing. I couldn't help it," she said.

KISSING THE 19TH CENTURY GOODBY; WITH "MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN' BEHIND HER, 
HELENA BONHAM CARTER VOWS TO GET AWAY FROM PERIOD MOVIES. BUT SHE'S DONE SO 
WELL AS THE PRIM AND PROPER ENGLISH LADY. (EXCEPT FOR THE STRIPPING THING.)

<P>
 Helena Bonham Carter, whose face one might think could save the British film 
industry if there were a British film industry, is sitting on a bench somewhere 
inside the secret gardens of the Hotel Bel-Air, yes, having tea. 
</P>
<P>
 But as you get closer, the picture of her is not exactly right -- or exactly 
Edwardian at least. The late-afternoon light rests softly on her rising 
cheekbones; she is wearing a muted floral print dress that reaches down to her 
black socks and white canvas sneakers; the beguiling pair of dark eyes and 
eyebrows are acutely familiar from her roles on screen as E.M. Forster 
heroines. But, but . . . two of her fingers are down inside that cup, poking 
into the hot water, pinching the tea bag to squeeze the essence of Twinings 
more to her liking. It is a practical method, but one nonetheless that would 
never go with cucumber sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The English know how to make tea, but I'm not a great tea drinker," she says. 
"We don't have regular tea in the afternoon at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Helena Bonham Carter would like to point out, in fact, that she is not nearly 
so English or proper as some people assume after seeing her in "A Room With a 
View," "Howards End" and "Where Angels Fear to Tread," not to mention in Franco 
Zeffirelli's "Hamlet," playing Ophelia to Mel Gibson's brooding prince. 
</P>
<P>
 She has certainly done some other un-Edwardian things, such as play the wife 
of Lee Harvey Oswald in an American television movie, take off her clothes as a 
working-class stripper in a British TV movie last year and, most recently, be 
cast as the wife of a New York sportswriter in Woody Allen's new film, which 
has started shooting in New York. Can this be true? 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother got married at the beginning of the month," she says, retracing 
her recent jet-lagged itinerary. "I did the wedding, got totally drunk, then 
got on a plane the next morning and then started filming on the Woody Allen 
(movie) on Monday, which was stupid." She says it was a nice wedding. "Very 
nice wedding. Very nice. Very romantic. You need to relax sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 But relaxation is over and now she has taken leave of the Allen set and flown 
into Los Angeles for the premiere of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," director 
Kenneth Branagh's foray into big-budget cinema for TriStar. She is the film's 
leading lady, Victor Frankenstein's adopted sister, Elizabeth, and the love of 
his life. Branagh himself plays Frankenstein and Robert De Niro the monster he 
creates in an attempt to cheat death. 
</P>
<P>
 A story this morning in the Wall Street Journal handicapping the fall movies 
has described her as an actress "known only to the art-house crowd," a 
description she says suits her fine even though it was used against her in 
predicting the box-office potential for the picture. "I'm happy being an 
art-house person. I'd much rather that than the reverse. I'm not that famous, 
and frankly, I'd like to keep the fame in a sort of limited amount." 
</P>
<P>
 Such words always sound eerie, as if sure to be followed by a crack of thunder 
and a lightning bolt when uttered within cruising range of Morton's, and, as it 
happens, tend to carry an accent other than American. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you mind if I smoke a cigarette?" she asks her interviewer. "I wonder if 
it's illegal?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regular tea drinker or not, Bonham Carter, who attended the exclusive 
Westminster school in London, then passed up a university education to become 
an actress, comes from a prominent British political family. Her 
great-grandfather Herbert Henry Asquith was the last Liberal Party prime 
minister, the political leader of Great Britain at the outbreak of World War I. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not that posh, though," she says. "There's a misconception here that 
I'm very aristocratic, which I'm not. We have no country house, we're not very 
blue-blooded. Another misconception about me is that I'm terribly English. But 
my mother is French-Spanish, and, in fact, my looks take after her, and yet 
(the British press) have resolutely called me 'English rose,' although I don't 
have the blue eyes and the blond hair. I'm only 50% Anglo-Saxon, but they've 
been blinded by my name I guess. It sounds so English." 
</P>
<P>
 She seemed the prime specimen of Edwardian nubility in the Merchant Ivory 
adaptations of Forster's "A Room With a View," in which she played the 
repressed young lady awakened to sex while on a holiday in Italy, and "Howards 
End," in which she was Helen, the passionate sister driven to distraction by 
her concern for the unfortunate clerk put out of work by the imperious Anthony 
Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
 But even these roles, she says, have been too quickly relegated in the movie 
press to limited status as period-piece decoration. "Helen was absolutely 
bonkers," she says of her "Howards End" role. "I loved her. She's off the wall 
and very up front and expressive, and yet people are determined to talk about 
me as being in period costume drama playing repressed characters. Well, I don't 
think that's totally accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 As Bonham Carter unloads these minor frustrations and sets the record 
straight, she does so with a minimum of anger or irritation. At 28, she seems 
to have retained a capacity to be amused by the trials of show business. She 
laughs easily, in a low rumble that can go on for a sentence or two. 
</P>
<P>
 About her role in the Woody Allen picture, she says, "I have no idea what I'm 
doing. It's contemporary, it's a romantic love story, a comedy, and I'm 
attempting to be American and contemporary -- indeed, I'm attempting to be 
contemporary ." Big laugh. "I'm his wife -- from Mrs. Frankenstein to Mrs. 
Allen." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," her feverish gentility gives way to some 
bodice-ripping ardor in a role that Branagh and his screenwriters largely 
invented to add a romantic dimension to Shelley's original horror story.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't actually that enthusiastic about playing this part to begin with 
because, for obvious reasons, it was another period role," she says. "I've done 
a few too many period roles perhaps for my own good. At least in E.M. Forster 
they tend to be the central parts and they tend to be stronger than the men's 
roles. But with a Gothic horror story they tend to be passive and rather like 
the damsel-in-distress kind of part. They don't do the interesting things -- 
like make the monsters, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Branagh talked her into it by promising to make Elizabeth his equal. The 
director did this by reconceiving Elizabeth as more like Mary Shelley herself.  
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest part of the script development was bringing her on screen," 
Branagh says. "This was a remarkable woman, who eloped at 16 with a married man 
with two kids; at 19 she had written this nightmarish tale, was married to a 
superstar (poet Percy Bysshe Shelley); she lost kids in childbirth, her mother 
died giving birth to her; she was haunted by all these images. And she was 
Percy Shelley's equal intellectually. 
</P>
<P>
 "So that was my idea, to bring Mary Shelley on board, have an equal partner 
who gives him an alternative to his obsession: work versus home, ambition 
versus love." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonham Carter and Branagh met in 1988 when both took part in a poetry reading 
on a boat floating down the Thames. She saw him again when she worked with 
Branagh's wife, Emma Thompson, who won an Oscar for playing her sister in 
"Howards End."  
</P>
<P>
 "But we'd never actually sat down and had a proper conversation, we figured 
out," the actress says. "When I went up for the interview (for 'Frankenstein'), 
it was all very, 'Oh, love your work' and 'Yes, love yours,' and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Was it different working for a director who, unlike James Ivory, was also the 
leading man? 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly was because he's wearing funny clothes when he's giving you 
notes. And the first day or so I was a little paranoid that while acting 
opposite me, he's meanwhile taking notes about my bad acting. But it got 
better. Now I'm getting Ken one day and Woody another; I'm getting used to the 
director being the leading man." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always admired her," Branagh says, "because she started right in the 
limelight. The idea of being in a movie like 'Room With a View' when you're 18, 
you know, and hanging in there and getting better and not sort of being thrown 
by the whole thing is indicative of a very strong and resilient artist." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the international reputation she established in the decade since 
"Room With a View," she apparently still was not a big enough star to make 
TriStar executives thrilled about Branagh's choice. "I don't think they wanted 
an English actress, let alone me, because I was too sort of art-housey for 
them," she says. "I think a bit of an argument went on, but Ken got his way." 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone from New York, Woody Allen recalls how he came to cast her in his 
new movie.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had only seen her in passing in some of those Merchant Ivory films and 
someone suggested her to me," Allen says. "The question was, of course, could 
she be contemporary? I saw no reason why she couldn't, but I wasn't 100% sure. 
But as soon as you meet her, you realize she is a totally contemporary person 
who's really been playing roles over the years.  
</P>
<P>
 "And when she's free to play who she actually is, when she's not bound in by 
corsets -- not that she hasn't done that great, she has -- but in fact, I think 
she's more potent, more interesting and more beautiful as a contemporary 
heroine. If I had known her then, she would have made a good character for 
'Bullets Over Broadway.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bonham Carter has spent what she describes as a "really minimal" amount of 
time in Los Angeles, mainly for publicity purposes from time to time. "I can't 
say that I know Los Angeles," she says inhaling a cigarette deeply and 
pondering the subject at hand. "I wonder if there's anything to know? I sort of 
feel there's an empty center to it. It seems incredibly attractive and is very 
seductive given the weather and everything, although I don't think I could live 
in a place that is quite so seasonless. And it is so completely different from 
where I come from, which is London." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in London, she has attracted more than a little curiosity over the fact 
that she still lives with her parents in the house she grew up in. Her mother 
is a psychotherapist, her father a retired merchant banker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no great psychological thing to it, though people try to make it into 
something more significant than it is. I mean, I just get on with them. My 
brothers moved out, married, and I didn't. Also, I never went to university or 
drama school, which is when most kids move out. So it never really occurred to 
me. I always had a great amount of freedom and privacy -- and I move around a 
lot. And they are exceptionally nice people." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this arrangement must propose a challenge for suitors? "Yes," she says, 
"a bit. But once they meet them, they want to move in. My parents are very 
liberal and deeply unshockable." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie in which she played the "strip-o-gram" stripper, "Dancing Queen" 
(which has not been seen in the United States), she insists is "definitely one 
of the best things I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's nothing salacious about it. I got to be contemporary and 
working-class and took my clothes off -- for obvious reasons. A lovely script, 
very funny. The attitude is so different toward television in England. We have 
very good television, very good writers, maybe because we have no movie 
industry.

 "I did a strip to that ABBA song, 'Dancing Queen' and 'Do You Want to Touch 
Me?' by Gary Glitter. Haven't you heard of Gary Glitter? He's an icon of 
campdom. And it was a good thing to strip to. It went, 'Do you want to touch 
me? There? Where? There? Yeah.' It was pretty direct. It got the point over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had Velcro hearts stuck in various strategic places that came off. It was 
great fun to do, although I could never get my bra off. It was probably deeply 
psychosomatic, but it had to happen on the beat, and I thought it would be 
quite funny to have a 'strip-o-gram' who couldn't get her clothes off. But the 
director, for some reason, thought it was less effective than achieving the 
full exposure. Not that you see that much. You have about two frames worth. And 
I only had to do the top. Because frankly the bottom would have taken me so 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . I'm not a sort of natural show-off type, I don't think, and I'd 
prefer, frankly, to lose myself or hide behind a character. And if I'm 
terrified, then that's what saves me. Because you're concealing yourself or 
you're bringing out another part of yourself that you don't show in your normal 
existence." 
</P>
<P>
 In her normal existence, if it can be said that even art-house heroines have a 
normal existence, Bonham Carter listens to songs from Fred Astaire musicals, 
Cole Porter, Louis Armstrong.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty un-hip. I'm not a particular fan of rock and roll and certainly 
this acid, migraine-inducing monotonous thing that's going on. I don't get it. 
I've got a bit of credibility with Eric Clapton. I've been listening to Jacques 
Brel, but he's a bit for the suicide hour, I'd say." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Davis has been her role model since she saw her in "My Brilliant Career," 
when she was 12. "That was my favorite film," she says. "She's been a heroine 
of mine." The two finally acted together in the 1992 film of Forster's "Where 
Angels Fear to Tread." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jennifer Jason Leigh is somebody I admire a lot because she's known for being 
different in her range of choices. That kind of sequence of roles I'd love to 
have access to. Which I think is getting there bit by bit. If I play it right. 
. . . I'm leaving the ingenue, girlie type and graduating into womanhood." 
</P>
<P>
 And the fame thing she would like to keep at a comfortable distance. 
"Somewhere this side, miles, light years away from Julia Roberts, I think. And 
I think you can. The fame wasn't the thing that attracted me in the first 
place, and it's less attractive the more famous I seem to have got over the 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's true that people get trained in acting, but they don't get trained to 
deal with fame. And they may be great at taking on other people's 
personalities, but their own personality could use a lot of work."

A NEW ERA DAWNS FOR UPSHAW; A PILLAR OF NICE IN A NOT-SO-NICE BUSINESS, DAWN 
UPSHAW HAS QUIETLY BECOME A METROPOLITAN OPERA STAR THROUGH HER HONEST DEVOTION 
TO THE MUSIC AND HER PURE SOPRANO -- NOT THE THEATRICS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. HOW 
DID SOMEONE SO NORMAL MAKE IT SO BIG? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About two years ago, Dawn Upshaw suddenly became a celebrity. Already highly 
respected for singing the lighter Mozart roles, Schubert Lieder and the 
20th-Century art song, as well as concert works and opera, the press was now 
comparing her to Callas and Madonna, and to the punk classical violinist, Nigel 
Kennedy. She even was called an unlikely pop star. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet nothing about Upshaw, the American soprano appearing this week with the 
Los Angeles Philharmonic, calls to mind Kennedy, Callas or Madonna. She is not 
unkempt, rebellious or, in any way, extravagant. She does not shock; she does 
not reinvent or flaunt herself. Onstage, she demonstrates little artifice or 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing about Upshaw's manner suggests that she is a star. Yet the morning I 
met Upshaw at a cafe near Lincoln Center, her picture happened to be where 
opera singers (or living pop singers, for that matter) rarely find themselves 
-- on the front page of the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, the picture was there to announce a review inside of "Le Nozze di 
Figaro," which included the Metropolitan Opera debut of a much-hyped Welsh 
baritone, Bryn Terfel. It was with Terfel, the Figaro, that Upshaw, as Susanna, 
was pictured. But Upshaw is no small attraction herself at the Met these days 
(she's just better known), and her ovations were equal to his. 
</P>
<P>
 Upshaw's real fame, however, has been elsewhere achieved. Hers is the luminous 
soprano voice in the celebrated Nonesuch recording of Henryk Gorecki's Third 
Symphony, the super-serious, super-slow Polish symphony that has had remarkable 
appeal to both the pop and classical markets, and which has been a spectacular 
bestseller for the past two years. And now, thanks again to Nonesuch, Upshaw 
(who had previously released two Grammy-winning collections of 20th-Century 
works) seems to be winning yet more new crossover adherents with "I Wish It 
So," a music-theater disc of songs by Bernstein, Blitzstein, Sondheim and 
Weill, as well as an appearance on the latest Kronos Quartet recording, "Night 
Prayers," of mystical music from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty weird, isn't it, when you think about it?" Upshaw asks, and then 
bursts into a laugh, when she considers going from "I Feel Pretty" to the eerie 
"Lacrymosa" by Uzbekistani composer Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky, on Kronos' disc; or 
from Mozart at the Met to the ambrosial, folk-based Canteloube "Songs of the 
Auvernge" and the modernist "Flowers and Fables" by Witold Lutoslawski, works 
that she will sing this week with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. "I, of course, 
consider myself to be extremely lucky that it's so varied." 
</P>
<P>
 She also says that it all feels perfectly normal. "It feels normal when I do 
'Figaro,' which is one of the most perfectly brilliant pieces I know: it seems 
to have a life of its own. I'm just not conscious that now I'm going to sing 
classical music, or now I'm singing 19th- Century music. Maybe some people 
believe that I ought to be more conscious of the changes of style." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally Upshaw is, in fact, criticized for being too normal. Opera 
singers -- and sopranos, in particular -- are expected to be somewhat 
temperamental. But it is also that lack of pretense, the honest devotion to the 
music being sung or, in opera, the character being portrayed, along with the 
sheer reliability of her technique and the purity of sound, that has made 
Upshaw seem such a breath of fresh air in a not always nice or idealistic 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in person, Upshaw seems pretty much as she does on stage. When she 
arrives no more than two minutes late for the interview (she had already called 
ahead and warned that she might get delayed in traffic), she is all apologies. 
She appears genuinely bemused and disbelieving that her picture is on the front 
page of the New York Times. Her manner and dress are so unpretentious that, in 
jeans and a sweater, she could be any Upper West Sider, so she attracts no 
stares of recognition when we later walk over to the Met. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is to suggest, however, that Upshaw -- who at 34 seems to be 
entering into her vocal prime and a new interpretive confidence -- lacks 
character or personality. Indeed, the key to Upshaw's communicability seems to 
be the deep and essential way she internalizes what she sings, which then 
allows her a certain outer flexibility. And her commercial and artistic triumph 
in the Gorecki Third Symphony is, perhaps, a perfect, if curious, example of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Upshaw recorded the Gorecki three years ago, she was a singer 
well-known to vocal connoisseurs but hardly beyond. After having sung small 
roles at the Met since 1984, she got her big break in 1988, replacing an 
indisposed Kathleen Battle in Donizetti's 'L'Elisir d'Amore.' She developed a 
reputation as an adroit Mozart singer and recorded Susanna for James Levine on 
Deutsche Grammophon but also worked with early music specialists, singing 
Pamina in Roger Norrington's recording of "Die Zauberflote." She was also a 
respected recitalist with the rare interest in contemporary American music, 
including that of former Los Angeles Philharmonic composer-in-residence John 
Harbison, whom she has championed. 
</P>
<P>
 Upshaw had proven that she could reach surprisingly diverse audiences when her 
Nonesuch recording of Samuel Barber's "Knoxville: Summer of 1915" (which also 
included Harbison's exotic "Mirabai Songs" and probably the best performance 
Anne Trulove's aria, "No Word from Tom," from Stravinsky's "The Rake's 
Progress" had ever gotten) proved both a bestseller and Grammy winner. The 
follow-up, "The Girl With Orange Lips" (with more obscure repertoire, including 
works by Ravel, Falla, Stravinsky, Earl Kim and Maurice Delage) did equally 
well in the stores and with the Grammy jury. 
</P>
<P>
 But hardly anyone would have thought of Upshaw in terms of Gorecki's symphony, 
let alone real celebrity. The symphony had already been thrice recorded by 
Polish soprano Stefania Woytowicz, a very different sort of singer. "I, too, 
when I first got the piece, wasn't showing very much imagination myself," 
Upshaw says, recalling being approached by Nonesuch's Robert Hurwitz to record 
the vocal parts in the symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction came from listening. I heard the big huge voice on the 
recording he sent me, those big long tones and the huge phrases, and I thought 
he's got to be kidding, I can't do this. But since I was very moved by the 
piece and by the text, I called Bob and said that I was not sure about it, and 
let me spend some more time with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I looked at the music, and I thought, 'You know, I don't think it has to 
be that way. I think it could be successful done the way I need to do it.' And 
once I had decided to look at it differently, I was convinced." 
</P>
<P>
 It could even be argued that it was precisely because Upshaw approached the 
music differently that the symphony became the phenomenon it did, the 
best-selling serious work by a living composer in anyone's memory, with a long 
life on the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
 A symphony in three slow movements, with sung texts of sorrowful lamentations 
of a mother's loss of child -- from the 15th Century, from a folk source and, 
most disturbingly, from concentration camp graffiti -- the score can seem 
woeful to an unbearable degree when sung by Woytowicz, as one loses the message 
in the sheer weeping. Upshaw, however, with her great emphasis on text, but 
without the overblown vocal gestures, allows one to listen through to the 
symphony's message, creating a uniquely powerful experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Something similar happens in the equally unlikely seeming success of Upshaw's 
new recording of songs from musical theater, which she also admits is something 
of a leap for her. "I probably notice more of a difference between the 'I Wish 
It So' repertory and the changes of style with the other things that I do, than 
between the Mozart and the other things that I do," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But while the colloquial nature of these songs draws me a little further 
away, I'm still not conscious of singing differently. I'm conscious of using 
the language differently, and I'm conscious of singing lower. But that's OK. I 
can't stand any categorizing of singers that tries to keep you within a certain 
range." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the naturalness to her singing of musical theater is simply that of 
being an American who grew up in the Midwest -- in Park Forest, Ill., near 
Chicago -- in a family that enjoyed folk singing, and of her hearing the 
musical theater style of work all her life. "It's true that I did go to college 
thinking that I was going to try to make it in music theater," Upshaw further 
notes. "But I think that a lot of American singers of my generation probably 
grew up with this music. This is, at least, what I was hearing a lot more than 
Mozart or Schubert." 
</P>
<P>
 But again, as in the Gorecki, much of the music on the album is not exactly 
familiar -- an effort was made to include a few little-known gems, along with 
more familiar songs, as it was to emphasize composers who had similarly serious 
notions about music theater and had written both for music theater and opera. 
Moreover, many of the songs come from roles that Upshaw finds personally remote 
from her own experiences, so once more she had to find her own personal way 
into the music. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the Stephen Sondheim song, "Like It Was," from "Merrily We Roll 
Along," is the expression of a character whose experience, Upshaw notes, is far 
from her own. "It was hard for me to imagine being an alcoholic in my late 
'40s, looking back on a relationship unlike any relationship I've ever had. I'm 
asked to use my imagination like that all the time. But somehow with this 
Sondheim song I feel like I especially had to make it work for me." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case that means singing a song full of bitter irony about having been 
really nice in an authentically nice manner, which turns the irony upside down 
upon itself, and, as in the Gorecki, seems all the more moving because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 An even more telling example, though, of just how effectively Upshaw can do 
this happened when she tried out this repertoire for the first time in a 
cabaret setting, at the Supper Club in Manhattan. She introduced one number by 
telling the audience that, as she had just given birth to her second child, the 
song had become her personal daily therapy. It was "I Feel Pretty," from "West 
Side Story," and Upshaw sang it as it surely had never been sung before, with a 
happy irony added to every phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 That also brings up another major aspect of Upshaw's career, which is her 
family life. Anyone who has regularly observed her will remember recitals from 
a very pregnant Upshaw, four years ago, before her first child was born, 
although last spring she was able to disguise her pregnancy with a nun's habit, 
when she appeared at the Met in a celebrated performance of Poulenc's 
"Dialogues of the Carmelites." 
</P>
<P>
 Balancing her family -- husband Michael Nott is a musicologist -- and 
performances, especially in opera, is something that she has often commented 
upon. "It's not easy," she confesses. "The last thing I want to happen is for 
this business and performing to become my life, for everything to work around 
it, to be possessed by my thoughts about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I have realized over the years is that music and my performing is so 
tangled up in my life that the more I appreciate my relationships with people, 
the more I appreciate music, and the more extraordinary my relationship with 
music becomes. So having a family and having children just really helps keep my 
perspective of things. It makes it hard for me to travel; it's hard for me to 
practice as much as I used to. So I need to do a little bit less and maybe 
travel less and balance all of that out." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the moment Upshaw seems to be managing a remarkable supermom act, 
impressively in control of her life, which may be what gave her Susanna a 
special sense of purpose. Still, she has an extraordinary schedule -- 
extraordinary not just in quantity but in variety -- of performances in concert 
and opera and of recordings. She will be recording the Lutoslawski with 
Esa-Pekka Salonen, directly following the Los Angeles performances, for Sony 
(her recent Sony CD of Debussy's "La Damoiselle Elue" with Salonen and the 
Philharmonic has been much praised), and that will be followed by a Debussy 
song disc, accompanied by Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 This winter and spring she will be offering a a number of new and recent 
American works by Harbison, Jacob Druckman and Robert Beaser. She will sing her 
first Sophie in "Der Rosenkavalier" at the Houston Opera. In the summer she 
records roles ranging from Maria in "West Side Story," with Leonard Slatkin and 
the Washington Opera, to Anne Trulove in "The Rake's Progress" with Kent Nagano 
and the Lyon Opera (with whom she has just released an Erato disc of the 
Canteloube songs she is singing at the Music Center). 
</P>
<P>
 After that, she says that she will find herself in Europe for half of next 
year in opera productions. But that isn't something she plans to repeat again 
in the near future, since her daughter will be entering school, and she doesn't 
want to leave her for long periods. Still, no one seems particularly worried. 
If Upshaw has proven anything in her career, it is that she is versatile and 
that those things that mean the most to her find their way into her music in 
ways that makes them mean something to everyone else as well. 
</P>

A DUET OF RIGHT AND WRONG; THEIR ART IS NOT THE SAME, BUT THEIR CONCERNS ARE. 
CHOREOGRAPHER WINIFRED R. HARRIS AND POP ARTIST ME'SHELL NDEGEOCELLO ARE 
COLLABORATING ON A PROJECT FUELED BY THEIR FRUSTRATION WITH TODAY'S WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Breslauer, Jan Breslauer is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Choreographer Winifred R. Harris and recording artist Me'Shell NdegeOcello are 
seated on the hardwood floor of a Cal State Los Angeles rehearsal room, 
chatting about their work as dancers dress to leave. Five-year-old Askia 
NdegeOcello wanders nearby, exploring the space and scoring the proceedings 
with periodic sharp toots on his plastic flute. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' long wild locks and delicate gold nose-ring contrast with 
NdegeOcello's Spartan shaved head and wire-rimmed specs. The dancer is as 
animated as her partner is laconic. But the yin-yang works surprisingly well, 
and it's more than surface deep. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women, who share an L.A. home, are making their debut as professional 
collaborators. And it's a potentially explosive artistic combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris has been riding a fast track in local modern dance circles with 
choreography marked by a vibrant mix of balletic and Afrocentric movement 
vocabularies. 
</P>
<P>
 NdegeOcello (pronounced: N-day-gay-O-chello) -- whose album "Plantation 
Lullabies" was released to acclaim last year on Maverick, Madonna's record 
label -- has broken through with energetic, assertive music that weaves 
together funk, jazz and hip-hop. This is her first time scoring concert dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as stylistically individualistic as these two artists are, they also share 
a passionate concern for social ills. "For me, the project started out of my 
frustration at watching what's going on," says Harris, referring to society's 
and pop culture's saturation with violence as well as other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' company, Between Lines, performs "What's Behind Door 1" as the kickoff 
to Black Choreographers Moving Toward the 21st Century, the fifth annual 
festival of African American dance, on Thursday. The festival's two programs 
also feature Philadanco, New York's Reggie Wilson, Dwight Rhoden and more -- 
all of whom will be offering West Coast premieres -- and will be presented 
through next Sunday as part of the inaugural season at Cal State L.A.'s new 
Harriet and Charles Luckman Fine Arts Complex. 
</P>
<P>
 This piece marks a new direction for Harris. "It's experimental in a way," she 
says of the project that the two women initiated themselves, as a result of 
their affinity for each other's work. "I feel a need to reach more people and 
sometimes through language we do that. Part of moving into words with this 
piece was we feel bombarded with all that's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's Behind Door 1" includes scenarios evoking oppressive situations, from 
enslavement to prostitution. "Some of us turn our heads away and some of us 
just quietly sit back," Harris says. "There's so much going on that we have not 
taken time to look at it and say 'does this matter to me?' And that's what's 
going on in the piece for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris and NdegeOcello may be a team, but they have pointedly different takes 
on what they do. "Dance to me -- and we fight about this all the time -- is 
like a dead art," says the soft-spoken but blunt NdegeOcello. "I'm sorry, no 
one gets it. I just don't think people come to dance concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to sound like I'm spewing off rhetoric, but it's the MTV 
generation," NdegeOcello continues. "They want something quickly and easily 
digestible. No one has an attention span past a good five minutes of 
raunchiness." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, NdegeOcello finds the medium liberating. "I'm trying to have 
experiences and write about them, but they aren't necessarily falling into an 
eight-bar chorus, an eight-bar verse and then an eight-bar chorus again, that's 
all," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Harris plays the idealist to her partner's realist. "I'm the woman 
who lives in the fairy-tale land of 'they'll get it one day, somebody will get 
it,' " she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two women are right in sync when it comes to a sense of outrage at the 
current state of affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the movie "Pulp Fiction," for instance, only confirmed Harris and 
NdegeOcello's feelings. "They made such lightness of all this killing that's 
going on and it just really bothers me," says Harris. "I've been seeing a lot 
of this (violent) element thrown into dance lately too, and it seems to me that 
it's done just for shock value." 
</P>
<P>
 And the artists have turned such outrage into grist for the mill. "I know 
violence is a part of everyday life, but I find it appalling," says 
NdegeOcello. "You become somewhat numb to it. You kind of move on. That (sense 
of shock) is what's inspiring the music." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, for both, a rejection of the contemporary tendency to turn the other 
cheek. "I believe in a lot of ways that there are no shades of gray, there just 
are right and wrong," says NdegeOcello. "It's so funny that that (kind of value 
system) is nonexistent in these times. What's in style is I can sit through a 
film and watch people die senselessly." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris is no stranger to addressing problems onstage, although she hasn't 
previously done so as explicitly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There're few dances that I've choreographed that I didn't hope would awaken 
something within people," she says. "I don't want to say all my pieces mean 
this or that. Sometimes the issues come out. My goal is to have people feel." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a desire that Harris has long been searching to express. Born and raised 
in Denver, she spent most of her professional life dancing with the 
Colorado-based Cleo Parker-Robinson Dance Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, Harris began to branch out, moving first to New York, 
before spending the 1987-88 season with the Dallas Black Dance Theatre. She 
also began to choreograph during this period. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris didn't really begin to get up steam as a choreographer, though, until 
she went to teach in Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was there, there was all this hunger for performance," she says. 
"They have this ballet company that's so greatly supported by the state, but 
there was no modern happening. I went for the summer and ended up going back 
for the fall and winter, and that's when I started really creating." 
</P>
<P>
 After Iceland, Harris returned to Colorado and Cleo Parker-Robinson to 
decompress. In 1990, she made the move to L.A., encouraged by an aunt who lives 
here and such others as the Inner City Cultural Center's C. Bernard Jackson. 
She did, however, continue to dance with the Colorado company for a while after 
relocating. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris came to critical attention here as a choreographer only last year, at 
the May, 1993, edition of the Black Choreographers Moving Toward the 21st 
Century festival at the Japan America Theatre. Her "When Wet Came to Paper," 
which she will present at this year's edition of the festival as well, uses 
some text but mostly pure movement to portray both groups and individuals 
enduring and ultimately transcending tough situations. 
</P>
<P>
 For this work, The Times' Lewis Segal called Harris "the discovery of the 
evening: a choreographer with an intriguing hybrid style that looked strongest 
in its inventive development of Africanisms but especially in its exciting pull 
or drive through the spine." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Prime Moves program at Cal State L.A. in October, 1993, Harris 
premiered the trio "Like a Deer in Headlights." Beginning with a dramatic scene 
behind a scrim, three female dancers segue first into a pop interlude, and from 
there into emotional choreography that deconstructs that ostensibly 
"all-American" idiom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like a Deer in Headlights" also marked Harris first collaboration with an 
L.A. musician, in this case Steve Moshier, a familiar talent in local 
avant-garde and experimental circles. Because their work together had to be 
completed in 10 days, though, the process wasn't as involved as Harris' current 
effort with NdegeOcello. "He came, he listened to the 16 counts that I had, he 
took it, brought it back . . . that's how we did it," says Harris. "It was 
wonderful that it worked in that quick way." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris formed Between Lines in 1991, largely as a way to facilitate her 
choreography. "I always knew I wanted to choreograph, but I never thought the 
responsibility of a company would come to me until four years from now," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if I was going to live here in Los Angeles, I had to do something that 
felt right to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, it hasn't been easy. For instance, Harris found herself somewhat 
at odds with the tryout circuit. "I didn't feel like I was one to fit into the 
big cattle-call audition," she says. "I didn't know if I moved like that. I go 
to class and I look like a modern dancer. I don't have all the glitz and 
glamour about myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Harris also found problems when it came to having a company of her own. 
Armed with rehearsal space provided by the Inner City Cultural Center, she put 
up audition notices, but the response was disappointing. "The people who come 
and audition are the people who just moved to L.A.," says Harris. "Or they're 
just like die-hard modern dancers who maybe at the time didn't have the oomph 
to go out somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 As she was searching for capable dancers, Harris was also learning the ropes 
of running a troupe. "The first six months was 'I've never run a company before 
and you've never danced in one, so let's put it together,' " she recalls. "A 
lot of people stayed with me through two or three seasons and then left to do 
other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was increasingly less willing to settle for dancers who weren't at her 
level. "It got to the point where artistically I didn't want to sacrifice 
anymore, so I couldn't use people in certain shows," she says. "I wanted to 
push for what I wanted, the caliber of the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became stressful and people decided they had to depart for those reasons, 
and of course financial reasons: They didn't get any money." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris is now able to compensate her dancers, although not as much as she'd 
like. "It became a challenge in a lot of different ways, so it became hard for 
them to stay around." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, though, she has an ensemble she can live with. Company members who 
will perform at the Luckman complex include Harris, Michelle Beauchamp, Kim T. 
Clark, Monica Dalsasso, Miko Doi-Smith, Philein Wang, Darrel Wright and 
Catherine Ybarra. 
</P>
<P>
 The security of a competent company -- as well as her first commission, from 
the festival's co-producer First Impressions Performances -- has given Harris 
the courage to try new things. So far, it has been a 24-hour-a-day gambit. "We 
live together, so it's like, 'Wake up, I have a thought,' " says NdegeOcello. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently perhaps, the piece -- which will feature a live onstage combo of 
four musicians, as well as interpolations of poetry read by NdegeOcello -- is 
ending up more theatrically complex than Harris' previous works. "The plain 
simple thing is, it has more props, more stuff, and I've never (used) a lot of 
stuff," says Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has turned up other new challenges, especially in the collaborative 
process. "Part of it is that I'm used to working with just the dancers and 
myself, with whatever is going on in my head," says Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the matter, too, of artists from two different mediums striving to 
find a common language. "You want to show all this, and your medium is dance 
and my medium is my voice, and that's where we can't critique each other," says 
NdegeOcello. "When you're working with somebody, the last thing you want to do 
is critique. To me, she's all the support I have in this piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet NdegeOcello also finds the venture freeing, especially compared to the 
strictures of songwriting and record-making. "I try to learn the choreography 
myself, so it's in my body," explains NdegeOcello. "Then I go home and try to 
bring the thought into tangible music and the dance into a tangible listening 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The other advantages are also clear. "Doing this is better than making a 
record because you see people actually being influenced and driven by the 
music, or you're creating music that was inspired by the dance," says 
NdegeOcello. "It's interesting trying to write a different bar for each dance 
step. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just more of an appreciative process," she continues. "It's probably the 
best thing you could do as a writer." 
</P>
<P>
 For Harris too, "What's Behind Door 1" could be the start of something more 
than a single new dance. "The couple of projects that I want to do right now, I 
am moving in that (theatrical) direction," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's something that I'm ready to stay in. When I say I'm moving 
in that direction, it's because I am starting to open my mouth. But I don't 
want to replace movement with words. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris is also set to appear at UCLA in March, where she is the only 
L.A.-based modern dance artist this season. "I have another piece that I have a 
proposal to do at UCLA called 'One Race Woman,' " she says. "I started working 
on it long ago, and I always wanted to enhance it in (the direction of) 
theater-dance, but never taking out the real dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, both Harris and NdegeOcello are concerned with the immediate 
reception of their first joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a fear that people will come see this piece and they'll be like 'Well, 
what are you trying to say?' " the songwriter confesses. "I'm afraid they're 
going to lambaste it because it's grappling with this stuff -- 
semi-performance, semi-dance and live music." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a fine line between art and bull----," she says. "As an artist, 
you're always (asking), 'OK, am I crossing that line?' "

THE REAL LESSON OF 'OLEANNA'?; DAVID MAMET'S PLAY IS NOW A FILM, AND WHILE 
DEFTLY EXPOSING THE COMPLEXITY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES, IT ALSO TAKES ON 
ANOTHER SUBJECT LONG OVERDUE FOR STUDY: EDUCATION.

<P>
 David Mamet's controversial play "Oleanna" was an Off Broadway sensation in 
1992 and went on to a long, successful run in London. The film version, 
directed by Mamet and based on his screenplay, opened Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 When it debuted in the wake of the 1991 Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings on 
Capitol Hill, "Oleanna" seemed to encapsulate the stormy national debate over 
sexual harassment. In its gripping dramatization of an ambiguous, increasingly 
tortured exchange between a male professor and his female student, it 
challenged the rampant political correctness of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 By showing that conflicts between superiors and subordinates are far more 
complex than conventional victim-centered feminism allowed, Mamet dared to 
suggest that both parties bear equal responsibility in any social transaction. 
"Oleanna" forces the audience to become a jury, a voyeuristic Greek chorus who 
must scrutinize the behavior of the two clashing characters and weigh their 
testimony. Different viewers will come to different conclusions. But Mamet 
incisively demonstrates that women cannot -- as too many partisans of Anita 
Hill claimed -- be automatically believed simply because they are women. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years since the first production of the play, the tide has begun to 
turn against the forces of political correctness in America. There is a 
powerful, bipartisan reform movement at work in the media and in academe that 
is systematically critiquing the excesses of feminist ideology and of fanatical 
special interests of all kinds. The trend toward campus speech codes has been 
reversed, as thoughtful liberals have begun to realize that progressive values 
cannot be achieved by totalitarian means. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the dust is settling, "Oleanna" can be seen more clearly. The early, 
largely enthusiastic reviewers of the play reduced it to its terrifying 
Inquisitional theme: The student comes to the professor's office to inquire 
about her grade and ends up, with little discernible provocation, accusing him 
of sexual harassment and rape, hysterical charges that lead to his sudden 
dismissal from his job and, as the play ends, perhaps his future arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mamet is using sex war to explore a much larger subject, one that has been 
amazingly neglected by contemporary artists and writers: education. For the 
last 20 years, arguments over American education have been polarized into a 
simplistic opposition between Right and Left. Conservatives call for a 
back-to-basics curriculum supported by traditional values of morality and 
patriotism, while many liberals demand a multicultural curriculum organized 
around "identity politics," the claims of historically oppressed groups for 
recognition and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oleanna" breaks this tiresome stalemate by isolating and examining the 
starkly skeletal structure of modern teacher-student relations. What is the 
purpose of education? Mamet asks a philosophical question that is as old as 
Socrates but that has moved to the center of the modern cultural agenda. Is 
education memorization of facts or enlargement of perspective? Is it technical 
training or general enlightenment? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In "Emile" (1762), Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the founder of Romanticism whose 
ideas helped trigger the French Revolution, argued that children's upbringing 
should follow benevolent Mother Nature rather than corrupt masculine 
civilization -- which feminism currently calls "patriarchy." Rousseau stressed 
emotion, spontaneity and self-esteem, rather than rules, rationality and book 
learning. He denied that authority figures like teachers have any special 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Rousseau's ideas remain a dominant force in educational policy and child 
psychology. His major disciples included John Dewey, whose thinking inspired 
the foundation of experimental, alternative colleges like Bennington, and Maria 
Montessori, whose relaxed program for preschoolers focuses on stimulating 
children's innate creativity rather than imposing adult expectations and 
concepts on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mamet attended Vermont's alternative Goddard College in the late 1960s, a 
turbulent decade that tried to transform the traditional American model of 
strict classroom education, devised in the 19th Century for a rapidly 
industrializing pioneer nation of farmers and immigrants. Students of the 1960s 
counterculture were demanding "relevance" in their courses, and the most 
utopian among them prophesied the birth of open universities with no entrance 
requirements, no exams, no grades, no classrooms and no hierarchy of any kind. 
Strolling through idyllic green meadows, teacher and student would be friendly 
equals in the quest for truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oleanna" bears the traces of Mamet's long reflection on these matters. 
Unfortunately, there is a bit of a time warp in his characterization of the 
professor, who talks in a smarmy, late-1960s way about the folly of pretending 
to know more than the student and who denigrates the teaching-and-testing 
format as merely sadistic "hazing" of the young. 
</P>
<P>
 This fellow's dumb, pseudo-hippie stunt of rashly promising the girl an A, 
even though the course is only half over, provides the hard evidence for her 
questionable claim of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have made more contemporary sense for Mamet to have made his callow, 
bumbling, insecure professor a slicker, more arrogant type -- like the amoral 
careerists who have sailed to the top of the Ivy League and the University of 
California by spouting esoteric French theory and feminist and Marxist 
propaganda. But "Oleanna" is devastatingly truthful about the intrusion of 
bourgeois values of comfort, security and property into a profession whose 
spiritual roots are in the monastic Middle Ages, when the scholar's life was 
ascetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Materialism and worldly ambition have corrupted the faculty of the elite 
schools, an issue completely ignored in our over-politicized culture wars. 
"Oleanna" begins with the professor frantically spluttering into the telephone, 
as he closes the deal on a prize house, the symbol of his vocational success. 
An academic committee has just granted him tenure, a lifetime guarantee of 
employment that was once meant to ensure academic freedom but that has perhaps 
become yet another enforcer of sycophancy and conformity. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl who comes as a suppliant to his office witnesses the professor's 
absorption in house and family and, in one possible interpretation, seems to 
hatch her plot out of smoldering, envious malice.  
</P>
<P>
 Mamet wavers about her class background. At first she seems economically 
deprived, unprepared for her classroom experiences among the more privileged. 
But as the play goes on, she becomes the spitting image of the naive, pampered, 
self-pitying, white middle-class girl whose princess fantasies and whining 
demands for protection and approval have so deformed feminism on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his career, from "Sexual Perversity in Chicago" and "American 
Buffalo" to "Speed-the-Plow" (Madonna's Broadway debut), Mamet has been accused 
of misogyny. His characters tend to be bluff, brusque, noisily competitive men, 
while his women are peripheral, recessive or unformed. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol, the student of "Oleanna," evolves in the play from what Helen Gurley 
Brown used to call a timid little "mouseburger" into an implacable Fury, 
lashing the defeated and destroyed professor with her newfound words. At the 
climax, she speaks not just for herself but for her "group," a shadowy, 
presumably feminist cell of humorless, book-banning, Stalinist ideologues. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Carol a misogynous caricature? As an educator of 23 years who has taught in 
a wide variety of schools, I can testify that Mamet's portrait of Carol is 
creepily accurate. She is the tyrant super-hero of American political 
correctness, which has reversed the revolutionary changes in behavior wrought 
by my bawdy, feisty 1960s generation and enslaved the image of woman to 
Victorian standards of decorum, propriety, purity and frailty. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first preview of "Oleanna" in its 1992 run at a Harvard University 
theater, Mamet was confronted by an angry band of students from Brown 
University, one of whom accused him of "political irresponsibility." Shocked 
and upset, he complained to his friend Harold Pinter, the British playwright, 
about the reactionary drift of American culture, which was stifling free 
thought and free speech and, if unchecked, would end artistic life as we know 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 I sympathize with Mamet's outrage, since after a chaotic lecture at Brown the 
same year, I was screamed at by a mob of the most infantile, irrational women I 
have ever seen in my life. These coddled, affluent students were the vicious 
Red Guards in action. At elite schools nationwide, I have been picketed and 
boycotted, and my book "Sexual Personae" has been routinely banned from most 
women's studies programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oleanna" emerges from the decades after World War II in America, when 
universal higher education, for the first time in history, became a great 
democratic ideal. But in the humanities, when "inclusiveness" was exalted over 
scholarship, standards began to decline. Therapy has become a substitute for 
intellectual inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The pleasant holiday-resort ambience of so many American campuses -- into 
which violence erupts at the end of "Oleanna" -- has become a narcotic that is 
dulling the brain and stunting student development. Colleges seem to exist 
solely, in Mamet's sharp phrase, to "artificially prolong adolescence." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking freedom, students of the 1960s rebelled against the parietal rules 
where colleges acted in loco parentis ("in place of the parent"). In contrast, 
today's students -- latchkey children of prosperous, professional parents -- 
crave attention and oversight from authority figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not your father," Mamet's professor declares to Carol. "I want 
understanding!" she later shouts at him. If our students are ever to become 
adults, and if young women are to achieve at the level of men, we must break 
the unholy marriage of servility and sanctimony that really rules campus 
politics.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; BLUESROOM OPENING HITS A HIGH NOTE

 Edwin N. Thomas chuckled when he recalled what the 5-4 Ballroom was like in 
its heyday some 45 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw James Brown here before he knew how to dance," said Thomas, 76, a 
retired postal worker who earned the moniker "Mr. 5-4 Ballroom" for his dancing 
prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic 5-4 opened the doors recently to its Bluesroom, a concert hall 
beneath the ballroom, where jazz and blues legends Miles Davis, Ella 
Fitzgerald, Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie performed to huge crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 The reopening Oct. 28 of the Bluesroom, which included a blues concert and 
presentation of 13 framed enlargements of jazz and blues commemorative stamps 
donated by the U.S. Postal Service, was a precursor to the ballroom's slated 
opening in March, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Margie Evans, the club's promoter and an accomplished blues singer, has lead 
the campaign to reopen the ballroom, working closely with club owner Oliver 
Wilson, a Cal State Dominguez Hills political science professor with a keen 
interest in the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 5-4 Ballroom is to South-Central Los Angeles what the Apollo Theater is 
to Harlem," said Evans, who has performed extensively here and abroad and has 
five CDs out on European labels.  
</P>
<P>
 The two-story brick building was built in 1922 on what was then the corner of 
54th and Moneta. In its early days, the upstairs dance hall featured primarily 
jazz and big band music played by whites for a mostly white crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 As the racial makeup of the area shifted from white to black, more black 
artists performed at the club before black audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 10 blocks on Broadway -- the new name for Moneta -- numerous blues 
venues sprouted, including the defunct Dixie Club at 59th Street and Cotton 
Club at 50th. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 20s and early 30s, Thomas danced to live blues, jazz and R&B on a 
4,000-square-foot floor cluttered with hundreds of people from all over Los 
Angeles. Performers included Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton and B.B. King -- 
for a $1.25 cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the greats and anybody who was anybody was here," said Thomas, a Watts 
resident. "Ike and Tina (Turner) used to dance among us while they performed. 
On nights like those, you couldn't even move." 
</P>
<P>
 From the late 1940s to 1968, the ballroom hosted such legendary artists as Nat 
King Cole, Muddy Waters, Dina Washington and Otis Redding. They are portrayed 
in the enlarged stamps, which will hang atop the 5-4 building. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have to come before 10 or else you wouldn't be able to get in until 
midnight," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds even kept out the club's future owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always attempted to go upstairs, but I never could because there were too 
many people. It was almost impossible to drive through here because of the 
traffic," said Wilson, who had moved to the area in the mid-1950s from New 
Orleans, where he was exposed to the blues as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the club closed in the late '60s because of an economic decline in the 
area, Wilson danced at the ballroom only a handful of times. In 1980, he 
visited his brother's new garment-cutting business on Broadway. "As I walked 
around the building, my brother asked, 'Do you know where you are?' " Wilson 
recalled. "I didn't believe him when he said it was the 5-4 until he took me 
upstairs and showed me." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson saw the original red-vinyl booths where regulars crowded to watch the 
greats perform. The bandstand and a haunting aura of a bygone era were all that 
was left of the 5-4 Wilson knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sweeping view was unbelievable," Wilson said. "At that moment, I told my 
brother I wanted to buy the building." Less than a month later, the 5-4 was 
Wilson's for $400,000, which he paid out of his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 It took close to 15 years and an additional $850,000 in loans to bring the 
building up to health and safety codes and renovate the interior. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballroom will include a New Orleans-style restaurant, two bars, Venice 
chandeliers and a rooftop terrace. A high-tech sound system is being installed, 
and the original bandstand is being refurbished. The ballroom and supper club 
will accommodate 1,000 patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you listen closely you might be able to hear a friendly ghost," said 
Evans, pointing to the stage. "This is the real House of Blues," she said, 
referring to the popular new blues venue on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In May and July, Evans organized benefit concerts to raise funds for matinee 
music performances for children and for the 5-4 Optimist Club, an organization 
she founded to promote cultural awareness and lift the self-esteem of area 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the March reopening, Evans plans to have a few more fund-raisers, 
including a concert Dec. 16-18 featuring blues legend Charles Brown, who 
recently completed a tour with Bonnie Raitt. "Now there's going to be a place 
the youth can go," Thomas said. "This is what we did every weekend." ENRIQUE

<P>
 PNC Mortgage of Illinois, one of the largest mortgage lenders in the nation, 
has opened an office on Manchester Avenue to assist low- to moderate-income 
residents with the purchase of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 PNC offers two special programs: Starting Blocks, which guarantees mortgage 
loan approval to qualified applicants in four hours, and Triple Play, which is 
a 3% down payment mortgage package. 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening Oct. 27 at 1959 W. Manchester Ave., the mortgage company has 
already funded one loan and 10 applicants are in the pipeline, said Wanda 
Smith, branch manager and assistant vice president. Interest rates are 
competitive with conventional bank loans, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting Blocks is a common-sense approach to underwriting a loan," Smith 
said. "If a person can pay $1,000 in rent, then they can pay $1,000 in 
mortgage." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the mortgage company also looks at prospective borrowers' 
"alternative credit" history such as payment of utility bills or child-care 
obligations when evaluating their ability to pay. "We use any credit that 
doesn't show up on traditional credit reports to offset any negative credit," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Blocks customers will be able to shop for a home in the appropriate 
price range set by PNC Mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Triple Play, which will be available nationwide beginning Friday, is aimed at 
those who have difficulty saving money for a down payment. Under the program, 
down payment on a $100,000 home would be $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "PNC filled a void with opening a branch where there's a great need for 
financing low- and moderate-income buyers," said Wallace A. Dodson, president 
of the Consolidated Realty Board in Crenshaw. "With PNC's relaxed guidelines, 
it will allow more people to qualify." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodson said that in his dealings with banks in the area, a program like PNC's 
has not been tested, "but it should work." 
</P>
<P>
 Local community-based organizations as well as city officials are assisting 
PNC Mortgage by identifying borrowers who might be eligible for the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the office opened, "there have been at least 60 to 70 calls either 
directly to PNC, to Councilman (Mark) Ridley-Thomas' office or Supervisor 
(Yvonne) Brathwaite Burke's office," said Lou Collier, director of 
Inglewood-based Omniversed International, a consultant group acting as a 
community liaison for PNC.

 The topic under discussion was the deteriorating quality of a university 
education, but Jim, a student at UCLA, was calling to complain about something 
else. It was unfair, he said, that he was unable to get into UC Berkeley with a 
3.5 grade-point average when a Latino friend got in with a 3.0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what," Jim said. "I would have had a lot better chance if we 
didn't have these stupid quotas for these minorities who haven't done as well 
as I have in high school, who haven't put in the time and the guts. . . . It's 
a fact that they have affirmative-action advantages. It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 The co-hosts at KMPC-AM (710) weren't buying it. "You call it ridiculous," 
said Tavis Smiley, "but do you understand why institutions are mandated and 
challenged to enlist students of color at these campuses? Do you understand 
that at all?" 
</P>
<P>
 His colleague, Ruben Navarrette, jumped in: "One of the reasons it's important 
to do that, Jim, is because we're trying to produce leaders of the future. And 
if you've studied anything at UCLA about demographic changes, you know that 
there are now many more people in Los Angeles who are Latino, and if you're 
producing leadership for the next century, doesn't it make sense to try to 
produce a leadership class that looks like America?" 
</P>
<P>
 A typical talk-radio exchange? Not exactly. It was a serious discussion, it 
was a topic that pertained to young people, and the hosts were members of 
minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the radio talk show for Generation X.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea alone sounds like the premise for a "Saturday Night Live" sketch, one 
that might feature callers debating the merits of a Nine Inch Nails concert, 
analyzing the most recent episode of "Melrose Place" or discussing the optimum 
places to meet members of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ruben Navarrette, 27, and Tavis Smiley, who turned 30 in September, are 
catering to no one's stereotypes -- not about Generation X, not about 
minorities, not about talk radio. As the hosts of "Twentysomething Talk," heard 
on KMPC weeknights from 9 to midnight and Sundays 7-10 p.m., they are men with 
a mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to do three things that have never been done before: We're 
trying to bring in people of color, we're trying to bring in younger people, 
and we're trying to bring them into a thoughtful kind of medium," Smiley said. 
"I think we have the most difficult challenges facing us of any talk show in 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's right. Talk radio, in Southern California as throughout the country, is 
chiefly the province of middle-aged white hosts who cater to an older audience, 
increasingly by emphasizing entertainment and sensation over serious discussion 
of the major issues of the day. It's not that younger listeners are 
disregarded, but rather that they are thought to be more interested in spending 
their radio time with music stations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Capital Cities Communications already had a traditional talk station in 
venerable KABC-AM (790) when it bought KMPC last May. So the company decided to 
go after a different crowd. Smiley and Navarrette were a perfect pairing for 
what it had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be an interesting, novel thing to have a black and a 
Hispanic discussing all the issues -- not just generational issues, but what's 
going on in the community," said George Green, general manager of KABC and 
KMPC. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-pronged challenge is one that the young hosts are more than willing 
to tackle -- and for which they are more than qualified. No self-absorbed 
slackers they.  
</P>
<P>
 By 26, Navarrette had written a book chronicling his experiences as a Mexican 
American at Harvard. Within the next five to 10 years, he plans to run for 
Congress in the San Joaquin Valley, the area where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley, a former aide to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, was already running 
for office, on the Los Angeles City Council, when he was 26. He finished third 
in a field of 15. Since then, he has had several radio commentary jobs and 
still has a daily syndicated 60-second commentary, "The Smiley Report," on 
radio stations across the country. He also is considering another run for 
public office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get young people thinking and talking," Smiley says of their goal 
with the radio show. "I think too often we go through life in our younger 
stages not thinking that social or political issues are going to impact us. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're 22 or 28, you're not interested necessarily in this health-care 
debate -- until you realize you're going to be the ones paying for it. . . . We 
need to be concerned about that, and we need to be talking about it, for our 
own sake. And beyond that, we have older Americans eavesdropping on our 
conversations every night, maybe even participating. I think it's important 
that older Americans hear what we have to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the topics Smiley and Navarrette discuss are chosen for their obvious 
appeal to the program's target audience -- the morning-after birth control 
pill, the growing number of U.S. college graduates finding better jobs abroad 
than at home, or the alleged assault of a Latino youth by a black Compton 
police officer. Many others, however, are not much different from those of 
other shows, they just have a twentysomething slant -- such as young gays 
coming out of the closet, or why young people are apathetic about the 
gubernatorial campaign. The show also features a weekly profile of 
twentysomethings on the fast track and a Generation X trivia contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think their show is groundbreaking and different in this sense," said Al 
Brady Law, who, as KMPC operations manager, oversees the station's programming. 
"Whether or not it's traditional or on the cutting edge, it's the only talk 
show that I know of which is hosted by two people who are still basically in 
their 20s and are minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he hastens to add, "the mere fact that they're in their 20s and one 
happens to be African American and one happens to be Latino will not cut it in 
the long run. It still has to be an interesting and viable talk show." 
</P>
<P>
 A fter five months, the results on that count are mixed. The people who are 
listening like what they're hearing, for the most part -- but not many are 
listening. 
</P>
<P>
 "What appeals most to me about them is they attack issues that are pretty 
heated," said a 23-year-old certified public accountant who called to discuss 
Proposition 187, the ballot initiative that would make illegal immigrants 
ineligible for most state services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I listen because of the minority aspect, but mostly it's just the 
issues," said a 29-year-old black woman. "These guys deal with real-time, 
real-life issues. And I also like that they look for female and white 
perspectives too." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the most recent Arbitron ratings, "Twentysome-thing Talk" is 
attracting only 0.7% of the available audience -- an average of 6,567 listeners 
per quarter hour. KABC, by contrast, is drawing 4% of the 9 p.m.-midnight crowd 
-- 33,600 people per quarter hour -- with an issues show hosted by Larry Elder, 
and talk rival KFI-AM (640) is getting 2.6%, or 21,233 people, with Marilyn 
Kagan's therapy show. 
</P>
<P>
 KMPC management says its guys may need to lighten up some. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're both extraordinarily intelligent people who are, at times, a 
little bit too serious for my taste," Law said. "But the good news is they are 
so smart and they do their homework so well, they'll never go on the radio and 
embarrass me or embarrass themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley and Navarrette say they've been trying to temper their near-missionary 
zeal for things political by mixing in more lightweight topics, such as adult 
children who return home to live with their parents, whether schools should 
outlaw homework and determining the right time to get married. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics -- that's where our real passion is," Smiley says. "Ruben and I 
could play political baseball every night for three hours, but that doesn't 
work. We're trying to lighten the show, bring in generational topics, 
relationship issues. We have to convince young people that we're not going to 
talk over their heads or refuse to consider their concerns or be 
condescending." 
</P>
<P>
 A lthough both "Twenty-something Talk" hosts find themselves generally 
left-of-center on most issues, Smiley is the more liberal of the two. Recently, 
they were debating whether ethnic stereotypes in popular culture are dangerous 
or merely offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 A caller brought up Jesse, a young character who sells tacos on "Beverly 
Hills, 90210," charging that he reinforces negative stereotypes of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "This caller said, 'No wonder Latinos are in such a bad way: Look at the role 
models they have,' " Navarrette said. "Though I've said in the past that I find 
those images offensive and insulting, I don't think they're dangerous. I truly 
don't. My point is, 'Yes, we have Jesse, the taco man, but we also have Henry 
Cisneros.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley disagreed. Vehemently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely dangerous," he said. "Ask me the last time that I had some 
kid walk up to me on the street and say, 'Keep hope alive,' or, 'We, the 
people, can win,' or, 'Up with hope and down with dope' -- that Jesse Jackson 
stuff. Everybody wants to say Jesse Jackson is a black role model, but ask me 
the last time some kid walked up to me and recited a speech that Jesse Jackson 
had given. It hasn't happened. . . . I told Ruben, 'You're a great model for 
Latino kids, but let's be honest: How many young people are going to hear you 
tonight as opposed to young people who will see Jesse the taco man?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Navarrette countered: "You're underestimating the sophistication of my people 
if you think for one minute that we're taking our cues from Jesse the taco man. 
Think about this: 'Amos 'n' Andy' didn't result in a bunch of kids wanting to 
be Kingfish when they grew up." 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley and Navarrette were first thrown together last April. Navarrette, who 
had impressed KABC management as a guest on Michael Jackson's show discussing 
his book, "A Darker Side of Crimson: Odyssey of a Harvard Chicano," was asked 
to fill in for vacationing Dennis Prager. Smiley, already a regular commentator 
on the station's early-morning "The Ken and Barkley Company," was in the 
building to pick up his mail when, on the spur of the moment, station officials 
sent him in to co-host. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley, who recently compiled many of his commentaries into a book, "Just a 
Thought: The Smiley Report," is the faster talker of the two and is perceived 
by his bosses as the more impatient, rabidly eager to get to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tavis wants to get ahead very quickly," general manager Green said. "He's 
ready to be Michael Jackson. He wants it now." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear that a lot," Smiley said. "Yes, I'm impatient, but I don't think I 
have to be patient. I have to be good. I don't see why you have to wait till 
you're 50 years old to be a success." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he admits he's tackling talk radio in order to have his voice, as a 
liberal African American -- or a "practical progressive," as he likes to 
describe himself -- heard on a massive scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics was and still is my first love," he said. "But one thing I've 
learned as I've gotten older is that there's more than one way to impact the 
political process than simply being an elected official. I have discovered, 
through being on the radio and being a commentator and author, that one can 
arguably be more effective on the outside than you can be as an elected 
official on the inside." 
</P>
<P>
 S miley grew up near Indianapo lis and graduated from Indiana University. He 
hit on the idea of doing radio commentaries while running for the 6th Los 
Angeles City Council District in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 "While I was campaigning," he said, "I talked to very few African American 
reporters, and it occurred to me that, despite the massive nature of the 
market, there was no person of color doing political commentaries on a daily 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 So, after the election, he decided to attempt it. "I reasoned that if I 
started a commentary talking about the issues of the day, No. 1, people would 
know who I was, and No. 2, there would be somebody in our community talking 
about the real hard issues," Smiley said. "And we'd all benefit from that." 
</P>
<P>
 He decided that if he wanted to reach African Americans, he should do it by 
broadcasting on black-oriented stations. After starting out at KGFJ-AM, Smiley 
was approached by Stevie Wonder, who owns KJLH-FM. Then, KKBT -- an even more 
popular station -- beckoned. From there, KABC called, and he wound up working 
for both its radio and television outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't seek any of it out, which shows that that voice is missing," Smiley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he has grown more influential in the black community, 
counting among his friends Rosa Parks and Maya Angelou, with whom he took a 
trip recently to Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Smiley's high energy and in-your-face charm, Navarrette has a 
more wry manner, one that belies his intensity and a burning ambition. As does 
Smiley, he feels strongly about having his voice heard, and he wants to add to 
the small number of Latinos in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be that voice, then go into politics from there," Navarrette 
declared. "I want to get Latinos energized and voting. Then, in a very sly way, 
after I've done that, throw myself up as a candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 It was shortly after graduating from college in 1990 that he wrote the book 
about his experiences as a Mexican American at an Ivy League school. The Fresno 
Bee called it "probably the most important book to come out of the San Joaquin 
Valley in half a century -- since Steinbeck and Saroyan." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its publication last year, Navarrette has also written columns for the 
Fresno Bee and op-ed pieces for the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Navarrette's lens has been fixed on members of his generation, 
whom he describes in his book as "so numerous and so troubled" with urgent 
matters to be attended to. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley and Navarrette were not hired because of their political aspirations, 
nor even in spite of them, but KMPC managers say that they don't mind their 
station being used as a jumping-off point for future political careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's perfectly acceptable for people to have agendas aside from radio 
careers," operations manager Law said. "For them to use the radio station as a 
springboard is fine as long as they're helping the radio station while they're 
using it. And, in my view, they are. It's kind of like, 'If you scratch my 
back, I'll scratch yours.' " 
</P>
<P>
 W hen it comes to explaining their ambitious agendas, both men are quick to 
credit their close-knit families for the drive and the early success that has 
defined them and given them the sense that anything is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarrette is one of three children. Smiley is one of 10 -- and the oldest of 
eight sons. He has helped five siblings through college. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarrette and Smiley have many of the same practical concerns as their 
Generation X counterparts. Both bachelors, only recently have they found 
secure, well-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we talk about being young and not able to afford health care, that's not 
some pie-in-the sky notion," Smiley said. "Ruben and I were both without health 
insurance coverage prior to signing our contracts with Capital Cities. I was 
brushing my teeth eight times a day, running five miles a day and trying to eat 
right because I couldn't afford to go to the doctor's office for a checkup. 
Neither of us owns a home; we're both renters. So when we talk about health 
care and financial difficulties and wanting to own a home and get married, 
we're right in the crux of all the issues we're talking about. It's not like 
we're the minister and they're the parishioners. We're all in the same boat." 
</P>
<P>
 For all their typicalness, however, neither relishes being appointed a 
spokesman for a generation, and both try hard not to sound that way on 
"Twentysomething Talk." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are expected to be spokespersons, but we try not to be," Smiley said. "We 
try to be facilitators and moderators, allowing those people who are older to 
hear what our generation has to say." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the truisms is that young people don't like people presuming to speak 
for them," Navarrette said. "They don't want you or I trying to be their 
spokesperson. If we want our generation to talk back, then we have to do more 
listening, less preaching. Ideally the show doesn't belong to the two of us, 
the show belongs to twentysomethings. And I want to do everything I can to put 
it in their hands."*

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: SILVER LAKE; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER PLAN FOR DOG PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRETT MAHONEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget about killer bees, four-legged furry creatures may soon be legally 
unleashed in the Silver Lake recreation area.  
</P>
<P>
 The Recreation and Parks Commission unanimously approved City Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg's plan to turn Silver Lake's Dog Hill into an official dog park 
at its Oct. 19 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which sets aside specific hours when dogs will be allowed to 
roam unleashed, will be inspected by the City Council in the next few weeks, 
but Goldberg does not foresee any obstacles in getting the one-year pilot 
program approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Dog Hill has been the meeting place for the four-legged set for years. In 
June, however, owners began receiving tickets from Animal Regulation for 
letting their pets run free and they appealed to Goldberg to make it an 
official dog park. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to Steven Soboroff, chief of the Recreation and Parks 
Commission, Goldberg stated that residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of 
creating a dog park and presented her with a petition with more than 1,200 
signatures in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said the dog park would allow residents to feel a sense of community 
that is usually associated with smaller towns. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the dogs are out running around together, the adults get a chance to 
socialize," she said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has, however, received a few catcalls. Some neighbors of the park 
have threatened to file suit against the city because they contend allowing 
unleashed dogs to run free through the park could be a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 To appease the critics, a fence is being erected in the park to isolate Dog 
Hill from the children's sandlot, basketball court and west side of the 
recreation area. No dogs, leashed or unleashed, will be allowed in picnic 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also limits the times that dogs may be unleashed on Dog Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said she has consulted the city attorney about the proposal and is 
certain it can withstand any legal challenge. She pointed to Dog Hill's 
problem-free history as evidence that the proposal can work. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal Regulation has received only one complaint about Dog Hill during the 
past year, said Lt. Marshall Vernon. That incident involved one unleashed dog 
attacking another canine. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Dog Hill proposal is adopted by the City Council, the Silver Lake 
recreation area will join two other such parks in Los Angeles  
</P>
<P>
 County where leash laws are exempt. The others are in Studio City and in Long 
Beach. No major problems have been reported in either place, officials said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; POLICE SUBSTATION SITE GETS A BLESSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tossing salt grains at the entrance and bowing before an altar, the reverend 
blessed the rundown building that will be refurbished for Little Tokyo's first 
police substation. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony was part of last Wednesday's groundbreaking for the long-awaited 
koban , as a roadside police booth is commonly known in Japan. The celebration 
of the substation, which community members have lobbied for since 1990, 
attracted a host of dignitaries and hopes for a safer Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will set a tone on the streets that Little Tokyo is not a place to commit 
petty crimes," said Los Angeles Police Capt. Richard Bonneau. 
</P>
<P>
 The substation, at 1st and San Pedro streets, will be open daily from 10 a.m. 
to 11 p.m., link Little Tokyo more closely to the Police Department and 
hopefully revive tourism, said Howard Nishimura of the Greater Little Tokyo 
Anti-Crime Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want Japanese tourists to stay in Little Tokyo when they visit. Now they 
are staying near Disneyland or in Santa Monica and other outlying areas because 
they think downtown is unsafe," Nishimura said. "We hope the koban will bring 
them here and help them feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The substation also will serve as an information center with full-time 
Japanese-speaking staff members assisting police with crime reports, providing 
translation and referrals to local social services. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47 volunteers who patrol Little Tokyo will move out of Mitsuru Grill 
restaurant at 360 E. 1st Street, their current base, and work out of the 
substation by next February, organizers hope. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a rash of car break-ins, burglaries and graffiti prompted the 
formation of the anti-crime association and the safety patrol program. Since 
then, Nishimura said, crime in Little Tokyo has decreased by 25%. Volunteers 
worked with police officers to set up surveillance in high-crime areas, 
resulting in seven arrests and convictions for car burglaries, the association 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "The koban is a tremendous example of community-based policing," said state 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. "It's an invitation for law enforcement to be a 
permanent presence in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonneau added: "The safety patrols have really been our eyes and ears. This 
koban will allow us to be more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanizawa Masami, president of Matsuzakaya department store in Little Tokyo, 
said when Japanese people hear the word koban , they think of safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very popular in Japan," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 There are roughly 1,000 kobans in Tokyo, where Japan police officers are 
stationed around the clock to patrol the streets, control traffic and make 
house calls. Nishimura added that Japanese kobans are typical social centers 
where locals bring food to the police or gather for community meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we have the police station right here, near Little Tokyo, no one 
ever goes there," he said. "With the koban we can open communication lines and 
build a sense of camaraderie."

BEYOND BLOOD AND YUCKS; NBC'S FAST-PACED NEW MEDICAL DRAMA 'ER' OWES MORE TO 
'COPS' AND 'RESCUE 911' THAN TO 'DR. KILDARE' AND 'MARCUS WELBY, M.D.' -- WHICH 
IS JUST FINE WITH '90S VIEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rick Du Brow, Rick Du Brow is The Times' television writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an eye-catching set for a TV show, a large and compelling maze of 
hospital rooms that takes up most of Stage 11 at Warner Bros. studios in 
Burbank. There, at the moment, a sprawling, surprising major new hit -- the 
medical series "ER" -- is being crafted. The initials stand for emergency room 
, and the NBC drama's trademark is a frenetic pace as blurry swarms of people 
and stories crisscross in a program that took off like a shot in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, during a break on a recent sunny morning, most of the heretofore 
low-profile principals in the cast -- who play the medical staff -- are sitting 
on brand-new bicycles with Christmas decorations, a gift from one of their 
colleagues, actor George Clooney, who portrays a cool, loose, womanizing 
pediatrician. Examining their bikes, they name him Santa Clooney. 
</P>
<P>
 Clooney, son of former KNBC-TV Channel 4 anchor Nick Clooney, sums up the tone 
of the Angst -ridden, emotion-churning yet often funny one-hour series as well 
as anybody: "In a line, it's Rome burns." He adds: "When you have so many 
things flying around, it's not like a standard TV show where you sit down and 
there's two people talking at a table for four pages." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, says NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield, "our viewers, in 
network research groups, consistently describe this as an action show" -- 
certainly a new twist on that old staple of television drama, the medical 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 The furious pace of the "ER" format has already taken its toll, clobbering 
another new medical series that took a more traditional approach in its style, 
CBS' "Chicago Hope," when they went head to head at season's start. CBS moved 
"Chicago Hope" to another time slot. 
</P>
<P>
 "ER," which ranked among TV's top four shows in its first month on the air, 
also clobbered ABC's high-profile newsmagazine "PrimeTime Live" and its 
$7-million anchor star, Diane Sawyer. ABC is moving "PrimeTime Live" to a new 
time slot in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been this jazzed about anything I've been involved with on 
television since 'Columbo,' " says Steven Spielberg, whose company co-produces 
"ER" with the author and creator of the series, Michael Crichton, and Warner 
Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Columbo," starring Peter Falk, became a regular series in 1971, 
Spielberg directed the first episode and Steven Bochco wrote the script. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a stake in television," Spielberg says. " 'ER' is the first time we've 
had a hit, in the early stages." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a big event for NBC too, and viewers must have been stunned when the 
network preempted "ER" on Oct. 27 to showcase another new drama, "Sweet 
Justice," risking the growing word of mouth the medical series had generated. 
Right or wrong, NBC already is convinced that it has a long-term smash.

 Thus far, at least, "ER" has been turning TV upside down on several important 
levels, despite criticism from some quarters that it does not accurately depict 
the practice of emergency medicine physicians in the 1990s. The series is based 
on Crichton's experiences as a medical student at Massachusetts General 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'ER' illustrates the practice of emergency medicine from 20 years ago, not 
the unique medical specialty that it is today," Dr. John B. McCabe, president 
of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said in response to the pilot 
of the series, which is set in a Chicago teaching hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, to the surprise even of NBC, which initially was skeptical of the 
show's chances, "ER" has clearly touched a nerve with audiences. The most 
obvious connection may be the national concern and debate over health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in an era where people are concerned about being taken care of," says 
Leslie Moonves, president of Warner Bros. Television. 
</P>
<P>
 "ER," in short, may well be an idea that was simply ripe, because, as Crichton 
acknowledges, the project was rejected through the years in various quarters -- 
partly, he says, because of its "larger dose of reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps just as important to the appeal of "ER" -- the show is guided daily by 
former "China Beach" producer John Wells -- is the sheer power of the 
fast-paced style, which, building on Crichton's memories, was refined in the 
slam-bang premiere by director Rod Holcomb. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from a Steadicam -- a body-mounted camera that allows lengthy, 
gliding shots -- and consistent lighting aided by low fluorescent ceilings that 
simulate hospital rooms, the action often moves in a steady, seemingly nonstop 
flow. And the human flow frequently rings true, with bits and pieces of stories 
interlocking, as real life does in close quarters where hectic events overlap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's great about this show is that it's like watching a bad freeway 
design," Spielberg says. "All of the roads intersect at the critical point in 
the epicenter, and you sit back and watch the pileup, and then you wonder: Is 
there going to be any continuity to this chaos? It does all have meaning, and 
it does sort itself out. And by the end of the episodes, you see that the 
characters are having relationships with each other, they have lives away from 
the ER, and the series is going in a slow but positive direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The pace, by accident or design, also serves another purpose for NBC: At a 
time when networks are concerned about channel surfing by impatient viewers -- 
which has resulted in the elimination of some theme songs and commercials so 
that one series can go directly into another -- "ER" is a formidable weapon in 
holding viewer attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always moving," says the show's director of photography, Richard Thorpe. 
"I think that this is a new kind of show. The pace is what makes this show run. 
Before a viewer can get bored and surf to another channel, we're changing -- 
going to the next drama or the next little moment. In the '90s, people's 
attention spans are so short, but this show's grabbing you all the time. We're 
never dwelling on any one thing. We're off on something else." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the ultimate irony: TV's reality and newsmagazine shows, 
which have displaced many drama series and now are feeling the lash-back of 
"ER," may well have contributed to the style that is making the medical show a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We owe a real debt to the reality shows of the '80s," says co-executive 
producer Wells, "because the dramatic artifice, the theatricality of cop and 
medical shows in the past, gave way to great expectations of realism on the 
audience's part. When 'Rescue 911' and 'Cops' are on, I don't think you can go 
back and do the cop and medical shows you did 15 years ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "But the difficulty that all the reality shows have is that you can't 
artificially manipulate the dramatic tension. You have to follow the incident 
as it happens, and sometimes things don't happen and you can't do anything. But 
in '90s dramas, you get the sense of pace, and writers can manipulate and make 
it more rewarding and give you more." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lance Gentile, technical adviser and writer for "ER," says that because of 
reality shows, "You can't do 'Marcus Welby' anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Warner Bros.' Moonves: "What 'NYPD Blue' and 'ER' have done is 
re-establish drama as a great place for the networks to go. Dramas are beating 
the hell out of the newsmagazines. I think a year from now we'll see fewer 
newsmagazines on the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Crichton, who is working with Spielberg on their sequel to "Jurassic Park," 
thinks that with or without reality shows, network television painted itself 
into a corner through the years: "It slipped further and further into its own 
sense of a kind of established television reality that appears on all of the 
networks. They drifted too far away from any reality that I recognize." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg says that "ER" has "a style that has been very successful in ve rite 
television. In 'Cops' and even in some of the often awkwardly constructed 
(shows) of re-creations of actual emergencies, there have been a couple of 
years of what I like to just call emergency television." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds: "It's a Catch-22 in a very good way. What laid the groundwork for 
'ER' stylistically was actuality television, and now perhaps 'ER' will cancel 
out not all the actuality television but some of the actuality television where 
the re-creations aren't as realistic as they could be." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells just plain admits that he's "absolutely" surprised at the way "ER" took 
off: "I expected that 'PrimeTime Live' would win the hour and that 'ER' and 
'Chicago Hope' would be duking it out for second place. Everyone predicted 
that. The network was, I believe, guaranteeing (advertisers) a 23 share." 
</P>
<P>
 That's 23% of the audience. But in its first month, "ER" averaged a whopping 
31%, right up there with "Home Improvement," "Grace Under Fire" and "Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody expected it," Wells says. 
</P>
<P>
 O n this particular day on Stage 11, they're shooting an epi sode scheduled to 
air Dec. 8 in the 10 p.m. Thursday time slot "ER" has inherited from two other 
breakthrough dramas also launched by NBC -- "Hill Street Blues" and "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
 Like those shows, "ER" has an ensemble cast, and the six principal stars are 
all there for the shoot -- faces that are swiftly becoming more recognizable as 
they emerge from the swarm of extras, who average about 35 a day, says second 
assistant director Michael Pendell. 
</P>
<P>
 ("I use some real nurses with the actors," says adviser-writer Gentile, who 
has practiced emergency medicine for 18 years, "and that raises the level of 
reality because they know how to work the equipment and how to move and push 
their way in between the doctor-actors and do their stuff.") 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to 'ER,' you wouldn't call it a superstar cast," says NBC's 
Littlefield. "However, today they all are." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not quite yet, but they're on their way. Besides Clooney, 33, the 
medical staff includes Anthony Edwards as the soft-spoken chief resident who is 
clearly the anchor of the on-screen proceedings; Sherry Stringfield as a 
no-nonsense physician; Eriq LaSalle as a confident surgical resident; Noah Wyle 
as a wide-eyed, good-hearted medical student who is sometimes in over his head, 
and Julianna Margulies as the head nurse coming back after a suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing his green medical scrubs, Edwards, 32, is a very real-looking, 
unglamorous yet confident presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason for your chief resident to be as good-looking as George 
Hamilton," he cracks. "The whole point is to get people to relate to the 
characters." 
</P>
<P>
 Stringfield, 27, has quickly moved from one of television's top shows to 
another. Last season, she played an assistant district attorney and ex-wife of 
David Caruso on another breakout drama, ABC's "NYPD Blue." Why would she leave? 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't working hard," she says. "I was a regular, and I wasn't very regular 
on the show. They ("ER") called my agent and sent the script. I knew the show 
would take off. The writing from the beginning was great." 
</P>
<P>
 LaSalle is convinced that "the style of the show makes it very accessible." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not long and drawn out," the 32-year-old actor says. "The most important 
thing is that I think the audience feels they go on the journey with us. So 
it's more interactive. We take the audience on a ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Gentile puts it: "If you don't like the story or actor now, there'll be 
another one in a minute. It's more like life. Things happen. You don't always 
have an ending. You come in the middle of people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a puzzle that's very orchestrated," says the director of the episode, 
Mimi Leder, another "China Beach" veteran, who is also a supervising producer 
of the series. With the essentially "pre-lit" sets and the Steadicam, "we're on 
a continuous motion," she adds. "I often weave scenes. If I can have one person 
take me to another scene, I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the tone, says Margulies, 26, is that she has no idea where her 
character is going in the series: "I think it's great because it keeps it 
spontaneous." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wyle, at 23, is a reminder of the teaching aspect of the hospital: 
"I've got a lot of letters from medical students who say their experience is 
like the one I'm having on the show, or comparable." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Gentile, a droll veteran whose behind-the-scenes role is one of 
those only-in-Hollywood stories. As a practitioner of emergency medicine, with 
current part-time duties at Lakewood Regional Medical Center and Century City 
Hospital, he is a link for "ER" with doctors who criticize the show. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the 45-year-old Gentile, as a scriptwriter, technical 
adviser and graduate of the USC School of Cinema and Television, is involved 
with the series' creative side, including the cast. For instance, he says, he 
gives audiotapes of medical terms to the performers along with their scripts so 
they can become more proficient at rattling off the hospital language. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're getting better at it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 T he making of the "ER" televi sion series is yet another prof itable product 
involving the longtime acquaintance of Spielberg and Crichton. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first signed my seven-year contract with Universal, when I was 20 
years old," Spielberg says, "my first assignment was to escort this tall young 
man (Crichton) and give him a tour of Universal Studios because he'd just sold 
the novel 'The Andromeda Strain' to (director) Robert Wise and Universal." 
</P>
<P>
 The book was published in 1969, the film came out in 1971, and "we have stayed 
in touch all these years," Spielberg says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, he says, "Michael brought me the script . . . called 'ER.' I 
loved what I thought the script could be as a feature film. I bought it from 
Michael directly, and I began to develop it with Michael for me as a director. 
We had worked on it a number of days. . . . We were discussing revisions, and 
in the middle of one of the meetings, I just sort of casually asked Michael 
what else he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Crichton, says Spielberg, told him that he was working up a story about 
dinosaurs: "I got him to open up and tell me the whole bloody story. And by the 
end of the couple of hours, we hadn't discussed 'ER' at all -- we had only 
discussed 'Jurassic Park.' I was just so in love with this story of his that we 
agreed on a handshake that if I would physically direct the movie, he would 
give me the rights to the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so I immediately became completely tuned in to 'Jurassic Park,' and 'ER' 
went on the shelf. 'ER' sat around my company for a number of years because I 
owned it. Then one day, Tony Thomopoulos (president of Spielberg's Amblin 
Television division) called me and he said, 'I've just read this script -- 
which is in the inactive file -- called "ER," by Michael Crichton. I think it 
would make a great pilot.' And I said, 'Really?' He said, 'Yeah. Can I run with 
it?' And I said, 'Absolutely.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While Crichton and Spielberg have full plates, they keep a careful eye on 
"ER." Says Crichton: "With each succeeding episode, I have found that I have 
less to say. I subscribe to the medical belief that there is nothing better 
than no symptoms." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg says he looks at the dailies "on videotape every day" and sends 
notes on the story outlines, treatments and scripts: "I'm focused on my new 
company (with partners Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen) and on my life, but 
I so enjoy 'ER,' I got in the habit of just getting involved." He emphasizes, 
however, that "John Wells is responsible to the series and is doing a brilliant 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Wells: "We've hit some kind of chord that people are responding to." 
</P>
<P>
 Response also continues from real-life emergency medicine physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 3, Dr. Gerald Whelan, an associate professor at the USC School of 
Medicine and secretary-treasurer of the American Board of Emergency Medicine, 
charged in a Counterpunch article in The Times that the premiere of "ER" 
presented an outdated, "dangerous, erroneous" picture of emergency medical care 
that offered "neither hide nor hair of a single attending physician." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked recently if he thought that "ER" had changed since the premiere, Whelan 
said: "I think it's improved a little bit in that the actual medical treatments 
are technically reasonable for a dramatic series. But what's still missing is 
the presence of any attending physicians. I've been in contact with Dr. 
Gentile, and they indicated that they intended to bring in more attending 
physicians but wanted to develop the characters first." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Marshall T. Morgan, director of emergency medicine at the UCLA Medical 
Center, thinks that "ER" is "a pretty good show" despite some unrealistic 
situations that result from compression of dramatic material. But he believes 
that Whelan's criticism was "accurate," especially in regard to "unsupervised 
resident physicians -- you'd never guess there is a bona fide specialty of 
emergency medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Dr. Toni Mitchell, who practices at an urban hospital in Tampa, Fla., and 
is a spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians: "They have 
made a tremendous number of improvements from a technical standpoint. They're 
very reflective of the kinds of patients I have in terms of story lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'd like (the show) to say a little more strongly that these are 
specialists in emergency medicine and that they won't be something else when 
they grow up, and this is something we do every day, by choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Responds Wells: "Every emergency room is not alike. We haven't done a single 
thing that hasn't come out of research. The biggest criticism that I think is 
justified is that there aren't enough attending physicians. But as the show 
continues, you will see more attending doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile says the criticism comes from concern that, without attending 
physicians, "people will be afraid to go to emergency rooms, thinking they're 
going to get doctors in training." He believes, however, that there is a 
positive message in the presentation of doctors as heroic and caring. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted before the most recent episode, Dr. Robert Karns, president of the 
Los Angeles County Medical Assn., said: "I haven't seen the show, but the 
patients say it's great." 
</P>
<P>
 O n the set of "ER," director Leder is coolly moving through one scene after 
another. Two takes. Three takes. Two takes. "Cut. Print. Excellent." 
</P>
<P>
 During a break, Clooney casually strolls through the set singing, paraphrasing 
the lyrics to a pop song: "I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps." 
</P>
<P>
 He's found the right place.*

<P>
 When three liquor and convenience stores near Hoover Street School were 
destroyed in the 1992 riots, some parents hoped they would never come back. 
They had long considered the stores a nuisance, and felt they attracted drunken 
panhandlers whom they say often harassed their children for money as they 
walked to and from the elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the stores rebuilt, the parents and teachers of the Hoover Street 
School Parent Center, a group dedicated to providing English and parenting 
classes to the community, took it on themselves to work with the liquor store 
owners to ensure the children's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year's worth of efforts later, both the parents and the owners of 
the store nearest the school -- a 7-Eleven at 9th and Westmoreland -- are 
pleased with the results of their cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 7-Eleven reopened in June, 1993, the parents' group approached its 
owners, Myung-Jah and Ernest Lee, with a few suggestions they felt could help 
discourage loitering during school foot-traffic hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were worried about the safety and well-being of our children," said Hilda 
Escalante, who has a son in the fourth grade. "We didn't want them to see 
drunks hanging around on the street. It's a bad influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Their suggestions included not selling small sizes of wine, single containers 
of beer and single cigarettes between 6 and 8:30 a.m., and between 2 and 3:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had already imposed certain operating conditions on the store, 
including a ban on pornographic materials, graffiti removal within 48 hours, a 
well-lit parking lot, no-loitering signs and security, but the parents' 
suggestions were geared toward making the premises less inviting to 
panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you sell small quantities, it encourages people to loiter and ask for 
money," said Isabel Vasquez, a former Hoover Street teacher who helped organize 
the parents' group. "It's easier to hang around and gather 20 cents to buy a 
single cigarette than it is to gather enough for a whole pack." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lees agreed to try out the voluntary conditions suggested by the parents. 
Although Myung-Jah Lee still sees loiterers in her parking lot, she feels the 
situation has become less severe during the time the store curbs its 
single-serving sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "They still hang around, but during those hours, we don't see them much," she 
said. "Now they hide, and come back later." 
</P>
<P>
 To maintain good relations, the parents began inviting the Lees, as well as a 
representative from the Southland Corp., which owns the 7-Eleven chain, to 
their monthly meetings last fall. These meetings soon attracted representatives 
from the Department of Alcohol and Beverage Control, city officials, Los 
Angeles Police Department officers and several other local liquor store owners, 
whom the group is now trying to convince to adopt the same voluntary 
school-hour conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some complain that they are mom-and-pop stores, and can't afford to lose 
sales," Vasquez said. "But the kids have to walk through this every day, and 
that's an issue to consider." 
</P>
<P>
 By working together, the Lees and the Hoover Street School Parent Center have 
tackled another problem -- graffiti on the side of the store. Trying to abide 
by the city's graffiti-removal order, the Lees found themselves painting their 
Westmoreland Avenue-facing wall almost daily, until a local loiterer suggested 
that perhaps painting a religious symbol on the wall might help discourage 
taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lees brought this suggestion to a meeting, and the parents toyed with it 
for a while. Although they ruled against the idea of religious symbolism, a 
mural was decided upon.  
</P>
<P>
 The Southland Corp. donated paint, and Cynthia Vargas, a 23-year-old art 
student working as a teacher's aide at Hoover Street, volunteered her talent. 
While she worked on the mural this summer, she also recruited the help of 
several local youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is an educationally themed mural titled "Lecciones del Pasado" 
(Lessons From the Past), unveiled last month. LESLIE BERESTEIN

 A memorial service last weekend for Philip Vera Cruz, the veteran Filipino 
labor leader who died June 10 at the age of 89, was both a final farewell to 
the pioneer activist and the beginning of an effort to help young activists 
continue in his footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony, at Local 11 of the Hotel and Restaurant Worker's Union at 321 S. 
Bixel St., marked the launching of the Philip Vera Cruz Memorial Fund, 
established by friends of Vera Cruz from labor and education groups and the 
Filipino American and other Asian American communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Administered under the auspices of UCLA's Asian American Studies Center, the 
fund will support research and projects involving Filipino American history and 
Asian American labor studies, and will provide scholarship funds for Asian 
American college students involved in labor and community activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the major challenges for us who have been touched and inspired by 
Philip is the challenge of continuing his life's work," said Enrique de la 
Cruz, assistant director of the center.  
</P>
<P>
 Vera Cruz, a pioneer in the struggle for farm workers' rights, was a migrant 
worker who came to the United States in 1926 at the age of 22 in hopes of a 
better life but found himself exploited as cheap labor. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the manong -- single male Filipino immigrants who were prevented 
from bringing dependent relatives -- Vera Cruz toiled in the grape fields of 
Central California, living in work camps with other migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in September, 1965, he heard news of Filipino farm workers striking for 
better wages a few miles from where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
 The event marked the beginning of the farm workers' movement, and Vera Cruz 
dedicated himself to the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, the mostly Filipino Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee merged 
with the largely Mexican National Farm Workers' Assn. to become the United Farm 
Workers, and Vera Cruz eventually became the union's vice president and 
highest-ranking Filipino official. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he dropped out of the union in 1977 in protest of Cesar Chavez's 
visit to the Philippines under the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, Vera Cruz 
continued his activism, often lecturing on college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bong Vergara, a 21-year-old Filipino American UCLA student, first met Vera 
Cruz during a summer leadership conference for Asian American students. 
</P>
<P>
 As a student activist, Vergara considers Vera Cruz a role model. 
</P>
<P>
 " Manong Philip was someone who stuck to his principles, and student activists 
need this reassurance," he said. "I don't think he would want us to think of 
him as a loss. He's a source of inspiration. He represents possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from Vera Cruz's 1992 memoir, "Philip Vera Cruz; A Personal History 
of Filipino Immigrants and the Farm Workers' Movement," will go toward the 
memorial fund.  
</P>
<P>
 Compiled from interviews with the activist by Berkeley-based writers Craig 
Scharlin and Lilia Villanueva and published through UCLA, the book -- now in 
its second printing -- is part of the university's Asian American Studies 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 According to De La Cruz, other fund-raising activities are planned for the 
future, and private donations are welcome. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; CITY MANAGER TAKES POST IN HAWTHORNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd W. Argow, South Gate's city manager for four years, announced last week 
that he is resigning to become city manager of Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 Argow will assume his new post on Nov. 28. He said he will continue to conduct 
South Gate's business matters "right up until midnight" of his last day on the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think I'm leaving South Gate in good shape," Argow said. "During my 
time here, the climate for businesses has greatly improved and the city has 
become a safer place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Argow, 42, said his two greatest accomplishments were developing an emergency 
preparedness program that helped keep the city virtually untouched during the 
1992 riots and the high ranking that South Gate recently received from 
Cognetics Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., economic research firm, as an attractive 
environment for entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the riots, the fires burned to our borders on three out of four sides. 
We remained safe and our businesses remained safe," Argow said. "When 
businesses look for places to go, they notice things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Argow also noted that the city's financial shape has improved. When he arrived 
in South Gate, the city was running a deficit of $200,000. The city now has a 
$4-million reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Argow said he made the decision to leave because Hawthorne offered him a 
higher salary and new responsibilities. Hawthorne's outgoing city manager, Jim 
Mitsch, earned $120,000. Argow would not disclose his salary or how much more 
he will be earning at his new job. 
</P>
<P>
 Before arriving in South Gate, Argow worked for six years as the public 
services director for Saratoga in Santa Clara County, as assistant to the city 
manager, intergovernmental relations administrator and grants administrator for 
Oceanside for seven years, and as an administrative analyst for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned a master's degree in public administration from San Diego State 
University in 1978 after earning his bachelor's degree in public administration 
from California Baptist College, Riverside in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate's City Council has not yet begun interviewing candidates to serve 
as interim or permanent city manager. Argow said he will submit a list of 
individuals to fill the post. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; 'NICE, CLEAN WALLS' ARE HIS REWARD

<P>
 In the advance guard of South Gate's 3-year-old war on graffiti, you'll find 
veteran "hydroblaster" and paint expert George Alcantar. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the city's orange-shirted Parks and Recreation anti-graffiti 
squad, Alcantar spends 10 hours a day, four days a week scrubbing tagger 
signatures and indecipherable scribbles off walls and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really rewarding work, especially when you drive past a nice, clean 
wall," Alcantar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people take it for granted that South Gate has some of the cleanest 
walls around, but we don't. We get out there and fight what taggers and 
gangbangers leave behind all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 Alcantar and about 30 other South Gate residents, business owners and city 
employees were honored Tuesday at the South Gate Park Banquet Room for their 
participation in what is affectionately known as the city's WOG, or War on 
Graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the fighting is quite literal, said Alcantar, such as the time he 
and a partner spotted a dozen gang members spraying an MTA bus with tags -- the 
arcane, individual signatures left by thousands of city youths almost anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 After Alcantar confronted the youths, they turned on him and surrounded the 
city pickup truck he and his partner were in. 
</P>
<P>
 "They circled around us and started shaking the truck," said Alcantar, now 
laughing off the incident as just another facet of his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcantar called police for help and six of the taggers were arrested, leaving 
Alcantar with a war story and the duty of clearing the bus of the signatures 
left behind. He said the most common methods of ridding surfaces of graffiti 
are "hydroblasting" -- which involves shooting a high-density spray of water 
and sand -- and simple paint removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in 1991 at the urging of city residents shocked by an upsurge in 
graffiti activity, WOG emphasizes cooperation between the community and city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we started the WOG, there wasn't a building on Tweedy Boulevard that 
wasn't full of tags," said Police Chief Ron George in a speech detailing the 
history of the anti-graffiti program. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual residents and business owners are urged to "adopt a block" of 
property and either rid it of graffiti themselves or donate money and materials 
to the city so employees like Alcantar can take care of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were doing research for what kind of program South Gate needed, we 
found that in most places the total responsibility for graffiti removal was 
placed on the city," George said. "What was lacking and what we needed was the 
element of personal responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with $250,000 of city money being used to combat graffiti, combined with 
the efforts of individuals and business owners, city residents say South Gate 
has some of the cleanest walls in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Graffiti used to be our biggest problem," said Ana Pena, who manages a 
13-unit apartment complex. "But this program has cleaned things up a lot, made 
it a lot easier for us to keep our property looking attractive. Now we worry 
more about tenants who just don't pay their rent." SIMON ROMERO

HEARING SET IN PROSTITUTION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pretrial hearing for a Little Tokyo businessman accused of running a 
prostitution ring last year is set for Nov. 16 in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshifumi Koike, charged with two felony counts of pandering and one count of 
pimping, faces up to eight years in prison if found guilty, said Deputy 
District Atty. James Dabney. Koike pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Koike, 34, a Japanese citizen who lives in Monterey Park and holds a resident 
visa, was arrested in October 1993. He is free on $25,000 bail.  
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said that while Koike was operating a legitimate graphic design 
firm, Zero Graphics, he also allegedly ran an escort service that catered to 
Japanese businessmen.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: REGION; FRIENDS SEEK CLUES IN RETIREE'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an urban tragedy repeated too often in news stories: A longtime resident 
who invests time and concern in the community becomes a victim of the very 
violence he or she deplored. 
</P>
<P>
 But friends and family of Neile Adams, who suffered a fatal heart attack when 
thieves broke into his home in September, are determined that the 75-year-old 
retiree's death will not end up just another unsolved crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week a group of about 30 set out from the Police Department's Southwest 
Division station on King Boulevard to distribute flyers advertising a $25,000 
reward for information leading to the prosecution of those responsible for 
Adams' death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need the community's help on this one," said Capt. Norman 
Rouillier. "We just don't have a lot to go on, and we need to bring these 
individuals to justice as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Thieves entered Adams' home on Rolland Curtis Place at 2:45 p.m. Sept. 26. 
They bound and gagged Adams and made off with some cash and jewelry, including 
a diamond ring on Adams' finger. Adams died of a heart attack the next morning. 
A neighbor gave a description of one man, but police said others may have been 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, a retired postal worker, was also a minister and community fixture and 
was active in several groups, including the Southwest Division Police Clergy 
Council. A resident of his Southwest area neighborhood for 53 years, the genial 
Adams was a stalwart churchgoer and an avid believer in making positive changes 
happen, friends say.  
</P>
<P>
 "They called him 'Mr. Westminster,' " said Oliver Brown, pastor of Westminster 
Presbyterian Church in Jefferson Park, where Adams was a member for more than 
50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't just a parishioner. . . . He was our clerk, our historian. He was 
just a gentleman's gentleman, a real good guy. We all have to join forces to 
end this awesome violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and others hit the streets, accompanied by police officers, to pass out 
flyers door-to-door and urge residents to come forward with any information. 
Although the group canvassed blocks only within a one-mile radius of the police 
station at King and Denker Avenue, some said they hope the information will 
travel as far as necessary to catch the perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great man. He didn't deserve this," said Timothy Adams, one of 
Adams' four children. "He was very caring, very engaging. It's sad that 
society's come to this, where a person can't live safely in their own home." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved a $25,000 reward in the case at the urging of 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who joined in the canvassing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Adams struck me as a very conscientious, concerned citizen," said 
Ridley-Thomas, who knew Adams through community meetings and also saw him at 
council meetings. "I was struck by his tenacity and diplomacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Police urge anyone with information about the suspects to call (213) 237-1310 
Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. After hours, call (213) 485-2504.

<P>
 In a last-call effort to fight black voter apathy, a national church group is 
calling on churchgoers citywide to vote Tuesday and bring their stubs to 
services Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Local churches participating in Bread for the World, a national alliance of 
churches devoted to fighting world hunger, include five in the Southwest area: 
Holman United Methodist, Messiah Baptist, Ascension Lutheran, West Angeles 
Church of God in Christ and First A.M.E.  
</P>
<P>
 Clergy from these churches are urging parishioners to produce voting stubs in 
a collective show of political force.They are also urging clergy who are not 
Bread for the World members to participate in the voter-stub campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voter apathy is at an all-time high," said Benjamin Epps, pastor of Second 
Baptist Church in South Los Angeles and a Bread for the World board member. 
</P>
<P>
 The big turnout, he said, "will be a remarkable statement of the spiritual 
commitment to our democratic principles of action."

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; 3RD STREET TARGETED BY CLEANUP PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donning orange safety vests and new work gloves, about 80 youths and parents 
last week cleaned up a stretch of 3rd Street, the first phase of an effort to 
keep the area clean while involving young people in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The East L.A. Youth Leadership Council, part of the countywide Hope in Youth 
gang diversion program, has adopted 3rd Street between Ford and Atlantic 
boulevards through the county Public Works Department's Adopt-a-Highway 
program, which has been successful in helping keep highways clean. The group, 
which receives free cleaning equipment from the county, promises to keep the 
stretch tidy for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first Eastside stretch of an unincorporated county street to be 
adopted by an organization for upkeep, said youth organizer Guy Torres. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live close by and we wanted to help uplift the community," said Librada 
Torres, who joined in the cleanup with her children, Manuel, 11, Vanessa, 12, 
and Martin, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooms, shovels, hoes, a box of orange trash bags, ice chests filled with 
sodas and water jugs greeted volunteers as the day's work began. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this positive act, we are hoping to break down the negative stereotypes 
we have heard about young people," said Elaine Sarinana, 16, who addressed the 
group at a King Taco restaurant before starting off down the street. "We are 
challenging other groups to get out there and make a difference and show true 
leadership skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Hope in Youth, a consortium of religious groups and community organizations 
spearheaded by the Catholic Church, grew out of a concern about gang problems. 
Funded by member organizations -- $5.5 million from the city and county and $2 
million from the state -- it counts 11,665 parents and youths as participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, Torres started meeting with about eight teen-agers to talk 
about improving the community, building leadership and job skills and spreading 
the word about the East L.A. Leadership Council. Now, the group numbers about 
40. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that the youth saw as very important," Torres said of the 
cleaning effort last weekend. "You can't tell people about life and how to live 
when they look outside and have no hope." 
</P>
<P>
 In their regular meetings, members of the local group have been learning how 
to prepare for job searches as well as how to organize themselves to help the 
community. The group would like to address such problems as the drop-out and 
teen pregnancy rates, said Brenda Esparza, 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopting 3rd Street was the group's first public effort at improving the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We visualize unity in our community," Esparza said. "We're not against gangs 
or anything, but we're for unity in our families and our community." 
</P>
<P>
 The group plans to pick up trash along the adopted stretch every two weeks -- 
more often if needed. Members also plan to decorate light poles and trees for 
the holidays, clean up graffiti, and eventually expand cleanup efforts to other 
streets.  
</P>
<P>
 "We figure if we raise the standard of living, we can uplift the community," 
Torres said. "These are generally youth who didn't know each other before. It's 
a beautiful thing to see people working for their community. They are leading 
the community in a big way."

IDEAL POLITICS; JIM WALLIS MAY SEEM LIKE A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS -- AN

PULPIT, HE CALLS FOR PEACE, JUSTICE AND TOLERANCE. WHAT'S MORE SURPRISING IS 
THAT WALLIS ACTUALLY PRACTICES WHAT HE PREACHES.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Next to a sidewalk with weeds in every crack, a purple-blossoming plant was 
growing: a petunia, planted by someone as optimistic as the writer and 
political missionary Jim Wallis. On a hot September afternoon, Wallis was 
leading me through a stretch of Washington, D.C., known as the 14th Street 
corridor. The petunia stuck out among the forsaken patches of a neighborhood -- 
Columbia Heights, 20 blocks from the White House -- that has lain in waste 
since the 1968 rioting. Rounding a corner, we came upon five youths standing 
over another young man who was prone on the sidewalk, breathing loudly, his 
face messed up, skin broken, blood running onto his shirt. His assailants 
looked murderous, but, seeing Wallis, they changed their minds and pedaled away 
on bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis signaled to another teen-ager standing nearby. "Get him cleaned up, 
will you, please?" The two were friends, and, arms around each other, 
herky-jerky, they went across the street. It occurred to me that a group of 
avengers with automatic weapons might appear at any second. Wallis, streetwise 
and shaman-like, seemed oblivious to such a danger, and events would bear him 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis has had 20 years to learn how to tell the merely horrible from the 
tragic along the 14th Street corridor. He is the founder and leader of the 
Sojourners Community, a ministry cum commune cum social movement started by 
mostly middle-class, mostly white evangelical Christians who threw in their lot 
with the inhabitants of Columbia Heights in the last gasp of the do-good '60s. 
Wallis and about 50 others live in cooperatively owned row houses there, within 
walking distance of each other. In a former crackhouse, they run education 
programs for adults and children, a tenants' rights organization, a food bank 
and an all-purpose Neighborhood Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis' idea, and the force behind Sojourners, is that bibilical faith compels 
radical social action. While most of us accept the successes wrought by public 
policy on behalf of justice, peace and the poor -- small successes that admit, 
in essence, that injustice, war and poverty will always be with us -- for 
Wallis, that isn't good enough. His conscience leads him to take on these 
issues again and again, firsthand, every day. 
</P>
<P>
 He is surely the only participant in President Clinton's prayer breakfasts who 
chooses to make the 14th Street corridor his home. He regularly gets himself 
arrested in acts of civil disobedience. In a quixotic protest of the wildly 
popular Gulf War, he fasted for 47 days. He presides at the funerals of 
neighborhood youngsters gunned down at close range and then takes on the 
improbable cause of a nationwide gang truce. In the late '80s, he sneaked into 
South Africa to report back on the anti-apartheid movement. When the United 
States was arming the Contras, he mobilized thousands of Witness for Peace and 
joined them in Nicaragua as they made it known that they were willing to take a 
bullet to stop the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be more than just writing about a vision of social 
transformation," the 46-year-old Wallis explained to me. "You have to give your 
life to it -- if necessary, risk your life for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis also preaches what he practices. He travels the lecture circuit half 
the year. When he is at home, he is the lay pastor of the ecumenical 
Sojourner's "church," which meets every Sunday in the Neighborhood Center. He 
contributes to Sojourners magazine, which he co-founded and edits. In his 
just-published third book, "The Soul of Politics," Wallis delivers a sermon 
that has to be called a manifesto. 
</P>
<P>
 The world isn't working. . . . Ideologies and policies of liberal and 
conservative, Left and Right, have run their course and come to a dead end. . . 
. Politics has been reduced to the selfish struggle for power among competing 
interests and groups. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We need a personal ethic of moral responsibility, a social vision based on 
bringing people together, a commitment to justice with the capacity also for 
reconciliation, an economic approach governed by the ethics of community and 
sustainability, a restored sense of our covenant with the abandoned poor and 
the damaged earth, and a renewal of citizen politics to fashion a new political 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 We must, writes Wallis, "find common ground . . . by moving to higher ground" 
-- or perish. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no accident that "The Soul of Politics" arrived on bookshelves at the 
height of another electoral season. Against the 1994 campaigns -- cutthroat, 
cynical, divisive and manipulative -- -Wallis' jeremiad can't help but sound 
like a righteous voice crying in the wilderness, a voice made all the more 
prophetic, according to social critic Cornel West, because of his rare standing 
as "visionary . . . who grounds his reflection in concrete action. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis is politically idealistic beyond the bounds of anything that is 
familiar or conventional in Washington. The fact that he wants the rest of us 
to follow him may make him a saint or God's fool, or maybe an ordinary American 
revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
 The cliche about saints is that they are insufferable in person. In this 
regard Wallis has achieved a breakthrough. He is engaging at a level that wins 
over a wide variety of people. One recent day, he talked business on the phone 
with a financial officer who was with a women's community in the Catholic 
Church's Dominican Order while holding a second conversation, by hand signals, 
with two reformed California gang leaders who had dropped by his office. 
</P>
<P>
 One secret to Wallis' likability is his unpolished, shy social manner: He has 
a stutter; when he's in a hurry, he eats Chinese food with a fork. Also, he is 
willing to admit to periods of heartache and depression. Many evenings, his 
soul is heavier than when the day began. "Washington is in crisis, America is 
in crisis, the world is in crisis and I will sometimes get to a point, 
realizing I am not totally together in my own life either, where I wonder how 
worthwhile is it to go on," he told me. "On those nights I come home, drop in 
my chair and drown out everything with music -- jazz, rock, it doesn't matter. 
I love the soundtrack from the movie 'The Mission,' all those haunting Indian 
wind instruments, but lately I've been listening a lot to the old spirituals; 
they really satisfy my soul." That Wallis goes through his ups and downs, in my 
mind, invests him with a humanity he might otherwise lack. There is suspense in 
his character. 
</P>
<P>
 A man of middle height with a bodybuilder's physique, Wallis has a soft face. 
His burly arms are hairy, his sandy hair is combed in an early rock 'n' roll 
style, his complexion is reddish. The son of a World War II romance, he was 
raised in suburban Detroit in a Middle-American family anchored by the church. 
His home today is a modest brown-brick, two-story row house. The day I visited, 
the smell of burned beans hung in the air; a phone call had distracted him 
while he was cooking supper the night before. Upstairs was a treadmill, the 
only evidence of the boutique spirit of the late 20th Century that I could find 
in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall of his dining room, in a shrine effect, Wallis has affixed about 
25 crucifixes and crosses made of wood or tapestry and collected from around 
the world. On one of them, two thin sticks glued together, the name of a 
Salvadoran priest, Ignacio Ellacuria, and the date of his murder, 11-16-89, has 
been printed. Wallis thought it had been lost in a police storage room -- he 
was carrying it during a protest that resulted in his arrest -- but a police 
officer went to the trouble of retrieving it. "This was a hardened, tough-guy 
cop, a guy you'd expect to stomp on you, but he did a decent thing," Wallis 
said. "So you see why, no matter how down I get, I never stop believing in 
hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the standard positions of the Left or Right, nothing about national 
security or the gross national product, are of much concern to Wallis. What 
drives his activism, both as a citizen of his destitute neighborhood and as a 
citizen of the wider world, is an inclusive and egalitarian 
power-to-the-people, spread-the-wealth, peace-be-with-you morality. The sum of 
his political strategy is to encourage people to take responsibility and fight 
for their own local issues, whether an end to poverty or an end to apartheid. 
The sum of his philosophy is a Christian humanism based on the concept that all 
people were created in the image of God. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the world's religions believe in this concept, imago dei , which is 
to say that the value of each person is the same. A rich person's life is no 
more sacred than a poor person's," he said to me. "If we could only adopt this 
simple concept in our lives, how might the world be transformed?" 
</P>
<P>
 When I asked him about breaking the cycle of poverty and violence in 
neighborhoods like Columbia Heights, he corrected me. "Poverty isn't the root 
problem; poverty leads to hopelessness, which is a deeper, spiritual problem. 
These kids see no reason to grow old. All they own are a few matters of pride. 
That's what they kill each other over. Who flirted with my girlfriend? Who 
looked at me the wrong way? Who disrespected whom?" The ultimate answer, he 
said, lies in the old-fashioned notion of letting people take charge of their 
own lives, referred to popularly these days as "empowerment" and favored 
nominally in Washington by both liberals and conservatives. It is not clear 
what politicians mean by the term, but it is likely a far cry from the sweeping 
forms of self-rule and self-responsibility Wallis has tried to institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sojourners Community has tried to find every means possible whereby its 
mostly African-American neighbors, who now hoard dribs and drabs of income for 
the landlord, can gain their own stake in the city, through expanded tenant 
rights, cooperative housing, accessible mortgages, whatever it takes. As far as 
Wallis can see, neither liberals nor conservatives truly believe in sharing 
power with poor people. "Most conservatives want to abandon the poor, and most 
liberals want to control the poor. There are liberals who give money to our 
little operation solely because they want to stop the violence. They care 
nothing about rebuilding society." 
</P>
<P>
 For some years, the building across the street from Wallis' row house was 
inhabited by crackheads. On one occasion, these neighbors used a heavy object 
to smash through his front door and rummage inside for valuables. Then, 
remarkably, the building was sold to a young professional couple, and the 
addicts were evicted. Over the weeks, Wallis observed the couple, evidently 
well-off, as they converted what had been apartments into a mansion of rooms 
for themselves. A masonry wall was erected out front, topped by a fence of 
black wrought iron. A gate was installed for the driveway, and marigolds and 
geraniums were planted in profusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis had a reaction that cuts against the grain of a materialistic age. "I 
don't know which is the worst evil, the crackhouse or the gentrified house," he 
said to me. He spoke in a mild voice, as if expressing an ordinary opinion, as 
if he was not rebuking most of his peers in contemporary America. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wallis is in Washington, he spends his days at the offices of Sojourners 
magazine, on the outer edge of the corridor in an old Gothic building with 
finely carved moldings and domed-ceiling rooms. For awhile, during the reign of 
the Somoza dynasty in Nicaragua, that country's ambassadors to the United 
States were based in this building. In the 1980s, Wallis devoted many pages of 
the magazine to Nicaragua and caused himself to be arrested at demonstrations, 
all in an attempt to stop the Reagan Administration from returning to power the 
Somozatistas, then called the Contras. The irony of moving into the old Somoza 
embassy, the rent now at ghetto rates, was not lost on Wallis. "We hope by 
being here we can settle a karmic debt," he told me good-naturedly. 
</P>
<P>
 His humor that particular September morning was a little forced. He had just 
learned that the entire Sojourners operation had slipped into yet another 
financial crisis, perhaps the most threatening ever. Revenues for 1994 were 
going to be well short of the projected $1.2-million budget. The magazine might 
have to miss an issue. Layoffs seemed inevitable; there might be payless 
paydays, a nightmare for a staff already stretched to the limit (almost 
everyone who works for the magazine belongs as well to the Sojourners 
Community). They might even be evicted from the old embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a sink-or-swim mood among the Sojourners staffers, many of them 
young heartlanders wearing sandals, shorts and T-shirts, but by the same token, 
everyone seemed to be expecting Wallis to resolve the crisis. He had hoped to 
use the better part of the month to collect himself mentally before embarking 
on a long nationwide tour to promote "The Soul of Politics," but instead, he 
now would have to devote himself to seeking loans from a network of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the occasional grant, money for Sojourners is raised a few dollars 
at a time from magazine subscriptions, direct-mail solicitations and book sales 
(the Sojourners book catalogue has an extensive list of religious Left 
authors). Wallis took a minute in the mail room to confer with two interns who 
were about to ship a copy of his new book to England for an auction of the 
British rights. It would cost $40 for UPS to deliver the book overnight. 
"Better find a cheaper way," Wallis said. He thought a minute, finger to lips. 
"OK, send it UPS, but enclose the bill and ask the publisher to pay." He gave 
me an embarrassed smile. "I hate being poor all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 In his office, the walls postered with quotations from Gandhi and Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. ("Unarmed truth is the most powerful thing in the universe"), 
Wallis dialed the number of a prospective lender, a friend at a nonprofit 
financial cooperative. "I wish I was calling just to say hello," he said into 
the phone, "but, the truth is, our back is against the wall. We need $50,000 in 
the next two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two leaders of Barrios Unidos, a broad-based effort to stop gang 
violence, showed up at his office for lunch. Daniel (Nane) Alejandrez and 
Otilio (O.T.) Quintero, from Santa Cruz, had hit it off with Wallis two years 
ago during preparations for the Gang Summit, an attempt to broker a national 
truce among Crips, Bloods, Vice Lords, Black Disciples, Gangster Disciples, 
Black Souls, Cobras, Stones and Latin Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gang Summit, co-chaired by Alejandrez and by Fred Williams of the Common 
Ground foundation of Los Angeles, was held last year in Kansas City. It had 
several moments of rage that were overcome by praying and gospel singing, and 
thus far the summit truce has exceeded many expectations. Not that Wallis 
didn't have his doubts about it, or about his role as an outside peacemaker. 
"Most of the time I was the only white guy in the room. I could see the 
question in their eyes: 'What the hell is he doing here?' I felt I was being 
continually tested. I think the deciding factor, for me as well as for them, 
was where my home is. I've been living in a war zone for 20 years -- I know 
street violence," he told me. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wallis worked the phones, I asked Alejandrez, a Vietnam veteran and 
onetime heroin addict living in the Santa Cruz barrios, what his first 
impression of Wallis had been. "I don't remember meeting Jim, but I remember, 
later on, thinking, hey, this white guy, he's blending right in," he answered. 
Quintero added: "Jim's not sanctimonious. He's not a guy from some foreign 
white world. He's like one of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandrez and Quintero, sporting business suits and Cesar Chavez buttons, 
were scheduled to meet later in the day with sub-Cabinet officials of the 
Clinton Administration. Their sudden high standing in Washington was owed, in 
part, to Wallis, who had helped underwrite their credibility as owners of small 
businesses. A few months ago, Wallis volunteered to help them obtain funding 
for a sloganeering-T-shirt enterprise and barrio-related computer software; 
given their tattoos and their backgrounds, they were having no luck with 
commercial lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis took the request to Gaylord Thomas, director of community services for 
the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, headquartered in Chicago. The 
selling job was not made any easier by the arrest of one of Wallis' closest 
allies in the gang world, the Vice Lord leader Sharif Willis, implicated in the 
killing of a Minneapolis police officer. While no charges were filed against 
Willis, the front-page headlines about the gang-related homicide in the Midwest 
reinforced an understandable nervousness about associating with gangs. 
Nonetheless, a $100,000 loan for Barrios Unidos from the Lutheran church is 
being arranged. "It was out of the respect and love I have for Jim that I went 
ahead," Thomas, who is African American, told me. 
</P>
<P>
 Having finally put down the phone, Wallis explained in a matter-of-fact voice 
the state of emergency now surrounding Sojourners. Alejandrez stood up and 
pulled Wallis into a big hug. "You can't go under," he said emotionally. 
"You're the mouthpiece. We need you." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis looked straight at him. "We will not go under," he said. He may not 
have the manner of the fiery televangelists, but the fire is there. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch, far behind schedule, was to be takeout chicken and Chinese vegetables. 
Wallis discussed economic development and how groups such as Barrios Unidos 
could access a pot of gold, altogether about $35 billion, that exists in the 
pension funds of Christian denominations. "It's invested in blue-chip stocks, 
doing absolutely no good for anybody except the blue-chip companies," Wallis 
said. "If Jesus were on Earth, he would tell the churches to give the whole $35 
billion away, give it to the poor. All I'm asking is for them to move it around 
a little, invest it in projects like yours." 
</P>
<P>
 Might Wallis be able to tap into the pension funds for his own organization? 
"No, probably not. You have to look far and wide for a source of money that we 
qualify for." 
</P>
<P>
 Difficult as it is for someone stigmatized by the violence of gangs to raise 
money, it may be even more difficult for Wallis, the veteran pacifist. The 
ambiguity of Sojourners, in terms of standard political ideology, makes him an 
alien among the professional fund-raisers aligned with either the Christian 
Right or the public-interest Left. "Sojourners falls between the cracks. We are 
anathema to both sides," he explained. "The Christian Right will not help us 
because we talk about racial and economic justice and are opposed to war; the 
liberal-funding world is remarkably biased against religion." 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to understand why Wallis has found little common ground with a 
Christian rightist like William J. Bennett, who codified the Republican vision 
of self-determination in his recent bestseller, "The Book of Virtues." Bennett 
promulgates resistance to change, whereas Wallis seeks transformation and will 
settle for reform. Wallis traded point-and-counterpoint with Bennett in June at 
the Christian Booksellers convention in Denver. Said Bennett, calling in by 
speaker phone: "Why is it that Christians are not welcome in the national 
political debate?" Replied Wallis: "Why is it that progressive evangelicals 
aren't welcome in the Christian debate?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis has even less in common with Jerry L. Falwell, founder of the Moral 
Majority Inc., with whom he also has tangled in public. Kindness to his enemies 
is considered one of Wallis' political failings, but he had notably unkind 
words for Falwell: "He is blustery, always interrupting, and he is combative 
where Bennett is scholarly." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the estrangement between Wallis and the liberal 
establishment was to me a little less understandable. It is true that Wallis 
doesn't toe the line of pure liberalism; his position on abortion, for example, 
is notably tortured. In his new book, he lets his female counterparts speak on 
the issue, and they come down on the side that almost all abortion is immoral, 
but that criminalizing it is no answer. Wallis believes it should be society's 
goal to eliminate any need for abortion. But the Left's real problem with 
Wallis, according to the politically idiosyncratic author Garry Wills, who is a 
contributor to Sojourners magazine and something of a politial loner himself, 
is "the learned liberal superstition that the separation of church and state 
must mean the separation of religion and politics." 
</P>
<P>
 For Wallis' part, he has taken pains to separate himself from the Left as well 
as the Right. "(Both) have run their course and come to a dead end," he 
declares in the introduction of his new book. "Liberalism is unable to 
articulate or demonstrate the kind of moral values that must undergird any 
serious movement of social transformation. . . . Conservatism still denies the 
reality of structural injustice and social oppression." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis was on the phone again when our lunch was delivered. Alejandrez, 
Quintero and I ate off cracked china plates at a coffee table. Hanging up, 
Wallis managed only two mouthfuls before another call interrupted. Linda 
Wertheimer, at National Public Radio, was asking him to rush over to the studio 
to be interviewed about Haiti. "I don't have an easy solution for Haiti," he 
said, "but OK." 
</P>
<P>
 We piled into one of the Sojourners vehicles, a pickup truck, and crossed into 
downtown Washington, the well-dressed Alejandrez and Quintero acting out an 
impromptu bit of mad-lark theater from their perch on wheel rims in back, 
scanning the streets and playing the part of Secret Service agents. At that 
moment President Clinton was hours away from a televised speech announcing a 
countdown to an invasion of Haiti. Bob Dole, the Republican leader of the U.S. 
Senate, had already declared his opposition, saying: "I don't think invading 
Haiti . . . is worth one American life." Most Democrats, however, justified an 
invasion as a necessary evil in the furtherance of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the point Wertheimer tried to drive home in her interview with 
Wallis, and, listening, I began to have a better understanding of the 
difficulties he poses for anyone who wants to define things with neat political 
labels. Even while dismissing Dole's view ("I hear racism in that statement"), 
Wallis criticized Clinton for trying to make the ends justify the means. The 
issue for Wallis was that an invasion would cost lives, American and Haitian. 
"People are going to die. I can't defend that." His belief in the sanctity of 
life is one of the constants on which he has predicated politics for nearly 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertheimer, who clearly accepted the inevitability of a military invasion, 
grew exasperated with Wallis and demanded that he come up with an alternative. 
Reluctant to add to his criticism of Clinton, of whom Wallis is generally 
respectful, he allowed, "It's an agonizing decision." But then, pressed 
further, Wallis took a breath and laid out his solution. He spoke in a clear 
baritone; his stutter had disappeared as soon as he entered the radio booth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, some of us have been talking about a different kind of invasion, an 
unarmed invasion of religious leaders. Why not send in a boatload of ministers 
and teachers with several tons of food? I think you could find enough of us who 
would put our lives on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Realpolitik, Wallis style. Wertheimer wasn't buying it. She talked right past 
him and ushered us out with a tight smile: "We might be able to use some of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 On our way out, a tanned, easily recognized man joined us in the elevator: 
George McGovern, just back from talks in Cuba with Fidel Castro. Wallis 
extended a hand, "Hello, senator." After a few seconds sorting through his 
memories, McGovern said delightedly, "Jim Wallis. You were the seminarian who 
was banned from campus." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, after making a radical name for himself in anti-war and civil-rights 
protests at Michigan State University, Wallis enrolled for postgraduate studies 
at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Ill. There he organized 
prayer vigils for Vietnam peace, which he justified to his professors with 
neglected passages of the Bible. Alumni tried to have him expelled, and at 
nearby Wheaton College, another conservative Christian school where he also 
spoke against the war, he was banned from subsequent formal speaking 
engagements. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, when an anti-war McGovern, himself a former seminarian, challenged 
Nixon for the presidency, Wallis brashly volunteered to arrange for a 
candidates' night at Wheaton. Wallis sneaked onto the campus ("I had to go by 
night like Nicodemus") and persuaded the student government to ask both Nixon 
and McGovern to appear. Richard Nixon declined the invitation, so McGovern got 
his chance alone. 
</P>
<P>
 McGovern seemed to impress the superpatriotic Wheaton students, although the 
presidential election was a lost cause. After his defeat, McGovern sought 
counsel from a number of religious leaders, including Wallis. "He was 
extremely, extremely downhearted. I remember saying to him, young as I was, 
'Well, senator, this might be a backward step, but it's only one step in a long 
struggle. You have to carry on,' " he said, smiling at his earnestness. 
</P>
<P>
 Since age 14, Wallis had known he wanted to turn his life into a mission. It 
was not at the urging of his parents, who, although they were founders of a 
Bible-based church, had raised him in Little League and Boy Scouts and public 
school. "To them, faith was a personal act. They didn't relate it to people's 
suffering on the larger scale of war or racism. But I kept asking, why do we 
live in this nice little white, middle-class enclave, while a mile away, black 
people are living in slums? Eventually I got in so much trouble with my 
parents' church over this issue that I spent my teen-age years attending black 
churches in Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis never got a degree at Trinity, probably much to that institution's 
relief. After the anti-war movement was rendered moot and the civil-rights 
movement finished its heyday, Wallis tried to figure out what to do with the 
rest of his life. He came up with a list of essentials. He wanted to establish 
a national forum for the discussion of religion and social action; he wanted to 
provide a place for spiritual renewal, a nondenominational church; he wanted to 
live tribally among friends and colleagues, and there would have to be a way in 
which he could do service to the poor. Among the '60s generation, there were a 
lot of namby-pamby, wouldn't-it-be-nice approaches to doing good. Wallis, the 
quintessential idealist, took a more pragmatic approach and succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Forming the Sojourners group with friends from Trinity, Wallis located first 
in Chicago, then, as of 1975, in the Fourteenth Street corridor. Five years 
later, as the high-living -- some might say greedy -- '80s kicked off, Wallis 
would be leading a community of about 45, who pooled their income, mostly from 
Sojourners magazine, which had a circulation of 45,000. Dozens of neighborhood 
residents would flock every Sunday to Sojourners services, which were 
nondenominational and led by lay pastors. A day-care center would be up and 
running, and Wallis would tell a Washington Post reporter, "We've become a 
fixture in landlord-tenant court." 
</P>
<P>
 From time to time, Wallis is asked by strangers if he has ever contemplated 
pulling up his roots in the corridor. "Yes, I've thought of getting out," he 
tells them, in much the same way you or I might say we've thought at times of 
being Good Samaritans ourselves in a place like Columbia Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 In the abstract, you can fool yourself into believing that Wallis is not so 
different from the rest of us. That is especially so if, like me, you came of 
age in the '60s. Wallis and I have lived in proximity most of our lives, 
growing up in similar Michigan households, protesting the war on Michigan 
campuses, even getting tear-gassed in 1969 at a stop-the-war protest in 
Washington. Both of us became writers and settled in the capital. However, 
Wallis has always resided inside the city limits, and I outside them, just 10 
miles apart, but a distance that constitutes a world of difference. 
</P>
<P>
 After I met Wallis, the abstract became concrete: He is not likely to move out 
of the 14th Street corridor, and I am not likely to move in. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sojourners office, a piece of good news had arrived -- the likelihood 
of $25,000 in short-term credit. Wallis, who has a good Midwesterner's aversion 
to debt and a conservative's sense of self-responsibility, began immediately to 
scheme about ways to repay the loan. Perhaps the new book would bring in a 
bonanza of new members. "We could use that cash to pay it off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or we could use that cash to pay off the rest of our bills so we're not all 
bald by Christmas from tearing out our hair," interjected Elizabeth Holler 
Hunter, the thin, tense-looking director of development for Sojourners. She was 
trying to be flip, but her voice was all worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "By Christmas, this will all seem like a bad dream, I hope," Wallis said, 
patting her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 A man in Wallis' position is obliged to be reassuring, to make things appear 
stable. But there is nothing stable about day-to-day existence for Sojourners 
or the corridor. Life in these communities will always be life on the edge. 
When Wallis first moved into Columbia Heights, many houses were boarded up, and 
9 of 10 of the others were occupied by African-American renters. Today, there 
are significantly more property owners, but there is greater enmity. "Now there 
are warring factions: the Latino immigrants against the African Americans, the 
white homeowners against the tenants. The tensions are very high," Barbara 
Tamialis, who is Wallis' sister, told me. 
</P>
<P>
 The prematurely silver-haired Tamialis, who is a year younger than her 
brother, has lived in the corridor as part of Sojourners from the beginning. 
She directs the Neighborhood Center. With her husband, Jim, a high school math 
instructor and the guitar player at Sojouners services, she has raised three 
children in the corridor and now is valiantly raising two more, an 8-year-old 
adopted as an infant and a 9-year-old rescued from the foster-care system. A 
decision was made to send the three oldest Tamialis kids to public schools 
outside the corridor. The reasons were practical ones. "Our children always 
played with the neighborhood kids," their mother said, "but the teachers were 
teaching them to hit back while we were teaching them not to hit. And the 
schools were at a lower level." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the adversities that the Tamialis family has suffered over the years, 
their row house broken into and so forth, and for all the violence visited upon 
neighborhood children they have watched grow up and die, they are not drawn to 
the suburbs. "It's not nirvana out there. The suicide rate is higher in the 
suburbs. Wherever you live, you pick your poison," Barbara Tamialis said. 
"There are different pluses to the suburbs, but also different minuses. When 
you add it all up, I do not consider living here a sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact remains, though, that the life Wallis has chosen -- not just the mean 
streets, but also the times in jail, the risks to life and limb in far-off 
places, the denial of security and many creature comforts -- is a reminder of 
why the ranks of priesthoods are often filled by loners. Not until a few years 
ago did Wallis marry, after falling in love with a young woman who happened to 
join Sojourners. Now divorced from her, he will not talk for the public record 
about his marriage, except to say "it has been the most painful chapter of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis has friends inside Sojourners, some as close as family, and he has 
blood relatives there in the Tamialises ("There are days when I truly thank God 
for Barbara and Jim"). At times he has had house mates; once, after trying 
unsuccessfully to prevent the eviction of a neighbor and her son, he ended up 
sharing his house with them for several months. Yet the sum of his personal 
existence today is that he is a middle-aged man who finishes his day alone, the 
music up loud. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after Wallis suggested at NPR that the Clinton Administration consider 
an unarmed invasion of Haiti, former President Jimmy Carter, the most prominent 
of America's progressive evangelicals, began negotiations on Clinton's behalf. 
The Carter-led talks in Haiti avoided a war but drew ridicule from many 
conservatives and not a few liberals who claimed that the former President, 
while saving lives, had let moral issues dominate the national interest, 
undercutting Clinton's strong-arm policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis has also been accused of naively choosing the human over the political. 
I asked him whether tipping the balance in such a direction doesn't make the 
U.S. government appear weak and indecisive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Governments are fully capable of looking after their own interests. The 
balance is always tipped in their favor. Governments are survivors. Politicians 
are survivors. It's the people who do the dying -- usually to pay for the sins 
of the politicians -- and they need all the advocacy they can get," he said to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. soldiers who finally landed on Haiti, while under orders to shoot if 
necessary, represented less a conquering force than a band of guidance 
counselors and security guards -- which was, I realized, a not unreasonable 
variation of the solution Wallis had put forward. 
</P>
<P>
 And as it turned out, in Haiti at least, Carter and Wallis -- not to mention 
Bill Clinton -- would be redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Sunday evening before Wallis was to depart on his book tour, the 
Sojourners congregation gathered for services, sitting on folding chairs in the 
living room of the old crackhouse. On a cloth-covered table there was a loaf of 
bread and a pitcher of grape juice, and on the wall a peace-dove banner. For 
most of a month, Wallis had been soliciting money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a family, and we've all been worried about what's going to happen to 
us," he said in his preacher's voice, sans stutter, rocking on his toes at a 
wooden lectern. "We've raised $40,000 so far, but I'm exhausted at the thought 
of all we have to raise to keep our little ministry going." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, somewhere in the corridor, a woman screamed. Wallis went on. "And, I 
will tell you truthfully, I am also exhausted from all the anger and violence 
and political polarization we see in Washington every day. I can feel the flood 
rising, and I wonder, can we stop it?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks since we had met, Wallis seemed to have aged noticeably. Some of 
his hollow look was from lack of sleep, but a lot of it was the strain of 
holding together his host of quixotic endeavors. Wallis might be devoid of 
cynicism, I had come to realize, but he is not someone untouched by life. 
</P>
<P>
 After the services I asked him what he planned to do next. "Buy a couple pairs 
of socks and a toothbrush and get my weary butt ready for this book tour. I can 
raise money from the road if I have to," he said, flashing a strangely upbeat 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 What, after all this time, keeps him going? "That's a good question," he said. 
"I know many people admire the work I do, but most of them think I'm crazy. All 
I can tell you is I'm doing the work I've always wanted to do. Call it the 
Lord's work, call it anything you like. For me, that's enough."

THE PROMISED LAND; IN WORLD WAR II, FILIPINOS WERE TOLD IF THEY FOUGHT FOR 
AMERICA THEY WOULD BECOME U.S. CITIZENS. LITTLE DID THEY KNOW IT WOULD TAKE 
DECADES BEFORE THAT VOW WAS HONORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As his troops took a beating in the Pacific, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
using the promise of U.S. citizenship, recruited tens of thousands of Filipino 
men into the armed services at the outset of World War II. But after the war, 
the Philippines government, fearing the loss of young men needed to rebuild the 
country, pressured the United States to rescind the agreement. For the more 
than 175,000 who had fought, holding off Japanese soldiers in grim jungle 
battles and suffering torture in prisoner-of-war camps, it was a stunning 
reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the decades that followed, a handful of the Filipino soldiers managed to 
obtain citizenship through lengthy court battles. Finally, after voluminous 
letter-writing campaigns by the men and their supporters, Congress addressed 
the problem in 1990 in sweeping immigration reform legislation that extended 
U.S. citizenship to the estimated 100,000 remaining eligible veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 For the men, all now in their mid-60s to mid-90s, it was a bittersweet 
victory. As the newly qualified veterans began to apply for citizenship, 
"facilitators" opened shops to assist them, charging as much as $1,000 to 
complete paperwork that would have cost an applicant $90 to process unassisted, 
the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism reported. In California, 
where more than 10,000 Filipino soldiers immigrated, there have been startling 
charges. Rick Rocamora, who began photographing the veterans in 1992, was told 
that several soldiers in a Contra Costa County community allegedly had suffered 
physical abuse at the hands of facilitators. The veterans have filed a civil 
suit, which goes to trial early next year, claiming that they were held against 
their will and forced to do manual labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the long-awaited citizenship, the veterans have little to celebrate; 
many are homeless or live in substandard housing, eating in food kitchens. Yet 
in spite of their ordeal, Rocamora says none have voiced a desire to return to 
the Philippines. Daily they meet on street corners from San Diego to San 
Francisco, in shopping malls and senior citizen centers, to reminisce about the 
war. Seventy-nine-year-old Pablo Dungo displays a U.S. Army uniform on a wall 
of a San Francisco studio apartment he shares with three other veterans. "When 
I die, I would like to be buried in that uniform. I am proud of fighting under 
the U.S. flag," he says. Rick Rocamora is an Oakland-based photographer whose 
book "Eyes on Cuba" will be published by Temple University Press next year.

FILM CLIPS / EMBRYONIC IDEA: 'JUNIOR' HAS REAL OMENTUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Picture the epitome of glowing expectant motherhood and you might think of the 
Madonna and child through the ages, or even Demi Moore on the cover of Vanity 
Fair. You probably wouldn't think of a cigar-chomping Arnold Schwarzenegger in 
the throes of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's exactly what Ivan Reitman's "Junior," which co-stars Danny DeVito 
and opens Nov. 23, will present onscreen. 
</P>
<P>
 A few TV shows -- and the tacky Joan Rivers/Billy Crystal 1978 film "Rabbit 
Test" -- have dabbled with the notion of male pregnancy. But it took a very ill 
and very bored Chris Conrad to delve into real scientific studies on the 
subject, and come up with a relatively believable -- at least in Hollywood 
terms -- story idea (she shares writing credit with Kevin Wade). 
</P>
<P>
 Could the male psyche, for example, handle the erratic emotional landscape a 
woman typically suffers for nine months? What about morning sickness? The 
ballooning midriff? Cravings? (Not to mention the getting pregnant part.) 
</P>
<P>
 After suffering a divorce and illness in the late 1980s, Conrad found herself 
convalescing and worrying about her future. A former editor at Warner Books, 
former head of New York's Film, Television and Theater Office and screenwriter, 
she decided she wanted to write again. 
</P>
<P>
 "There I was in the hospital, no husband, worrying about my income at (age) 
45. So I say, 'I better get a big idea and resurrect my career, fast,' " she 
says. She happened to spot an article about a sex therapists' convention at 
which the topic under discussion was male pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a comedy!" she says. "Nothing could put a man more in jeopardy than 
being pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
 She began to research the subject, and was more than a little stunned to learn 
that male pregnancy is not as far-fetched a notion as one might think.  
</P>
<P>
 An embryo could be produced by extracting an egg from the ovary and 
fertilizing it with sperm in a petri dish -- the technique used in in-vitro 
fertilization. The embryo then would be implanted into the man's abdominal 
cavity against the blood-rich, fatty tissue in front of the intestines called 
the omentum, which would be a surrogate uterus, develop a placenta and nourish 
the growing life. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine months and a lot of help from supplemental hormones, Mr. Mom would 
undergo an operation similar to a Cesarean section for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgical experts whom Conrad consulted say that it's all in the realm of 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Carl J. Hauser, associate professor of surgery at the University of 
Mississippi, says, "Abdominal pregnancies are not only possible, but they've 
occurred. The problem with them is the blood supply is usually inadequate. Will 
we ever see them in men? Most things are possible, but I don't think the 
abdomen will ever replace the uterus as the optimum place for the fetus." 
</P>
<P>
 Omni magazine reported that an Auckland, New Zealand, woman, who had undergone 
a hysterectomy, gave birth to a five-pound baby girl in May, 1979, from an 
abdominal preg nancy. It also noted that in the mid-'60s, researchers 
transplanted the fertilized egg of a female baboon into a male's abdomen. The 
embryo attached itself to the omentum and the male carried the fetus to term. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinical aspects aside, there's an emotional factor. In "Junior," 
Schwarzenegger's character suffers insecurity with his mate (in this case, his 
research partner, DeVito), hypersensitivity, a motherly glow, a voracious 
appetite and a fascination with his changing body.  
</P>
<P>
 "Beyond that," says Conrad, "the story is sort of similar to 'Tootsie' but 
takes it one step further. What (Schwarzenegger's character) really learns is 
to be a better man by being a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 But director Reitman says it was the plausibility of the idea that attracted 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that was great about Chris' script is that she took a very 
scientific approach," he says. "A man could get pregnant now, even though it 
would probably kill the guy! 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could say I'm no stranger to obscure story lines. I had been 
thinking of doing a sequel to 'Twins' with Danny and Arnold but this seemed so 
much better," he says. "Once I read it, I couldn't think of anyone else who 
could play nine months pregnant better than Arnold."*

FILM CLIPS / MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON: SEEDY N.Y. SETTING SUITS LATEST 'VANYA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 "You have the feeling in the movie of some strange band of eccentric lunatics 
who is hiding in this odd, wondrous deteriorating place to make something that 
they still care about, love about and are passionate about." 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Gregory is describing the characters of Louis Malle's newest film, 
"Vanya on 42nd Street," a thoroughly postmodern treatment of Chekhov's "Uncle 
Vanya," which opened Friday. But Gregory, of Malle's "My Dinner With Andre" 
fame, is the director of the play- within- the- movie, and might just as well 
have been describing the motley crew of select visitors to the set on the last 
day of shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vanya on 42nd Street" was shot in New York in a breathtaking 11 shooting days 
in the spectacularly decrepit New Amsterdam Theater on seedy 42nd Street, just 
off Times Square. Built in 1903, the crumbling New Amsterdam was once the 
baroquely ornate showcase for the "Ziegfeld Follies" and, much later, a porno 
theater; abandoned for 40 years and now closed to the public, it is a maze of 
peeling gold gilt, gaping second-story doorways arching to nowhere, and 
intricately stained, rain-soaked walls. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be hope for the Art Nouveau masterpiece -- Disney has plans to 
renovate it, an effort that could help jump-start a long-hoped-for rebirth of 
the city's blighted theater district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On this chilly May day, though, renovation is but a dim promise. Halfway 
through this afternoon's filming, the nonplussed lighting crew dodges a sudden 
shower of plaster falling from a huge bas-relief flower bud precariously 
drooping from the balcony ceiling. Later, Gregory remarks on the choice of 
location, which he and Malle loved from the minute they saw it. "If Brian De 
Palma made a movie about 'Phantom of the Opera,' " Gregory says, "this is where 
it would take place." (Gregory apparently forgot De Palma's 1974 rock version 
of "Phantom," called "Phantom of the Paradise.") 
</P>
<P>
 "Vanya on 42nd Street" is based on Gregory's unusual staging of Chekhov's 
classic, from a modern adaptation written by David Mamet. The film reunites 
Malle and Gregory with fellow "My Dinner With Andre" collaborator Wallace 
Shawn, in the title role, as well as most of the original cast from Gregory's 
production, including Julianne Moore, Brooke Smith and Larry Pine.  
</P>
<P>
 The play was staged sporadically from 1989 to '92 -- when the actors could 
snatch a week or two free from their work in features or television. Rehearsals 
began in a loft, then moved to the decaying Victory Theater, just down the 
street from the New Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
 Malle was one of a select group of devotees of Gregory's staging, in which the 
audience sat on the stage, carrying their chairs as they followed the actors 
around the set, even sitting across from them at a table in some scenes. The 
play was staged as an open rehearsal, so that neither audience nor actors knew 
exactly what would happen that night, creating what Gregory calls an 
"atmosphere, as in life, of dangerous spontaneity." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience was a handpicked group of friends and colleagues of the cast and 
stage crew. Among them, directors Robert Altman, Mike Nichols and Arthur Penn 
all agreed that the adaptation would make a "phenomenal" movie. (Altman cast 
Julianne Moore in "Short Cuts" after seeing her play Yelena.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Gregory couldn't imagine "any other director who would do this as Louis 
Malle would. Part of it was that he was so passionate and loved it, and he so 
truly understood it." Malle brought in Fred Berner ("Alamo Bay") as producer 
and Declan Quinn ("Ballad of Little Jo") as cinematographer. 
</P>
<P>
 B ut perhaps the most compel ling screen presence is that of the New Amsterdam 
itself, whose crumbling ceiling, rotting beams and vast empty spaces -- it is 
10 stories high -- loom over the activities onstage with as much intensity as 
any of the performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory acknowledged that the intensity of the film's shooting schedule helped 
bring the immediacy of the stage performances to the camera. "The play has a 
very strong sense of time is passing . . . which is heightened in the film by 
the sense of how are we ever going to finish this?" 
</P>
<P>
 That question hovers over the cast and crew tonight, the last night of 
filming. Louis Malle is dressed in a red down vest and duckbill hat against the 
chill in the unheated New Amsterdam, his unshaven face haggard. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the schedule, Malle maintains his famous calm on the set, meticulously 
blocking every move by every character. Malle shot the scenes in succession, to 
help the actors maintain emotional continuity. Setting up for the crucial last 
scene -- with its litany of restless exits and entrances -- has taken hours. 
Malle snaps only once, actually during a picture-taking break off the set that 
takes too long. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Vanya," Gregory plays himself, the stage director. Although we never see 
him actually working with the actors in the film, he appears in the opening 
scene on the gritty wintry street outside the theater, and at other points in 
the background as the drama unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an amazing collaboration (between Gregory as the stage director and 
Malle as the film's director) because we never had a disagreement, which given 
the fact that we were shooting under such pressure and that we are both such 
strong directors is a kind of miracle. Quite naturally, it fell into my 
directing the actors and his setting up the camera shots." 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the actors had been rehearsing since 1989. Gregory describes his 
original direction of the play as "referential to film," in that audience 
members sitting across from actors are like cameras, "shooting where they 
wanted to look, and always looking in close-up." 
</P>
<P>
 Malle's challenge was to reverse the coin and make a film that was referential 
to theater. Gregory believes the behind-the-scenes approach will have great 
popular appeal. "I think audiences love that backstage feeling."*

STAR KICK RETURNER FIGHTS HAVING TO PUNT CAREER; TOP PROSPECT DARRELL COOLEY 
MUST WORK OUT FAMILY, GRADE PROBLEMS TO GET BACK ON THE FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ETHAN ALLEN THOMAS JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last season Darrell Cooley used swift moves and stunning speed to fly by 
tacklers and run down receivers at L.A. Southwest College. The former Jefferson 
High star earned conference-leading statistics, All-State team honors and 
recruitment letters from prestigious universities throughout the country. 
Coaches said his exceptional talents could even take him to the National 
Football League someday. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, returning punts and defending receivers are the furthest things from 
Darrell Cooley's mind -- and life. Cooley's focus is on the vexing 
responsibility of raising his 4-year-old daughter Aleisha and providing her 
with a place to live. But Cooley's problem is twofold. He also has to cope with 
being academically ineligible for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 "What caused the grades problem was that I didn't have a place to stay. . . . 
My pop threw me out on the streets," the defensive back and kick returner said. 
"(Before that) I was in school every day. I was doing everything I was supposed 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Awarded custody after a court battle with the mother, Cooley and Aleisha were 
living with his father in Los Angeles last spring. But the house was crowded, 
tempers flared and after an irreconcilable argument with his stepmother, the 
20-year-old football star and his little girl were forced to find shelter with 
his mother in 29 Palms.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 150 miles away from school and only three weeks from the end of spring 
semester, Cooley missed his final exams and his grade-point average dropped 
below the 2.0 needed to keep his eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 So in the season he would have spent chasing ballcarriers, studying and 
narrowing his choices for the big-name school lucky enough to have him, Cooley 
has lived a vagabond life.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He and his daughter have moved back and forth across the Los Angeles basin, 
staying with relatives in 29 Palms, Van Nuys -- even, for a time, deep in the 
heart of South-Central where Cooley grew up, in "the Pueblos," a congested, 
gang-infested government housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooley belonged to the gang for a while, joining while in elementary school 
and leaving in high school, when his athletic career began to blossom. "That's 
not what I'm about any more. . . . And they (members of the Pueblos) know it," 
Cooley said. "I've been out since this college stuff started gettin' for real. 
Since the letters started rollin' in." 
</P>
<P>
 But since his academic and football career were sidelined, Cooley has done 
more spinning than rolling. Still unsettled, living for now at his uncle's 
house in Van Nuys on $490 in government aid, Cooley has been cast into a role 
that many teen-age mothers have found themselves in. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we went to court, they (authorities) found me to be a better parent than 
her," Cooley said. And even as he struggles financially, without new employment 
in sight, he refuses to seek additional help from county officials. "I don't 
want them to think I can't take care of my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the resources provided by the government have been limited, he has 
received assistance from Family Preservation, a Los Angeles-based agency, which 
helps him with parenting counseling and locating government-subsidized housing. 
 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Cooley predicts that his return to college will be in the spring, he 
still has obstacles to overcome: He's "not in tip-top shape," although he plays 
basketball often; until he has a place to settle down, he doesn't want to go 
back to school; and once back in school he must maintain a C average to play 
ball again and draw attention from a four-year school. 
</P>
<P>
 That school would get a player who last season led the Western State 
Conference with six interceptions. Using his 4.4 40-yard-dash speed, the 
6-foot, 190-pounder returned two of the interceptions for touchdowns of 92 and 
106 yards. As a kick returner he led the conference with an average return of 
30.1 yards a kick, including a 93-yard touchdown return. The All-State 
defensive back also led in punt returns, averaging 23.5 yards per return. If 
Cooley's stats don't speak for his ability, coaches do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cooley has tremendous talent," says Hank Johnson, Cooley's coach and dean at 
Jefferson. "It's very seldom when coaches see a kid in high school and say he 
can be a Division I player, and then take it to the next level and go to the 
NFL. Darrell Cooley was definitely one of those players." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a big-play ballplayer. He was that in high school, and he is at this 
level," said L.A. Southwest coach Henry Washington last spring. "People take a 
big chance when they throw at him. He's a great football player." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooley is confident he can get himself back on track as a student-athlete and 
remain a good parent, but his plight worries others. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson fears that inactivity may lead to the demise of his young football 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like football," Johnson said. "You have three downs. If you can't make 
it in three, why do you think you're going to make it on fourth down? A lot of 
kids say they're going to come back after missing a year, but they never do. 
Coming back entails going to class and keeping his grades up." 
</P>
<P>
 Recruited by Division I powers Texas, Pittsburgh, USC and UCLA, Cooley said 
his high school grades, accompanied by the lack of a SAT score, combined to 
send him to a junior college. His grades also prompted concern in his coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington voiced concern last season in an interview with The Times. "He's a 
Division I player in every sense of the word. But he still has a way to go as a 
student. . . . He's a very capable person. It's just a case of him applying 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 And, recently, Washington reiterated his concern: "Darrell is a very good 
person; he just couldn't find his way to class."  
</P>
<P>
 Cooley, though, faces the future with determination and optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard not playing and missing the whole season," he said. "But after I 
handle my business, I'll be back next year."

OPERA RHAPSODIST JAMES MCCOURT TALKS WITH THE LEGENDARY VICTORIA DE LOS 
ANGELES, WHO IS CELEBRATING HER 50TH YEAR ONSTAGE; DUET WITH A DIVA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MCCOURT, James McCourt is the author of Kaye Wayfaring in 'Avenged,' 
Time Remaining and Mawrdew Cvgowchwz, the saga of the ultimate opera diva. He 
is working on a biography of Victoria de los Angeles for Knopf. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victoria de los Angeles has changed. The dark diva with the gloriously soulful 
eyes, whose image illuminated the closing ceremony of the 1992 Olympics, has 
just turned 71. The city of Barcelona turned out in force to celebrate De los 
Angeles' 50th year on stage, one of the longest careers in the history of 
opera. In 1944, she made her professional debut at the Palau de la Musica, 
where, last May, the crowds covered her with carnations and swathed the stage 
in bouquets when she finished her recital. She is one of the most beloved of 
opera stars, the last surviving working diva of the golden age of the first 
LPs, the fabulous '50s, when technology was content to record the truth of 
voices without resort to electronic enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling a schedule of engagements that would break singers half her age, De 
los Angeles refuses to slow down. After giving master classes at a university 
in Santander, Spain, this summer, she took off for a series of recitals in 
Japan. But there have been few histrionics in this ornate career: no 
sensationally rich husbands, no wild temper tantrums (well, there was just that 
one fracas during a recording session of "Carmen"). She is not that kind of 
diva, hers is not that kind of life. She has always been discreet, the darling 
of European music. Perhaps having now achieved legendary status, she feels 
comfortable scoring the world of opera and some of the creatures that inhabit 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 The morning Barcelona's great opera house, the Liceo, was gutted by fire, 
Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballe -- nowadays as famous for blatant media 
gestures as she once was for engorged tone, hyper-attenuated phrasing, 
relentless pianissimi and eccentric professional demeanor -- arrived with a 
television crew, stood in the smoking rubble and sang "The Song of the Birds," 
the most popular of all Catalan folk songs and the very one with which Victoria 
de los Angeles had closed the 1992 Olympics. Reached for comment, De los 
Angeles snipped to the Times of London, " 'The Song of the Birds.' Well, there 
lies the poor dead thing, and already the vultures are beginning to circle 
overhead." Since then, Victoria repeatedly, as if she were learning a new song, 
expresses the hope that the new Liceo should be a theater "without cabals." 
</P>
<P>
 And as for Sir Rudolf Bing, the former director of New York's Metropolitan 
Opera House, more on him later. 
</P>
<P>
 SANTANDER, A DOUBLE CRESCENT BAY RINGED WITH MOUNTAINS IN CANTABRIA, in 
northern Spain, is a sort of Laguna Beach with tamarind trees instead of palms, 
made popular as a royal summer resort for Victoria Eugenia, a granddaughter of 
England's queen, and featuring a palace called the Magdalena -- a kind of San 
Simeon crossed with Balmoral -- out on a promontory. There, in the main 
auditorium in what were once the palace stables, the De los Angeles master 
classes ran for a week, from 4 in the afternoon till 10 in the evening. It was 
for me a week of strange, masochistic nostalgia, sitting in an auditorium 
listening to work being done on the students' chosen roles -- the same roles 
Victoria had defined for a generation in the '50s: Mimi in Puccini's "La 
Boheme," the title role in Massenet's "Manon," Marguerite in Gounod's "Faust" 
and the Countess in Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro." Hearing in her 
demonstrations the identical tonality and coloration I'd experienced as a high 
school sophomore (to mistake the De los Angeles voice for another has never 
been possible: you either know exactly who that is or you have no idea) was 
more than a bit disconcerting. So it was good to sit up again, late into the 
evening, talking about opera, and much else, over supper. 
</P>
<P>
 "This must be strange for you as an American," one of the university 
functionaries politely said to me, "eating at this hour?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really -- not for a New Yorker who grew up going to the theater, the 
opera and Carnegie Hall and then to restaurants afterward. Then too, Victoria 
and I have always had what I call this pastrami relationship."  
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of relationship?"  
</P>
<P>
 "A pastrami relationship -- based on late-night performance post-mortems and 
delicatessen. We'd go out and get sandwiches and bring them back to Victoria's 
hotel suite and -- pastrami, you see, is -- " 
</P>
<P>
 "Pastrami is wonderful," Victoria declared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who was it, Victoria," I asked, "who first introduced you to pastrami? It 
wasn't any of us; it must have been (impresario Sol) Hurok." 
</P>
<P>
 "But what is this pastrami?" the functionary persisted. "Where does the name 
come from?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows where the name comes from, but Jewish people -- and by extension 
musical and theatrical New Yorkers -- get very nostalgic around it. I had a 
friend who always joked, 'Goldie, was that before or after Papa invented 
pastrami?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "That's very good," Victoria said, laughing. "That reminds me of my father. If 
you were talking about him, you might say something like that, and people would 
not question you. This makes me very nostalgic: makes me think of the world 
before so many changes. What was it we used to say at the end of the Met 
season, when we were all saying goodby?" 
</P>
<P>
 "See ya later, alligator." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, and then, 'After a while, crocodile!' Good thing we don't say that 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "You should worry. It's us who are turning into old reptiles. Like the kids 
said tonight when you were working on the Faust, it looks like you made your 
own pact with the devil." 
</P>
<P>
 (At Victoria's Alice Tully Hall performance in March, I'd heard two veteran 
concert-goers -- echt yentas -- stage-whispering behind me, between encores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very gratified you gave into your impulse and got these tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I hadn't heard her in over 20 years -- and it is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 "The voice!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there is the voice -- but I was down in front at the break with 
the photographer taking pictures, and I can assure you there is not a line on 
that face!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it is very gratifying, longevity; it is.")  
</P>
<P>
 VICTORIA DE LOS ANGELES LoPEZ Y GARCiA (BORN IN BARCELONA ON NOV. 1, 1923, TO 
victoria Garcia and Bernardo Lopez, the caretaker of the University of 
Barcelona) was given her mother's name coupled with that of her maternal uncle, 
Angel Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a big discussion about this name. There are for girls the names 
Victoria and Angeles, but they had never been put together to form Victoria de 
los Angeles, which the priest let my father know. Well, this is the first one, 
he said. My father was a man used to getting what he wanted. He provided for us 
very well -- we lived in the tower of the chemistry faculty of the university 
-- particularly when times became so hard, and he was very greatly respected by 
students of all the faculties, who would come back to see him more than their 
professors." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was what they call here a factotum."  
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly. And do you know who he took as model? Tom Mix. 'Ah, los Americanos 
!' he would cry out in the cinema. I couldn't wait to come (to America). Our 
kitchen in the tower was the center of every kind of political and cultural 
discussion until the (Spanish) civil war broke out. Then we went down into the 
underground -- the subway stations -- and kept talking, and I was by then 
singing, to cheer people up a little -- and myself also -- while the bombs fell 
on the city. I sang in Red Cross concerts and during the raids, underground. I 
do not like to go into the subway today." 
</P>
<P>
 "But you did take it to the Met, from 57th Street -- when you were late for 
rehearsal." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very sleepy in the morning still."  
</P>
<P>
 "When did you start to sing?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I always sang -- imitating my mother, who had a lot of success in amateur 
zarzuela (a peculiarly Spanish form of operetta). And I would strum my Uncle 
Angel's guitar and go va-va-va-va. But also, in the progressive Mila y 
Fontanals school -- a kind of Montessori school -- I was skipping pottery 
making and recess and all that, to look at the music for ' Ah, vous dirai-je 
maman ' (to the tune of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"). I knew the melody in 
advance, of course, and matching it with these notes, I made a third new thing 
-- voila -- which fascinated me so much, because it was between the abstract 
and the real, and I decided to make every song I liked my own in this way . . . 
and very soon the notes became the key to the songs I did not already know the 
melodies of. I was very serious." 
</P>
<P>
 "And the opera?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Opera was not part of the entertainment of working-class people the way it is 
in Italy. My introduction to it was very strange and occurred in that time you 
have referred to, when our world was turned upside down. I will tell you two 
stories. This was a terrible time. I remember so well that I had a big crush on 
a boy called Ferrer, a student who lived with his family just on the other side 
of the university wall. He was a few years older -- and this was, you 
understand, completely one-sided. Well, he went out in the street one day and 
was shot, and they carried him into my mother's kitchen, and I can still see 
him there as he died. I know this is the kind of thing that happens in this 
city every day, but back then it did not happen." 
</P>
<P>
 "That can sound suspiciously like the Myth of the Golden Age." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, but those things did not -- and now they do. It is as if the more 
politics meant to find solutions, the more -- " 
</P>
<P>
 "Like the Catalan proverb of the cat and the mice." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, you like that? The more cats we get, still the more mice we have." 
</P>
<P>
 "And the longer you're going to have to keep singing for peace. And the second 
story?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. It was after the boy died. One day my brother Pepe and I came upon a 
pile left over from the looting by the Reds -- the things they didn't want from 
the rich people's houses -- and in there were recordings by Caruso and 
Tetrazzini. I took the Tetrazzini records, and my father went out and found a 
machine, because until then we made our own music at home, with Uncle Angel's 
guitar, and the first opera sounds I heard were Tetrazzini singing 'Je Suis 
Titania' (from Ambroise Thomas' "Mignon"). I started to listen -- I was I think 
about 13 -- and right away I began to love the Italian vowels." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the story -- exclusive of the downside -- can be read in outline 
on any program of a Victoria de los Angeles recital or on the back on any of 
her records. The conservatory where she charged through a six-year course in 
exactly half that time, winning every prize. The debut at age 20 at the Liceo 
as the Countess in Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro." Her jury-unanimous first 
prize at the 1947 Geneva Competition, her "discovery" on a BBC broadcast soon 
after, singing Salud in Falla's "La Vida Breve," and what the British like to 
refer to as her "hat trick" -- three debuts within the space of a little over a 
year at La Scala (singing the Milan premiere of Richard Strauss' "Ariadne auf 
Naxos"), Covent Garden (Mimi in "La Boheme," the role she came to virtually own 
in the '50s and which she recorded with Jussi Bjorling in what is still the 
best-selling opera recording of all time) and, on March 17, 1951, at New York's 
Metropolitan (as Marguerite in "Faust"), on which occasion preeminent music 
critic, the often acerbic Virgil Thomson, wrote the essential De los Angeles 
evaluation, one that has stood for 43 years: 
</P>
<P>
 "She projected the text as clearly as she did the musical line, and she acted 
the role with a delicate intensity all unusual to that stage. . . . Her 
vocalism, beautifully schooled, and in every way secure, was marked by a 
similar concentration on excellence and an abstention from broad effects. . . . 
She does not sing off pitch, or tremble, or make ugly sounds, or lack precision 
in scale passages. . . . I think she has the makings of a great star -- voice, 
schooling, musicianship, sincerity and a stage personality that is strong and 
warm."  
</P>
<P>
 VICTORIA DE LOS ANGELES SANG AT THE METROPOLITAN OPERA FOR 10 SEASONS until 
1961, when circumstances at the Met, along with happy and unhappy events at 
home (the birth of two children, Juan Enrique in 1963 and Alejandro -- born 
with Down's syndrome -- in 1968) began to restrict her appearances to recitals, 
in which metier she had already succeeded to a degree far surpassing all but a 
small handful of opera singers in this century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you actually tire of Italian opera or did you hear danger signals early?" 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Both. I was always determined to sing opera musically, with the same 
technique as in recital, only with more sound, of course. And to learn about 
theatricality myself -- not hard to do, after all, in a city like Barcelona. 
You only have to look around. And remember, I began with Mozart, with the 
Countess, and keeping my eye, for when I got older, on Donna Anna. Of course, I 
was naive at first. What did I know about betrayal and possessiveness and 
cruelty at 20? That is to say, on a personal level -- from people who are 
supposed to be on your side, so to speak. About all that in politics, I knew 
already very well from the civil war. So I expressed the music, according to 
the rules -- because the rules are very exact, and it's no use imagining you 
can learn them and then say, 'Well, I put them away and do as I like.' I began 
to learn from the rules, and of course, within 15 years or so, I found out that 
what Mozart and Da Ponte were writing of, treachery, was absolutely true." 
</P>
<P>
 "The hard way," I said. The capricious general manager of the Met, Sir Rudolf 
Bing, at first her champion, became entirely neglectful toward her, exploiting 
her drawing power by casting her in a series of popular roles that increased 
the Met's box office but that no longer suited her voice.  
</P>
<P>
 "Claro -- the only way. Also the conflict. The Countess is all-forgiving, and 
Donna Anna is not so. Although Donna Anna is like that woman in that Bette 
Davis picture I love -- what is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you mean 'The Letter.' 'With all my heart I still love the man I 
killed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "That's it. Ah, she was something, Bette Davis! The best ever. Everybody in 
every language understands her. But in the meantime, besides Mozart and the 
French composers, I had sung a lot of verismo and a lot of Verdi, truly loving 
both. But to sing those roles, you must always spill a little Chianti, you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 I said I thought I did. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right," she said. "So, in Italian opera, you have the glass of Chianti." 
She puts down the pastrami sandwich and takes up the glass, which is half full 
of Coca-Cola. "Then you must do this -- swirl it around, faster and faster, 
until a little of the Chianti spills over. This is Italian opera. How much you 
are willing -- or able -- to spill is what marks you as the temperament you 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a little like the famous injunction, 'Always sing on your vocal 
interest, never on your vocal capital'?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a little different, because that injunction is particularly significant 
for singing Wagner. But it is similar to the Chianti. Anyway, I suppose, not 
actually being Italian, and preferring in many instances French music -- and 
particularly in order to keep singing Faure and Duparc as well as Schubert and 
Schumann -- I was led away from opera -- and anyway, I was 40. Even so, I took 
my time. I was 56 when I last sang an operatic role." (Melisande in "Pelleas 
and Melisande," in Madrid, 1980.) 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I was around 40, I'd been married for 15 years (to her manager, 
Enrique Magrina), I was having the children and all that, and it was the songs, 
mostly settings of quite superior poetry, that had the most to teach me. After 
we found out about Alejandro, then I realized that never again was I going to 
be anything else but a fighter. Because, you know, this is not a tragedy, 
having one of these children. It is absolutely incorrect to me, this term for 
that. These children give you the opportunity to discover what is essential in 
human life. That is not what you sing about, for the most part, in opera -- 
what is essential, what is the necessity."  
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to sum up the predicament -- and every career worth talking about is 
a predicament -- I would say that the voice mirrors your nature exactly," I 
said. "You are reclusive, but you are very far from being a recluse. But 
getting back to the curtailment of the voice, and the drawing away from opera, 
it wasn't just the birth of Alejandro." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it wasn't," she replied. "For many years I had the voice and the career 
-- it was very pleasant, particularly in that Metropolitan company. Such stars 
-- so many! Four, five, six different singers in a single major role in a 
season -- and all of them first class. You can't imagine!" 
</P>
<P>
 "But I was there, instead of doing my homework."  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember. Well, it was, what do they say -- too much. And then one morning, 
you wake up to find that instead of giving you everything because you are -- 
what? Entertaining?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Life enhancing is the way I would put it -- and for many among us, life 
sustaining." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, in any case, you wake up to find out they are trying to take it all 
away -- personally, professionally, all at once. You either fight or you die. 
I've been fighting."  
</P>
<P>
 "I know," I said, recalling the Metropolitan Opera ordeals. "Remember the 
night, back in the '80s, I said I was going to have to start calling you Rocky? 
Thank God you laughed, broke out into those peals of laughter -- very 
Marguerite, in 'The Jewel Song' (from "Faust). "  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, and you were holding up the mirror. You have always made me laugh -- you 
are New York to me in that." 
</P>
<P>
 "But you are a temperament. I long ago defined stardom in my own mind, 
deciding it was always the product of a temperament in collision with a 
tradition. You are a temperament, if not a spitfire. Your relationship to music 
is more like the tango than the boxing ring." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you must give in to the music most of the time. But you must not lie 
down and be passive. The young singer must be defended against the ingenuity of 
stage directors. I remember you telling me about the effect in 'Un Bel Di' 
(from 'Madame Butterfly') -- "  
</P>
<P>
 "Turning a back projection into the atomic bomb."  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes -- that is very interesting, and you see, from the singer's point of 
view, only a little disconcerting: It would effect the aria very well, because 
it is a static patch that. But, for instance, when you tell me they are 
sometimes portraying Mimi now as a -- " 
</P>
<P>
 "Slut." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, a slut. Well, that, if you are a lyric soprano, could be dangerous. Mimi 
may be deluded in the romantic way, but I think it is better to leave her 
alone, and let Musetta be a little . . . common , and also warm and generous. 
But you must remember, I first sang Mimi when I was myself 17, and I recorded 
it with Jussi Bjorling -- and opposite a voice like that, the most beautiful 
tenor voice there ever was, you are only going to be an enraptured girl. In any 
case, they weren't (portraying Mimi as a slut) in the '50s -- and if they are 
doing it today, I say only 'be careful.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Could we now cut to the chase?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What is that thing -- what does it mean, cut to -- what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The chase. The end of the picture. Have you kept many souvenirs?"  
</P>
<P>
 "My husband kept it all in his office -- and when he died 10 years ago it all 
went into boxes. I never look at it. I have my prizes of course, in another 
room in the house -- and a baton somebody made for me, with a different color 
ribbon for each of the roles I sang in the opera; it's my favorite prize." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't throw things away, then." 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I did -- and now I regret it. It was after my mother died. I threw away 
all the letters I wrote to her from my early career, from all over the world -- 
my impressions of cities, of countries, of people. I wish I had not done that." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you did the right thing. You had to alight after your mother's death 
and all the other troubles, and destroying the letters probably helped you. 
Have you seen the old man in your dream again? The one I said was King Arkel, 
from 'Pelleas'?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, yes. And this time I did not ask him where do I go. Or what is going to 
happen." She seems to gaze out over the Atlantic.  
</P>
<P>
 "But didn't he tell you that he does not answer questions?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, but I am very persistent -- like my father; I do not jump up on the 
table, true, but I am very persistent, and I asked him, 'Please, can you tell 
me, what is the nature of affection?' "

FILM CLIPS / BOOK FAIR FRENZY: NO PUBLISHER WANTS TO GET BEATEN TO 'PULP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The book world has rarely seen anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hottest properties at last month's Frankfurt (Germany) Book Fair 
was not the latest novel from Stephen King or Norman Mailer, or the newest 
academic tome by Harold Bloom -- but the screenplay of Quentin Tarantino's 
"Pulp Fiction." And this, before the film has even hit European screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents who visited the annual fair say that interest in the screenplay -- not 
a novelization -- eclipsed bidding on most other works presented there. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my 17 years at the agency, I have never seen the interest level so strong 
on any one work," says Robert Gottlieb, head of William Morris' literary 
division and one of Tarantino's representatives. "We go to Frankfurt with a hot 
list of maybe a dozen books and every 15 minutes to half an hour we meet with a 
publisher from a different country about buying them. Well this year, it was 
amazing. The first question every one of them asked was if 'Pulp Fiction,' the 
screenplay, was available for publication and translation." 
</P>
<P>
 While Tarantino's agents won't disclose what amount the screenplay was 
ultimately sold for, they claim that he's receiving a novel rate -- which is 
generally much higher than that for a screenplay -- and that he retains 
approval rights on all translations. At this point there are no plans for a 
novelization. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer countries for the fair included Japan, Germany, France, Italy, 
Spain, Holland, Canada, England and Australia. Marcy Posner, William Morris' 
director of foreign rights, expects France and Germany to publish within a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "To give you an idea of the interest," Posner says, "I barely sell anything in 
Greece -- they've even asked for it . Quentin's strong international reputation 
as a screenwriter and filmmaker is what caused all of the interest." 
</P>
<P>
 In a few weeks, Hyperion Publishing expects to have the U.S. version available 
in major book chains, including Barnes & Noble and Waldenbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll start out with about 25,000 copies," says Miramax's senior vice 
president of communications Donna Daniels, "but if this takes off like 'The 
Piano' as we expect, that should double." 
</P>
<P>
 Screenplay and novel versions of last year's "The Piano," Daniels says, sold 
more than 100,000 -- and 70,000 of those were the screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quentin Tarantino has become such a cult figure," Daniels says, "the 
curiosity is to see how he writes screenplays, not books."*

JUDY OVITZ, CALL YOUR AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Missing that special extra in your movie? Well, consider director Ivan 
Reitman's method: Look no further than your agent's significant other. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Ovitz, wife of CAA chairman Michael Ovitz, will soon be seen in a bit 
part in Reitman's offbeat comedy, "Junior." 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito play scientists; Judy 
Ovitz plays a flight attendant in a brief scene. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ovitz said that his wife would have no comment, both he and Reitman 
insist he had nothing to do with her getting the role. Judy Ovitz, a family 
friend of Reitman's, also appeared in Reitman's 1989 "Ghostbusters 2."  
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Reitman says he'll probably use her again. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's great fun. Besides, I like for people I know to have cameos in my 
films," he says. "I think this is the first film I haven't put my children in!"

COMMENTARY; AUTEUR OF AIMLESSNESS; LOCAL HERO JUSTIN TANNER TURNS HIS VISION ON 
THE ABSURDITIES OF AMERICAN LIFE WITH A PACE THAT RECALLS HAWKS AND A SWEETNESS 
THAT EVOKES MIKE LEIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Laurie Winer, Laurie Winer is The Times' theater critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What if Arthur Miller felt there was nothing shameful about being in the lower 
middle class and he had a sense of humor? And he was 30? Would he be Justin 
Tanner? 
</P>
<P>
 No, better let a young writer more concerned with morals, like Jon Robin 
Baitz, inherit the heavy mantle of the American Playwright. Tanner's scenarios 
are so slender, and his sense of a moral imperative so practically nonexistent, 
that compared to Miller or Baitz it might seem easy to dismiss his California 
stories as footnotes in American drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy perhaps, but very definitely wrong.  
</P>
<P>
 As should be apparent to any repeat visitor to the Cast Theatre's "Collected 
Plays of Justin Tanner" -- nine works written between 1989 and this year -- 
Tanner's plays are something altogether new. Although they may resemble sitcom 
or the clever if more upscale comedies of Paul Rudnick, they are clearly 
neither. Now comes the hard part. What are they? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer lies in Tanner's distinctive eye for the small absurdities of 
American life and the hairpin turns in human relations that occur without 
reason or happen too quickly to analyze. 
</P>
<P>
 He combines a radical disinclination to judge with a perfect ear for the 
dialogue of characters who are drifting along, leading lives either too 
unimportant for most dramatists to take notice of, or impotent enough for 
others to use as fodder for set pieces on American aimlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his best plays, "Bitter Women" (1993), chronicles the adventures of 
Nancy (Lauren Wylie), a young woman living on her own for the first time in a 
low-rent apartment in Silver Lake (where Tanner also resides). 
</P>
<P>
 Shy and hopelessly inexperienced, Nancy seems completely unequipped to deal 
with the simple things life will throw her, like the landlady from hell (played 
by the Cast's artistic director Diana Gibson) who diverges suddenly from 
inconsequential friendly chatter to give Nancy the "spiel" -- a list of hard 
and fast rules that ends with something like ". . . and if you don't pay the 
rent on time, I will sue you. And if you think I'm Mom, well, you'll find out 
I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the roommate, also from hell, played by Tanner's muse, Laurel 
Green, the only actor to appear in all nine plays. Her Kim is a silky-voiced, 
duplicitous aerobics instructor who insists on color-coding the toilet paper to 
keep clear whose turn it is to buy it, and who presents her meek roommate with 
that dreaded instrument of pre-independence, the chore wheel. Worse, Kim 
pretends to care about Nancy's problems while sleeping with the one guy Nancy 
covets. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors are a bit more decent: Mona (Thea Constantine) offers to help 
Nancy out of a jam with the money she makes from a relatively lucrative 
phone-sex business. But when Nancy can't pay it back on time, she finds she 
might as well have borrowed from Don Corleone. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mona walks around in cheap lingerie with a cordless phone at all 
times, Nancy is as oblivious to the nature of Mona's business as she is to 
everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 But she does adjust, and even triumphs, and she finds a true pal in Angela the 
pizza delivery girl (played by Tanner regular Dana Schwartz, who has the 
doleful, big-eyed stare of British film comedienne Eleanor Bron). After much 
common betrayal and everyday mayhem, here's the big finale: Nancy and Angela 
get a double date with a couple of cute guys to ride the Ferris wheel at Santa 
Monica pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner keeps scenarios such as this one vivid and interesting by making 
whatever oddball thing is at stake as heart-rending as it would be to the 
innocent living through it. As an auteur (Tanner directs his plays as well) he 
most resembles the British film director Mike Leigh, whose loving portraits of 
the eccentric lower middle class lit up "Life Is Sweet" and "High Hopes." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner portraits are loving but never sentimental. His characters lie, 
wheedle, blame, betray, are tremendously insincere and consume drugs with all 
the guilt of a group of 17-year-old Dead Heads. Yet they are endearing. They 
are capable of totally unexpected and unnecessary acts of tenderness. And in 
the snap-crackle pace of dialogue, as fast and smart as in a Howard Hawks 
comedy, Tanner gives you reams of information that neither he nor the 
characters have any interest in dwelling on. His throw-away lines constitute 
what other playwrights will structure an entire scene around. 
</P>
<P>
 And most refreshing of all, Tanner seems entirely uninterested in using his 
characters to make any larger points whatsoever. Recreational drug use is not 
evidence of empty or empty-headed lives, but an ingenious dramatic device to 
form immediate intimacies and to accelerate already established relationships. 
And as it sometimes does in real life, but then only to the participants, drugs 
make things funnier. 
</P>
<P>
 'P ot Mom" features a friend ship between two women based almost entirely on 
the blanket of comfort and fun that marijuana can bring to people who hate 
their jobs. The American family that Tanner portrays in this 1994 play would 
give Dan Quayle a coronary. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard (Jon Palmer), the truck driver who is not married to Patty (Ellen 
Ratner), hates Patty's grown kids because they constantly steal his pot. The 
kids would like nothing better than to get rid of Richard and his creepy dog, 
Skipper. Lisa (Green), the bratty daughter, likes to parade in front of Richard 
in a towel just to unnerve him. There is no dark Oprah-guest slant to all this, 
just teen-age malice. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty and her best friend, Michelle (Elizabeth Ruscio), love to watch "I Love 
Lucy" while blissfully passing the bong, and Tanner throws in a situation 
tailor-made for the art form that Lucy helped pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine (Schwartz), Patty's studious daughter, dreams of joining Corral de 
Tierra, a club for girls from better families. To Lorraine, it would mean the 
world if she could join and "play tennis with the shoes with the little balls 
on them," but first she needs to be approved, and that means her family will 
have to air out the house and act normal for the visit from a two-girl 
acceptance committee. 
</P>
<P>
 True to form, the acceptance rite is a disaster, though not because the family 
doesn't rally. The household will experience one more huge upheaval, a 
brilliantly funny one, before the end of the play, which says that a mom and 
her two daughters can face the uncertain and probably bleak future with hope if 
they can huddle together in front of "I Love Lucy" with a stolen joint. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner plays Troy, Patty's sarcastic son who works at the Northridge triplex. 
When Troy says, "Yes, I'm an usher but you know I want to direct," he's not 
actually exhibiting ambition. He's merely reveling in the fact that he has a 
gift for parody and, if he chooses, can do absolutely nothing with it.

 Tanner's earlier plays, such as the 1989 "Still Life With Vacuum Salesman" 
(formerly, "Barbie and Ken at Home" -- before Mattel objected) shows him 
slightly more willing to make points about his characters as well as some of 
the people who slammed the playwright's head against the lockers at North 
Salinas High. On the eve of their 10th high school reunion, Barbie (Green) and 
Ken (Mark Ruffalo) are no longer the prom queen and king. He is now an 
oil-stained mechanic pathetically attached to his high-school wrestling 
trophies; she works the graveyard shift at a local donut shop. Their fights are 
really nasty, and their apartment is by far the worst in the entire Tanner 
canon. Bags of trash and cast-off syrofoam cups litter the living room and an 
extra large Diet Pepsi bottle stands in for a table leg. 
</P>
<P>
 As dark as this play is, "Still Life" overflows with the piquant details that 
make every Tanner play buoyant. After discovering, from the back of the Ritz 
Cracker box, that "you can bake an apple pie without any apples!" Barbie 
gleefully sets to work, sans meat, on some Ritz burgers for Ken. As she spoons 
out the glop for her horrified husband, Tanner goes Roseanne one step better 
for summing up everything that is depressing and hilarious about white-trash 
America. And he does it without condescension, and with infinite amusement. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner maintains empathy for his characters' aimlessness while somehow finding 
the ambition to make art out of it. What Hollywood might do with him, or TV, or 
even stages larger and wealthier than the charming, dog-eared Cast, I couldn't 
say. In a way, I don't want to know. "The Collected Plays of Justin Tanner" is 
something perfect just as it is.*

A MATTER OF DEFECTION; JORGE ESQUIVEL, ONCE CUBA'S LEADING MALE DANCER, WAS 
HAILED FOR HIS SENSITIVITY AND VIRTUOSITY. TODAY AT 44, HE TEACHES AT THE SAN 
FRANCISCO BALLET AND DANCES CHARACTER ROLES. BUT HE SAYS HE DOESN'T REGRET THE 
CHANGES IN HIS CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Martin Bernheimer, Martin Bernheimer is The Times' music and dance critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jorge Esquivel should have been an international superstar. Balletomanes 
everywhere should have thought of him when they thought of Rudolf Nureyev and 
Mikhail Baryshnikov. 
</P>
<P>
 Extraordinarily lithe, eminently Latin and macho-muscular, he exuded what the 
hypesters like to call animal magnetism. He was a firebrand, in the best sense. 
But he also was a cavalier, a disciplined stylist and the most self-effacing, 
most considerate, most reliable partner a ballerina could dream of. 
</P>
<P>
 He had the touch of a poet. Even better, he had the touch of a tall poet. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Nureyev and Baryshnikov, Esquivel came from a Communist country. 
Unfortunately for him, perhaps, it wasn't the country of the glamorous Kirov 
and Bolshoi. 
</P>
<P>
 Esquivel was, in more than one sense, a product of Fidel Castro's Cuba. As 
such, he also was the protege and, for most impractical purposes, the property 
of Alicia Alonso, the legendary dancer who created a world-class company in her 
own image with the total support of the Castro regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1950, Esquivel was chosen for glory while still a boy. Carefully 
trained, studiously nurtured and painstakingly groomed, he rose from a modest 
background to become the premier danseur of the Ballet Nacional de Cuba and, as 
such, the primary partner of its aging, nearly blind, eternally compelling 
prima ballerina assoluta.  
</P>
<P>
 He was, from 1972 to 1986, the leading male dancer in Cuba. That virtually 
made him the leading male dancer in Latin America. He earned spectacular 
triumphs wherever the Cuban ballet was allowed to tour, even, as the iron 
curtains eventually began to open, in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his repertory was confined to the Havana repertory, and his 
opportunities for professional expansion remained slim. A Cuban dancer -- by 
political, social and artistic definition -- could not be an independent 
dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, after 18 years with the National Ballet, he decided to abandon both 
his alma maters -- partner and company. After a brief sojourn with a lesser 
Cuban ensemble (this one run by Fernando Alonso, Alicia's former husband), he 
made the big break. While visiting Italy, he went to the U.S. consulate to 
request asylum. The erstwhile role model for Cuban youth opted for a precarious 
new life and a difficult new occupation in the dangerous world of capitalism. 
Now 44, he resides in San Francisco and works quietly for the San Francisco 
Ballet, which he first joined in January, 1993. When he isn't teaching classes, 
he performs character roles. The noble Siegfried has become the evil Rothbart. 
</P>
<P>
 When Helgi Tomasson's San Franciscans bring "Romeo and Juliet" south to the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion from Nov. 30 to Dec. 4, Esquivel will appear as the 
menacing Tybalt. In his prime, he could have been an ideal Romeo. Sadly, those 
days are over. 
</P>
<P>
 Esquivel may harbor regrets about the limitations and detours of his career, 
but he refuses to admit them. During a conversation in the lavish offices of 
the San Francisco Ballet, he remains steadfastly philosophical about the past 
and bravely optimistic about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 He answers questions with humor and self-deprecating candor, sometimes in 
halting English and sometimes in the rapidly tumbling sentences of 
Cuban-flavored Spanish. Antonio Castilla, a principal dancer from Madrid and 
fellow teacher, generously volunteers to serve as interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow Esquivel isn't prepared for the inevitable first question: Why did he 
leave the National Ballet of Cuba? 
</P>
<P>
 " Bueno ," he pauses. "Why? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he does know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been there so many years. I needed to be free, and I was tired. For 
seven months I didn't dance at all. Then I wanted to do more, to do different 
things. I knew that I didn't have much time." 
</P>
<P>
 He made a lot of guest appearances -- in Buenos Aires, in Perm, in Brazil, in 
Italy. He danced with diverse divas -- Ghislaine Thesmar, Eva Evdokimova, 
Cynthia Gregory and Carla Fracci (all, incidentally, older women, but none as 
old as Alicia Alonso, who was born in 1921). 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, he had turned down an offer from Lucia Chase to join American 
Ballet Theatre years earlier. "I was not ready then," he explains. "I had a 
wife and young daughter. I felt I could not leave the country and the company 
that had given me everything. It would have caused too much pain." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges basic, ultimately fragile loyalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not have been anybody without Alicia and without the revolution. I 
knew that, and I knew what ballet meant to everyone in my country. It was not 
the time to think of leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, the declining political and economic fortunes of Cuba have 
taken a drastic toll on the National Ballet. Esquivel's marriage has been 
dissolved, and his daughter is virtually an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now everything is different," he says. "My daughter is 18. I haven't seen her 
for two years, but it isn't so bad. We can talk on the phone, and I know the 
situation in Cuba will change." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, he is not here with his country's blessings, or with those of 
Alicia Alonso. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have many relatives in Cuba -- brothers, sisters, uncles . . . I'd 
love to see them," he adds. "But if I were to go back, the people in charge 
would cut my head off." 
</P>
<P>
 He laughs. Nervously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have decorations from Castro and from the ministry of culture. They must 
regard me as a traitor. My decision to leave was motivated by artistic, not 
political, reasons, but that wouldn't make any difference." 
</P>
<P>
 And Alicia Alonso? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's even worse. She would not speak to me. In her eyes, I now am a dead 
person. She thinks I have betrayed a trust, betrayed her, betrayed the company 
and the country too. There's no way she can understand. It makes me sad. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is like a sick mother. She gave me life, in a sense, and she thinks I 
belong to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the same with Castro. The revolution was great, but the world is 
changing. Some people cannot comprehend the change." 
</P>
<P>
 It could not have been easy to dance with a partner who was 29 years older and 
afflicted with severe vision problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult in the beginning," Esquivel admits, "but I got used to it. I 
danced with Alicia for 14 years. That is longer than any other partner she had. 
(Igor) Youskevich danced with her for only 10 years. She was a genius. There is 
no question of that. I knew the difference when I danced with other ballerinas 
in the company." 
</P>
<P>
 He becomes agitated when asked about current conditions in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ballet Nacional was one of the best companies in the world, and it can 
still produce wonderful dancers. The men are especially good. Castro wanted the 
men to symbolize everything proud and noble in Cuba. When boys were chosen for 
the school, they could not be weak. They had to represent the country, Castro, 
the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "But these are bad times. The government needs money. Many have left." 
</P>
<P>
 He claims that he feels no disappointment regarding his new career. "I did not 
come here with great expectations," he says. "It was too late for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Was it difficult to give up his heroic roles? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he declares, almost defiantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't he miss Siegfried and Albrecht and all those lofty princes? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. But one has to know oneself. One has to know what one can do. Destiny 
has made me Tebaldo (Tybalt) now, and I will be the best Tebaldo I can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must give 100%. For me there never has been another way." 
</P>
<P>
 Esquivel doesn't pretend that the downward switch in repertory poses no 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one doesn't understand the situation," he admits in matter-of-fact tones, 
"the pain can be great." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he finds comfort in San Francisco. "In Cuba I didn't just dance in 
wonderful theaters. I also danced in rice fields, in bull rings and on floating 
stages. Now I am here. It is a new life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is so beautiful. The company is one of the best. Helgi has been very 
generous. I love teaching. I cannot complain about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Complaining, in any case, would not seem to be Esquivel's forte. Modesty is 
his forte. 
</P>
<P>
 He brushes aside any suggestion that he didn't fulfill his potential as a 
universal celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is fame?" he shrugs. "I had more fame than I deserved." 
</P>
<P>
 One hopes he doesn't protest too much.*

TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING?; THIS YEAR'S ROCK HALL OF FAME BALLOT BOASTS A STRONG 
LINEUP, FROM ALLMANS TO ZEP, BUT IT MAY MEAN SOME WORTHY ARTISTS GET PASSED 
OVER AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Hilburn, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic and a member 
of the Rock Hall of Fame's nominating committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a logjam at the entrance to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in the foundation's 10-year history, there are more 
deserving artists -- including Led Zeppelin, Janis Joplin and Neil Young -- on 
the Hall of Fame ballot than can be inducted under the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, that's good news. The hall's voting process has often been 
criticized for turning to secondary artists -- such as the Four Seasons and the 
Platters -- to fill the annual quota of seven. Why? The more stars at the 
induction banquet the better. 
</P>
<P>
 But the flood of candidates this time presents its own hazard. If the 600 
voting record executives, musicians and critics skipped over such landmark acts 
as Joni Mitchell and the Velvet Underground last year when the competition was 
less intense, they could very well look past these essential artists again. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 15 names on this year's ballots, 10 made the kind of invaluable 
contributions to the evolution of rock that merit Hall of Fame recognition. But 
the difference between those 10 acts -- in terms of artistic excellence, 
chiefly, but also influence and longevity -- is sometimes substantial. 
</P>
<P>
 Under hall rules, artists become eligible 25 years after the release of their 
first record, so artists who began their careers in 1969 are now eligible. The 
seven winners are expected to be announced shortly with induction ceremonies 
scheduled for Jan. 12 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a personal ranking of the nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Neil Young -- Three Top 40 singles as a solo artist, including 1972's 
"Heart of Gold," plus 19 Top 40 solo albums stretching from 1969's "Everybody 
Knows This Is Nowhere" to the current "Sleeps With Angels." First year of 
eligibility as a solo artist.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Young is a restless, independent spirit who fearlessly follows his most 
radical instincts, whether it leads him to moments of delicate introspection or 
unrelenting sonic assault. He has been cited by today's young alternative 
rockers -- from Sonic Youth to Pearl Jam -- as more of an influence than Bob 
Dylan. Young's recent "Sleeps With Angels" is an album of the year contender. 
Who else in rock has shown that kind of creative vitality after 25 years? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2. Joni Mitchell -- Four Top 40 singles, including "Help Me" and "Big Yellow 
Taxi" in 1974, plus 12 Top 40 albums, including 1971's "Blue" and 1974's "Court 
and Spark." Second year of eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the Hall of Fame judges to induct Mitchell during her first 
year of eligibility in 1993 was as big an embarrassment as overlooking Bob 
Marley a few years back. Hailed as an influence by artists as diverse as Prince 
and alternative rock hero Paul Westerberg, Mitchell -- whose new "Turbulent 
Indigo" album is one of the year's strongest works -- is a unique voice of the 
modern pop era. She is a master of musical textures who rivals Dylan for 
literary sensibility and the ability to examine relationships with an 
uncompromising eye. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3. Led Zeppelin -- Six Top 40 singles, including 1969's "Whole Lotta Love" and 
1971's "Black Dog," plus 11 Top 40 albums, including eight Top 5 sellers in a 
row between 1969's "Led Zeppelin II" and 1979's "In Through the Out Door." 
First year of eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This British band was beaten up by critics because its songs lacked the 
revelation or craft, lyrically, that you expect of a world-class group. But 
there's no denying the quartet's influence on everyone from Jane's Addiction to 
Soundgarden. Zeppelin's legacy is its focus on the sheer exhilaration of music; 
its aggression and assault are all the more striking because of occasional 
moments of tenderness and beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 4. Janis Joplin -- Just one Top 40 single -- 1971's "Me and Bobby McGee" -- 
and four Top 40 albums as a solo artist, but she had another Top 40 single -- 
1968's "Piece of My Heart" -- and a Top 40 album as a member of Big Brother & 
the Holding Company. First year of eligibility as a solo artist.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joplin, who died of a heroin overdose in 1970 at the age of 27, may have been 
the most undisciplined artist ever to achieve superstar status in rock. Despite 
neither the vocal purity of Chrissie Hynde nor the revolutionary songwriting 
vision of Patti Smith, Joplin still stands as rock's most captivating female 
performer. The blues-rocker's weapon was pure passion. She sang with such 
intensity and abandon that you felt as if she was giving you a piece of her 
heart every time she stepped on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 5. Velvet Underground -- No Top 40 singles or Top 100 albums until "VU," a 
collection of previously unreleased material, broke into the album charts in 
1985, more than a dozen years after the band called it quits. Fourth year of 
eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You might be able to forgive the Hall of Fame voters for passing over this 
group once, but it's a disgrace when it happens three times. One reason may be 
that the Velvets never had a Top 40 hit. Another is the voters may be waiting 
to honor Lou Reed, the group's key member, when he becomes eligible as a solo 
artist in 1997. That's faulty thinking. Hall of Fame membership should be based 
on creative contribution, not sales -- and the influence of the Velvets' 
studies in social realism on '80s and '90s bands stands independent of Reed's 
later works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 6. Al Green -- Fourteen Top 40 singles, from 1971's "Tired of Being Alone" 
through 1988's duet with Annie Lennox on "Put a Little Love in Your Heart," and 
eight Top 40 albums, notably 1972's "Let's Stay Together" and "I'm Still in 
Love With You." First year of eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a superb singer and performer who rates with Hall of Fame members Ray 
Charles, Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding as one of the all-time 
great soul artists. His streak of '70s hits with producer Willie Mitchell at Hi 
Records in Memphis had some of the most consistently soulful music ever 
recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 7. Parliament-Funkadelic -- Parliament and Funkadelic, collectively, have 
registered three Top 40 singles -- including Parliament's 1976 "Tear the Roof 
Off the Sucker" and Funkadelic's 1978 "One Nation Under a Groove" -- and eight 
Top 40 albums . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Velvet Underground, the importance of George Clinton's funk empire 
may rest as much in its influence as in its actual recordings. Not only did the 
free-form excursions into R&B, blues and jazz inspire everyone from Prince to 
the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but they provided an invaluable foundation for much 
of the music and bravado in today's most commanding rap. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 8. The Allman Brothers Band -- Only three Top 40 singles, including 1973's 
"Ramblin' Man," but eight Top 40 albums, including 1972's "Eat a Peach" and 
1973's "Brothers and Sisters." First year of eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When most rock bands break into a five-minute instrumental passage, it's time 
to head to the rest room. When the Allman Brothers did it during the group's 
peak years, you were talking magic. Building its Southern blues-rock sound 
around the twin guitars of Duane Allman and Dickey Betts and the twin 
percussion of Butch Trucks and Jai Johnny Johnson, the Allmans were matched 
only by the Band for pure musical celebration. Of all the "what ifs" in rock, 
one of the most interesting is what they might have done if Duane Allman hadn't 
been killed in a 1971 motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 9. Frank Zappa -- Only one Top 40 single (1982's "Valley Girl," featuring 
daughter Moon Unit Zappa), but nine Top 40 albums, including 1968's "We're Only 
in It for the Money" and 1975's "One Size Fits All." Second year of eligibility 
as a solo artist.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zappa, who died last year, was a wonderfully subversive influence in pop -- 
someone whose refusal to accept the conventional limited his sales potential, 
but kept his music inventive and fresh. His work with the Mothers of Invention 
was as revolutionary as Dylan's words or Hendrix's guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 10. The Jackson 5 -- Eleven Top 10 singles, starting with "I Want You Back" in 
1969, plus 14 Top 40 albums, stretching from "Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 
5" in 1970 to "Victory" in 1984. Second year of eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a surprise to see the Jackson 5 passed over last year, but the voters 
must be looking to 1996 when Michael Jackson becomes eligible as a solo artist. 
With his brothers in the early '70s, however, Michael sang with such youthful 
yearning and self-affirmation that those records remain wonderfully disarming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 11. Buffalo Springfield -- One Top 40 single, 1967's "For What It's Worth," 
plus three Top 50 albums, including "Buffalo Springfield" and "Buffalo 
Springfield Again" (both 1967). Fourth year of eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which included Neil Young and Stephen Stills, qualifies for the 
Hall of Fame on the basis of creativity and influence, but longevity is a 
problem. Though the group signaled a generational change almost as vividly as 
such other Los Angeles bands as the Byrds and the Doors, it broke up after just 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 12. Jefferson Airplane -- Two Top 40 singles (1967's "Somebody to Love" and 
"White Rabbit") as the Airplane, plus 15 Top 40 singles in various Starship 
formations. Nine Top 40 Airplane albums. Fourth year of eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time in the '60s when the Airplane's psychedelic flight seemed as 
much at the center of the rock experience as Cream or the Doors, both of whom 
have been voted into the Hall of Fame. But the music's staying power was 
surprisingly short and none of the Starship efforts matter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 13. Little Willie John -- Four Top 40 pop singles, notably 1956's "Fever," and 
14 Top 20 R&B hits. Tenth year of eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A distinctive stylist whose career was sabotaged by personal problems, 
including a manslaughter conviction. He died in prison in 1968 at the age of 
30.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 14. The Shirelles -- Twelve Top 40 singles, including 1960's "Will You Love Me 
Tomorrow?" and "Dedicated to the One I Love," and one Top 40 album, a 1963 
greatest hits package. Tenth year of eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another case of a group that made a valuable contribution to a rock 'n' roll 
genre -- and outfits have made it into the Hall of Fame for less (the Four 
Seasons). But the Hall of Fame is still a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 15. Martha & the Vandellas -- Twelve Top 40 singles, including 1963's 
'Quicksand" and 1964's "Dancing in the Street," but no Top 20 albums. Seventh 
year of eligibility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some great records, but they operated in the shadow of all the other great 
Motown acts, where they still remain.*

MULTIPLE VOICES, MUSIC, SOUND EFFECTS, CD RECORDINGS AND EVEN FULL-CAST 
PRODUCTIONS.

 In a crisp, elegant voice, actor Edward Herrmann reads the first passages of 
the audio-book version of "Lost Moon," the story of the aborted Apollo 13 
mission to the moon. As he gets to a section about rumors that the astronauts 
carried suicide pills, he is interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget about it," says the cheery voice of Jim Lovell, the Apollo 13 
commander and the book's co-author. "There just weren't any situations where 
you'd ever consider making, well, an early exit." 
</P>
<P>
 Just who is in charge of reading this book, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is: both of them. This is an audio-book publisher's experiment with 
multiple voices, a rarity in an industry devoted almost exclusively to a 
single-reader format. And in the coming months, publishers will tinker even 
more with tradition: New titles will feature music, sound effects, CD 
recordings and even full-cast productions. 
</P>
<P>
 That is enough to make some audio-book purists buy earplugs. But some 
producers say more elaborate productions are the future of audio-books, as 
publishers jockey to distinguish their new releases and try to appeal to new 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 "By double digits, people are coming into the audio market, and they're 
bringing in more tastes," says Donald V. Allen, president of High-Top Sports 
Productions, an audio publisher in Hollywood. "Some people want more 
stimulation, more involvement in the product." 
</P>
<P>
 His firm's example: Richard Bak's "Ty Cobb: His Tumultuous Life and Times," a 
December release featuring the sounds of a baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one that lends itself," Allen says. "You have the roar of the crowd, 
the sound of the ball hitting the bat, the catcher talking to the umpire." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the industry is still dominated by simple productions, two audio-book 
hybrids recently made it to the Publishers Weekly bestseller list: "Star Wars: 
Dark Empire," a full-cast recording of a comic book, and "Neuromancer," a new 
audio production of William Gibson's cyber-novel that features unreleased mixes 
by rockers U2. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of the same technological campfire (as radio dramas)," says Maya 
Thomas, a producer at Time Warner AudioBooks, which released both bestsellers. 
"We're telling the tale and setting the mood." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lost Moon," just released by Simon & Schuster Audio, features the voices of 
Lovell and Herrmann, as well as the original recordings between Mission Control 
and the Apollo spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a medium you can play with," says Seth D. Gershel, publisher of Simon 
& Schuster Audio. "You don't just have to have someone sit down at the 
microphone and read. You can experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon & Schuster Audio originally planned for "Lost Moon" to be a traditional 
production. Lovell, who co-authored the book with Jeffrey Kluger, was to have 
read the six-hour abridgment on his own, but he had the same problem that many 
writers have behind a microphone: They aren't trained as narrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are astronauts, some people are publishers, some people are 
readers," Gershel says. "But we really wanted his voice on there. He really has 
a peaceful-sounding tone for a guy who sat up there in a tin can, wondering if 
he would come back or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Their solution was to split the duties. Herrmann, a veteran audio-book voice, 
narrates the bulk of the book, which is written in third person. Lovell voices 
more personal passages, such as the tense moments when he and the two other 
astronauts wonder how they will make it back to Earth. His passages were 
rewritten in first person for the audio production. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book really has a double focus," Herrmann says. "It shifts between what 
was happening at Mission Control in Houston and what was going on in the 
spacecraft. . . . This makes it more authentic, hearing it from (Lovell)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For other publishers, casting multiple voices is a simple way to discern the 
characters. Steven Weber ("Wings") voices much of "Dream Lovers," Dodd Darin's 
book about his parents, Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee. But Alison West takes over 
the reading when the book covers Dee's personal life and her troubles with an 
overprotective mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Gender isn't always the issue. In its upcoming release of James Patterson's 
"Kiss the Girls," Time Warner AudioBooks will feature different voices for a 
cop and two serial-killer villains. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes for a quicker identification and more variety," says John Wynne, 
another producer at Time Warner AudioBooks. In "Kiss the Girls," he says, the 
action "shifts suddenly to the killers' point of view as the cop is tracking 
them down. Having different voices heightens the suspense." 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner, in its attempt to reach new listeners, has been among the most 
aggressive in releasing audio-books with new twists. For example, in the audio 
version of his autobiography, Motown founder Berry Gordy sings a few chords of 
some of his record label's hits. Then the production features vintage 
recordings of the full singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some producers argue that listeners expect to hear music and sound effects, 
especially when the audio-book is an offshoot of some other form of media. 
Simon & Schuster's "Star Trek" novels feature the sounds of phasers and laser 
guns. Time Warner's "Star Wars" comic books include the popular score. Random 
House's "Baseball," the companion audio-book to the PBS series, features music 
from the documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the James Bond novels were first released, something was missing," says 
Gershel of Simon & Schuster. "It was the theme song at the beginning. The audio 
cried out for that. People expect to hear it because they saw the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet sound effects and music have a limit, Gershel says: 
</P>
<P>
 "People new to the business tend to overload. You want the story to just blend 
in the background. You're not going to take Barbara Bush's biography and juice 
it up with music. It doesn't need that." 
</P>
<P>
 Some audio publishers say that the more elaborate productions will only 
distract from the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like storytelling," said George Hodgkins, president of Audio Renaissance 
Tapes in Los Angeles. "If you characterize too much, it gets to be silly." 
</P>
<P>
 Technology could change the format. Producers are looking to 
three-dimensional, compact disc sound but so far have limited titles to ones 
popular to collectors, such as "Star Wars" and "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 But Herrmann argues that elaborate productions will turn off many fans. 
Commuters, who make up almost half of the audio-book market, listen to books to 
escape the cluttered world of radio talk and music shows, he says. "Tapes are 
an exercise in shutting the world out. They give you time to yourself. People 
listen to them because they aren't bombarded by images." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Gershel: "You want people to say, 'The story is terrific,' not 'This is a 
good tape.' "*

POPE URGES SICILIANS TO FIGHT MAFIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Wm. D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mafia dumped a lamb with its throat slit on the doorstep of a prison 
chaplain Saturday in a macabre, sneering challenge to visiting Pope John Paul 
II and the moral authority of the Roman Catholic Church in mob-racked Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll end up the same way," read a note left with the lamb at anti-Mafia 
priest Gino Sacchetti's home in Termini Imerese on the road between Catania and 
Palermo, the Sicilian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian television viewers learned of the slaughtered lamb -- a classic Mafia 
warning -- as John Paul tended his flock at a large outdoor Mass here where he 
urged Sicilians to confront adversity with "Christian courage" and blessed the 
memory of a Sicilian priest slain last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his fourth visit to the island where the Mafia was born, the 
74-year-old Pope repeatedly attacked organized crime, telling Sicilians they 
must demonstrate strength, action and unity to confront it. Silence, he warned, 
amounts to complicity. "Catania, rise up and cloak yourself in light and 
justice," he urged upon his arrival Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In a round of appearances on the second day of a three-day Sicilian visit, 
John Paul was strong-voiced and high-spirited. He used a cane but did not 
appear overly troubled by a sore right leg still mending after a break April 
29. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope told a crowd of enthusiastic young people at a soccer stadium that it 
is their responsibility to bring Christian virtues to bear in the interests of 
a healthier society. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the new generations bring these fruits, corruption is defeated, violence 
is defeated, the Mafia is defeated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catania, a port and agricultural center in the shadow of Mt. Etna, suffers 
like the rest of Sicily from the vicissitudes of organized crime, its bishop 
told the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
 "These range from extortion rackets to Mafia violence to organized and petty 
crime, narco-trafficking . . . and the vampire-like behavior of the loan 
sharks," said Bishop Luigi Bonmarito. 
</P>
<P>
 In a powerful message to inmates at a home for juvenile offenders, the Pope 
said there is "a strong yearning in Sicily to be redeemed and liberated," 
particularly from "the powers of the Mafia and other dark forces." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those responsible for violence and arrogance stained by human blood will have 
to respond before the justice of God," he said in a message to the young 
prisoners. "Never must you surrender to the mortifying offensive of evil. Never 
must you allow yourself to be caught up in the spiral of hate which robs joy 
from life and closes the heart to hope and love." 
</P>
<P>
 A grass-roots anti-Mafia movement has been growing across Sicily since the 
killings in 1992 of anti-Mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. 
Mafia members accused of Borsellino's murder are on trial, and Falcone's 
alleged killers go to court early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the flux, the Sicilian church, led by parish priests, has emerged as a 
leading force against a Mafia that has killed more than lambs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am thinking of Father Giuseppe Puglisi, courageous witness to the truth of 
the Gospel," the Pope said at a morning Mass whose worshipers included the 
mother and sister of Judge Borsellino, killed by a car bomb in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Puglisi, 56, was executed by a gunman in the Palermo slum of Brancaccio in 
September, 1993, "a victim of hatred and violence," John Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchetti, the priest who was threatened Saturday, is a 55-year-old prison 
chaplain and runs a drug-rehabilitation clinic. His car was burned in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church is a target because of the difference between what it teaches and 
the culture of death that belongs to these people," Palermo Cardinal Salvatore 
Pappalardo told reporters when asked about the slaughtered lamb. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite unprecedented police successes since the killings of the judges, 
organized crime remains a cloying, deep-rooted fact of life in Sicily. Its 
leaders do not take affronts lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 On his last visit to Sicily, in May, 1993, John Paul scrapped the prepared 
text of a speech in Agrigento to deliver a powerful, emotional appeal to the 
church to stand up to the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 That summer, bombs damaged two churches in Rome, including the basilica of St. 
John Lateran, which is the Pope's titular church in his role as bishop of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 When Puglisi was slain last year, some church sources speculated that it may 
have been mob bosses' way of repaying the insult the Pope had dealt them in 
Agrigento. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Pope embarked for Sicily on Friday on his first trip since canceling a 
visit to the United States last month, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi told 
the Parliament that he would extend the mandate of 7,000 Italian army troops 
who reinforce police in Sicily as an anti-Mafia measure.

REAGAN SAYS HE IS IN EARLY STAGES OF ALZHEIMER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL and DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 In a poignant, hand-penned letter to the American public, former President 
Ronald Reagan disclosed Saturday that he is suffering from the early stages of 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life," 
Reagan, 83, wrote to "my fellow Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that at the moment he feels "just fine," Reagan explained that he was 
going public with his diagnosis to promote broader awareness of the disease -- 
a progressive, irreversible neurological disorder that kills more adults in the 
United States than any ailment except heart disease, cancer or strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an accompanying statement released by his Los Angeles office, Reagan's five 
personal physicians said the condition was discovered during routine medical 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past 12 months we began to notice from President Reagan's test 
results symptoms indicating the possibility of early stage Alzheimer's 
disease," the doctors wrote. "Additional testing and an extensive observation 
over the past few weeks have led us to conclude that President Reagan is 
entering the early stages of this disease." 
</P>
<P>
 In the two-page letter, Reagan, who lives in Bel-Air, maintained his 
characteristic cheerfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing 
the things I have always done," he said. "I will continue to share life's 
journey with my beloved Nancy and my family. I plan to enjoy the great outdoors 
and stay in touch with my friends and supporters." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends reacted with sober acceptance, some acknowledging that Reagan had 
seemed to be losing mental acuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Busch, spokeswoman for Reagan, said Saturday afternoon that the 
former President was with his wife at an undisclosed California location 
outside Los Angeles. Busch declined further comment, saying, "The letter speaks 
for itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's oldest President, Reagan was treated for several medical problems 
during his two terms in the White House. He underwent surgery for a prostate 
gland condition and a colon cancer lesion during his second term and was 
wounded in an assassination attempt shortly after he took office in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 A perpetual optimist, Reagan told a reporter after his successful colon 
surgery: "I didn't have cancer. I had something inside of me that had cancer in 
it and it was removed." 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter -- so informal that it included a scratched-out phrase -- Reagan 
wrote: "In the past Nancy suffered from breast cancer and I had my cancer 
surgeries. "We found through our open disclosures we were able to raise public 
awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 "So now, we feel it is important to share it with you," Reagan continued. "In 
opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater awareness of this 
condition. Perhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals 
and families who are affected by it." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "Unfortunately, as Alzheimer's disease progresses, the family often 
bears a heavy burden. I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from 
this painful experience. When the time comes I am confident that with your help 
she will face it with faith and courage." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country, Reagan's friends, political allies and foes expressed 
sadness at the news, as well as admiration for the manner in which the former 
California governor and Hollywood actor was handling it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typical Gipper," former Reagan speech writer Ken Khachigian said 
affectionately when Reagan's letter was read to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Khachigian said he had not seen Reagan for a couple of years but had heard 
reports "that he was somewhat less engaged. A lot of us who had been close to 
him thought that was just the normal aging process. 
</P>
<P>
 "But obviously this gives a more understandable medical explanation of why he 
was slowing down a bit," added Khachigian, an attorney and political 
consultant. "(It was) courageous of him as usual to come out with something 
like this. And I'm sure that over the next few years we'll see that he'll 
continue to have a sunny disposition, that he'll have his sunny, optimistic 
view of life." 
</P>
<P>
 In Oakland, President Clinton spoke of Reagan in his remarks to several 
thousand Democratic activists Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to ask you to do something we normally wouldn't do at a Democratic 
rally," Clinton said, asking the boisterous group to remain silent while he 
made an announcement. A low murmur of dismay could be heard rippling through 
the crowd as he told them of Reagan's condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It touched my heart," Clinton said of the news. 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to recount a story of having met with Reagan not long after 
Clinton's election as President. The two conversed about the job, and at one 
point, Clinton said, Reagan looked at him and said, "You know, I forgot what I 
was talking about, and it really makes me mad." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Reagan "disagreed on a lot of things," Clinton said, but he praised the 
former President for his decency. "He always fought with a sense of optimism 
and spirit," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Reagan had been "willing to put partisanship aside" and help him 
on issues such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Brady Bill 
limiting handgun sales, which was named after Reagan's former press secretary, 
James Brady. "I want everyone of you in this room now to give Ronald Reagan a 
hand and wish him Godspeed," Clinton said. The audience applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 In Houston, former President George Bush released a statement saluting Reagan 
"for his courage and (for) sharing this private matter with the American 
people. Barbara and I are thinking of our good friends, Ron and Nancy, and we 
wish them well." After the announcement was made, former Reagan staff members 
began phoning one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all caught off guard here," said Sheila Tate, who was Nancy Reagan's 
press secretary. "We're calling each other and feeling sad for him, and for 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate said a friend saw the news on CNN and contacted her at her McLean, Va., 
home. Tate immediately turned on her television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the handwritten letter, which I thought was incredibly moving and 
quintessentially Ronald Reagan," said Tate. In dealing with the disease, she 
said, Reagan thought about how he could help other people. "It's typical of how 
he's approached his whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 During his presidency, Reagan's age and health periodically became issues, 
particularly when he seemed unsure or forgetful. He would shrug off the 
concerns with jokes and made a point of being photographed while riding 
horseback on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued to make public statements and appearances after leaving office 
six years ago. Last spring he declared himself "pretty steamed" over 
Iran-Contra figure Oliver L. North's comments that Reagan had approved North's 
role in the illegal arms deal. But in recent years he had assumed a lower 
profile, attending fewer events and declining interviews. He appeared in 
failing health at last spring's funeral of former President Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan's physicians -- including Dr. Leslie Weiner of USC and Dr. James R. 
Blake of St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica -- said that although Reagan's 
health is otherwise good, "it is expected that as the years go on it will begin 
to deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, at this time, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease and no 
effective treatment exists that arrests its progression," the doctors noted, 
adding that they would have no further comment about Reagan's condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan's mother, Nelle, who died at age 77, also apparently suffered from 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jeffrey L. Cummings, director of the UCLA Alzheimer's Disease Center, said 
that judging from the coherence of Reagan's letter, he appears to be in the 
early stages of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings said he expected that the announcement would focus attention on 
Alzheimer's disease as news of Earvin (Magic) Johnson's illness in 1991 did on 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease, which is 
characterized by a progressive loss of mental function, including memory and 
language. About 100,000 people die of the disease each year. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 50% of those over 85 are thought to have Alzheimer's, although it 
can also strike people in their 40s or 50s. 
</P>
<P>
 The average time from diagnosis to death is generally seven to 10 years, 
although some may die sooner and some may live as long as 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease has three phases. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first stage, a patient notices some forgetfulness, which can create 
anxiety or depression. Then, in the second stage, the forgetfulness intensifies 
into severe memory loss, particularly short-term memory. The third stage 
entails severe confusion and disorientation, with some patients experiencing 
hallucinations and paranoid delusions. They may become childlike, violent or 
demanding. At this point, they are often unable to take care of themselves, 
needing full-time caretakers or placement in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 Alzheimer's can be hard to diagnose. Similar symptoms can be caused by a 
variety of physical diseases, including a tumor, strokes, hypothyroidism, 
pernicious anemia or Vitamin B-12 deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The disorder's most distinguishing characteristic is the presence of rock-hard 
plaques and tangles in the brain, through which a definitive diagnosis can be 
made after death. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer David Lauter and wire services contributed to this story. 
Reagan's Letter 
</P>
<P>
 Text of letter written by former President Ronald Reagan announcing he has 
Alzheimer's disease: 
</P>
<P>
 "My Fellow Americans, 
</P>
<P>
 "I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will 
be afflicted with Alzheimer's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Upon learning this news, Nancy and I had to decide whether as private 
citizens we would keep this a private matter or whether we would make this news 
known in a public way. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past Nancy suffered from breast cancer and I had my cancer surgeries. 
We found through our open disclosures we were able to raise public awareness. 
We were happy that as a result many more people underwent testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were treated in early stages and able to return to normal, healthy 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "So now, we feel it is important to share it with you. In opening our hearts, 
we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition. Perhaps it will 
encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are 
affected by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment I feel just fine. I intend to live the remainder of the years 
God gives me on this earth doing the things I have always done. I will continue 
to share life's journey with my beloved Nancy and my family. I plan to enjoy 
the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and supporters.

heavy burden. I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this 
painful experience. When the time comes I am confident that with your help she 
will face it with faith and courage. 
</P>
<P>
 "In closing let me thank you, the American people for giving me the great 
honor of allowing me to serve as your President. When the Lord calls me home, 
whenever that may be, I will leave with the greatest love for this country of 
ours and eternal optimism for its future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life. I know 
that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, my friends. May God always bless you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sincerely, Ronald Reagan."

IN KEY RACES, VOTER ANGER ACTS AS TOUGHEST OPPONENT; POLITICS: NATIONWIDE, 
INCUMBENTS ARE FINDING IT HARD TO OVERCOME A PERVASIVE ANTI-WASHINGTON MOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The three women enjoying lunch at H.R.H. Dumplin's Cafe and Bake Shop across 
from the Dyer County Courthouse agree on one thing: They can't find much to 
complain about. All three offer the same upbeat assessment of life in this 
quiet town about 90 minutes north of Memphis: good schools, little crime, a 
booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But their opinions diverge when it comes to politics, especially the 
surprisingly tight Senate race between three-term Democratic Sen. Jim Sasser 
and Republican Bill Frist, a 42-year-old surgeon who has never sought public 
office before and had not even registered to vote until six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Arnold, a homemaker, isn't wild about the "career politician aspect" of 
Sasser, but she's going to vote for him because his seniority could mean 
tangible benefits for the state. Kathy Robertson, who runs a preschool, is 
undecided: The bitter campaign has left her dubious about both men. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest and most confident voice belongs to homemaker Paige Robinson. 
"I'm the clean-sweep person," she says firmly. "I'm not happy with that 
arrogance in Washington. I'm not sure Frist is the right choice, but I want to 
vote against Sasser. Maybe it would be a wake-up call for the rest of those 
bozos." 
</P>
<P>
 Seated around a table in a place about as close as you can get to America's 
ideological center, these three friends are giving voice to the fundamental 
sentiments that could settle the fate not only of Sasser but also dozens of 
other endangered incumbents across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 With determined personal campaigning, veteran legislators such as Sasser and 
Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy are beginning to have some success at 
defusing voter anger by stressing their accomplishments and influence while 
raising doubts about their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 But as conversations in Dyersburg and other northwestern Tennessee towns late 
last week make clear, anger toward government, politicians and Washington 
remains a pervasive force in this year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a force sustained by a thick web of grievances on biting social issues 
from gays to guns, nourished by widespread perceptions of waste and 
self-enrichment in Congress and inflamed by the incessant electronic bellowing 
of talk radio and anti-incumbent political commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these politicians, they act like they are kings, and us poor folks are 
just struggling to make a living," said the improbably named Jackbenny Wood, a 
former Sasser supporter who runs a local public-access television station in 
Dyersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Though voters like Wood generally include both parties in their indictment of 
Washington, disappointment in President Clinton and a sudden disenchantment 
with government activism are focusing much of their resentment on Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this torrent, Democrats in this part of Tennessee face an almost 
apocalyptic prospect Tuesday: a loss not only for Sasser but also for Rep. Jim 
Cooper, a six-term legislator vying with Republican Fred Thompson, a folksy 
lawyer and part-time actor, for the Senate seat vacated by Vice President Al 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tennessee, the mystery of bad feelings in good times is as deep as anywhere 
in the country. As Sasser repeatedly pointed out in a dogged campaign sweep 
through this area last week, unemployment in the state is as low as it has ever 
been, and the growth in personal income has been as strong as anywhere in the 
country. But glowing economic news, usually a trump card in American politics, 
might not be enough to save him -- or his party in similarly close races across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 No single factor explains the discontent in Tennessee; the Democrats' 
difficulties here appear to reflect an accumulation of interlocking grievances, 
small streams that have combined into a powerful current carrying many GOP 
candidates toward victory. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the issue is guns: Over the bitter opposition of the National Rifle 
Assn., Congress recently approved restrictions on handgun purchases and a ban 
on certain assault weapons. The NRA now says it is spending more money on 
television advertising against Sasser and Cooper than in any other state. The 
ads are clearly finding an audience: "What Bill Clinton wants to do," complains 
Don Gray, an accountant in Troy, a speck of a place north of Dyersburg, "is 
arrest the guns and let the criminals go free." 
</P>
<P>
 For others in these heavily religious communities, where churches still post 
public signs warning of the evils of drink, the issue is Clinton's effort to 
allow gays and lesbians to serve in the military. Opposition to federal taxes 
is another bedrock political belief up and down Highway 51, along with distaste 
for welfare programs that seem to subsidize those who won't work. 
</P>
<P>
 These pro-gun, anti-spending, socially conservative sentiments are wound into 
the political culture here like the roots of a hickory tree. Historically, 
Democrats have tended to prosper despite them, but two new factors appear to be 
tilting the balance toward the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the polarizing figure of Bill Clinton, and -- just as important -- his 
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. To be sure, the President has his supporters 
here. But the dominant feeling seems to be summed up by the razor-edged country 
ditty in a Frist radio ad that lampoons Sasser and "Little Slick Will." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dick Dunlap, a Democratic attorney in the town of Paris, the problem is as 
much cultural as ideological. Clinton, who presented himself during the 
campaign as a child of the small-town South, seems intent as President on 
upholding the cultural values of the Eastern elite with whom he has largely 
staffed his Administration, Dunlap complains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't enthused about having a lot of gays running around," he says, as a 
country-music band juices the crowd at a rally for Sasser. "And I think his 
wife hurts him, because our version of a political wife is Barbara Bush, not 
some yuppie lawyer who's all over everything. If it's gnawing at my guts, it's 
got to be gnawing at a lot of people's." 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural resistance to Clinton appears to be hurting all Democrats. But 
Clinton, in turn, could be the lightning rod for a much broader alienation from 
the political system. Even when much around them seems to be working well, 
people here consider Washington to be broken, a city willfully ignorant of the 
strains on average families. 
</P>
<P>
 Strikingly, the widespread antagonism is focused more at the process of 
lawmaking than at individual laws themselves. Even welfare for the poor doesn't 
draw as much hostility as pensions and pay raises for politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Frist and Thompson, the two first-time Republican candidates, have tuned 
their campaigns precisely to that pitch. Barnstorming in open-necked shirts 
(Frist in a campaign bus, Thompson in a signature red Chevrolet pickup truck), 
both emphasize reforming Congress more than promoting any particular policy 
agenda. Both back term limits, and Thompson has endorsed former Tennessee Gov. 
Lamar Alexander's plan to convert Congress into a part-time citizen 
legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 In their ads, Thompson and Frist refer to their opponents as "career 
politicians" -- in tones that might be appropriate for describing a repeat 
child molester. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, Thompson and Frist, two men of wealth, are trying to draw a 
new-wave, post-Perot populist line in the political firmament -- identifying 
themselves with average people because they are not professional politicians. 
In response, Sasser (and to a lesser extent Cooper) are attempting to make a 
more traditional, populist contrast: painting their opponents as rich 
Republicans representing powerful interests at the expense of ordinary working 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Cooper has tried to dent Thompson's down-home persona by highlighting 
his work as a Washington lobbyist for savings and loans and big business 
clients, Cooper's own privileged background (he's the son of a former governor) 
and stiff, sometimes prickly manner has largely undermined the effort. Even 
Democratic insiders virtually concede the race to Thompson, an engaging, 
oversized personality who "just feels like a next-door neighbor," in the words 
of Russ Roland, a private investigator in Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 In his struggle for survival, Sasser has more assets than Cooper. For one 
thing, he's more comfortable with populist themes. In his campaign appearances, 
he mocks Frist's degrees from Princeton and Harvard ("Tennessee schools weren't 
good enough for him," sniffs Sasser, a University of Tennessee graduate) and 
condemns his support for the GOP tax cut plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He comes from an elite environment; he's a multimillionaire," Sasser says. 
"He has nothing in common with everyday working people in Tennessee." 
</P>
<P>
 Sasser has two other formidable chits. If he's reelected and the Democrats 
retain control of the Senate, he's a front-runner for selection as majority 
leader, a position from which, he points out at every stop, he would be in a 
position "to get things done for our state." And in Frist, Sasser has an 
opponent who lacks Thompson's wit and gruff charisma and who has displayed a 
penchant for self-inflicted wounds. For instance, Frist recently told a tobacco 
audience that children should be allowed to smoke if their parents approve, 
then reversed his position after national health organizations pointed out it 
seemed a somewhat eccentric view for a heart surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as the three women in Dyersburg continue their conversation at the cafe, 
the ceiling fans whirring softly overhead, the tall glasses of fruit-flavored 
iced tea now nearly drained, it's unclear if all of that will be enough to save 
Sasser. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the table -- as essentially across the state -- there is one solid vote 
for Frist, one solid vote for Sasser, and, in Robertson, one ambivalent voter 
unsure which way to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many here, Robertson would like to throw a symbolic rock through the 
Capitol's window: Scandals, pay raises and disarray in Washington, she says, 
"almost makes you think the whole system needs to be revamped." 
</P>
<P>
 For all her hesitation about Frist, those are the kind of sentiments that 
could spell trouble on Tuesday for Sasser and Democrats all across America.

PRESIDENT RIDICULES GOP STANDS; POLITICS: CLINTON LAMBASTES REPUBLICANS AT AN 
ANAHEIM APPEARANCE, SAYING HIS FOES REFUSE TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR ECONOMY. HE 
THEN CALLS FOR BIPARTISANSHIP AND AN END TO 'VERBAL BOMBS' IN CAMPAIGNING.

<P>
 President Clinton poked fun at Republican candidates Saturday, likening their 
anti-government campaign rhetoric to the statements of a person who seeks a job 
while promising to not do anything if he gets hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to an audience of about 5,000 Realtors gathered for their annual 
convention here, Clinton compared the GOP candidates to a person who says, 
"Hire me to work in your real estate office because the real estate industry is 
inherently sick, and you couldn't do anything right if you wanted to, and if 
you hire me I'll sit in the office all day and I won't try to sell a house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seriously entertaining giving our votes to people who tell us these 
things." Government, he said, "is neither inherently good or bad. It is our 
tool. It is the instrument that reflects us. It is what we make of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks, which came in the form of a long digression from a speech 
about a new Administration initiative on housing, underlined his frustration 
with what he sees as a lack of credit for his Administration's role in 
improving the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 He has repeatedly commented on that in recent weeks, saying at times that he 
needs to do a better job of communicating his record to the public, but at 
other times complaining that the press and the Republican opposition have 
failed to give him a break. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he pointed to the Republicans. Noting a series of encouraging 
economic statistics, including Friday's announcement that unemployment has 
dropped to a four-year low, Clinton said the GOP has taken the position that 
"if anything good happens in this country while Mr. Clinton is in office, it's 
either in spite of him or unrelated." 
</P>
<P>
 Having lambasted the GOP for its anti-government stance, Clinton then asked 
for bipartisanship and an end to negative campaigning, saying that "we can 
solve our problems, but only if we speak with one another and listen to one 
another and stop just throwing these verbal bombs across the fences that divide 
us and turn us into cynical and negative people." 
</P>
<P>
 That remark drew a loud ovation from the audience, one of several Clinton 
received from a group that traditionally has included considerably more 
Republicans than Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, speaking to several thousand Democratic activists at a 
get-out-the-vote rally in Oakland's Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center, Clinton 
put a far more partisan cast on the same line of argument. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans, he told the cheering crowd, say that nothing government does 
"makes a difference." He then reeled off a series of measures that he said his 
Administration had accomplished, ranging from expanded trade with Mexico and 
Asia to increased immunization for children and more spending for Head Start to 
reducing the federal deficit, saying for each one: "It does make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't tell me that we're not stronger, and it doesn't make a difference. I 
say it does make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also repeated his attacks on the anti-illegal-immigrant Proposition 
187. Backers of Proposition 187, he said, are trying to appeal to anger, not 
reason. "187 says: 'Let's be real mad and take it out on the kids.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On his way to the rally, Clinton got a direct view of the intense views that 
187 supporters hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving Los Alamitos Naval Air Station, Clinton, as he usually does, worked 
his way along a rope line, shaking hands with those gathered to see him off. 
Usually in such settings, Clinton exchanges only brief remarks or greetings 
with those along the line, but this time, he encountered a serviceman who began 
to argue with him about the proposition. The two spent roughly five minutes 
discussing the subject before Clinton moved on. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the man, who identified himself only as Sgt. Wozniak, said Clinton 
had laid out his reasons for opposing the proposition, and that he had laid out 
his reasons for supporting it, but that neither man had changed positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also pushed his attack on the Republicans in his weekly radio address, 
returning to his charge that the GOP promise to cut taxes, increase defense 
spending and still balance the budget "would require a 20% cut across the board 
in every other part of government. That's cuts in Social Security, Medicare, 
student loans, assistance to farmers, veterans benefits, the crime bill -- the 
things that make us stronger, smarter, more secure." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican response, Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas denied that 
his party has any plans to cut Social Security and said that "in a state of 
near panic," Clinton and Vice President Al Gore "are resorting to scare 
tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole then indulged in some scare talk of his own, charging that the 
Administration was considering large cuts in farm programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, neither party has been willing to acknowledge publicly what nearly 
all independent experts on the federal budget agree on -- that over the long 
term, the budget deficit cannot be eliminated without some trims in popular 
entitlement programs, a category that includes both Social Security and farm 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's ostensible purpose in the Anaheim speech was to announce a new 
initiative on affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 As he noted in his speech, the Administration has taken several actions that 
were urged by real estate brokers, most notably a series of tax-law changes 
that restored deductions aimed at stimulating the real estate market. In the 
new initiative, he said, he hoped to work closely with the industry again. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton portrayed his proposal as a major initiative, it basically is 
little more than a plan to begin planning. Under the initiative, Housing and 
Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros will meet with real estate 
industry officials, bankers, community activists and others to develop a 
strategy to reduce regulatory, financial and social barriers to home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Saturday, White House officials said Clinton may travel to Haiti in the 
next few weeks to visit U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who recently visited American troops in Kuwait, could travel to Haiti 
over Thanksgiving week or early in December in connection with a Latin American 
summit scheduled for Miami in the second week of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Clinton hopes to boost morale among U.S. troops in Haiti by a 
visit but that final plans had not yet been made. National Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake visited Haiti earlier this week. He met with troops and Haitian 
government officials and has discussed the situation there with Clinton since 
his return, officials said.

<P>
 The Quichua-speaking villagers around this bustling Amazonian oil town blame 
Texaco Inc. for the black crude oozing from old storage pits, for their 
forest's oil-stained stream beds, even for the lack of game in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company ran off all the animals," complained Oscar Machoa, one of 50 
residents sitting on wooden benches under the metal roof of an old equipment 
shed -- women and babies on one side, men and boys on the other -- at a village 
meeting in nearby San Carlos. 
</P>
<P>
 But Machoa and local leaders in other countries around the globe have gone 
beyond complaining about foreign oil producers in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
 From Machoa's corner of the rain forest, Indian groups are suing Texaco in a 
U.S. district court, seeking more than $1 billion to clean up the Amazon's oil 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 And elsewhere, from Nigeria to East Timor, increasingly sophisticated demands 
are confronting U.S. energy companies, which have greatly expanded their hunt 
for new oil overseas as exploration prospects have dimmed at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local groups accuse the companies of wreaking environmental damage, 
others of human rights abuses. Many have sought concrete bounties in exchange 
for welcoming Big Oil -- demanding, for instance, a new hospital, school or 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to set a precedent that an indigenous community can demand 
accountability," said New York-based environmental activist Judith Kimerling, 
one of the lawyers who has filed suit against Texaco on behalf of Amazonian 
Indian federations and other rain-forest groups. Such legal hammers, wielded in 
U.S. courts, are going to make "every U.S. oil company think long and hard 
about its international actions," she warned. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of oil exploration in the developing world has been a drama of 
exploitation, corruption and lush rewards -- most of them going to risk-taking, 
entrepreneurial corporations from the industrialized West. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the 1880s, companies were granted concessions giving them 
virtually sovereign sway over exploration tracts. But since the 1970s, central 
governments in developing countries have been able to command much-improved 
terms, often reaping half the profits -- and bearing little of the risk -- of 
petroleum production. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas exploration and production spending by the 18 leading U.S. oil 
companies grew from 28% to more than 61% of their exploration budgets from 1982 
to 1992, according to a study by the American Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 But until recently, only rarely have the local people of a developing nation 
had much say in the fate of their region's rich resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real problem in country after country where the resources are 
considered state-owned," said Owen J. Lynch, who teaches at the Johns Hopkins 
University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. Central 
governments make natural-resource agreements without cutting the locals in on 
the deal, he said. "We're talking about hundreds of millions of people, and 
they're considered squatters on public land." 
</P>
<P>
 So, many local groups are pressing their case directly to U.S. companies, 
often through environmental and human rights groups based in the industrialized 
nations. And around the globe, this newfound political sophistication has 
substantially changed the game: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Papua New Guinea, indigenous groups hold what amounts to veto power over 
foreign energy projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Myanmar, formerly Burma, the concerns of local groups are squelched by an 
authoritarian regime, but Western allies have brought their complaints directly 
into U.S. oil companies' boardrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Russia, American companies as part of oil-production deals have agreed to 
provide communities with medical supplies and to build low-cost housing for 
Russian soldiers returning from former East Bloc nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting into Kuwait in the 1940s, one of the major (oil companies) was asked 
to provide a yacht," said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates. "Now it's housing." 
</P>
<P>
 For the oil companies, the hazards of exploration "have shifted from geologic 
or technical risk to commercial or political risk," added J. Robinson West, 
president and CEO of Petroleum Finance Co., based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent oil workers' strike in Nigeria underscored the power of an emboldened 
populace. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-week strike cut production an estimated 29% for resident foreign oil 
companies, which include Chevron and Mobil. The strikers, who sabotaged some 
facilities, had called on the companies to halt operations. Their goal: to cut 
off government revenue as they pressed to install jailed opposition leader 
Moshood K.O. Abiola as president. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies declined, saying that would have amounted to internal political 
interference. Nigeria's military head of state now commends "our major partners 
in the oil industry" for their support during the strike, which failed in 
September when the junta arrested strike leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, it was the success of the grass-roots campaign aimed at prodding 
U.S. businesses to pull out of apartheid South Africa that gave hope to efforts 
around the world to influence corporate behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a while, but eventually most of them left," said Paul M. Neuhauser, a 
University of Iowa law professor who represents church groups of the Interfaith 
Center on Corporate Responsibility, the New York-based organization at the 
heart of the anti-apartheid campaign in the 1970s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 One target now eyed by the interfaith center is China, where foreign companies 
have invested more than $5 billion in the oil hunt -- but whose Communist 
regime's human rights record is criticized worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 And the center already is campaigning to introduce shareholder resolutions at 
Unocal and Texaco annual meetings, hoping to force management to stop doing 
business in military-run Myanmar. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sister Valerie Heinonen, director of the center's militarism 
program, Myanmar villagers tell church activists that government soldiers are 
forcibly displacing whole villages and then drafting the locals to work -- 
without pay or even food -- to prepare areas in advance of a planned petroleum 
pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's where the horror stories come in," Heinonen said. "These people 
are put to work either as laborers in the sense of hacking out a road, or space 
for a railroad, or to carry equipment or whatever the soldiers need." 
</P>
<P>
 Amoco already has pulled out of Myanmar, although the Chicago-based company 
maintains that it saw no evidence of slave labor. An Amoco spokesman said 
pulling up stakes was "purely a business decision driven by geology." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Unocal, which plans to stay in Myanmar, says that pipeline 
infrastructure work hasn't even begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have flown over the pipeline (route) several times, and we can't find any 
evidence to support the allegations," Unocal spokesman Barry Lane said. "We 
can't find any work going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Lane and others in the oil industry argue that the presence of U.S. companies 
actually spurs human rights progress in developing nations. Local people are 
"better off," Lane contended, "because of the wages we pay, the working 
conditions we have, the education, the training and the compelling day-to-day 
example of respect for human individuals and their rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal and its French partner, Total S.A., plan to train local farmers and 
others for higher-paying oil field work and eventually may set up a formal 
school like one Unocal runs in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Several U.S. ambassadors to Southeast Asian nations, speaking recently to 
Southern California business groups, noted that U.S. companies bring their best 
oil field equipment overseas, transferring that technology and operational 
knowledge to the developing nations' oil industries and workers. Japanese 
companies, by contrast, often bring older technology. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. firms also have more local employees in senior staff ranks, according to 
the diplomats. "American companies have done demonstrably better at moving 
Indonesians up," said Robert L. Barry, U.S. ambassador to oil-rich Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Indonesia is also at the heart of one of oil's toughest political 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, the predominantly Muslim nation conquered the former Portuguese 
colony of East Timor, a Roman Catholic enclave on an island 300 miles north of 
Australia. In the years since, up to 200,000 Timorese have been killed in a 
bloody campaign of subjugation. The United Nations -- including the United 
States -- does not recognize Indonesian rights over the area. The dispute is 
expected to be heard this year or early next by the International Court of 
Justice at The Hague. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Australia and Indonesia divvied up the potentially lucrative offshore 
oil rights in the waters between East Timor and Australia. U.S. companies, 
including San Francisco-based Chevron, have since bid for and won exploration 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if the World Court overturns the Australian-Indonesian deal? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to assess," said a spokesman for Chevron, which has not yet 
sunk a well. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. group representing the Timorese thinks otherwise. "The Indonesians 
haven't any right to sell oil in the water there," said Charles Scheiner, 
national coordinator for the New York-based East Timor Action Network. "The 
East Timor people themselves say they would be perfectly happy to negotiate 
leases with the Western companies, however." 
</P>
<P>
 A thousand miles to the east, in Papua New Guinea, Chevron has tried to meet 
local entanglements head on. And with good reason. The indigenous people of the 
island nation own 90% of the land, and traditional clans aggressively defend 
their rights, occasionally with ax and spear. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron spent 1988 to 1990 negotiating village to village to forge local 
agreements for a $1-billion pipeline and oil field project. Heeding 
environmentalists' recommendations, the company included a wide range of 
environmental safeguards -- planning, for instance, to haul equipment with 
helicopters during construction to avoid building a road. 
</P>
<P>
 Roads in undeveloped areas often are blamed for bringing destructive 
settlement, unchecked logging and other ills to the backcountry. But the 10,000 
people around remote Lake Kutubu -- poor even by Papua New Guinea standards, 
with per capita incomes averaging $60 a year -- had other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted Chevron's development to create jobs, with salaries that would pay 
school fees for their kids and build clinics. And, although some villagers 
opposed the idea, most -- tired of having to walk three days to get to 
transportation, local government facilities or health care -- wanted Chevron to 
build a road. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted "transportation access to the outside world at times, and also the 
frills of life -- to go buy some beer, or go into town," said Don Henry, 
director of the South Pacific program for the World Wildlife Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Henry's environmental group counseled villagers against the idea. And 
he has seen one of his fears realized since the project was finished this year: 
Small-scale logging already has appeared along the road's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Henry has been impressed by Chevron's efforts, which include not only 
the $40-million road but more than $45 million in contributions to other 
community projects. "We found this situation in Papua New Guinea more 
encouraging than anything we've run into," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco is receiving no such praise for the legacy of its decades of oil 
production in Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
 Today in the rain forest, petroleum towns such as Lago Agrio, Shushufindi, 
Sachas and Coca have grown from nothing into small cities where pickup trucks 
and buses come and go on streets lined with equipment yards, supply stores, 
bars and brothels. Pipelines stretch along the sides of roads coated with 
greasy waste from oil wells. From these roads, settlers slash and burn deeper 
and deeper into the forested hills. A 1.2-million-acre area, once dense rain 
forest and pristine rivers, is scarred with roads and pocked with oil wells 
after development by Texaco in the 1970s and 1980s that turned Ecuador into 
South America's No. 2 oil exporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics in Ecuador and the United States say Texaco, the fourth-biggest U.S. 
oil company, shares the blame for the damage with Petroecuador, the government 
oil concern that took over operation of the Texaco fields in 1990. (Texaco 
ceased all operations in Ecuador two years later.) 
</P>
<P>
 And those critics have clout. Ecuador boasts the best-organized, if sometimes 
divided, indigenous federations of any in the developing world. The local 
groups have strong advocates in the industrial nations -- including the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, Oxfam America and the Rainforest Action Network, all 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ecuadorean government's own preliminary evaluation of environmental damage 
runs to $5 billion, according to Luis Carrera, environmental adviser to 
President Sixto Duran Ballen. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco spokesman J. Michael Trevino is quick to agree with Ecuadorean 
officials who say Petroecuador did most of the damage. Still, he said, Texaco 
will pay for part of the cleanup: "We know there is limited and localized 
damage, and we are prepared to remediate it." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's latest offer, according to reports in Ecuadorean newspapers: $12 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think that's going to do it," retorted Cristobal Bonifaz, an 
Ecuadorean-born attorney practicing in Amherst, Mass., who sued Texaco in 
November, 1993, in a U.S. district court in New York. The lawsuit charges in 
part that Texaco executives used technology and methods in Ecuador that were 
below industry standards, all to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic Richfield Co., meanwhile, has sought to avoid Texaco's oily black 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1988 contract with Petroecuador, Los Angeles-based Arco has drilled 
three exploratory wells in a tract of forest crossed by the Villano River. The 
company hopes to drill more wells in the same area to develop the field. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first two well sites were capped, the earth was re-contoured with 
topsoil saved when the areas were cleared. Native trees grown in Arco nurseries 
were used in reforesting. Drilling wastes were re-injected into the ground, 
underneath potable water tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Rainforest Action Network and other U.S. environmental groups 
have hounded Arco in a series of public demonstrations -- in large part because 
the company negotiated agreements with individual Ecuadorean communities rather 
than working with a provincial federation of native communities known as OPIP. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the company bought the cooperation of local community leaders who 
knew less about potential damage than OPIP's leaders. W. Ken Keag, resident 
manager of Arco's Ecuador business, and other Arco officials deny it. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the case, OPIP leaders on a U.S. tour sponsored by Oxfam America met 
for 12 hours in March with Arco executives in Texas. Since then, more meetings 
in Ecuador have begun to develop a regional resource planning mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecuador's Ministry of Energy and Mines has pledged to create a national 
committee to monitor petroleum activities that, in an apparent first for Latin 
America, will include Indian and environmental umbrella groups. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, many indigenous leaders have come to agree that there is no 
alternative to some form of collaboration with the oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rafael Pandam, vice president of CONAIE, a major indigenous group that is 
suing Texaco, "We are sure that Ecuador cannot live without petroleum." 
</P>
<P>
 Parrish reported from Los Angeles, Long from Ecuador. In Search Of . . .  
</P>
<P>
 With domestic production down sharply, nine farflung regions of the world are 
the hottest spots for exploration today by U.S. oil companies. Virtually every 
venue draws the oil industry into political, social or environmental conflict 
with increasingly savvy local populations.

UNMET GOALS BESET CLINTON AT MIDTERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to be this way. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton rode into office 22 months ago on a wave of popular hope and 
a burst of optimism among Democrats that, after a generation of political 
exile, their party once again had a chance to restore itself in the eyes of 
America's voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, as voters prepare to go to the polls to deliver their verdict on his 
party, even Clinton's own aides concede that his effort to restore Americans' 
faith in activist government and to create a dominant new Democratic coalition 
has unequivocally failed. Instead of nailing down the final pieces of a stable, 
new Democratic majority, Clinton has spent the closing days of the campaign 
desperately trying to scare the remnants of the old Democratic coalition out to 
the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 His effort may work, at least in part. Republicans may or may not succeed in 
capturing control of at least one house of Congress in Tuesday's election. 
Clinton may or may not succeed two years from today in winning reelection, 
although most political strategists in both parties think his potential 
challengers look far stronger in prospect than they will turn out to be in an 
actual head-to-head contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the President avoids political disaster, he will awaken Wednesday with 
his larger goals still in tatters: Public cynicism about government stands at 
an all-time high, doubts about government's ability to solve the nation's 
problems remain as deep as ever and Democrats have made no noticeable progress 
toward expanding their support beyond the 43% that Clinton won in his election 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 That question has been on the minds of many of Clinton's aides and advisers, 
who believe that his twin goals remain achievable in the long term. They have 
already begun analyzing why things got so badly off track -- trying to 
determine how, after the election, they can start over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton presidency, Administration officials and both Democratic and 
Republican strategists agree, might have been far different up to this point 
but for three critical strategic blunders: 
</P>
<P>
 * The failure to make crucial policy choices during the transition to office 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * The decision to subordinate all other issues in the interests of winning 
congressional support for a health care reform plan that turned out to be 
politically unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
 * The inability to publicly articulate a rationale for the Administration's 
foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not all of Clinton's problems can be traced to his own errors. The 
Republican opposition made an unusually well-disciplined and intense effort to 
block the President on most major issues. On one crucial issue, the economy, 
Clinton has also suffered politically from trends -- particularly the decline 
in incomes for non-college-educated workers -- that lie well outside the 
short-term control of any chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the flaws in Clinton's own character that have led many citizens to 
mistrust him and that dominated political conversation in the first several 
months of this year lie largely outside the control of the White House, or at 
least of its staff. 
</P>
<P>
 And the public's souring on government did not begin with Clinton. From the 
mid-1980s through the onset of the last recession, roughly 40% of respondents 
told pollsters they believed that the government did the right thing most of 
the time. By the time George Bush left office, that number had substantially 
eroded, although Clinton has been unable to rebuild it. Last year, only 19% of 
those queried by the ABC News/Washington Post poll said they thought government 
did the right thing most of the time. Last month, only 21% said so. 
</P>
<P>
 But even allowing for all those problems, Administration officials and 
political strategists interviewed in recent weeks agree that the White House 
has not always been its own best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 On the towering issue of health care reform, many aides now openly criticize 
both the timing and the substance of the Administration plan -- a surprising 
turn, considering the prominent role that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
played in putting it together. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, for example, says he accepts the criticism 
leveled by outside critics that Clinton erred by pushing a health care plan 
that would have expanded the role of government before he had convinced 
Americans that he had improved the government's ability to handle its existing 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "In hindsight," Panetta said in a recent interview, "it would have been better 
if we had taken on welfare reform and other reform issues" before diving into 
health care. By taking on those subjects -- reforming parts of the government 
that the public considers failures -- Clinton could have consolidated his 
support and sent a message "that this President is a centrist," Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton clearly had to "present health care reform as a proposal" and "begin 
the debate," Panetta said; otherwise, he would have seemed to be walking away 
from a central promise of his campaign. "The real question is tactics. What 
would you have moved first?" The White House's single-minded focus on health 
care to the detriment of all other proposals probably was a mistake, Panetta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, speaking on the condition that their names be withheld, offer blunter 
assessments. Health care reform "obliterated the rest of the agenda," one White 
House aide said. "It sucked up all the oxygen." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, Clinton and his aides repeatedly compromised away other 
goals to prevent them from interfering with health care. Protecting the health 
care initiative, for example, became the rationale for holding back on welfare 
reform, for postponing conflicts over the crime bill and for delaying key 
decisions on the pending world trade agreement. In the end, none of those 
trade-offs got Clinton what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, the substance of the health care plan -- following as it did 
Clinton's successful move to raise taxes in order to shrink the federal budget 
deficit -- tagged him indelibly in the public eye as an advocate of traditional 
Democratic big-government solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only did we not get the legislative success, but for whatever reasons, 
the initiative was positioned in such a way that it raised all the old fears 
about Democrats and government," said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. The 
health care plan allowed Republicans to raise "the negative specters of taxes 
and government control" and, in the process, "the flagship issue got badly 
sullied." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems with the health care effort point up a central theme that emerges 
from analyses of where Clinton got off track -- a theme that departs noticeably 
from conventional wisdom: Despite the public image of Clinton as a President 
overly attuned to polls and public relations, his Administration has suffered 
at key points from too much absorption with substance and too little attention 
to politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly in the early days of the Administration, "there really was a 
sense of 'that was the campaign, this is government, this is different,' " one 
White House official said. Too many people "forgot about the politics." 
</P>
<P>
 In the health care effort, for example, officials such as Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen -- who had long experience both with the micro-politics of 
Capitol Hill and the broader political climate of the country -- were largely 
left out of the process until the proposal was well along toward completion. 
Those who did develop the plan, most notably White House policy adviser Ira 
Magaziner, had little national political experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides point to similar problems during Clinton's transition to office, a 
period now almost universally regarded inside the White House as a time of 
tragically lost opportunities. Clinton spent most of the transition 
concentrating on the selection of his Cabinet and made none of the crucial 
choices needed to develop either an economic strategy or a political plan for 
his first few months in office. Because of that, Clinton entered office without 
any major initiatives to announce, allowing others to set the agenda for his 
opening weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 That failure set the stage for one of the Administration's most lasting wounds 
-- the fight over gays in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The gays-in-the-military issue "sent totally the wrong signal" to the voters 
whom Clinton had been hoping to win over, says Republican pollster William 
McInturff -- a view shared by most Democratic analysts. Clinton's closest 
advisers had never intended to make the issue so prominent so early, but the 
lack of a ready agenda allowed his opponents to force the topic to the fore. To 
this day, the perception that Clinton's first effort as President was not 
directed toward the economy, but instead toward gays, continues to damage him 
among a broad swath of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the 'read my lips, no new taxes' of this Administration," McInturff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over gays in the military, and Clinton's apparent vacillation 
in handling the issue, set a corrosive tone for the first six months of the 
President's term -- erasing much of the initial goodwill that surrounded his 
inauguration. In the environment that resulted, other controversies, such as 
the fights over Administration nominees Zoe Baird and C. Lani Guinier, loomed 
far larger than they otherwise might have. 
</P>
<P>
 The other problem traceable to the transition was the lack of any coherent 
strategy to sell the Clinton economic plan once he decided on its contents. As 
a result, Clinton's opposition was once again able to define his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the closing weeks of the fight, the White House did nothing to highlight 
the fact that the Administration's budget plan contained a tax cut for millions 
of working families in the form of a higher earned income tax credit. To this 
day, polls show the vast majority of Americans, including those who benefited 
from the reduction, do not know it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 While those problems can be traced back in large part to a failure to make 
timely choices, a final strategic error -- the lack of public communication on 
foreign policy -- resulted from a deliberate decision. Clinton and his aides 
believed that one of the characteristics that voters held against Bush was his 
evident preference for foreign, rather than domestic, policy-making. As a 
result, as Clinton chose his foreign policy team, communicating with the public 
received a relatively low priority. 
</P>
<P>
 As foreign policy reversals piled up, beginning with the Somalia crisis in the 
summer of 1993 and extending through multiple failures in Bosnia, that failing 
harmed the Administration's image, aides now concede. While voters may not care 
deeply about foreign matters, they did, it turned out, care about what they saw 
as a lack of competence in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton aides insist that their foreign policy was never as bad as it looked, 
and point to recent successes as evidence. But they concede they failed to 
explain their positions to the country. Clinton "was unable to carry it, and 
the people who were supposed to carry it couldn't," one aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides now insist that many of those problems have been rectified. Overseas, a 
string of successes has boosted Clinton's stock. The political naivete and 
overreaching that characterized the health care initiative have been tamed, 
they say, noting as an example that a new health care plan for next year will 
be put together by Panetta and economic policy chief Robert E. Rubin -- with 
Magaziner playing only a "supporting role." 
</P>
<P>
 But even assuming those hopeful predictions prove true, Clinton and his aides 
now face the toughest assignment of any -- starting over. 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT: Administration officials look ahead at the major options for the next 
two years.

LONG-TERM SURVIVORS OFFER CLUES TO CANCER THERAPIES; MEDICINE: AT LEAST 50% OF 
PATIENTS WITH THE DISEASE WILL BE CURED. SCIENTISTS ARE ASKING WHY SOME BEAT 
THE ODDS.

 "Make the next six months the best of your life," the doctor told Jerilyn 
Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 It was August, 1979. Ross, 33, had just learned the grim news: Cancer cells 
from a malignant melanoma surgically removed seven months earlier had migrated 
to a lymph node under her arm. Her doctors were pessimistic. Melanoma, a skin 
cancer that often starts as a black mole, does not respond to drugs or 
radiation, and can be deadly once it spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 15 years later -- and about to celebrate her 48th birthday -- Ross 
is cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, Natalie Spingarn, 52, was diagnosed with breast cancer. By 1977, it 
had metastasized, or spread, to her spine. By 1979, it was in her bones. In 
1982, she developed cancer in the other breast. "You have one year, maybe two," 
her doctor told her in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years later -- and 20 years after her initial diagnosis -- she is still 
going strong. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 8 million Americans have survived cancer, and at least 50% of 
those who develop the disease will be cured. To be sure, most of these are 
people in whom the cancer is detected early. Stories of spontaneous remission 
are extremely rare, and cases of long-term survival after metastasis also are 
much less common. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, they exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is, why? Why do some people beat the odds while others with 
similar medical profiles succumb? In recent years, scientists have begun paying 
greater attention to the question, believing the answers could provide valuable 
insights into the body's response to cancer -- and to cancer therapies -- and 
help lead to new approaches to fighting the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some very interesting clues that come out of chance observations in 
medicine, particularly from these long-term survivors who have beaten the 
odds," said Dr. Harmon Eyre, an oncologist who is chief medical officer for the 
American Cancer Society. "They should never be overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists now are examining all of these questions in trying to design 
strategies against a disease that is the second-leading cause of death among 
Americans -- after heart disease -- but probably the one dreaded the most. 
</P>
<P>
 The field "is exploding," said Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, a National Cancer 
Institute researcher who has devoted virtually his entire career to seeking 
ways to use and strengthen the body's own defenses against cancer. "I think 
it's become one of the most exciting areas in cancer research." 
</P>
<P>
 In some of these success stories, the reason for a good outcome could be as 
basic as the skill of the medical team -- the surgeon who operates, the 
chemotherapist who calculates the doses of drugs and administers them or the 
radiologist who delivers the radiation. It could also depend on the destination 
sites of metastasized cells -- if they spread to the bones, for example, an 
individual can live for many years with cancer; if they end up in vital organs, 
death can be swift. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the answers also may be found in the complexities of the body's 
genetic makeup or its immune system -- that is, how the body's defenses respond 
to the presence of alien cells. Or answers may come from how the body tolerates 
chemotherapy; doses can be made strong enough to kill tumors if the patient can 
withstand the onslaught of a drug's often-toxic side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a subset of people who have an unusually good response under usually 
unfavorable circumstances," said Dr. Sam Broder, NCI director. 
</P>
<P>
 As to why this happens, "it's a complicated question," Broder said. "Experts 
have postulated that some have better immune systems that can synergize with 
the chemotherapy or hormones that are used. Or that they are resistant to 
(drug) side effects. Or, by the luck of the draw, the tumor is just unusually 
sensitive to the (drug) agents. . . . Every person's response is variable." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he adds in a note of caution, "the biologies of different cancers are 
different. A diagnosis of lung or pancreatic cancer is a very bad diagnosis. It 
is important to have no illusions about this. Basically there are certain 
cancers that are very difficult -- or impossible -- to treat." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, a growing emphasis has been placed on trying to home in on the various 
ways in which the body naturally responds to cancer and in seeking ways to 
strengthen those responses. Most researchers believe that the body almost 
always tries to mount some kind of a response, but the battle often typically 
favors the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, scientific and medical journals periodically have reported 
research that reveals intriguing clues about the body's relationship to the 
onset and spread of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month, for example, Dr. Michael O'Reilly and Dr. Judah Volkman, 
researchers at Children's Hospital in Boston, announced they had identified a 
hormone-like factor in animals that appears to check the growth of secondary 
tumors formed by metastasizing cells, often the tumors that ultimately cause 
death. They have also found preliminary evidence that this chemical exists in 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
 The substance, called angiostatin, apparently is a natural drug that 
circulates in the bloodstream after being produced by large primary growing 
tumors, such as those in the breast and colon. The hormone is apparently one of 
the body's defenses against a tumor spreading, and it appears to slow the 
growth of blood vessels to secondary tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer experts say they hope the newly discovered substance -- if it can be 
produced through biotechnology -- can be used to help the body's chances in 
this battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If cancers don't grow beyond a millimeter in size, they won't kill you -- and 
to grow, they need blood vessels," Eyre said. "Find a way to block the vessels, 
and people could live with cancer for many years." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg has also searched for years for evidence of the body's natural 
ability to fight cancer. He became hooked on the approach in 1968 after 
encountering a patient whose stomach cancer apparently had disappeared 
spontaneously a dozen years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1956, the Massachusetts man had received a hopeless prognosis: He would die 
within several months from an untreatable gastric tumor. When Rosenberg found 
him alive years later, he at first was convinced there had been some mistake, a 
misdiagnosis perhaps. But a scrutiny of the patient's records proved there had 
been no mistake. The man's cancer had simply vanished on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The man's body had cured its cancer. But how?  
</P>
<P>
 Transfusing the man's blood into another dying cancer patient failed, but it 
set Rosenberg on a quest to determine ways in which the body's immune system 
could be harnessed in the cancer battle. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his colleagues at the NCI have spent most of the last decade studying 
the body's immune response to melanoma and kidney cancer, two malignancies long 
recognized as highly responsive to immunogenic factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg has treated more than 1,200 patients with several different kinds of 
experimental immune-based therapies, with a mixed success rate. About one-third 
of the melanoma patients showed tumor shrinkage. And about 10% of all the 
patients treated -- most of them individuals who likely would have died within 
several months -- have experienced long-term remissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get a long-term response like that, the chances are very high it 
(cancer) will never recur," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there have been some spectacular successes amid many failures, 
Rosenberg is also focusing on trying to discover why some patients do not 
respond. If the answers are determined, he says, they could be used to alter or 
fine-tune the therapies. 
</P>
<P>
 His early experiments involved doses of Interleukin-2, a chemical produced by 
the immune system that now can be mass-produced, and the use of 
lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, another type of immune system cell, in 
conjunction with IL-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, he and his NCI colleagues reported that they had identified a 
gene in normal cells that produces a protein capable of stimulating the body to 
defend against melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
 This immune response -- also discovered by Rosenberg in 1988 -- involves 
certain immune cells found in tumors, known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, 
or TIL, that can attack and destroy tumor cells. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes that the gene, known as MART-1, or the protein itself 
could serve as the basis of a melanoma vaccine. Such a vaccine could be given 
to people who already have the disease, or, eventually, even to those 
identified to be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of such an approach, he says, is that therapy directed against 
melanoma could cause minimal side effects because skin pigment cells are not 
necessary for any life function. 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another approach, researchers are studying genes in cancer cells to try 
to pinpoint how and where a cancer will spread. How a cancer spreads is 
considered critical to a patient's prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that cancers vary greatly in their metastatic potential and growth 
rate, and we know this is under control of the genes in the cancer cells 
themselves," he said. "We know that it takes a whole series of mutations in the 
genes in order for a full-fledged cancer to develop. Some of these mutations 
will determine how aggressively it spreads, and where it goes." 
</P>
<P>
 For some types of cancer -- breast cancer, for example -- there are several 
generally recognized patterns of spread, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first is a local recurrence in the same breast," he said. "A second is 
spread to the bones and not much elsewhere. A third involves visceral organs 
like the liver and the lungs, in which case, it tends to be rapidly fatal." 
</P>
<P>
 Determining the mechanism possibly could yield a way to predict the route of 
the cancer or even to manipulate the spread to make it less deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 With cancer, "the fact that there are long-term survivors, particularly in 
circumstances where the outcome would not typically be considered favorable, 
should be stimulus for further research -- and should provide some measure of 
optimism," Broder said.

DIVISIVE STATE CAMPAIGN LURCHES TOWARD FINISH

<P>
 With more than $90 million spent and the jagged emotions of Californians over 
illegal immigration laid bare, the state's nastiest and most contentious 
election contests in years will rumble to a close Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 8.8 million Californians are expected to cast ballots, either in 
person Tuesday or by mail, electing or reelecting a U.S. senator, a governor 
and a host of lesser constitutional officers and determining the fate of 
several hard-fought propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among them is the controversial Proposition 187, the initiative that 
would deny public education and non-emergency health services to illegal 
immigrants. The measure has divided the state's elected officials and 
candidates -- largely along partisan lines -- produced a raft of comment from 
national figures and provoked reaction among the state's residents unseen since 
1978's groundbreaking Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that proposition, which sharply limited property taxes, did not carry 
the overwhelming emotional content of Proposition 187, which has prompted high 
school students and tens of thousands of other opponents to take to the 
streets, forced proponents to defend themselves against charges of racism and 
led both sides to conclude that the proposition's immediate impact will be a 
rush to the courts to determine its constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition's fate, and those of the scores of candidates on the ballot, 
rest in the hands of an electorate that is polarized and discontented, 
according to pollsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters are in a mood to hear extremes this year," said John Brennan, director 
of the Los Angeles Times Poll. "They are not in the mood to hear a nice 
message. They are in the mood to hear a nasty message. I hate to say they are 
angry. They are just ornery." 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration -- specifically the hiring of illegal immigrants -- was the 
dominant focus for the final weeks in the close-fought election for U.S. 
Senate, which pits Democratic incumbent Dianne Feinstein against Republican 
challenger Mike Huffington. It is not at all clear as Election Day nears 
whether Proposition 187 will win or lose, or whether it will influence the 
outcome of the increasingly bitter governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls taken in the last week before the election suggested that Republican 
Pete Wilson was holding on to a lead over his Democratic challenger, Kathleen 
Brown, and that backers of Proposition 187 were also winning narrowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Brown was scrambling to use her opposition to the initiative to 
vault past incumbent Wilson, who over the past year has overcome a massive 
deficit in early polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, pollsters were nervously fingering their spreadsheets and 
campaigns were casting about to determine their standing. While Wilson had at 
least a bit of breathing space over Brown, polls in the Senate race had 
Feinstein and Huffington in a virtual dead heat. All of their handlers were 
whispering that the races would hinge on one overriding uncertainty: voter 
turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller said he expected 60.2% of California 
voters to cast ballots on Tuesday. That would be a slight increase from the 
58.6% who voted in the last governor's race four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 About 14.7 million Californians are eligible to vote Tuesday, 49% of them 
Democrats and 37% Republicans, with the rest belonging to minor parties. The 
figure was a record for a non-presidential election, easily eclipsing the mark 
of 13.5 million eligible voters in November, 1990. By contrast, 15.1 million 
were on the rolls for the 1992 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 Polling places will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The races climax today and Monday with candidates and proposition partisans 
circling the state by car, bus, plane and virtually any sort of transportation 
system that can bring them into contact with voters. Those hiding out in their 
homes will get no respite, however, given the dawn-to-dusk television 
commercials that are expected to bombard voters in these last few days before 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the staggering sums of money raised by candidates this election year 
has been spent on television, the major form of communication in this vast and 
varied state. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the last two weeks of spending was even counted, Wilson and Brown set a 
record in the amount of money raised in a race for governor -- and they were 
expected to spend every last cent of it. In the last two years, Wilson 
collected $26.8 million and Brown $20.7 million. The sums do not include 
millions more spent after Oct. 22, when the financial filing period ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The duo's combined running total of $47.5 million easily outdistanced the $45 
million raised and spent by Wilson and his opponent, Feinstein, in the 1990 
governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle for Senate also set a record, with Huffington and Feinstein 
spending more than $38 million with more than a week to go before the election. 
Of that, Huffington spent more than $27 million of his own fortune, and 
Feinstein had loaned her campaign more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent all that money, the candidates by Monday night will have little 
to do but sit back and worry over who comes to the polls -- a fact of political 
life that the major political parties have spent $13 million trying to 
influence this year. Republicans estimate that their get-out-the-vote efforts 
will cost $4 million, while the Democratic Party plans to spend $9 million to 
urge its voters to the polls, according to party chairman Bill Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Press described the party's effort as its most comprehensive ever, including 
50 offices, 250 paid workers, more than 5,000 precinct captains and a blizzard 
of mail all focused on 1.2 million "occasional" Democratic voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are voters who, as Press put it, "are the ones that vote for President 
and never think it is worthwhile to vote for governor." 
</P>
<P>
 To help remedy that, President Clinton flew into Los Angeles and Oakland, the 
heart of the two most Democratic areas in the state, for Friday and Saturday 
rallies intended to drum up support for party nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials and other national Democrats were casting a 
wary eye at California, which is central to the often-beleaguered Clinton's 
hopes for reelection in 1996. The President has been more popular in California 
than elsewhere in the nation, but his popularity has fallen during his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The year) 1994 is 1996 in California. It's clear," said Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican get-out-the-vote efforts were meant to target 10,000 of the state's 
25,169 precincts, according to party Chairman Tirso del Junco, and by the 
weekend included more than 3 million phone calls made from 1,200 telephone 
lines set up at party offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Democrats, Republicans were assaulting potential voters with mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP chairman, who has been involved in Republican politics for 30 years, 
said that his volunteers were being aided by optimism among the ranks. Across 
the nation, and in California, the political landscape has changed dramatically 
in the past two years. In 1992, Democrats were seen as the advocates of change 
and best suited to address pressing problems. Since then, polls have shown 
those factors swinging to the GOP side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very good because you know how bad it was a year and a half ago," Del 
Junco said. "When the party smells victory, it's a lot easier to do what we are 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican officials believe that their efforts will at least match those of 
Democrats because, although they are not spending as much money, they are using 
more volunteers. Traditionally, Republicans have had the edge in pre-election 
vote-getting efforts, a fact that Press has labored to change. 
</P>
<P>
 As the election neared, those in charge of get-out-the-vote efforts and the 
campaigns as well were trying to determine whether Proposition 187 would change 
the dynamics of the major races on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, who generally support the initiative, argued that it was likely 
to increase voter turnout -- but that the impact would be negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least right now, it appears that it will turn out approximately the same 
number of supporters as opponents," said Dan Schnur, the Wilson campaign 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Republican polls and other private surveys, supporters of the 
proposition were holding their own coming into the weekend, after having lost 
ground in the previous two weeks. But Democrats were hoping that their 
candidates would be propelled into office by the gusts of a late-developing 
tail wind against the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story of this election is 187," said party Chairman Press. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Brown, 49, changed the focus of her campaign in the final two 
weeks to reflect her belief that the initiative would be defeated -- and 
Wilson, a supporter, would go down with it. In travels across the state, she 
continued to hawk her economic plan but stepped up her criticism of Wilson's 
position on Proposition 187 and defended her opposition as a morally correct 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me the test of leadership today is going to be the test of 
holding people together and fighting to rebuild an economy, a sense of 
community and to rebuild the sense of family," she told students at Santa Maria 
High School last week. "And Proposition 187 tears it apart, takes it apart, and 
asks people to divide themselves up." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, for his part, spent the last two weeks of the campaign contending that 
he was the best candidate on the important issues of crime and jobs. Crime, an 
issue that he has used to bludgeon Brown throughout the campaign, was the topic 
Thursday when 200 members of the group known as Memory of Victims Everywhere 
gathered in Hollywood to honor the 61-year-old governor for his crime-fighting 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thank you for all the people who won't be dead this year . . . because you 
cared enough," said Collene Campbell, a leader of the crime victims movement. 
"We love you." 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate race turned in its final days on Proposition 187 and the broader 
question of the candidates' personal employment of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The big-spending Huffington campaign was rocked when, a few days after he 
endorsed the proposition, The Times reported that he and his wife had employed 
an illegal immigrant as a nanny for their children until last year -- a 
violation of federal law and one that inspired catcalls from Democrats that the 
congressman was a hypocrite. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last week it was reported that in the early 1980s Feinstein had employed 
a Guatemalan woman whom Huffington contended was an illegal immigrant. In any 
case, the employment occurred when it was not against the law and only after, 
Feinstein said, she had been shown paperwork identifying the woman as a legal 
resident of the state. Feinstein opposes Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The publicity garnered by the Senate and governor's races and some of the 
propositions has been so overwhelming that it has overshadowed contests for the 
other statewide offices, in which candidates have spent up to several million 
dollars but still languished in relative anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the contest for lieutenant governor, Democrat Gray Davis is attempting to 
trade in two terms as state controller for the post of second-in-command. 
Standing in his way is Republican Cathie Wright, a state senator from Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, who took over for longtime boss March 
Fong Eu when she left in February to become ambassador to Micronesia, is hoping 
to win the job outright. Running against him is a former Assembly Republican 
leader and current assemblyman, Bill Jones of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle for attorney general has dissolved into a contest of angry 
denunciations between incumbent Republican Dan Lungren, who is seeking his 
second term, and Democratic Assemblyman Tom Umberg. Central to their most 
contentious spats have been an Umberg television commercial that suggests that 
Lungren's policies contributed to the 1993 death of 12-year-old Petaluma 
resident Polly Klaas, who was kidnaped from her bedroom during a slumber party. 
Lungren heatedly denies any connection. 
</P>
<P>
 The race for state treasurer will determine whether March Fong Eu's family 
maintains its hold on state office even after her departure. Her son Matt Fong, 
unlike Eu a Republican, gave up his seat on the State Board of Equalization to 
run for treasurer. The Democratic nominee is former party Chairman Phil 
Angelides of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 For state controller, former Los Angeles city housing director Kathleen 
Connell, a Democrat, is running against former Republican assemblyman Tom 
McClintock of Rocklin in a race that has been notable for McClintock's ads, 
which purport to have a flinty Scot relative of McClintock attesting to his 
cheapness. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to replace John Garamendi as insurance commissioner is fellow Democrat 
and longtime legislator Art Torres of Monterey Park. His opponent is Charles 
Quackenbush, a Republican from Cupertino. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nonpartisan office of superintendent of public instruction, Democrat 
Maureen DiMarco is running against another Democrat, Assemblywoman Delaine 
Eastin. Eastin has the backing of most of the Democratic hierarchy. Di Marco, 
the former president of the California School Boards Assn., is Republican 
Wilson's secretary of child development and education. 
</P>
<P>
 Other propositions overshadowed by 187 include Proposition 184, which 
significantly lengthens criminal sentences and is, word for word, the same as a 
bill passed this year by the Legislature and signed by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186 would create a universal health insurance program for state 
residents. Proposition 188, devised and funded largely by tobacco firms, would 
repeal all local smoking bans and institute one looser, statewide policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 181 would authorize $1 billion in bonds to finance rail services 
for Californians. Proposition 183 would increase the number of days in which a 
governor has to place a recall election on the ballot to 180 from the current 
level of no more than 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 185 would impose a 4% gas tax to finance mass transit and other 
transportation projects. Proposition 189 would change the state Constitution to 
clarify that judges can do what they are already authorized to do -- deny bail 
to jailed, accused child molesters and rapists. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 190 would restructure the state Commission on Judicial 
Performance, which disciplines judges, by giving the public majority membership 
on the commission and requiring proceedings to be open. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 191 would convert the state's 47 rural justice courts into 
municipal courts. More Coverage

NEWS ANALYSIS; TRUCKERS GAINING INFLUENCE OVER AIR BOARD; ENVIRONMENT: CRITICS 
SAY WILSON HAS DRASTICALLY CURBED AGENCY'S INDEPENDENCE. INDUSTRY CONTENDS THAT 
IT JUST WANTS TO AVOID UNREASONABLE RULES THAT COULD PARALYZE STATE'S ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few sources of air pollution are as reviled by Californians as convoys of 
diesel trucks that belch dense, black clouds of smoke. But no one is exerting 
as much influence on the Wilson Administration's clean air policy as 
California's trucking industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Special interests -- most notably the California Trucking Assn. -- have 
wielded increasing influence over the state Air Resources Board's key decisions 
because Gov. Pete Wilson and his top environmental aide have stripped the 
agency of much of its independence, according to past and present officials of 
the agency and other air-quality observers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other industries have input into the Wilson Administration's 
clean-air strategies, no group has won as many recent concessions as 
California's 800,000 trucking industry employees. At stake are future 
regulations aimed at the 200 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxides emitted daily 
from diesel trucks, one of the largest sources of air pollution in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point at the board -- world-renowned for its bipartisan 
independence and innovative automotive standards -- came a year ago, when 
Wilson ousted longtime Chairwoman Jananne Sharpless. Her removal came amid a 
conflict with truckers over a mandate for low-sulfur diesel fuel that brought 
price increases and some engine malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That turned the trucking association into a 500-pound gorilla overnight," a 
former top-ranking air board administrator told The Times. "They were always 
difficult to deal with. But they didn't have the clout to become a problem. Now 
I hear . . . that every major issue goes through a political filter first." 
</P>
<P>
 Truck company owners were tired of the air board ignoring their concerns and 
suggestions about the regulations they face, so they now directly call the 
governor's office, where they say they get results, said Dave Titus of the 
California Trucking Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at it as democracy in action," Titus said. "Maybe we're fed up and 
we're empowered, but I think it is (all regulated industries), not just us. . . 
. The only thing independent about ARB was their independence from economic 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 The undercurrent of concern over the air board's direction is emerging at a 
crucial juncture for California. Facing mandates set by Congress, the state 
must mold a far-reaching, 20-year clean-air strategy by Nov. 15 or face 
sanctions and economically disruptive anti-smog rules proposed by the Clinton 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The air board convenes a two-day session to consider a controversial 
staff-drafted plan Wednesday -- the day after voters choose their governor and 
less than a week before the final version is due in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the agency came under fire for its choice of a consultant to gauge 
the plan's economic impact. The air board hired the same San Francisco-based 
firm paid by the trucking and oil industries for similar work used to oppose 
air-quality rules. The last-minute economic study comes at the behest of the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract "gives, at the least, the appearance that ARB's independence has 
been severely eroded," warned Jane Hall, a Cal State Fullerton economist who 
serves on the state's Research Screening Committee, in a letter to air board 
Chairwoman Jacqueline Schafer. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, at the urging of the trucking industry, the air board staff plans to 
temporarily suspend the beginning roadside inspections to test trucks for 
excessive smoke until engineers can agree on a reliable measuring device. The 
board in December will consider a 1 1/2-year delay. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucking industry is proud of its role in helping draft air pollution 
policy, saying unreasonable rules could paralyze the entire economy by 
disrupting transport of three-quarters of California's manufactured freight. 
</P>
<P>
 Truck company owners, who Titus says have in California more than 800,000 
employees and an annual payroll of $29 billion, have overwhelmingly supported 
Wilson's reelection campaign, with one Los Angeles trucking executive ranking 
among Wilson's top 20 contributors by giving $106,600. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Resources Board is probably the state's most powerful and far-reaching 
environmental entity, capable of transforming automobiles, trucks, fuels and 
other sources of pollution without legislative approval. From catalytic 
converters to electric cars to low-emissions gasoline, the air board's 
futuristic rules over the last two decades have fostered technologies and 
standards copied around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 According to air board officials, the governor's office rarely intervened in 
the past, leaving Executive Officer James Boyd and his staff insulated from 
partisan pressures while drafting rules considered by their board. 
</P>
<P>
 But today's air board is not the same agency that served under Gov. George 
Deukmejian, or even under Wilson two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not since Ronald Reagan has this agency been this demoralized and this lost 
in its mission," said John White, a longtime air-quality consultant in 
Sacramento for the Sierra Club and other environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Air board officials responsible for California's stringent standards "are 
either gone or on the run," White said. "The pattern of interference in very 
important decisions is now well-established." 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Strock, Wilson's secretary for environmental protection, said the 
governor only intervenes to ensure that the air board can consider all 
alternatives and resolve environmental problems with the most economically 
viable solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor does get directly involved in some environmental matters because 
he has made it a strong priority. . . . But that is in no way inconsistent with 
getting the best technical work done," Strock said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many industries, including the truckers, have raised issues that are 
appropriate to examine," he said, adding that no industry "has received any 
preferential treatment whatsoever. In fact, it's clear any ultimate state plan 
is going to rely a great deal on continued (emissions reductions) from various 
mobile sources, including trucks." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the air board's proposed plan would force California-based 
truckers to slash emissions in half by 2002. And in May, the board, with 
Wilson's endorsement, reaffirmed its mandate for auto makers to mass-produce 
electric cars for California by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, truckers face fewer mandates than the auto industry, but that is 
largely because no efficient and practical alternative fuels are available yet 
for heavy-duty vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can question the tremendous technical competence within the ARB," 
Strock said. "And no one can question that our air policy remains the world 
leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Some air-quality officials say the governor's top aides directed the air 
board's choice of the truckers' consultant to analyze its clean-air measures. 
But Strock denied that, and Schafer said economist Hall was originally asked to 
help but declined because she didn't have the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The air board lost some independence when Wilson, upon taking office, formed 
the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA) headed by Strock to 
oversee the air board and other agencies. Strock said that some air board 
employees were uncomfortable with that oversight change, but that it was needed 
to streamline and bring consistency to environmental policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists who formerly had allies among air board management worry 
that there has been a subtle erosion of the state's air program since then. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically they seem to be muzzled," said Cliff Gladstein, president of the 
Coalition for Clean Air in Santa Monica. "I do think the ARB has become . . . 
less responsive because of the way it has been managed from the governor's 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Local air-quality officials also say they notice upsetting changes in their 
state counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truckers certainly have the governor's ear," said an official from the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 When truckers complained to Wilson a year ago that new low-sulfur diesel was 
too expensive and causing fuel system leaks, the governor lambasted the air 
board for inadequately researching its rule and requested an emergency hearing. 
The fuel mandate remained intact after a task force concluded that oil industry 
refiners were largely at fault. But a month later, Wilson ousted Sharpless as 
chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest source of a political movement is hearing angry people picking up 
the phone," said Titus of the trucking association, which represents 2,600 
companies. "Our guys picked up the phone, and it became a loud chorus from very 
angry people." 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Anderson, the trucking group's executive vice president, said truckers 
are trying to clean up exhaust and have teamed up with environmental groups to 
find mutually agreeable options, such as tax incentives for owners who scrap 
their old, more heavily polluting trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiercest battles and biggest challenges are yet to come. Even with 
advanced technology, diesel trucks by 2010 are projected to eclipse automobiles 
as California's largest source of nitrogen oxides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think diesel in retrospect will prove to be the Waterloo for ARB," said 
White, the Sierra Club consultant. "Yet diesel also remains the most important 
task yet to be done."

ON CALIFORNIA: IF IT WEREN'T FOR ANNABELLA AND MARISELA . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So the immigration status of Dianne Feinstein's long-ago housekeeper Annabella 
has come into play, following close behind the big stir over Mike Huffington's 
nanny Marisela. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean Feinstein now will retract her strange proposal to charge every 
border crosser a buck? Probably not, as the Huff -- despite the presence of 
Marisela -- has yet to renounce his equally curious support of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead they'll devote the last 48 hours of the campaign to calling each other 
hypocrites, and let the voters sort out the mess. That a U.S. Senate seat is to 
be decided by a bout of tag-team nannymania seems only fitting. The political 
discourse that has bounded across California this election has made clear there 
is no greater threat to the state today than illegal domestics. 
</P>
<P>
 They dominate the debate, up and down the ticket. As candidates once were 
asked where they stood on Reds, this crop is confronted with the nanny 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever hired an illegal nanny, Governor?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, gulp, at least not knowingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly the steam generated by this issue underscores its importance, no? In 
fact, some of the more rabid immigrant-bashing candidates have gone so far as 
to imply that the Annabellas and Mariselas of California are to blame. For 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sure. I buy it. If it weren't for all those illegal nannies, after all, 
the everyday carnage that haunts the neighborhoods of South-Central Los Angeles 
would be eliminated. And if it weren't for illegal nannies, our astute 
political leaders might have foreseen that the end of the Cold War would dent 
the California defense juggernaut. They might even have lashed together some 
sort of plan for conversion to other industries. 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for illegal nannies, balancing the state budget would be a snap. 
That has been Gov. Pete Wilson's main point. Without the nannies, $112 billion 
would be enough to service the government. As it is, those darn nannies hog it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for illegal nannies, there'd be enough water to go around for 
everybody in California, north and south, farmer and city folk. There'd be no 
quakes, no fires, no riots, no recession. The skies over Southern California 
would be as blue as the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for illegal nannies, California might have developed -- or at 
least debated -- a plan for managed growth. Instead, houses and strip malls 
keep spreading out willy-nilly, gobbling up good farmland. And when the whole 
state is one big subdivision, we'll know who to blame. Doggone nannies. 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for illegal nannies, the state Legislature would be a model of 
efficiency. The family would be strong. Hollywood wouldn't crank out 
mind-rotting movies. Weapons of mass destruction would not be available to just 
any nut. The aerospace giants would quit shipping jobs wholesale to Texas. Our 
once proud public schools would not be a bad joke. Nobody would sleep on the 
streets in a cardboard box. 
</P>
<P>
 No, if it weren't for illegal nannies, the governor might have found time to 
share with us voters what he plans to do in his next term, if reelected. And 
the advocates of "three strikes" might have explained how the state will pay 
for all those new prisons the law will require. Kathleen Brown's plan to 
rebuild California might have received a bit of serious study in the media. And 
Huffington and Feinstein might have kicked around an idea or two for dealing 
with the national debt, say, or taking California into the next century and a 
changing world. Something like that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, this campaign has become a game of nanny, nanny, who hired the nanny? 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose it's important stuff, although there was a time I supposed 
otherwise. I once argued that the hysteria over illegal immigration was 
overblown. Only an estimated 1 in 30 residents -- and this figure most likely 
is a whopping exaggeration -- is in California without proper paperwork. Mostly 
these are people who take hard jobs that 29 out of 30 Californians wouldn't 
touch with a long stick. So what, I reasoned, is the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, now I see. If two humble domestics can seize control of a Senate 
campaign -- and they have -- and if such a tiny fraction of the populace can 
turn Californians passionately against one another -- and this, too, has 
happened -- who am I to question the importance of these people? They are a 
powerful force, capable of making the greatest state in the union go crazy, 
bananas, cuckoo, nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nanny. Nanny. Nanny. The nannies are in charge, and the question now before 
Californians is who to vote for? 
</P>
<P>
 Annabella or Marisela? 
</P>
<P>
 Myself, I've got a write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Poppins.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; HAPPY HOSTAGE; 'ABDUCTED' BY BROWN'S CHARM, CANDIDATE'S 
LIBERTARIAN HUSBAND HELPS CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He gruffs and grouses about the liberal media, skewers the Clinton "high 
dragonhood" of Elders and Shalala, and declares that "poor Dan Quayle" has 
gotten bad press to rival Bruno Hauptmann's. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he tells you he's voting for Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gordon Sauter, by happy admission, is "a hostage" in California's 
governor's race, a "government-loathing, tax-abhorring, bureaucrat-dreading 
Libertarian abducted by the wit, the charm, the intelligence and compassion of 
Kathleen Brown, my wife." 
</P>
<P>
 The skunk works at Fox Television, where Sauter, 59, is a consultant to the 
news division, could not have come up with a better plot device than this 
"Adam's Rib" casting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the normal (political) spouse, and I tend to think my message is 
effective because I am playing against type . . . and I like to go at it with a 
certain degree of humor. And I think in the long run, that, for me at least, is 
a more beneficial, effective way." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is his a male-spouse version of the Nancy Reagan adoring gaze. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day years ago that Brown informed Sauter she was going to law school, 
he responded, after a very long silence: "Kathleen, you know what I think of 
lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, Van," she said. "I know what you think of Democrats, too, and you 
married one." 
</P>
<P>
 As he chuffs across the state, speaking to groups and on talk shows in 
California's second-tier political and media markets, Sauter is always 
entertaining, often instructive, and sometimes -- but not inevitably, judging 
from the looks on some faces at the Salinas Rotary -- persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, still chuckling over the Ukrainian folk tale about the bird up to its 
neck in manure, and the moral fable about the Hindu, the rabbi and the 
journalist, the Rotarians elbowed aside their coffee cups and dessert plates to 
listen to Sauter's acerbic remarks that enfold his Brown-for-governor pitch 
like puff pastry around beef. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same coxswain's voice that once delivered fustian editorials on Los 
Angeles' CBS-TV affiliate -- some of which so offended his future wife that she 
agreed to a blind-date dinner just to set him straight -- Sauter said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not here in some kind of a battlefield conversion in which I rose from 
some fetid Republican swamp to the brightness and warmth of the Democratic 
Party. One of the reasons I celebrate Kathleen's candidacy is that she's not a 
career politician and she's certainly not a doctrinaire party acolyte who 
believes that all truth and all wisdom can only originate from one party." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Sauter ticks off what ticks him off about Gov. Pete Wilson and the last 
four -- make that 12 -- years of Republican governors. Some of his laugh lines 
tend to be delayed-action, and by the time his audience is giggling at the 
dependent clause, "If California's luck has really run out and Mr. Wilson is 
reelected. . . ," Sauter is on to another point. 
</P>
<P>
 On his Libertarian cross-stitch about government grown too intrusive and 
expensive, he embroiders, "This should be a Republican issue but it is not. 
Pete Wilson has grown far too comfy with government." 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Sauter gives Wilson failing marks on education. "Unless we turn 
out young people who can do First World jobs, we're doomed. . . . (The state of 
education) is inexcusable and it is to the point where our financial future is 
in jeopardy and Kathleen has a dedication to education." 
</P>
<P>
 And the governor's stand on Proposition 187 is "unconscionable . . . a public 
obscenity," dramatizing how the California commonwealth is in peril, Sauter 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the really fun stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics is a late arrival in his speeches; Sauter was on the circuit long 
before this election, talking about the news media and news technology, from 
his years as a newspaperman, his recent time at Fox, and his longer and 
often-criticized tenure at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 He contrasts an abundance of information -- radio, newspapers, TV, magazines, 
books -- and a news-consuming public that "unfortunately (gives) far too much 
reliance to television, which is unsuited as a medium . . . to be the core 
source of information in our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists' credibility is eroding by virtue of their argumentativeness, he 
contends, and even the technological advances that cut out the reportorial 
middlemen -- "no one has ever had more access (to information) in the history 
of mankind" -- have created some unease, with the potential for widening the 
gulf between haves and have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
 What got almost everyone at the Rotary lunch nodding in agreement was Sauter's 
indictment of a pop culture "characterized by flat-out decadence . . . an 
appalling absence of values. . . . All of us have contributed in one way or 
another to the coarse applause for the sexuality and violence and nihilism that 
is so rampant in our popular culture." There was no mention of some Fox 
entertainment programs, such as "Married With Children," that have come in for 
their share of critical finger-pointing on that score. 
</P>
<P>
 Sauter winds up his remarks with the heavy dessert of politicians, certain 
"self-aggrandizing windbag politicians wheezing across the countryside 
identifying themselves as enforcers of public morality. We should avoid these 
political mooches and their simplistic solutions. We as individuals must find 
within ourselves the answer to the social value questions of our communities 
and our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Did someone say "dessert"? 
</P>
<P>
 Sauter's two days a week on the campaign trail are as much a gustatory hajj as 
a political tour, a picaresque progress from a Basque restaurant in Bakersfield 
to a rib place in Gilroy. 
</P>
<P>
 Over mariachi Muzak and a late lunch of beef enchiladas and a Diet Coke in 
Salinas, after pecking at the ground-beef-tostada salad laid on by the Rotary, 
his humor can be as expansive as his waistline. 
</P>
<P>
 The only subject on which Sauter has been uncharacteristically closemouthed is 
how his wife's campaign is operating. 
</P>
<P>
 He got headlines in Ontario recently for saying that it has been "very 
difficult for me to recognize my wife in this campaign," that she "is not a 
liberal, and I probably have one of the most finely honed antennas for this 
type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 That's all he'll say on the subject now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't talk about the campaign," he says. "If I do, my opinions tend 
to be disconcerting and get in the way of people doing what they need to do 
over these final two weeks, so I stay out of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not part of the campaign, and if I sit back and begin to make value 
judgments -- 'Why didn't you do this, why didn't you do that?' -- I am not 
helping the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike most political spouses," Sauter says, "I happen to know a tremendous 
amount about some of the mechanics, which is both an asset and a liability, and 
at times it's very difficult to step aside. But ultimately that's what somebody 
in my position has to do, what somebody with my attitude has to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And here he steers the conversation back, adroitly, to why he is here, in 
Salinas, eating beef enchiladas under a slow fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am there with a glass of Chardonnay (for Brown) at the end of the day. . . 
. I just think the state cannot take four more years of this man."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; CANDIDATES FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION AND CLINTON; 
BROWN SEEKS BOOST FROM PRESIDENT, WHILE WILSON SCOFFS AT HIM. EXPERTS ARE 
AGHAST THAT DEMOCRAT'S CAMPAIGN HAD TO CANCEL ALMOST ALL WEEKEND TV ADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown, her campaign in the unprecedented position of having 
virtually no advertising presence on major California airwaves the weekend 
before the election, leaned Saturday on President Clinton to help turn out 
loyal Democratic voters who she believes could give her a chance to overtake 
incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, the target of Brown's and Clinton's gibes throughout the day, 
barnstormed in relative splendor through the Central Valley with other members 
of the Republican ticket, his campaign increasingly confident of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In public, both candidates' message Saturday could be whittled down to two 
spare topics: Clinton and immigration. Brown and Wilson, on opposing sides of 
the controversial Proposition 187 and in their views of Clinton, used both 
subjects in their efforts to gain last-minute votes. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Brown pleaded with 5,000 Democrats at a Clinton rally in 
Oakland to turn aside Wilson and the initiative that would deny public 
education and non-emergency services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an opportunity on Nov. 8 to send a message not just to those in 
California who are watching, but across this land," Brown said, echoing 
Clinton's theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican governor decried Brown's views and suggested that the President 
butt out of California political affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need Bill Clinton . . . or anyone else to tell us how to vote," he 
said. "We are going to take matters into our own hands." 
</P>
<P>
 In private, however, the focus was on Brown's meager finances. A lack of money 
forced her campaign to cancel almost all of the television time it had reserved 
for Saturday and Sunday. Isolated ads that had been bought earlier in the 
campaign as part of larger package deals were still running, Brown aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 The virtual silencing of Brown's campaign on television -- the basic mode of 
communication in California -- drew a reaction of astonishment from veteran 
Democratic and Republican officials. It also prompted an angry retort from a 
senior White House official, who said, as did the others, that Brown had 
violated the most important rule of campaign expenditures: Make sure to have 
money at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clint Reilly (Brown's campaign manager) should be tried for malpractice," 
said one Clinton Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly, in a telephone interview, said the campaign did not have enough money 
to pay for both television time and a get-out-the-vote effort that it considers 
crucial to Tuesday's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is no money, I can't buy the time," said Reilly, who added that the 
campaign had been struggling to raise capital in the face of a fierce barrage 
of ads from Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign officials downplayed the impact of their decision not to air 
ads over the weekend, saying the $150,000 or so worth of ads that would have 
been aired did not amount to much, given the millions of dollars the campaign 
has already spent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign has announced that it intends to air two commercials 
Monday, the day before the election, which will criticize Wilson's views on 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader political world, the decision to forgo advertising the weekend 
before the election was seen as, at best, a public relations disaster. 
Democrats and Republicans alike said the signal it sent was that either the 
campaign had grossly mismanaged its resources or that Brown was unwilling to go 
the final mile -- or into debt -- on behalf of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, political veterans on both sides said, a campaign marshals its 
resources from Election Day backward, making sure that it has enough money left 
to bombard the airwaves at the end of the race when voters are paying more 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to run out of money before you run out of campaign," said 
Darry Sragow, a veteran Democratic strategist currently running Democratic Rep. 
Richard Lehman's reelection campaign in the San Joaquin Valley. "You have a 
certain obligation to the rest of the ticket, to your own supporters, to people 
who gave you money, who put their personal credentials on the line in the form 
of endorsements, and an obligation to your own career to make it clear that you 
fought to the bitter end." 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow said any difficulties on the part of the candidate at the top of the 
ticket can filter down to affect other races, such as his candidate's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need every single vote that we can get," said Sragow, who emphasized that 
he was not placing blame on anyone in particular. "If in any way this 
demoralizes Democrats, it could indeed cost us this House seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign officials were, of course, thrilled at Brown's financial 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like running in the Indy 500 and pulling up short after 498," said Larry 
Thomas, a senior adviser to the governor's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Brown campaign official made it clear that, even if Brown had had 
enough money to buy ads over the weekend, the effort would have been fairly 
small. 
</P>
<P>
 According to this official, Brown in the last two weeks of the campaign has 
spent $700,000 in television time, while Wilson purchased about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign officials said the numbers were roughly accurate, but added 
that the difference was largely caused by Brown's low level of spending. Wilson 
was spending at roughly the same rate as Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, one 
said, and both were outspending Brown by a 3-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has not lacked money throughout the campaign. According to finance 
reports, she has raised and spent about $24 million, more than any other 
Democratic statewide candidate in history. 
</P>
<P>
 And earlier in the campaign, Brown was outspending Wilson on television. 
According to figures compiled by the Wilson camp from campaign expenditure 
reports, Brown spent $6.5 million on television ads between Jan. 1 and Labor 
Day. During the same period, Wilson spent $5.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign officials emphasized Saturday that they do not believe the 
financial problem will affect the outcome. Indeed, the candidate on Saturday 
was buoyant. In Oakland, where she and Clinton both addressed an applauding 
crowd, Brown described Wilson as a "leader with no guts." 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187 is about dividing us in California based upon the color of 
our skin, based upon what our last names might be, based upon whether we have 
an accent or not," she said. "Proposition 187 is about discrimination, and 
there is no two ways about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spent his day aboard a chartered Boeing 737 with much of the GOP 
ticket, traveling from Chico south through the Central Valley to Bakersfield. 
The governor focused most directly on illegal immigration and what he contended 
was Clinton's unwillingness to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He also tried to turn the tables on Democrats and Proposition 187 opponents 
who have accused Wilson of divisive, racially insensitive politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "In their desperation, they have sought to turn Californian against 
Californian," he said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; FEINSTEIN, HUFFINGTON SLUGGING OUT FINAL

 As America's most expensive congressional race in history headed into its 
final weekend, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Republican challenger Mike Huffington 
jabbed at each other Saturday while concentrating on making sure their core 
supporters vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein urged on Democrats in Santa Monica, West Hollywood and Van Nuys. 
Huffington met with Republican groups in Orange County, San Diego, Palm Springs 
and Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein launched a blitz on the state's television screens, broadcasting 
three new commercials backed with an advertising budget for the final week of 
more than $1.5 million. Still, Huffington's unprecedented $28-million campaign 
was expected to continue outspending the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have got to win this election," Feinstein told her supporters. "I have won 
and I have lost elections. I have never felt it was so important, that the 
integrity of the whole process was more at stake, than it is in this election. 
That a United States Senate seat could be bought by someone who I am convinced 
cares not one whit about the people or California would be terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) reminded his troops in San Diego how far 
they have come. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were 30 points behind, what they call an unwinnable race," the candidate 
said. "Now we are in a statistical dead heat and we need for you to get out and 
vote and to call 10 people you know and get them to vote on Election Day." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to showing that the race is very close, recent polls indicate that 
Huffington and Feinstein have pounded each other so much that neither can claim 
to be liked by even half of the state's voters. Political analysts say an 
unusually large portion of the electorate remains undecided in the Senate race 
because they are disgusted with both of their choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot is that experts believe the winner may well receive less than 50% 
of the vote, which has happened only twice in the last 60 years of California 
U.S. Senate races -- with Barbara Boxer in 1992 and Alan Cranston in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 As the candidates stumped for votes in the Southland, both campaign 
headquarters were also furious with activity. Among the developments Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Feinstein's three new television commercials included one attacking her 
opponent, another comparing their records of accomplishment in Washington and a 
third -- only to be shown on cable television channels -- that highlights the 
senator's endorsement by eight newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 One ad attacks Huffington for admitting recently that he violated federal law 
by employing an illegal immigrant nanny for more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein employed a housekeeper from Guatemala for about three years, ending 
in 1983. The senator has maintained that she did nothing improper because when 
the woman was hired she showed documents indicating she was in the country 
legally. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, officials from the Immigration and Naturalization Service said the 
housekeeper entered the country legally but her visa only allowed her to work 
at the Guatemalan Consulate and even that permission expired while she worked 
for Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator's campaign has said that Feinstein's case is different from 
Huffington's employment of an illegal immigrant nanny until last year because a 
1986 federal law made such hiring a crime. Huffington has blamed his wife for 
the hiring decision but conceded that federal immigration and tax laws were 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has shown records demonstrating that she paid taxes and Social 
Security on her employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congressman Huffington admits he broke federal immigration law," the ad says. 
"Dianne Feinstein broke no federal immigration laws." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Republican campaign released a letter Saturday from Sen. Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) asking why the INS is not investigating Huffington's charge that a 
Santa Barbara reporter approached his former nanny and claimed to be a 
Feinstein campaign operative. The Huffington campaign contends that the 
reporter, who has denied the allegation, offered the nanny a green card if she 
would talk about her work at the Huffington household. 
</P>
<P>
 * Huffington officials also produced a 1988 letter that appeared to be written 
by Feinstein as she tried to help her former housekeeper, Anabella Piaz, gain 
permanent residency in the United States. The campaign said the letter 
indicates Feinstein knew of her housekeeper's illegal status because it says, 
"Anabella's immigration status has been somewhat mixed up during the years." 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein officials said the letter does not contradict what the senator 
has said all along, that she believed her housekeeper had permission to be in 
the country when she was hired. On the campaign trail, Feinstein said, "When I 
hired this person in 1980, she submitted to me documentation which I believed 
was correct. I have broken no laws. Mr. Huffington has. What he is doing . . . 
is kind of a last-ditch, desperation effort." 
</P>
<P>
 * Feinstein's campaign released its own letter from a fellow congressman on 
Saturday in which Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) complained to Huffington that one of 
his campaign mailers is misleading. Kerrey charged that a photograph in the 
mailer of the candidate's father wearing a Navy uniform was intended to imply 
that the candidate is a military veteran even though he has no service record. 
</P>
<P>
 "This deceit is an insult to every veteran who has served this country," said 
Kerrey, who won the Medal of Honor as a Navy SEAL in Vietnam. "For you to imply 
that you have served in our country's military when you did not is shameful." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's day began in Orange County, where the candidate attended a 
breakfast rally with the fan club of conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington told the audience of about 160 people that he favored reduced 
government regulation, a cut in capital gains taxes and increased defense 
spending. Then he charged that his opponent cast votes in Congress to benefit 
her husband's business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine a senator voting to enrich themselves?" he said to a roar of 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, the ballot measure that would bar illegal immigrants from 
public education and non-emergency health care benefits, was also a popular 
target for the gathering. Bob Forsberg, chapter president of a Rush Limbaugh 
fan club, set the tone for the appearance with a joke that referred to 
Proposition 187 supporters as "low riders." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people who are against Proposition 187 who are down at the 
bottom of the road," Forsberg said. "They would like to come up here, but the 
low-riders can't get over the speed bumps." 
</P>
<P>
 When Huffington spoke later, he endorsed Forsberg's campaign for City Council 
in Lake Forest. "'We have to elect politicians -- whether it is Bob (Forsberg) 
or (Newport Beach Assemblyman) Gil Ferguson or anyone else who is running -- 
who will tell the truth," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also returned to a favorite theme in recent days -- that the 
"liberal" media, and the Los Angeles Times in particular, favor Feinstein and 
are trying to block stories about her employment of the housekeeper. He called 
the paper's coverage of the issue "a cover-up." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what we are up against, the liberal media," Huffington said. "You 
know something, thank God for Rush Limbaugh! This man is telling the truth and 
thank God someone is willing to stand up and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein skipped an appearance Saturday with President Clinton in Oakland as 
campaign officials decided instead to focus the senator's attention on the key 
battleground of Southern California. Feinstein has already appeared with the 
president four times during her campaign, including two events in Los Angeles 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein attended rallies for her supporters in West Hollywood, Santa Monica 
and the San Fernando Valley. When she accepted a giant greeting card signed by 
dozens of supporters, Feinstein emotionally thanked the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of grief in what I do," she said, wiping at her eyes. "This is 
one of the nicest moments I've had in this entire campaign. When you work hard 
you really don't expect that anybody is going to say, 'Thank you.' And suddenly 
when they do, you find that it's a very, very emotional experience."

OLD STREET LIGHTS BECOME 'FISHING POLES'; OCEANS: UTILITY COMPANY DONATES 350 
TONS OF CONCRETE FIXTURES TO CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL REEF TO LURE SPORT FISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 350 tons of concrete light poles yanked from streets throughout Los 
Angeles and Orange counties were carried by barge from Long Beach to a point 4 
1/2 miles off Bolsa Chica State Beach on Saturday and dumped to the bottom of 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the first of about 3,500 tons of poles, removed by Southern 
California Edison in a street light modernization program, that over the next 
12 months will create a substantial addition to an artificial reef being 
constructed by Southland sport fishermen who are determined to revitalize the 
fish population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fishing used to be great in Southern California and has been terrible in 
recent years and is getting worse," said Jim Paulk, a Huntington Beach resident 
who is president of United Anglers of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The thinning of the local fisheries, Paulk said, has been attributed to many 
factors, including overfishing, pollution and the loss of wetlands to 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison's discarded light poles, which otherwise would have been destined for 
landfills, will be scattered like pickup sticks on the ocean floor. Marine 
biologists say the poles will provide excellent footing for plants and 
barnacles, niches where tiny fish can hide and grow. The reef also will attract 
larger fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a year (the concrete poles) will be teeming with life that will become 
more and more complex with time, and in 10 to 15 years it will be 
indistinguishable from a natural reef," said Dennis Bedford, a marine biologist 
for the California Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides raising tens of thousands of dollars to help fund construction of the 
Bolsa Chica Artificial Reef, United Anglers and its affiliate clubs over the 
last two years have been financing, building and operating facilities to raise 
white sea bass, a tasty and popular sporting fish that has sharply declined in 
Southern California waters over the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny white sea bass are kept in an underwater pen in Newport Harbor and fed by 
volunteers from the Balboa Angling Club. The containment is designed to protect 
them from birds, sea lions and other predators. Officials of another club, the 
Dana Angling Club, said that within a week they will complete construction of 
another facility and place it in Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 These and similar protective pens that fishermen have placed in Marina del 
Rey, Oxnard, Catalina and Redondo Beach will grow fish that have been bred from 
brood stock at Hubbs-Sea World Research Institute in San Diego. And there are 
plans for more, Paulk said, including two pens in Huntington Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say sport fishermen are playing a valuable role in the white 
sea bass replenishment effort. "The sport fishermen have supported this program 
from the very beginning and without them this would not have happened," said 
Michael Domeier, head of Fish and Game's sport fish research group, which is 
monitoring the effectiveness of the artificial breeding program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the first time on the West Coast that local ocean fish populations have 
been enhanced by artificial means," said Bob Denault, a hardware store chain 
executive and president of the Dana Angling Club. 
</P>
<P>
 White sea bass take five years to reach the length of 28 inches required for 
legal fishing, so it will take time for local fishermen to see an improvement 
in their sea bass catch. "It will probably be the year 2000 before we see any 
significant return on this part of the investment," Paulk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Great patience and perseverance have also been required to create the Bolsa 
Chica Artificial Reef, said Russ Izor, a veteran sport fishing boat owner from 
Torrance who is considered the father of the reef. 
</P>
<P>
 Izor said that a decade ago he won a struggle to obtain approval of the 
project from the U.S. Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers and California 
Coastal Commission. Construction of the reef began in 1986, with an initial 
deposit of 5,000 tons of concrete highway rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has not only provided an amazing amount of recreational fishing for people 
from Newport Beach to San Pedro, but it has also provided a habitat for big 
families of fish who were wandering in a void," Izor said. "A fishery needs a 
place to hang their hat like anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa Chica reef is part of a system of 35 artificial reefs that since the 
1950s have been built to promote sporting fish, said Bedford of the Fish and 
Game Department. "A lot of very popular fish for sport fishing are associated 
with rocky habitat where they may hide, reproduce or feed," depending on the 
species, he said. Artificial reefs have been created in Orange County off the 
coasts of Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The placement of these reefs is strategically significant, he said, because 
there is no naturally occurring rocky coastline between the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula and Laguna Beach and "there is a tremendous amount of fishing 
pressure" from Southern California sport fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists argue that artificial reefs serve mostly to attract fish to a 
particular spot -- thus making them easier for fishermen to catch -- and do 
nothing to help the fish population grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gordon LaBedz, chairman of the environmental issues team of the Surfriders 
Foundation, a national environmental group based in San Clemente, said that 
although the foundation does not oppose building artificial reefs, the group 
believes "it is something that needs more science. . . . We would like more 
knowledge on this issue before they line our coast with what is essentially 
garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 David Parker, a marine biologist who supervises Fish and Game's artificial 
reef project, said the department has begun studies at Southern California's 
artificial reefs "to further document and quantify the contribution to (fish) 
productivity the reefs make." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fish and Game officials believe the reefs benefit the fish and other 
marine life. Izor said that over the last eight years the Bolsa Chica reef, 
located 85 feet to 100 feet below the ocean's surface, has attracted kelp bass, 
sand bass, sheep head and sculpin, all popular sport fish. Bedford said the 
older parts of the reef also boast a substantial colony of gorgonians, which he 
described as fan-shaped soft corals, and blacksmith fish, a plankton-eating 
fish that in turn is a favorite food of many sport fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The reef has gradually expanded with various additions of rubble, including 
1,000 tons of manufacturer-rejected concrete fireplaces in 1992 and another 
1,000 tons of concrete in August. Currently, Izor said, the 45-acre reef site, 
with capacity for about 40,000 tons of concrete, is only about a third full. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, United Anglers has collected $30,000 of the $40,000 required to pay 
for transporting all of the 7,500 Southern California Edison poles that will be 
donated over the next year, Paulk said. The funds have been contributed by 
Southern California Edison, Ameron Pole Products, the contractor removing the 
poles, and fishing clubs and individuals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said another 20,000 to 25,000 tons of concrete will have to be donated to 
finish building the reef and another $200,000 will have to be raised to pay for 
barging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dream is to have a great fishing destination for anglers off of 
Huntington Beach," said Paulk.

BOSNIA FIGHTING ESCALATES AS SERBS RETAKE LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rival armies fought pitched battles in northwest Bosnia on Saturday as rebel 
Serbs appeared to be regaining some territory recently lost to a successful 
Muslim offensive, U.N. officials and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations said the two sides were fighting for the northwestern town 
of Bosanska Krupa, and government troops were preparing to push on with their 
successful offensive in central Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Protection Force said Bosanska Krupa, on the edge of the Muslim-held 
Bihac pocket, was being fiercely defended by units of the Bosnian Serb army. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think there must be a lot of casualties, and the town will not be easy for 
the Bosnian government army to capture," U.N. spokesman Maj. Herve Gourmelon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim troops have been trying to capture the town since launching an 
offensive 10 days ago that has driven Serb forces into retreat in northwest and 
central Bosnia and southwest of Sarajevo. They have taken more than 100 square 
miles of territory. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Reuters television crew in the northwestern Bihac pocket said the 
Bosnian Serbs were recapturing land from government forces and confirmed rebel 
Serb reports that they had managed to retake Kulen Vakuf. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the United Nations, the Muslims were meeting little resistance 
southwest of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, in their attempts to advance on 
Trnovo and to cut a vital supply road between rebel Serb territory in east and 
southeast Bosnia.

YELTSIN PROMOTES REFORMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin promoted a leading reformer Saturday and 
gave him broad powers to shape economic policy after a shake-up that prompted 
speculation he was putting the brakes on reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion of Anatoly Chubais, a lone holdover from Russia's original team 
of radical reformers, to first deputy prime minister appeared to be Yeltsin's 
answer to liberal critics. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gives the government's harsh 1995 budget proposal a strong advocate to 
steer it through a restive Parliament. Billions of dollars in international 
loans and credits that could make or break Russia's reforms hinge on the 
government adhering to a strict anti-inflationary path. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman of the State Property Committee and deputy premier since 1991, 
Chubais, 39, has directed Russia's privatization program. He said his top 
priority is to ensure passage of the reform-oriented budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion makes Chubais one of two first deputy prime ministers, along 
with Oleg Soskovets.

PUSH FOR PARTIAL EUROPE UNION RAISES IRE; DIPLOMACY: GERMANS SUGGEST THOSE THAT 
ARE READY PROCEED WITH JOINT POLICY. OTHER NATIONS PROTEST AFFRONT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It has been weeks since the latest salvos were fired in the debate about how 
best to move forward with the job of uniting Europe, but echoes continue to 
reverberate through the corridors of Continental power. 
</P>
<P>
 The noise is likely to grow only louder in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of German members of Parliament headed by two of Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl's closest confidants caused the biggest stir by detailing publicly what 
even the most ardent advocates of closer European integration have been saying 
in private -- that a core of economically strong, politically committed 
European Union countries should move toward full monetary and political union, 
leaving the door open for others to join when they are ready and willing. 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity of the reaction to the Germans' proposal is based in part on the 
lawmakers involved -- they are respected, influential and close to Kohl's 
thinking; they include his possible successor, Wolfgang Schaeuble. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Germans also caused a stir because they named the countries they 
believe should belong to the core: Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium 
and Luxembourg. Those left out, especially larger countries such as Italy, 
Spain and Britain, reacted to what they considered a major affront. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi telephoned Kohl to complain, and 
British Prime Minister John Major said in a speech that he "recoiled from ideas 
of a union in which some would be more equal than others." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the German idea was floated only days after French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur advocated in more diplomatic language a similar plan, some 
worry that Bonn and Paris may be trying to hijack the integration process for 
their own ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always some mistrust of larger countries, and this hasn't helped, but 
how else can one manage a union of 20 nations?" asked Bernard van Praag, 
director of Amsterdam University's Institute for Economic Research. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate is important because it unfolds as the 12-nation European Union 
prepares for a major review of the Maastricht Treaty, which commits the members 
to monetary and political union by the decade's end. 
</P>
<P>
 While the review is not scheduled to occur until 1996, the issues are so basic 
to the Continent's future that they have been discussed virtually since the 
treaty took force last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the discussion is growing more intense. "This debate is forcing people to 
come to grips with the fundamental issue of what kind of Europe we are going to 
have," said Susie Symes, who heads the European program at the Royal Institute 
of International Affairs in London. "Is there going to be a two-speed Europe? 
Is there going to be a core group? There is a great deal of realistic thinking 
going on now." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of a "two-speed Europe," an idea viewed as heresy among advocates of 
integration only a few years ago, has been pushed to the fore by compelling 
realities, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * The EU is rapidly enlarging, with membership coming to at least 14 and 
possibly 16 states by January and potentially to 20 by the decade's end, when 
Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic hope to join. 
</P>
<P>
 * The large differences in social, political and economic development between 
nations such as Germany and Greece or Slovakia pose significant risks to the 
creation of a viable monetary and political union. The impact of Germany's 1990 
currency union on the weaker eastern region has heightened the awareness of 
these dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 * It is increasingly clear that only a handful of countries are expected to 
meet the tough fiscal criteria needed to qualify for monetary union; only 
Luxembourg and Ireland qualify, although some others, including Germany and 
France, are expected to meet the standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The creation of a core group is not an end in itself," the German lawmakers 
stressed in a collective statement, "but a way to counter centrifugal forces 
and keep to the undisputed goals of expansion and deeper integration." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of a "multiple-speed Europe" claim that it flies in the face of the 
underlying political principle of equality, a principle that drove the fathers 
of European unity.

ARGENTINA CRACKS DOWN ON THE UNDOCUMENTED; LATIN AMERICA: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
USED TO FIND WORK EASILY. BUT HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT IS RESTRICTING 'FALSE 
TOURISTS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was always easy for "false tourists" from neighboring nations to come here 
as if on a holiday, then stay to work and even settle permanently. Hundreds of 
thousands of Paraguayans, Bolivians, Chileans and Uruguayans have made that 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
 In an amnesty for illegal immigrants that ended early this year, 230,000 of 
them won the right to stay legally. And thousands more keep coming every month. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the United States is North America's magnet for illegal immigrants, 
Argentina is the South American hot spot for falsos turistas. But now, although 
they still don't face as many hurdles as do undocumented workers in the United 
States, false tourists are having a harder time in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 With record unemployment of 10% in Argentina, undocumented workers have become 
increasingly controversial, and authorities have been under pressure to crack 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Riveno, who came as a false tourist three years ago, ended up on the 
outskirts of Buenos Aires in a slum of dirt streets and ramshackle houses 
called Esperanza, which means hope . He found a job in a factory that makes 
brass fittings and settled his wife and three children in a tiny brick house 
with two rooms that he bought for $650, a little more than his monthly wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Riveno, 25, started his legalization process under the recent amnesty. But he 
is having trouble getting through all the red tape required for an Argentine 
resident's card, which his factory boss wants to see. The boss is under 
pressure from tax inspectors to provide documentation for all workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't say he would fire me, but he was in a fix and needed the document," 
Riveno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riveno and his boss are feeling the pinch as Argentina grapples with illegal 
immigration. It isn't exactly a full-scale crackdown. But with new measures, 
authorities intend not only to make it more difficult for undocumented workers 
to cross the border but also to reduce their incentive to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The main lure is jobs, so that is the primary area where the government is 
tightening the screws. Aldo Carreras, secretary for population and community 
relations in the Interior Ministry, said the government's objective is to 
eliminate a "labor black market." 
</P>
<P>
 Tax inspectors have begun asking companies to show a resident identification 
number, or at least a preliminary registration certificate for foreigners, for 
each person on their payrolls. Revenue agents will now do double duty, Carreras 
said in an interview, noting, "They are also going to be immigration 
inspectors." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the new measures, employers are growing reluctant to offer jobs to 
undocumented workers, Carreras said. He predicted that their reluctance will 
increase when Congress passes a bill that authorizes the government to fine 
employers $5,000 for each undocumented worker they employ. The bill has been 
approved by the lower house and is expected to win Senate approval soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Gurrieri, national director of immigration, said his service is 
implementing new checks to detect false tourists coming across Argentina's 
northern border with Bolivia and Paraguay. Immigration officers, for example, 
have begun asking to see tourists' round-trip tickets, the money they will 
spend during their stay and proof of their employment in their home countries. 
Still, he said, "it's difficult to think of a strict control at the border." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1950s, Argentina and its neighbors have agreed that their citizens 
may cross the borders with no passport or visa, only a national identification 
card. To reverse that policy now, when Argentina is promoting economic 
integration with its neighbors, would be disruptive, Gurrieri said. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if national policy called for a wide-scale crackdown, Gurrieri and 
other experts agree that migrants would find ways to get in. 
</P>
<P>
 A major difference between U.S. and Argentine policy toward illegal immigrants 
is that Argentina rarely deports undocumented foreigners unless they are 
involved in illicit activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants who have job contracts are eligible to apply for permanent 
residence; between 10,000 and 30,000 people a year receive resident status that 
way. Such applications, plus two amnesties, have given legal status to about 
600,000 undocumented workers since 1980, the immigration service says. 
</P>
<P>
 A new regulation prohibits employers from putting an undocumented immigrant to 
work before he or she has begun the legalization process and received a 
registration certificate, which can take weeks or months. And with today's high 
unemployment, fewer companies are willing to offer a contract to someone who 
can't work immediately, Gurrieri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Farina, a lay leader in a Paraguayan Roman Catholic mission that works 
with immigrants in Argentina, said such regulations are a subtle way to squeeze 
out undocumented workers. "It's a game they are playing to repress, to 
restrict, in an elegant way," he said. "It appears as if there is an open-door 
policy, but it is hard to get in through that door." 
</P>
<P>
 In his office on a shady street, Farina introduced Norma Fretes, a young 
Paraguayan who came to Argentina as a false tourist and found a job as a 
domestic. After she asked the woman who hired her for a work contract, Fretes 
was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "She scolded me and put me out on the street," Fretes said. Farina noted, "The 
patrona doesn't want to get into this mess of making a contract with an 
illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated that there are 800,000 Paraguayans living in Argentina, half 
illegally. Estimates of the total number of illegal immigrants in Argentina 
range from 400,000 to more than 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In this nation of 33 million people, illegal immigration has rarely reached 
such proportions that it has burdened services such as public health care and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 While children, theoretically, must possess an Argentine ID card to enroll in 
public schools, administrators usually overlook the requirement, "understanding 
that all children have a right to education," Gurrieri said. "If they don't let 
them in the school, they are going to be on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Diaz Pereira, the diplomat in charge of the Paraguayan Embassy in Buenos 
Aires, said illegal immigrants have full access to Argentine social services. 
"We have not had complaints of discrimination against our citizens, even the 
illegal ones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivian Ambassador Luis Lema said Argentina "has been generous in the case of 
undocumented people, with social services such as health. I don't know of any 
discrimination for getting into schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina is a nation of immigrants. In the late 19th Century and early 20th 
Century, great waves of people from Italy and Spain surged into the country and 
helped make it the most prosperous in South America. In recent decades, most 
immigrants have come from neighboring countries. Many have moved here to escape 
harsh military regimes, but most have come for low-skill jobs in agriculture, 
services, industry and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In Argentina today, a domestic can earn $600 a month, compared with as little 
as $50 a month for farm or domestic labor in Paraguay and Bolivia, two of the 
poorest countries in South America -- and the two that send the most false 
tourists to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, immigrants were welcome because most of them filled jobs that 
Argentines disdained. But high unemployment has forced many Argentines to lower 
their sights. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are willing to accept work in any conditions," said Silvia Montoya, an 
official with a group that helps immigrants. Suddenly, undocumented immigrants 
are competing with Argentines, Montoya said. "And suddenly, there is opposition 
to them by all these unions." 
</P>
<P>
 Lelio Marmora, chief of the International Organization for Migration in Buenos 
Aires, disagreed. He insisted that Argentines still generally reject low-paying 
or short-term jobs illegal workers get and that foreigners are being used as 
scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
 He said trying to keep illegal immigrants out is futile if they can't make a 
decent living at home. "The more repression there is with illegal immigration, 
the more illegality there is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only solution, Marmora said, is economic development that will raise wages 
in neighboring countries. Argentina's policy of seeking free trade and economic 
integration with its neighbors is on the right track because it will tend to 
equalize labor conditions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, said Alfredo Agulleiro, secretary of social promotion for Buenos 
Aires, illegal immigrants are swelling slums in the metropolitan area. Many 
join takeovers of vacant land and buildings, and increasing numbers are 
occupying sidewalks as street vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Agulleiro's solution? His department helps poor immigrant families find 
housing and social services. It even assists them with the paperwork to become 
legal residents. "There are social workers to do that exclusively," he said. 
"It isn't like the United States. Things are open here."

HUNDREDS JOIN WITH FAMILY TO MOURN 2 SLAIN SOUTH CAROLINA BROTHERS; TRAGEDY: 
EVEN THOSE WHO NEVER KNEW THE CHILDREN COME TO SAY GOODBY. IN HER JAIL CELL, 
THEIR MOTHER IS UNDER A SUICIDE WATCH.

<P>
 Relatives and strangers filed through a flower-filled funeral home Saturday 
night, mourning in whispers over the single closed coffin that held two little 
boys who police allege were drowned by their mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Their father, David Smith, stood rubbing the coffin and touching a picture of 
his sons. His family sat in pews with relatives of the boys' mother, Susan 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Smith, 23, was in prison near Columbia, charged with murdering 3-year-old 
Michael and 14-month-old Alex. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the hundreds of mourners sobbed and hugged in the funeral home's 
parking lot after the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxanne and Michael Toney never met the Smiths, but they drove two hours from 
Anderson to say goodby to the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just couldn't get no peace until we came," said Michael, holding his 
2-year-old boy. Earlier they placed flowers at Lake John D. Long, where police 
divers found the car that Mrs. Smith said had been taken by a man with a gun. 
The two boys were still buckled in their car seats when it was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Flower arrangements came from around the nation, offering Bible references and 
tender messages to the "precious little ones." Grieving townspeople replaced 
yellow ribbons of hope with blue ribbons of remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not stopped crying. I feel like if I could just get up on top of a 
hill and scream, maybe I'd be all right. But it's going to be a long time," 
said Joyce Bobo as she tied another bow. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, David Smith visited the grocery store where he was 
employed to meet with co-workers. Later, in a TV interview as he walked 
downtown, Smith thanked everyone for their support, but he would not comment on 
whether he ever had suspected his estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a long time to get back into the groove of things, but I 
will," he told CBS News. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Smith was held in isolation at the Women's Correctional Center near 
Columbia under a suicide watch. She was visited Saturday by her lawyer and a 
psychologist, prison spokeswoman Robyn Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has not been allowed other visitors. Ordinarily, she would be allowed to 
exercise each day, but because she is under the suicide watch she is confined 
to her cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Smith was charged Thursday with two counts of murder. She had maintained 
for nine days that her sons were abducted in the carjacking and she made 
tearful pleas on national television for the boys' safe return. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators reported she confessed, saying she killed her sons after a 
boyfriend said he was ending their relationship, partly because he did not want 
to take on the job of raising them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her whole world was crashing," a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith took two polygraph tests during those nine days and failed both. One of 
the key questions on which Smith showed deception was when she was asked if she 
knew where her children were, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Moss peered through teary eyes down the boat ramp where authorities say 
Smith put her car in drive and let it roll into the lake, her sons still 
strapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know that she could see the back of the heads of those children, if she 
looked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek, citing Smith's confession, reports in its Nov. 14 issue that she 
told authorities she stood at the water's edge and watched as Michael woke up 
and struggled to get free before the car flipped and sank. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one of her lawyers later told Reuters he had no knowledge of Smith 
telling police she watched her son die. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith filed for divorce a month ago. On Friday, Tom Findlay acknowledged he 
broke off a relationship with her just a week before the children were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not ready to assume the important responsibilities of being a father," 
he said, adding that that was not the only reason for the breakup. Findlay was 
not a suspect, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their funeral was set for today.

PATAKI SHOUTED DOWN OUTSIDE N.Y. GOVERNOR'S MANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican George Pataki was forced to abandon a campaign appearance in front 
of the Executive Mansion Saturday after he was shouted down by rowdy supporters 
of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 of the Pataki faithful were greeted by more than 200 shouting Cuomo 
supporters, many of them state workers. The rally got raucous as the two sides 
shoved each other and traded jeers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police closed off the street to the mansion for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mario Cuomo has been talking for 12 years. His people won't let me talk for 
12 minutes," Pataki tried to yell above the din. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a person was knocked to the ground, prompting one man to shout 
on his bullhorn: "It's only politics! Relax!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be intimidated by Mario's professional political agitators," Pataki 
shouted to his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes, Pataki left the rally surrounded by supporters chanting: 
"Three more days!" The Cuomo crowd also followed, shouting: "Cuomo! Cuomo!" 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Pataki said the incident was "very unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 "They know we are surging . . . and they don't want the people of this state 
to hear my ideas," the first-term state senator said. "It was an organized 
effort to prevent me from exercising my right to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo campaigned in New York City. Independence candidate Tom Golisano got a 
boost Saturday with an endorsement from Ross Perot, who attended a news 
conference with Golisano. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two polls released Saturday show Cuomo with a 6 or 7 percentage 
point lead over Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Daily News/WNBC-TV survey, 48% of the voters favored Cuomo and 41% said 
they would vote for Pataki. Golisano got 5%, Right-to-Life candidate Robert 
Walsh 1%, and 5% were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone poll of 648 registered voters was conducted by Lewis Harris & 
Associates between Oct. 31 and last Friday. The margin of error is plus or 
minus 3.8 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 A New York 1 NewsPoll also has Cuomo ahead of Pataki, 46% to 40%, with 
Golisano pulling in 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone poll by the cable TV news network of 770 voters was conducted 
Nov. 1-4. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.

RUNAWAY, 16, CALLS TO SAY HE DOES NOT WANT CANCER DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine days after running away from home because of painful cancer treatments, 
16-year-old Billy Best called his parents from Texas to say he's OK. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he's not ready to come home, that he needs more time to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he still feels like (the medication) is killing him and he doesn't 
want to do it," Billy's father, William, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The call from Billy late Friday, and two calls early Saturday from people he 
met on his trip, helped unravel the mystery of his whereabouts since he ran 
away Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks earlier, the high school junior was told that the chemical and 
radiation treatments for his cancer, Hodgkin's disease, would have to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I left is because I could not stand going to the hospital every 
week," Billy wrote in a note he left for his parents. "I feel like the medicine 
is killing me instead of helping me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgkin's disease is a cancer of the body's lymphatic system, which is used to 
fight infection. While the disease is fatal if untreated, doctors say that up 
to 80% of its victims are deemed cancer-free if they undergo full chemical and 
radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Cliff Takemoto, who had been treating Billy, said that without continued 
treatments, Billy's cancer would worsen. But he also said the treatment can be 
modified.

PARATROOPER WHO LOST LEGS JUMPS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A soldier who lost both legs in a parachuting accident astounded even the most 
gung-ho of the gung-ho when he re-enlisted for active duty, then jumped out of 
a plane again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. 1st Class Dana Bowman took his oath Friday in a yellow and black airplane 
belonging to the Golden Knights parachute team at the base that is home to the 
Army's elite 82nd Airborne Division and the Green Berets. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the 32-year-old Ohio man shoved himself out the door, 10,000 feet up, and 
followed his comrades to the ground, nearly nine months after losing his legs 
in the accident that left a friend dead. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bowman landed, the wind ruffled his pants, exposing his metal legs. He 
took a few steps, sat down and helped himself up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I did it," Bowman said after receiving kudos from a colonel and a 
three-star general at a ceremony. "I'm just glad to be here standing on my 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman is the first double amputee to re-enlist and remain on active duty in 
the U.S. military, said Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, commander of the 18th Airborne 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman has been reassigned to the Golden Knights and may return to performing 
with the team, base spokesman Gene Sexton said. His drive and determination 
left no doubt the military would take him back, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you can run two miles in less than 13 minutes on those legs, I don't 
think you're too disabled," Sexton said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman was eligible for 100% disability and could have quit the Army he had 
served for 13 years and drawn monthly checks for the rest of his life, Shelton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 6, Bowman collided in the air at more than 100 m.p.h. with partner and 
friend Sgt. Jose Aquillon. Bowman's legs were severed, one above the knee and 
one below. Aquillon died of a heart attack after landing in a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me at the beginning it would be six weeks before I would get off my 
crutches," Bowman said. "It took me four days to get off my crutches. It took 
me a week to get off my cane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the fastest way to get my balance back is to get rid of the cane. 
If I fall, I fall. I've had some good ones too. I broke a lot of (artificial) 
legs."

OZONE MONITOR ABOARD SPACE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They cooled it down, then warmed it up. They turned it off and on, again and 
again. Nothing worked -- a German ozone monitor flying on the space shuttle 
Atlantis refused to collect data despite ground controllers' coaxing. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers were not giving up, but they held out little hope Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically speaking, we feel that there is very little chance of obtaining 
any more science data," said Gerd Hartmann, a German scientist in charge of the 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 All the other atmospheric and solar-energy monitors aboard Atlantis, as well 
as those on a satellite released by the astronauts, were working well. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the ozone instrument began Friday when the data link between 
it and ground controllers was lost, apparently because of a computer 
malfunction. The monitor had worked fine when it was turned on Thursday, just 
hours after Atlantis rocketed into its 190-mile-high orbit, and collected six 
hours of high-quality data. 
</P>
<P>
 A sudden surge of current in the instrument's electronics may have burned out 
one or more components, Hartmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Controllers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., turned 
the monitor off for 1 1/2 hours while it was facing away from the sun to cool 
the system and get it working. When that failed, they turned the instrument off 
while it was facing the sun to heat the system. That didn't work either. 
</P>
<P>
 More of the same was planned. There was little else controllers could do 
because they could not communicate with the monitor's computer, Hartmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third time in 2 1/2 years that the ozone monitor has flown on a 
space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 The instrument was supposed to measure the distribution of water vapor, 
chlorine monoxide and ozone between 12 miles and 60 miles high. It has a 
dish-shaped antenna to scan Earth's horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlorine monoxide is formed in the atmosphere by the breakdown of 
chlorofluorocarbons, which are used in refrigerators and air conditioners and 
are a leading cause of ozone loss. Major industrial nations have agreed to 
eliminate these chemicals by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The thin, invisible layer of ozone in the stratosphere protects against 
dangerous ultraviolet rays, which can cause skin cancer and cataracts and 
weaken immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The defective instrument is not the only ozone gauge flying on Atlantis during 
its 11-day mission. Ozone is also being analyzed by telescopes aboard the 
satellite dropped off by the astronauts Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these other instruments, however, measures chlorine monoxide. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is one piece of the puzzle that we would like to have," NASA mission 
scientist Tim Miller said. "So we are disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 After one day of free flight, the satellite's infrared telescopes had recorded 
more than 2 million spectra, or wavelength images. Scientists hope to collect 
as many as 10 million images before the six-member shuttle crew captures the 
satellite next Saturday for the trip home. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is due to end Nov. 14.

OIL AND NATIVE CULTURE FIND A WAY TO MIX IN ECUADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After fighting off outsiders for centuries, Waorani natives have set aside 
their spears and arrows to welcome a U.S. petroleum company into their remote 
rain-forest homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Texas-based Maxus Energy Corp., keeps the peace with the Waoranis 
by sponsoring community development projects, such as a school, and paying 
native men to help protect the natural environment along a new road into the 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "They work monitoring the trees, the animals, the fish, so that the road won't 
cause damage," said Toca Kaiga, a Waorani leader. Maxus employs rotating groups 
of 36 Waorani who receive about $260 a person for each 22-day work stint -- an 
attractive wage in Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiga, 22, and a crew of the workers were spending a few days here at a rustic 
guest house, provided by Maxus, before going out to work. Asked how well the 
company was preserving the environment, Kaiga responded quickly in his broken 
Spanish, "Correctly Maxus is working, without damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Such assurances do not satisfy critics. Peter Oxford, a nature photographer 
and tour guide, said the Waoranis -- who number an estimated 1,200 and still 
hunt with spears and arrows -- fail to understand that the road will carry in 
outside influences that eventually will destroy their traditional culture, even 
if the forest is preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't see into the future," Oxford said. "They see the school being 
built, and they like it. They don't realize they've sold their soul." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Maxus began developing its concession in Block 16, an area divided by 
the Yasuni River southeast of Coca. Up to 100 production wells will be drilled 
in the block, which has an estimated 220 million barrels of recoverable heavy 
oil, according to William C. Hutton, general manager of Maxus Ecuador. Hutton 
calls it the "largest heavy-oil development project in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The gravel road Maxus is building runs 85 miles through Block 16. Some Indian 
advocates fear the road will open up areas south and east of Coca for petroleum 
exploitation -- including Block 17, where Brazil's Petrobras abandoned 
exploration in 1987 after a particularly fierce Waorani group killed Roman 
Catholic missionaries who were trying to prevent violent confrontations with 
oil workers.

 Fewer than 1,000 acres will be deforested, he said. The environmental and

INSIDE THE ADS; SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington has taken out full-page newspaper 
ads in today's Los Angeles Times and in other papers. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ad: The full-page newspaper ad quotes passages and cites information 
from a Times story about Sen. Dianne Feinstein's handling of potential 
conflicts related to her personal and political finances. The point of the ad 
is to underscore Huffington's contention that Feinstein has used her position 
in the Senate to enrich her husband, merchant banker Richard C. Blum. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Analysis: The ad refers to several paragraphs of the nearly 3,000-word 
Times story that ran Oct. 28. But some of the quotes and references in the ad 
are incomplete, and, in one case, it does not cite other facts in the story 
indicating that Feinstein's actions did not violate any rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad says, for example, that two longtime clients and friends of Blum have 
connections to a San Francisco firm, Catellus Corp. The ad says Feinstein's 
original Desert Protection Act would have given Catellus special allowances to 
swap its 366,000 acres of desert land for other government surplus property. 
What the ad does not say is that after Republicans objected to the Catellus 
provision, the Senate Natural Resources Committee pulled it from the bill. The 
measure, without the Catellus provision, was later signed into law. Feinstein 
has said she took the Catellus provision directly from the House of 
Representatives' version of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad also quotes a passage from The Times' report that on May 25, "in a 
speech delivered on the Senate floor, Feinstein urges Clinton to increase 
favorable trade relations with China at the same time Blum is planning to 
invest up to $150 million there. . . ." The ad does not include the five words 
at the end of the sentence, "on behalf of several clients." Blum has said he 
would put $2 million to $5 million of his own money into the investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The story also noted that under Senate rules, Feinstein may vote on bills that 
affect her husband's finances so long as the legislation is not designed to 
specifically benefit Blum or his investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad did not mention that in some cases Feinstein has taken actions that 
adversely affected her husband's myriad investments in everything from cable 
television and an airline to container products. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has released the couple's tax returns back to their 1980 marriage, 
and has challenged Huffington to do the same. Blum released his client list in 
1990 but has declined to release his corporate returns until Huffington makes 
his tax records available. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein released three new television commercials Saturday in a 
final blitz before Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: One ad opens with a theme of the Democrat's campaign: "Who can you 
trust? Feinstein or Huffington?" An announcer then reads, "Congressman 
Huffington admits he broke federal immigration law. Dianne Feinstein broke no 
federal immigration laws." Moving to another issue, the announcer reads: 
"Congressman Huffington stiffed California for nearly $7 million in corporate 
taxes. And Huffington avoided paying millions in California income taxes by 
claiming a Texas residence. Huffington still won't release his tax returns. 
But, you know Dianne Feinstein pays her taxes because she released 17 years of 
tax returns." The ad closes: "Congressman Huffington. The Texas oil millionaire 
Californians just can't trust." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Huffington admitted recently that he violated federal 
immigration law by employing an illegal immigrant nanny at his Santa Barbara 
home for more than four years, ending last summer. He has already paid fines 
and back taxes on the woman's salary to the Internal Revenue Service, and the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service is reviewing the matter. Huffington has 
charged recently that Feinstein also employed an illegal immigrant housekeeper 
from 1980 until 1983. Feinstein said she hired a woman from Guatemala, but the 
woman produced documents indicating that she was in the country legally. INS 
officials say the housekeeper entered the country legally, but her visa only 
allowed her to work at the Guatemalan Consulate and even that permission 
expired while she worked for Feinstein. In any case, employment of an illegal 
immigrant only became a federal crime in 1986, several years after Feinstein's 
case and before Huffington's. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge that Huffington "stiffed California for nearly $7 million in 
corporate taxes" stems from a claim made by California tax authorities against 
a subsidiary of the Huffington family's former Texas oil and gas company. The 
claim was rejected by a federal judge after the subsidiary went into 
bankruptcy. The charge that Huffington avoided California income taxes stems 
from a period when the candidate and his wife claimed separate residences. 
Huffington said he did not owe California taxes until he moved to the state 
from Houston in 1991 after his family's company was sold. For several years 
previously, Huffington's wife was living at the couple's home in Santa Barbara. 
As the ad says, Huffington has declined to release his personal income taxes 
while Feinstein has allowed reporters to look at hers. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: This ad begins with a narrator reading a question, "Feinstein or 
Huffington?" It continues: "The Chronicle, The Fresno Bee, The Sacramento Bee, 
The Examiner, The Mercury News, The Tribune, The L.A. Times and newspapers all 
across California -- even congressman Huffington's own local newspaper -- all 
choose Dianne Feinstein. They call Feinstein a zealous protector of California, 
a person of substance and intelligence, a real leader and a coalition builder 
who has won friends among Democrats and Republicans." It closes: "On Tuesday, 
elect Dianne Feinstein. The California Senator Californians trust." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: The factual claims in the ad are true. Feinstein has been 
endorsed by most of the state's major newspapers. Huffington won the 
endorsement of the San Diego Union. Feinstein officials said this ad will only 
be shown on cable television channels. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: This comparison commercial begins with an announcer saying: "Dianne 
Feinstein authored and won the first ban on assault weapons. Where was 
congressman Huffington? Dianne Feinstein took on the radical right and 
protected a woman's right to choose. Where was congressman Huffington? For over 
20 years, Dianne Feinstein has had the independence to buck her own party and 
fight for the death penalty. Where was congressman Huffington? The choice is 
not just who has a record of accomplishment, it's who Californians can trust to 
fight for them. There's only one answer. Dianne Feinstein. The California 
Senator Californians can trust." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Raising abortion rights and the death penalty, this commercial 
addresses two of the most powerful issues that motivate voters. But on all of 
the issues raised in the commercial, the two candidates generally agree. 
Feinstein authored the assault weapons ban in the Senate, but Huffington also 
voted for it in the House. Like Feinstein, Huffington also supports abortion 
rights and he favors the death penalty. Feinstein has criticized her opponent's 
record on abortion rights, especially since he voted against federal funding of 
abortions for poor women.

BOTH SIDES AIR ADS ON PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Both sides of the Proposition 187 debate have been running ad campaigns about 
the initiative, which would bar illegal immigrants from receiving public school 
education, non-emergency health care and social services. Taxpayers Against 187 
is running a 30-second TV spot. Two independent groups that support Proposition 
187 -- the Washington, D.C.-based Federation for American Immigration Reform, 
and the Orange County-based California Coalition for Immigration Reform -- are 
running 60-second radio ads. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD "AGAINST": As a lengthy list of public officials and organizations 
opposing Proposition 187 streams by on the TV screen, a narrator states that 
the measure would result in a crime increase because it would lead to 300,000 
youngsters being kicked "out of school and onto the street." It goes on to say 
that the measure also does "nothing to beef up enforcement at our borders" and 
would cost California $15 billion. The ad concludes with a visual of newspaper 
headlines that refer to "ties" between Proposition 187 and a white supremacist 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Law enforcement officials including Los Angeles County Sheriff 
Sherman Block and Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams say that 
Proposition 187 could lead to increased crime problems. A nonpartisan state 
legislative analyst's report has stated that about $15 billion annually in 
federal funds for health, social service and educational programs would be 
placed at risk by Proposition 187 because it would breach federal 
confidentiality requirements. The ad does not make clear that the loss of funds 
is only a possibility. The supremacist headlines refer to allegations made by 
Taxpayers Against 187 concerning a link between measure co-author Alan Nelson, 
the Federation for American Immigration Reform (known as FAIR) and the New 
York-based Pioneer Fund, which has sponsored research by scientists who have 
held that blacks are inherently intellectually inferior to whites. That link, 
however, is decidedly tenuous. When Nelson helped write Proposition 187, he was 
working as a lobbyist for FAIR, which receives an annual contribution from the 
Pioneer Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ADS "FOR": The FAIR ad blasts the campaign tactics of Taxpayers Against 
187, which is run by Woodward & McDowell, a Burlingame-based professional 
political consulting firm. "Taxpayers Against 187 is really a slick Bay Area 
p.r. firm hired by government employees and other special interests and what 
they want from you, the real taxpayer, is an open-ended commitment to pay for 
services that like a magnet attract a never-ending flow of illegal immigrants 
to our state," the ad states. The ad by the California Coalition for 
Immigration Reform rebuts charges that the measure would turn teachers and 
doctors into immigration agents and that white supremacists are affiliated with 
the measure. "The loss of $15 billion in federal funds is a scare tactic, 
nothing more," the ad says, according to a script read to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Taxpayers Against 187, a coalition of education, health and 
law enforcement organizations opposed to the measure, is operated on a 
day-to-day basis by Woodward & McDowell. But evidence is mixed concerning 
whether educational, health and social services -- which are already limited 
for undocumented immigrants -- drive people to immigrate illegally. According 
to many experts, jobs are the leading factor. Proposition 187 does not 
specifically call for teachers or doctors to check on the immigration status of 
students and patients. But the measure does require a check of residency status 
before people can go to school or be treated in virtually all hospitals and 
health clinics. Those reasonably suspected of being illegal immigrants would be 
reported to state and federal authorities.

SCOTT HARRIS: BEWARE OF WONDER DRUG'S SIDE EFFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "It's so frustrating not to know what to do or what to think or what to tell 
your children." 
</P>
<P>
 Her tone was one of desperation, and her sentiment, no doubt, is common. The 
caller was a Northridge woman, one of several readers who phoned in response to 
a recent column appealing to Mayor Richard Riordan to announce his position on 
Proposition 187, to say whether he thinks it's good medicine or bad medicine. 
There was an unusual volume of response, from people on both sides of the 
anti-illegal immigration measure. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been an interesting couple of days and, so far, nobody's said the mayor 
should keep his mouth shut. There has been an interesting variety of views. Ted 
Bentley of Hancock Park, for example, told me I shouldn't underestimate the 
Mexican plot to recapture California. David Castro, a Mexican American, seemed 
more concerned about the Armenians in his former hometown of Glendale than the 
fate of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. And one woman who requested anonymity 
urged the media to "expose" Mayor Riordan for his abhorrent views. 
</P>
<P>
 But of all the conversations, I keep returning to Jan, Frustrated in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the other callers, Jan didn't seem certain about how she'll vote on 
Tuesday. A registered Republican, she has been planning to vote "yes" on 187, 
but her doubts have been growing. In a close election -- and 187 has been 
getting closer and closer -- it's those undecided who end up deciding. 
</P>
<P>
 A few relevant facts about Jan: First, that isn't her real name. She's a 
homemaker, the mother of two sons, one at Chatsworth High and one in junior 
high, and she's worried that the publication of her true name could put her 
family at risk. She's white, you see, and the recent student walkouts have her 
worried that the worst is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's provoking violence, is what it's doing," she said, "and somebody's going 
to get hurt. Your own children are being put on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 There are probably a lot of Jans out there. Arguments that 187 is racist don't 
impress her, because she has long prided herself on having colorblind 
attitudes. Although bigotry motivates some supporters of 187, people who argue 
that the measure equals racism may antagonize the voters, like Jan, they want 
to win over. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many people, Jan was dismayed by the display of Mexican flags at the 
protests. She watched news reports of the student walkouts and saw hostility. 
Not unlike Rodney King, she's calling on people to just get along. And at the 
root of all this anger, she sees a failure of leadership.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just personally think it is rather odd that something like this would be on 
a ballot," Jan said. "No, I wish it had never got to the point of needing to be 
on the ballot, in such harsh terms." 
</P>
<P>
 In such harsh terms. Yes, she is leaning in favor, because she thinks 
"something needs to be done." Why, she wonders, have illegal immigrants and 
their children been receiving benefits at all? "It's so inside out," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But then again, Jan doesn't want to throw children out of school, and she 
doesn't want to deny them preventive health care. And she doesn't want to turn 
teachers and nurses and doctors into INS agents. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Jan sees the students protesting -- all that anger -- she thinks 
about the potential for ethnic violence in a city that knows that story too 
well. So it makes her think twice. She knows that she's not a racist -- but is 
racism in the eye of the beholder? 
</P>
<P>
 We found ourselves in accord on several points. The Mexican flags and the 
student demonstrations, Jan and I agreed, would hurt the protesters' cause more 
than help it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can look at the faces of those kids," she said. "They're out to make a 
stand on something they don't know anything about more than I do." 
</P>
<P>
 It was interesting to hear that -- the frank admission of ignorance. Both 
sides will marshal their statistics and their arguments. But millions of people 
remain uncertain. Is it good medicine or bad medicine? 
</P>
<P>
 So for Jan and others like her, the question is what you do when you're 
feeling sick and you find a mysterious vial of pills in your medicine cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you really want to take one? Do you want to take the chance? 
</P>

A BITING PROBLEM; OFFICIALS SAY POPULAR DOG BREEDS CAN POSE DANGER TO CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scores of stitches later, the first-grader who used to look just like his 
father still loves the former playmate who suddenly, inexplicably, tried to 
kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 70-pound family dog, a flash of tooth and muzzle whose Japanese 
ancestors were bred to hunt bears, was put to sleep, while surgeons did their 
magic on the 6-year-old Ventura boy's face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget that one," said Richard Lambert, a Ventura County animal 
control officer who took the year-old Akita into custody after the Sept. 24 
attack. "We're not talking about a stray dog, a sick dog, but a family pet." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, across the country, officials are finding that the dog 
breed of the moment too often becomes the mauler of tomorrow, in part because 
breeders rushing to meet surging market demand have compromised some dogs' 
genetic integrity. Too often, the victims are trusting children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dog bites are the most commonly reported childhood health problem in the 
United States," said Rachel Lamb, a Humane Society spokeswoman in Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, Animal Regulation Department statistics over the last 13 
months indicate German shepherds and chow chows are the most likely to bite, 
followed by pit bulls, Rottweilers and -- a little farther down the list -- 
Akitas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that 90% of the (serious) bites are involving those dogs, the 
chows, the Akitas, the Rottweilers," said Kathy Jenks, county director of 
animal regulation. She speculated that German shepherds might head the list 
because they far outnumber the more notorious dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also found to be frequent biters, however, are cocker spaniels, Labrador 
retrievers and springer spaniels, certainly not the breeds a layman might 
consider dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're destroying breeds," said Debbie Inglis, owner of Inglis Pet Hotel in 
Oxnard and a longtime dog breeder. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some reputable breeders, of course," she said. "But there are too 
many back-yard breeders and others out there, especially with popular dogs. It 
takes years to learn bloodlines, but these people aren't waiting for that. 
They're in too much of a hurry . . . , and so less attention is paid too 
quality control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more over-bred the dog becomes, the more we're seeing problems among 
them. We're even seeing golden retrievers now who are biters. (And) Dalmatians 
. . . are showing up to do more biting." 
</P>
<P>
 Some breeders are even inbreeding families of dogs, mating parents with 
offspring and brothers with sisters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although eighth on the list -- in part because there are so few of them -- 
Akitas are emerging as a concern because of a genetic disorder that is 
spreading through their rising population. The disorder can make the dogs 
ill-tempered and unpredictable, said W. Jean Dodd, an Irvine veterinarian and 
immunologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Akitas) have been turned into something that they were never intended to 
be," said Thousand Oaks resident Barbara Bouyet, 45, national coordinator for 
the Akita Rescue Society of America. "They're breeding these dogs for money, 
and they give no thought to the outcome or the damage it does to children." 
</P>
<P>
 Name the breed -- Doberman pinscher, boxer, even Irish setter -- and observers 
have found that temperament problems accompanied each group's burgeoning 
popularity and resultant population explosion, said Inglis, who has bred German 
shepherds for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen to 20 years ago, the Saint Bernard was a very loving dog," she added, 
"but they became over-bred and (many) became very vicious dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 Overwhelmingly, the victims of dog bites are children -- an estimated 1.8 
million nationwide last year, according to the Humane Society of the United 
States. Nine children were killed by dogs in 1993 and 11 so far this year, 
including 5-year-old girl who was mauled by a Rottweiler Oct. 23 in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no recorded fatal dog attack in Ventura County history, the 
mauling on Sept. 24 came close. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that dog was going to try to kill that kid," said Officer Lambert, 
referring to the attack in which a baby-sitter pulled the Akita off Jeffrey 
Landry before it could inflict more injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally curious, incautious and small -- with their eyes at the dog's own 
level -- children often are mistaken by the animals as a challenge for 
dominance or as a nuisance that can be corrected with a bite, with little risk 
of retaliation by the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Male animals that are not neutered are three times more likely to bite than 
other dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb, who attributed most bites to irresponsible dog owners, said adults 
should teach children proper precautions with dogs and never leave them alone 
with certain breeds, such as Rottweilers and Akitas. 
</P>
<P>
 Deceptively cute as puppies -- hence their popularity -- Akitas have long 
served as protectors and nannies to children in their native Japan. But the 
genetic disorder that has infiltrated their ranks in America -- which Dodd 
linked to dietary changes, careless breeding and perhaps even to nuclear 
fallout after the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945 -- has left some 
Akitas prone to unpredictable bursts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 One example is the Sept. 24 attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Since joining the family as a puppy last fall, the Akita named Bear had romped 
the house with Jeffrey and his 4-year-old sister, Kassandra, under the parents' 
watchful supervision, father Alan Landry said. He said the boy even rode on the 
dog's back. But while Alan and Kim Landry attended a wedding that Saturday 
afternoon, Bear, without warning, knocked the boy to the concrete patio as he 
was leading the dog by the collar to the back-yard dog-run, the father said. 
Kassandra was playing on the grass nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Szatkowski, 19, the baby-sitter, rushed to the boy's aid and was bitten 
on the left forearm while pulling the dog off the child, Ventura firefighter 
Vern Alstot said. He said the boy's head and face had been severely mauled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew or had any idea that something like this could happen," Alan 
Landry said. "The (books) we bought told us they were a great family dog. . . . 
(But) if people could see what I saw and go through what we went through, they 
wouldn't have a dog like that, period, as long as they have kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The dog, which was euthanized while the boy was undergoing four hours of 
plastic surgery, is one of three Akitas killed since Jan. 1 by county officials 
after dog attacks. So far this year, Akitas in the county have attacked 16 
children, including three 2-year-olds who were bitten on the face. A 
22-month-old girl was killed by an Akita last year in St. Louis, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, where Akitas have been the national dog since 1931 and their line is 
strictly monitored, the animals are more temperate with humans and more 
predictable, Bouyet said. They originally were bred to guard emperors and to 
hunt and fight other dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Anastazya Tomoko Wada-Mellor, 29, who grew up Chigasaki, Japan, said Akitas 
served as nannies for her and her brothers from infancy on. "They baby-sat us, 
literally," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wada-Mellor, a member of Bouyet's Akita Rescue group, said she will not 
get an Akita here because of the behavioral disorders so rampant in their 
American population. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouyet said the hypothyroid disease that can trigger aggressive behavior among 
Akitas can be countered with hormone treatment. The genetically related disease 
afflicts about 70% of the Akita breed and can usually be detected with a simple 
blood test, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public isn't aware that these (blood) screenings are vitally important," 
Bouyet added. "The public doesn't demand it because they don't know it." Lamb, 
whose Humane Society estimates there are 2 million to 3 million reported dog 
bites each year nationwide, said, "What we find is that the breeds that attack 
depend on the whim of the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county bite totals do not reflect a particular breed's estimated 
share of the dog population -- Labradors far outnumber chow chows, for example 
-- the statistics do resemble lists compiled elsewhere, such as in Palm Beach, 
Fla., and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, five animal behaviorists, asked by a pet industry magazine to 
identify the most troublesome of the 134 recognized dog breeds, chose Akitas, 
chow chows, Rottweilers, Shar-Peis and Dalmatians, in that order. The first 
three accounted for a disproportionate number of bites -- 159 -- in the past 13 
months in Ventura County.

 While such breeds as cocker spaniels might score high on bite lists, they are 
of less concern, authorities say, because their bites are less severe and they 
are house dogs that tend to be exposed to more people. Chow chows, Akitas and 
Rottweilers, on the other hand, typically have fewer opportunities to bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing is personality disorders due to poor breeding, dogs that 
can be extremely neurotic and extremely fearing (of people)," said Liz Palika, 
an Oceanside dog trainer who participated in the magazine survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the American Kennel Club has set specific standards for size, shape 
and other physical traits of dogs, it has remained largely vague or even mute 
on disposition by breed, said Deena Case-Pall, a Camarillo-based psychologist 
and animal behaviorist. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven to meet suddenly skyrocketing demand, some "puppy mills" are inbreeding 
their animals and churning out dogs by mating within families, Inglis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't always look at themselves as being craftsmen when they 
breed dogs," Case-Pall said. "If you can put an egg and sperm together, you're 
a breeder, if by accident or on purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only can this muddy bloodlines and amplify genetic defects already 
appearing in some breeds, but it can also compound the risks faced by children. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a study by the federal Centers for Disease Control, Case-Pall said that 
a child by age 14 has a nearly 50% chance of suffering a serious dog bite. Most 
involve a known canine, like a neighbor's dog, she said, and the second most 
common bites are by children's own pets. Canines, whether poodles or Pekingese, 
are creatures of the pack and accordingly settle themselves into some niche in 
the group hierarchy, whether the group is canine or human, the county's Jenks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A child's lunge to hug a dog is, to some animals, a blatant effort to displace 
the dog in the social strata of the pack -- where the diminutive child 
typically is at the bottom -- and must be opposed with a snap, she said. Dog

FLOOD CONTROL PHILOSOPHER; OFFICIAL'S VIEWS ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF 
CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say the words "flood control district" to most environmentalists or wildlife 
biologists and the outcome is frequently predictable: They bristle, or as one 
biologist put it, they "pull out their hair." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it has been the flood control districts of the nation that stripped 
vegetation from barrancas and built concrete ditches to replace streams, washes 
and in some cases, rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Ventura County the top Flood Control official has earned a different 
reception in most circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Sheydayi, deputy director of public works in charge of flood control 
since 1991 and a 30-year employee of the district, takes a much broader 
approach to his job and to the environment than have his predecessors, many 
developers and environmentalists agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flood control districts have often been at odds with the (U.S.) Fish and 
Wildlife Service" said Cat Brown, a Ventura-based biologist with the service. 
"But Alex is progressive. He doesn't see protecting the environment and flood 
control as opposing objectives. He doesn't see the only way to provide flood 
protection is to destroy a river by encasing it in concrete." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that at one time, it was her job to act as liaison with Ventura 
County agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the biologists working with other nearby counties were pulling out 
their hair because the flood control districts were too entrenched to even 
consider doing business a different way," Brown said. "I used to wonder what 
they were complaining about. But I found that Alex's philosophy was very 
different from other directors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One example of his progressive approach came after the great storms and floods 
of 1992, which killed a homeless man when he was swept down the raging Ventura 
River and claimed the lives of an Oak View couple and their unborn child when a 
hillside slid into their home. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the Ventura Beach RV Resort, whose river bottom park turned into 
a sea of damaged or destroyed motor homes, was pressing Sheydayi and the 
district to clear the river of its considerable vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Arnold Hubbard claimed that the vegetation, and not the location of his 
RV park in the river's flood plain, was to blame for the damage to his 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not entitled to any protection," Sheydayi said in an interview after the 
floods. "He's in the river bottom. We don't protect people who intentionally go 
and build in the river bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Capelli, executive director of the Friends of the Ventura River and a 
biologist who teaches at U.C. Santa Barbara, said a less broad-minded man would 
have looked at the situation differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think almost any other district would have used that opportunity as an 
excuse to go in and engage in traditional flood control activities," Capelli 
said, citing brush clearing or altering the channel as typical actions.  
</P>
<P>
 "Alex is extremely bright, he's honest, he's practical and he gives you 
straight answers," Capelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Sheydayi is at the forefront of conservation in working to 
develop watershed management plans for the county's main waterways -- plans 
that look beyond a single problem related to one development and instead 
evaluate and plan for the entire area that feeds the rivers and creeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sitting in a coffee shop in Oakland after a watershed conference, and 
Alex remarked that there are not many other flood control districts interested 
in this," said Reed Holderman, program manager with the California Coastal 
Conservancy. "I told him, 'Alex, you're probably the only district in the state 
that is this far along with this kind of planning.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But a group of Newbury Park residents say Sheydayi was neither open-minded nor 
progressive when it came to their concerns about a debris catch basin being 
constructed near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Koetke, a resident and activist in Newbury Park, said her group of 
homeowners could not get the Flood Control District's attention to voice their 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were ignored on all of this," she said. The district should have done an 
environmental impact study on the large catch basin before the project was 
built, whether or not it was required by law, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not illegal, it's at least sleazy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Cohen, who has been at odds with the Flood Control District for more 
than 10 years over property he and his family want to develop in Newbury Park, 
said his problems with the department predate Sheydayi's tenure as the 
district's leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, Mr. Sheydayi has been very helpful to us," said Cohen, whose family 
has sued the city of Thousand Oaks over the proposed project. "He looks at a 
problem with all possible points of view and he has been able to come up with 
some ingenious solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sheydayi expressed surprise at Cohen's response. "You mean he didn't say I was 
a jerk?" he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 At 57, Sheydayi is fit and calm despite 13- and 14-hour work days. His work 
still presents a challenge, though he is sometimes frustrated at the lack of 
time he has to devote to all his projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has many interests that take him outside his role as engineer. He is a 
builder and remodeler at home; he and his wife of 35 years, Joan, like to folk 
dance; he enjoys travel and is a serious lover of classical music. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's often what we talk about when I see him," Capelli said. "One of the 
first times I ran into him outside of work was at a Mozart concert." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Alexei Sheydayi in 1937 in Iran to an Azerbaijani father and Russian 
mother, Sheydayi's first language was Russian.  
</P>
<P>
 That was followed by Farsi, the language of Iran, and then English. But he 
also learned some French, German and Italian -- "enough to get by" -- at a 
boarding school run by Italian monks that he and his brother attended after his 
mother died. 
</P>
<P>
 As a fair-skinned, freckled child in Iran with a distinctly Russian name, 
Sheydayi (he pronounces it SHAY-day) said he stood out as a foreigner and was 
teased by other children. "Kids would kid me about my name, they called me 
Alaska," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to the United States to earn a bachelor's degree. He studied at the 
University of Arizona and, as his father did before him and his son did after 
him, Sheydayi became an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheydayi is the father of three and grandfather of five, counting twin girls 
born to his daughter in San Diego last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Sheydayi describes her husband as a "modest man, kind of reserved." 
</P>
<P>
 But she also uses the same word that his boss, Arthur Goulet, picks to 
describe Sheydayi: brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always thinking of better ways to do things," said Goulet, the director 
of Public Works for the county. "I characterize him as a brilliant guy. The 
only criticism I've ever heard about him is that he's brusque and rigid. But 
he's not really, it's just that his mind moves so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 When Sheydayi wanted to become the co-chairman of a Santa Clara River 
watershed management plan, which includes more than 20 farmers, property 
owners, developers, environmentalists and other diverse interests, Goulet said 
he discouraged him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that was a death wish," Goulet said, referring to the problems 
involved with bringing so many points of view to the same negotiating table. 
"But he said if we get something out of it, it would be worth the trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 After 30 years, Sheydayi said, he occasionally thinks about retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about it from time to time, but not very seriously," he said. When 
first asked about a legacy he would leave, he dismissed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But on reflection, he added: "I have always pressed for a high standard. I 
insist we do a good job. I guess I'm somewhat persnickety about that."

ACRIMONY FINDS HOME ON VENTURA CITY COUNCIL; GOVERNMENT: AFTER MONTHS OF BITTER 
FLARE-UPS, MEMBERS SAY IT'S BECOMING HARDER TO DENY THAT THEY SIMPLY DON'T GET 
ALONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Already split into rival camps, Ventura City Council members have reached a 
new level of fractiousness in selecting a city manager -- seven months after 
former manager John Baker announced he was leaving because he could no longer 
take the hassles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some council members aren't necessarily willing to compromise on 
issues," Councilman Gregory L. Carson said. "But at a certain point, you see 
you are going to lose, and you negotiate to get the best you can. You try to 
get the best you can off that ship before it sinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the series of long, contentious, closed-session deliberations, 
after months of bitter flare-ups over hot-button issues, council members say it 
is harder and harder to deny that they simply don't get along. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one is not fun," says Councilman Gary Tuttle, the council's 
second-most-senior member, of the current panel's dynamics. "I just sit there 
(on the dais) and shake my head, time after time." 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have a problem," Councilman Steve Bennett allows, "when disagreements 
about issues become disagreements about personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly, agrees Councilman Jack Tingstrom, Bennett's sometime-ally. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no place in debate for barbed comments," Tingstrom says of the 
council's personal style of argument. "We're all adults. To me, that makes you 
look very immature." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 11 months, residents and local developers have watched the seven 
council members bicker extensively over some items. 
</P>
<P>
 Where previous councils split into a clear majority and minority, this 
council's alliances shift from issue to issue. When clashing over philosophical 
differences, council members often cite the viewpoints on the interests that 
elected them and refute each others' arguments with personal attacks and 
pointed volleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an acrimony, a lack of civility and a lack of morality," said Dennis 
Orrock, who served on the council from 1979 to 1985, when he chose not to run 
again. "I just see these people sitting up on the dais, floundering. I don't 
think they have a consensus on anything." 
</P>
<P>
 One such issue is the selection of a new city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months have passed since Baker announced his resignation. The council 
began a search four months ago, received a list of finalists a few weeks ago 
and launched into hours of interviews and deliberations on Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 They are due to meet again on Monday. But Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures said 
there is a possibility that the process will drag on into the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally think we've just gotten into the process," she said. "There's a 
good possibility we may have to do another search." 
</P>
<P>
 Measures, like many of her colleagues, weighs her words carefully before 
describing the bickering that has so far left the deliberations at a 
standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to be careful about saying anything that would further fragment us," 
she said. "Each of us have expressed that we want a more cohesive council. 
Whether it's actually carried out or not is a good question." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is precisely those types of disagreements that, in part, prompted Baker to 
leave in July to start his own consulting business. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he travels from city to city around the western United States, helping 
local governments solve specific problems. He says he sees the same type of 
divisions among politicians in Visalia that caused him such Angst in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (trend) took place in Ventura after it took place in Oakland and in Los 
Angeles," he said. "But all of the factors that get people elected to office 
now mean you don't have the same sort of people being elected that you used to. 
They're much more cognizant of special interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in council debates, the council members' support bases come up 
repeatedly as justification for not bending on particularly thorny issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to represent the voters, the ones that elected me," Tingstrom, who 
ran on a pro-business, growth-friendly platform, told Tuttle during an argument 
over housing allocations in August. "That is why I am saying we should give out 
allocations here." 
</P>
<P>
 To which Tuttle, a slow-growth candidate in the recent election, responded, 
"Some of us up here represent different voters and different viewpoints." 
</P>
<P>
 The current council came into existence last November, when newcomers 
Measures, a pro-business candidate, and Bennett, who ran as an 
environmentalist, joined five incumbents -- Tuttle, Carson, Jim Monahan, 
Tingstrom and Tom Buford, now the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle, Carson and Buford were used to sticking together and getting results. 
On the previous council, the trio could usually count on Councilman Todd 
Collart to provide the fourth vote needed to pass or kill a motion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Collart was defeated in 1993, and no one moved in to fill the spot. 
Bennett wanted to make up his own mind. Measures touted her own fast-paced, 
business-oriented agenda that clashed with the more politically moderate views 
of the other three. 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom and Monahan had never been part of the inner circle in the first 
place, mainly because Tingstrom was, like Measures, strongly pro-business, and 
Monahan was too idiosyncratic. 
</P>
<P>
 So the council started off the year with no clear majority. As the months went 
on, that did not change. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, other councils and boards that differ on issues often manage to get 
along on a personal level. But when Ventura's council disagrees, the meeting 
discussions can seem more like snide family arguments than philosophical 
differences of opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 On one recent discussion of housing issues, for instance, Monahan and Carson 
got into a tiff over whether Carson used proper procedure in writing up a 
resolution for a council vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this a resolution you prepared today?" Monahan asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did I prepare it today?" Carson responded. "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you've been working on it for some time?" Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you been working on this by yourself, not with other council members?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you going with this, Mr. Monahan?" Carson snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 'I'm just curious if you are consulting with other council members," Monahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not necessarily," Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not necessarily?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I have talked to the other council members that I am allowed to speak 
to in regards to what their concerns are," Carson said, "and I've taken those 
thoughts into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I know I didn't have any part in this," Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're right," Carson said, laughing. "You're right." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members protest that they do not always get along so poorly. After 
all, they say, the group has a lot more 5-2, 6-1 and 7-0 votes than it does 4-3 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "On some issues we get along very well. On others, no," said Monahan, who has 
been a councilman the past 17 years. "But this is not the most difficult 
council I've worked with." 
</P>
<P>
 It may, however, be the most difficult council that developer Bill Neel has 
worked with. 
</P>
<P>
 After some neighborhood opposition to his Ventura Avenue project surfaced this 
summer, Neel returned to the council for the enthusiastic support most of the 
members had provided all spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What he found instead, he said, was a mass of confusion and concern. Some 
council members still supported his proposal. But others backed off in the face 
of pressure from small businesses in the area that disliked the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard lots of things they (council members) didn't want, but none that 
they did," he said. "I don't think they have visions. I think they have 
constituencies. But you know, once you are elected, you are supposed to serve 
all the people of Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 Some in Ventura, however, argue that the council's fractiousness is actually a 
boon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased to see dysfunctional government," said Richard Francis, a Ventura 
lawyer and another former mayor, who chose not to run again when his council 
term ended in 1991. "It's the lifeblood of ultimate resolution, because only 
the best ideas will win out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," he added, "it does make it difficult when you have to pick one 
person to be a city manager. But the pressure will mount and they will finally 
bite the bullet and do it."

ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; ANTI-INITIATIVE DEMONSTRATION TAKES PEACEFUL TURN 
IN FILLMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The scene was familiar -- hundreds of marchers leaving a high school, waving 
signs and chanting slogans against Proposition 187.  
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday's demonstration in Fillmore was also very different. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters, numbering about 200, included not only the usual high school 
students but also teachers, parents, grandparents and toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mounted Ventura County sheriff's deputies policing the march had exchanged 
their customary riot helmets for baseball caps. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike recent protests in Oxnard marred by rock-throwing and fights, 
Saturday's event in Fillmore began with a prayer, proceeded peacefully along a 
planned route and ended with no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore protest march took place on a weekend so students could attend 
without skipping school, organizers said. It also allowed entire families to 
spend a sunny day together working against the ballot measure, which would deny 
illegal immigrants most government services, including public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters made no apologies for their status as weekend warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Elena Valenzuela, 17, a Fillmore High School senior who helped organize the 
protest, said walking out of school would have sent the wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not want to walk out of classes because that's the opposite of what we 
are fighting for, which is our education," Elena said. "How could we be 
fighting for our education if we do walkouts?" 
</P>
<P>
 The peaceful weekend protest drew praise from adults. "They acted in a very 
mature manner," said Fillmore High School Principal Lynn Johnson, who joined 
the march. Fillmore schools Supt. Mario V. Contini and City Councilman Scott 
Lee also walked with the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 The procession began in the high school parking lot with a prayer offered by 
the Rev. Jim Higgins of St. Francis of Assisi Church. As the marchers joined 
hands in a circle, Higgins told the walkers to "show peacefulness . . . to be a 
good example to our community." 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters marched about 2 1/2 miles, from the high school parking lot, 
through the mostly Latino neighborhood of north Fillmore, past orange groves 
and new housing tracts to City Hall and Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pushed strollers, others waved Mexican and American flags. Shepherded on 
their way by mounted deputies and student leaders, the marchers chanted "The 
people united will never be defeated!" and "No on 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore residents stood on their porches watching the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bystanders said they planned to vote for the proposition despite the 
protest. "I just don't think it's right for them to carry the Mexican flag," 
said Toni Tecau, 40, a lifelong Fillmore resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am tired of seeing us take care of all those immigrants," said her husband, 
Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 When the marchers reached Central Park, they gathered to hear speeches urging 
them to vote against the proposition and against politicians who support it. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the park, march organizers congratulated participants on their 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The march was fantastic," said Joe Torres, a Fillmore High history teacher 
who advises the Chicano student group at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres and students in his group said they spent hours last week averting 
threatened student walkouts. "We didn't want to lose the school time. We didn't 
want to have the stigma of the walkouts," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Fillmore High was the only predominantly Latino high school in Ventura 
County where students have not walked out during the school day to protest the 
proposition. Instead, they produced and screened in school an educational video 
on the ballot measure. And they organized Saturday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We proved that we can have a peaceful march," Torres said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; STUDENTS TOLD OF BILINGUAL TEACHER NEED

<P>
 Despite the perfect recipe for spending a Saturday afternoon outdoors -- blue 
skies and warm temperatures -- hundreds of Latino students instead chose to 
ponder their futures inside the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 300 students -- most from area high schools and a few from 
community colleges -- began arriving at Ventura College about 8 a.m. for the 
first Careers in Bilingual Education Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Ventura-Oxnard chapter of the California Assn. for Bilingual 
Education, the conference aimed to address the troubling shortage of bilingual 
teachers statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are responding to that need," said Martha Hernandez, co-president of the 
association. "The overall goal is to provide career-planning opportunities in 
bilingual education for aspiring students in our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the morning, students and parents chose from among 10 sessions 
whose topics included teaching opportunities at all school levels, special 
education and assisting migrant workers. One session was titled, "How Do I Tell 
Papi I Want to Go to School and Not Get Married?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to focus on young Latinas who, because of cultural aspects, have a 
difficult time convincing their fathers that going to school is an option for 
them as women," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1 p.m., the students packed into the cafeteria for a keynote speech by 
Oxnard City Councilman Andres Herrera, delivered in both Spanish and English. 
Herrera urged the students to cherish their cultural heritage and take 
advantage of opportunities that only education can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make the change to remove the shackles, the chains," he said to rounds of 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference then headed outdoors to the cafeteria courtyard. Lunching on 
chile verde in the shade of an umbrella with her boyfriend, Sandra Cervantez, 
18, said she was motivated by the day's proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really helps us open our minds," said Cervantez, who graduated last year 
from Channel Islands High School. "We can become something, and not be 
considered 'just another minority.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her boyfriend, Robert Gonzalez, 17, said he wanted to join the Navy to become 
a pilot after graduating from Frontier High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now I might change my mind and go into teaching migrant workers," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Rodrigues, a trustee with the Ventura Unified School District, said 
educators hope to make the conference an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe (the students) won't go into teaching," he said, "but it has them 
thinking." RODNEY BOSCH

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 4 COUNCIL CANDIDATES REPORT CONTRIBUTIONS

 Scrambling to finance last-minute advertising, four candidates for the 
Thousand Oaks City Council have reported fresh loans or contributions to their 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Dentist Greg Cole, who earlier lent his campaign $17,000, poured another 
$5,000 of his own money into the heated race this week.Cole is running two 
cable television ads, repeated dozens of times each day on popular shows. He 
has also sent out letters and pamphlets to targeted groups of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 With the latest infusion of cash, Cole's treasury is up to more than $37,000 
-- tops among the 16 candidates running for the Thousand Oaks council. 
</P>
<P>
 Rival candidate Marshall Dixon, a retired businessman, loaned his campaign 
$2,500 this week. Dixon plans to use the money for a television commercial 
featuring his 7-year-old granddaughter, Danielle. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual twist, Dixon's ad never shows the candidate's face. Instead, the 
commercial features a childish voice telling voters to consider Dixon because 
of his concern for youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Other campaign filings this week showed that incumbent Elois Zeanah's 
reelection committee donated valuable services to two other candidates, retired 
filmmaker M. Ali Issari and city operations manager David Hare. 
</P>
<P>
 Hare reported receiving more than $5,880 worth of campaign signs from Zeanah's 
committee. Issari received $2,300 for printing a brochure. STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; TRASH PRECAUTIONS IN MEDFLY AREA URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Homeowners in Ventura County's Medfly quarantine area are being encouraged to 
double bag their garbage, particularly if it contains clippings from fruit 
trees or produce, federal agricultural officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Hendrix, a spokesman for the state and federal Cooperative Medfly 
Project, said the double bagging is a precaution against the Mediterranean 
fruit fly spreading to another part of the county while the trash is being 
transported.Officials at Bailard Landfill turned away one load of trash about 
two weeks ago, because it contained trimmings from a lemon tree within the 86 
square-mile quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill in Oxnard had been ordered to inspect and reject trash loads that 
came from individual property owners and contained citrus from the quarantine 
area. Those loads were then diverted to the landfill in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 However, on Thursday, state agricultural officials lifted the restrictions on 
Bailard. The Oxnard landfill will no longer have to inspect loads from private 
individuals, and can accept all trash from the Camarillo area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect they've decided it doesn't pose as much of a hazard as they thought 
initially," said John Conaway, director of solid waste for the Ventura Regional 
Sanitation District, which operates the Bailard Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Haden, the district's director of operations, said there was little risk 
of the fruit fly spawning if it were to arrive at the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once a load comes in, it hits the ground and is buried within a few minutes 
and covered at the end of the day with dirt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash picked up by commercial haulers is considered less of a risk for 
transporting the Medfly because the garbage is compressed inside a container.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; VISTA TO CHANGE SOME ROUTES, SERVICE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four months after launching a new countywide bus program, the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission has agreed to tinker with the service to better meet 
the needs of commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Nov. 14, service on the Ventura Intercity Service Transit Authority, 
or VISTA, will stop at Oak Park High School four times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oak Park service will be added to the East line, which also stops in 
Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses on the Central line, which travels between Oxnard and Camarillo, will 
begin stopping at Oxnard Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 And a stop at Lewis Road in Camarillo will be added to the VISTA-101 route, 
which travels from Ventura to Thousand Oaks along the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission on Friday also agreed to reduce midday service on the Central 
and East routes because of low ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 Average daily ridership on the six VISTA routes has more than doubled since 
the program's inception. In July, an average of 413 riders boarded VISTA buses 
each day. In October, the average daily ridership reached 852. 
</P>
<P>

1-800-438-1112. SARA CATANIA

OBITUARIES; SAMUEL FRANCIS, 71; FAMED ARTIST AND PHILANTHROPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Samuel Lewis Francis, an internationally acclaimed artist known for his 
exuberant, spiritually charged abstractions, died late Friday night of 
complications from cancer at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 One of a handful of famed Abstract Expressionists to be based in Southern 
California, Francis was 71, said a spokeswoman for the Litho Shop, the 
printmaking facility he established in Santa Monica for his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Renowned on three continents, his oeuvre combined aspects of Eastern 
philosophy and Western science in paintings that exude spontaneous energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although known and respected in such world capitals as Paris and Tokyo, 
Francis opted to spend most of his final three decades in the Los Angeles area, 
where he painted, made prints, published books, planned exhibitions and engaged 
in philanthropies. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the latter was the Museum of Contemporary Art in Downtown Los Angeles, 
where he was a founding trustee and a member of the board of trustees until 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year he donated 10 of his paintings to the Museum of Contemporary Art, 
including some of his major works from 1951 to 1992. It marked the largest 
single gift to MOCA from an artist in the museum's history. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Francis was hailed as "the heart of MOCA," by Frederick Nicholas, 
chairman emeritus of the museum board.. 
</P>
<P>
 Although famous for his own artwork, Francis pursued many diverse interests, 
including the Lapis Press, which he established in 1984 to publish books 
combining art with poetry, philosophy and psychology. He also established the 
Sam Francis Medical Research Center, a foundation for research in communicable 
and environmental diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his health began to fail, Francis not only remained at his easel but 
maintained a lifestyle that included frequent marriages and admitted 
overindulgences in food and drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a spender. I spend myself," Francis told The Times in 1991, three years 
after his 1957-58 work "Towards Disappearance" brought $1.3 million at auction. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time he had no less than six shows on view or in progress, including 
one in Paris titled "Sam Francis: 40 Years of Friendship" honoring the artist's 
long relationship with Swiss dealer Eberhard Kornfeld, who continues to 
represent him.  
</P>
<P>
 Times art critic William Wilson once called Francis' work "completely 
nontheoretical." 
</P>
<P>
 "He splashed color orgiastically in blobs, rivulets or circular shapes 
resembling burst bubbles," Wilson said. "Encountered singly, Francis' graphics 
-- mainly lithographs -- are physically and emotionally cathartic, like 
fantasies of making love floating in midair or taking a cool shower in colored 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except," Wilson continued, "they actually never call up direct associations 
to any experience other than themselves. . . . Always the same and always 
changing, suggesting an art of graded moods. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Francis, whose works are in public collections in more than 40 museums in the 
United States, Canada, Europe and Japan and who was one of 16 American painters 
chosen to design posters for the 1984 Olympics, was born in San Mateo in 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 His father was a mathematics professor and his mother a pianist and French 
teacher who captivated her son with her supposed clairvoyant powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis started a premed course at UC Berkeley in 1941 but dropped out in 1943 
to join the U.S. Army Air Corps. He suffered an in-flight injury leading to 
spinal tuberculosis and started painting while a patient in a succession of 
veterans hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1945, while at Ft. Miley Veterans Administration Hospital in San Francisco, 
he met David Park, an expressionistic figure painter and teacher at the 
California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco. Park took an interest in 
Francis' work, which at the time consisted of portraits and landscapes, and 
acquainted him with the genius of Picasso, Joan Miro and Paul Klee. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon Francis' recovery, he returned to UC Berkeley, but this time as an art 
major. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1950, he went to Paris to study and married for the first time. It was 
there two years later that he had his first one-man show, at the Galerie du 
Dragon. Critics praised the monochromatic white paintings, some measuring 10 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis remarried after a divorce in 1960 and traveled between Paris, Bern and 
Tokyo, but fell ill with tuberculosis of the kidney and returned to the United 
States, where he convalesced in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, he set up shop in Santa Monica but continued to maintain studios in 
Japan and Europe. In 1965, he married for the third time after another divorce 
two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two decades he was to accumulate honors almost as rapidly as he 
produced paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, he married artist Margaret Smith. In addition to her, he is survived 
by four children. Funeral service information is available through the Litho 
Shop, (310) 828-0792.

2 HOPE TO UNSEAT INGLEWOOD'S LONGTIME MAYOR; ELECTION: CITY COUNCIL'S GARLAND 
HARDEMAN AND JUDITH DUNLAP VIE FOR POST OF 12-YEAR LEADER EDWARD VINCENT, WHOSE 
STRATEGY IS TO IGNORE THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward Vincent, mayor of Inglewood, is usually all over town. He's shaking 
hands at banquets and lunches. Rubbing shoulders at sign raisings or store 
openings. Schmoozing people at early morning business meetings. Hamming it up 
at evening networking sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it can be difficult to get away from Vincent -- unless you're running 
against him for office. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recent mayoral debate at the Mayflower Ballroom, Vincent was absent. 
His opponents, Garland Hardeman, a five-year veteran of the Inglewood City 
Council, and Judith Dunlap, a councilwoman for 18 months, sat side by side, 
occasionally sparred with one another and attacked Vincent for not attending. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent, who did not once debate his opponents during the campaign, sent a 
letter to the Beach Cities League of Women Voters apologizing for his absence 
but saying his record stands for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Vincent has entirely ignored his opponents throughout the campaign and 
has focused on driving home his accomplishments and goals. In conversations 
about the campaign, he rarely mentions either Hardeman or Dunlap. That strategy 
has helped make this election season one of the calmest in recent Inglewood 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I be bothered with them?" Vincent said at a fund-raiser last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, Inglewood elections have been anything but quiet. In 1987, 
Hardeman lost his first council race in a bid to unseat one of the mayor's 
allies, Ervin (Tony) Thomas. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge, however, threw 
out that election, ruling that Vincent and other Thomas supporters had invaded 
voters' rights to ballot secrecy during a house-to-house ballot drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Vincent was fined $16,000 by the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission. The mayor denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent's political luster was briefly tarnished, but he weathered the scandal 
and has remained the city's head cheerleader. Inglewood, he often says, is 
unfairly disparaged by outsiders who have been influenced by media-perpetuated 
stereotypes of cities populated by blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in a video put together for his campaign, the narrator refers to 
Inglewood as almost a paradise. His primary job as mayor, he says, is to fight 
a never-ending barrage of wrong perceptions about Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent, 60, was a football star at the University of Iowa in the 1950s and 
played briefly with the Los Angeles Rams until an injury stymied his career. 
His conversation is filled with football analogies and calls for teamwork. He 
became the city's first black mayor 12 years ago and has been easily reelected 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
 He is particularly well-liked by many in the business community, who say that 
Vincent's positive spin on events can only help the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime, though high in Inglewood, remains on a 10-year downward trend, 
according to Inglewood police statistics. And Crime Watch Consultants, based in 
Marina del Rey, recently praised the city for being among the top 10 cities in 
California in which crime has dropped between 1992 and 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's great! The city's great! All anyone has to do is look around!" 
Vincent said recently at a $100-per-person "Monday Night Football" fund-raiser 
for his campaign at Hollywood Park. "I feel very confident. Why shouldn't I? 
Inglewood is better today financially than it's been at any time in its 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 business leaders in Inglewood, nearly half of them residents, 
gathered for the event; others had contributed but did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I became mayor, crime was at an all-time high," read a statement at each 
table. "We had to beg developers and home builders to consider us. Unemployment 
was high. Graffiti and prostitution plagued the city. More importantly, our 
community spirit was nonexistent. Using teamwork we've turned all that around." 
</P>
<P>
 The major criticism leveled at him by his opponents is that he is unduly 
guided by City Manager Paul D. Eckles. Vincent treats it like praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud to be connected with Paul Eckles," Vincent said. "Eckles has this 
city a Triple A bond rating with Standard & Poors -- and they don't go on 
personality." Vincent was referring to the highest possible municipal bond 
rating, which allows a city to borrow money at lower rates of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 To run against Vincent is to allege that Inglewood has problems, which can be 
a touchy election theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardeman has walked a careful line, pointing out that Inglewood is a great 
place, but saying it could be a lot better. Vincent, he said, lacks vision, and 
even if he had it, Eckles wouldn't let him use it. 
</P>
<P>
 "His leadership of the city has left a lot to be desired. For example, the 
poverty rate in Inglewood is the highest in the South Bay. Why, when we have 
more assets than most?" Hardeman said, referring to Hollywood Park, the Forum 
and other major businesses in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardeman decries the same crime rate that Vincent touts. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, do we know that it's falling? We've seen an increase in our 
population, especially our immigrant population, (which doesn't) traditionally 
report crime," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that, although overall crime has dropped nearly 12%, murders 
have been on the rise. In 1982, the year Vincent took office, 17 people were 
killed in Inglewood, police statistics show. In 1993, 47 people were murdered. 
"Is that an improvement?" Hardeman asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardeman, 37, holds a master's degree in public administration. A Los Angeles 
police officer for 15 years, Hardeman now serves as a field representative for 
Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton).  
</P>
<P>
 He proposes bringing technology-based industries to Inglewood, such as those 
developing rail cars and alternative fuels. Among his accomplishments he counts 
his work to help start after-school programs in his district, as well as the 
Late Night Basketball program at Darby Park for at-risk teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardeman also promoted community police centers and worked to enact an 
ordinance prohibiting the proliferation of small motels, a move intended as a 
deterrent to drug dealing and prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, he said, he would work to attract more restaurants and specialty 
stores to the city's commercial corridors. "We should have a Third Street 
(Promenade) here like in Santa Monica or an Old Town Pasadena," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, about 125 Hardeman supporters, some of whom also attended Vincent's 
football fund-raiser, gathered at a $15-per-person party in the Hollywood 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhythm and blues hits, soft raps and funky tunes kept the youngish crowd 
dancing until about 1 a.m. Hardeman, sporting black leather pants, a black 
shirt and a red jacket, talked and danced with guests and raffled off tickets 
to his Oct. 29 fund-raiser at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Jackee Harry of the television show "Sister, Sister" mingled with 
guests and then took a microphone and urged the crowd to get "that old man" out 
of Inglewood, referring to Vincent, and to "let somebody young do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Hardeman calls for change to revitalize the city, Dunlap goes several 
steps further and says only a change in leadership can save the city from 
peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, who taught for 25 years in Inglewood's schools before leaving on 
disability, charges at council meetings and wherever she speaks publicly that 
Inglewood's administration, staff and even some council members, are dishonest. 
She has not accused anyone by name. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a rising tide of fiscal mismanagement, a rising tide of corruption 
in City Hall and a rising tide of moral deterioration," Dunlap said at the 
recent League of Women Voters debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Her allegations infuriate city staff and her council colleagues. The charges, 
however, resonate with some voters in her district. When she called upon 
supporters in February to protest what she said was an effort by Eckles to keep 
city staff from providing her with information, more than 100 people packed a 
City Council meeting on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckles strongly denied that he has behaved improperly or discourteously to 
Dunlap, saying at that time that her constant requests for documents and 
research into the minutiae of running government were wasting city money and 
staff time. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her promise to try to oust Eckles if elected mayor, Dunlap says 
she will ensure that local minority businesses receive more city contracts. 
Businesses outside Inglewood often are given thousands of dollars in contracts 
to perform jobs that could be fulfilled by local contractors, Dunlap said. 
Vincent and other city officials, however, say bidding for contracts is fairly 
applied to all businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have been a staunch supporter of recycling dollars in our community, and 
that's fallen on deaf ears," she said. " We have a $160-million budget, and I 
believe we can generate our own local economic development."

FLAP OVER FILMING OF MOVIE IS A NON-EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article (Oct. 27) about the filming of an adult movie on the grounds of 
Burbank's water and power plant was interesting. The filming was legal, had the 
required police permits and took place Sunday morning, normally a quiet day. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, a few city employees were offended when they came to work and 
noticed the filming. Somebody complained to a supervisor. One employee said he 
felt the behavior he saw would be acceptable in a bar but not at his workplace. 
A less newsworthy event can hardly be imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank city manager and the general manager of the Public Services 
Department were worried and concerned about the potential "unfavorable effect 
(upon these two or three city employees) on the reputation of the city of 
Burbank, and of the Public Services Department." Their solution: to call a news 
conference and splash this non-event in front of millions of Southern 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do I think Burbank is having an election?

CSUN ATHLETICS PROGRAM WORTH SUPPORTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to your article and editorial regarding the Cal State Northridge 
athletic referendum that was defeated, I think that Bob Heigert has a point. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former cheerleader, student and graduate of CSUN, I am glad that the 
athletic program at Northridge was strong during my years there. It not only 
gave me the opportunity to experience what Heigert calls "the college 
experience," but it also gave me a perspective on how hard it is for players to 
not only cope with school, grades and jobs (part and full-time), but also to 
play on an athletic team. 
</P>
<P>
 To defeat this referendum and to say that the CSUN administration needs to 
"rethink" its position on backing the athletics program is a slap in the face 
to all those athletes who are working, playing and learning at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fact: Northridge has had a hard year. But to say that athletics needs 
to suffer because of it is wrong. CSUN's athletic programs are successful and 
win -- check it out, go to a game and then make a decision. And to the older 
and job-holding students, take your children to a game. Northridge sports 
aren't just for "college-age" students, they are for the community. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Your editorial, "Heed CSUN Student Vote on Sports" (Oct. 23) makes a valid 
point about listening to students' needs, but it reveals some shortsightedness 
as well.  
</P>
<P>
 CSUN, by its own admission, has been struggling for fame while it lingers in 
the shadows of UCLA and USC. Sports bring that fame, and fame brings money. 
</P>
<P>
 How popular would Duke University be if its basketball team weren't on TV 
every Saturday during basketball season? And what would people think of Notre 
Dame if it got no recognition from football? Both Duke and Notre Dame have 
strong academic traditions, but chances are neither would be as popular as they 
are, nor would they have the money to spend on faculty, campus improvements and 
other areas of importance, if sports didn't play such a big role for them. 
Sports generate revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 By passing the referendum, students would have committed themselves to an 
extra $49 per semester. That would have been an added pressure to some but an 
investment in a long-term commitment to the university. CSUN has a good 
reputation in Southern California, but beyond that many people have never heard 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong sports program is likely to attract local TV and corporate 
sponsorship, which in turn means donations from local and national companies, 
For now, that money is earmarked for athletics. But as soon as those programs 
are up and running, the money goes to the business, science and music 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 As a graduate of CSUN, I know part of the reason so few students voted is 
because so few care to have a voice in student politics. But a recognizable 
campus -- for sports and academics -- will mean a more active student body, a 
more recognized university and a more respected name in the community.

LOCAL FUNDS STILL ANSWER FOR LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's good to hear that Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) wants as much 
out of the federal crime bill as possible to help Los Angeles hire more police 
officers. And it's also reassuring to know that Los Angeles City Councilman 
Richard Alarcon has gotten his colleagues on the council to look into adding a 
new police district in the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the extent that both efforts depend upon how much can be obtained 
through the crime bill, and how soon, we must issue a cautionary note. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the $2.3-billion crime bill signed into law by President Clinton is 
for more police, but part will go to new state prisons and to beef up border 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it is not as though any locality, even one as large as Los Angeles, 
is going to get huge sums immediately. Indeed, the first $200 million chunk of 
crime bill money was divided among 392 municipalities. Los Angeles County 
received $3 million, enough to help hire 33 more officers. We say "help" 
because local governments have to put up some of the costs of hiring those 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman says that the San Fernando Valley alone needs 1,000 more police 
officers. Maybe he's right, but there will have to be a lot of local money on 
the table to help us get there. And the crime bill, as this money is being 
allocated, is not going to cough up enough funding in one sum to open Alarcon's 
new police station. The new officers are going to come in slowly, and any new 
station is going to have to involve some transfers from other parts of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill is producing some badly needed federal help, but the fight to 
beef up the LAPD now moves to the local stage, and that means local money.

YOU MAY BE SURPRISED AT WHO'S AGAINST PROP. 187; CONSERVATIVE, BUSINESS, POLICE 
LEADERS SEE MEASURE AS A GRAVE MISTAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. includes more than 400 member 
businesses and affiliates in the San Fernando Valley and its environs. Together 
they employ 250,000 people. That makes the overwhelming consensus VICA's board 
recently reached on Proposition 187 both meaningful and worthy of note. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-nine VICA board members participated. Thirty-one of them (more than 
79%) came out against Proposition 187, the so-called Save Our State initiative 
on Tuesday's ballot. Three were in favor of it, and five took no position. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is the measure that would prohibit state and local governments 
from providing education, health care and other social services to illegal 
immigrants. State and local agencies would suddenly be required to report 
"apparent illegal aliens" to immigration authorities. We are strongly opposed 
to this initiative, and urge voters to cast their ballots against it. 
</P>
<P>
 For the VICA board, the reasoning was simple: It would make a bad situation 
even worse. It would force schools, businesses, hospitals and other 
social-service organizations to take on the role of the police. It could cost 
billions of dollars in federal revenues and would cost taxpayers additional 
millions of dollars for legal fees in immediate court battles over its 
constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, according Benjamin Reznik, VICA's immediate past chairman: "There is 
nothing in Proposition 187 that deals with stopping illegal immigration. There 
is not one penny to help with border patrols. It does not deal with the root 
causes of illegal immigration, which is people coming across the border to get 
jobs, not benefits. Proposition 187 is an angry knee-jerk reaction to a 
frustration that we all share, but it will do more harm than good." 
</P>
<P>
 VICA is hardly alone in its fears about the damage that 187's passage would 
do, and we have compiled quite a list of eloquent opponents. In the business 
community, the initiative is also opposed by Bank of America Vice Chairman 
Michael Rossi, by J. P. Morgan Securities Managing Director Michael George and 
by Michael R. Peevey, former president of Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 "is like an arrow aimed right at the heart of California's 
business climate," adds Mel Katz, director of the Greater San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 But we've more ground to cover than this. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for instance, the Jewish Community Coalition Against Proposition 
187. It represents more than 3,300 San Fernando Valley families, as well as 
regional Jewish organizations representing another 50,000 families. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 "makes informants out of all of us," said Rabbi Harold M. 
Schulweiss, a member of the coalition. For another member, Tzivia Schwartz, 
187's requirements remind her of "the experience the Jewish community had in 
Europe, where being suspected of being Jewish was grounds for all kinds of 
horrible things." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles, said that 187 amounts to "a 
message that includes tossing hundreds of thousands of kids out of school, that 
refuses to immunize children and that asks taxpayers to gamble $15 billion in 
federal funds that come to California each year." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the Rev. Richard C. Kennedy said: "Proposition 187 is 
immoral. This thing is godless." 
</P>
<P>
 In the medical community, the California Medical Assn. and the California 
Assn. of Hospitals are already preparing lawsuits to thwart the initiative, 
should it pass on Tuesday. And a team of UCLA and USC medical researchers said 
the initiative will hasten the spread of tuberculosis in California because 
immigrants will be afraid to seek out medical authorities. The researchers also 
fear the return of long-dormant strains of syphilis and a re-emergence of 
measles. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is opposed by Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams, the 
Los Angeles Police Commission, and Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block on 
the grounds that kicking youngsters out of school will only leave them 
vulnerable to gangs and other criminal influences. The initiative "is a fraud 
and a hoax," says Block. 
</P>
<P>
 And prominent Republicans and conservatives have lined up against Proposition 
187. They include William J. Bennett, education secretary under President 
Reagan, and Jack Kemp, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development under 
President Bush. Both Bennett and Kemp have denounced the initiative as 
"profoundly anti-conservative" and "fundamentally flawed." Proposition 187 
would "demean all immigrants," according to Brian O'Leary Bennett, a former 
chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan. And William Safire, perhaps the 
preeminent conservative columnist of our day, considers the measure an 
"abomination." 
</P>
<P>
 Vote no on 187. It's too much of a risk to take.

PROVIDING PARKLAND IN THE VALLEY; $10-MILLION HANSEN DAM PROJECT WILL 
REVITALIZE A PRECIOUS COMMODITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parks are a precious and scarce commodity in the city of Los Angeles, so much 
so that municipally owned parkland accounts for just 5.4% of our metropolis's 
464 square miles. It's even worse in the San Fernando Valley, with just 3.9% of 
220.7 square miles set aside as city parks. The Valley falls far short of the 
Planning Department's park provision standard of one acre of parkland for every 
1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the East Valley that's really gotten the short shrift in these 
matters over the years. Although the unofficial boundary between the East 
Valley and the West Valley leaves two areas of roughly equal geographical size 
-- 119.3 square miles in the west, and 101.4 square miles in the east -- more 
than 65% of the Valley's parkland is in the west. 
</P>
<P>
 That untenable discrepancy highlights the particular importance of last week's 
multimillion-dollar agreement between the city of Los Angeles and the U. S. 
Army Corps of Engineers. Both parties have agreed to share the cost of the 
long-awaited $10-million revitalization project at the Hansen Dam Recreation 
Center in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the former lake at the site was a major regional recreational 
attraction. But severe flooding in the area in the 1970s and 1980s choked the 
old 120-acre Holiday Lake and turned it into a silt-filled mess. The 
surrounding park soon fell into disrepair and became a haven for gangs and the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Some park supporters are disappointed about the shelving of a 1991 master plan 
that called for a new 70-acre lake. But City Councilman Richard Alarcon and 
others are right when they say that the city cannot afford a such a project 
now. The new recreation area will be considerably smaller, but is no less 
important because of that. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be limited to a new 1 1/2-acre swimming lake and a nine-acre boating 
and fishing lake, but it will include expanded equestrian trails and new picnic 
and parking area. This is possible because of the money from a 1992 
voter-approved initiative and federal matching dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The one area of concern we have is in the admission fee that may be levied to 
help pay for maintenance and security. Part of the area closest to the park has 
a poverty rate of 20% to 40%. Care must be given to ensure that this is a park 
that everyone will be able to afford and enjoy.

SYBERT'S PLAN TO FIGHT CRIME IS OUTLANDISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rich Sybert, Republican candidate for Congress, would use the U. S. Army to 
fight crime (Valley Commentary, Oct. 9).What next? Should we arm politically 
reliable civilians to assist the Army? We could call them attaches. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has used Army troops for permanent general police duties in America 
since George III. Most true conservatives, myself included, are very 
distrustful of anyone who would expand federal power, especially federal police 
power.

GRANT HIGH TREATED UNFAIRLY IN COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to personally thank you for single-handedly destroying the 
reputation of Grant High School with such headlines as "2 Grant Students 
Stabbed, 1 Shot in Race Attacks" (Oct. 19). 
</P>
<P>
 Journalism such as this creates unnecessary fear in the minds of parents.With 
open enrollment, the parents of the "good" students will, out of fear, place 
their children in high schools other than Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears to us, the student body, that you have singled us out. When Notre 
Dame had a drive-by shooting a while back, there was no front page coverage, 
and when race wars broke out at North Hollywood High, there were no headlines 
reading, "North Hollywood High -- Breeding Ground for Hate Groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant has long been a haven for students who care about their futures. 
However, with your article, we may no longer keep our place as a "great 
school."

CONTROLLED BURN SHOULD BE PART OF PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial "Fighting Fire With Fire" is laudable. However, the reason 
behind the Topanga residents' reluctance toward controlled burning was not the 
risk but the perceived negative aesthetics of the burn. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming majority of residents of Topanga Canyon were in favor of the 
prescribed burn, but a single resident did not want any black ash next to his 
property. Individual hillside residents have little control over their own 
destiny regarding catastrophic wildfire survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The area under consideration had been identified in 1985 as having potential 
for catastrophic wildfire. The residents of Topanga were notified of this 
potential. The November, 1993, fires validated it. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of the Super Scooper aircraft will continue the policy of putting 
out all of the easy fires and allow the continuation of a massive fuel 
build-up. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of fire management techniques, including prescribed burning, 
environmentally selective brush clearing, homeowner education and involvement 
can mitigate this threat. 
</P>

2 VIEWS ON THE LEASE LAW IN SAN FERNANDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, as you say in your Oct. 23 editorial "San Fernando's Ridiculous Lease 
Law," our city is only 2.4 square miles. This is exactly why we have to have a 
law to protect what little city property we now have, particularly the property 
in question. 
</P>
<P>
 This property, because of its location, is valuable. Los Angeles County has 
wanted it for years. Unfortunately past City Council actions have forced us, 
the people, to create a law to be sure it could not be sold, exchanged or 
leased, without the people's vote. 
</P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles city attorney's office will pay $6,300 per month for five 
years without any increase. The city of San Fernando will pay for all capital 
improvements, about $1,455 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 I think L. A. will have to pay its own phone bill. I'm surprised the city 
didn't offer to pick up that too!

 Somebody is getting a great deal and it isn't the city of San Fernando.

 Andrea Hecht touched the tip of an iceberg in her commentary on the difficulty 
of finding people to do earthquake repair ("Time For Contractors To Build a 
Rapport With Clients," Oct. 16). 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these "professionals" were not that to begin with, and the high demand 
for their services is now aggravating that problem.Homeowners frequently add 
fuel to the fire by not managing their own affairs. The result can be a 
travesty. 
</P>
<P>
 I recommend the publication "What You Should Know Before You Hire a 
Contractor," available from the Contractor's State License Board (800) 
321-2752. Read and heed. 
</P>
<P>
 Apropos, do not ever pay for an estimate. It is part of the overhead costs of 
running a service business. Ask any professional.

SHOULD THE CRA BE USED TO HELP THE VALLEY'S QUAKE RECOVERY?; TYPICALLY THE 
AGENCY HELPS WITH COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN BLIGHTED 
AREAS. ITS APPROACH MIGHT NOT WORK FOR AREA WITH SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By BOBBI FIEDLER, Bobbi Fiedler of Northridge is a commissioner of the Los 
Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency.

<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly 10 months of steady progress in repairing damage from the 
Northridge earthquake, the San Fernando Valley is facing a significant 
decision: whether to use the Community Redevelopment Agency to help the 
recovery along. This is not an empty bureaucratic issue -- it's important. 
Valley residents should pay attention and play a part in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley property owners are moving aggressively to rebuild, repair and 
renovate. A substantial amount of damage was covered by insurance. City and 
state officials moved quickly and effectively to mine federal tax dollars. It's 
true that some homeowners and business people have been slow to act, but the 
government has extended the deadline for applications for assistance, and 300 
to 600 people a day are still calling the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals by Valley City Council members to create redevelopment zones in 
earthquake-damaged areas are designed to fill the void for those properties not 
covered by either private insurance or government assistance. I am a Community 
Redevelopment Agency commissioner appointed by the mayor. I have attended most 
of the hearings held throughout the Valley in the past two weeks. I have not 
yet made up my mind on the wisdom of bringing the CRA into our community. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA is a state-mandated agency born out of the need to help improve 
blighted areas. For decades it has been working in central Los Angeles. Last 
summer, City Council members looked to the CRA as another potential source of 
earthquake relief funds using the CRA law's emergency provisions. These 
provisions do not require the CRA to find blight, and they bypass much of the 
lengthy approval process. Otherwise the process would work as it does in 
Hollywood, South-Central and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When a redevelopment zone is created, the CRA sells bonds to raise money. It 
repays the debt using money generated by the increase in the property taxes in 
the zone. The higher taxes are caused by improved buildings in the zone and by 
inflation. The bond money is put into building projects, usually through loans 
to private individuals and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Most council members have narrowly drawn the proposed CRA districts to include 
only commercial property and apartment buildings. The exception is in the 
northwest Valley, where virtually all of the inhabited area of the 12th Council 
District is proposed to be labeled a redevelopment area. The effect would be to 
create a very large fund and the very large debt that goes with it. That 
redevelopment area would be 5 1/2 times the size of the other proposed Valley 
CRA areas combined. 
</P>
<P>
 There appears to be a potential place for the CRA in the recovery effort for 
commercial buildings and multifamily housing. But for several reasons, CRA's 
place in neighborhoods of single-family homes is extremely questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 First, single-family homes would receive little or no benefit from CRA loans. 
Historically, single-family homes have been left out of CRA zones for this very 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, diverting much of their property tax increase to the CRA would result 
in a further reduction of services that already are underfunded in the Valley 
-- police and fire protection, parks, libraries and street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, under California law, people selling a home must disclose anything that 
would materially affect a buyer's decision to purchase it. This would certainly 
require sellers to disclose that the house was in a redevelopment area, since 
among other things it would be subject to CRA controls. This disclosure could 
have an effect on the value of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 A CRA is not a money tree. It represents a choice in where tax money goes. CRA 
funds have to be paid back, at a cost higher than other forms of financing. The 
pay-back period runs anywhere from 35 to 40 years, even though the plans are 
scheduled to run for only 5 to 10 years. Additionally, CRA funds have about 40% 
taken off the top before they ever get to the community. Half of this is 
mandated by law for low-income housing. The other half must go to other taxing 
entities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each council district has held community meetings on CRA involvement. Now it's 
on to City Hall. Separate joint CRA-City Council hearings will be held for each 
council district. After those hearings, revisions may be made and a vote taken 
on each redevelopment zone. Here are some of the questions I have been asked 
most often in discussions of this issue: 
</P>
<P>
 * Can the CRA use eminent domain to take people's property from them?  
</P>
<P>
 The CRA is not required to include eminent domain in its plans, but 
historically it has done so. Its officials usually claim it is needed as an 
enforcement tool to implement CRA plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * How soon would recovery money be available?  
</P>
<P>
 In 14 months, on Jan. 1, 1996, and it could be longer. The law does not allow 
the CRA to sell bonds in anticipation of the increased property taxes until 
those taxes actually start to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 * What resources could achieve the same goal without the CRA?  
</P>
<P>
 There are many, including FEMA grants and Small Business Administration loans. 
Many people who were initially turned down for these funds have reapplied and 
received them. The city has recently approved $325 million in loans to help fix 
up properties. Condominium owners may be eligible for up to $35,000 per unit. 
The federal government has an additional $2.3 million set aside for blighted 
areas. There is $18 million in citywide housing funds. FEMA has set aside $2.8 
million for "ghost towns." So far the federal government has allocated $5.5 
billion, and insurance companies have paid out $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * How much damage cannot be repaired by insurance, FEMA grants, SBA loans or 
city and state grants?  
</P>
<P>
 Very little. Most, though not all, Valley properties are being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 * The CRA would have the power to force property owners to repair or replace 
buildings that are becoming a blight on the community. Do such powers already 
exist?  
</P>
<P>
 Yes. Most obviously, the city can condemn property. Short of that, ordinances 
prohibit property from becoming a hazard. The city has been demolishing 
buildings for months. 
</P>
<P>
 * Could the CRA dictate the use to which property could be put?  
</P>
<P>
 That depends on the plan in each individual council district. However, land 
use is controlled by community and general plans. Changing the use of land is a 
big question in some areas. For example, vacancy rates in multifamily rental 
units in some Valley areas are nearly 20% and some apartment owners may choose 
to defer rebuilding until the market provides them a larger supply of 
prospective tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 I am continually told by people that they are afraid of the power of the 
Community Redevelopment Agency. It's healthy for Valley residents to be 
skeptical about matters that could significantly affect their property and 
their lives. I hope they fully participate in the process of making this 
long-lasting decision. Redevelopment Hearings

LIKE RESIDENTS, THE COUNCIL SHOULD HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE LAW; YAROSLAVSKY'S 
PROPOSAL TO RAISE THE HEIGHT OF A BUILDING BY FIVE FEET -- IN VIOLATION OF THE 
VENTURA BOULEVARD SPECIFIC PLAN -- WOULD SET A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALFRED E. F. STERN, Alfred E. F. Stern is a member of the Ventura-Woodman 
Committee of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few years ago we decided to have a carport built at the foot of our 
driveway. As building began, an inspector drove up and measured the distance 
between the edge of our driveway and our neighbor's house. He ordered us to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have the necessary space between his house and your structure," he 
said. "You can't build that close." 
</P>
<P>
 Our argument that we were only a foot off had no merit in his book. "It's 
still a structure," he said. "A foot is still a foot. It's the law." For a 
private citizen and a conscientious inspector, the law prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut to more recent times. A committee of carefully selected citizens was 
appointed to develop a plan that would maintain the pleasant atmosphere of 
Ventura Boulevard through a Specific Plan while permitting moderate growth. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of citizen and community meetings from Woodland Hills to 
Studio City, the City Council enacted what it considered the best of the ideas 
offered. Then, with much fanfare, it made the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan 
the law of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Now City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky has decided he and the other council 
members are above the law that prevents private citizens from infringing on 
their neighbor's proximity by a foot. He is asking the council to ignore the 
law the council itself passed by raising the height of a building planned on 
Ventura Boulevard near Woodman Avenue by five illegal feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is the block that once housed the Scene of the Crime bookstore, the block 
for which a city-supported senior-citizen, low-income housing project is being 
proposed with Yaroslavsky's backing. On Wednesday, the council is to take the 
crucial step of voting on a low-interest loan for the developer. 
</P>
<P>
 It is against the law. Nowhere in the City Charter do members of the City 
Council have more rights than private citizens to break the law. Actions of 
this sort are exactly why the public is right in losing faith in its 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan goes through, those five illegal feet will create a precedent. 
They will open a hole that would make the Raider and Ram offenses' mouths 
water. Hence forth, the lawyers representing builders wanting to exceed the 
plan's limits will win every time, because despite the pious protests on the 
part of the city, a precedent will have been established that courts will not 
be able to deny. So much for years of planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodman-Ventura Committee of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. is not 
against a building on Ventura Boulevard between Woodman and Ventura Canyon 
avenues. It opposes council members' breaking the law to attain a favor for 
special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee questions the validity of placing a senior citizen housing 
development directly on Ventura Boulevard, with its 24-hour-a-day noisy traffic 
and high incidence of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 For those living near the block, the building's plan for parking displays 
severe shortcomings. The builder proposes 96 parking spots, up from 89 that 
were proposed until the committee pointed out the dereliction but still fewer 
than needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a proposal to Mayor Richard Riordan in July entitled "Findings of 
Consistency," the city Planning Department recommended that an additional 
one-fourth of a parking space be made available per unit for guest parking. 
That would increase the required number to 116. Fewer would mean more street 
parking, contrary to the interests of businesses and homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city's so-called mitigated negative declaration, required by the 
California Environmental Quality Act to justify projects that will cause no 
problems, claims there will be "no significant effect on the environment" from 
the apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is so, it is curious that the Housing Department was slow in releasing 
to the committee significant documents relating to the project. It makes one 
suspicious that they have something to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Yaroslavsky and the Housing Department have essentially declared 
this project a good one, despite its violations, discrepancies and hiding from 
the public facts relating to the environment. They are using every possible 
means to push through the $2.4-million land acquisition loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The council vote will come just before Yaroslavsky moves on to the county 
Board of Supervisors, leaving the public with a questionable project costing 
2.4 million federal dollars for a mixed-use building that violates the law. 
</P>
<P>
 With this going on, the public has a right to wonder: Is this a government for 
the people?

REVITALIZATION DEMANDS IMAGINATION; NEW PROGRAM TO IMPROVE AREAS INCLUDING 
DOWNTOWN SUN VALLEY IS PROMISING. BUT CREATIVE PLANNING IS NEEDED TO MAKE THE 
MOST OF OUTSIDE FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRANDELL, John Crandell of Shadow Hills is a landscape architect and 
vice president of the L.A. Millennium Project. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new effort organized by City Hall holds out the promise of significant 
improvement of run-down commercial streets through several Los Angeles 
neighborhoods, including the central business district of Sun Valley here in 
the northeast San Fernando Valley. However, making the best use of outside 
funding will require imaginative planning in addition to simply fixing things 
up as they now exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, known as the Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative, or LANI, will 
infuse $2 million to $5 million in federal transportation money into each of 
eight commercial zones over the next two years. The ostensible purpose is to 
improve storefronts and sidewalk environments. But the real goal ought to be a 
long-term boost in economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Valley's affected street is a shabby stretch of Sunland Boulevard from the 
Golden State Freeway south to Strathern Avenue. Bisected by the Southern 
Pacific/Metrolink railroad tracks, it shows the effects of four decades of 
economic decline, demographic shifts, rapid changes in merchandising practices 
and retail services, and the disadvantage of an aging building stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The project needs an aggressive and comprehensive planning effort aimed toward 
a more varied mix of activities than the low-end services and convenience 
retailing which now predominate. The depth of the commercial properties along 
both sides of the street is shallow. Space for reconfiguration and additional 
off-street parking is severely limited. It will surely be a challenge to 
contend with the insufficient parking, traffic bottlenecks and overriding image 
of economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The most basic question will be whether to pursue a relatively timid, 
superficial approach or begin to deal with or analyze the area on a more basic 
level. The greatest mistake would be to spend this newfound Clintonesque 
largess on a short-sighted make-over -- i.e., new street furnishings and 
building facades. 
</P>
<P>
 What will be the long-term value of streetscape improvement if basic problems 
are ignored? What condition would a prettified streetscape be in two or three 
years without thriving economic activity? Any effort that stresses a 
short-sighted spruce-up and ignores outside investment ought to be suspect.  
</P>
<P>
 Good planning would entice Sun Valley's citizens to shop, hang out and spend 
money locally. A more interesting mix of retail and entertainment activities 
would require greater depth to the commercial frontage along Sunland Boulevard. 
A limited amount of rezoning would be needed to accommodate new commercial 
floor plans. Replacement housing could be imaginatively accommodated by 
constructing rental units above ground-floor shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to establish a distinctive civic identity anywhere in the vast, 
anonymous expanse of the San Fernando Valley is problematic at best. Should all 
storefronts in Sun Valley have a bland, uniform appearance? Or might a novel, 
expressive style better convey a distinctive identity? Artists can work with 
architects to conceive a new look for building facades. 
</P>
<P>
 So how to begin with things as they are on Sunland Boulevard? One glance at an 
existing produce store on the west side of the thoroughfare excites the 
imagination: A bright new pavilion for allotted retailing of eye-popping 
California produce could become a community focal point and present a colorful 
display to passing motorists. It could make for an attractive interpretation of 
Broadway's Grand Central Market and draw tourists to the northeast Valley, 
perhaps with an adjacent courtyard for al fresco dining and entertainment. 
Collateral types of entertainment would reinforce and extend the daily hubbub 
into long evening hours. 
</P>
<P>
 What sort of process is being used to develop public consensus? The impersonal 
collecting of opinions by distributing questionnaires inherently limits the 
interest of citizens and their direct participation. Events open to anyone will 
generate more public participation. In the planning and design trades, these 
events are known as the environmental workshop, a creative process pioneered by 
designers James Burns and Lawrence Halprin. Such a workshop is a group exercise 
in which everyone is enticed to use drawings, models and other media, community 
inventories and market surveys, to prepare a realistic future scenario for a 
community's environment.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon and the participants in Sun Valley's Neighborhood 
Initiative should resist doing an immediate quick fix while ignoring the 
long-term advantages of a more sophisticated analysis involving land-use 
planning.

JIM MURRAY: HIS BEST ADVICE HAS OFTEN BEEN IGNORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of my biggest problems on this job, it grieves me to admit, is I'm always 
trying to help people. Usually, people who don't want help. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, baseball managers. I don't know how many baseball managers whose 
job I have tried to make easier with sound advice on when to change pitchers, 
whom to send up to pinch-hit, and so on. Look! Somebody's got to do it, right? 
After all, who told Jack Nicklaus he had his right hand too far over on the 
shaft. And who asked Carl Lewis if it wouldn't do him some good to take off on 
the left foot? 
</P>
<P>
 Football's the same. I mean, everyone's got to set his sights on some form of 
public service, and mine includes helping out football coaches, giving them the 
benefit of my vast experience in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't exactly describe their reaction as gratitude. Annoyance would be 
more like it, not to mention downright hostility.  
</P>
<P>
 Still and all, one has to rise above this. The public weal is more important.  
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, I would like to reprise a few of the suggestions I have made to 
football mentors over the years to make their jobs easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few of the Murray Postulates to Better Football: 1. Never punt on 
fourth down inside the other guys' 50-yard line.  
</P>
<P>
 I never make much headway with the coaching brain trust on this one. It is 
written in stone someplace that you always punt on fourth down -- unless you 
are close enough to go for a field goal. In other words, on fourth down, kick! 
</P>
<P>
 Well, perhaps you noticed last Sunday what happened when the Houston Oilers 
had fourth down and six inches to go on the Raider 49-yard line when they 
punted the ball. It went into the end zone. The Raiders then took the ball and 
drove 80 yards to a touchdown in 16 plays and chewed up 8 minutes 51 seconds 
off the clock.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Murray Postulate is, you can always get six inches. All the 
quarterback has to do is fall forward. Since Houston lost this game by three 
points, this was a crushing decision. Among other things, a coach's decision 
that his team cannot be trusted to make six inches is devastating to morale. 
But never mind the six inches. I never punt the ball inside the other team's 
territory, even if there's six yards.  
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter of Sunday's game, trailing by three, with 13 minutes 
left, Houston had the ball on the Raider 44-yard line, fourth and one. Again, 
the Oilers punted. The ball went out of bounds (see below) on the nine. When 
Houston next got the ball, they were on their own 14. They had lost 42 yards. 
Also the game. 2. Punting the ball out of bounds inside the other team's 
five-yard line is the most overrated play in football.  
</P>
<P>
 How many times have you seen a team take this ostensibly poor field position 
and drive 98 yards for a touchdown? And, do you ever remember a pro team 
staying down in this claustrophobic position? 
</P>
<P>
 They used to call this the "coffin corner" kick back in the old collegiate 
days. But the facts of the matter are, with the pros, it's often the other guys 
whose throats begin to rattle. The problem is, the defense has, what, 95 yards 
to cover? They have to spread out all over the field. Give John Elway or Joe 
Montana a defense thinned out all over the place and he doesn't stay in the 
"coffin corner" long. Montana has made a living throwing touchdowns from these 
places, even in Super Bowls.  
</P>
<P>
 "Good field position" for the pros can often mean their own three. "Bad field 
position" can often be the other guys' 15. It's harder to move the ball against 
a bunched-up defense. 3. Never, never plunge into the line on first and goal 
inside the other team's five-yard line.  
</P>
<P>
 Talk about bad field position! You are standing there looking at about two 
tons of football beef on the hoof, bunched together and about as impenetrable 
as the Bermuda Triangle. Yet, 10 out of 10 pro coaches will call a line plunge 
on first down in this situation. A tank couldn't get through.  
</P>
<P>
 They will try it again. Then, on third down, they will try something less 
Neanderthal but just as predictable and too late -- a pass, an end run.  
</P>
<P>
 It is Murray's Immutable Third Law that, if they tried that end run on first 
down, the ballcarrier could go in untouched by human hands.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the great Bill Walsh fell victim to this kind of coach-think in a Super 
Bowl against Cincinnati. He ended up even missing the fourth-down field goal.  
</P>
<P>
 Try to remember, the German Army didn't try to go through the Maginot Line. It 
went around it. 4. In an obvious passing situation, particularly near the goal 
line, the quarterback doesn't have to pass. he can probably walk into the end 
zone.  
</P>
<P>
 Happens every Sunday. With everyone guessing pass, nobody bothers with a pass 
rush. Everybody peels back to knock down the throw. The quarterback is as alone 
as a guy waiting for a bus. He could help himself to 10, 15 yards with a cane.  
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, he's such a slave to custom, he will still stand there, helplessly 
looking for someone to get open. The truth is, he's open! 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter of last Sunday's Raider game, the Oilers had the ball on 
the Los Angeles six-yard line. The Houston quarterback stood like the Statue of 
Liberty, looking for somebody to get open.  
</P>
<P>
 He suddenly noticed he was as alone as a night watchman. He pulled the ball 
down and set sail for the end zone. He went in like a guy walking his dog. 5. 
In the late stages of the game, the defense should beef up the pass rush, not 
abandon it.  
</P>
<P>
 They used to call the maneuvers they used in the late minutes of a close game 
the "prevent defense." 
</P>
<P>
 It was laughable. Quarterbacks loved it. You could see how silly it was when 
you would notice that two teams that had struggled for 58 minutes to a 10-10 
tie or such, would suddenly score twice each in the last two minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Coaches seldom saw a connection between the two, the prevent defense and the 
sudden high scoring.  
</P>
<P>
 It was strange because teams with big leads would always send their pass rush 
in with reckless abandon, blitzing, stunting or looping. Which would render the 
passing game totally ineffective.  
</P>
<P>
 But if the game was close, they would put in their "nickel" and "dime" and 
"prevent" defenses.  
</P>
<P>
 The pass rush would be nonexistent. The linebackers wouldn't dare blitz. The 
game would suddenly become high-scoring, the sack would become extinct.  
</P>
<P>
 Murray's Law is, put five men on the quarterback -- a pass rush and a blitzing 
cornerback -- and you won't have to put two men on Jerry Rice. Get to the 
passer and you can play Jerry Rice man to man. Not even he can catch what isn't 
thrown.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, these suggestions are offered free of charge, and worth it. I could fax 
them to Art Shell or Chuck Knox. But I don't think I will. I got to go. Michael 
Jordan needs me.

BY GEORGE, IT'S ONE FOR AGED; BOXING: TWENTY YEARS AFTER LOSING TITLE TO ALI, 
FOREMAN, 45, SHOCKS MOORER WITH 10TH-ROUND KNOCKOUT. 
</P>

<P>
 It was one-punch blast from the past, and after it landed, everything was 
chaos and uproar, devastation and jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
 A single historic, shattering punch knocked Michael Moorer out and, for 10 
wild seconds and beyond, sent the boxing world flying off of its axis. 
</P>
<P>
 George Foreman, his left eye badly swollen, his 45-year-old legs giving way 
but his heart and power unquestioned, threw a 10th-round right hand that landed 
on Moorer's chin Saturday night and toppled him backward to the floor, arms 
splayed and feet in the air, for the 10-second count and many more. 
</P>
<P>
 With that self-described "hamhock to the chin" at 2:03 of the 10th, Foreman 
made the past the future, altered the course of boxing history, and became the 
oldest heavyweight champion who ever lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with the aftershocks still rolling through the MGM Grand Garden and his 
brother Roy recovered after fainting amid the celebration, the old man, the 
International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Assn. champion, spoke about 
his past, his hope and his joy. 
</P>
<P>
 The future he left for others to contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been heavyweight champion before, so I know the feeling," George Foreman 
said. "But this has been the greatest moment of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything you desire, you make it happen. It's like the song, when you wish 
upon a star, your dreams come true. Well, look at me tonight. I have power and 
no one can take my punches. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, I took it easy, then I mounted the punishment. He couldn't take it any 
more, and he never should've stayed in front of me. I'm a straight right-handed 
puncher and sooner or later I hit you." 
</P>
<P>
 What's next for the man who came into the ring as the most popular fighter in 
the sport and left it as its most unspeakably dramatic? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking it one day a time," Foreman said. "My main goal was to be champion 
of the world once again, and stop being introduced as the former heavyweight 
champ of the world. Now, I will always be introduced as the heavyweight 
champion of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman wasn't speaking about future opponents, but he surely could seek and 
gain title defenses against anybody he and his promoter, Bob Arum, choose, 
including Mike Tyson in a bout that would almost certainly be the most 
profitable ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman (73-4, 68 knockouts) entered the fight with strong public support and 
a puncher's chance against the 26-year-old, previously undefeated Moorer. 
Foreman entered the ring to a raucous standing ovation and covered in a plain 
sweat jacket and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer received scattered boos and applause, and came in dressed regally in a 
bright yellow robe. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Moorer began looking comfortable and in control, and kept dominating up 
until the last blast, even the doubts about his shaky chin seemed to evaporate 
simply because Foreman could not strike him cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
 That only set up the drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman, at times in the early going, looked slow and unable to find Moorer 
with the all-important right -- similar to the way he lost to Tommy Morrison 17 
months ago in his last fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-handed Moorer spliced Foreman's front attack with snapping right jabs 
that swelled up Foreman's left eye and in-and-out movement that brought his 
right hard onto Foreman's chin several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer scored with a heavy overhand right in the third round, sending Foreman 
backpedaling. It would not be the last time Moorer's crisp blows staggered 
Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man is powerful, he is very strong," Foreman said of Moorer. "When he hit 
me on top of my head, it shook all through my body. He never hurt me" 
</P>
<P>
 According to CompuBox Inc. statistics, through the first nine rounds, Moorer 
landed 243 jabs to Foreman's 103, and connected with 348 total punches -- 149 
more than Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Moorer: "I never thought of backing off." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the knockout, Moorer led by five points on two judges' cards 
and by one point on the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't even matter," Foreman said of all the rounds he knew he was losing. 
"I wasn't ever going for the score. I was keeping the jab up and waiting, 
watching his face." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the fight, Moorer's trainer, Teddy Atlas, warned his fighter, 28 
pounds lighter than Foreman, to take better care to circle to his right and 
stay away from Foreman's potent right hand, the main weapon that has given 
Foreman the greatest knockout record in the history of the heavyweight 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 With his left eye almost totally swollen -- "I didn't feel urgency, I felt 
half-blind," Foreman said -- the ninth was Foreman's most inactive round as 
Moorer bounced tens of jabs off his face. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foreman, sensing something, opened the 10th firing his right and caught 
Moorer twice in the first moments of the round. Moorer recovered, then appeared 
to relax and stepped slowly backward after fending off a soft Foreman parry 
almost one minute into the round. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman, pouncing on the chance he had been awaiting, stuck a left jab into 
Moorer's face, then released the most important punch of his life, a punch that 
struck with a dull thud and a monstrous audience roar. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't see the punch coming," Atlas said. "It was the best punch George 
threw all night. That's what we were afraid of." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Moorer (35-1), whose motivation to fight has been questioned 
before, said he'd have to think about whether he'll fight again. And he was 
calm and matter-of-fact explaining the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got lackadaisical," Moorer said. "I just got caught. It's part of boxing 
and I'm going to have to live with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was effective, but I wasn't as effective as George was. George came out and 
accomplished a task. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there would be a day when there would be a winner and there would be a 
loser. What can I say? I did my best. The only pain I feel is knowing my son 
was crying afterwards," Moorer said of 2-year-old Michael Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman, who first won the heavyweight title on Jan. 22, 1973, over Joe 
Frazier, then lost it on Oct. 30, 1974, to Muhammad Ali, said he set up Moorer 
by throwing the pawing rights after hard left jabs throughout the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman missed with a couple of huge, looping overhand rights in the eighth 
round, and lost his balance briefly later in the round when Moorer's foot 
tangled with his own. 
</P>
<P>
 But the seeds of a huge upset were being sewn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if I caught him with one that had a little body English, he'd go 
down," Foreman said. "On that final punch, I knew he wasn't getting up. 
</P>
<P>
 "On this planet, we will always know that the athlete of all athletes is 
between 45 and 55. So all of you out there thinking, 'I don't know if I can do 
it any more . . . ' 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can do it, you know you can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Foreman spoke a few words from "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," and ended: 
"If bluebirds can fly over the rainbow, why oh why can't I?"

MIKE DOWNEY: HE'S OVER THE RAINBOW, NOT OVER THE HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Something happened here Saturday night to make all of us feel a little 
younger, a little stronger, a little more willing to believe that life can get 
better rather than worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The aging bull, George Foreman, became the heavyweight champion of the world 
-- again. No, seriously . 
</P>
<P>
 Bring back Floyd Patterson. Call up Ali and see when he's available. Roll 
over, Joe Louis, and tell Marciano the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Paunchy and punchy and slow as gravy, this 45-year-old boxer-comedian stood 
inside the showroom of a Vegas hotel with no gags to tell and no place to hide, 
his pudgy face puffy but his heartbeat strong. Old George took licks from a 
26-year-old champion that would make younger men stagger and bleed. Yet quit he 
would not, nor would he fall, nor even clinch. 
</P>
<P>
 And then something happened. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:10 p.m. on the button, the Rev. George Foreman socked Michael Moorer on 
the button. It wasn't the right hand of God, necessarily, but it was indeed a 
miraculous old one-two. 
</P>
<P>
 The young champ collapsed to the canvas. The old challenger sagged backward 
against a nearby turnbuckle. More than 12,000 eyewitnesses inside the MGM Grand 
reacted as if they had just seen the cowardly lion from Oz discover courage at 
last. As one they arose, palms pressed against their temples in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 A referee counted to 10. And the Rev. George sank to his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed and prayed that way for several minutes. His brother, Roy Foreman, 
fainted and had to be carried away. Everything happened so suddenly, so fast, 
no one was able to prepare for it. Nine rounds into the night, none of those 
who implored Foreman to lash out with one great decisive punch actually 
expected him to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer finally got back on his feet. And so did the Rev. George, who arose to 
his new exalted stature, quoting Scripture and lyrics from children's fairy 
tales. 
</P>
<P>
 By evening's end, Foreman, his round face merry again, actually began singing: 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere over the rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Way up high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Happy little bluebirds fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why-oh, why-oh, why can't I?" 
</P>
<P>
 As they say at MGM, that's entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Into the arena Foreman trudged, cocooned within a black robe and gray-hooded 
sweatshirt, looking for all the world like a tired old-timer on his way to a 
Turkish bath. He was someone from a different world, a different era, as was 
the hand-chosen tune that accompanied George on his way to the ring, a sweet 
Sam Cooke rendition of "If I Had a Hammer." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the world, Foreman appeared to have no business being here. This 
seemed particularly true once Moorer emerged, taut and toned, supple and 
unmarked inside his golden garments. This was youth on the hoof, out to push 
old George into a retirement community where he belonged. 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside Foreman in his corner stood Angelo Dundee, the trainer 20 years ago 
of the man, Ali, who had humiliated George and shorn him of his crown. Dundee 
amused listeners here Saturday morning with remembrance of that long- ago time, 
of his welcoming American visitors to the African continent by extending a 
handshake and saying: "Don't eat any monkey meat." 
</P>
<P>
 Now here he was, training Foreman, the man who kept his weight under control 
even though he finally confessed Saturday to have done much of his training at 
Wendy's, eating not simian but double burgers with cheese. Foreman felt he 
needed his strength, having fought nobody for 17 months. His waist was such 
that throughout Saturday's fight, Dundee and the referee, Joe Cortez, kept 
tugging at Foreman's waistband, pulling it above the brace he wore underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Most everybody at ringside seemed to be pulling for George. Present were young 
and old Hollywood: Robert DeNiro with Joe Pesci, there watching an old fighter 
who didn't know how to quit; and Tony Curtis and Michael Crawford, keeping his 
eye on an old phantom; Denzel Washington and Forest Whitaker, and Jeff Goldblum 
with Laura Dern, still studying dinosaurs. There were athletes old and young, 
Walter Payton to Ken Griffey Jr., wondering whether old George could really 
pull this off. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for one round, although one of the three judges did score that one for 
George. Not for two rounds, as Foreman, pawing like a kitten, going backward 
more often than forward, did little damage to Moorer's face or chest. 
Perspiration sprayed as Foreman took a hard right hand to the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Was George weakening? Visibly. But was he game? Was he ever! He kept giving 
the audience its money's worth. He wasn't in this one just for the paycheck. A 
flurry by Moorer near the end of Round 4 could have persuaded George to call it 
a night, but he wouldn't and didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer peppered him with right-hand leads. Lower and lower grew Foreman's 
gloves, and he was tagged late in the fifth round by punches that bounced off 
his gloves earlier on. The good news, though, was that George was not bleeding 
and seemed energetic. He stood between rounds rather than sat, and was waiting 
for Moorer when each new round began. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd came alive, chanting "George! George!" And at 8 o'clock he gave 
everyone something to shout about. He smacked Moorer a good one. But the champ 
responded with an uppercut that could have ended things, sending George's 
spittle flying. Moments later he stumbled across the ring, as though the end 
were near. 
</P>
<P>
 It was. 
</P>
<P>
 The end for Moorer. Because George Foreman knocked him on his back. And above 
the champion's head, happy little bluebirds flew.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON FIND COUGARS SOFT AS POWDER, 23-10; USC: QUARTERBACK AND 
RECEIVER COMBINE FOR THREE SCORES IN VICTORY THAT PUTS OREGON IN DRIVER'S SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the aftermath, talking about the wreckage of Washington State's proud 
defense, the wrecker himself, Keyshawn Johnson, spoke.  
</P>
<P>
 "Their defensive backs are kind of small, and I'm tall, and when I get my body 
in a position where I have the ball and they can't tackle me. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Keyshawn Johnson didn't have to say much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty simple stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Big guy playing little guys. 
</P>
<P>
 In a big-game receiving performance that rivals any by Johnnie Morton, 
Johnson's All-American predecessor, Johnson scored all the touchdowns and 
accounted for 145 yards in a 23-10 USC victory over Washington State on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's fourth victory in a row boosted the Trojans (6-2) to 5-1 in the Pacific 
10, with a game next Saturday against Arizona in the Coliseum. Arizona is 7-2, 
5-1 after beating California, 13-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon, which owns victories over both USC and Arizona, is also 5-1 after a 
34-10 victory over Arizona State. The Ducks are in the driver's seat in the 
Rose Bowl derby, with games remaining against Stanford and Oregon State. If 
Oregon wins those two, the Ducks go to Pasadena.  
</P>
<P>
 But late Saturday afternoon, in a happy USC locker room, no one seemed much 
focused on Oregon's fortunes. John Robinson's team had made big plays on both 
sides of the ball and knocked off one of the nation's best defensive teams.  
</P>
<P>
 This was one the Trojans enjoyed immensely.  
</P>
<P>
 It was achieved before an announced crowd of 36,686, but there seemed to be 
more no-shows than that in 40,000-seat Martin Stadium. Foul weather had been 
predicted, but the game was played under clear skies, with temperatures in the 
mid-40s.  
</P>
<P>
 In pregame warm-ups, Cougar fans molded Friday's snow from under their seats 
into hard snowballs and pelted the Trojans, despite pleas from the 
public-address announcer to stop.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the prime targets was Robinson, who presented himself in full profile 
before several thousand students, smiling all the while. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to thank the Washington State students for throwing all those 
snowballs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fat guy like me, standing right in front of them and not one of them could 
hit me." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior quarterback Rob Johnson, playing his first complete game since Sept. 
24, had a big day, connecting with the 6-4, 210-pound Keyshawn Johnson eight 
times for 145 yards and touchdowns plays of 13, eight and 64 yards. Another one 
of 64 yards was called back on a penalty in the second quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 Keyshawn Johnson's three touchdowns tied the USC single-game record for a 
receiver, held now by five players. 
</P>
<P>
 "He killed us," Cougar Coach Mike Price said of Keyshawn Johnson, a junior who 
has caught 36 passes for 742 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought Ken Grace was going to be SC's great receiver this year, and along 
comes that guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson saluted both his catcher and pitcher.  
</P>
<P>
 "Keyshawn won a lot of individual matchups today," he said. "He's become a 
dominating receiver, a J.J. Stokes or Johnnie Morton kind of player." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Rob Johnson's 20-for-31, 327-yard performance (his eighth 300-yard game), 
Robinson said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob Johnson played a great football game -- great because he showed a lot of 
courage taking some big hits, for bringing the team back after that touchdown 
was called back." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State played its usual attacking, aggressive defensive game that 
shuts down run games, but leaves its 5-foot-10 cornerbacks vulnerable. In other 
words, they played into his quarterback's hands, Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They put their corners in a position where they have to cover a big, fast 
receiver all day and that's hard to to," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Typical was the fourth-quarter Johnson & Johnson play that knocked Washington 
State (6-3, 4-2) out of the Rose Bowl race.  
</P>
<P>
 With USC owning a 13-10 lead and 11:09 left, Rob Johnson sent Keyshawn Johnson 
a high ball that required him to go above two smaller defensive backs, both of 
whom tumbled to the ground as Johnson made the catch, broke a tackle and 
completed the 64-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson walked off the field with arms raised in the touchdown signal, and 
USC's bench went wild. Soon after, the crowd began filing out the tunnels.  
</P>
<P>
 "When a defense pressures you like that, there's all kinds of things a 
quarterback can do," Trojan offensive coordinator Mike Riley said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have many running yards (68), but they were effective runs -- it 
made them respect the run. And at the same time, it really set up Rob's passes 
to Keyshawn." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rob Johnson, who was sacked three times and took numerous hits as he 
threw the ball: "We were frustrated at halftime (USC led, 7-3). We felt the 
score should have been 28-3. Keyshawn was our big-play guy, he came up huge. 
He's a big guy who can run and he's mentally tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback sat out half of the Oregon and Stanford games and all of the 
Oregon State and Cal games with an ankle sprain.  
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts," he said of his right ankle. "It'll bug me the rest of the season, 
but I can play on it,"  
</P>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Tony Boselli agreed that USC's 68 rushing yards were big 
enough. Washington State led the nation going into the game by giving up an 
average of 58 yards per game.  
</P>
<P>
 And USC's rushing yardage included 36 yards in losses in four sacks of 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we weren't going to get the 10-to 15-yard runs, but we wanted those 
three-, five- and seven-yard runs, so they'd have to respect it and give Rob 
the chance to pick them apart," Boselli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State, trying to beat USC for only the third time since 1934, had a 
3-0 first-quarter lead, a quarter in which the Trojans fumbled for the first 
time in 15 quarters. Wide receiver Grace fumbled at the Cougar 21 after a 
57-yard pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans went ahead, 7-3, on the second quarter's first play, a 13-yard 
pass to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 It ended that way at the half, then Johnson & Johnson combined on an 
eight-yard slant early in the third quarter for a 13-3 lead. Cole Ford's 
point-after kick was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State's offense got its only touchdown on the fourth quarter's 
first play, a Chad Davis-to-Eric Moore pass play that covered 33 yards and made 
it 13-10. 
</P>
<P>
 But after that, Washington State crossed the 50 only once, reaching the USC 47 
and only then when the game was out of reach.  
</P>
<P>
 The 64-yard game-breaker by Keyshawn Johnson was good for a 20-10 lead, and 
Ford kicked a 37-yard field goal with 5:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The field goal was set up by USC's catch of the year. Wide receiver Ed Hervey 
made a leaping catch of a Rob Johnson ball on a 44-yard play that put the 
Trojans at the Cougar 22.  
</P>
<P>
 Same formula, same result: 
</P>
<P>
 Hervey is 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 His defender on the play, cornerback Torey Hunter, is 5-9.

LATE ARRIVAL IS NO CAUSE FOR CONCERN; BREEDERS' CUP: ARKANSAS DERBY WINNER 
TAKES THE $3-MILLION CLASSIC ON A DAY OF SURPRISES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Breeders' Cup horse that arrived last at Churchill Downs ran first 
Saturday as Concern beat Tabasco Cat by a neck in the $3-million Classic, 
ending on a high note a long year of unfulfilled promise for the 3-year-old 
colt from Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Dick Small's style is to ship a horse to a race at a late hour, and by 
van instead of plane. He made no exception with Concern, even though the 
late-running son of Broad Brush was appearing in the most important stake of 
his 21-race career. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10 1/2-hour trip brought Concern and the trainer to Kentucky at 3 a.m. 
Friday, long after all the other Breeders' Cup horses had settled in and been 
tested during workouts over the Churchill Downs track. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern did all of his Breeders' Cup preparations at Pimlico, where he worked 
a mile on Monday. "I find that most horses do better in their own 
surroundings," Small said. "It's better not to disrupt their daily rhythms." 
</P>
<P>
 Small played it even closer to the vest when Concern ran in the Travers in 
August. For that race, the horse was driven to Upstate New York and arrived at 
4 a.m. on the day of the race, about 13 hours before post time. He lost by a 
neck to Holy Bull, the probable horse of the year who didn't run in the 
Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Being beaten by necks and running second and third have been Concern's style, 
a rut that ended in time for his owner-breeder, Robert Meyerhoff, to collect a 
purse of $1.56 million, more than half a million dollars more than his colt had 
earned from all his previous labor. Concern went into the Classic with only 
three victories -- and seven seconds and eight thirds -- in 20 races, and this 
year he had been beaten seven consecutive times since winning the Arkansas 
Derby by a neck in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "He still had an extended string of some pretty good races," Small said, 
explaining what business Concern had in the Breeders' Cup. "He had run well 
enough lately, well enough in some races that the horse probably thought that 
he had won." 
</P>
<P>
 Concern's $17 win payoff came on an overcast 70-degree day before 71,671, a 
record Breeders' Cup crowd. What went before included three other upsets: 
</P>
<P>
 -- One Dreamer's $96.20 payoff for her neck victory over Heavenly Prize in the 
$1-million Distaff. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tikkanen's $35.20 price for his 1 1/2-length victory over Hatoof in the 
$2-million Turf. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Barathea's $22.80 victory in the Mile, a race the colt had mangled the year 
before with a first-turn right turn into a pack of horses at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 The other $1-million races better resembled form. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Wayne Lukas, who also trains Tabasco Cat, won the Juvenile with Timber 
Country and the Juvenile Fillies with Flanders for his 11th and 12th Breeders' 
Cup victories, and favored Cherokee Run wore down Soviet Problem in the stretch 
to win the Sprint by a head. 
</P>
<P>
 The big disappointments of the afternoon were Lure and Paradise Creek, both 
odds-on choices in the two grass races. 
</P>
<P>
 Lure, trying to become the first horse to win three Breeders' Cup races, 
couldn't overcome a No. 14 post position in the Mile and finished ninth. 
Paradise Creek, beaten only once all year, led the Turf with less than an 
eighth of a mile left, but lacked the stamina for his first 1 1/2-mile start 
and finished third, beaten by three lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 With Timber Country and Flanders, Pat Day was a two-time winner, giving him 
eight victories in 11 Breeders' Cups and moving him into first place, one ahead 
of Eddie Delahoussaye and Laffit Pincay. But Jerry Bailey upstaged all of the 
jockeys, using Concern for his third victory in the Classic. Bailey, 37, 
clicked with Arcangues, the 133-1 shot last year, and he was also aboard Black 
Tie Affair at Churchill Downs in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey is president of the Jockeys' Guild, which was foiled by the Churchill 
Downs stewards, who wouldn't allow the riders to wear "47" stickers on their 
boots to honor that number of former riders who are permanently disabled. 
Bailey and other jockeys, ignoring direct questions about the races at least 
six times during NBC's telecast, still plugged their intentions. Jockeys were 
able to wear the stickers in most other racing states Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Bailey reached the winner's circle with Concern, he was wearing a 
white baseball cap with a "47" sticker on the front. "Hi to the 47," he said on 
television. "All the guys out there who are sitting and watching." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Bailey said, "I think it was a stretch of the rules for the stewards 
not to let us do what we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Many racetrack executives characterized the "47" campaign as an effort by the 
jockeys to secure public sympathy in their efforts to get the tracks to renew a 
contract for hospitalization and accident insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey was in the kind of a spot that might cause an accident, when Concern 
tried to squeeze between Millkom and Devil His Due on the far turn, with 
three-eighths of a mile to go. 
</P>
<P>
 He yelled at Smith, who was on a tiring horse, to make room. "Mike let me slip 
through," Bailey said. "That was the only queasy part of the whole race." 
</P>
<P>
 Concern was last in the 14-horse field after a half-mile. While Bertrando set 
fast early fractions, Bailey and his mount were content to trail by almost 13 
lengths. Midway down the backstretch, Concern started picking up horses. Bailey 
won from far back with Arcangues, and his 1993 Kentucky Derby victory here was 
with another late runner, Sea Hero, but he has never seen a one-run horse like 
Concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can do it all in 3 1/2 furlongs," Bailey said. "He made up 15-20 lengths 
just like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bertrando was through at the top of the stretch, and first Dramatic Gold, then 
Tabasco Cat, made claims for the lead. Concern passed Tabasco Cat about 20 
yards before the wire. Concern's time for 1 1/4 miles was 2:02 2/5, with 
Tabasco Cat finishing 1 1/2 lengths in front of Dramatic Gold and Soul Of The 
Matter finishing fourth, beaten by three lengths and a nose better than Best 
Pal. Devil His Due, the second choice behind Tabasco Cat, finished 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to really work hard to get by (Dramatic Gold)," Day said of Tabasco 
Cat's stretch run. "My horse really dug in. He just didn't get there." 
</P>
<P>
 After Concern's victory in the Arkansas Derby, Small skipped the Kentucky 
Derby because he thought the race came up too soon, and he and Meyerhoff wanted 
to wait for their hometown race, the Preakness at Pimlico. Concern was third in 
the Preakness, behind Tabasco Cat and Go For Gin, the Kentucky Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse has incredible acceleration," Small said. "He just explodes. His 
sire (Broad Brush) had more talent, but this horse has more concentration and 
he knows where the wire is." 
</P>
<P>
 Broad Brush, also trained by Small, raced three times at Santa Anita in 1987, 
finishing third in the Strub Stakes and winning the Santa Anita Handicap en 
route to a $2.6-million career. Small said that Concern might also go West for 
next year's Strub. The trainer will spring for a plane ride if that's the 
schedule.

RAMS CAN TALK WINNING GAME; PRO FOOTBALL: BUT WHETHER THEY CAN PLAY ONE TODAY 
AGAINST BRONCOS DEPENDS NOT ON JOE VITT'S VERBOSITY BUT ON JOHN ELWAY'S 
ABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Rams are 3-5, and aren't they always 3-5 after the first half of the 
season? They are home again in the NFC West cellar, and how do you like their 
chances in the next four weeks against the likes of the Broncos, Raiders, 49ers 
and Chargers? 
</P>
<P>
 Rally to make the playoffs? The Rams have compiled an 8-24 mark over the 
second half of the season the last four years, so why should people think this 
November and December will be any different? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what people think," said Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach. 
"They can all go to the beach, Disneyland, support the hockey team. I don't 
give a damn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing Denver, and I know we can absolutely beat this football team. 
We can absolutely have a great second half, and I want a great second half for 
our players. The rest of the people can have a great second half and I want a 
great second half for our players. The rest of the people can believe what they 
want to believe. Get in their Save The Rams T-shirts and work on that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good football team. This is one of the better teams I have ever 
been around, and this was a football team that was kicked in the stomach -- 
losing three games on the last play of the game. You win those three games and 
all of a sudden we're the toast of the town. We lost those three games, but 
that doesn't mean our defense stinks, or our offense stinks. We just have to 
learn to win close games down the stretch and then we will be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Vitt sleeps four nights a week on a couch at Rams Park, giving himself more 
time to better prepare the team, but still the Rams have been found wanting. 
They rank 25th on offense, last in the league in stopping the opposition on 
third down and have allowed one punt and two kickoffs to be returned for 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denver is going up against a (tough) team," Vitt said. "They better bring 
their lunch. Parity is here. This is like the NBA. If you can't win in the last 
two minutes then you are going to be (in big trouble). You have to win close 
games to be among the elite, and (quarterback) John Elway obviously knows how 
to do that. So that's going to be the challenge for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Elway, who is 1-1 against the Rams, has directed the Broncos to 25 
fourth-quarter game-winning drives during his 12 years in the league. The 
Broncos, however, have been outscored in the fourth quarter this season, 52-32, 
and their inability to keep pace has undermined their season. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver (3-5) handed San Diego its first loss two weeks ago and then whipped 
AFC Central leader Cleveland, but before that the Broncos had lost on the final 
play of the season-opener against the Chargers and then fallen in overtime a 
week later to the Jets. They had a final-play shot at tying Buffalo before 
losing, then fell victim to Joe Montana's last-minute heroics in a Monday night 
TV classic with Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were 0-4 and 10 plays away from being 3-1," Elway said. "The last four 
games we're 3-1 and we've been making those plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas the Broncos have won three of their last four, the Rams have dropped 
three of their last four. The Rams will start Chris Chandler at quarterback in 
place of Chris Miller before an anticipated crowd of 45,000 in Anaheim Stadium. 
Miller suffered a concussion two weeks ago in the Rams' last game, against New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a great bye week," Vitt said. "We haven't been like a lot of dumb 
people around the league and beaten the dog stuffings out of our players for 
two weeks. We've addressed certain areas and we're ready to have a great second 
half of the season. I'm working with some world-class athletes and this is fun. 
We're playing the second half to be 8-0. These guys have paid the price to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are expected to have sore-shouldered defensive tackle Sean Gilbert 
back in the lineup to pressure Elway, who has been sacked 24 times this season. 
The Broncos average fewer than 100 yards a game on the ground, relying 
primarily on Leonard Russell, but have big-play makers in the passing game -- 
Anthony Miller, Shannon Sharpe and Glyn Milburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elway's like a lot of quarterbacks: He thinks he can win a game by himself," 
said Jim Erkenbeck, Ram offensive line coach. "Probably the most effective way 
to play him is to let him try and win the game by himself and take away all his 
little helpers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will try to run Jerome Bettis, hog the ball and keep Elway off the 
field, but they also might be teased into throwing the ball because of Denver's 
poor play against the pass. The Broncos rank last in the league in defending 
against the pass and have surrendered 13 touchdowns via the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter," said George Dyer, Ram defensive coordinator. "At some 
point you're still going to have to face the guy and this guy is special. I've 
gone against him 18 times (with a 9-9 record) and your people have to play at 
the top of their game and hope they're as good as he is."

MORNING BRIEFING: ORIOLES' ANGELOS SAYS COVERAGE IS FOR THE BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oriole owner Peter Angelos, upset by the Baltimore Sun's perceived negative 
coverage of the hiring of farm director Syd Thrift, recently attacked columnist 
Ken Rosenthal and the newspaper's reporting.  
</P>
<P>
 He issued a press release that derided "moronic media malevolence." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has a way with words, also writing that some comments in the article 
"represent the caterwaulings of an insolent twit whose journalistic 
fulminations vilify and randomly splatter written bile upon those with whom, in 
his distorted state of mind, he disagrees." 
</P>
<P>
 So there. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the Raider record for most touchdown passes in a 
season? 
</P>
<P>
 Headstrong: Bill Hewitt, a Hall of Fame end with the Chicago Bears and 
Philadelphia Eagles, never wore a helmet, retiring in 1939.  
</P>
<P>
 When he came out of retirement to play with the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh 
"Steagles" in 1943, he had to wear one.  
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't like it," said Bucko Kilroy, a tackle who played next to Hewitt. 
"When the play was over, he'd take it off." 
</P>
<P>
 No argument: Michael Jordan, on NBA rookies commanding high salaries, such as 
Milwaukee's Glenn Robinson, who sought a $100-million contract but settled for 
$68 million: 
</P>
<P>
 "If those guys are worth $100 million, I'm worth $300 million." 
</P>
<P>
 No hesitation: As the hockey lockout continues, an Edmonton radio station 
called Oiler winger Kelly Buchberger to ask if he would tape a promo. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't home, but his wife, Karla, asked if the spot paid anything. The 
station offered $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can speak for Kelly," she said. "He'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillbilly gags: Don Ireland, who resigned as the University of Pittsburgh's 
public address announcer, had been reprimanded for comments made during the 
Pitt-West Virginia game Oct. 15, during which he directed his humor at 
Mountaineer fans.  
</P>
<P>
 Shelly Anderson of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writes that at one point 
"Ireland said there was a tractor in the parking lot with its lights on with 
the license plate 'E-I-E-I-O.' He also noted that the stadium's smoking ban 
included corncob pipes." 
</P>
<P>
 Missiles fizzled: Before the Raiders played Houston last Sunday at the 
Coliseum, Oiler defensive back Cris Dishman worried about the Raiders' 
long-range passing attack: 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think about the Raiders, I think about deep balls, deep balls and more 
deep balls," Dishman told John McLain of the Houston Chronicle. "That's why 
I've been trying to shed five pounds by not eating and staying in a sauna." 
</P>
<P>
 Dishman's fears were unfounded as the Raiders, using a tame offense, barely 
won, 17-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Different era: George Karl, coach of the Seattle SuperSonics, said that NBA 
players are like businessmen now. 
</P>
<P>
 "They practice from 10 to 12, have a meeting with their stockbrokers at 1, 
have a meeting with TNT at 2 and go out to dinner with TV hosts at 4." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Daryle Lamonica, with 34 in 1969.

CLIPPERS END POOR FOREIGN EXPERIENCE; PRO BASKETBALL: TWENTY-FIVE TURNOVERS ARE 
KEY FACTOR IN A 112-95 LOSS TO THE TRAIL BLAZERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bill Fitch, the original captain video, usually doesn't go to 
sleep after a game until he has watched a videotape of the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clippers' poor performances in their season-opening games against the 
Portland Trail Blazers in Yokohama, Japan, this weekend were enough to make 
Fitch shut off his VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing by 21 points Friday night, the Clippers lost the rematch, 112-95, 
Saturday night before a sellout crowd of 14,239 at the Yokohama Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who averaged a league-high 18 turnovers per game last season, 
have averaged 21 turnovers in their first two games, including 25 Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 There were whispers that Trail Blazer guard Clyde Drexler, a career 50% 
shooter, was deteriorating after shooting a career-low 42.8% last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But try telling that to the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Drexler, who scored 26 points in the Trail Blazers' 121-100 victory Friday 
night, had 41 points, including 24 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Drexler made 16 of 21 shots, including all four of his three-pointers. He also 
had seven rebounds, six assists and five steals. Guard Rod Strickland had 23 
points and 14 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Drexler and Strickland combined to outscore the entire Clipper team, 24-19, in 
the third quarter as the Trail Blazers built a 26-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Drexler beat the buzzer with a 40-foot shot as Portland took a 94-68 lead into 
the fourth quarter. Strickland had 13 points and Drexler added 11 in the third 
quarter as the Trail Blazers outscored the Clippers, 37-19, to take command. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed by eight points at halftime, were outscored, 23-6, 
in the first five minutes of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The game may not have been a total loss for the Clippers, however, because 
Fitch might have found a point guard in forward Malik Sealy, acquired from the 
Indiana Pacers along with point guard Pooh Richardson and the rights to 
Nebraska swingman Eric Piatkowski for disgruntled point guard Mark Jackson and 
the rights to Louisville guard Greg Minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealy, who played the entire fourth quarter at point guard, had eight points, 
three assists, two rebounds and one steal in 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Tony Massenberg had 16 points and 13 rebounds, including 10 in the 
first half, as the Clippers outrebounded Portland, 44-40. Guard Terry Dehere 
had 16 points, but scored only four points in the final three quarters. Clipper 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The 39 fouls committed by the Clippers in Friday night's season-opening loss 
set a club single-game record, surpassing the old mark of 38, set in a 130-109 
loss to the Golden State Warriors on Nov. 6, 1990. . . . The Clippers open 
their home season Thursday night against the Atlanta Hawks at the Sports Arena. 
The Clippers, who have a seven-game series at The Pond, play the Phoenix Suns 
Saturday night in Anaheim.

BAD PASS, CBA JOURNEYMAN ONLY THING DOGGING THE LAKERS; PRO BASKETBALL: BUCKS' 
$68-MILLION ROOKIE NO. 1 DRAFT PICK GLENN ROBINSON MAKES DEBUT, BUT VAN EXEL'S 
TURNOVER COSTS LOS ANGELES IN 97-96 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The mega-buck Buck? Glenn Robinson, the Lakers could handle him. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Conlon, big-time only to moving companies, playing for the minimum, 
guaranteed $68 million less than the Big Dog? Big Trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, the No. 1 draft pick, finally made his debut Saturday night and 
collected eight points, four rebounds and five turnovers in 13 minutes in a 
reserve role. But Conlon made the play that mattered at the Bradley Center, 
stealing the ball from Nick Van Exel on an ill-advised pass and helping the 
Milwaukee Bucks steal a 97-96 victory over the Lakers before 18,633. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers had the ball, a one-point lead and an insurance-policy timeout with 
about 15 seconds left. They should have had Van Exel at the line, too, because 
the Bucks, playing catchup from what was a nine-point deficit late in the third 
quarter, were forced to foul to stop the clock and get the ball back. At least 
they should have been. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Van Exel picked up his dribble deep in the backcourt against a 
two-man trap, he was suddenly in trouble, not Milwaukee. He could have called a 
timeout to escape the jam, but said later it didn't occur to him. Searching for 
an open man, he threw the ball to Sedale Threatt, standing across midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 Conlon intercepted at the 10-second line and raced toward the basket, but was 
fouled by Threatt just before getting close enough for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
 At the line, with 11.8 seconds left, he swished both shots to put the Bucks 
ahead for the first time since halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were down by one," Conlon said. "I knew I had to do something, even if I 
fouled." 
</P>
<P>
 Not possible. Not Conlon, who opened last season with Rockford of the 
Continental Basketball Assn. before bouncing from the Charlotte Hornets to the 
Washington Bullets, who had also played with the Sacramento Kings and Seattle 
SuperSonics earlier in his career and who came to the Bucks for $150,000. He 
can do no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, in the season opener at Philadelphia, he scored 20 points, tying 
Johnny Newman for team-high honors, as the Bucks won, 91-86. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, in the home opener, when people came to see Robinson even though 
Coach Mike Dunleavy had said the rookie with the $68.15-million contract 
probably would not play, he got 11 of his 15 points in the second half in a 
one-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop, Las Vegas. Bring the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's surprising," Conlon said. "But it feels good." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to the Lakers. Even with a rookie point guard last season, they had the 
third-fewest turnovers in the league, and then they opened Friday by committing 
only 14 in the victory at Detroit. Then came another 20-victory team from last 
season, a team with one starting guard injured and one future starting forward 
with all of one game-day shoot-around of NBA experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Come late in the fourth quarter, the Lakers held a 94-90 lead before the roof 
caved in. Three bad passes, two by Van Exel, in the final 2:10 became six Buck 
points. Counting an offensive foul by Threatt, four of their 16 turnovers came 
in those last 130 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 None, of course, was bigger than Van Exel's pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him," Van Exel said of Conlon. "But we're in the NBA. You're supposed 
to come to the ball. That's common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Threatt, the intended target who didn't: "Everybody should have come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, nobody did. Van Exel was stuck, made a bad decision by not calling 
the timeout that would have bailed him out and then a bad pass. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes the Lakers 1-1 with a visit to Madison Square Garden up next. 
</P>
<P>
 "The turnovers were costly to us," said Coach Del Harris, who spent eight 
seasons with the Bucks as a scout, assistant and head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping that after only 14 (Friday) night that we had turned the corner 
on turnovers, which had been a problem during the eight preseason games. But we 
self-destructed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hurt ourselves with the turnovers, no question about it. Milwaukee stayed 
in the game and battled. All in all, it was a lesson in effort. As far as the 
effort of Marty Conlon." Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 When Anthony Peeler was held out of Friday's game at Detroit, it was the first 
time in two-plus seasons as a pro that he has not played on a coach's decision. 
The starting shooting guard from a year ago didn't get in Saturday, either. . . 
. Cedric Ceballos led the Lakers with 20 points. Vin Baker had 22 points and 12 
rebounds, both game highs, for the Bucks. . . . If fans had a problem with 
Glenn Robinson's lengthy holdout and original demand of $100 million, it didn't 
show. The former Purdue All-American was cheered wildly during pregame 
introductions and then every time he so much as made a layup.

 YOU PUT YOUR DUKES UP AGAINST ANYBODY NOW 
</P>
<P>
 Duke in postseason play? Happens every year. Oh, you mean football. 
</P>
<P>
 After enduring trashings and thrashings at the hands of Virginia for the last 
five years, Spence Fischer and No. 23 Duke finally ended the futility with a 
28-25 victory over the 13th-ranked Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it all mean? Duke Coach Fred Goldsmith thinks he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to a bowl, there's no doubt about that," Goldsmith said. "I know 
the bowls that are still out there for Duke University right now and they're 
all very good. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when you've been at Rice for five years, baby, they're all major now." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer ran for two touchdowns and passed for one as the Blue Devils (8-1) had 
to rally Duke from a first-half deficit after it began to look like another 
beating. In the previous five games, Virginia (6-2) outscored the Blue Devils, 
232-59. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils and Cavaliers have been bitter rivals since sharing the 
Atlantic Coast Conference championship in 1989. Then-Duke coach Steve Spurrier 
made disparaging comments about Virginia's failure that season to beat 
defending league champion Clemson while the Blue Devils upset the Tigers, 
backing Spurrier's argument that Duke should have had the title to itself. 
FOOTBALL: A STRANGE GAME 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Ballard, the interim head football coach at Morehead State for more than 
a year, was hired full-time Saturday despite his team's 0-9 record. SUDDEN 
HEROES 
</P>
<P>
 -- Warrick Franklin made a game-saving tackle as Rice held off Southern 
Methodist, 17-10. On fourth down at the Rice 9 with four seconds left, SMU's 
Jacques Smith caught a pass but was stopped at the 2 by Franklin as time ran 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- North Texas' Jeff Graham kicked a 32-yard field goal with two seconds left 
to lift the Eagles to a 33-33 tie with Stephen F. Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steve Videtich, who earlier missed a conversion, kicked a 35-yard field 
goal with six seconds left to give North Carolina State a 47-45 victory over 
Maryland. BEARCATS BEAR DOWN (IT BEARS WATCHING) 
</P>
<P>
 Take heart, oh Cincinnati, you Queen City, you mighty metropolis on the Ohio 
River. You actually have a team in town that can win a football game. Here's 
the kind of score you've been looking for so long. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 University of Cincinnati 28, Troy State 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Jermaine Sturkie ran five yards for the go-ahead touchdown and Robert Garnet 
preserved the Bearcats' lead with an interception with 40 seconds to play as 
Cincinnati won its first game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 What it all means is simple: The Bengals need to schedule Troy State. BEVO 
FEELS BAD TOO 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere, Darrell Royal and Earl Campbell and all the guys who had burnt 
orange steer heads painted on their white helmets are frowning. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M's 34-10 victory over Texas at Memorial Stadium in Austin was the 
Aggies' fourth in a row over the Longhorns. It was A&M's 10th victory over 
Texas in the last 11 meetings of their 101-game rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken fried steaks will be flown at half-staff in Austin this week. MAYBE HE 
SHOULD TRY THREATENING TO STAY 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa State got bounced by Kansas State, 38-20, in Iowa State's first game 
since Coach Jim Walden announced he was quitting at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden, who announced on Thursday that he would step down, dropped to 28-55-3 
in eight years at Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
 At least he is not going quietly. In the first half, furious that Kansas State 
did not get called for roughing the passer, Walden rushed onto the field to 
argue with officials and drew a 15-yard penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't won a game, and as far as I'm concerned I haven't seen one 
officiating crew my team wasn't better than," said Walden, noting that 
lame-duck coaches cannot be disciplined for badmouthing officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was the most hideous thing I've ever seen. To let a player slam-dunk 
one of my players -- that would be a violation in the wrestling rink." YOU PUT 
YOUR RIGHT FOOT IN, YOU PUT . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How do you play defense? It's a secret in West Lafayette, Ind. Don't ask 
Purdue Coach Jim Colletto, who thinks he knows what is wrong with the 
Boilermakers after watching Michigan gain 498 yards in a 21-point Wolverine 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Colletto: "We can't get lined up right, we can't tackle. On defense we 
are not good at all." THE VIEW ISN'T GREAT OVER AT PRAIRIE VIEW 
</P>
<P>
 Before Prairie View A&M played Tarleton State, Prairie View Coach Ron Beard 
said the Panthers were favored to win, despite the fact that his team had lost 
43 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for Beard's career as an oddsmaker. Prairie View lost to Tarleton, 
70-20, to tie the NCAA Division I-AA record of 44 consecutive defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 Prairie View, which has been outscored, 408-87, this season, can break its 
losing streak tie with Columbia by losing to Jackson State next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may be losers on the football field," Beard said, "but they're winners 
in every other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Alfonse Provo wants a degree to make his mother proud. Cory Fregia 
and Kevin Garner wanted a chance to play football, even if it meant not getting 
a scholarship. The school offers no football scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Since beating Mississippi Valley State, 21-12, on Oct. 28, 1989, the Panthers 
have been outscored 1,889-267. They've lost by 92-0 (Alabama State, 1991), 66-0 
(Grambling this year), 63-0 (Alcorn State, 1992) and 61-0 (Southwest Missouri 
State, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Kevin Garner says fan support is lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half of them are with us," he said, "and the other half come to the games so 
they can hassle us on Monday." THIS BROOK ROLLS ALONG AND SO DOES NEBRASKA 
</P>
<P>
 Tommie who? 
</P>
<P>
 Brook Berringer, Tommie Frazier's replacement as Nebraska's quarterback, 
completed 13 of 18 passes for 267 yards in a 45-17 wipeout of Kansas in 
Lincoln. It was the most passing yards for a Cornhusker since Vince Ferragamo 
had 264 against Miami in 1976. YOU GRADING DOWN LIONS OR MERELY NITTANY 
PICKING? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, last week Penn State won by 59 points and fell from No. 1 to No. 2 
in the AP poll. On Saturday, Penn State won by six points over Indiana, so how 
much is the Nittany Lions' latest victory going to cost them? 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State Coach Joe Paterno says it matters not one whit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't care about the polls," he said. "All I care about is taking one game 
at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, that's all they let you take, Joe, no matter what your team is ranked. 
HE'S GLAD THESE COWBOYS CAN'T PLAY 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado didn't exactly dominate Oklahoma State at Boulder, Colo, but the 
Buffaloes won anyway, 17-3. Rashaan Salaam said he was thankful Colorado was 
only playing Oklahoma State. Instead of? 
</P>
<P>
 Said Salaam: "Somebody else tough. It could've been a different outcome." GET 
PAUL SIMON: 50 WAYS TO LEAVE A LOSER 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi fans, it wasn't bad enough that Memphis scored on a two-yard 
touchdown pass with four seconds left to beat your team, 17-16. 
</P>
<P>
 You've got Memphis winning for the first time in Oxford, Miss., since the 
series began 73 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 You've got Memphis quarterback Joe Borich, successful on only seven of 24 
passes for 55 yards before throwing the winning touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 You've got a taunting penalty setting up the winning touchdown after Memphis 
was halted for the 11th time on third down. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, there's more. Mississippi blew its lead in a ghastly way. Quarterback 
Josh Nelson, who was 10 of 21 for 166 yards, attempted three passes in the 
second half. Two were intercepted, the other was incomplete. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 -- Auburn's 38-21 victory over East Carolina was it's 20th in a row, the 
nation's longest winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brian Pruitt rushed for five touchdowns and a school-record 356 yards and 
also set a Mid-American Conference record with 435 all-purpose yards as Central 
Michigan defeated Toledo, 45-27. Pruitt has 1,749 yards rushing this season, 
breaking the MAC single-season record of 1,668 yards set by Western Michigan's 
Shawn Faulkner in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grambling State Coach Eddie Robinson edged closer to his 400th win as the 
9-0 Tigers preserved their perfect season with a 51-24 victory over Alabama 
State at Grambling, La. Robinson has 397 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 54,463 who watched Oklahoma's 30-13 victory over Missouri was the 
Sooners' smallest home crowd since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michigan's Tyrone Wheatley moved into second place on the school's career 
rushing list with 148 yards in a 45-23 victory over Purdue. Wheatley passed 
Butch Woolfolk in bringing his career total to 3,916. Jamie Morris set the 
school record of 4,393 yards between 1984 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coe College running back Carey Bender broke the NCAA career scoring record 
when he had four touchdowns in a 42-35 victory over Cornell, Iowa. Bender has 
480 points from 78 touchdowns and six two-point conversions. The previous 
record was 474 points, set from 1982-85 by Joe Dudek of Plymouth (N.H.) State, 
like Coe, a Division III school.

 In a game much tougher than anyone expected, No. 25 Brigham Young turned to 
big plays to overcome Division I-A newcomer Northeast Louisiana, 24-10, 
Saturday at Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Mitchell provided one of them -- a fourth quarter end-zone 
interception that stopped the Indians, who were trailing, 17-10, at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 John Walsh passed for 256 yards and three touchdowns -- two to Hema Heimuli -- 
to lead BYU (8-2). Jamal Willis rushed for 134 yards in 26 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 NLU (1-8), an independent playing its first season out of Division I-AA, 
stayed close through most of the game. The Indians led, 7-3, after the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Through three quarters the teams were fairly even statistically. BYU had 332 
yards total offense. Northeast Louisiana had 313. In the fourth quarter, 
however, BYU took over, gaining 133 yards to Northeast's 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada 62, Fresno State 35 -- Nevada of the Big West embarrased the Bulldogs 
of the WAC at Fresno, as Mike Maxwell completed 33 of 46 passes for 443 yards 
and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada ran up 683 yards of total offense and never punted. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Van Dyke had 15 catches for 173 yards and three touchdowns for the Wolf 
Pack (8-1), and tailback Ken Minor rushed for 155 yards in 26 carries. Minor 
started in place of Marcellus Chrishon, out with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 For Fresno State (4-6), it was the most lopsided defeat at home since 1981 and 
marked the first time in 11 years the Bulldogs have lost two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada forced five turnovers in the game, four of those on interceptions of 
Richie Donati. Nevada had only two interceptions in its previous eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 14 Colorado State 35, Wyoming 24 -- The Rams, trailing 21-7, rallied for a 
WAC victory at Fort Collins, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 catch in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State (8-1, 6-1) went ahead, 28-24, on a 28-yard pass from Anthoney 
Hill to Eric Olsen, who made an over-the-shoulder catch in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming dropped to 4-6, 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force 10, Army 6 -- Preston McConnell scored on a 10-yard run and Randy 
Roberts kicked a 26-yard field goal as the Falcons continued their dominance 
over Army with a victory at West Point. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Air Force's sixth consecutive victory over Army (3-6) and secured the 
Commander in Chief's Trophy for the Falcons (6-3) for a record sixth 
consecutive time.

NEW MEXICO STUNS NO. 9 UTAH; WAC: BIG FOURTH-DOWN PLAY LEADS TO GAME- WINNING 
FIELD GOAL FOR LOBOS IN 23-21 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was fourth down and a New Mexico team that had consistently come up short 
this season faced one of the best defensive units in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dennis Franchione didn't blink and quarterback Stoney Case never threw a 
bigger pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Case bailed New Mexico out of a fourth-and-three from its own 27 with a 
56-yard pass to Gavin Pearlman with 3:10 left to set up Nathan Vail's 
game-winning 22-yard field goal Saturday as the Lobos stunned No. 9 and 
previously undefeated Utah, 23-21, in a Western Athletic Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some doubt in my mind whether we'd go for it," Case said. "I 
started walking toward the sideline and coach waved me back out. I put up four 
fingers to make sure he knew it was fourth down and he shook his head yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Case found the 5-foot-8 Pearlman momentarily open at the Lobos' 35. Pearlman 
slipped a tackle by Utah's Keith Harrison and sprinted to the Utes' 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "In practice drills, we always practice on getting as much as we can," said 
Pearlman, who had five catches for a career-high 123 yards against a Utah 
defense ranked 10th overall and third against the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlman got enough to set up Vail's game-winner and give a New Mexico team 
that has lost five games by a touchdown or less this season the biggest victory 
in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico, 4-6 overall and 3-3 in the WAC, ended the Utes' unblemished season 
with a combination of Case's quarterbacking and a young defense that held the 
potent Utes' offense scoreless in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah (8-1, 5-1) came into the game with the nation's sixth best offense, 
averaging 40.3 points a game. New Mexico's defense, with five freshmen 
starters, was ranked 105th and giving up 34 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah Coach Ron McBride chalked up the loss to New Mexico's ability to control 
the ball and the clock, poor tackling and other mistakes that eventually caught 
up with the Utes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the little things that happen in a game are the things we didn't do well 
today," McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico dominated the second half, holding the Utes to 31 yards in the 
third quarter, after giving up 305 in the first half when Utah built a 21-11 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our third quarter was horrendous," said McBride.

DEFENSE RISES TO OCCASION; TROJANS: WASHINGTON STATE'S VAUNTED DEFENDERS TAKE A 
BACK SEAT AS USC MAKES THE BIG PLAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC's defense didn't quite know how to express itself this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans were up against the nation's No. 2 defense, Washington State's 
vaunted "Palouse Posse." USC needed a rallying cry but, frankly, didn't have 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honest, We Really Don't Stink," wasn't going to cut it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't come out and say, 'What about SC?' " linebacker Jeff Kopp said. 
"What are you going to say? That we've got a good defense? We were the only 
ones who knew that." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the rest of the Pacific 10 Conference knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense, as expected, ruled the day in USC's 23-10 victory over Washington 
State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise. It was the Trojan defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The same defense that entered play ranked eighth overall in a 10-team 
conference; ninth against the run, fifth against the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "On paper, we don't look like a very good defense," Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most didn't give the Trojan defenders a snowball's chance in Pullman. But, 
suddenly, the unit was struck with inspiration when the team got pelted in 
pregame warm-ups by the slush-throwing goofballs in Martin Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each snowball got us more fired up," defensive lineman Matt Keneley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans held the Cougars to 10 points and 283 total yards. USC, meanwhile, 
racked up 395 yards against what was hailed to be the best defense this side of 
Memphis (the University of, the nation's top-ranked unit). 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars led the nation in two important categories, allowing opponents an 
average of only 10.4 points and 58 rushing yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans allowed the Cougars 10 points and 50 net rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told our defense all week, we're going to have to hold them to 14 points to 
win the game," USC defensive coordinator Don Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's defense appears to have finally recovered from the shell-shock suffered 
in a Sept. 9 defeat to Penn State in which the Trojans, on national television, 
surrendered 534 total yards in a 38-14 loss that wasn't as close as the score 
indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people saw us against Penn State and said, 'This is a bad team,' " 
USC Coach John Robinson said. "But we're a pretty good team." 
</P>
<P>
 USC doesn't have a star to lean on, no Willie McGinest to call its own 
anymore. The Trojans are starting a sophomore and a freshman on the defensive 
front and can't use the gambling, swarm tactics Washington State employs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to play half-court," Lindsey said, using a basketball analogy. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the more tactical approach, the Trojans need 11 able men to rally around 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, USC was led by Kopp, the senior linebacker, who finished with eight 
tackles and two sacks. Kopp was exploited on Washington State's only score, a 
33-yard scoring pass to tight end Eric Moore, but it did not stop the 
linebacker from dominating the game's latter moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp ended any Cougar comeback thoughts late in the game when he sacked 
quarterback Chad Davis for a six-yard loss on second down and snuffed out the 
drive with another tackle on Davis on fourth and 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a big-play guy," Kopp said afterward. "We've got to have a lot 
of guys contributing." 
</P>
<P>
 Other contributors: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brian Williams. The senior linebacker set the tone for the second half when 
he tackled tailback Derek Sparks for a four-yard loss on third and one to stop 
the Cougars' opening drive. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Donn Cunnigan. The senior linebacker made the game's first key play when he 
intercepted backup quarterback Derek Chapman's pass and returned it eight yards 
to the Cougar 30, setting up the Trojans' first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunnigan also delivered the game's keynote address in the second quarter when 
he leveled and dislodged the ball from receiver Kearney Adams, who was crossing 
the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brian Kelly. The freshman cornerback intercepted a Davis pass with 1:45 
left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojan defense is back on track and streaking toward a possible rematch 
with Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute after that game, we realized -- no, we knew -- there was a 100% 
chance they'd be in the Rose Bowl," Keneley said of the Nittany Lions. "We knew 
if we could continue to build, and improve, we'd have another chance to show 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would be nothing better than to face the No. 1 team in the nation, and 
beat them, after what they did to us. That's been an underlying goal for us."

TRICK PLAY ELEMENTARY FOR SCURLOCK; PAC-10: ARIZONA CORNERBACK INTERCEPTS 
HALFBACK OPTION PASS AND RETURNS IT 97 YARDS FOR TOUCHDOWN IN 13-6 VICTORY OVER 
CALIFORNIA.

 Mike Scurlock returned an interception 97 yards in the first quarter and Jim 
Hoffman made consecutive sacks to close off a late threat as No. 18 Arizona 
defeated old nemesis California, 13-6, Saturday night to stay in the race for 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, 7-2 overall and 5-1 in the Pacific 10, remained tied with Oregon and 
USC for the lead.California (3-6, 2-4) had won five of the last six games in 
the series, and was threatening to pull out this decision until the final 1:51. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats held California at bay, but Pat Barnes' 26-yard pass to Sean 
Bullard on third-and-10 moved Cal to the Arizona 46 with 3:21 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Barnes, Cal's third-string quarterback who played the entire 
game, scrambled for nine yards, and a pass interference call against Arizona 
gave Cal a first down at the Wildcat 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes threw an incomplete pass and Reynard Rutherford lost five yards. Then 
Hoffman sacked Barnes on third and fourth down and Cal turned the ball over on 
downs. 
</P>
<P>
 The second sack came with 1:45 remaining, and Arizona ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McLaughlin kicked field goals of 54 yards, longest of his career, and 42 
yards at the end of Arizona's first two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes' 50-yard pass to Na'il Benjamin carried to the Arizona 20, and three 
plays later Barnes scrambled 11 yards to the Wildcat two. 
</P>
<P>
 On third-and-goal, Barnes pitched to Tyrone Edwards, who looped a halfback 
pass back toward Barnes in the left end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scurlock, a cornerback, picked off the pass at the three and returned it 
97 yards down the right sideline, scoring with 20 seconds left in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 A television tape showed Scurlock stepped out at the Cal 12 but officials 
didn't see it.

 Cameron Reynolds, Oregon State's offensive star, credits the Beavers' defense 
for his team's 24-12 victory over Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played incredible," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers got within Oregon State's 20-yard line six times but had to settle 
for one touchdown and two field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds caught a 57-yard touchdown pass from Don Shanklin and scored again on 
a 74-yard run in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State (3-6) overcame three fumbles and 10 penalties for a loss of 80 
yards to end a two-game losing streak.

OREGON WINS, CLOSES IN ON ROSE BOWL; PACIFIC 10: AFTER DEFEATING ARIZONA STATE, 
34-10, DUCKS ARE ONLY TWO VICTORIES AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chant "Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl!" began in the third quarter. It was 
noticeably tentative, as if Oregon fans couldn't quite believe what they were 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Danny O'Neil threw for three third-quarter touchdowns Saturday in 
No. 21 Oregon's 34-10 romp over Arizona State, and Washington State lost to 
USC, the Ducks are in control of the race to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon, 7-3 overall and 5-1 in the Pacific 10, can advance to the Rose Bowl 
for the first time in 37 years if it wins its last two games, at Stanford and 
at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two more weeks, lay everything you've got on the line, and we're probably 
going to go to the Rose Bowl," O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he doesn't want his teammates to think too much about that ultimate goal. 
"Hopefully this team is going to have the same mindset we did when we were 
1-2," he said. "Let's forget about the media. Let's forget about the fans. 
Let's just take care of business. We know what we've got to do. Hopefully, if 
we do that, we'll have a lot of time to celebrate in that month we have off 
after the Oregon State game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have defeated USC and Arizona, the only other Pac-10 teams with one 
conference loss, and continued to gain momentum with a convincing victory over 
an Arizona State team they were favored to beat by only a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is that after getting a little notoriety last week, we didn't 
go in the tank," Oregon Coach Rich Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon's "Gang Green" defense had gotten most of the attention lately, but the 
offense rolled for 515 yards against the Sun Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been an offense that has been a little conservative prior to today," 
Brooks said. "But we felt we could open it up a little more today and it bore 
fruit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' Ricky Whittle rushed for 140 yards in 15 carries, including a 
67-yard touchdown run in the first quarter that ended with a pirouette dive 
into the end zone as he held the ball over his head, a showboat move that drew 
a penalty and the ire of Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He rode me pretty hard because that's not the character of our team," Whittle 
said. "It was a one-time kind of thing that will never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State (3-6, 2-4) trailed only 13-3 at halftime. But the Sun Devils 
lost starting cornerbacks Marcus Soward and Craig Newsome to injuries in the 
first half and O'Neil and his recently returned favorite receiver, Cristin 
McLemore, turned the game into a runaway. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil, who is No. 2 on Oregon's career passing list but had not had a big 
game statistically all season, was five of eight for 175 yards in the third 
quarter as the Ducks took a 34-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 His last three completions went for touchdowns. The first was a 14-yarder to 
McLemore, the second a 67-yard bomb to Pat Johnson, who caught the ball over 
his shoulder and raced for the score. And the third was a 66-yarder to 
McLemore, who returned last week after missing two games with a sprained right 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil completed 13 of 26 passes for a season-high 234 yards and didn't play 
in the last quarter. He was not intercepted. McLemore caught seven passes for 
121 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State's Jake Plummer completed 20 of 34 passes for 216 yards, 
including one for 12 yards to Clyde McCoy in the fourth quarter for the Sun 
Devils' only touchdown. Arizona State managed just 87 yards on the ground, 42 
of them on one play. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ensured Sun Devil Coach Bruce Snyder his first losing season in three 
years at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's bitter for me and bitter for this football team," Snyder said. "We're 
really hurt by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon hasn't been 5-1 in the conference since 1957, which is also the last 
time the Ducks went to the Rose Bowl. The Ducks have won six of their last 
seven and have consecutive victories over California, Washington, Arizona and 
Arizona State, all at home, where Oregon finished with a 6-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're probably better than I thought they would be," Arizona State wide 
receiver Keith Poole said.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; BUCKEYES REBOUND TO DEFEAT WISCONSIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marlon Kerner intercepted two passes and Ohio State's defense, pounded for 63 
points at Penn State a week ago, dominated throughout as the Buckeyes defeated 
Wisconsin, 24-3, Saturday at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State scored the most points against a Buckeye team since 1902. Along the 
way, the Nittany Lions piled up 303 yards rushing and 572 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wisconsin was limited to 203 yards, including only 49 on the ground. 
Wisconsin's tailback tandem of Brent Moss and Terrell Fletcher, averaging 237 
yards a game coming in, was held to 77 yards in 20 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a rematch of last year's co-champions of the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin fell to 4-4-1 overall and 3-3-1 in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory left Ohio State (7-3, 4-2) tied for second in the Big Ten, two 
games back of Penn State with games remaining at Indiana and against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin was coming off an impressive 31-19 victory over Michigan but was 
held without a touchdown for the first time in 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
 After holding the Badgers to only 51 yards in the first half while building a 
10-3 lead, Ohio State broke the game open as its defense picked off Darrell 
Bevell passes on all three Wisconsin possessions of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State 35, Northwestern 17 -- Duane Goulbourne ran for 181 yards and 
two touchdowns in 36 carries and Scott Greene gained 142 yards in 13 carries 
and scored twice to lead the Spartans to a Big Ten victory at Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave a lift to embattled Michigan State Coach George Perles, who 
reportedly will soon be asked to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to play hard regardless. We're still trying to win for coach but 
we're trying to win for ourselves, too," Goulbourne said. "We have to finish up 
with a good season." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Perles: "They played with great emotion. And somehow, some way I think 
they played a little harder for their coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State (4-5, 3-3) led, 21-14, at halftime after jumping to a 13-0 
lead. Northwestern (3-5-1, 2-4), which finished winless at home, rallied with 
late second-quarter touchdowns, one after a bad snap on a punt by Michigan 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats then pulled to within 21-17 on Sam Valenzisi's 51-yard field goal 
with 6:48 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time the Wildcats got the ball, punter Paul Burton, noticing there 
were only 10 Michigan State players on the field, ran with the ball on a fake 
but was stopped short of a first down. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State then moved 50 yards in seven plays with Goulbourne scoring on a 
third-down run of 16 yards with 1:06 left in the quarter. That made it 28-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois 21, Minnesota 17 -- Ty Douthard hurdled two yards into the end zone 
with 1:10 to play for his second touchdown of the game, capping a 15-point 
fourth quarter comeback that gave the Illini (6-3, 4-2) a Big Ten victory at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Douthard lost the ball after crossing the goal line and it was recovered by 
the Gophers -- for naught as it turned out, since officials ruled it a 
touchdown anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Douthard's run ended a 10-play, 71-yard drive highlighted by a 17-yard pass 
from Johnny Johnson to Ken Dilger on third-and-14 from the 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Illini still had their work cut out for them after Rishon Early returned 
the ensuing kickoff 75 yards to the Illinois 25. But Kevin Hardy forced Chris 
Darkins' fumble at the five and Dana Howard recovered.  
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota (3-6, 1-5) led, 17-6, going into the fourth quarter.

SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP; TEXAS A&M BOWLS OVER TEXAS, 34-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 11th-ranked Texas A&M Aggies aren't eligible for a bowl game due to NCAA 
sanctions, so they played Texas like it was the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 A matchup that figured in preseason to be one of the best in the Southwest 
Conference was over before halftime as A&M routed the Longhorns, 34-10, 
Saturday at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Thomas scored twice, Leeland McElroy ran for a touchdown and set up 
another with an 83-yard kickoff return, and that was the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Mitchell returned a fumble 48 yards for a score after a sack by 
Antonio Armstrong separated Texas quarterback James Brown from the ball in the 
second quarter. And A&M's Dennis Allen blocked a punt in the third quarter, 
although it didn't lead to any points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had to beat them to the punch and that's why we won the game," 
Thomas said. "Games like this are won on big plays, and we just had more than 
they did." 
</P>
<P>
 A&M, 8-0-1 overall and 5-0-1 in the SWC, which has Louisville and Texas 
Christian left on its schedule, rebounded from a shocking 21-21 tie with 
Southern Methodist last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas (5-4, 2-3) must win one more game against Houston or Baylor to qualify 
for its first bowl game in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Longhorns, whose season opened with Cotton Bowl hopes and degenerated into 
a nightmare of injuries and player suspensions, played before 82,312 fans, the 
fourth largest home crowd in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies won their fourth consecutive against the Longhorns and their 10th 
in the last 11 meetings of the heated 101-game rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M scored on its first two drives -- on a 15-yard pass from Corey 
Pullig to Thomas and a three-yard run by McElroy -- while Texas never got past 
the Aggies 38 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 A&M put the game away with 9:30 left in the second quarter when Mitchell 
lumbered down the sideline with his fumble recovery, giving the Aggies a 21-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas didn't score until Darrell Wilson churned into the end zone on a 1-yard 
run with 9:57 left in the third quarter. Phil Dawson added a 47-yard field goal 
with 2:08 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice 17, Southern Methodist 10 -- Rice built an early 17-point lead on short 
touchdown runs by Emerson Allen and Spencer George, and Warrick Franklin made a 
game-saving tackle as the Owls held off Southern Methodist, keeping alive hopes 
of representing the Southwest Conference in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth down at the Rice nine with four seconds left, SMU's Jacques Smith 
hauled down a pass from Ramon Flanigan but was stopped at the two by Franklin 
as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 The game at Houston featured 10 fumbles, six by Rice (4-4, 3-2) and each team 
had three turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 SMU is 1-8-1 and 0-5-1.

WHEATLEY RUNS FOR 148 YARDS, HELPS MICHIGAN WIN, 45-23

<P>
 Tyrone Wheatley moved into second place on Michigan's career rushing list with 
148 yards, leading a ground game that accumulated 307 yards as No. 20 Michigan 
defeated Purdue, 45-23, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley scored on runs of seven and one yard as Michigan gained 498 yards in 
its highest-scoring game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't play defense in this league, you can't win and we're not 
stopping anyone," said Purdue Coach Jim Colletto, whose team has yielded nearly 
483 yards per game this season. "We can't get lined up right, we can't tackle. 
On defense we are not good at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley gained 34 yards on his first rush and went on to pass Butch Woolfolk 
in bringing his career total to 3,916 with the 20th 100-yard game of his 
career. Jamie Morris set the school record of 4,393 yards between 1984 and 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of set the tempo for everybody," Wheatley said of his first run. 
"Everything just clicked for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan, 6-3 overall and 4-2 in the Big Ten, put together two 72-yard 
touchdown drives to take a 14-7 lead after one quarter and went on to its 
eighth consecutive victory over the Boilermakers (4-3-2, 2-2-2). 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines consistently threw underneath the Purdue defense with Todd 
Collins completing 15 of 18 for 191 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything seemed to be working well," said Collins, who completed passes to 
eight receivers. "We got off on the right foot from the beginning and it just 
kept on going."

 The No. 7 Colorado Buffaloes, knocked out of their No. 2 ranking last week in 
a loss to Nebraska, were flat again Saturday, but managed to defeat Oklahoma 
State, 17-3, at Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're emotionally spent," Coach Bill McCartney said. "The season has been a 
demanding, hard-working season, and we haven't had the luxury of taking any 
break in the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't at our best last week, and we weren't at our best today." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado, 8-1 overall and 4-1 in the Big Eight, was barely good enough to beat 
the Cowboys (3-5-1, 0-4-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Kordell Stewart scored one touchdown and passed for another and Rashaan Salaam 
rushed for 174 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State led, 3-0, early in the first quarter on a 24-yard field goal by 
Lawson Vaughn, but a few minutes later, when Stewart stepped back to pass, he 
noticed the entire right side of the field was vacant, tucked the ball away and 
ran 27 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The touchdown was set up by Steve Rosga's interception of Tone' Jones' pass on 
the Colorado 45. Rosga returned it to the Oklahoma State 30 and three plays 
later Stewart scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart ended a 96-yard drive in the second quarter with a one-yard touchdown 
pass to Phil Savoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam, who was leading the nation in rushing (173.7 yards per game), was held 
in check by the Cowboys in the first half with 65 yards. Among his 109 yards in 
the second half was a 49-yard run in the third quarter to the Oklahoma State 18 
that led to a 29-yard field goal by Neil Voskeritchian. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 15 Kansas State 38, Iowa State 20 -- Chad May's four touchdown passes in 
this Big Eight game at Manhattan, Kan., gave him the Kansas State career record 
and the Wildcats rolled to the victory in Iowa State's first game since Coach 
Jim Walden announced he was quitting at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 May's 30 touchdown passes in less than two full seasons surpassed the record 
of 29 set in 1968-70 by Lynn Dickey. His four scoring passes tied the 
single-game mark. Two went to Tyson Schwieger, who leads the Big Eight with 
seven touchdown catches. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 15-4-1 as Kansas State's starter, May has also rushed for eight 
touchdowns. The victory keeps Kansas State (6-2, 3-2) in position for a top 
bowl bid. Iowa State (0-8-1, 0-4-1) must now beat Colorado or Nebraska to avoid 
its first winless season since 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 May completed 26 of 36 passes for 312 yards before going to the bench with 
11:47 to play and Kansas State leading, 38-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma 30, Missouri 13 -- Darrius Johnson returned a punt 87 yards for a 
fourth-quarter touchdown to break open the game at Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma (5-4, 3-2) didn't have great success on the ground against the 
league's second-worst rushing defense, gaining 181 yards on 3.9 yards per 
carry. Garrick McGee helped offset that by completing 15 of 22 passes for 165 
yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 For Missouri (3-6, 2-3), freshman Brock Olivo ran for a career-best 107 yards 
in 23 carries and his two-yard touchdown run two minutes into the fourth 
quarter made the score 24-13.

NO. 2 PENN STATE HOLDS OFF INDIANA; BIG TEN: NO. 2 QUARTERBACK DITTOE RALLIES 
HOOSIERS, BUT TOUCHDOWNS COME TOO LATE AND NITTANY LIONS WIN, 35-29. 
</P>

<P>
 Penn State, which lost its No. 1 ranking to Nebraska last week, gave up two 
touchdown passes to Indiana's No. 2 quarterback, Chris Dittoe, in the final two 
minutes, but still easily defeated Indiana, 35-29, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most points scored off Penn State, 8-0 overall and 5-0 in the Big 
Ten, and its narrowest winning margin this season. Indiana (5-4, 2-4) lost its 
third consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a lot of things. We have to really credit Indiana for the defensive 
scheme they came in with," said Penn State quarterback Kerry Collins, the 
nation's leader in pass efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I don't think we were as sharp as we were last week. Put those two things 
together and we weren't as sharp as we have been in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State was coming off a 63-14 victory over Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you go on the road in the Big Ten you're going to be in for a tough 
football game," Collins said. "But I think it was good, because against Ohio 
State we did pretty much what we wanted to. I think we may have let down a 
little bit. It's a good lesson for us. We were in a tough ball game and Indiana 
played really well, and we had to scratch and claw to pull it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins passed for 213 yards and two touchdowns and Ki-Jana Carter rushed for 
192 yards and ran 80 yards for a touchdown, as Penn State seemed to have the 
game in control after leading, 35-14, with six minutes to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Dittoe, who replaced starter John Paci in the second quarter, passed five 
yards to Eddie Baety for a touchdown with 1:49 left. 
</P>
<P>
 After a punt, Indiana went 80 yards and scored again on Dittoe's 40-yard pass 
to Dorian Wilkerson as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Dittoe, who had two earlier touchdown passes to Ajamu Stoner, then connected 
with Stoner on a two-point conversion pass to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dittoe, who was 21 of 35 for 279 yards, said, "The coaches gave us a great 
game plan. The big thing was don't worry about who's coming in, don't worry 
about the ranking."

BERRINGER LEADS NEBRASKA, 45-17; BIG EIGHT: QUARTERBACK PASSES FOR 267 YARDS IN 
VICTORY OVER KANSAS, MOST FOR A CORNHUSKER SINCE 1972. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brook Berringer has proven himself yet again as Nebraska's quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after directing Nebraska's 24-7 victory over powerful Colorado a week 
ago, Berringer's talents had been questioned. Colorado Coach Bill McCartney 
said Berringer, who stepped in when blood clots sidelined Tommie Frazier in 
late September, had to prove he could throw to wide receivers instead of only 
the tight ends. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the wideouts were busy. Berringer threw for two touchdowns and 
Lawrence Phillips ran for two as No. 1 Nebraska beat Kansas, 45-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm done proving myself so don't even ask," Berringer said. "Our game plan 
was formed around what Bill McCartney said last week. We had to get the ball to 
the split ends, the receivers to prove ourselves, so that's what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Berringer completed 13 of 18 passes for 267 yards, the most for a Nebraska 
quarterback since David Humm's 267 against Missouri in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska, 10-0 overall and 5-0 in the Big Eight, also got its 10th consecutive 
100-yard effort from Phillips. The sophomore from Baldwin Park, held to 35 
yards in 11 carries in the first half, finished with 153 in 21 tries with 
touchdown runs of four and 22 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kansas (5-4, 2-3) taking early aim at Phillips, Berringer went to the 
air, completing eight of 10 passes for 249 yards and two touchdowns by 
halftime. Reggie Baul hauled in a 51-yard scoring pass and another covered 64 
yards to Clester Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "They crowded the run so we thought we had to get them off our backs," Coach 
Tom Osborne said. "So we threw the ball deep more than usual today. They were 
supporting with the secondary very fast. As a result they were a little more 
vulnerable to the deep ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers also got touchdowns on fullback Cory Schlesinger's 40-yard run 
and an eight-yarder by his backup, Jeff Makovicka, as Nebraska took a 38-10 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips broke the Nebraska sophomore rushing record by pushing his total to 
1,489. The old mark of 1,342 was set by Bobby Reynolds in 1950.

AUBURN GOES TO THE AIR FOR 38-21 VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stop the pass and Auburn will run on you. Focus on the ground game and be 
prepared to get burned through the air by the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 After Stephen Davis rushed for a career-high 246 yards last week against 
Arkansas, East Carolina decided to stack the line and take away that facet of 
Auburn's game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the third-ranked Tigers proved once again Saturday that they are not 
one-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sanders, reaffirming his status as one of the nation's top receivers, 
caught six passes for 173 yards and two touchdowns as Auburn won its 20th game 
in a row, defeating the Pirates, 38-21. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw Stephen have a big day against Arkansas last week and stacked people 
at the line of scrimmage to stuff the run," said offensive tackle Willie 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn quarterback Patrick Nix was nearly flawless in a 15 for 23 performance, 
throwing for 261 yards with no interceptions. By contrast, Pirates 
signal-caller Marcus Crandell was picked off four times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers (9-0) assured the nation's longest winning streak would continue 
with an 18-point third quarter against the Pirates (5-4), who have suffered all 
of their losses to top-25 teams.

FLORIDA STATE EXTENDS PERFECT ACC RECORD

<P>
 Florida State proved it again Saturday: The Seminoles are far superior to 
other Atlantic Coast Conference teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth-ranked Seminoles improved their ACC record to 23-0 with a 41-10 
rout of Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Kanell connected with Melvin Pearsall on two scoring passes and Warrick 
Dunn scored on a 63-yard run. The Yellow Jackets, 1-7 overall and 0-6 in the 
ACC, were held to only five yards rushing. Florida State (7-1, 7-0) clinched at 
least a share of the conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is any question they're the class of our conference," 
Georgia Tech Coach Bill Lewis said.

ATLANTIC COAST ROUNDUP; DUKE RALLIES PAST VIRGINIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Spence Fischer ran for two touchdowns and passed for another as 
No. 23 Duke defeated No. 13 Virginia, 28-25, Saturday at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer had to rally Duke from a first-half deficit after it began to look 
like another beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the way things have gone against Virginia in the past, a lot of people 
would have doubted us," said Fischer, who was 18 for 33 for 234 yards. "But I 
believed in myself. I knew I could do the job, and I think if I didn't believe 
in myself, we'd be here losing." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer tossed a nine-yard scoring pass to freshman Matt DeOrio with 10:41 
left in the third period to cap a 90-yard drive, and Fischer added his second 
score with 2:01 left in the period for a 28-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia, 6-2 overall and 4-2 in the ACC, replaced starting quarterback Mike 
Groh with reserve Symmion Willis to spark the offense, and it took two plays to 
pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis, a starter at the beginning of the season, passed to Demetrius Allen, 
who faked defensive back Jamal Ellis at the Duke 27 and raced to the end zone 
to complete a 69-yard scoring play with 7:07 left. Willis added a two-point 
conversion to draw the Cavaliers to 28-25. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils (8-1, 5-1) couldn't kill the clock and Virginia took its next 
shot. But Willis' first-and-10 pass for Bobby Neely was intercepted by LeVance 
McQueen. On the Cavaliers' last possession, Willis threw three incompletions 
and his fourth pass was picked off by Ray Farmer as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson 28, No. 19 North Carolina 17 -- The Tiger defense bottled up the Tar 
Heels' powerful running game and Nelson Welch kicked five field goals to become 
Clemson's career scoring leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers (4-5, 3-4), playing for pride if not a bowl bid, held the Tar Heels 
to 11 yards rushing, 230 yards below their league-leading average. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson dropped North Carolina for losses 10 times and knocked quarterback 
Jason Stanicek out of the game late in the first half because of a sprained 
left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels (6-3, 3-3) had the ball for only about eight minutes in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina State 47, Maryland 45 -- Steve Videtich atoned for a crucial 
missed conversion by kicking a 35-yard field goal with 6 seconds left at 
College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos King scored three touchdowns for the Wolfpack (6-2, 4-1), which scored 
on every possession except one cut short by the end of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wolfpack offense could barely keep up with the defense, which hardly 
looked like the ninth-best in the nation statistically. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Milanovich threw five touchdown passes for the Terrapins (4-5, 2-5), 
including the go-ahead score with 2:19 left. He completed his first 18 passes 
and finished 32 of 37 for 332 yards.

SOUTHEASTERN ROUNDUP; RESERVES STAR AS FLORIDA WINS

<TEXT>
<P>
 It doesn't seem to matter who's throwing or catching the football for Florida. 
The fourth-ranked Gators keep rolling along. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Steve Spurrier sent a wake-up call to his offense on Saturday by 
benching four starters, including leading receiver Jack Jackson, and giving 
third-string quarterback Eric Kresser a chance to star in a 55-17 homecoming 
victory over Southern Mississippi at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, a junior who has 10 touchdowns this season, watched from the sideline 
in a baseball cap as freshman Reidel Anthony scored on an 87-yard pass play and 
caught three passes for 149 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Wuerffel made his second start since replacing one-time Heisman hopeful 
Terry Dean at quarterback, but Kresser stole the show before a crowd of 85,448 
at Florida Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore, whose arm strength makes him more of a threat than Wuerffel to 
throw deep, tossed the long scoring pass to Anthony on his first snap. He 
completed 14 of 21 passes for 309 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresser entered the game in the second quarter and also completed scoring 
passes of 40 yards to Chris Doering and six yards to Sorola Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida, taking a break from the Southeastern Conference, improved to 7-1. 
Southern Mississippi, losing to a ranked opponent for the fourth time this 
season, is 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 24 Mississippi State 17, Arkansas 7 -- Eric Moulds caught two touchdown 
passes and Kevin Bouie ran for 142 yards as the Bulldogs won a fourth 
consecutive game for the first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State, 7-2 overall and 4-2 in the SEC, has won six of its last 
seven games and is close to its third bowl bid in four seasons under Coach 
Jackie Sherrill. Arkansas (3-6, 2-5) will have its second consecutive losing 
season under Danny Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulds had seven catches for 120 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis 17, Mississippi 16 -- Joe Borich completed a two-yard touchdown pass 
to Ryan Roskelly with four seconds left for the Tigers' first victory at 
Oxford, Miss., in a rivalry dating back 73 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis (6-3) came into the game with the nation's top-ranked defense. But 
after giving up a season-high 287 yards, it was the offense that came up with 
two fourth quarter touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Borich had completed only seven of 24 passes for 55 yards before the winning 
touchdown, which was set up by a penalty. After Memphis failed for the 11th 
time to convert on third down, Mississippi (3-6) was penalized for taunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight plays later, Borich converted on fourth-and-15, connecting with Frank 
Fletcher on an 18-yard pass. 
</P>
<P>
 His next pass bounced off the chest of receiver Joel Peschke near the end 
zone. After a second failed pass and a rush, he connected with Roskelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt 24, Kentucky 6 -- Jermaine Johnson ran for two touchdowns and 
Ronnie Gordon added a third for the Commodores at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt (5-4, 2-4) also got a 23-yard field goal from Steve Yenner. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky (1-8, 0-7) avoided a shutout on a 21-yard touchdown pass from Jeff 
Speedy to Isaac Curtis III with 47 seconds remaining.

ALABAMA DEFENSE LEADS VICTORY OVER LSU

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alabama won its 700th game and Jay Barker became the school's career passing 
leader as the sixth-ranked Crimson Tide defeated Louisiana State, 35-17, 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama, 9-0 overall and 6-0 in the SEC, converted two blocked punts and a 
fumble recovery into 21 points and assured an unprecedented sixth consecutive 
losing season for LSU (2-6, 2-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama, playing its 100th season, is 700-237-44. Michigan leads major 
colleges with 745 victories and Notre Dame has 728. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker, who completed 6 of 11 passes for 130 yards and one touchdown, has 
passed for 5,006 yards, surpassing Scott Hunter's mark of 4,899. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Williams carried 11 times for 99 yards and two touchdowns to pace 
Alabama's ground game. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama led, 28-3, at the half despite a big game by the LSU defense which 
limited the Crimson Tide to 37 yards rushing, recovered two fumbles, had two 
interceptions -- one off Barker and one off Williams on a halfback pass -- and 
sacked Barker once. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tide's defense made it 7-0 on LSU's first possession of the game when 
Robert Toomer fumbled and Sam Shade returned it 30 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 With 7:50 left in the half, Tommy Johnson blocked Mark Walker's punt on the 
LSU 49. Roman Colburn grabbed the ball at the 33 and went into the end zone for 
a touchdown that made it 14-3.

NBA ROUNDUP; KIDD'S DEBUT IS A WINNING ONE AS MAVERICKS OVERWHELM NETS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Kidd was all the Dallas Mavericks expected and more in his NBA debut 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd came within one rebound of a triple double and Jim Jackson tied a career 
high with 37 points as the Mavericks celebrated Coach Dick Mota's return with a 
112-103 victory over the New Jersey Nets in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the first game in a long career," Kidd said. "To me, it was just 
an average performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, the rookie from California who signed for $54 million, had 11 assists 
from his point guard position, scored 10 points and grabbed nine rebounds. He 
had three steals and committed only three turnovers as the Mavericks 
overwhelmed the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Mashburn scored 30 points as Kidd's presence seemed to energize a Dallas 
team that won only six home games last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just exciting being out on the court with Jason," Jackson said. "You 
have to be on your guard for some of his passes. But you know he's going to 
find some way to get you the ball. It's great to have somebody on the court who 
is a true point guard." 
</P>
<P>
 Motta was equally impressed with the play of his rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have expected Jason to be uptight, but he was loose and free," Motta 
said. "Every time we got a rebound, we pushed the ball up the court." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets were led by Kenny Anderson, who had 30 points, and Derrick Coleman, 
who scored 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 108, Denver 104 -- Ricky Pierce hit a jump shot and Latrell 
Sprewell sank two free throws in the final 43 seconds to lift the Warriors over 
the Nuggets in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce broke a 102-102 tie with a shot just inside the three-point line. 
Robert Pack missed a layup, and Sprewell followed with two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Hardaway led the Warriors with 28 points. Pierce and Sprewell scored 25 
and 24 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Rogers had 22 for the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 100, Chicago 99 -- Rex Chapman, whose last-second 20-footer gave 
Washington an opening-night upset of Orlando, followed up by scoring seven of 
his 26 points in overtime and leading the Bullets over the Bulls in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets, off to their first 2-0 start in nine seasons, had been 0-15 
against the Bulls since last beating them Nov. 3, 1990. Tom Gugliotta scored 19 
points for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's Scottie Pippen scored 23 of his 29 points after halftime. But he 
missed the Bulls' final two shots -- a 15-footer with about 30 seconds left and 
a driving layup in the closing moments. After the latter, he argued that he had 
been fouled by Kevin Duckworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Kukoc scored a career-high 25 points for the Bulls but missed two free 
throws in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 114, Atlanta 109 -- Terry Mills put Detroit ahead, then got a key 
steal in the final seconds of overtime as the Pistons beat the Hawks in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mills' short jumper with 37 seconds left gave the Pistons a 110-109 
lead, the Hawks' Andrew Lang missed a 15-footer and, with 10 seconds remaining, 
Joe Dumars made two free throws to make it 112-109. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills picked off Mookie Blaylock's inbound pass near midcourt with only five 
seconds left to kill Atlanta's chances for a tie and drove for a layup for the 
final margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds, and Dumars scored 18, seven of 
them in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta got 30 points from Ken Norman. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 122, Philadelphia 107 -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 30 points and had 
nine rebounds as the Magic defeated the 76ers in Orlando for their first 
victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Anderson had 22 points and eight assists for the Magic; Anfernee Hardaway 
scored 19 points and had seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Weatherspoon led the 76ers with 27 points, and rookie Sharone Wright 
had 23 points and 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 112, Boston 103 -- Reggie Miller led six Pacers in double figures with 
24 points as Indiana defeated the Celtics in Indianapolis, making 11 of 11 free 
throws down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Byron Scott scored 19 points off the bench for the Pacers. Dee Brown led the 
Celtics with 28 points, and Dominique Wilkins finished with 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 115, Charlotte 107 -- Tyrone Hill scored 14 of his 20 points in the 
third period as the Cavaliers broke a five-game losing streak in season openers 
with the victory in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Cleveland won a season-opening game was on Nov. 4, 1988, in a 
133-93 victory in Charlotte, the Hornets' inaugural game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Price scored 27 points, many from long range, for the Cavaliers. Scott 
Burrell led Charlotte with 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 115, Minnesota 85 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored 23 points as the Rockets 
turned the home debut of Minnesota Coach Bill Blair into a disaster with the 
Timberwolves' worst-ever home loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon finished nine short of becoming Houston's all-time leading scorer, 
and Otis Thorpe had 18 points and 14 rebounds for the defending NBA champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Too tall and too fast for the hapless Timberwolves, the Rockets dominated 
inside. Houston led by as many as 38 in the fourth, and the 30-point final 
margin topped Minnesota's previous worst home loss, a 26-point defeat to New 
Jersey on Dec. 30, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 110, Utah 103 -- Detlef Schrempf scored 26 points and Gary Payton 24 
to lead SuperSonics over the Jazz in Seattle's season opener at Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 A sellout crowd of 16,324 watched the SuperSonics come back in the third 
quarter after trailing by as many as 11 points in the third quarter. Karl 
Malone and John Stockton each scored 27 for the Jazz.

 Remember last Tuesday's sports on TV log? 04,12,12,35,14 Sport Time Event 
Channel Baseball 10:30 a.m. Arizona Fall League, Prime Ticket Chandler at 
Scottsdale (tape) Boxing 9 p.m. Joe Hipp vs. Rodolfo Marin; USA Andrew Golota 
vs. Jesse Ferguson at Las Vegas (delayed) Volleyball 10 p.m. Women, FIVB World 
Championships ESPN at Sao Paulo, Brazil (tape) Soccer 10:30 p.m. English League 
competition (tape) Prime Ticket This is what we were reduced to? 
</P>
<P>
 Instructional league baseball? Anonymous boxers? Women's volleyball and 
English soccer? And not only that, all of it taped? 
</P>
<P>
 In this spirit -- desperation -- we welcome the NBA back, to fill in the vast 
and howling wasteland suddenly carved this fall between "Monday Night Football" 
and the college and pro games on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 We not only have actual, live, weeknight games again but box scores, 
rotisserie leagues, controversies, larger issues like the racism alleged by 
Glenn Robinson's agent in denying his client a $100-million contract, silly 
issues like Dennis Rodman's hair, heroic undertakings like the Spurs' attempt 
to rewire the insides of Rodman's head at this late date, even stories with 
political implications like Charles Barkley's insistence that he will run for 
governor of Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 You might have noticed, this league isn't exactly like the others. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA players still run their mouths, speak their minds, play their roles and, 
not uncommonly, make fools of themselves. In short, they act like big kids 
excited at the privilege of being paid millions to play a game they love. They 
might not talk as often or say as much as they used to before prosperity set 
in, but it's still the wackiest ship on the sea of American sport. It's 
fan-tastic, not to mention heaven's gift to sportswriting. 
</P>
<P>
 So without further ado, let's get ready for these sure-to-come stories: 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley announces his plans, relative to his season, career and future life. 
Not one will come true. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Coach Chris Ford, reportedly already grousing about Dominique Wilkins 
in private, goes public. A month should do it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics, who have announced they're a playoff contender, hold a 
players-only meeting when they discover they're not. Two weeks should do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell, whom the Lakers pump up every summer, nods off again in fall. 
Oh, it's already happened? Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo Mourning is named player of the month for December. Charlotte owner 
George Shinn gives him a $150-million extension. 
</P>
<P>
 After a New York slump in January, an anonymous player rips Knick Coach Pat 
Riley. Riley fines Anthony Mason $10,000. When Riley subsequently learns the 
leak came from Patrick Ewing, he fines Mason another $5,000 for having been a 
bad influence on Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
 On a San Antonio trip in March, Coach Bob Hill rips Rodman's headphones off, 
discovers he's listening to a Madonna CD and fines him another $10,000 for 
harboring fantasies on a team charter. This raises Worm's season total to $2.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando goes 65-17 but is swept in the first round by New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana comes out of the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix comes out of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers win the NBA title in seven games. During the victory parade in 
Indianapolis, Larry Brown announces he's going back to UCLA, noting his 
decision to leave was the biggest mistake in his life. "Both times," he says. 
IT'S NOT JUST A JOB, IT'S AN ADVENTURE 
</P>
<P>
 And now back to real life, more or less. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Robert (Call Me General) McDermott, retired Air Force one-star and newly 
arrived chairman of the Spurs' board, has cracked a few tough nuts in his time, 
so Rodman had better watch out. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the General can't jail Worm or make him clean the Alamodome 
latrines or shoot him for deserting in the face of the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Never fear, there's always a way to instill discipline in a young man. How 
about. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Busting him down for violating the dress code? 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect! When the Spurs announced they were suspending Rodman for three games 
-- $90,740 worth, added to his previous $15,000 fine for a preseason total of 
$105,740 -- they cited seven acts of "conduct detrimental to the team" but 
wouldn't describe them. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder. One was reportedly wearing blue jeans on the team charter. Designer 
jeans are permitted but Rodman had the common kind on. 
</P>
<P>
 Another was assault on a superior officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman, taken out of an exhibition game, picked up an ice bag and flipped it a 
few feet. One wire service reported that he had thrown it at Coach Hill, 
although he obviously had not. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hill, defending the sentencing: "I mean, c'mon. This is the way the world 
works." 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, c'mon? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new para-military standards, Rodman, who habitually came late to 
practices, blew off shoot-arounds on the theory that he didn't intend to shoot 
in the game and rarely spoke to teammates off the floor, would have missed all 
last season, forfeiting his $2.5-million salary plus whatever the Spurs fined 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he wouldn't have taken down his league-leading 1,367 rebounds -- 
Shaquille O'Neal was next at 1,072. The Spurs wouldn't have improved their 
defensive average by eight points or won six more games. 
</P>
<P>
 John Lucas, who traded for Rodman, kept him from being a distraction by 
overlooking everything but Luke wisely bailed out when he got a look at the 
General. 
</P>
<P>
 From Philadelphia, Lucas says he'd love to have Rodman back. However, like 
Jack Nicholson in "A Few Good Men," McDermott wants to train the young man, 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope it works out better for His Generalship than it did for Jack. HOW 
TO TELL YOU'VE BEEN AROUND TOO LONG 
</P>
<P>
 How to explain trading Rony Seikaly, a top-10 center, for Billy Owens to join 
the Miami Heat's crowded stable of small forwards? 
</P>
<P>
 How about temporary insanity? 
</P>
<P>
 NBA combat fatigue? 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Cunningham and Lew Schaffel were on their way out as part owners of the 
Heat, frustrated by their inability to get a once-promising young team beyond 
mediocrity and tired of their players' whining. 
</P>
<P>
 Seikaly, prone to the European-born players' habit of assuming the fetal 
position when things got tough, bought his ticket to ride when he blasted 
management for letting Brian Shaw go. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Seikaly: "Since then, they have not said a word to me. It's like I don't 
exist, like I'm not part of the team, like I don't belong. I'm happy to be 
leaving that situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Schaffel: "Under no circumstance would we trade a player if we didn't 
believe the Heat would benefit from that trade. Under no circumstances. We 
never put personality ahead of what's best and we never will." 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't explain why a team with Glen Rice at small forward, which just 
signed Kevin Gamble to back him up, needs Owens, who has never become the star 
he was once projected to be. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, who needs to explain? 
</P>
<P>
 In a few months, Billy and Lew will be on the beach with millions in the bank 
saying, "What, me worry?" THANK HEAVEN NAISMITH DIDN'T LIVE TO SEE THIS 
</P>
<P>
 Benoit Benjamin just started his 10th professional season, still the same big 
lug who sprawled upon the scene in 1985: out of shape, out of his element, out 
of it in general. 
</P>
<P>
 New Net Coach Butch Beard says Benjamin isn't in condition, but Beard doesn't 
know how bad Benoit's condition can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm right where I want to be," Benjamin said. "I've done everything. I've 
been in camp every day. I've practiced every day, except two days. I'm in great 
shape, give or take five pounds. Really and truly, They (critics) can kiss my . 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "People saying that I'm an underachiever really gets under my skin. I've 
achieved some things in this league. People need to recognize that. I feel 
underappreciated. I feel like I'm a great player. I figure I'll have my place 
in the history books one day." 
</P>
<P>
 He can count on it. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back in the asylum: Houston players are upset that President 
Clinton hasn't invited them to the White House, that team owner Les Alexander 
got a reduced price from a Canadian firm to make their rings, that no one is 
predicting they'll repeat, by more things than we have space to list. Said 
Robert Horry: "The 16 hours I was in Detroit (in the abortive Sean Elliott 
trade), you could tell by the way they run their organization that it was first 
class. I ain't going to say (Alexander) is cheap. I'll just say he budgets his 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket Vice President John Thomas notes Clinton had some other things to 
attend to just as important -- the Middle East, campaigns -- but that the trip 
is on, adding the players are getting bad information from someone "trying to 
divide this organization." Maybe someone in the old PR department, which 
Alexander purged? . . . Even Chicago Bull fans who paid $100 a ticket were 
turned off by Michael Jordan's made-for-TV tribute. Chicago Tribune columnist 
Bernie Lincicome suggested that Fabio must have been too busy to attend. Said 
Jordan: "Me, personally, I really didn't need all of this. All I really needed 
was to say goodby to the Chicago fans, and I think I did that the last time I 
was in the Stadium (at Scottie Pippen's charity game in September)." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for your unique perspective: Bull owner Jerry Reinsdorf on Pippen's 
mutiny last spring: "The 1.8-second incident was blown way out of proportion. 
We had blown a big lead. He was frustrated and did a dumb thing. After the game 
he apologized and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte's Larry Johnson, replying to critics of his schoolyard act at the 
World Championships and showing that he, truly, doesn't understand: "Look where 
I'm at, one of the premier players in the league, hands down, no doubt about 
it, one of the top players in the league, healthy. No doubts about it, can't 
nobody dispute that. I've won a lot of accolades, rookie of the year. I've 
earned a lot of things being me. I've got to be me. If I get criticism being 
LJ, then I get criticism. I've got to be me. I've got to be LJ. I've done 
pretty good so far. LJ's got some friends, some people like me. My mom likes 
me. My wife likes me. I'm doing all right. I'd rather have the criticism now 
about trash talking than have the criticism if we'd lost the game. How would we 
live that down? See, a lot of people thought they knew about the young guns, 
but they didn't know about the young guns. I think they know now."

LEBOW WILL BE BIG PART OF SILVER MARATHON; RUNNING: ORGANIZER WOULD HAVE WANTED 
TODAY'S 25TH EDITION OF NEW YORK CITY RACE TO BE WON BY AN AMERICAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the corner of 67th Street and West Drive, at the end of a corridor of 
portable grandstands and under a street light in Central Park, a statue was 
unveiled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Lebow didn't live to see the 25th running of his race, the New York City 
Marathon, but his tribute in bronze -- a bearded man in billed cap, peering 
down at a watch on his left wrist -- looks out over the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the first pigeon can call the statue home, Lebow's fondest wish could 
be granted -- with the help of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebow wanted to see another American winner in New York. None has won here 
since Alberto Salazar in 1982. No American woman has won since Miki Gorman in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 As two of the United States' newest citizens, Olga Appell and Arturo Barrios 
might get a bigger charge out of the Statue of Liberty than one of Fred Lebow. 
But as two of the United States' leading marathon runners, the lures are more 
likely Grover Cleveland, Salmon P. Chase and Woodrow Wilson -- the faces on 
$1,000, $10,000 and $100,000 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 When Appell and Barrios raised their hands and swore allegiance to the United 
States, they vowed to protect and defend their rights to double their prize 
money if they finish in the top five in their divisions today, and to collect a 
$100,000 bonus if they win as Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could be talking about a $200,000 day, with interval-record money," said 
Brian Appell, Olga's husband and coach. 
</P>
<P>
 As the top returning finishers from a year ago, and training at their peaks, 
Appell and Barrios are among the top contenders. The forecast, for a warm and 
humid day, heightens their chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hotter the better," said Appell, a 31-year-old mother of two who became a 
U.S. citizen on Feb. 25, shortly before winning the Los Angeles Marathon in 2 
hours 28 minutes 12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she doesn't have to ask Mexico's track federation if she can run. She 
doesn't have to send a portion of her winnings to Mexico. Like many immigrants, 
she came to America for freedom -- in her case, freedom to run wherever she 
wants, whenever she wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have the stress they put on me," she said. "I could be more 
flexible, run where I want. I didn't have to worry about their criticism 
because I am a Mexican runner with an American coach. I'm proud of what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 She tuned up for this race, which she calls her most important, by winning the 
Fukuoka Marathon in Japan in 2:36 without pushing herself, and by finishing 
second in Chula Vista, running 10 kilometers in 31:46. 
</P>
<P>
 Appell was 32 seconds behind Germany's Uta Pippig last year in New York. 
Pippig added a Boston Marathon victory to her sensational year and has signed a 
contract with Reebok worth a reported $250,000, with bonuses for top 
performances in big races. It begins on Nov. 15, which explains her absence 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Appell will deal with Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., who was second 
here in 1989 and has run the fastest time of any American woman at New York, 
2:28:54. She dropped out at 17 miles last year because of an asthma attack, but 
has been taking drugs to control the disease and declares herself ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Marie Letko, who grew up in New York and lives in Marietta, Ga., is the 
hometown favorite and is using the race to prove she can run a marathon after 
dropping out at 19 miles last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of foreign women includes Nadia Prasad of France, who won the Chula 
Vista 10K, beating Appell by eight seconds and knocking 19 seconds off Pippig's 
course mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrios, who became a U.S. citizen on Sept. 16 after a dispute of his own with 
the Mexican federation, won the U.S. 10,000-meter championship. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished third last year in New York in 2:12:21, 2:17 behind winner Andres 
Espinosa of Mexico and 1:18 behind Bob Kempainen of Minnesota. Espinosa is 
passing up this race for Japanese money to run a marathon in December. 
Kempainen is not running here. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Barrios, whose fifth-place finish in Boston was almost four 
minutes faster than in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 His main competition will probably be South Africa's Willie Mtolo, who 
celebrated the lifting of the international ban against his country by winning 
the 1992 New York Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Rousseau of Belgium ran a 2:07:51 in winning at Rotterdam, but that 
was not in the heat and humidity he might face today. They are conditions he 
detests, so much so that he said Friday he would not run in the 1996 Olympics 
in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 German Silva of Mexico calls himself the favorite, in his second marathon. His 
first was a 2:09:18, which was good for third in Rotterdam. Salvador Garcia, 
also of Mexico, beat Espinosa in winning here in 1991 and returns today. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenya is represented by Michael Kapkiai, Sammy Lelei and Josphat Ndeti, 
brother of two-time Boston winner Cosmas. 
</P>
<P>
 They will join 27,000 runners on the Verrazano Narrows Bridge this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Five boroughs, 26 miles and 385 yards later, the winner will be greeted by 
Central Park's newest statue, whose subject, Fred Lebow, would consider it his 
greatest tribute if the first runner there is an American.

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; TV SAYS JUMP: THEY ASK, 'WHAT DAY?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The great god television has reared its head again, persuading promoters of 
the Newsweek Champions Cup at Indian Wells to move their final next March from 
the more traditional Sunday to late Monday afternoon so that it can be 
televised, delayed, during prime time in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally scheduled for March 12, the final of the ATP Tour's first Super 
Nine event of 1995 now is set to start at 4 p.m. on March 13, with television 
coverage starting two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN, which will televise the event, requested the switch to avoid conflicts 
with its coverage of college basketball conference tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterfinals of the tournament have been moved from Friday to Saturday, 
the semifinals from Saturday to Sunday. The tournament will have a traditional 
Monday starting date on March 6. 
</P>
<P>
 One semifinal will be shown by ESPN, delayed, at 9 p.m. EST on March 12. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN told tournament organizers that, because of a glut of college basketball 
games on the final weekend of the regular season, it could not fit tennis into 
its Saturday schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Look, we can put you on in prime time on Monday night,' " said 
tournament director Charlie Pasarell. "And so the tour and ESPN and us, we 
felt, 'That's an interesting twist.' 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us felt that this was almost a blessing in disguise. It's an 
opportunity for us to get on Monday night prime time. That's a very good time 
allotment. So we said, 'Let's do it. Let's see how it goes.' We look at it from 
the perspective of, what started as a problem ended up being a new opportunity 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indian Wells final is the only one of the year that will be played on a 
Monday. The scheduling was possible because the U.S. event that follows it on 
the tour calendar, the Lipton Championships in Key Biscayne, Fla., does not 
start until Friday, March 17. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kevin O'Keefe, the ATP Tour's director of communications for the Americas, 
does not necessarily see it as a one-time shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see us be creative in everything we do, so I think it's safe 
to say we'll be looking at (Monday finals) for other events," he said. "We'd 
like to see what the reaction to it is, not just from the folks on site but 
also the ESPN viewership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take a wait-and-see attitude here, but we think it's a great 
idea, having gone over all of the other possibilities of what we could have 
done with those extra couple of days. It gives us a prime-time vehicle, which 
we've never had before." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, with an extra day to complete the tournament, organizers will be able to 
present more matches on the stadium court during the early rounds. Night 
sessions will be held Monday-Saturday, with the quarterfinals split between 
afternoon and night sessions on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasarell said that reaction to the change has mostly been positive but that he 
has received complaints from a few longtime season-ticket and box holders. 
</P>
<P>
 His response? 
</P>
<P>
 "No sporting league or sporting event, football included, can survive without 
television exposure, and television and sponsorship revenues," he said. "We're 
no different. We have to have television coverage. Without it, we just could 
not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so, we have to present a good television package. Therefore, we made this 
adjustment." 
</P>

 Michael Chang, winner of the Salem Open in Beijing last month, has won seven 
tournaments and nearly 90% of his matches in Asia during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning tournaments last year in Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, Osaka and 
Jakarta, he won this year in Hong Kong, Beijing and Jakarta. He also reached 
the final of two tournaments in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me to win any event in Asia is very special," said Chang, who is of 
Chinese extraction. "There's a special place in my heart for Asia, just because 
the people there haven't been exposed to tennis as they have been here in the 
States or in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think tennis is really starting to catch on there, and for me it's very 
encouraging. It helps me to concentrate just that little bit extra to try to 
inspire those kids to go out and give tennis a try because there aren't a lot 
of courts out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me to do well over there, I think the people can relate to me better than 
they would a guy like Pete (Sampras), for example, just because I come from an 
Asian background. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look at me and see that I'm not any bigger than they are, I don't have 
anything special about me. I'm just a normal Asian person, and I think it's 
encouraging for them to see somebody of their own kind doing well in a sport 
that is dominated by players who are much bigger and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras and Martina Navratilova are among "the 25 fittest people of the year," 
according to Fitness magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those also making the list were Madonna, Demi Moore, Tina Turner, 
Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jamie Lee Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, no golfers or baseball players were named. Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyatt Grand Champions in Indian Wells, host of the Evert Cup and the 
Newsweek Champions Cup Feb. 27-March 13, will conduct tryouts for ball kids 10 
and older on Nov. 17, Dec. 15 and Jan. 19. Details: (619) 340-3166. . . . Said 
Pete Sampras, who grew a beard during a tournament in Stockholm: "My girlfriend 
wanted me to try it. She says it makes her happy. And when she's happy, I'm 
happy."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / STEVE HENSON: FOR SOME, END IS NEAR -- MAYBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing is more melancholy for a senior football player than to know he is 
suiting up for the last time. Avoiding this feeling requires playoff hopes, a 
mathematical possibility that victory in the regular-season finale will extend 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, there is nothing on the line, nothing to play for but memories 
triggered by knee pain when the weather dampens. 
</P>
<P>
 With one week to play in the regular season, teams can be grouped in three 
categories: 
</P>
<P>
 The Merry -- those who have qualified for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maybes -- those who are playing for entry this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most interesting are the Maybes. Some control their own destiny. Others must 
win and hope for help. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the Maybes in area Southern Section Division II and Division III 
leagues: 
</P>
<P>
 GOLDEN LEAGUE: By eschewing a short field-goal attempt in the waning seconds 
and losing to Ridgecrest Burroughs, 23-20, Friday night, Quartz Hill (2-1-1 in 
league play) is in danger of missing the playoffs. The Rebels must upset 
first-place Antelope Valley or hope Burroughs defeats Highland (2-2) to be 
assured of a berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland gets in by coupling a victory over Burroughs with an Antelope Valley 
victory over Quartz Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: Quartz Hill and Highland both lose, enabling Quartz Hill to back 
into third place. 
</P>
<P>
 CHANNEL LEAGUE: Only league champion Buena (4-0-2) is Merry so far. Oxnard, 
San Marcos and Ventura are 4-2 and Santa Barbara is 3-2-1. That's a lot of 
Maybes. Oxnard plays Ventura, with the winner making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: Santa Barbara qualifies by coupling a victory over Rio Mesa with a 
San Marcos loss to Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 MARMONTE LEAGUE: By defeating Simi Valley on Friday night, Newbury Park (4- 2) 
is almost assured of qualifying along with league champion Westlake (6-0) and 
second-place Royal (5-1). Agoura (4-2), which lost to Newbury Park earlier, 
must defeat Westlake and hope for Thousand Oaks to upset Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: Westlake beats Agoura, making the game between Newbury Park and 
Thousand Oaks interesting mostly for the matchup of rapidly improving sophomore 
quarterbacks Chris Czernek and Scott McEwan. On Friday, Newbury Park's Czernek 
passed for 236 yards and Thousand Oaks' McEwan passed for 163. 
</P>
<P>
 MISSION LEAGUE: Four 1-3 teams, including St. Francis, are vying for the third 
playoff berth behind Notre Dame (4-0) and Chaminade (4-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: St. Francis uses its fourth fumblerooski of the season to defeat 
fading St. Bernard and qualify for the playoffs when Serra knocks off Bishop 
Montgomery. St. Francis has beaten Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate Maybe is finishing fourth, which delays a Merry or Melancholy 
feeling until wild-card berths are chosen and playoff pairings are announced 
next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Swarm of Maybes: The City Section, in its vast wisdom, created a playoff 
structure this season that ensures 49 Maybes among its 49 teams. Not a single 
school is certain its season will end next week. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee will determine Nov. 11 who qualifies for the 16-team 4-A and 
16-team 3-A brackets. Only conference champions are assured of making the 4-A, 
but their seeding will be determined by the committee. League champions and 
second-place conference finishers are in the playoffs but could be either 4-A 
or 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Criteria for selection include strength of league, overall record and league 
record, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go over all this stuff and it will drive you nuts," Sylmar Coach Jeff 
Engilman said. Sylmar and Taft are the only Valley schools assured of 4-A 
berths. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: Kennedy and the winners of this week's San Fernando-Granada Hills 
and Reseda-Monroe games also will make the 4-A. The loser of the San 
Fernando-Granada Hills game might squeeze in. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys, Chatsworth and Cleveland will make the 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddity: The loser of the Reseda-Monroe game probably will be dropped to the 
3-A bracket, greatly enhancing its chance of winning a City championship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Face-to-face: The most exciting pair of games this week won't involve Maybes. 
At Notre Dame High and at College of the Canyons, teams unbeaten in league play 
will face off for championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (8-1, 4-0) plays host to Chaminade (7-2, 4-0) in a Mission League 
matchup.  
</P>
<P>
 And Hart (9-0, 3-0), the area's No. 1-ranked team, puts its unbeaten record on 
the line in a Foothill League game against Saugus (5-2-1, 3-0), which has 
overcome a midseason slump to win three in a row.

HEADS-UP PLAYER; KIM PICKUP OF CHATSWORTH MAKES TRANSITION FROM SOCCER TO 
VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kim Pickup demonstrates exceptional athleticism in whatever sport she plays. 
</P>
<P>
 In soccer, the Chatsworth High junior executes an innovative throw-in 
technique that features a running start from behind the sideline, a handstand 
on top of the ball and a front flip before she flings the ball into play. The 
flip gives Pickup extra momentum and adds 10 yards to her throwing distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took about a month of practicing to do it right consistently," said 
Pickup, who had 10 years of gymnastics training. ". . . I think the other team 
is a little stunned whenever I do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickup's athletic ability has helped her make a quick adjustment to 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she entered this season with only one year of junior varsity 
experience, Pickup has evolved into an important member of a Chatsworth team 
that finished the regular season with only one loss in Northwest Valley 
Conference play and tied El Camino Real for the West Valley League title. 
Chatsworth, seeded second in the City Section 4-A playoffs, hosts Narbonne on 
Monday at 7 p.m. in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's natural for us at outside hitter because she is such a great leaper," 
said Chatsworth Coach Bud Dow, who is in his first season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickup enjoys volleyball, but describes her participation as an athletic 
diversion from soccer. Twice a week, she practices with the Diamond Bar-Walnut 
Wild Things, an elite 18-and-under club soccer team. Pickup, 16, is one of the 
youngest players on the team, which attracts players from Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickup's soccer commitment sometimes forces her to leave volleyball practice 
early. And the first time it happened, her teammates looked on in disbelief. 
Fall practice had just begun and the Chancellors were learning a new system 
under a new coach. The players thought Pickup couldn't afford to miss practice 
if she wanted to play on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teammates didn't quite understand and they were upset," Pickup said. "Once 
they realized I take soccer as seriously as they take volleyball, they 
understand a lot more when I have to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know she's playing for one of the top (soccer) teams around and can respect 
the commitment she has to soccer," Dow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth's volleyball practices usually end around 4 p.m., giving Pickup 
just enough time for a quick stop at home to change clothes before streaking 
across the Valley to Van Nuys for two-to-three-hour soccer practices that begin 
at 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I change clothes in the car," Pickup said. "But I would never miss 
soccer. It's too important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wild Things play games on Saturdays and Sundays at several sites in Los 
Angeles. Later this month, the team will break for the high school soccer 
season. Pickup, a fullback, will return to the Chatsworth girls' soccer team, 
which lost in the City Section semifinals last season. 
</P>
<P>
 After the high school season, Pickup will return to the Wild Things to compete 
in the State Cup, an organization that includes club teams from throughout 
Southern California. If Pickup's team wins the Cup, it qualifies for a regional 
tournament in Boise, Ida., in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Abner Rogers, who has coached Pickup's club teams for the past three years and 
guided her under-16 team to a third-place finish in a national tournament in 
1993, said Pickup has an excellent chance to earn a college scholarship. "Kim 
is very athletic. She would do well in any sport she tried," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickup began her volleyball experiment playing exclusively on the front row 
for the junior varsity last year. She spent most of this year's preseason 
working on her passing and defense to make herself an all-around player, and 
now splits time at outside hitter with Nicole Snell. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the one who is always diving and hitting the floor for loose balls," 
teammate Michelle George said. "Her soccer skills help her anticipate where the 
ball is going." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickup warms up in volleyball practice by hitting balls with George, also a 
soccer player, and standout outside hitter Jennifer Hodges. The extra sessions 
boost her confidence when she plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "This season has been a lot of fun for me," she said. "This is my break from 
soccer. I just couldn't sit around. I have to play something. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice if could play volleyball past next year but my heart is set 
on a soccer scholarship. For now, I just want to enjoy it as much as I can and 
help us win the City championship."

IT'S NOT GOOD AS GOLD, IT'S BETTER; BOXING: FOREMAN HITS THE JACKPOT IN LAS 
VEGAS WITH HIS SHOCKING VICTORY OVER MOORER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 At 45, George Foreman experienced the thrill of a lifetime Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning the title the first time didn't touch winning the gold medal in the 
Olympic Games," he said after leveling Michael Moorer in the 10th round with a 
right hand to the jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is the greatest thrill of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman was behind by five points on each of two scorecards and, somehow, by 
only one on the other when he delivered the punch that dethroned a man 19 years 
younger and shocked 12,000 eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was a combination that sent Moorer to the canvas -- a left to the 
forehead and then the right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he wasn't going to get up," Foreman, attired in a suit and hiding his 
swollen eyes behind dark glasses, said at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit him a few other times with good right hands, but they were short 
punches. This time I got body English into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Former World Boxing Assn. and International Boxing Federation champion Moorer, 
the first to be interviewed after the fight, said he never saw the punch 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a sneaky right," said Moorer, who also wore dark glasses. "It was 
something we had worked on a lot in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teddy (trainer Teddy Atlas) wanted me to keep circling to the right to stay 
away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the big lead on the two cards, Moorer said he never thought about 
playing it cautiously the last three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going to let up," he said. "He caught me. What can I say? The best 
man won tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boxing is a sport that has winners and losers. The only thing that hurts is 
that I called my son and he was crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rest of the people who watched on TV must have been cheering. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was for the 45- to 55-year-old athletes," Foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
 What will be the subject of Rev. Foreman's sermon today in Houston? 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let anybody tell you what you can't do . . . and don't go to Vegas and 
bet against me." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman was asked if he realized he was losing the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scores didn't matter," he said. "I thought I would knock him out in the 
11th round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to knock him down in one of the late rounds because I knew he 
wouldn't get up then." 
</P>
<P>
 But did he feel a sense of urgency as his eyes swelled, Moorer kept firing 
quicker and sharper punches, and time was running out? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I just felt half-blind," he cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman looked like a 45-year-old fighter -- slow and sluggish -- until the 
last punch of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Only his strength, heart, and a rigorous conditioning program got him as far 
as the 10th round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in great condition," Foreman said. "It was all that running on the 
beach at Malibu that did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yes, one other thing kept him going. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got tired of being introduced as the former heavyweight champion of the 
world," said the new heavyweight champion of the world.

BAKERSFIELD HEADS OFF VALLEY AT PASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Add one more disappointment to the lurid tale of Valley College football 
against Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a phenomenal passing night by quarterback Jim Arellanes, the Monarchs 
could do little to stop the powerful Bakersfield running attack and dropped a 
51-37 Western State Conference Southern Division game Saturday night at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 13th consecutive loss for Valley (7-1, 7-1 in conference play) 
against the Renegades (7-1, 6-1) and gave Bakersfield sole claim to the top 
spot in the division at 4-0. Valley dropped to 3-1 and probably lost any chance 
at dethroning the two-time defending champion Renegades. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes passed for a school-record 635 yards. Arrellanes completed 30 of 52 
passes but had four intercepted. Arellanes had thrown only three interceptions 
going into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer from Northern Arizona has passed for 2,717 yards this season. But 
all those yards failed to keep Valley's unbeaten streak alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Renegades turned a 23-21 halftime deficit into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
 They scored on their first two possessions of the third quarter, first on a 
one-yard run by Tommy Criner and later on a 24-yard field goal by Robert Nycz 
to take a 31-23 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After a one-yard run by Deriek Charles got Valley to within 31-29 after three 
quarters, Bakersfield poured it on with three more touchdowns in the final 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs jumped on Bakersfield at the outset. They marched 76 yards in 11 
plays on the first possession and took a 6-0 lead on a one-yard run by Johnnie 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley then took advantage of a fumble by George Jones at the Bakersfield 20 
late in the quarter and scored two plays later on a 23-yard pass from Arellanes 
to receiver Jason Leonard. Charles converted the two-point run for a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard finished with nine catches for a 204 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield pulled even, 14-14, on a 16-yard pass from quarterback Danny Henry 
to receiver Charles Woolfolk and on a five-yard run by Mike Gray with 8 minutes 
10 seconds left before the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones led all rushers with 158 yards and Gray had 157. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley's Brian Comer had seven receptions for 227 yards.

GEOGRAPHY NOT IN LESSON PLAN; FOOTBALL: SMITH LEARNS NEW POSITION PLAYING 
CANADIAN FOOTBALL IN SACRAMENTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The words are slightly muffled, both by the crackle of a long-distance phone 
line and a sizable wad of chewing tobacco, but Tommie Smith's message is clear: 
The one-time terror of the Southern Section is alive and well in the Canadian 
Football League as a member of the Sacramento Gold Miners. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who led Antelope Valley High to the 1988 Southern Division II title and 
went on to earn four letters as a strong safety at the University of 
Washington, is now a sometimes-starting linebacker for Sacramento, one of four 
U.S. teams in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento, 9-8-1, will miss the fourth and final playoff berth in the CFL's 
six-team Western Division.  
</P>
<P>
 Beyond this weekend, however, the franchise's stability is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors that the team will move to Oakland after the season were recently 
confirmed as "at least 75% true" by a team publicist. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that seems to bother Smith. Signed in 1993 as a free agent by the 
National Football League's Seattle Seahawks and then cut at the end of that 
summer's training camp, he is not pining for an NFL shot, and has fit right in 
with Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done very, very well for a rookie; he's been productive for us," said 
Bill Urbanik, the Gold Miners' defensive coordinator and a former defensive 
line coach and player personnel staff member for the Raiders.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a heck of a future as a CFL linebacker because he fits the mold in 
terms of size, speed, toughness and explosion. He has a real nose for the 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 Urbanik's last comment is readily apparent from a quick glance at the 
Sacramento stat sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Smith spent five weeks of the season on the practice squad and missed 
five games, the Lancaster native enters tonight's game eighth on the team in 
tackles with 33, and has two interceptions, nine special-teams tackles and a 
fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a guy better acquainted with the wide-open spaces of the secondary 
than the hand-to-hand combat near the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like (linebacker) better," Smith said. "It's more physical. I couldn't 
really expect more from the first year because I'm a rookie. But being on the 
practice squad gave me a better feel for the defense, for the (pass coverage) 
and who I'm supposed to read. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still improve on the run, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having to bone up on the ground game, Smith already knew enough to 
offer the current players at Antelope Valley some pointers during a two-day 
stretch of spring practice last May. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, USA Today's California player of the year in 1988, taught the Antelope 
defensive backs the intricacies of zone coverage and gave the high school 
players some tips on what to look for should they continue up the football 
ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them what to expect about playing college football," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just a lot more stuff you have to remember and new systems to learn. 
The atmosphere is so different. I see myself in a lot of (the Antelope Valley 
players) and I was trying to tell them what I went through." 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Newcomb, Antelope Valley's coach for the past 17 years and a big admirer 
of Smith's, said his former player commanded instant respect from 1994 team 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice for the kids to look up to someone who's been through our program 
and had a little success. They really listen to him," said Newcomb, who also 
has had coaching help this season from former Antelope Valley lineman James 
Richards, now with the CFL's Las Vegas Posse. "Tommie's a semi-celebrity around 
this town. You could be over on Sierra Highway and hear him play because of the 
hits he dished out. He's one of my favorite players ever."  
</P>
<P>
 The recent events with the most impact on Smith's life have not come on the 
field, however. His wife, Angie, gave birth to a son, Reiley, in Sacramento 
three months ago. Smith missed a day of practice for the event, joining his 
wife's parents in what he says was one of the brightest moments of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Smith was placed on the Gold Miners' practice roster, however, Angie 
moved to Bend, Ore., to live with her parents, a difficult separation for both. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith plans a relocation to the Portland area after the season and possibly 
using a CFL continuing education program to pay for a final year of college at 
Portland State or another area school.  
</P>
<P>
 But as far as taking another shot at the NFL, he's not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he's not even that sure when it comes to the CFL. The Gold Miners 
have an option on whether to renew his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably stay with the Gold Miners, wherever they are," Smith said. "I'd 
rather have that security than (a tryout with an NFL team)."

RECREATION / STEVE HENSON: COMPETITION CALLS THEM BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The competitive fire burns even after reality bites like a cold shower. 
Therein lies the quandary for former college and professional athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Sharts and Chris Parker, among others, have gone to extraordinary 
lengths to delay throwing in the towel for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds no longer cheer them and they aren't paid. But they've found ways to 
compete in the sports they love, to share a touch of glory with longtime 
friends and teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharts, a former Cal State Northridge All-American baseball player who played 
three years in the minor leagues, helped the Simi Valley Pirates to the 
National Adult Baseball Assn. World Series championship last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, a former Northridge and Arena Football League quarterback, is leading 
a group of mostly former Matador football players into NFL Air-It-Out 
four-on-four flag football competition at Balboa Park this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go out there with the intention of winning and are very serious, but we 
also just like throwing the ball around," said Parker, whose teammates are Dan 
Coleman, Robert Guillen, Damon Orlando and Danny Fernandez, who played for the 
San Francisco Giants' triple-A affiliate this past season. 
</P>
<P>
 The NABA and NFL Air-It-Out are national organizations for adults who refuse 
to stop playing kids' games. Win enough and you can call yourself a national 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Pirates do. They posted a 48-3-1 record during a six-month 
season, winning a local league to qualify for the 19-team World Series, held in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Most players hold down full-time jobs, so making games at the week-long series 
required great effort. 
</P>
<P>
 After missing the first three games, Sharts drove all night to accompany the 
team. Without getting a wink of sleep, he pitched a complete-game, 2-1 victory 
over Oklahoma in a game that began at 7:30 a.m. Simi Valley trailed in the 
bottom of the ninth and faced elimination, but rallied for the winning runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was yelling and screaming in the ninth that I didn't drive all this way to 
play one game and drive home," Sharts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley defeated Baltimore, 10-7, in its next game behind the pitching of 
Trevor Leppard and hitting of Kevin Nykoluk to advance to the final against 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Ninneman, 30, a former minor league right-hander from Newbury Park High, 
pitched eight innings of the final, an 11-8 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Santos, a former Simi Valley High player, led the team in hitting with a 
.700 series average. 
</P>
<P>
 Another recognizable member of the team was Scott Radinsky, the Chicago White 
Sox reliever who is home in Simi Valley recovering from Hodgkin's disease. 
Radinsky played first base for the NABA champs, delivering several key hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky made only two pitches in the tournament, saving a victory over New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were celebrating right after winning it, Radinsky yelled out, 'Who 
needs the White Sox? This is my World Series,' " said Russ Stephans, the team's 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky, of course, will return to the White Sox, but the others plan to 
continue with the NABA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting together with these guys is great," Sharts said. "I'm already looking 
forward to next season. I know I won't get baseball out of my system." 
</P>
<P>
 For Parker, 29, and his pals, football is the game they can't leave behind. 
Parker, Coleman and Guillen were Northridge teammates in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL Air-It-Out, a widely popular event sponsored by two prominent beverage 
companies, enables them to remain in the same huddle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do it for the fun of it, but we want to win one of these darn things," 
said Coleman, who has played in Air-It-Out tournaments for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the tournament, which concludes today, plays at the L.A. 
Coliseum for the state championship against the winner of an earlier tournament 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The state winner qualifies for the 19-team Air-It-Out Super Bowl, to be held 
in Orlando, Fla., in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Bowl champion plays a team of NFL All-Stars, which last year 
included Roger Staubach, Terrell Buckley, Glyn Milburn, Anthony Carter and Cris 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to win the whole thing," said Parker, whose three-year Arena 
football career was ended by a knee injury in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still not cleared by a doctor to play. When I walk, my knee hurts. When I 
sit, my knee hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Air-It-Out is non-contact football, and the knee doesn't stop Parker from 
throwing tight spirals, so . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way to stay competitive," he said. "That's the biggest thing I 
miss."

BREEDERS' CUP ROUNDUP; YOUTH IS SERVED AS LUKAS SWEEPS JUVENILE RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Wayne Lukas, who hadn't won a Breeders' Cup race since 1989, bagged 
two of them at Churchill Downs Saturday and came within a neck of equaling the 
three-victory day that he had here in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas saddled 2-year-olds Timber Country and Flanders to win their races, but 
his Tabasco Cat failed to win the Breeders' Cup Classic when Concern 
outfinished the colt in the final yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we would have had one more jump (with Tabasco Cat)," Lukas said. "It 
was a great day, but you always like to win one more and it just wasn't in the 
cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas emerged with the early favorite for the 1994 Kentucky Derby in Timber 
Country, who has won stakes at Del Mar, Belmont Park and now the Derby track 
while winning four of his last five starts. The only blot on his record during 
that stretch was a third-place finish in the Del Mar Futurity, and on Saturday 
he beat On Target and Supremo, the horses who finished ahead of him at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had several hundred horses together, and Wayne's never been higher than 
he is on this horse," said William T. Young, the Lexington, Ky., horseman who 
owns Timber Country in a partnership with Graham Beck, another Kentuckian, and 
Bob and Beverly Lewis of Newport Beach. Timber Country, the son of Woodman and 
an 18-year-old mare, Fall Aspen, who has produced three other major stakes 
winners, was bought at a yearling auction for $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Timber Country, paying $6.80, finished two lengths ahead of Eltish, the 
English colt who had never run on dirt. Tejano Run rallied from last place to 
finish third, another three lengths back. Timber Country's time was 1:44 2/5 
for 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Timber Country moved up from seventh place after a half-mile, and his jockey, 
Pat Day, was able to find room along the rail through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I slapped him once, but he really didn't even need that," Day said. "He was 
probably saying, 'What's he doing that to me for?"' 
</P>
<P>
 In other Breeders' Cup races: 
</P>
<P>
 -- One Dreamer, at 47-1, prevailed over a classy Distaff field by getting an 
early lead and holding off the 2-1 Heavenly Prize by a neck. Miss Dominique ran 
third, while Hollywood Wildcat, the winner of last year's race, struggled with 
the track and finished sixth. Sky Beauty, undefeated this year, ran last. 
</P>
<P>
 One Dreamer, a 6-year-old mare bred and raced by Leonard Lavin and trained by 
Tom Proctor, almost died when she underwent surgery for a cyst on her stomach 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Allen Jerkens had no explanation for Sky Beauty's performance or Devil 
His Due's 11th-place finish in the Classic. "There's just no way I should ever 
come to this place," Jerkens said. "I never do any good." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Barathea gave the English a victory in the Mile, finishing a head in front 
of Johann Quatz. As the 9-10 favorite, Lure ran ninth in his bid for a third 
consecutive victory in the race. Barathea broke the track record with a time of 
1:34 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Luca Cumani, Barathea's trainer, got blueprints from Churchill Downs a couple 
of months ago and simulated the track's first turn at the Newmarket, England, 
track so the 4-year-old colt could familiarize himself. Barathea bore out badly 
on the first turn a year ago at Santa Anita, costing himself and several other 
horses all chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lovely trip around," jockey Frankie Dettori said of Barathea's race 
Saturday. Dettori is England's leading jockey this year, becoming only the 
third rider there to win more than 200 races in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Smith had problems from the start with Lure, who drew the outside post 
position in a 14-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just kind of went through the motions today," Smith said. "I think 
somebody (stepped on his heels) on the backside, because he went down behind. 
He came back after that, but he just didn't have it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tikkanen, though he is a Pennsylvania-bred and owned by American George 
Strawbridge Jr., had raced mostly in France before his 1 1/2-length victory 
over another French horse, Hatoof, in the Turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Smith, Tikkanen had won the Turf Classic at Belmont Park in his 
previous race. The 3-year-old colt, who is named after Esa Tikkanen, the St. 
Louis Blues' hockey player, ran 1 1/2 miles in 2:26 2/5, breaking the track 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cherokee Run, ridden by Smith, beat the filly Soviet Problem by a head in 
the Sprint, with Cardmania, last year's winner, finishing third, another 1 1/2 
lengths back.

FLANDERS HURT WHILE WINNING DUEL; JUVENILE FILLIES: CANNON-BONE INJURY TO RIGHT 
FORELEG REQUIRES SURGERY AFTER SHE OUTLASTS SERENA'S SONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Flanders, who has finished first in all five of her races, won a stretch-long 
duel with stablemate Serena's Song in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies on 
Saturday, but suffered a cannon-bone injury to her right foreleg and will 
undergo surgery Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Wayne Lukas said a pin will be inserted into the filly's leg and she 
is expected to race again.Wayne McIlwraith, one of the veterinarians on duty at 
Churchill Downs, said the injury is similar to the one suffered by Dehere, last 
year's champion 2-year-old colt. Dehere is training for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle between Flanders and Serena's Song reminded William T. Young, the 
owner of Flanders, of the 1988 Distaff, when Personal Ensign nosed out Winning 
Colors in what is considered by many to be the most exciting Breeders' Cup race 
ever run. One of Flanders' victories, in the Matron at Belmont Park, was taken 
away because she tested positive for an illegal drug. Another laboratory 
disagreed with that result, and the matter is still in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Day pulled up Flanders shortly after crossing the wire. "She was decidedly 
off (favoring her leg)," Day said. "I rode her awfully hard coming down the 
stretch. I didn't want to take a chance, and I opted to get off her." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanders was taken by van off the track. Lukas suspected that she might be 
hurting when she didn't switch lead feet, from the left to the right, in the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanders and her entrymate, Cat Appeal, went off as the 2-5 favorite. Serena's 
Song finished four lengths ahead of Stormy Blues, the third-place finisher. 
Flanders' time for 1 1/16 miles was 1:45 1/5. BILL CHRISTINE

CLEMENTS SETS KILL RECORD IN CSUN SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Missy Clements had 22 kills to become Cal State Northridge's all-time leader 
in a 15-4, 15-13, 15-5 sweep of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in a nonconference 
women's volleyball match Saturday night at Matador Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements, a 5-foot-11 senior outside hitter from La Habra High, needed 18 
kills to break Northridge's career record of 1,326 set by Kathleen Dixon from 
1987-90.After getting 10 kills in the first game, she had eight in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 The match was stopped after Clements' 18th kill, and she received a standing 
ovation from the crowd of 386 and congratulations from her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 She added four kills in the third game to increase her career total to 1,331 
with two matches left in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the third in a row for Northridge (15-8) and the fifth in its 
last six matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors had a .419 hitting percentage, four of six starters posting marks 
of .400 or better. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Anderson had 12 kills, 14 digs and three blocks for CSUN and Aimee 
Stone added nine kills.

HANCOCK CAN'T HOLD MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The situation appeared grim for Moorpark College when its leading rusher, Gary 
Clemons, went out with an ankle injury with the Raiders trailing in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorpark scored 38 consecutive points in the second and third quarters of 
a 45-21 victory over Hancock Saturday night in a Western State Conference 
Northern Division game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (6-2, 6-1 in the WSC) used the skills of wide receiver Isaiah 
Mustafa and Reginald Wilkes, Clemons' replacement, to come back from the early 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkes put the Raiders ahead to stay, 17-14, on a one-yard touchdown run in 
the waning moments of the first half. He added a 23-yard touchdown run early in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark wound up with 28 points in the quarter, including Mustafa's touchdown 
receptions of 48 and five yards on passes from Damian Delfino. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa had eight catches for 158 yards and Delfino completed 14 of 25 passes 
for 229 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner recorded his 100th victory in 16 seasons at the 
helm of the Raiders. His record is 100-60-2. 
</P>
<P>
 It also strengthened Moorpark's hopes of winning the division title and 
securing a postseason bowl berth. The Raiders are 3-0 in division games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider defense also made life miserable for Hancock quarterback Mark 
Sitarski, who threw for 162 yards but had three passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock (5-3, 4-3) managed just 74 yards rushing and lost two fumbles.

CAL LUTHERAN, THOMAS SMILE FOR THE CAMERA, 45-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Members of the Cal Lutheran football team will want to make plenty of copies 
of the videotape of Saturday night's 45-6 Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference victory over Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 When things start going sour, a peek at that tape is sure to bring a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen dominated all aspects of the game, rolling up 573 yards of 
offense. It was Cal Lutheran's third consecutive 400-yard performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt real good," quarterback Ryan Huisenga said. "The line was doing a 
spectacular job as well as the receivers. I didn't think I played that well, 
but the receivers did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 Huisenga's modesty aside, he was one of the standouts, although he had to take 
a back seat to tailback Terrence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas gained 195 yards and scored three touchdowns in 29 carries in only 
three quarters. The performance raised his season total to 1,134 yards, 
breaking the Cal Lutheran single-season record of 1,024, set by Hank Bauer in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas broke the record with a 56-yard scoring run in the second quarter. He 
also had scoring runs of three and nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's something special," Huisenga said of the senior running back. "We are 
going to miss him next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Huisenga had one of his best passing days of the season, completing 18 of 25 
passes for 238 yards and two touchdowns, also in three quarters.  
</P>
<P>
 He threw a 46-yard scoring pass to Jason Higbee. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran's defense held Whittier to 211 yards and 11 first downs. 
</P>
<P>
 By winning its third game in a row, Cal Lutheran evened its record at 4-4, 3-3 
in the SCIAC. But the Kingsmen are expecting the NCAA to rule their 
season-opening victory over Claremont-Mudd a forfeit because the Kingsmen used 
an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier dropped to 1-7, 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran took the lead early in the second quarter, when Dan Leffler made 
a 26-yard field goal. The Kingsmen scored on their next two possessions, with 
drives of 85 and 80 yards, both capped by Thomas touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The first touchdown drive was helped with an unusual reception by Thomas. 
Huisenga's pass hit Whittier's Peter Gomez and deflected backward, where Thomas 
plucked it out of the air for a 14-yard catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran scored on all three of its third-quarter possessions, taking a 
38-0 lead and spurring a parade of second-stringers in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran fullback Ivan Moreno left the game in the first quarter with a 
broken leg.

ANTELOPE VALLEY LOSES, 24-16, DESPITE FAST START AND FINISH

 The Antelope Valley College football team started fast and closed with a 
flurry, but the Marauders couldn't overcome a mid-game lapse that led to a 
24-16 loss Saturday to Mt. San Jacinto in a Foothill Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarod Dodson returned an interception 21 yards for a touchdown to give 
Antelope Valley a 7-0 lead 13 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the Marauders dug themselves a hole, yielding three touchdowns and a 
field goal before rallying again in the final six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley also scored nine points in the final six minutes, but fell to 
1-7, 1-5 in conference play. The Eagles improved to 6-2, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt Miller scored on a 27-yard screen pass from quarterback Michael 
Gleich, and Zoltan Matrai added a 20-yard field goal to close the gap to 24-16 
with just over two minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley recovered an onside kick and drove to midfield before Gleich 
threw an interception to end Antelope Valley's hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleich completed nine of 20 passes for 123 yards. Miller had 63 yards in 11 
carries and added another 89 yards with six receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley ran only four plays in the first quarter and didn't complete a 
pass in the first half.

GLENDALE'S DEFENSE GETS ROCKED WHILE OFFENSE ROLLS; JC FOOTBALL: VAQUEROS ROLL 
UP 427 YARDS BUT GIVE UP 540 IN SHOOTOUT LOSS TO SANTA BARBARA, 40-34. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Glendale College badly needed a victory Saturday to stay in the Western State 
Conference Northern Division football race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaquero offense rose to the challenge at Glendale High, rolling up 427 
yards and reaching the end zone five times. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense offered little opposition against Santa Barbara City's 
run-and-shoot passing attack, and the Vaqueros lost, 40-34. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara quarterback Jarrod DeGeorgia riddled Glendale for 317 yards on 
24 of 44 passing and also scrambled for two pivotal first downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt he was the best quarterback in our conference and one of the 
best in the state," Glendale Coach John Cicuto said of DeGeorgia, who passed 
for four touchdowns in the first half as Santa Barbara took a 33-14 lead into 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we're a better team against the pass than we showed today," Cicuto 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Saturday, Glendale had the third-best defense against the pass in the 
13-team WSC, yielding an average of 164 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 When DeGeorgia wasn't shredding the Glendale defense, he was handing off to 
Chad Marsalek, who gained 191 yards in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalek's 34-yard touchdown run on Santa Barbara's first possession set the 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara (4-4 overall, 4-3 in the conference and 2-1 in division play) 
scored at will, reaching the end zone on each of its first six possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara outgained Glendale, 540-427, and overshadowed a Glendale aerial 
assault almost as impressive as DeGeorgia's. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver Tim Hilton, a sophomore transfer from Cal Lutheran, caught 10 passes 
for 163 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless our team wins, it means nothing," said Hilton, whose two scoring 
receptions in the final seven minutes brought Glendale (4-4, 3-4, 1-2) back 
from a 40-20 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton's three-yard scoring reception from quarterback Tony Delgado was 
followed by teammate Ely Enriquez's recovery of an onside kick. Six plays 
later, Delgado found Hilton again, this time from 36 yards with 4 minutes 23 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara covered the next onside kick and, thanks to a key catch by 
Josiah Williams, ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's Delgado completed 22 of 33 passes for 255 yards, while running back 
Ilan Zilberman added 102 yards in 12 carries.

OAK TREE; CERIN ENJOYS HIS USUAL LUCK IN THE MORVICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though he wasn't represented at Churchill Downs, Vladimir Cerin had 
another memorable Breeders' Cup day. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in the last five years, the trainer won the $81,675 
Morvich Handicap, and it was an absolute breeze Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeating what Yes I'm Blue did in 1990, Rotsaluck outran his six rivals early 
and pulled away from them late. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks after winning his debut on Santa Anita's hillside turf course by 
seven lengths, the 3-year-old Rajab gelding rolled home by 6 1/2 under Fernando 
Valenzuela in the Morvich. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Dan Dennison for the first four starts of his career, Rotsaluck is 
much improved since joining Cerin's barn. The victory was his third in a row 
after he ran second and eighth in his first two races for Cerin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the horse has turned around," Cerin said. "I think this horse 
showed this kind of ability right from the start. Earlier in the year (Jan. 9) 
he was only beaten a length and a quarter by Soul Of The Matter (who was fourth 
in the Breeders' Cup Classic), and he wasn't the soundest horse in the world at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had knee surgery on both knees. But he's recovered and he's come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-1 third choice, Rotsaluck obviously has a fondness for Santa Anita's 
unique course, but Cerin said he might also supplement him to Hollywood Park's 
Turf Express on Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've got a (course) freak here," Valenzuela said. "I came away from 
there and found myself on the lead in front of some speed horse, going pretty 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, coming down the hill, my horse stumbled and went down all the way to 
the ground. I think he hit a soft spot in the turf. But I picked him back up 
and he just accelerated. I guess it's mostly the course with him. He sure seems 
to like going down the hill. He really accelerates on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In a race that included favored D'Hallevant and Winning Combo, it was 
surprising Rotsaluck made the lead so easily, but he opened up two lengths 
after a quarter of a mile. He went 21 1/5, 43 4/5 and 1:07 1/5 en route to the 
final time of 1:13 3/5 for about 6 1/2 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Hallevant, the 3-2 choice, finished second, a half-length in front of 7-1 
shot Didyme. Geographe was fourth, then came Winning Combo, Portoferraio and Mr 
Impose. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran a decent race," said Aaron Gryder, who was on the favorite. "The 
winner got away from him a little bit around the turn. I tried to stay with him 
and keep the pressure on as much as I could, but he just drew away from us. 
Just the same, my horse kept to his task and ran a solid race to hang on for 
second." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Corrazona, fourth as the heavy favorite in last month's Las Palmas, is the 5-2 
choice to make amends in the $400,000 Yellow Ribbon Stakes today. 
</P>
<P>
 Reunited with Gary Stevens, the 4-year-old El Gran Senor filly has lost her 
last two starts after winning her first three in this country. The Las Palmas 
was her initial loss on this turf course after previously winning an allowance 
race and the Santa Anita Budweiser Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Aube Indienne, who was 8-1 when she won the Las Palmas in her first start for 
trainer Charlie Whittingham, is the 7-2 second choice in the 1 1/4-mile Grade 
I. She will again be ridden by Kent Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 The Juddmonte Farms-owned entry of Wandesta and Yenda is next at 4-1, along 
with Magical Maiden, then comes Fondly Remembered (5-1), the entry of Zoonaqua 
and La Frontera (10-1), Freckling Shadows (20-1), and Chesa Plana and Wende 
(30-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Alywow, second in the recent Rothmans International, was supposed to run in 
the Yellow Ribbon, but trainer Roger Attfield decided against it at the last 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't breeze as well as I wanted," Attfield told Daily Racing Form. "I 
was worried about the turf course (at Santa Anita) and decided to abort the 
mission. She'll fly to California next week to prepare for the Matriarch (Nov. 
27 at Hollywood Park)." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 On-track attendance at Santa Anita was 22,671 and the total handle was 
$17,006,419. Total attendance was 51,451. . . . Four of the seven Breeders' Cup 
winners paid more locally than they did at Churchill Downs. Cherokee Run paid 
$8.80 ($7.60 in Kentucky), Flanders $3 (2.80), Timber Country $7.20 ($6.80) and 
Concern $26.40 ($17). The winners that paid less than in Kentucky were: One 
Dreamer $69.40 ($96.20 at Churchill Downs), Tikkanen $31.60 ($35.20) and 
Barathea $19.60 ($22.80). . . . A field of nine was entered in Oak Tree's 
closing-day feature, the $150,000 Carleton F. Burke Handicap at 1 1/4 miles on 
turf. Newton's Law, who has two victories at the meeting, Sir Mark Sykes, 
Savinio and the European import Frenchpark head the field. . . . Fernando 
Valenzuela and Chris Antley won twice Saturday. . . . Heavily favored Salta's 
Pride won the $50,000 Charles H. Russell Handicap over a sloppy track at Bay 
Meadows. Roberto Gonzalez rode the winner for trainer Pico Perdomo.

MARINERS SAIL TO SECOND VICTORY OVER UTAH, 5-2 
</P>

<P>
 The Ventura Mariners defeated the Utah Lightning, 5-2, Saturday night in the 
second contest of a three-game, Western States Hockey League series at the Easy 
Street Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners (6-1-1) used first-period goals by WSHL scoring leader Rico 
Fulgenzi, Ace Pascual and David Mischel to pull away from the Lightning 
(0-10-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura won the series opener, 9-6, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah stayed in the game on the 46-save performance of goalie Chad Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to keep the play wide and spread them out," said Mischel, who scored 
what proved to be the game-winning goal on a slap shot from the top of the left 
faceoff circle. "If we use our speed they can't grab us." 
</P>
<P>
 Mariner Coach Sean McGillivray agreed, saying Utah won many of the physical 
battles while playing a conservative game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were letting us get the puck in close and then jumping on us," he said. 
"They really cleared us out in front of the net." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners got third-period goals from Fulgenzi, who has 19 points this 
season, and Steve Petritz. Jordan Leithem had 11 saves.

 In a game marred by more than 250 yards in penalties, two player ejections and 
a postgame brawl that involved players and fans, visiting Bell-Jeff High 
emerged with a 27-7 victory over Cathedral in a Santa Fe League contest 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight broke out when the teams met to shake hands after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been bad blood between these two schools for years," said Bell-Jeff 
assistant Brett Woodlief, who was bleeding from the mouth after being hit 
during the melee. "I took two or three punches out there and I hate to say it, 
but I could see this coming from the beginning of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Szeptycki completed seven of 12 passes for 96 yards and a touchdown 
for Bell-Jeff (5-4, 4-2), which scored 20 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Star 27, St. Genevieve 0 -- Five St. Genevieve players were taken to the 
hospital because of injuries and the second half of the Santa Fe League game at 
Birmingham High was played with a running clock. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the injuries occurred during the second quarter. Quarterback Vince 
Pisano, who injured his shoulder, was taken to a local hospital by his parents, 
as was lineman Mike Hanson (neck). Running back Nelvine Ocampo (concussion), 
running back Ray Cruz (irregular heartbeat) and backup quarterback Rodney 
Villanueva (unspecified chest injury) were transported by ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian 31, Maranatha 0 -- Tony Yousif caught a touchdown pass and 
ran for another to lead the host Crusaders (6-3, 4-0) in an Alpha League game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignacio Brache kicked a 55-yard field goal. 
</P>

JAMES FLANIGAN: STOCK PICKERS CLIMB ON TECHNOLOGY'S BROAD BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You might never know it from the stock market's gyrations, but big money 
managers have turned decidedly bullish. 
</P>
<P>
 And the focus of their optimism is the field broadly known as technology. A 
poll in Barron's last week of 176 major pension fund managers said they see 
stock market averages scaling new heights next year. Their favorite stocks are 
Microsoft, Motorola, Intel and Cisco Systems, a small but rapidly growing San 
Jose company that has caught the fickle attentions of analysts and big 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 More than routine stock picking is at work. Technology is the engine of the 
U.S. economy and, increasingly, the world economy too. Therefore, optimism on 
technology indicates long-term bullishness on most industries, especially U.S. 
businesses. "A decade ago there were doubts, but now it's clear that U.S. 
companies dominate in technology, whether in computers, semiconductors, 
software or data networking," says Harry Lange, manager of Fidelity 
Investments' Select Technology fund and its Computer and Electronics funds. 
</P>
<P>
 That U.S. lead was achieved not by one company or a few, but by headlong 
competition that spawned thousands of companies now employing 2.4 million 
people in the United States alone. Technology is moving to be the world's 
largest employer as it grows to be the world's largest industry -- total sales 
will reach $800 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
 What that means is: If you want to know about good jobs and changing work 
patterns, you have to watch technology companies, because they set the tone 
today. And if you want gains in your investment accounts, you should have some 
of your money -- 20%, say experts -- in technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no picnic. After a 29.7% rise last year, Lange's Technology fund has an 
18% gain so far this year -- although in the first six months it had no gain at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Volatility can be frightening. Early this year, some analysts thought Cisco 
Systems' growth was slowing in the business of developing tools that allow 
computers to share information easily. Its stock fell from more than $40 a 
share to less than $20 between March and July, even as its business continued 
to grow at a rate of 50% a year. Cisco stock has since recovered more than half 
its loss, but investors who bought at $40 are still nursing wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 And so are employees, because at Cisco -- as at most technology companies -- 
the pay may be good, but the real attraction is stock ownership, with stock 
grants and options common among all ranks, from receptionists to executives. 
</P>
<P>
 At SynOptics Communications, for example, more than half the 1,700 employees 
are in the stock options program -- and many, therefore, are holding losses at 
the moment. In six years, SynOptics, of Santa Clara, Calif., grew from zero to 
$700 million in sales in the same business as Cisco. But then its growth 
stalled, due to fierce competition and customer confusion about the new 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 SynOptics stock, which had risen from $3 a share to $42 by mid-1993, fell all 
the way to $16 last month when the company merged with Wellfleet Communications 
to form Bay Networks. The new firm has a more rounded line of networking tools; 
its stock currently sells on Nasdaq for $27 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Such volatility makes the newest, fastest-growing industries seem no place for 
ordinary investors or employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet over five years -- a good, conservative investment horizon, notes 
Fidelity's Lange -- the highest returns are made in technology funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology stocks consistently rack up double the returns of the Standard & 
Poor's 500 index and other stock averages, says Michael Gianturco, whose firm, 
Princeton Portfolios, manages money for institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the risk is fundamental," says Gianturco, who has a book coming out next 
year titled "The Market That Beats The Market." "Companies fade; competition 
arises quickly and is very intense," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 350 software companies now, in a field where only a handful of names 
-- such as Microsoft, Lotus, Borland, Novell and Oracle -- are recognizable. 
Investors have to search out small companies with specialty products, or have a 
mutual fund manager do it for them. 
</P>
<P>
 But numerous companies and intense competition are signs of industrial 
strength, not weakness. "Many of these companies are growing 20% to 30% a 
year," notes Richard Shaffer, publisher of Technologic Computer Letter. 
Technology mutual funds are up more than 10% this year, according to Lipper 
Analytical Services.  
</P>
<P>
 One reason there are so many companies is that the computer-electronics 
industry often separates functions such as manufacturing and design; firms 
specialize in making a single tool or part of the process, such as microchips 
or circuit boards or display screens.  
</P>
<P>
 Cost pressures constantly force change. Last week, for example, Silicon 
Systems decided to move semiconductor wafer manufacturing from Tustin to its 
plant in Santa Cruz, where it has more up-to-date equipment. That means 150 
jobs, at $11 to $12 an hour, will be done up north. But 800 jobs in 
semiconductor design and development, as well as non-technical work, will stay 
at Tustin headquarters because of the proximity of skilled suppliers in Orange 
County and the availability of engineers -- who fetch $35,000 a year to start 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the seeming chaos, technology can be a long-lived business. Silicon 
Systems, owned since 1989 by TDK Corp. of Japan, is 22 years old; major names 
such as Hewlett-Packard, Motorola and Intel -- not to mention IBM -- have been 
around for decades. What is changing most today is that computing and 
electronics are transforming all other businesses, from securities trading to 
movie distribution -- and just beginning to do so in countries all over the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
 That spells big opportunities for U.S. companies, old and new. "We're 
booming," says Michael Moritz, a partner in Sequoia Capital, the venture 
capital firm that backed Cisco Systems, among many others. "There's plenty of 
venture money for start-up companies in data networking, semiconductors, 
client-server software and digital video," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But though it's a faster world, it hasn't changed that much for master 
investor James Stowers, the founder and chairman of Kansas City's Twentieth 
Century Mutual Funds company, who has written a book titled "Yes You Can 
Achieve Financial Independence." 
</P>
<P>
 As he has for 36 years, Stowers advises ordinary investors seeking to stay 
ahead of inflation to invest "in companies whose earnings and revenues are 
accelerating" -- which just about defines the technology companies that have 
made the big money managers bullish.

FOREIGN FIRMS WITH DEEP POCKETS TEST U.S. LABS; RESEARCH: SCIENCE NEEDS OPEN 
BORDERS, BUT CRITICS SAY OTHER COUNTRIES ARE ACQUIRING KEY KNOWLEDGE ON THE 
CHEAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Gerard Mourou, director of a big research laboratory at the University of 
Michigan, accepted $1 million in research funding from Japanese electronics 
giant Fujitsu Ltd., it seemed like a simple decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the money, key technologies under development at the university's 
Center for Ultrafast Optical Science would wither, and neither the U.S. 
government nor U.S. industry was offering any funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a lab researcher filed for a patent on one of the center's 
technologies and left to form his own company, the university was left in a 
quandary. Fujitsu had been promised exclusive rights to any inventions in 
exchange for its support. But now a U.S. firm was pledging to use the 
technology to create jobs in America. 
</P>
<P>
 This dilemma is becoming a common one in research institutions across the 
country. Taxpayer-supported universities and government laboratories -- many of 
which had grown dependent on Cold War defense research -- are starving for 
funds, and they are increasingly turning to foreign corporations for 
sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say these firms are getting valuable technology on the cheap and 
transferring it overseas and that American workers and taxpayers are getting 
the short end of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of taxpayer money spent at universities and laboratories," 
says Norman Kreisman, an adviser on international research at the Department of 
Energy, the agency which oversees national laboratories such as Lawrence 
Livermore Laboratory. "You have to ask whether there are situations where the 
taxpayer is subsidizing the export of his own job." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Erich Bloch, former director of the National Science Foundation and a 
frequent critic of the U.S. research establishment: "The U.S. taxpayer pays for 
the MITs and Stanfords of the world. The foreign companies just pay incremental 
costs. . . . They're paying 10 cents on the dollar for the research." 
</P>
<P>
 European drug companies have been among the most aggressive in mining 
America's rich trove of technology. Two years ago, for example, Swiss drug 
maker Sandoz agreed to pay La Jolla-based Scripps Research Institute $300 
million for first rights to patents coming out of the institute over a 10-year 
period. (Pressure from the National Institute of Health later forced Scripps to 
renegotiate some terms of the agreement.) 
</P>
<P>
 But because America's trade with Europe is largely balanced and Europe's top 
research institutions are accessible to American scientists, there has been 
little alarm about European access to U.S. research. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the concern centers on Japan, which has a large and growing trade 
surplus with the United States. Because Japanese research efforts are 
structured differently, with most important research taking place at private 
corporations, there is a sense of injustice among American companies. They 
don't have access to the leading-edge research in Japan in the same way 
Japanese companies do in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Many American researchers are also more concerned about Japan because of the 
comprehensiveness with which it has targeted every level of America's 
technology food chain -- from basic research to acquisitions of technology 
companies. There is fear that the Japanese will use American technology against 
American industry, just as they did in the television and semiconductor 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, do we get as much R&D from them as they get from us?" Bloch 
asks rhetorically. "No. We have to look at this as a business relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Few believe that American research universities should cut off foreign access 
to basic research. A free flow of information is critical if America is to 
maintain its strength in the basic sciences, and the country's research 
universities would be handicapped without access to talented foreign graduate 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 But cash-strapped universities are now focusing more of their efforts in areas 
with potential commercial applications. In fields such as biotechnology, 
scientific research is spawning commercial products much more quickly than in 
the past. That has raised new questions about exactly what constitutes the type 
of research that should remain accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-funded foreign corporations that think long-term may be in a better 
position to capitalize on basic research advances than American corporations, 
which are often fixated on quarterly profits. U.S. firms voice support for 
university research and complain about foreign access, but they often fail to 
underwrite their rhetoric with dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Craig Barrett, chief operating officer at Intel Corp., is a 
former Stanford University professor and a staunch supporter of the 
institution. "Our research universities are an incredibly valuable commodity," 
he says, warning that universities should resist focusing on research with two- 
or three-year targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Intel itself is negotiating with USC to fund a short-term research 
agreement on image and data compression. 
</P>
<P>
 And the universities' longtime sugar daddy, the federal government, simply 
doesn't spend the way it once did. Universities grew fat on federal research 
through much of the 1970s and '80s, with annual federal research spending 
reaching $20 billion a year by the late 1980s. Since then, the trend has 
reversed itself. Federal support for research has dropped by 7% since 1988, and 
there are twice as many scientists competing for those shrinking dollars than 
there were two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For many scientists, issues of competitiveness and job creation take a back 
seat to the simple thirst for dollars, which Japanese corporations stand ready 
to quench.  
</P>
<P>
 Japanese firms have developed elaborate networks of institutions to tap 
American research. There are about 195 Japanese corporate laboratories in the 
U.S., according to recent Commerce Department surveys, most located in key 
high-tech centers -- and most were established in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fanuc, a big Japanese robot company, has built a new lab in the Bay Area to 
develop sophisticated sensors that would give robots a sense of touch. The lab 
has a staff of just three, but it plans to plug into research on a core 
technology called force sensing that is under way at UC Berkeley's department 
of mechanical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been working on force sensing for many years," says Hadi Akeel, 
general manager for the Fanuc lab. "The technology has many applications, and 
we will work on the robotics" applications. Akeel expects a warm welcome. The 
company's close ties to the department are reflected in a generously endowed 
Fanuc professorship and an oak-paneled Fanuc meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese firms make good use of university industrial liaison programs, which 
gives them early access to research papers, regular updates on new research 
projects and welcome mats for corporate visitors -- all for fees of $50,000 a 
year or less. The companies have also developed a broad range of more elaborate 
and expensive relationships with universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say this access by Japanese companies comes much too cheap and easy. 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been frequently criticized for 
appearing overeager to accommodate Japanese researchers. And UC Irvine drew 
fire for a 40-year agreement allowing Hitachi Chemical Research to build a 
laboratory on campus in exchange for the university's use of part of the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiroshi Sumiyama, president of Hitachi's facility, says the company is 
primarily interested in developing a broad base of basic research for drug 
development rather than picking up commercial technology. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bloch, for one, is not satisfied with this explanation, maintaining that 
Japanese companies are paying peanuts to pick the brains of America's best 
scientists. "You are going to spend more time with the individual who 
contributes money to your program," says Bloch. "The taxpayer who paid for the 
lab for the past five years is out of mind. To the researcher, what is more 
important is who is paying for his research today." 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate Japan's stepped-up information-gathering efforts are a response to 
the nation's failure to foster quality in its own basic research institutions, 
Japanese and American researchers agree. Japanese university research is held 
back by dilapidated laboratories and tiny research budgets, and generally 
cannot attract top talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some areas, you are eight to 10 years ahead of us," says Takashi Kiuchi, 
director of the Cypress-based subsidiary of Mitsubishi Electric. The company's 
research facility in Cambridge hires some of nearby MIT's and Harvard's best 
graduates.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have the top minds of Hungary, Israel, France, India, China and Germany," 
says Kiuchi. "The ideas they bring in are fabulous. You can't imagine that kind 
of discussion in Japan. This diversity -- this is the source of U.S. 
creativity." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at home, insular Japanese corporations and universities are 
reluctant to tap foreign talent. "They don't want to pay the price (of ethnic 
diversity)," says Chalmers Johnson, president of the Japan Policy Research 
Institute. "The attitude is 'Let America absorb the foreigners and do the 
science, and we will buy the technology from them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some universities are trying to address concerns over foreign access by 
establishing tougher conditions. At UC San Francisco, officials are requiring 
foreign donors to pay for all direct and indirect costs of any research for 
which they are given patent rights. The university signed a $20-million, 
five-year deal last year with Daiichi Pharmaceuticals to establish a center to 
study atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, a cause of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Daiichi will get the first rights to negotiate for exclusive licenses to any 
drugs developed at the center and the right to delay publication of research 
while it decides whether or not to apply for a patent. 
</P>
<P>
 Without private money from companies such as Daiichi, says Karl Hittelman, 
associate academic vice chancellor at UCSF, "important work gets left undone."  
</P>
<P>
 Some advocate far stricter rules. Richard Samuels, a political science 
professor at MIT, suggests that universities should charge higher fees for 
foreign corporate employees who come to university labs for short stays, and 
then channel the money to graduate students born in the United States. Still, 
some observers argue that having American technology developed by Japanese 
companies and made available to Americans in the form of finished products ends 
up benefiting Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The crux of the problem, they say, lies not with Japanese acquisition of U.S. 
technology, but with the lack of a coherent American strategy to exploit the 
country's superior research establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. universities, laboratories and companies should figure out a way to be 
coupled together to maximize the flow of people and knowledge," says Praven 
Chaudhari, a scientist at IBM's Watson Research Center. "Otherwise, the 
knowledge is out there in the literature and available to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous programs designed to address this problem have been launched in 
recent years, with the Commerce, Energy and Defense departments each offering 
grants to corporations to work with universities in turning basic research into 
marketable products. These programs typically include provisions requiring 
participants to show that they will contribute to the U.S. economy through 
local manufacturing or other activities.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it will probably take a combination of stricter rules on foreign 
access to research and a greater sense of responsibility on the part of 
American universities and corporations to assure that Americans see the 
benefits of taxpayer-supported research. 
</P>
<P>
 At the University of Michigan, for example, the Center for Ultrafast Optical 
Science eventually granted the disputed patent to Picometrix, the firm 
co-founded by the center's American researcher. But the action was taken only 
after Picometrix's chief executive, Rob Risser, marshaled his extensive ties at 
the university to force the issue. (Fujitsu still received a non-exclusive 
patent and was allowed to transfer know-how from the center to its own labs.) 
</P>
<P>
 Risser is only partially mollified. "You have hundreds of millions of (tax) 
dollars spent on a technology, and it can all be transferred overseas in a 
couple of years," he says. "It's because faculty members will do anything for 
development and research dollars to run their labs." Japan's Stake in American 
Know-How 
</P>
<P>
 Japan maintains a huge trade deficit with the United States in the area of 
technology, as represented by the royalties companies in the two countries pay 
for using other firms' inventions and processes. Royalty payments, in billions 
of dollars: 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's payments to U.S.: $2.92 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. payments to Japan: $1.12

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: INSIGHT; NEW PRODUCTS SERVE AS SIGNPOSTS TO THE 
INFORMATION HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEWART ALSOP, Stewart Alsop, a long-time observer of the personal computer 
industry, is editor-in-chief of San Mateo-based InfoWorld magazine and the 
founder and publisher of P.C. Letter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I got that ISDN line I wrote about in my last column, the one that's supposed 
to provide really fast communication between my computer and other people's. My 
company's computer people tell me it works. It just doesn't do anything when I 
try to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm feeling really wired anyway. The information highway is bursting out 
all over -- just not in the ways that most of the media write about so 
glowingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider these recent events in my digital life: 
</P>
<P>
 * On Oct. 23, President Clinton came to speak at the high school up the road 
from my house. The headline in our weekly newspaper, the San Carlos Belmont 
Enquirer Bulletin, read, "White House Catches Up With SC on the Internet." 
</P>
<P>
 About six months before, San Carlos had put up its first "home page" on the 
World Wide Web -- an easy-access way to publish documents on the 'Net. The 
White House had just gotten up its own home page the week before the Clinton 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of the wonderful subtleties of the information highway: A town 
with 28,000 people and a full-time staff of 75 can provide a service before the 
White House can. What's the proper role of the federal government if the 
Internet allows for the kind of democracy in which economies of scale are a 
liability instead of an asset? 
</P>
<P>
 * The weekend the President came to town, I played with a new product called 
XBand from Catapult Entertainment. Catapult calls it a video game modem. XBand 
plugs into the Sega Genesis video game machine and the telephone line so you 
can play standard video games with other people over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 You call Catapult toll-free and have the supplier match you up automatically 
with another player who has the same game cartridge plugged into his or her 
machine. I played several games of NBA Jam, first with Spiff from San Mateo and 
then with Aminal from San Rafael. I clearly have earned my computer nickname, 
Nerd Man. But when my 9-year-old son, Stewart III, joined me on line, we gave 
Aminal a run for his money. (XBand is supposed to be available in stores later 
this month.) 
</P>
<P>
 * A few days later, I got my new version of America Online (Version 2.5), 
which is the hot on-line service these days. Loading the software on my 
computer, I noticed a new feature called TCP Connection -- something the people 
at the service haven't promoted. Using it means I can sign onto America Online 
through my company's Internet connection -- at speeds about 10 times as fast as 
with a fast modem, the devices most of us have been using to connect to on-line 
services for the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 When you start using commercial services at speeds like this, you see that you 
can do new and ever more interesting things. For instance, you can 
electronically browse through newspapers with real photographs and graphics or 
shop for products after studying high-resolution photographs and listening to a 
recorded explanation of the features of each model. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the last few weeks, I have been carrying a Sony Magic Link, a new device 
Sony calls a personal communicator. In reality it is a small, under-powered 
computer that processes a new kind of animated electronic mail (courtesy of 
AT&T's Personalink service) and provides an address book, calendar, calculator, 
checkbook and other personal management features. (It can also be used for 
remote control of a Sony TV or stereo system.) 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Link is not wireless; that technology is not ready for prime time. It's 
designed to plug into any phone line so you can collect and send mail 
toll-free. The screen is dim, there isn't enough storage, it's a little too 
big, it doesn't synchronize well with a personal computer and the software 
needs more work. But the device does what it's supposed to, and it's really 
engaging. Bottom line: I'm using it. 
</P>
<P>
 * I also got a new version (Version 5.0) of Quicken, the checkbook program 
from Intuit, the company Microsoft is in the process of buying for a mere $1.5 
billion. Now I can push a button called Quicken Quotes and the program will 
collect the current (15-minute delayed) prices of stocks, bonds and mutual 
funds I have listed and update the value of my portfolio automatically. I can 
then buy more shares by filling out an electronic check, which Quicken delivers 
to Checkfree Corp. for forwarding to my brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
 Intuit is working on something called Quicken Online, a service that will let 
Quicken users integrate checking and savings account information, brokerage 
activity and credit card accounts. In this way, you'll be able to manage all 
your personal finances in one place, plan for retirement, college and other 
things, produce and file tax returns electronically and buy or sell equities 
and other financial instruments. No wonder Microsoft was so interested in 
Intuit! 
</P>
<P>
 No, I don't have my ISDN line doing anything yet. But I certainly do feel 
wired. The problem, of course, is that few of these things actually work with 
one another -- yet. Sometime shortly after 2000, when they do -- and when my 
ISDN line or TV cable or satellite dish is the route for getting to them -- 
I'll be all the way up the on-ramp and cruising on the information highway.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: AS RATES RISE, SHORT-TERM BOND FUNDS BECKON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nine months of interest rate hikes, the yields from money market mutual 
funds are starting to look attractive again. But for investors who can accept a 
bit more risk, ultra-short-term bond funds may offer a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
 These vehicles boldly go where money funds can't: into government and 
corporate IOUs that come due more than 13 months down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission requires money market funds to keep 
their overall holdings very short-term to ensure that they remain conservative. 
The rationale here is simple: Debt instruments with lengthier maturities are 
more volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 Although money funds may own individual IOUs that are due in as many as 13 
months, they're required to keep their overall portfolio mix much closer to 
home. A money fund's average holdings may not exceed 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Practically speaking, however, a debt instrument maturing in 13 months or even 
two years isn't all that much riskier. And, to compensate for the added danger, 
short-term bond funds pay higher yields. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the SEC adopted these rules (in the early 1980s), they created a pocket 
of inefficiency right beyond where the money funds can invest," said Richard 
Strong, head of the $11-billion Strong Funds group of Milwaukee. "It's an area 
where there aren't many natural buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, short-term bond portfolios are paying about 6% on average, compared 
to about 4.5% for money funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The short-term bond funds also have the potential to generate modest capital 
gains (or losses), which the money portfolios don't. 
</P>
<P>
 But the SEC regulations explain only part of the yield differential between 
the two types of mutual funds. Another key factor is the investor's willingness 
to accept lower yields in return for the principal stability available on money 
funds, said Tad Rivelle, a manager of the Hotchkis & Wiley Low Duration and 
Short-Term Investment funds in Los Angeles. Principal loss is always a minor 
risk in short-term investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a reflection of the public's risk aversion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During periods when interest rates are being ratcheted up, money market funds 
offer the best protection. But most of the time, the short-term bond portfolios 
with their higher yields generate superior returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Which type of fund should you favor? That depends on your interest rate 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Rachwalski, a senior vice president who oversees 14 money market 
portfolios with $12 billion in assets for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, 
anticipates another wave of rate hikes. He predicts that money fund yields 
could top 6% by the end of next year and that 30-year Treasury bonds could be 
paying 9%, up from about 8% today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is in place for rates to go higher," Rachwalski said, citing U.S. 
economic strength, an export uptick, improving foreign economies and 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivelle predicts rates will continue rising, but more slowly and by smaller 
amounts than they have so far in 1994. Strong, too, believes the worst is over. 
Unless interest rates rise sharply from here, they say, the short-term bond 
funds will outperform their more conservative cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 When shopping for short-term bond funds, it's important to look at the "load," 
or sales commission, if any, as well as the fee for annual operating expenses. 
High loads and expenses eat into returns and are hard to justify considering 
the modest yields these investments pay out. 
</P>
<P>
 The most competitive short-term bond funds are commission-free and charge 0.5% 
or less for annual operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors seeking long-term growth wouldn't want to park too much money in 
short-term bond funds. These investments won't make you rich. All you can 
really hope is that they will stay two or three percentage points ahead of 
inflation each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that's better than what money market portfolios have historically 
delivered. And at yields of 6% or so, the short-term bond funds are starting to 
look good again. 
</P>

 Warburg Pincus Japan OTC, the first actively managed mutual fund to focus on 
smaller Japanese stocks, has garnered $20 million in assets in its first month 
of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller companies have long been overshadowed in Japan by the large, 
export-driven multinationals. But the smaller firms will enjoy better profits 
and investment performance with the yen at its recent high levels, predicted 
Shuhei Abe, the Tokyo-based manager of the Warburg Pincus fund ((800) 888-6878; 
no load). 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller Japanese companies tend to concentrate more on the domestic market 
than on exports, and a theme Abe likes here is discount retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies that challenge the inefficient pricing widespread in Japan will be 
big winners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abe predicts smaller stocks will outperform the blue chips for several years, 
helped by an expected rebound in Japan's economy. And such stocks are cheaper 
than shares in large firms.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: CALPERS HATCHES A BETTER PLAN FOR NEST 
EGGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In what may become a model for public employee pension plans everywhere, the 
California Public Employees Retirement System has started franchising a 
low-cost, high-tech supplemental retirement program to 800 agencies throughout 
the state.  
</P>
<P>
 The program, which could eventually serve about 600,000 public-sector workers, 
will give even the smallest mosquito abatement district the ability to offer a 
comprehensive retirement savings plan to its workers. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS appears to be on the cutting edge of a national trend aimed at getting 
retirement options for government workers up to speed with what's offered in 
the private sector. Several states, including Massachusetts, New York and 
Michigan, have already dramatically changed their supplemental retirement 
plans. Meanwhile, CalPERS has been fielding questions from interested state 
administrators all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased scrutiny of government retirement programs is being spurred both 
by apparent shortcomings in the current systems as well as a growing belief 
that retirement in the 2000s will be drastically different than today.  
</P>
<P>
 Individuals are living longer, and people are healthier and more active in 
their 70s and 80s than ever before, notes Martin B. Walton, manager of the 
deferred compensation program at CalPERS.  
</P>
<P>
 The upshot: Tomorrow's retirees will need far more money to finance their 
golden years than their parents and grandparents did. Or they will need to keep 
working.  
</P>
<P>
 "What our parents went through with respect to retirement is vastly different 
to what we will experience," adds Thomas Bieniek, senior vice president of 
Fidelity Investments Tax-Exempt Service Co. in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a relative basis, they got very generous Social Security payments. They 
frequently stayed with the same company for long periods, which provided them 
with nice company pensions. And they bought homes that have appreciated by 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. A lot of those things just don't apply to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 While these issues have been largely addressed in the private sector, where 
employers are often offering tax-deferred savings plans, called 401(k)s, the 
equivalent government savings plan -- so-called 457 programs -- are light-years 
behind.  
</P>
<P>
 In a 401(k) or 457 plan, workers save their own money to finance their 
retirement. Employers offer and administer the plans, giving workers several 
investment options. Employees then determine how much of their pay they want to 
save in the plan and what percentage should go into each investment option.  
</P>
<P>
 The employer deducts the appropriate amount from the worker's pretax earnings 
and sends out statements advising workers how well they've fared. The main 
benefits of these plans are that they are tax-favored and portable. If you 
leave your job, you take your retirement savings with you. 
</P>
<P>
 The public-sector 457 plan differs from 401(k) plans in a few important ways. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, 457 plans are considered the property of the employer -- the 
government department or division -- rather than the employee, until the worker 
quits or retires and claims the funds. In other words, the employer could 
confiscate employee 457 savings in a budget pinch. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major difference is that many 457 plans are more expensive, more 
complicated and less attractive than the 401(k) plans offered in the private 
sector. Generally speaking, the annual fees on 457 plans amount to more than 2% 
of each participant's savings each year, compared to roughly 1% in 
private-sector plans. Also, small cities, counties and special district workers 
are often given few investment choices -- if they get a 457 plan option at all. 
And employees of larger government agencies frequently are given so many 
choices -- sometimes more than 100 -- that making a choice is nearly 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 The CalPERS program addresses both of these problems in fairly clear fashion.  
</P>
<P>
 First, it puts 457 assets into a so-called rabbi trust. This trust prohibits 
government employers from seizing their worker's retirement savings in a budget 
squeeze. The only thing the rabbi trust does not protect against is bankruptcy 
of the government agency. In such cases, 457 assets would still be at risk. 
However, on a practical level, government agencies rarely go bankrupt -- in 
fact, some are legally prohibited from filing bankruptcy.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan also simplifies investment choices by offering just eight easily 
explained investment options -- funds that invest in stocks, bonds, money 
market accounts and insurance contracts. There's also a so-called asset 
allocation account, which is a smattering of all the other funds, allowing 
workers to easily diversify retirement assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the program comes with all the bells and whistles of a smoothly 
operated company plan -- next-day fund switching, a toll-free customer service 
line and detailed brochures that explain investing in general and each 
individual's specific investment choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the CalPERS plan will be offered to the employees of city, county 
and special districts all over the state. Roughly 600,000 employees could be 
eligible, about 150,000 of whom reside in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some experts believe that in the long run, the CalPERS changes will 
become an industry model and that public employees from here to Florida will 
benefit from segments of the program, which could make 457 plans safer, less 
expensive and easier to understand nationwide.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: INVESTING? BUY SOUND ADVICE FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q.Is it worth hiring a financial adviser if you don't have a lot of money to 
invest? And if it is worth it, how do you pick one? 
</P>
<P>
 B.U . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. It is always worth getting the best advice you can possibly afford -- and 
sometimes you can't afford not to get the best help available before making 
your first move into uncharted territory. After all, if you are successful, 
your small nest egg won't be small for long. 
</P>
<P>
 But before you rush off to consult a financial planner, take some time to 
understand the subject. This can help ensure that your questions are on target 
and that you understand the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelves of libraries and bookstores are jammed with books that describe 
how to build an investment portfolio. Many of these primers are quite good and 
worth reading before you embark on any investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Another initial step is to enroll in a course at a local junior college or 
university extension, both of which typically offer classes in personal finance 
and investing.  
</P>
<P>
 Once you are ready to consult a planner, you should realize that these 
advisers come with a variety of qualifications and methods of conducting 
business. Basically, anyone can claim to be a financial planner, so the 
consumer must be careful. Finding a good planner who understands your goals and 
investing temperament can be difficult, but it is not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 As with choosing any professional, the best recommendations often come from 
friends or relatives who can share their experiences and advice. The family 
lawyer and accountant are also important referral sources. Ask these 
professionals whom they use for their own financial planning and to whom they 
refer their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some questions to ask planners you are considering hiring: How long 
have you been in this business? How have you prepared for this job? What job 
did you have before becoming a financial planner?  
</P>
<P>
 You might also ask the planners to give you the names of some other clients. 
Of course, they are not intentionally going to pass on the names of 
dissatisfied people, but you can learn a lot from clients who profess to be 
pleased with the services they receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some sample questions: Would you select this planner again? What are 
his or her strengths and weaknesses? Are you faithfully following the advice 
given? What would you do differently if you had a chance to do it all over 
again? How has the planner's advice made a difference in your financial 
affairs? 
</P>
<P>
 County courthouse records are another source you should check before hiring a 
planner. Search the criminal and civil filings for the names of the people you 
are considering, to make sure they haven't been sued by a disgruntled client 
or, worse, charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Also ask to see copies of the disclosure forms the planner files with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. Anyone selling registered securities and 
giving or selling investment advice must file an ADV Part II with the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, a planner who advises you to buy investments that pay him a 
commission has a built-in bias toward such investments. Many so-called 
financial planners are little more than salespeople who steer you exclusively 
to products of their company. You are not told about the full range of choices 
available -- only those that would get the representative a commission. 
Typically, you don't pay for the services directly; rather, the planners are 
compensated by the commissions they receive on the products they sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisers who charge a flat fee generally do not stand to benefit from 
recommending one course of action over another; however, their advice doesn't 
come cheap. According to one study last year, the median price nationwide of a 
short-term financial plan was $300, while the median price of a comprehensive, 
long-term plan was $950. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a fee-only adviser may not be able to help a client carry out his 
or her recommendations. Clients may face additional fees for stockbrokers or 
insurance agents or others who must be consulted in order to execute the 
planner's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine that recommendations are not given merely to generate 
commissions, ask the planner to disclose how much money he or she would make if 
you followed the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 If you need help finding a fee-only financial planner, the National Assn. of 
Personal Financial Advisers in Buffalo Grove, Ill., can provide its members' 
names and addresses. Call the group at (800) 366-2732 and leave your name and 
address on the automated response line. 
</P>
<P>
 You will be sent a list of the names of NAPFA members working in your area. In 
addition, members working near you will be notified of your interest and may 
contact you directly to follow up on your inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also find a fee-only financial adviser through the Licensed 
Independent Network of CPA Financial Planners. Call (800) 737-2727. Leave your 
name and address, and an association member in your area will contact you. Real 
Estate: Are We in the Basement Yet? 
</P>
<P>
 Q. There are so many repossessed homes for sale in Southern California these 
days, and with interest rates rising, I am wondering if this is going to get 
worse. * 
</P>
<P>
 F.M . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. The most recent economic news out of Southern California has been somewhat 
encouraging, leading many to conclude that we have hit bottom and are slowly 
improving. However, there are still layoffs coming in the defense industry in 
Los Angeles and Orange counties. These could hit some neighborhoods quite hard, 
causing a spate of price-depressing sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, experienced and savvy real estate buyers may find that 
today's market offers many potentially great deals that could be scooped up 
before interest rates jump again.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; A DOCTOR'S ORDER; IN THE WORLD OF PUBLIC MEDICINE, WHERE 
SUPPLY NEVER MEETS DEMAND, IT'S ONE CRISIS AFTER ANOTHER. DR. SOL BERNSTEIN HAS 
SPENT HIS LIFE MANAGING THE CHAOS AT COUNTY-USC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA WARRICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people enter Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center through the emergency 
room. Gang-bangers riddled with bullets. Mutilated accident victims. Cyanotic 
drug addicts. Destitute women ready to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 But young Sol Bernstein, fresh-faced and unscathed, came in through the front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1956, and the experience stopped the first-year medical student in his 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like entering a cathedral. On the ceiling (were) those stunning 
gold-leaf murals of Aristotle, Hippocrates and Aesculapius, father of medicine. 
And directly over the entrance, her wings outstretched, stood the Angel of 
Mercy. . . . I was completely in awe." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein can't count the number of times that he has since paused beneath the 
stone angel, but every time, he says, is inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in Sol Bernstein's world of public medicine, one can always use 
inspiration. Wards are overcrowded, staffs are overworked, budgets are 
overdrawn. There is never a surplus of anything, it seems, except patients.  
</P>
<P>
 Nurses strike, doctors walk out, earthquakes crack the buildings -- and still 
the sick people come. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he retired this past summer, Bernstein was the one person who could make 
sense out of the crises and the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 As an intern, a resident, a professor and, for the last two decades, chief of 
the medical staff, the erudite cardiologist has been a steady hand in turbulent 
times for Southern California's last-resort, deficit-plagued institution.  
</P>
<P>
 "More than any other single man, perhaps, Sol Bernstein has been the soul of 
this place," says longtime associate Harvey Kern.  
</P>
<P>
 And, others say, its guts as well. 
</P>
<P>
 That he would choose a career of fighting for public dollars, public respect 
and public sympathy for the county's sickest poor suggests that Bernstein was 
as much inspired by Hercules as by the Angel of Mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a dark Monday in early February, 1993, Damascio Ybarra Torres, 40, reached 
the end of his rope. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacing through a crowd of more than 100 ailing people lined up outside the 
county hospital emergency room, Torres pulled out a semiautomatic pistol and 
opened fire. Three doctors were hit -- one point-blank in the head. As the 
victims were pulled to safety, Torres grabbed two hostages and held them for 
five hours behind an X-ray machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's their turn to wait," Torres told SWAT team negotiators. "They made me 
wait. Now they can wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Although horrified by the rampage, which ended in the gunman's arrest, 
Bernstein understood. 
</P>
<P>
 Long waits of four to 14 hours had become a fact of life here, the nation's 
busiest emergency room. "For the great majority of people, the ER is the front 
door of this hospital. They may have to wait many, many hours," Bernstein says. 
"And when people have to wait, sometimes people get angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say it was a turning point for a hospital that had always been open to 
all comers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No longer could we assume that we were a sanctuary -- a place where people 
came to be healed. The violence changed all that. We were fair game, like 
churches, like schools, like the rest of society," Bernstein recalls. "It was 
very sad when it came to this. Very, very sad." 
</P>
<P>
 But the history of violence at the county medical complex had begun long 
before Torres walked into the ER that afternoon, yelling for pain medication. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, one of the many panhandlers who once routinely roamed the corridors 
stabbed a nurse in the neck with a pair of scissors.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, an 18-year-old gang member was shot in the face during a melee 
involving 20 youths who were visiting patients. And back in 1984, a patient was 
shot to death by a security guard after he allegedly reached up from his 
gurney, grabbed another guard's gun and fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "With every act of violence in that hospital, Sol and a few other really 
caring and sensitive people were personally wounded," recalls one retired 
county physician. "It wasn't the way we had viewed our relationship with our 
patients. Suddenly, we were forced to look at some of them in a different way. 
Almost against our will, we had to be wary, we had to be on guard." 
</P>
<P>
 That may explain why a year before the Torres shooting, Bernstein and his 
hospital staff had asked the county Board of Supervisors for 143 additional 
security guards. Their request was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I was shocked by what happened later in the ER, I cannot say I was 
surprised," Bernstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomat that he is, Bernstein never said, "I told you so." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "From the time he was a little boy, Sol wanted to help other people, he knew 
instinctively he wanted to be a doctor," recalls his older sister, Gertrude 
Zelenitz. "But unlike other little boys' wishes, you had absolutely no doubt 
that this boy would be what he said he'd be. It's as if he were born for this 
very purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, Bernstein spent many an afternoon in public libraries in New York 
City or his sleepy hometown of West New York, N.J. Hour upon hour, he would sit 
in the company of the Greek philosophers or Louis Pasteur and Albert 
Schweitzer.  
</P>
<P>
 His only real-life medical model was the Bernstein family doctor, who lived a 
block and a half away and who saw as many patients in their homes as he did in 
his modest office.  
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein's father was an auto dealer and his mother an artist and homemaker. 
She spent every Saturday of the Depression delivering baskets of food and 
clothing to less-fortunate relatives in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sol was 13, she died suddenly. He was devastated, his sister says. "Sol 
had always said he would take care of her when he grew up. Her early death was 
something we never really recovered from." 
</P>
<P>
 The young Bernstein, who had been bar mitzvahed in the neighborhood temple, 
gave up on his religion. His dream of becoming a doctor was never shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 After a stint with the Army's occupation forces in postwar Japan, Bernstein 
entered USC and four years later became the first in his family to earn a 
college degree.  
</P>
<P>
 Medicine was changing fast in the mid-1950s when Bernstein arrived to begin 
his medical training at General Hospital, the flagship of the county's massive 
hospital system. (Many know its imposing facade as the exterior set for the 
daytime soap opera of the same name.) 
</P>
<P>
 Polio had been nearly wiped out by Jonas Salk's new vaccine. Thanks to 
advances in antibiotic therapy, wards of tuberculosis patients were emptying. 
One of the nation's largest leprosariums was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 But inside "the Rock," as the great white stone structure is affectionately 
known, the practice of medicine was still a desperate business. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no intensive-care units, few elevators, and many patients from 
prison or psychiatric wards were manacled to their beds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a dark and noisy place," recalls Bernstein, 67. "The floors were a 
dreary brown linoleum and the walls were that nauseating green color. The care 
was the best that could be had, but the surroundings left much to be desired." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bernstein graduated from medical school, his father shipped him a record 
player as a gift. And that record player quickly became the property of the 
hospital -- or more accurately, the patients.  
</P>
<P>
 "I used to bring it to whatever ward I was on. I'd bring in the record player 
and play the music for an hour or two for each patient -- classical and show 
tunes, mostly. We did this to fight what we called the institutional 
depression," Bernstein says. "In those days, patients stayed in the hospital 
for a very long time. I got the feeling that it was not just the body we should 
be trying to treat but (also) their emotional well-being, their sense of 
person."  
</P>
<P>
 Until such programs as Medi-Cal and Medicare began underwriting the care of 
the uninsured, only public hospitals would take them in. For County-USC that 
meant finding room every night for as many as 3,300 patients. They lived 10 or 
11 to a room. One bathroom for 30 patients, a single shower shared by 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many of the patients were elderly, with no resources, their families 
unable or unwilling to care for them. Their gurneys or mattresses lined the 
corridors because there were simply not enough rooms for them all," Bernstein 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the wards, you'd have beds against this wall, beds against that wall, and 
then beds in the middle of the room. We would literally have to crawl over 
people in their beds to get to the next patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, Bernstein gave up his hands-on cardiology practice and the 
heart-surgery research that had earned him a national reputation. As he moved 
into the ranks of the administration, he saw his beloved hospital grow into a 
high-tech medical center with a vast complex of specialized facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Women's Hospital, for many years the birthplace of one in every 200 
babies in the nation, as well as Children's Hospital, Psychiatric Hospital, a 
nursing school and busy research centers spread across a 72-acre campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Bernstein found himself juggling the demands of the patients with 
the demands of their caregivers. Nurses wanted more money and more supplies. 
Residents and interns wanted more help -- and toilet seats for the patients' 
toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sol always did what he could to get the patients what they needed. I don't 
know how he did it since there was never enough money from the county, but he 
would work his magic and things would get better -- until the next crisis," 
says Dr. Joe Lindenbaum, a pediatrician who trained and worked with Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 To give the medical center's 900 interns and residents "someplace to go in the 
middle of the night for guidance," Bernstein created County-USC's first 
hospital ethics committee. "The house staff needed to think about issues beyond 
just prescribing and diagnosing," he says. "They had to begin weighing other 
'quality of life' considerations such as how the family feels, how informed is 
a patient's consent when he's worried, in pain or heavily medicated?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein's own ethics are liberal. His motto: "The patient always comes 
first." And, according to his colleagues, Bernstein stood by that credo even 
when county budget cuts and hiring freezes threatened to dictate medical values 
and patient-care decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sol always stood for the right thing. No matter what the pressures," recalls 
former county health services director Dr. Liston Witherill. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bernstein assumed the chief of staff's job in 1974, the medical center 
was a firecracker with a very short fuse. "It was a time," according to an 
understated USC history of the medical center, "marked by harassment (by) 
certain county supervisors as well as great activism by interns and residents." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Bernstein handled (these) situations with tact and finesse," reports the 
hospital's historian, Dr. Helen Eastman Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, say such colleagues as former director Paul Drozd, "Sol stayed 
calm, took the time to listen to all sides in every dispute, and worked darn 
near every night and day for 20 years to keep the place from exploding." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a saying among people who know about such things and who can afford 
anything: 'Take me to (County Hospital) if I'm ever in a serious accident or am 
on the brink of death because of an acute condition. But Lord deliver me from 
the place if I have a lingering illness."  
</P>
<P>
 Although the venerable former Times science writer Harry Nelson first let the 
world in on that secret back in 1965, there is little question that his words 
still apply. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to amenities -- frills like air conditioning and fancy art on 
the walls -- and even when it comes to such basics as piped-in oxygen and 
modern fire-detection systems, the County-USC complex cannot compete with newer 
and better-funded private hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to emergency care, County, as they say, is the place to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of them are very sick and very poor, patients here get the 
constant attention of the USC medical school and faculty -- and, until 
recently, of Bernstein as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that I was jealous at times of the hospital and of the 
patients," recalls Bernstein's son, Paul, a 27-year-old artist and musician. 
"But having a father like him is such a gift, such an incredible blessing, that 
I always got over it. His capacity for love is enormous." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Marcus Welby with a high IQ, Bernstein has been a mentor to students who 
want to learn not just how to practice medicine but how to find the joy in it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever someone tells me about a particular diagnosis or surgery or 
treatment where someone who otherwise would have died is saved, I am 
exhilarated. We all are!" Bernstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a little boy a few years back, for example, whose father got angry at 
him and cut off his penis and flushed it down the toilet. Someone was able to 
retrieve it and we were able to reattach it and make it fully functional. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hundreds of stories like this, thousands of them. Children horribly 
burned. Older people abandoned and tragically left with us to die. These young 
people brought in off the streets with bullet wounds, knife wounds. . . . When 
we are able to do something to help somebody, it makes all the difference. Not 
only for them, but for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, Suzi Bernstein died after a brief illness at age 54 in a 
room at University Hospital, across the street from her husband's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein was with his wife when a blood clot floated into her lung, killing 
her instantly. "It was totally unexpected and unspeakably tragic," says 
longtime friend Kern. "Everything changed overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzi owned a travel agency, and the prospect of taking trips together had 
finally lured Bernstein toward retirement. They had met 30 years earlier -- in 
the hospital, where else? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some friends were trying to fix us up, and they explained that I never left 
the hospital so she'd better come over here if she wanted to meet me. So she 
began volunteering and four months later, we were married," Bernstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until Suzi, I don't believe I ever took a vacation in all the time I had been 
a doctor. She truly introduced me to the world -- Moscow, Cairo, everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein still hopes to travel, but plans are on hold while he completes a 
series of consulting assignments for the county hospital system.  
</P>
<P>
 Although public medicine may be more sophisticated than it was back in 1956, 
it is no less volatile. And Bernstein and others nearing retirement worry that 
their breed of doctor-to-the-poor may be a dying one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not too long ago, I spent a little time in a rather well-to-do private 
hospital. I was sitting there in the doctors' lounge and listening to the 
conversations about the investments they'd made, the yachts they'd bought, the 
Cadillacs they'd ordered. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "And then I came back here to County Hospital to see the doctors in the dining 
room talking about their cases. How fascinated they were, how rewarded by the 
very practice of medicine here with patients who have nowhere else to go.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was their excitement. And it was mine." Dr. Sol Bernstein 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: No. Born and raised just across the Hudson River from Manhattan in 
West New York, N.J. Lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Widowed. One son, Paul, 27, an artist and musician who lives in 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Art and music, especially folk music; an overachieving Siamese cat 
named J. Robert Oppenheimer; Michael Crichton novels and anything about 
archeology, and TV's "Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 On the rewards of working at a hospital for the poor: "The patients here are 
so grateful. People who have very little themselves appreciate things more." 
</P>
<P>
 On the good old days: "In the old days, there was no need for bulletproof 
walls and uniformed guards and hidden cameras. There was no need for security. 
It was a hospital. " 
</P>
<P>
 On health-care reform: "Public hospitals like County are the no-frills 
airlines of hospital care. The doctors here have no grandiose plans for the 
mansion or the boat or the second home. Health-care reform? This is it. We've 
always had to get the most from every dollar."

HOME'S A REAL BEACH; LIFESTYLES: IT SEEMS NOTHING CAN SHAKE THE PASSION 
CALIFORNIANS HAVE FOR OCEANFRONT HOUSES. ELIZABETH MCMILLIAN'S NEW BOOK OFFERS 
A COLORFUL GLIMPSE OF PROPERTIES BY THE WATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing, it seems, can cool Southern Californians' passion for beach houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Not breathtaking prices, not exorbitant insurance premiums. Not eroding 
shorelines, not burning hillsides. Not environmental zoning laws, not 
complicated building permits. Not coastal traffic jams, not cocoa-buttered 
crowds outside the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not rational. There is just that intangible something that makes you 
think you have to get a beach house. There's something psychological about it, 
about seeing that expansiveness of the ocean, instead of being locked into the 
land," explained Elizabeth McMillian, an architectural historian and 
beach-house aficionado. 
</P>
<P>
 That magnificent -- and sometimes not so magnificent -- obsession is 
abundantly displayed in McMillian's new book, "Beach Houses From Malibu to 
Laguna" (Rizzoli International). With lush photographs by Melba Levick, the 
volume offers satisfying or envious glimpses behind all those brick walls and 
garage doors along Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 As its $50 price tag might suggest, "Beach Houses" does not go slumming. About 
the closest it comes to beach-shack funky is a lovely 1920s shingled cottage in 
Orange County's Crystal Cove, north of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The other 23 houses include an elegant, ultra-white Cubist affair designed by 
architect superstar Richard Meier in Malibu; a Santa Fe-style eco-retreat, also 
in Malibu, built by singer Olivia Newton-John and her actor-husband, Matt 
Lattanzi, with nontoxic materials and recycled lumber; a traditional 
Craftsman-style building in Hermosa Beach that exudes stability, and a faux 
French chateau in South Laguna that seems to utter the final word on 1980s 
excess, down to a staircase taken from a 19th-Century mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 No dumps, to be sure. And if the architecture and the interior design offend, 
just obsess on the beckoning ocean views, the rugged cliffs, the perfect 
gardens. If the million-dollar-plus price tags induce vertigo, imagine marring 
the pristine white floors and upholstery with proletarian beach mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't hold a grudge against McMillian. She lives in a high-rise 
condominium on Downtown's Bunker Hill, much closer to the concrete Los Angeles 
River than to the blue Pacific. She once shared a Santa Monica beach house for 
a few years in the '80s, but now counts herself among the many wanna-be 
beach-house owners. 
</P>
<P>
 McMillian, who has a doctorate in art history from USC, worked as the 
architecture editor at the imperious Architectural Digest for a decade and has 
been a landmarks commissioner in Santa Monica and president of the Society of 
Architectural Historians/Southern California chapter. Under that group's 
sponsorship, she recently finished a five-city lecture tour on beach houses. A 
recent session at the Los Angeles Central Library attracted about 60 people, an 
excellent turnout for a warm Sunday afternoon when many might rather visit the 
beach than watch slides of it in a darkened auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want people to see a documentation of some of the really exciting 
images along the beach," McMillian, a stylish woman with hints of a hometown 
Houston accent, said after her presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to show the variety. I'm not going to judge and say this or that is a 
better style. I want people to come away with an idea of some of the 
exceptional, maybe eccentric things that are characteristic of beachside 
settings." 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors make beach-house design a challenge: The often narrow building 
lots, code requirements for bulwarks, construction materials that can stand up 
to the elements and a desire to harness sunlight and breezes. And Southern 
California beach culture long has encouraged experimentation and downright 
weirdness that might not play in Pasadena or Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the introduction to McMillian's book, architect Frank Gehry explains that 
"the beach inspires dreaming, dreamers, and artists, and it seems to engender 
the free creative spirit." He also suggests that a threatened environment 
almost encourages artistic risks. Recalling his move to Los Angeles from Canada 
in 1947, he writes: "I was taken by the fact that, despite storms, mudslides, 
and fires, many Californians took risks and dared convention to live near the 
ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Those dares to nature -- and to savings accounts -- continue unabated, reports 
Meg Vaughn, a staff analyst for the California Coastal Commission, the agency 
that issues construction permits for beach houses. "To many people, certain 
benefits (of beach living) seem so attractive that they outweigh the 
negatives," she said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The energetic, multicolored house that Gehry designed for Lyn and Bill Norton 
on Venice Beach in 1984 is a prime example of unconventionality that borrows 
from location; its signature feature is a front study humorously shaped like a 
lifeguard stand. Another example is the concrete and curvy Byer residence in 
Malibu that architect John Lautner created in 1983 to mimic nearby hills, even 
placing river boulders indoors as constant reminders of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Another interesting approach is a Corona del Mar home designed in 1988 by Bart 
Prince. It "seems like something grown rather than constructed," according to 
McMillian. From one perspective, its undulating roof of wooden shingles 
resembles a giant mushroom about to devour home and inhabitants. Yet from the 
garden courtyard, it has the elegance of a modern Japanese temple draped in 
rich woods. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Doumani residence on Venice's Ocean Front Walk is a 
black-and-white townhouse that looks like a giant piece of cerebral sculpture. 
Designed by sculptor Robert Graham, it has a massive beachside window that 
rises over the heads of Rollerbladers. Geometric grillwork drawn by Billy Al 
Bengston defines the property line. McMillian calls the house "an exceptional 
monument to architectural integrity and classic repose in a neighborhood not 
particularly known for either." 
</P>
<P>
 She also encountered many awful houses during her research. "There's just no 
accounting for money and taste," McMillian says with a sigh. "They just don't 
always go together. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly upsetting, she says, are the single-family boxes, resembling 
soul-less apartment buildings, that continue to spring up along the South Bay 
and on the Laguna-area hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their setting, beach houses have "a kind of social responsibility 
to look good," the author proposes, "more than on some little wooded hillside 
where you hide yourself up some driveway."

HOT PROPERTY: STARS FALL FOR HOME IN HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GENIE FRANCIS, best known as Laura on the daytime soap opera "General 
Hospital," and her husband, JONATHAN FRAKES, who plays Commander William Riker 
on the hit syndicated science-fiction series "Star Trek: The Next Generation," 
have purchased a Beverly Hills-area home built a couple of years ago by actress 
Jane Seymour and her then-husband David Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis, 32, joined ABC's "General Hospital" when she was 14. She went on to 
become half of the soap's Luke and Laura team, TV's most talked-about romance 
of the early 1980s. The couple's TV wedding in 1981 remains the highest-rated 
soap event ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Francis and Tony Geary, who plays Luke, left the soap about 10 years ago 
and rejoined it as the older Luke and Laura in October, 1993. During the 
interim, Francis appeared in the soap "All My Children," the miniseries "North 
and South" (Books I and II) and the series "Bare Essence." 
</P>
<P>
 She also married Frakes, who co-starred in "Bare Essence" and the first two 
books of "North and South" plus this year's "John Jakes' Heaven and Hell: North 
and South, Part III." Frakes played Commander Riker, Captain Picard's No. 1 
man, on the sci-fi smash since 1987 and directed the second part of the 
two-part opening episode of this season's "Deep Space 9." 
</P>
<P>
 The home that Francis and Frakes bought is a 10,000-square-foot, Georgian 
Colonial on slightly more than an acre. The brick estate has five bedrooms plus 
two maids' quarters, a gym, screening room, two-story entry, pool and cabana 
with changing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The house was one of a number that Seymour and Flynn developed during the 
1980s and early 1990s. Overseen by Flynn, whom Seymour later divorced, the 
newly built or renovated homes were designed for the pair, but most were sold 
at a profit before they moved in, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The house that Francis and Frakes bought was in foreclosure. Flynn and Seymour 
paid $2.3 million for the property in 1990, but the home they built there was 
sold to Francis and Frakes for close to its last asking price of $1.6 million. 
The bank that held the first trust deed, valued at just under $3 million, was 
the seller. 
</P>
<P>
 The house still has some work to be done but is almost completed, sources say. 
Francis and Frakes had been living in a small house in the Hollywood Hills. 
"This was quite a move up for them," a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Ostrom and Carl Romeo of Jon Douglas Co., Sunset Strip, represented 
Francis and Frakes in buying the home, and Larry Bobshow of White House 
Properties, Encino, represented the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 GLEN LARSON, writer and executive producer of last summer's replacement series 
"One West Waikiki" (starring Cheryl Ladd as a medical examiner), has sold his 
Holmby Hills home for slightly more than $6 million, including some 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson, 56, was one of the Four Preps singing group during the 1950s who went 
on to become a gold record-winning songwriter ("26 Miles"), producer and 
director ("McCloud," "The Six Million Dollar Man") and co-writer of TV series 
("It Takes a Thief," "Simon and Simon," "The Road Raiders"). 
</P>
<P>
 He sold his home of nine years because he moved to a rental while building a 
home for himself and his wife. "His kids grew up, and his house was too big for 
him," a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, originally on the market in 1989 at $18 million but was most 
recently listed at $7.9 million, has six bedrooms, a two-lane bowling alley, 
recording studio and projection room, all in about 23,000 square feet. Built in 
1926, the house was completely remodeled in recent years. The 1.2-acre grounds 
also have a pool and tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 A manufacturer of art graphics and his wife bought the home. They have two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Risko and Kurt Rappaport of Fred Sands Estates, Beverly Hills, 
represented the buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 A 600-acre Santa Barbara-area ranch that has been owned by the same family 
since 1882 has come on the market at $7.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated along the coast, on the borders of Santa Barbara and Ventura 
counties, the Rincon Del Mar Ranch, owned by descendants of Dr. C. W. Bates and 
originally part of a 7,000-acre Mexican land grant, will be sold as part of a 
court order to settle a dispute among Bates' heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 20 different owners who want to go their separate ways," said Eldon 
D. Shiffman of Santa Ynez, the consultant facilitating the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 A few acres of the ranch have been sold off over the years, including the site 
now known as Rincon Point, a community of beachfront homes where Kevin Costner 
owns a residence, sources say. However, most of the ranch has remained intact, 
with the Bates family farming it since the early 1880s.

SPEAKING OUT: TAKE A WALK TO FIND NEIGHBORHOOD'S SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN WESTERBERG REYES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a ritual that had to be performed as soon as possible when we moved 
into another house -- I had to walk around the block. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only way I could get a bead on yet another new neighborhood; the 
only way I could reconcile myself to once again going through the painful 
process of finding new friends, new vacant lots and other areas of interest for 
a new kid on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only way I could get the feel, read the soul of the place where I 
would be living for another year, maybe two, if I was lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 My Daddy used to tell me that Mama had a case of the wanders. It had something 
to do with the fact that she lived in a rattrap of an old house in Kentucky for 
the first 23 years of her life. She hated that house, which was located as far 
on the wrong side of the tracks as you could get. It was a constant 
embarrassment of place, circumstance of birth and delegation of class, the 
negative effects of which she lives with to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 The outbreak of World War II and the many jobs available to women during that 
time were her ticket out of there. She met my father during her sweep through 
Denver (after stints in Connellsville, Penn., and Baltimore, Md.). 
</P>
<P>
 But even he couldn't keep her in one place for very long. We never stayed in 
any one area more than three or four years, and within that period we never 
stayed in any one house more than a year. And that's why I developed my ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 It was amazing what I could find out just by walking around the block, which I 
always did as soon as I could sneak away from the hubbub of movers and my 
mother's frantic cleaning of every surface before things could be put away. 
</P>
<P>
 I searched for a front yard filled with the paraphernalia of children: bikes 
(not tricycles or anything that had training wheels on it -- too young), balls, 
skates and, maybe, bonus of bonuses, a tree swing. 
</P>
<P>
 These were the surest indications that children lived there. And back then, 
bicycles also bespoke the genders of their owners, so I could report back to 
brother Evan an almost exact count of boys in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 And if I was lucky, or the neighborhood was especially child intense, I would 
get to actually meet one or two of my prospective new friends, who would be 
drawn out of their houses by that wonderful kid radar that goes off when a new 
youngster walks down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 We'd stare at each other clumsily. If I liked the looks of them I'd say, "Hi." 
But usually, I'd just walk by slowly trying to track their friendliness 
quotient in the index of their eyes. In the best of cases someone would come up 
to me and start asking questions, a sure sign of an impending friendship. 
Several times I got chased home. Once, one extremely unfriendly boy came out 
and threw dirt clods at me. 
</P>
<P>
 In the best of scenarios I would come upon a collection of neighborhood 
youngsters in the middle of a game: baseball, hide-and-seek, hopscotch or 
marbles. This was the best way to check out the group, since representative 
kids from other blocks might also be present. (A block was the core area of 
measurement in my young world because I could move within its confines without 
crossing a street -- something I was forbidden to do by myself until I was 
almost 10.) 
</P>
<P>
 My ritual hardly ever failed to produce results. Shortly after my initial 
block trip a cluster of neighborhood kids would just happen to come walking by 
my house. If I wasn't outside, they would just happen to make a lot of noise. 
I'd yell for my brother and we'd race to the door, stop, gather our nonchalance 
about us, and then amble out and slouch into the two big Adirondack chairs that 
always sat on the front porches of our houses, wherever they were located. We 
were perfect souls of indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, that almost psychic and wordless interaction that is instinctive to only 
the very young would begin. We'd find a thread of common interest: a stone, a 
marble, the shredded remains of a kite caught on a power pole. Once the verbal 
door was open, nothing was held back. 
</P>
<P>
 These holders of the wisdom of the neighborhood would start conveying it to us 
-- the best and worst teachers, location of the nearest store where you could 
buy sodas and candy, the name of the kid who had a wading pool, secret 
hide-outs and the home of the neighborhood grouch. 
</P>
<P>
 After this, the rest was easy, until I had to do it all over again. Even after 
I left home and got my own apartment, I continued my ritual of checking out a 
new neighborhood by going around the block. Even though I had long ago been 
given permission to cross streets, and even though I now drove my own car, I 
never felt that anything gave me as good an indication of the soul of a 
neighborhood as that first block survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually I married and moved into my own home. I made my husband accompany 
me on my first walk even before we started unpacking. A year later, my son was 
born. He wasn't more than a month old when I bundled him up and put him in his 
stroller for his first "walk" around the block. The ritual was repeated for 
each of my two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Because I had moved so many times when I was young, I promised myself that my 
children would grow up in the same city. I kept that promise. I only moved once 
again, into a larger house with more room to raise my three young children. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day we moved into that house, in 1977, our whole family took a walk 
around the block. I pointed out to my kids the houses where children lived and 
eventually they made their way to these homes, met the young inhabitants, 
became friends and accompanied each other through grade school, junior high and 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, I still live in that same house. My children are grown, my husband and 
I are divorced. My friends tell me I should move, put the past in the past. But 
I find myself unable to let go of this place where my roots grow deep. When I 
walk around the block now I relive the history of the neighborhood, which is my 
history and my family's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of my children's friends have moved on to other areas. Some have 
graduated from college, some married and a few just disappeared. But my kids 
have stayed in touch with most of them. And those friendships provide a 
wonderful continuity to their lives that I sorely missed when I was growing up. 
That continuity and their attachment to this place will always assure that this 
neighborhood will be a part of their soul. That continuity is also what holds 
me here. 
</P>
<P>
 So I'll stay a little longer. I know there is at least one more move in my 
life -- somewhere woodsy and quiet, I hope. And I look forward to it. And to 
that first walk around the block.

SAFETY FILM ON WINDOWS HAS CLEAR BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a result of injuries suffered from broken glass during and after the 
Northridge earthquake, more and more homeowners are having safety film 
installed on window glass and wall mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
 Commonly referred to as "safety coating," this material is sold in clear or 
tinted sheets that bond to the glass during installation and prevent it from 
breaking into dangerous shards. Protection is provided not only against 
earthquakes, but also against burglary, windstorm and accident hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, tests have shown that fire safety is enhanced as treated window glass 
will contain an interior fire longer than untreated glass. Properly installed, 
the coatings are distortion free and virtually undetectable. Coatings can also 
be satisfactorily applied to glass tables and shelving. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the safety benefits, both the clear and tinted products absorb almost 
100% of the sun's ultraviolet rays to minimize damage to carpets and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, some energy savings can be realized. The clear product deflects up to 
26% of the sun's heat-producing radiation while the tinted material deflects up 
to 73%, keeping the interior space cooler on a warm day. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the coating materials are not designed for the do-it-yourself 
market. The material is more than half the thickness of a credit card and very 
tricky for the novice to install with proper adhesion while avoiding bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to locate a professional installation company in your area is to 
contact local real estate offices for a referral. Many communities (including 
the city of Los Angeles) now require safety coating of sliding glass doors 
before a home can be sold, and real estate sales people often know of qualified 
local installers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring that, the Yellow Pages will normally have many listings under "glass 
coating" or "window tinting." Be sure to specify safety coating to prevent 
shattering, not just tinting. Some of the common manufacturers are 3M, 
Armorcoat, Madica and Llumar. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, before hiring anyone to work in your home, ask for and contact at 
least three references. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices with installation should range from $3 to $5 a square foot of glass, 
depending on type of material used. Windows with grids or French mullions will 
cost extra. Many homeowners opt to treat only those windows that present the 
greatest hazard (bedroom, bathroom, hallway or entryway) to reduce the total 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Warranties against discoloration, cracking or peeling range from five to seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 A common concern about the coatings is whether the glass can be broken to 
allow escape in a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire department tests have shown that a protected window can be used for 
emergency egress by breaking through the glass from the inside without 
excessive difficulty. The glass will break at the joint where it enters the 
frame, allowing the entire pane to be pushed out in one piece with far less 
risk of injury from sharp edges. Ask your installer to explain this procedure 
in more detail.

WHAT'S IN A NAME?; RESIDENTS WORK TO CHANGE COMMUNITY NAMES IN EFFORT TO 
IMPROVE IMAGE, DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM TROUBLED AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 What's in a name? 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty it seems, at least for Buck Johns and his fellow residents of Santa Ana 
Heights. Thanks to a recent change in their postal designation, they can now 
say they live in upscale Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns and his neighbors have been trying to become a part of Newport for 17 
years, he said. Now, the last hitch is getting the city to annex the 193 acres 
of Santa Ana Heights and make the marriage official. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Heights is miles away from the city of Santa Ana, but people often 
get the two areas confused, Johns said. And, while Santa Ana suffers urban ills 
such as gangs and shootings, "Newport Beach is one of the most exclusive 
addresses in Southern California," Johns said. "Who wouldn't prefer to be in 
Newport Beach?" 
</P>
<P>
 Property values in Johns' neighborhood are expected to increase as a result of 
the address change. But not all the residents of Santa Ana Heights are happy. 
Half of Santa Ana Heights is being left behind in the name change. That half is 
the less expensive and less attractive part and hasn't been welcomed by Newport 
Beach, which consented to the name change for the most affluent area. 
</P>
<P>
 This is but one example of the battles waged by many Southern Californians 
fighting to change the names of their communities in an effort to get a richer 
image and to disassociate themselves from more troubled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon of recent name changes is particularly evident in the San 
Fernando Valley, which Father Juan Crespi named in 1769. Ever since, residents 
have been naming and renaming their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The past few years have brought on a bumper crop of name changes. All of 
Sepulveda and a part of Granada Hills were renamed North Hills. Valley Village 
was created out of a small chunk of North Hollywood. Chandler Estates was 
"moved" from Van Nuys to Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even The Times got into the act, with a contest two years ago to rename all of 
the San Fernando Valley. More than 400 people responded with suggestions such 
as Rancho de los Ranchos, Beige-Air, McValley and Twenty-Nine Malls. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the point of all this? Does it really matter what we call Sepulveda? 
Isn't a rose still a rose by any other name? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers to these questions depend on who you ask. Name-change advocates 
contend that a new name can enhance community pride and property values. 
Critics see it as an attempt by the "haves" to distinguish themselves from the 
"have-nots." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, residents of the La Tuna Canyon neighborhood of Sun Valley in the 
San Fernando Valley started a petition drive to rename their community Rancho 
La Tuna, divorcing themselves from blue-collar Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 La Tuna Canyon has about 450 homes, many of them horse properties. By 
contrast, the rest of Sun Valley is more densely populated and commercialized. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75% of La Tuna residents have signed petitions urging the Los Angeles 
City Council to approve a new name, said Arline DeSanctis, chief field deputy 
for Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The San Fernando Valley over the last 10 years has experienced negative 
change in terms of crime and density," DeSanctis said. Some residents think 
that by renaming their community they can also remake their image, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Valley is a divided community, said Jan Liptak, a 20-year resident and 
president of Sun Valley Residents Assn. "One section is more upper-income and 
the other section is more lower-income." The more well-heeled residents, she 
said, "want to get away from the negative image associated with Sun Valley." 
Liptak wants to see Sun Valley remain whole. "We all rise and fall together; a 
name change is not going to make the crime go away," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Liptak urges togetherness, La Tuna residents are debating what to rename 
themselves. While most support the name Rancho La Tuna, others like La Tuna 
Hills, Rancho Tujunga and just plain La Tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recently renamed San Fernando Valley community is Sherman Village. 
It's so new and so small that even many veteran realtors have never heard of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Village is a mini-neighborhood with 80 homes to the north of Sherman 
Oaks and to the south of Valley Village, which itself got a new name three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a two-square-mile area of upscale residences to the east of Laurel 
Canyon Boulevard became Valley Village after an 18-year fight by neighbors to 
divorce themselves from North Hollywood. The homes in Valley Village sell for 
up to $100,000 more than comparable homes in the rest of more blue-collar North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of southern North Hollywood became Valley Village -- except for one small 
neighborhood north of Sherman Oaks. Those residents felt as if they were living 
in a no-man's-land, so last fall they got their own identity -- Sherman 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
 The year 1991 was a banner year for name changes. That was the year Sepulveda 
disappeared off the map. First, the western portion of Sepulveda changed its 
name to North Hills. Then a small part of South Granada Hills joined the new 
North Hills. By the end of 1991, the eastern part of Sepulveda was so upset at 
having been abandoned by neighbors west of the San Diego Freeway that they too 
successfully lobbied to change their turf to North Hills too. 
</P>
<P>
 The same year, the 45-block area of Chandler Estates switched from Van Nuys to 
Sherman Oaks, followed by yet another defection from Van Nuys to Sherman Oaks 
only a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Temmy Walker, vice president of Prudential/Rodeo Realty in Woodland Hills, 
recalled selling a home in Van Nuys where the buyer threatened to pull out of 
the deal when he called the post office and was told the property was in Van 
Nuys and not Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to live in Van Nuys," the buyer told Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was salvaged when Walker urged the buyer to call the office of 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. A deputy explained that the area had just changed 
its name officially from Van Nuys to Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker believes the name-change phenomenon "is all an ego thing." People often 
get behind a name change because "they don't believe they have enough status." 
</P>
<P>
 And while a name change might help some with status, its effect on home prices 
is open to debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing the name of Sepulveda to North Hills has had no effect on property 
values, crime or anything else, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bobbi Miller, vice president and manager of the Woodland Hills office of 
Fred Sands Realtors, thinks some name changes can have a significant impact. 
</P>
<P>
 When the western part of Canoga Park became West Hills in 1986, she recalled, 
"it's my perception that West Hills property became more valuable immediately 
with the name change. Everyone wanted to be in West Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, agents in the San Fernando Valley say that some would-be buyers won't 
even look at Reseda and Canoga Park, but they will look at West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 While some communities debate name changes, others debate ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, 5,200 Arleta residents signed a petition to revive 
their community's old ZIP code -- 91332 -- so they will no longer have to share 
the 91331 ZIP with their more crime-plagued neighbors in Pacoima. The change is 
backed by the Van Nuys District of the U.S. Postal Service, but so far 
officials in Washington have said no. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Arleta residents are protesting with a "return to sender" campaign 
and dumping into postal drop boxes thousands of pieces of junk mail delivered 
to Arleta residents with a Pacoima address. 
</P>
<P>
 Debates over ZIP codes have been going on ever since they were introduced by 
the Postal Service. And Southern Californians have been debating -- and 
changing -- community names ever since Los Angeles was a pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cerritos was previously known as Dairy Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Smeltzer disappeared into Huntington Beach and Westminster in 1951. That 
same year Talbert became Fountain Valley, according to information provided by 
Thomas Bros. Maps. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Norwalk has a long list of previous names: New River, Siete Alisos, 
Sycamore Grove, Corazon de los Valles, Corvalles and Norwalk Station. 
</P>
<P>
 -- San Dimas used to be Mud Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The City of Gardena was incorporated in 1930 by combining Moneta and 
Strawberry Park. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the San Fernando Valley, Woodland Hills was Girard, Tarzana was 
Runnymede, Studio City was Lakewood, Northridge was Zelzah, part of West Hills 
was Canoga Park, and all of Canoga Park was Owensmouth, Sun Valley was Roscoe, 
North Hollywood was Lankershim and Reseda was Marian. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Bros. reports that it is continually adding new community designations 
to its street guides, directories and maps. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Thomas Bros. put Del Aire on the map. Sandwiched between Hawthorne, 
Lennox, Lawndale, El Segundo and the City of Los Angeles, Del Aire has existed 
for many years, but many people were unfamiliar with it because half of Del 
Aire is in Hawthorne and the other half is unincorporated L.A. County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years there has been talk of Hawthorne annexing the rest of Del 
Aire, but the neighbors want no part in it," said Tom Quintana, public 
information officer for the City of Hawthorne. "They're very proud of their 
identity." 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas that are part of Hawthorne have also kept their identity, Quintana 
said. These include Moneta Gardens (which overlaps Gardena), Holly Park (which 
overlaps Inglewood) and a community in southwest Hawthorne named Holly Glen, or 
simply "The Glen." 
</P>
<P>
 In central Los Angeles, a number of community groups push for neighborhood 
identity. These areas include University Park, West Adams and most recently, 
Jefferson Park. 
</P>
<P>
 This area -- bounded by Adams Boulevard on the north, Exposition Boulevard on 
the south, Crenshaw Boulevard on the west and Western Avenue on the east -- was 
named as an official community by the City of Los Angeles in 1988. As use of 
the name has become more popular, say locals, so too has neighborhood pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to be identified as South-Central," said Gus Harris Jr., 
chairman of the business committee of the Jefferson Park Improvement Project. 
"Everybody was referring to the area as South-Central so we decided to select a 
name," he said. Jefferson Park now has its own identity, Harris said, and "it 
has brought a cohesiveness to the area." 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of L.A. neighborhoods yearn for some cohesiveness to keep 
property values stable and crime at bay. Another example of this is a few miles 
northwest of Jefferson Park, adjacent to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Carthay Circle was planned in 1921 and founded by developer J. Harvey 
McCarthy. This 136-acre community bounded roughly by Fairfax Avenue and 
Olympic, Wilshire and La Cienega boulevards isn't really a circle at all -- but 
nobody seems to mind. The neighborhood has retained much of its original charm, 
complete with several pedestrian walkways that bisect this quiet enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, the neighborhood just south of Carthay Circle was designated by 
the city of Los Angeles as a Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ), notable 
for its Spanish Colonial Revival architecture. This neighborhood is now known 
as South Carthay and it has its own neighborhood association, signage and 
newsletter. New arrivals even get a four-page brochure detailing the history of 
this 14-square-block collection of well-manicured homes and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitalizing on the cachet of Carthay is yet another nearby neighborhood, 
Carthay Square, which is just south of Carthay Circle and east of South 
Carthay. This neighborhood couldn't become part of South Carthay's HPOZ, so 
residents got together and formed their own neighborhood association. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very important to have a name," said Wayne Saks, community 
relations representative for South Carthay and owner of City Lights Realty. 
"It's such a massive city that having a name and a neighborhood association is 
a way for people to feel they have some control." 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a community identity has helped to minimize crime and maximize 
property values, Saks said. "We can't realistically improve all of the 
Westside, but we can preserve our own neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Galperin is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. The Name Game 
</P>
<P>
 SENTIMENT BUILDS: Residents usually seek to change their community name either 
to establish an independent identity or to distance themselves from a name that 
has become tarnished. Sometimes a new identity begins with something as simple 
as a few residents -- and local real estate agents referring to an area in a 
way that has a bit more cachet. 
</P>
<P>
 PEOPLE POWER: Neighbors may form an association and refer to their area more 
frequently with the new name. Residents may also launch a petition drive for a 
name change. 
</P>
<P>
 POLITICS AS USUAL: Cities generally require city council approval for a name 
change, and that support usually begins with the backing of a local city 
councilperson. The more voter support the more likely it is that a name change 
will win political support. 
</P>
<P>
 IT PAYS TO ADVERTISE: Real Estate agents are vital in getting communities 
renamed or re-identified. Many name changes start out as community designations 
in local real estate ads. Realtors often support name changes because they make 
marketing a house in certain areas easier. 
</P>
<P>
 MAIL CALL: Residents who want to change their ZIP code along with their 
community name need the backing of Postal Service officials in the local 
district and in Washington. This can take years of bureaucratic maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
 BORDER LINES: State-sponsored county panels called Local Agency Formation 
Commissions (LAFCO) regulate changes in boundaries for cities and other 
agencies. If a city boundary change is involved in a name change, LAFCO 
approval is needed.

CONDO Q & A: MUZZLED DOG OWNER QUESTIONS NO-PET POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: A new resident who owns a dog has moved into our 24-unit condominium 
complex. When we board members spoke with her to inform her of our 
condominium's pet restrictions, we met with strong opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Our declaration of covenants, conditions and restriction (CC&Rs) clearly state 
that cats and dogs are not allowed in our building. Through the years, we have 
enforced the restriction diligently. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owner says that her real estate agent told her that a new law had been 
passed that makes enforcement of pet restrictions illegal. The real estate 
agent is not able to give us any specific information about a change in the law 
and, therefore, we do not believe her argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Are pet restrictions enforceable? If so, what is our association's next step? 
What is the buyer's next step if she wants to file a complaint against the real 
estate agent? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Yes, your pet restrictions are enforceable unless the animal is a 
seeing-eye dog or is used for some other type of assistance for a disabled 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate that the real estate agent provided incorrect information to 
the buyer. The buyer may be upset with the condominium association's board 
members; however, her real adversary is the agent who gave her the incorrect 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent may be confused because of the well-publicized lawsuit, Nahrstedt 
vs. Lakeside Village Condominium Assn. The case has now been ruled upon in the 
California Supreme Court. If the agent was relying upon the appellate court 
decision in this case, she needs to be aware of the final decision on Sept. 2, 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of three cats, Ms. Nahrstedt, moved into a condominium unit at 
Lakeside Village in Culver City. When the association's board of directors 
attempted to enforce the CC&Rs' prohibition of cats, Nahrstedt filed a lawsuit. 
She felt that she should be allowed to keep her cats since they stayed inside 
her condo unit and did not create any noise or other nuisance. At the Superior 
Court level, the case was dismissed. The court felt that the association's pet 
restriction was enforceable and refused to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Nahrstedt filed an appeal. The Court of Appeal determined that each 
challenge to the association's CC&Rs should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis 
by looking at the impact of the governing document's provisions on the 
individual owner. The appellate court ruled that Nahrstedt could keep her cats. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the appellate court's decision contained an ominous threat to the 
enforcement of many of the provisions in every association's documents 
throughout the state. Lakeside Village appealed the case to the Supreme Court, 
and the outcome was anxiously awaited. 
</P>
<P>
 During the long wait, many of us who manage and work with community 
associations were concerned about the number of lawsuits that might result from 
owners questioning the legality of any provision in the governing documents 
that the owners found objectionable. There were many discussions at homeowner 
association meetings all around the state regarding the apparent failure of the 
court to recognize the rights of the other owners who had, in some cases, given 
up their pets in order to comply with the association's restriction. Didn't 
these owners have the right to demand that other owners abide by the same 
restrictions? 
</P>
<P>
 Pet problems are often the topic of discussion at association board meetings. 
A pet that is unconditionally moved by its owner is sometimes a serious 
aggravation for the rest of the association's residents. Pets often create 
undesirable noise, odors and clean-up problems. If the owner is negligent, the 
result can be unsanitary conditions in and around the property. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of any debate about pet restrictions are those who are 
firmly convinced that pets are therapeutic and they are appalled that anyone 
would try to restrict them. The heated debates will probably continue in spite 
of the final court decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who recommend enforcement of pet restrictions are not necessarily 
pet haters. We are simply aware of the importance of protecting the integrity 
of the association's legal documents. If an association is not going to enforce 
pet restrictions, then the restriction should be removed by formally amending 
the CC&Rs by a vote of the entire membership. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 2 the Supreme Court handed down its ruling. The court upheld the 
association's pet restrictions. Nahrstedt was told that her cats were not 
entitled to reside at Lakeside Village. This is an important, precedent-setting 
decision. In my opinion, it was a great victory for enforcement of the legal 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nahrstedt case reinforces the legal validity and the strength of the 
declarations (CC&Rs) in California community associations. New owners sometimes 
purchase their condominium units without understanding that the declaration is 
a binding document. When they are informed of the declaration's provisions, 
they sometimes decide to ignore them, rather than live harmoniously with their 
fellow association members. We now have the Nahrstedt case to educate the 
general public about the importance of every community association's legal 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The law firm of Wilner, Kleir & Siegel represented Lakeside Village 
Condominium Assn. in the lawsuit. Laura J. Smoke, one of the attorneys who was 
instrumental in the association's victory, said, "The Supreme Court set forth a 
clear and sensible standard for CC&R enforcement: CC&Rs are enforceable if they 
are rationally related to a legitimate purpose of the association. In 
determining whether a restriction is enforceable, the court will analyze the 
restriction as it affects the community as a whole. No longer will boards of 
directors have to evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, whether a restriction is 
unreasonable as it applies to a specific homeowner. Instead, unless the 
restriction is unreasonable on its face, i.e., it is arbitrary or violates 
public policy, the restriction will be enforceable." 
</P>
<P>
 What can your association do about the new owner in your association? Perhaps 
by showing this information to her, you will be able to persuade her to comply 
with the pet restriction. Since your association has always enforced the 
restriction, you should not have a problem enforcing it now. Consult your 
attorney regarding your alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 If the owner refuses to comply with the pet restriction, your association 
attorney could write a letter to her informing her that her lack of compliance 
is a serious matter. She should also be informed that she will be charged for 
the legal expenses. In California and many other states, the violating owner 
can be held responsible for the payment of reasonable legal expenses incurred 
by the association to enforce the CC&Rs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new buyer who was misled by the real estate agent should talk with the 
broker of the real estate agency and also consult a real estate attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 If the agent intentionally defrauded the buyer in order to sell the unit, the 
agent has committed an offense that could lead to loss of her license or a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The association and the pet owner can file a complaint about the agent's 
misrepresentation with the local Board of Realtors, a voluntary self-policing 
trade organization, and the Department of Real Estate, which is the state's 
agency that oversees the licensing of real estate brokers and agents.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Is the garden lacking some bright spots of color? If so, plant colorful 
chrysanthemums, primrose and violas. They'll bring life to autumn gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do a final garden clean up this month. Rake old blossoms and leaves from 
under fruit trees, camellias and shrubs. Remove from the garden. Pull out old 
tomato and squash vines as well as other old vegetable plants. Mark dead boughs 
with a piece of twine or old cloth so you'll know which ones to remove during 
dormant pruning. 
</P>
<P>
 * To keep Bermuda grass lawns green all winter overseed them with Perennial 
Rye grass and then top dress. 
</P>
<P>
 * For a show of color right through winter and into spring, plant cyclamen.

GARDENING; IF YOU DIG NEW VARIETIES GROW OWN POTATOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is simply no comparison between home-grown and supermarket potatoes -- 
the flavor difference is truly dramatic. It is almost as dramatic as the flavor 
disparity between home-grown and a store-bought tomatoes. And by growing your 
own, you can harvest some of those delectable immature or "new' potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many Southland vegetable gardeners have never planted potatoes. Many think 
they are difficult to grow. In fact, they are not hard to grow and may even be 
grown in a container. And by growing your own, you can sample many of the 
flavorful and heirloom potato varieties that are only available to home 
gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ronniger, of Ronniger's Seed Potatoes in Idaho, grows an astounding 180 
different seed potato varieties for home gardeners. Ronniger's potatoes come in 
all colors, shapes and sizes. Many are heirlooms and all are grown organically. 
</P>
<P>
 With names such as German Butterball, Breen Mountain, Humbolt Red, Candy Strip 
and French Fingerling, and colors that include red, yellow, blue, white, purple 
and pink, seed potatoes from Ronniger's make for a unique growing experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronniger says that his yellow varieties are the most popular with home 
gardeners because of their delicious flavor. The yellows have a particularly 
rich, nutty flavor, he says. They also have better texture and don't stick to 
the pan while being cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 His personal favorites among his 180 varieties is Red Gold, a potato that has 
red skin and yellow flesh, and Yellow Finn, a pear-shaped variety with yellow 
skin and yellow flesh that has a particularly nutty flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Fenton, of Peaceful Valley Farm Supply in Northern California, is a 
supplier of organically grown seed potatoes. He concurs with Ronniger that 
flavor-wise, the yellow-fleshed potatoes are tough to beat. His personal 
favorites are Yellow Finn and Yukon Gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Potatoes are strictly a cool-season crop in the Southland. They are planted 
from fall through late winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fall is an ideal planting time. However, most local nurseries don't have seed 
potatoes in stock until January. You can order seed potatoes by mail from 
Ronniger's or Peaceful Valley Farm Supply; both ship them in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 To order from Ronniger's, send $2 for their catalogue and informative growing 
guide. David Ronniger said that they usually are able to fill orders through 
the fall, but sometimes if they experience freezing weather at shipping time 
(it harms the potatoes) they have to delay shipping until the weather improves. 
Send $2 to Ronniger's Seed Potatoes, Star Route 53, Moyie Springs, Ida. 83845. 
</P>
<P>
 Peaceful Valley Farm Supply, P.O. Box 2209, Grass Valley, Calif. 95945, offers 
a free catalogue that also lists unique shallots, onions, bulbs, garlic and 
organic farm supplies. They don't have near the selection of seed potatoes that 
Ronniger's has, but they do take orders by phone (916) 272-4769. Note that for 
a mail order under $20, they add an additional $5 handling charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that local nurseries should have a supply of seed potatoes after 
Jan. 1, however, they usually stock only a few varieties-mostly common types. 
Growing Your Own Potatoes 
</P>
<P>
 Potatoes require a sunny growing area. They also need a soil that is slightly 
acid -- this is a problem in most of Southern California because much of our 
soil tends to be alkaline. You can add the necessary acidity to the soil by 
adding either peat moss or soil sulfur to it. I prefer peat moss because it 
adds organic material to the soil. However, when using peat moss, you must 
moisten it before adding it to the soil; dry peat moss repels water and is hard 
to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 After you purchase your seed potatoes, if they are small, plant the whole 
potato. If they are large, cut them into two or three pieces; each piece must 
contain at least one eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Dig a trench in your garden 8 inches deep and 10 inches wide. Work into the 
top four inches of soil (in the bottom of the trench) a layer of peat moss 
(pre-moistened) and a dressing of time-release fertilizer such as Osmocote. 
Water the soil thoroughly and allow it to settle for a day before planting. 
</P>
<P>
 Lay the seed potato pieces at 12-inch intervals along the bottom of the 
trench. Next cover the potato pieces with a 3-inch layer of a soil and 
pre-moistened peat moss mixture (at the rate of one-third peat and two-thirds 
soil). When the potato plants grow to six inches above the soil line, fill the 
rest of the trench with more soil and pre-moistened peat. 
</P>
<P>
 Water the potatoes on a weekly basis if there is no rain. A convenient 
irrigation method is to lay a soaker hose along the trench. The potato plant 
has foliage that resembles its relative, the tomato. The potatoes are actually 
tubers that are formed in underground stems that will spread throughout the 
trench. 
</P>
<P>
 The potato plants will grow from two- to three-feet tall. The soil will soon 
be filled with a network of underground stems bearing many potatoes. When small 
blossoms appear on the plant, the tiny, tender "new" potatoes will be ready to 
harvest. Simply grope around in the soil and pick some. They are delicious 
boiled and buttered with parsley or chives. Try not to disturb the root system 
too much, and leave some of the small potatoes to mature to full size. 
</P>
<P>
 When the plants turn yellow and start to dry up, the rest of the potatoes will 
have reached full size. Pull up the plants and remove the potatoes. Feel around 
the soil to make certain you have them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Clean the soil from the potatoes and dry them off. Then store them in a cool 
dark place. It is important to note that exposure to light promotes the 
development of solanine, a poisonous substance that is indicated by the potato 
skin turning a greenish color. Potatoes that develop any green skin should not 
be eaten. For long-term storage, potatoes need a dark area with temperatures 
between 35-40 degrees F. 
</P>
<P>
 The vegetable crisper bin in the refrigerator makes a good storage area. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have a garden, potatoes may also be grown with good success in a 
large container such as a half-barrel type container; it must have drainage 
holes in the bottom. Fill the container with a commercial potting soil to which 
pre-moistened peat moss has been added. Mix in a time-release fertilizer and 
plant the seed potatoes halfway down in the soil mixture. Potatoes grown in a 
barrel must be watered often; keep the soil moist but not soggy. 
</P>
<P>
 Potato plants are not bothered by a light frost. However, if you live in one 
of our coldest zones, mulch the plants if temperature are expected to dip below 
28 degrees.

 QUESTION: What are my best options for door weatherstripping? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Sealing air leaks around the house is generally inexpensive and easy 
to do. Surfaces that are designed to move, such as windows and doors, are the 
most difficult to seal against air leakage. 
</P>
<P>
 Doors are especially troublesome because they are typically opened and closed 
many times a day, resulting in lots of wear and tear on the weatherstripping. 
Wood doors can become warped over time, and also tend to shrink somewhat in the 
winter due to the dryness of cold air. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, numerous weatherstrip products appropriate for wood doors are readily 
available. Costs range from about 10 cents up to $1.10 per linear foot. 
Weatherstripping 
</P>
<P>
 For low cost and ease of application it's hard to beat the foam-strip and 
plastic V-strip products that come with peel-and-stick adhesive. These products 
can provide a good seal, but shouldn't be considered a long-term solution on 
doors that get a lot of use. 
</P>
<P>
 The foam material is usually installed so it's compressed between the door and 
the door-stop. If your doors are warped, the foam may not make a complete air 
seal. A better choice for warped doors is the V-strip installed to make contact 
with the edges of the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Aluminum strips with a rubber or vinyl insert are one of the best choices for 
effective, long-term seal for doors. These products are usually nailed or 
screwed to the door stop. Careful installation is required so the door makes 
light contact with the rubber or vinyl insert -- too much compression can make 
the door difficult to close and will substantially reduce the life of the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 Brass or aluminum spring metal weatherstrip has been around for a long time 
and is designed to contact the edges of the door. Less visible and less 
obtrusive than the aluminum strips, this type works well for warped doors, and 
has a long life. 
</P>
<P>
 New on the market are narrow rubber strips designed to be installed in grooves 
cut into the door way. These systems can provide an excellent air seal with an 
attractive, custom appearance. These aren't appropriate for severely warped 
doors and require a special tool to cut the groove.

HAWAII SPECIAL ISSUE; HAWAIIAN RENAISSANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I knew the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Waikiki was big, but until last month, I 
didn't suspect it had room enough for two Hawaiis. 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious of the two is the commercially packaged version that lies all 
around as you walk the 20-acre, 2,542-room beachfront resort on a Friday night. 
On those evenings, bathed in the light of its 77 gasoline-fed tiki torches, the 
hotel stages its "King's Jubilee" show with 10 hula dancers and a man playing 
the role of King David Kalakaua, the "merry monarch" of the islands who revived 
interest in hula and Hawaiian music in the 19th Century. After the free 
hourlong performance, the hotel staff explodes fireworks over the beach, and 
thousands of vacationers stand below and marvel at the indigo sky, the creamy 
sand, the commotion of the tides. 
</P>
<P>
 I took in a portion of that scene the night I arrived. But after a few 
minutes, I snuck off to the hotel's Tapa Ballroom to spend a couple of hours 
with the other Hawaii, the one that native Hawaiians are struggling to sustain. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was a community children's hula competition, advertised on bulletin 
boards within the hotel. I paid the $10 admission and sat among several hundred 
locals to admire the dancing, chanting and drumming of 18 hula schools, known 
as halau , and the kumu (teachers) who lead them. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Hula Oni E Keiki Hula Festival, assembled by the Halau Hula O 
Hokulani, was created three years ago. If the cultural offerings outside felt 
vaguely like a Las Vegas floor show, the atmosphere of these performances 
shared more with mainland Little League games and piano recitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors offered homemade crafts. In the front row sat a line of impassive 
judges. And before them proceeded scores of nervous keiki -- children -- some 
of whom had studied hula for eight years and were just entering their teens. As 
13-year-old Jessica Kamalani Bond prepared to take her solo, the master of 
ceremonies read a few details from her bio. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she grows up," he said, "she would like to be a computer technician and 
professional hula dancer." 
</P>
<P>
 That night, and for the next six days on Oahu, Kauai and Maui, I found two 
distinct trends at work: Hawaiians are exploring and celebrating their native 
culture with more enthusiasm than they have in perhaps a century, and the 
Hawaiian tourism industry is pouring new emphasis into replicating and 
advertising the most visitor-friendly elements of that culture. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a strictly sun-sand-surf traveler, you're likely to notice small 
things here and there, many of them merely cosmetic: fewer plastic leis at the 
hotels, more Hawaiian-made products in gift shops, more taro dishes on menus. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the list grows longer daily: At the Hyatt Regency Kauai, members of the 
island's historical society meet with interested guests for "talk-story" 
sessions. At the half-dozen sites of Hawaiian Hotels & Resorts, an "essence of 
Hawaii" promotional campaign, devised last year, highlights historical aspects 
of each site. On the two ships of American Hawaii Cruises, passengers now find 
that the crew includes a traditional Hawaiian storyteller. Last month on the 
Big Island of Hawaii, the Kona Village Resort threw a birthday party for 
83-year-old Imgard Aluli, one of the state's most prolific Hawaiian 
songwriters. Meanwhile, Molokai, for decades one of the least tourism-oriented 
of the islands, now sells itself to visitors as "the most Hawaiian island" of 
them all. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to this than marketing. Glance at a community bulletin board, 
chat with a resident, make an inquiring phone call to a museum or cultural 
group, look in one of the islands' local festivals, or perhaps merely take a 
closer look at your hotel lobby, and you'll probably find hints of a deeper, 
more rewarding -- and more conflicted -- Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a stranger can easily see those 77 closely tended Hilton torch flames 
as a sign of the strange state of tourism and cultural politics in Hawaii these 
days: Everyone, it seems, is declaring his or her eagerness to protect the 
flame of native Hawaiian tradition. But for every torch-bearer, there seems to 
be another set of presumptions and ambitions and another formula for feeding 
the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 One obvious element in Hawaii's introspective mood is the delicate condition 
of the tourism industry, which generates an estimated 40% of the state's gross 
product and is only now coming back from a deep three-year slump. Too poor to 
continue the developers' orgy of mega-resorts, monorails and water slides that 
capped off the 1980s, the industry's leaders last year publicly vowed to renew 
their emphasis on trappings of traditional Hawaii, a trend that had already 
been growing for several years. Now, in ever-greater numbers, tourism leaders 
are matching hotels with local hula schools, urging local guides to pass tests 
in island history and tutoring workers in aloha spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Tourism Training Council has certified about 250 of the estimated 
2,000 tour guide-bus drivers in the state. The training program, created a year 
ago and run through Kapiolani Community College, costs about $100, requires 
about 40 hours of classroom time over 10 weeks, includes a detailed text (which 
addresses head-on such issues as the deposing of Queen Liliuokalani, Hawaii's 
last reigning monarch, and the epidemics sparked by diseases imported from 
Europe) and culminates with a 100-question exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who score 85 or higher are certified and presumably become more 
attractive to employers. The program is expected to grow from Oahu to other 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
 George Kanahele, a Cornell Ph.D. in government who has become the hotel 
industry's leading instiller of aloha spirit, estimates that his Waiaha 
Foundation has made presentations to two dozen or more hotels since his first 
effort at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel (on the Big Island of Hawaii) in 1985, and 
says he senses more receptivity now than in years past. His current clients 
include the 28-property Outrigger hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're in the hospitality business, you're in the aloha business," 
Kanahele says. "They're one and the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this is not charity work. For the hotels and their siblings in the 
tourist trade under off-island ownership, being Hawaiian may have other 
benefits, but the bottom-line objective is to lure tourists and give them 
service that will bring them back again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the background of the tourist landscape stand leaders of the 
rapidly advancing but many-headed Hawaiian sovereignty movement. For many of 
them, being Hawaiian means not only political empowerment but mistrust of past 
exploiters, including the tourism industry. Though its leaders cannot agree on 
whether they want full independence, limited sovereignty under continued 
statehood, land, financial reparations or some combination of those, the 
movement has grown so powerful that last year it extracted from President 
Clinton a formal apology to native Hawaiians, on behalf of the American people, 
for the behind-the-scenes American scheming that brought the fall of Queen 
Liliuokalani in 1893. 
</P>
<P>
 After an upwelling of public demonstrations in Honolulu on the anniversary of 
the January coup ("RETURN STOLEN LAND!" demanded one placard), the movement has 
largely receded from view of most tourists. But its advances elsewhere 
continue: In May, after decades of using the island of Kahoolawe as a target 
for practice bombings -- and recent protests by native Hawaiian groups -- the 
Navy yielded the unpopulated, ordnance-scarred island to Hawaiian control. A 
state commission is deciding how the land will be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, hoteliers and the sovereignty movement leaders aren't natural 
bedfellows. Yet as these mirror-image trends advance, each reaps benefits from 
a broader, quieter grass-roots Hawaiian cultural renaissance that has been 
building for two decades, leading more families to enroll their children in 
hula classes, more farmers to consider planting taro, whose roots when pounded 
become poi. In these circles, being Hawaiian is often a more personal matter.  
</P>
<P>
 On my second day on Oahu, I walked along the Waikiki waterfront, past stacked 
surfboards, crimson Texans, and two hip-looking Hawaiian teen-agers gently 
strumming ukuleles while a sign across the street shouted an offer of "MUUMUU 
FACTORY TO YOU" bargains. Enduring native culture in the shadow of crass 
commercialism, I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is native? A 1989 state population study found that just 1% or less 
of the islands' million-plus population was full-blooded Hawaiian, with another 
18% classified as part-Hawaiian. And if the line between native and non-native 
history is drawn at 1778, when Captain James Cook arrived, the ukulele doesn't 
make the cut. As I later learned, it didn't exist in Hawaii until Portuguese 
sailors arrived in the 1870s bearing small guitars, and locals made a few 
changes in design. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Kauai, I stayed happily at the Hanalei Bay Resort, which was rich in tennis 
courts, immaculately landscaped, featured taro pancakes on the breakfast menu 
and had just reopened after belated hurricane repairs. When I had a chance, 
however, I headed down the hill to investigate the lavish Princeville Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 That resort, on bluffs over Hanalei Bay, was renovated in 1991 into one of the 
most formal settings in the islands, with classical music in the lobby and 
employees in suits and ties. Then came Hurricane Iniki in 1992 and some 
rethinking on the part of the hotel's Japanese owners and its ITT Sheraton 
management. When the hotel reopened in October, 1993, the idea was to take on a 
more Hawaiian profile -- more aloha shirts and muumuus, less formality. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're still working with the same building. When I got there, the lobby 
gleamed with black and white marble, the lounge was lined with clubby 
bookshelves and full of classic European furnishings, and a gold-trimmed piano 
from Paris stood next to the dining-room entrance. Room rates began at $225. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:30 p.m., the blurt of a conch sounded in that genteel lobby, and a young 
man stepped forward with shell and drum, joined by a chanting woman with a lei 
and a crown of grass and bright fabric. Soon he was drumming (as his back 
rested against an overstuffed love seat), and she was dancing and narrating 
tales of Pele the volcano goddess. The cocktail crowd gathered to watch, 
applauded. I was half-ready for a waitress to appear bearing poi in fine china, 
but instead the audience fell back into pre-dinner chat, and the mist of 
surreality cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 The Princeville hotel was also contributing to a new project that seemed to 
hold interesting possibilities: a taro festival, celebrating the root that has 
been central to Hawaiian diets for centuries. The October event, staged at 
various sites on Kauai's north shore, was designed to promote camaraderie among 
island taro growers (the water-rich Hanalei Valley is one of the state's prime 
taro-growing areas) and encourage young Hawaiians to consider growing the root 
commercially. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet here, too, there's irony at work. Of roughly 50 taro growers on the 
island, estimated Rodney Haraguchi, president of the Kauai Taro Growers Assn., 
far fewer than half are from native Hawaiian families. (Haraguchi's family came 
to Hawaii from Japan three generations ago, and started growing taro in 1971.) 
And despite the cultural renaissance and a strong demand for taro, many native 
Hawaiian workers are drawn to jobs at resorts or construction companies that 
pay more and make fewer physical demands than taro farming operations do. 
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 I missed the taro festival, but my timing was better for the Eo E Emalani I 
Alakai -- that is, the sixth annual salute to the day in 1871 when Hawaii's 
Queen Emma led an expedition to the Alakai Swamp above Kauai's Waimea Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 On the appointed Sunday, I made the scenic journey to Kokee -- two hours, 
since I had to drive two-thirds of the way around the island, but what a 
pleasant chore -- climbed the narrow road along the edge of Waimea Canyon and 
pulled up at a green meadow next to the small Kokee Natural History Museum. The 
festival, which featured several hula halaus and a re-enactment of the queen's 
horseback ride through the area, had been advertised widely on the island, but 
there appeared to be only a few tourists among the hundreds who claimed free 
seats on the grass.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a great day. The sun shone brilliantly. In the shade, dragonflies 
coupled. The re-enactment of Queen Emma's ride, led by regal Lisa Uilani Pai in 
Victorian-style dress on a white horse, drew a colorful posse of tag-along 
children in BONGO brand jeans and baseball caps. While the hula halaus posed 
for photos in their leaf crowns and grass skirts, less traditionally inclined 
Hawaiians lounged in jeans and cowboy hats. And when the hula performances 
began, they communicated a range of expression not likely to be found in dances 
at tourist venues: Some dances were exultant, others were somber and mournful, 
some developed slowly and gradually, and all were driven by a stark 
accompaniment of chanting and the pounding of hands on gourds. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The most far-flung stop on my Hawaiiana itinerary was Hana, the idyllic town 
on Maui's isolated back side. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach Hana by car you must navigate the 50-odd narrow and winding miles of 
the Hana Highway, a journey that takes three hours or more. Driving the 
highway, I had that pleasant sense of trading mass commercialism for a world 
where coconut meat is peddled in driveways and waterfalls roar at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching Hana, you find that the 66-acre Hotel Hana-Maui and the 4,700-acre 
Hana cattle ranch are the center of virtually everything. The hotel was born, 
with 10 rooms and a different name, in 1946, when ranch owner and mainland 
businessman Paul Fagan imported his minor league baseball team, the San 
Francisco Seals, to spend their spring training in Hana. Sportswriters 
followed, as Fagan knew they would. One of them labeled the place "Heavenly 
Hana," and the exclusive resort was off and running. 
</P>
<P>
 Ownership has changed since then -- the management is now Sheraton -- and a 
$24-million renovation in 1989 pushed the size of the hotel to 96 rooms and 
suites, many dressed up with hardwood floors, skylights and blankets of merino 
wool, woven in England. But the staff of about 200 still includes many native 
Hawaiians, and the sprawling porches and wicker furniture are well suited to 
the tropics. For the last six years, the hotel has hosted the Haku Mele O Hana, 
a festival that gathers practitioners of traditional Hawaiian song for a 
non-competitive celebration of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 As an arriving guest, I felt I had landed in a place apart. This is as it 
should be, really, because most of us were paying more than $300 nightly. 
(There are a couple of other much more affordable lodgings in town.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's no problem slipping into the slow pace of the place -- a koi pond here, a 
canopy of trees there, a pair of long swimming pools, a "wellness center" for 
workouts, tennis courts. Shuttles leave hourly for Hamoa Beach, a nearby 
lolling spot where hotel staff members are on hand to offer refreshments. I 
snapped pictures. I watched the rain (this is the wet side of Maui.) I took a 
ukulele lesson from the hotel social director, Makala Waring, who is 
full-blooded Hawaiian. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first tune was "Tiny Bubbles," of Don Ho fame, which made for an 
interesting scene: While I strummed the chords, and rain splattered on the 
fronds outside, Waring outlined the historically close relationship between the 
hotel and its employees and stressed the importance of finding a 
tourism-friendly solution to the sovereignty question. 
</P>
<P>
 That night I signed up for the hotel's weekly luau at Hamoa Beach ($53 a head 
for adults). There was a pig in a pit oven, plenty of poi (though mainlanders 
are put off by its pasty blandness), multiple refills of rum punch, 
family-style seating at picnic tables, and lots of live guitar and ukulele 
music, performed by musicians who double as workers in the hotel's stables, 
engineering department and front office. The hula portion of the show was 
dominated by three daughters of hotel staff members, none older than 11. The 
evening ended with a rendition of "Aloha Oe," the most famous of many songs 
written by the deposed Queen Liliuokalani.  
</P>
<P>
 By day, I drove out toward Oheo Pools in Haleakala National Park. The Oheo 
Pools are a becalming scene -- a river drops by stages over black volcanic 
rocks into the sea -- but they are also a fine illustration of how, in years 
past, some promoters' idea of being Hawaiian seemed to involve a little 
artificial history. 
</P>
<P>
 Over decades, with encouragement from hotel employees and rental car 
companies, Hana has become known as the site of "The Seven Sacred Pools." This 
is despite the fact that original Hawaiians aren't known to have had any 
particular beliefs or superstitions associated with Oheo Pools or any of the 
other streams in the area, and despite the fact that, depending on the water 
flow and how you count, you might see seven or 17 or 70 pools along just about 
any stream's path. You might as well call them the Several Secular Pools.  
</P>
<P>
 Rangers for the National Park Service have abandoned subtlety on this issue 
and now hand out flyers saying "Seven Sacred Pools? There's no such place! It's 
a name made up as a sales gimmick to attract tourists to Hana . . . (and) is 
degrading to native Hawaiians who are trying to preserve their language and 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
 From Hana I headed home, sheet music to "Tiny Bubbles" folded into my 
suitcase, sand in my shoes. No matter where you are in contemporary Hawaii, 
there are certain circumstances on which you can rely. There will be sand, 
there will be sea, and there will be an identity crisis. GUIDEBOOK: Hawaiian

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; DOT UNVEILS TRUTH IN TICKETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of University of Wisconsin fans made national headlines last January 
when they arrived in Pasadena for the Rose Bowl only to discover that either 
there were no tickets as promised or they would have to pay hundreds of dollars 
more to actually see the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Transportation, determined to prevent a repeat of the scam, 
has unveiled new "Truth in Ticketing" rules that would ban tour operators from 
offering package deals to events unless it had tickets to the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "For too many years, sports and entertainment fans have been ripped off by 
unscrupulous tour operators exploiting high-demand events," said Transportation 
Secretary Federico Pena. "These regulations will require operators to tell the 
truth, or face the consequences." The new regulations are expected to be in 
place by December, before the college bowl season, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed rule, tour operators must have a substantial number of 
tickets on hand or under contract before advertising the tour. Operators may 
not accept payment for a tour unless an actual or contracted ticket is 
available for the purchaser. If no ticket is available, payment must be 
refunded within three days. 
</P>
<P>
 If the price of the tour increases by more than 10%, the consumer may cancel 
and receive a full refund. And the price cannot be raised within five days of 
the trip's departure. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulation would apply to any tour -- sporting, social, religious, 
educational, cultural, political or other -- for which admission to an event is 
advertised as part of the tour, the Transportation Department said. The Story 
Continues at Field Museum 
</P>
<P>
 "Teeth, Tusks & Tar Pits," a new permanent exhibit tracing the history of life 
from the demise of dinosaurs through the evolution of humans and the advent of 
the Ice Age, opens Saturday at the Field Museum in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit continues the story of the Earth's development that started with 
"DNA to Dinosaurs." "Teeth, Tusks & Tar Pits" is divided into sections that 
chronologically represent "slices of time" -- landmark periods and events in 
Earth's history -- and laboratory sections that explain the "hows" of 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, located at Roosevelt Road and Lake Shore Drive, is open from 9 
a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. For information, call (312) 922-9410. Treetop Tours in 
the Rain Forests 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the canopies of the world's rain forests -- hidden worlds that 
start about 30 feet up and may extend to more than 150 feet above the ground -- 
remained a mystery. Now, thanks to the efforts of a handful of scientists, this 
largely unexplored world of natural history is becoming more accessible as 
interest in so-called "green" travel burgeons. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, two facilities that allow tourists to tiptoe through the 
treetops have opened. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Rica, the Rain Forest Aerial Tram (pictured at right) is operating on 
a 1,000-acre reserve that borders the Braulio Carrillo National Park, about 50 
minutes from San Jose. The tram, a converted ski lift, can accommodate five 
visitors and a naturalist-guide on a 90-minute ride. The lower leg of the tram 
ride skims over hilltops and through the sub-canopy, a dark world of 
overburdened limbs dripping with mosses, ferns and orchids. Then the car climbs 
to about 100 feet above ground, to the tops of the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The tram is the brainchild of Donald Perry, who earned his Ph.D. in biology at 
UCLA in 1983 and who built the forerunner of the lift as a research tool. 
Later, he said, he decided it was a perfect tool for education and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 The private reserve plans to open a visitors center and 10 cabins in January. 
There are also several hiking trails. Tram rides are $47.50 per person For more 
information, call 011-506-257-5961 or fax 011-506-257-6053. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway around the world, in the tiny Pacific sultanate of Brunei, a treetop 
walkway has been completed in the 113,287-acre National Park of Ulu Temburong. 
The project consists of five aluminum alloy towers, 164 feet high, rising 
upward through the trees and connected in a straight line by a walkway at the 
131 feet level. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brunei project is patterned on a project carried out in neighboring 
Malaysia where the government built a tree tower canopy walkway to preserve its 
famed, 6,052-acre Pasoh Forest Reserve in the state of Negri Sembilan. 
'Mahler's Last Years' at Carnegie 
</P>
<P>
 "Mahler's Last Years" -- the first exhibit of all 10 autographed manuscripts 
of the symphonies by Gustav Mahler and his song cycle, "Das Lied von der Erde," 
-- opens Nov. 16 in Carnegie Hall in New York City. The 3 1/2-month exhibit 
coincides with the second year of Carnegie Hall's two-year Mahler Celebration. 
The display will close March 1.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: YOSEMITE; AHWAHNEE AUTUMN; A GRAND OLD HOTEL IN A STUNNING 
SETTING . . . WHAT BETTER WAY TO PASS A NOVEMBER DAY; SEAN AND I CHASED EACH 
OTHER ALONG THE CREEKS, CLIMBED ON FELLED TREES AND SKIMMED STONES ON THE 
GLASS-TOPPED MERCED RIVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Roderick is a Times Assistant Metro 
Editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beneath our fourth-floor window a young doe nipped at blades of frosty grass, 
oblivious to our gaze. She grazed for a quarter-hour then slipped through the 
wall of trees between us and the Merced River. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean, our 4-year-old, climbed on the table for a better view. Even better, her 
mother wore a satisfied smile. It was the kind of scene she had demanded to 
help her pass (painlessly, she hoped) a milestone birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy chose between celebrating in one of her favorite destinations, Santa Fe, 
or a new treat she had long fantasized about. So here we were in Yosemite 
Valley, cocooned for two November nights in the grand old Ahwahnee Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 We had often enjoyed the Ahwahnee's elegantly rustic dining room, huge stone 
fireplaces and placid meadows as looky-loos. Sean had even picnicked at a 
barbecue the hotel threw for firefighters who battled the wildfires that closed 
Yosemite Valley for 10 summer days in 1990. But this was our first chance to 
walk right in without feeling that we were interlopers in the 67-year-old 
landmark, built of granite rock and concrete beams stained to resemble redwood 
and cleverly hidden in a forest on the valley floor. It felt good to drive up 
and, for the first time, check in like so many others we've watched. 
</P>
<P>
 For Judy it felt better than good. The Ahwahnee's public spaces -- a warm 
lobby, mammoth sitting room decorated with Native American artifacts and 
Persian tapestries and a warren of alcoves for quiet reading -- are among her 
favorite places to just hang out. It's best on a winter afternoon, sitting on a 
sofa in front of a fire when snow is settling on the valley and the hotel is in 
repose. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason we opted for a room inside the main building and not in one of 
the cottages sprinkled around the grounds, even though the price was the same: 
$208 a night for a standard double room. (That rate drops $20 midweek from Nov. 
28 until Feb. 3, 1995.) It might have been different if the cottages had 
fireplaces -- only a few do -- but the furnishings were comparable. All rooms 
were recently redone to add modern amenities such as air conditioning, TV and 
honor bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy was relieved to reach the hotel for another reason. She struggled with a 
flu bug for most of the six-hour drive from Los Angeles and left her lunch 
beside the highway in Visalia. She gets car sick anyway, and the winding route 
into Yosemite from Oakhurst didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the famous valley overlook -- with its views of Half Dome and waterfalls 
-- couldn't work its usual magic. When we reached the hotel, she tumbled into a 
lobby easy chair to sweat out check-in. Once upstairs, it was into the bath, 
then into bed. 
</P>
<P>
 That left me and Sean alone with a 6:15 dinner reservation, carefully 
scheduled weeks before to give us time to arrive and relax before an early 
meal. We decided to make it a date. I threw on clean pants and a turtleneck, 
put Sean in a dress and led the way downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This being off-season, we had to share the hotel with 100 or so wine 
aficionados attending one of the seminars the Ahwahnee packs in during autumn 
and winter. But I was warned over the phone by the woman who arranged our 
reservations, and the oenology buffs were not in evidence when we strode into 
the Ahwahnee's signature dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 Soft light bathed the massive room from high chandeliers. Sean gushed with 
pride when the maitre d' led us to our candle-lit table, in a desirable corner 
near the 30-foot windows. Over a Shirley Temple (with two cherries) and a glass 
of Chardonnay, I began her education in Yosemite lore. 
</P>
<P>
 She's still weak on the confluence of glacial scouring and geologic thrusting 
that created Yosemite Valley's high granite cliffs and waterfalls. But she 
liked the part about the bears who open ice chests and about how her daddy, 
aunt and uncles also came to Yosemite when they were her age. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually Sean went off to make acquaintance with another Yosemite tradition, 
pianist Dudley Kendall, a fixture in the Ahwahnee dining room. She often 
requests a round of "Itsy Bitsy Spider" when she finds such a willing victim, 
but she let Dudley off easy and just watched him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was early the next morning when we saw the munching deer. Judy felt much 
better and came down to the dining room for a birthday breakfast, a difficult 
meal to pass up here. Light pours in the picture windows, carrying views of the 
Cathedral Rocks and the woods that surround the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy stuck to the hot Irish oatmeal, but Sean went for the traditional 
pancakes -- which were done just right, as was my raisin brioche French toast. 
Judy's birthday wish was to spend a leisurely day with her Nikons taking 
pictures in the meadows, recharging her creative cells. While she made pictures 
in the morning light, Sean and I chased each other along the creeks, climbed on 
felled trees and skimmed stones on the glass-topped Merced River. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley streams were nearly dormant. Nothing was coming over Yosemite 
Falls, we discovered after jumping in the car to locate a new photo spot. We 
did find water surging over Bridalveil Fall after a short hike. 
</P>
<P>
 That night our dinner reservation was not until 7:30 so we had time to relax 
around the hotel and dress for dinner. We weren't aware that the Ahwahnee's 
traditional dress code had been relaxed to allow men to wear open shirts and 
sweaters, although jeans and outdoor wear are still frowned on. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though I had made arrangements for a special window table, the wine 
seminar commandeered most of the dining room. We were relegated to a cluster of 
tables near the entrance and, to our chagrin, the service suffered -- a notable 
irritant since it's the ambience and not the quality of the cuisine that makes 
the Ahwahnee special. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the meal was enjoyable given the surroundings. The kitchen was willing 
to prepare some plain pasta for Sean, my prime rib was fine and Judy ate what 
she could stomach of her lamb. They do take wine pretty seriously -- we found 
the Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon very pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
 By previous arrangement the hotel had prepared a chocolate birthday cake. The 
hotel also will arrange for flower arrangements to be sent up to the park from 
Mariposa, and offered to put together a fruit basket for our arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 One caution about the Ahwahnee for a special occasion. With only 123 guest 
rooms, reservations for popular times are hard to get. Book as far ahead as 
possible, up to a year in advance. Budget for Three

TAKING THE KIDS: HEADING FOR HULA HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The December holidays have traditionally been a popular time for California 
families to visit Hawaii. Many island resorts celebrate Mele Kalikimaka (Merry 
Christmas) and Hauoli Makahiki Hou (Happy New Year) with special holiday-themed 
activities and children's programs, while lobby trees are festooned with 
ornaments made from shells and hand-carved wood. 
</P>
<P>
 But families dreaming of watching a lei-draped Santa arrive by surfboard or 
outrigger canoe had better hurry. For the first time in several years, many 
accommodations are already booked for the Christmas and New Year's holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some hotels left, but most of the condo space is gone . . . and 
what's available won't be cheap," warns Ricci Zukerman, owner of To Hawaii 
Only, a Costa Mesa travel agency that specializes in travel to Hawaii. "The bad 
economy over the past few years has programmed people to wait until the last 
minute to make plans, but this time around they won't be able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The current spate of holiday no-vacancy signs -- the largest number since 
1990, agents and tour operators say -- is reminiscent of the late 1980s, when 
holiday space was usually snapped up by June or July. Contributing to the 
rebound are an improving economy in California, Hawaii's top market; last 
spring's introduction of low-priced charter-airline service from the West Coast 
and an increase in Japanese visitors. Hawaii-bound procrastinators still hoping 
to nab a room at the inn should be as flexible about dates and locations as 
possible. One- and two-bedroom condos on Maui, Kauai and the Big Island are in 
greatest demand, but families willing to settle for a studio will still find 
several choices, said Ken Phillips, of Westlake Village-based Pleasant Hawaiian 
Holidays, one of the islands' leading tour operators. 
</P>
<P>
 The week between Christmas and New Year's is sold out at many properties, but 
those who can extend their stays into early January or wind up their vacations 
by Dec. 22 or 23 will have much better luck. Another possibility: Check for 
last-minute cancellations, since many tour operators who reserve blocks of 
rooms or seats release any unsold space 30 days before arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuletide visitors to Hawaii will find a state with a multicultural melange of 
holiday traditions with many resorts going all out to give the keiki (children) 
and their parents a holiday to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Outrigger Hotels' Royal Waikoloan, on the Big Island, offers lessons for 
families in different Hawaiian crafts on the 12 days before Christmas, while 
guests at Sheraton's Hotel Hana-Maui are invited to attend local Christmas Eve 
services in Hana. (Call Outrigger at 800-462-6262, the Hana-Maui at 
800-321-4262.) 
</P>
<P>
 Before booking a resort specifically for its children's program, ask enough 
questions to be satisfied there will be something for your family.  
</P>
<P>
 Ask about price, too. Some children's programs are included in the cost of a 
room, such as the Four Seasons Resort's Kids for All Seasons on Maui; the 
children's program at the Halekulani at Waikiki Beach; and the camp at Mauna 
Lani Bay Hotel on Hawaii. (Call the Four Seasons at 800-334-6284, the 
Halekulani at 808-923-2311 or the Mauna Lani Bay at 800-327-8585.) 
</P>
<P>
 The idea at most resorts is to give the kids a taste of Hawaiian culture. At 
the Embassy Suites Resort on Maui, kids can weave birds and fish from coconut 
fronds or learn a few Hawaiian words. (There is a $15 registration fee and a 
charge of $10 a day; $7 for additional children from the family, including 
lunch. Call 800-462-6284.) 
</P>
<P>
 Aston Kaanapali Shores' Camp Kaanapali on Maui offers kids hula lessons and 
takes them on walks to explore the native flora. (After the $10 registration 
fee, camp is free. Lunch is extra. Call 800-922-7866.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ritz Kids at the Ritz-Carlton Mauna Lani on the Big Island, meanwhile, visits 
ancient fish ponds and petroglyphs ($40 a day), while campers at Camp Hyatt on 
Kauai may tour archeology sites. ($45 a day). Campers at Camp Wailea at 
Stouffer Renaissance Wailea Beach Resort on Maui ($35 a day) might learn about 
different kinds of lava or make grass baskets. (Call the Ritz-Carlton at 
800-845-9905, the Hyatt Regency Kauai at 800-233-1234 and Stouffer at 
800-HOTELS-1.) 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears the first and third week of every month.

HIKING: MONTEREY COUNTY: A LAKE WITH A COASTAL AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lake San Antonio is located, a park brochure claims, "in the Central Coast 
area of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake's geographical position near the back side of Big Sur gives it some 
claim to Central Coast fame. So does its location within the boundaries of one 
of California's best-known coastal counties -- Monterey. Cool winters and the 
spring wildflower displays in San Antonio Valley also bolster the lake's 
Central Coast status. 
</P>
<P>
 But other scenes and seasons argue that Lake San Antonio is more a part of the 
Central Valley than the Central Coast. Near the lake, agriculture abounds -- 
rolling grassland dotted with cattle, miles of manicured orchards, grain fields 
and almond groves. And the lake itself, Monterey County's largest, is a 
reservoir created in the late 1950s for use by Salinas Valley farmers and 
ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake's dual personality also extends to its recreational opportunities. In 
summer, when temperatures regularly reach the 90s, water-skiing, jet skiing, 
swimming and sunbathing are favorite activities -- typical of the great Central 
Valley's huge "reservoir parks." During cooler months, the lake is a tranquil 
place, ideal for camping, bird-watching and hiking. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle Watch boat tours are scheduled from December through March on Fridays, 
Saturdays and Sundays. Call the park for more information.  
</P>
<P>
 Getting to the lake: It is about halfway between Los Angeles and San 
Francisco. (A stop at Lake San Antonio is a good way to break up the Southern 
California to Bay Area drive.) Leave U.S. 101 just north of Paso Robles on G-14 
(Lake Drive). Head north past almond orchards and rolling blue oak-dotted 
hills. Stay with G-14 as it assumes two more identities (Nacimiento Lake Drive 
and Interlake Road) and winds between Lake Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio. 
Turn east on San Antonio Road and follow it a few miles to the park.  
</P>
<P>
 The park has about 20 miles of trail -- footpaths, rough fire roads and 
hillside fuel breaks. A nature trail loops a mile and, with the help of an 
interpretive brochure, introduces hikers to local flora and geology. Harris 
Creek Trail (three-fourths mile one way) leads along the lake shore from Harris 
Creek Campground to the park's most inviting beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Trail: Best hike in the park is along Basham Point Trail, which begins at 
road's end at Basham Point on the Harris Creek arm of the lake. The path (2 1/2 
miles one way) leads west along Harris Creek, a sometimes spooky-looking 
watercourse when morning mist lingers over ghostly, half-submerged oak trees. 
When the trail reaches a park boundary fence (cows graze the private hills 
beyond), it swings sharply right (north) and ascends an oak-lined draw to 
Redonda Vista Campground. Nature, Harris Creek, Basham Point Trails Where: Lake 
San Antonio County Park, southeast Monterey County. Distance: 1 to 5 miles 
round trip. Terrain: Lake shore, oak-dotted hills. Highlights: Good 
leg-stretcher halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Degree of 
Difficulty: Easy to moderate. For More Information: For more information: Lake 
San Antonio County Park, P.O. Box 2620, Bradley, Calif. 93426; tel. (805)

SHOPPING: QUILTS; STICHES IN TIME; HAWAIIAN QUILTS GET A FRESH AIRING AS A NEW 
GENERATION DISCOVERS THEIR SPECIAL BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RITA ARIYOSHI, Ariyoshi is a Honolulu-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wailani Johansen sits by her quilting frame in the living room of her small 
Lahaina house, ocean breezes drifting in past the hibiscus bushes as she 
stitches her way into the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both my grandmothers were Hawaiian. I watched them quilt with my aunts," says 
Johansen, now white-haired herself. "We used to raise our own sheep and card 
our own wool for batting. We wove our own fishnets, and we'd cook the fish with 
green seaweed and shrimp and sweet potatoes. Life was so rich. . . . When I sit 
here sewing, I recall all of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaiian quilts like Johansen's, called kapa lau, are prized as much for their 
spiritual qualities as for their material value. Each one is named, and their 
makers claim the kapa lau are stitched with such love and prayer that they are 
endowed with mana, or spiritual presence. Generations of islanders have passed 
along family quilts as heirlooms, and when one finally deteriorates, it is 
burned rather than allowed to fall into disuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this art form that had been kept alive only through the patience of old 
Hawaiian women is enjoying a fresh airing. The abstract designs can be found 
blanketing beds, walls, clothes, pillows, even purses and pot holders. Quilting 
classes are packed with young mothers, middle-aged and recently retired women, 
and tourists. Prices for authentic quilts have gone through the roof, and Third 
World copycats have hit the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Custom, hand-sewn Hawaiian quilts cost anywhere from $2,000 to $8,000 and take 
from three months to a year to complete, depending on the quilter, the 
complexity of the design and the size. But Hawaiian-style designs made by hand 
in the Philippines and sold in Hawaii cost around $1,000, and a few Hawaiian 
entrepreneurs are turning out machine-made versions for as little as $250. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, it is tourism -- often blamed for the demise of local cultures 
-- that has spurred renewed interest in the art. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Laurance Rockefeller gave Hawaiian quilting its biggest boost in 
1965 when he commissioned 30 quilts to decorate the walls of his new Mauna Kea 
Beach Hotel (closed for renovations until December, 1995). Soon, the quilts 
began appearing in hotel lobbies around the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The developing Hawaiian sovereignty movement, which has encouraged pride in 
the cultural legacy of the islands, is another factor contributing to the kapa 
lau's new popularity -- along with the prosaic fact that contemporary 
furnishings mix well with the quilts' large, bold designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery surrounds the origin of the Hawaiian quilt, just as it veils the 
beginnings of all things Hawaiian, even the people themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Many people believe the first Christian missionaries from New England 
introduced the art of quilting to Hawaii. In 1820, a group of Hawaiians boarded 
the brig Thaddeus as it cruised along the Big Island's Kona coast. Lucy 
Thurston, in the mission party, wrote in her journal: "Monday morning, April 3, 
1820, the first sewing circle that the sun ever looked down upon in this 
Hawaiian realm was organized. Kalakua, Queen Dowager, was directress. She 
requested the seven white ladies to take seats with them on mats, on the deck 
of the Thaddeus. Mrs. Holman and Mrs. Ruggles (were) to ply the scissors and 
prepare the work. . . . The four native women of distinction were furnished 
with calico patch work to sew -- a new employment for them." 
</P>
<P>
 One popular story has it that the distinctly Hawaiian style of quilt-making 
was born sometime later, when a woman who was drying bed linen on her lawn 
noticed the shadow a breadfruit tree cast upon her sheet. She was so inspired 
by the dramatic silhouette that she cut it out, basted it on another piece of 
material and stitched the first Hawaiian quilt. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hawaiian women were creating their own versions of decorative bedspreads 
by the time the missionaries arrived. Before contact with the Western world in 
1778, the Hawaiians had a history of sewing with olona plant fiber and needles 
made from bone. They also had a taste for fine bedding and transformed tree 
bark into beautiful soft kapa sheets, to which they applied their own stamped 
designs.  
</P>
<P>
 "To cut new material into bits to be sewn together (as the missionaries did 
with their patchwork quilting) seemed a futile waste of time," writes Stella 
Jones, a pioneer researcher in the study of Hawaiian quilts. "It was quite 
natural, therefore, that these (Hawaiian) women, accustomed each to her own 
designs. . . and her own individual wood-blocked patterns, should produce 
patterns of their own."  
</P>
<P>
 Several technical characteristics distinguish the kapa lau from other American 
quilts. Instead of being pieced together patchwork-style from many swatches of 
fabric, the kapa lau is made from just two pieces of cloth: One forms the body 
of the quilt, while another, cut in a bold, often geometric design, is 
appliqued on top. The two pieces are usually, but not always, solid colors of 
contrasting hue.  
</P>
<P>
 To make a design for a Hawaiian quilt, the piece to be appliqued is folded and 
cut out like a snowflake from paper. Once the design is sewn onto the body of 
the quilt, rows of closely spaced stitching spread out from the appliqued 
fabric in much the same way that waves radiate from island shores. Traditional 
batting materials include pulu , the soft fibers of the native treefern; and 
human or domestic animal hair. Today it is usually wool or cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a hula, each Hawaiian quilt tells a story, conveys a message, and has 
kaona , an inner, hidden meaning. Elizabeth Akana, award-winning quilter and 
author of the book, "Hawaiian Quilting, a Fine Art." She recalls her children 
once saying of her quilts, "It's like they talk to you." Akana answered, "Well, 
they're supposed to. You let love come from your heart through your hands and 
into the work. It's love that gives it life." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration is usually found in nature. Flowers such as ginger, plumeria, 
crown flower and bird of paradise are popular motifs, along with pineapples and 
breadfruit leaves. Waterfalls, volcanic fires and mountains appear as well. 
Some quilters have drawn themes from Spanish combs, ivory fans, chandeliers and 
even Halley's comet. One valued quilt called "Ka Lanai O Kolomona" (Solomon's 
Porch) was based on the intricate wrought-iron railings on the front porch of a 
man named Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
 History is another rich source, yielding royal crests, crowns and calabashes 
from the monarchy era. When the Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown by American 
settlers in 1893 and flying the Hawaiian flag became an act of treason, 
families quilted flags onto canopies of their four-poster beds so they could 
sleep under their beloved flag and hold it in a place of honor above their 
heads.  
</P>
<P>
 This gave rise to a whole school of Hawaiian quilt -- kapa hae , or flag 
quilts. Five years ago, a flag quilt sewn in 1899 fetched $44,000 (believed to 
be the highest price ever paid for a Hawaiian quilt) at auction at Christie's 
in New York. Among Hawaiian families, they are still the most treasured -- 
rarely displayed by their owners and surrounded by an air of secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can see Hawaiian quilts on display at several resorts and museums 
across the state. Two of the best hotel collections are those at the Hyatt 
Regency Maui and the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel (until the Mauna Kea reopens next 
year, part of its collection hangs at the adjacent Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel.) 
Museum examples include Honolulu's Bishop and Mission Houses museums, the Lyman 
House Memorial Museum on the Big Island and the Kauai Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Finished quilts, pillow kits, pillow shams and fashions can be purchased in 
many quality gift shops around the islands. If a shop claims its quilt is made 
in Hawaii, always ask for a certificate of authenticity. Otherwise, you may be 
buying an import. 
</P>
<P>
 Many quilt patterns are copyrighted and jealously guarded, but for those 
inspired to craft their own versions, traditional-style patterns in the public 
domain are available at the Waianae Public Library on Oahu. In gift shops, 
pillow kits run from $24 to $40 (compared to $35 to $70 for finished pillows). 
Quilting lessons are offered at several museums and stores, often for free, and 
can easily be squeezed into the standard Hawaiian routine. GUIDEBOOK: Island

DESTINATION: WAIKIKI; VINTAGE VACATION; A NOSTALGIA-SOAKED SEARCH FOR REMNANTS 
OF A PRE-DON HO PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN MELINKOFF, Melinkoff is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My first visit to Waikiki came 40 years too late. I wanted Arthur Godfrey's 
Hawaii. Harry Truman in aloha shirts. A lei-strewn Matson Liner welcome at the 
docks. Alas, both Arthur and Harry have gone on to the big luau in the sky and 
at the Honolulu airport, fresh leis must be purchased out of refrigerator 
cases.  
</P>
<P>
 My attachment to the islands comes from the Hawaiiana I have collected over 
the years -- postcards, books, magazines and photos from what I call the 
pre-Don Ho era, the time between 1927, when Matson Line opened the Royal 
Hawaiian Hotel and inaugurated passenger service between California and Hawaii, 
and the late 1950s, when statehood, jet travel and the arrival of Elvis 
signaled the end of that romantic period. Though I couldn't experience the 
Golden Age of Tourism firsthand, I was determined to find a few vestiges of the 
past on my trip last summer.  
</P>
<P>
 On my old postcards, the Royal Hawaiian Hotel is surrounded by acres of lush 
palm groves. The grounds are now pared down in size, but thickets of elephant's 
ears and birds of paradise still hug the pink Moorish palace. The salons, no 
longer overdecorated in pattern-on-pattern splendor, remain stately and cool. 
Tacky Waikiki, just beyond the porte-cochere, seems far away. 
</P>
<P>
 The room of my dreams (Diamond Head view, of course) was $350 a night, so I 
contented myself with breakfasts and late-afternoon drinks at the Royal's Surf 
Room and Mai Tai Bar. Sitting there, I could reach over the sea wall and grab a 
handful of Waikiki sand, remembering photos of Bing Crosby playing a ukulele 
serenade on the same spot, Shirley Temple being made an honorary Waikiki 
lifeguard . . . probably a few feet away, Cary Grant (a guest in the 1930s) 
relaxing in the teak deck chairs that still face the water. Through trial and 
error, I discovered that the best time for drinks at the Royal Hawaiian is at 
sunset on Wednesdays. That's when local outrigger-canoe clubs practice in the 
bay with Diamond Head as the backdrop -- just like they did 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke's Canoe Club restaurant in the Outrigger Waikiki Hotel, wedged (really 
wedged) between the Royal Hawaiian and Sheraton Moana Surfrider, is on the site 
of the original Outrigger Canoe Club -- a hang-out for Hawaiian beach boys with 
names like Chickie, Squeeze, Panama Dave and Ox. Today, it's a Chart 
House-kind-of-place that pays homage to the Golden Age with Duke Kahanamoku 
memorabilia on the walls. The restaurant's namesake was the most famous of 
these beach boys -- a two-time Olympic-swimming gold medalist (1912 and 1920) 
and Hawaii's most recognizable figure. It's worth a walk-through, even if you 
don't eat here, to study the old photos of Waikiki beach life and get a sense 
of how big and heavy those old surfboards were. A shiny, dark 17-footer is on 
display.  
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1901, the Sheraton Moana Surfrider is the oldest hotel on Waikiki 
Beach and, thanks to a $20-million restoration in 1989, it retains its 
Victorian splendor. The 99-year-old banyan tree helps . . . and so do the 
ornate banisters and molding. Old-fashioned rocking chairs line the front porch 
facing Kalakaua Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The essence of vintage Waikiki is the Moana's banyan veranda and patio. For 40 
years, beginning in 1935, "Hawaii Calls" was broadcast to as many as 750 radio 
stations from this spot. The hula music was interspersed with sounds of waves 
lapping the shore and announcements of the air and water temperatures (torture 
for listeners in Syracuse in mid-January, which was the intent). 
</P>
<P>
 Now, evenings in one corner on the patio, a group of Hawaiian musicians play 
old-time hapa-haoli (half-Caucasian) songs. Listeners can order drinks from the 
courtyard bar or, better yet, settle into luxurious, over-sized rattan chairs 
on the broad veranda for drinks and a $9.95 all-you-can-eat, 
takes-the-place-of-dinner hors d'oeuvres buffet. Here, the paradise that 1950s 
mainlanders like my grandparents dreamed about is still palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of Waikiki from the Moana, a convincing re-creation of 
"Hawaii Calls," now called "Sounds of Aloha" for legal reasons, is recorded 
Thursday evenings at the Shell Bar of the Hilton Hawaiian Village. This hotel 
is very 1960s in its ambience, too recent for my tastes, but close your eyes 
and you're back 40 years: "Sweet Leilani" plays, followed by an announcement of 
the current water temperature, usually hovering around 80 degrees. The show is 
broadcast on Honolulu's all-Hawaiian-music radio station KCCN on Saturdays at 
11:30 a.m. It's also broadcast in Los Angeles on KJOI (Sundays, 8 a.m.) and 
KGRB (Sundays at 10 a.m). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The closest I got to the steamship welcome of my dreams was at the Matson 
Liner exhibit at the Hawaii Maritime Center, on the Honolulu docks. Paper 
streamers cascade over the side of the S.S. Lurline (well, a few feet of 
starboard anyway). A horn blows. On the headset tour, a former steward talks 
about the glory days of leisurely ocean-liner travel by the well-to-do. There 
is a life-size re-creation of a corner of the elegant dining room, and old film 
footage takes us back to yesteryear. The centerpiece of this exhibit is a 
4-foot-by-8-foot original oil painting of one of Eugene Savage's Art Deco 
Matson menu covers depicting Hawaiians welcoming Captain James Cook at 
Kealakekua Bay on the Big Island. The free Kodak Hula Show, held Tuesday 
through Thursday mornings in Kapiolani Park, has been a tourist attraction 
since the 1930s. While it has evolved over the years (adding Tahitian dancers 
in neon-colored grass skirts), the house orchestra remains endearing: 14 
musician tutu (grandmothers) in long muumuus and sun hats perform throughout 
the free, hour-long photo opportunity.  
</P>
<P>
 The Waikiki 3 theater, built in 1936, is one of a few remaining Art Deco 
buildings in Waikiki. I've seen old photos from the 1940s showing sailors 
hanging around the entrance, which is much the same today and best seen from 
the balconies of the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Mall across Kalakaua Avenue. 
Unfortunately the interior, once the swankiest on the islands, has been 
stripped of its papier-mache palm trees. They still show movies here, but gone 
are the usherettes dressed as alii (royalty). 
</P>
<P>
 Having collected Hawaiiana for years at Southern California flea markets, I 
wondered what vintage souvenirs could be found in situ . I'd heard about the 
aloha shirts at Bailey's but was a little disappointed with the shop. Sure, 
plenty of shirts, but there were too many (I never thought such a thing 
possible), too jammed together. And the prices seemed more keyed to Tokyo 
buyers than habitues of the Rose Bowl swap meet.  
</P>
<P>
 I was much more tempted by two other shops. At Antique Alley, a collectibles 
mini-mall, several of the dealers sell Hawaiian items (though none 
exclusively): artifacts, old coins and Ming's jewelry -- tropical-themed 
earrings and brooches popular during the '40s and '50s. Pake Zane has the most: 
old menus, photos, postcards, hula-girl lamps and the insider knowledge of 
someone who lived through the time period. 
</P>
<P>
 At Clair de Lune, a swank shop with haute-'30s and '40s sensibilities, the 
rattan furniture, gaudy hibiscus draperies and tropical paintings have been 
chosen with great care. I wanted it all. 
</P>
<P>
 I would never have known about the Waioli Tea Room had I not loudly bemoaned 
my 40-years-too-late fate to Zane. He joined in my lament, but agreed there 
were a few survivors from the Golden Age. Did I know about the Waioli, which 
reopened last year after being closed five years? He promised it was a haven 
from the Waikiki tinsel that few mainlanders know exists. But, he said, 
occasional tourists have been making their way there since the 1920s, when the 
tea room was opened by the Salvation Army to train unwed mothers in 
waitressing.  
</P>
<P>
 Set amid the lush landscape of the Manoa Valley, a few miles north of Waikiki, 
the last remaining old-style Hawaiian restaurant still offers job opportunities 
to those needing new skills. Meals (curries, salads, sandwiches, pasta) are 
served on the broad, cool, wrap-around porch. Robert Louis Stevenson was said 
to have visited Hawaiian royalty at a hut behind the building; all were in 
search of cooler weather. Even today, the place is usually 15 degrees cooler 
than the coastal plain below. 
</P>
<P>
 During lunch, a mother-and-son duo dressed in matching Hawaiian ensembles 
moves from table to table playing requests, all pre-Don Ho classics. Mom sings 
and plays the ukulele while her courtly son plays bass. As I was leaving, 
another diner asked when the duo would be returning to the dining area. The 
answer: in a few minutes -- they were busy playing for the help in the kitchen.

LAX CONTROL OVER STATE HUMANE OFFICERS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: ANIMAL CONTROL 
'DEPUTIES' MAY WEAR UNIFORMS, CARRY GUNS AND MAKE ARRESTS, BUT THEIR RANKS ARE 
VIRTUALLY UNREGULATED.

<P>
 When Capt. Barbara Fabricant ordered that Steven Hazzard give up his beloved 
guide dog, Starsky, while she investigated allegations that he kicked the 
animal, the blind computer programmer balked, but obliged out of deference to 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fabricant had neither interviewed Hazzard nor examined Starsky to 
determine if the charges were founded, she was, after all, not only a state 
humane officer, but "director of criminal investigations." 
</P>
<P>
 And Guide Dogs for the Blind, the Bay Area group that trained Starsky, told 
Hazzard that Fabricant had threatened to haul in their executives on felony 
charges, too, if he did not cooperate. So Hazzard, of Westchester, spent the 
next five months unemployed and mostly homebound, without his "eyes" and his 
best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 What Hazzard and the guide dog association did not know was that the 
.357-magnum-toting, uniform-wearing "Capt." Fabricant is a strange sort of cop, 
one of a little-known group of non-governmental peace officers. 
</P>
<P>
 They are authorized by the state of California to carry guns, conduct criminal 
investigations and make arrests throughout the state. They can wear uniforms 
and badges nearly identical to those of Highway Patrol officers. Yet despite 
the powers conferred on them under an obscure civil code, a Times investigation 
has found that humane officers such as the 68-year-old Fabricant operate 
virtually unregulated and unsupervised. 
</P>
<P>
 They are nominated for their positions by private animal welfare organizations 
-- which can be founded by a single person -- and in many cases are given 
badges and are authorized to carry guns with little or no training. They are on 
no government payroll. They belong to no police department. They have no chief. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No government agency supervises them, or even keeps track of who they are or 
how many are out there -- not even the California Department of Justice, which 
oversees the professional qualifications of other peace officers throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," said Norman Boehm, executive director of the state Justice 
Department's Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training, in a recent 
interview. Like other state officials, he said he was unaware of the police 
powers and lack of oversight on such officers until asked about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they're doing. Who in the world is out there carrying guns? 
. . . I have no idea where they get their authority. You need a job with a 
government organization in order to act as a peace officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, according to Civil Code 607f, you don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the code, private animal-welfare groups submit names of humane officer 
candidates to the presiding judge of the county's Superior Court for approval. 
The candidates pay a $5 fee and need only 12 hours of training in animal care 
and a course in state humane laws within a year of receiving the badge. 
(Fabricant holds classes at her Canoga Park home.) 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court official Georgene Nagamine said: "Our job is to 
just send the forms up north for processing." 
</P>
<P>
 If training is not available within 100 miles, the law says humane officer 
candidates are exempt from even that requirement, as are people who became 
officers before 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 All it takes to slap on a gun belt and carry a weapon is an introductory 
firearms course available from community colleges, a course that Boehm said 
"amounts to nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates' fingerprints are sent to Sacramento for a cursory Justice 
Department check for a criminal record. After that, they are on their own until 
they have to reapply three years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The records of state humane officers' identities are kept in each county's 
principal courthouse or recorder's office. State officials say they have no 
idea how many there are, or who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any oversight," said Michael Van Winkle, spokesman for the 
Justice Department's law enforcement division. "No one here is aware of any." 
</P>
<P>
 Humane officers have been around for more than 80 years, throwbacks to a time 
when cities and counties had nobody trained or available to investigate 
complaints of animal abuse, poisoning and theft. Local humane societies were 
authorized to provide deputies to fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many California counties and most large cities now have paid, 
professional animal control officers, the humane officers linger as "one of 
those loose things from way back in history," said Darrell Stewart, a former 
state highway patrolman and current spokesman for the Commission on Peace 
Officer Standards and Training, which sets standards for all law enforcement 
officers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lobbying effort aided by protests from organizations for the blind 
over Hazzard's loss of Starsky, a private association of state humane officers 
persuaded the state Legislature this summer to enact stricter training 
requirements, effective next year. But some critics, and some animal rights 
groups, say much more needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a lot of these loose cannon people . . . all of these Lone Rangers 
running all around the state," said the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Animals' new executive director, Madeline Bernstein. "We need to 
wipe out these gun-toting people who are out there claiming to be officers. . . 
. Who the hell knows whether they've gotten all the credentials or not? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone and their mother wants to be a humane officer," she added, "so they 
can go out and carry a gun and shoot people who are mean to animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricant says she agrees. "I want all this exposed," she said Friday. "Take 
away the right to carry a gun, and you will eliminate 90% of the phonies. And 
then only people who want to help animals will be humane officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Humane officers are not required to go through the rigorous background checks 
and psychiatric evaluations that conventional police forces employ to weed out 
potential problem officers, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need those people to be absolutely stable, of sound mind," Stewart said. 
"It's frightening if through loose regulations, inappropriate people are 
carrying firearms. It's bad enough in rural areas, let alone urban ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, court documents and interviews show that humane officers have been 
accused of overstepping their authority, ruining crime scenes and evidence and 
generally confusing and confounding other law enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 County records obtained by The Times show that Fabricant has used her status 
as head of an animal rights organization named the Humane Task Force to create 
her own group of gun-toting deputies that include lawyers, doctors, 
contractors, actors and a retired watch repairman. The group, which Fabricant 
directs out of her home, has in the past year asked that 21 more people be made 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne and Barbara Chronister are suing one of Fabricant's former deputies for 
the return of cats seized in a raid on their Riverside County home last year. 
In another raid months earlier on the family's previous home in Glassell Park, 
one of Fabricant's lieutenants, news media in tow, arrested Barbara 
Chronister's daughter and seized dozens of animals that the officer and 
Fabricant suspected were being abused. 
</P>
<P>
 He "put (the daughter) in the clink" on suspicion of animal cruelty, Fabricant 
said. Police freed the woman that night, but misdemeanor charges are pending 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Adams, an attorney for the Chronisters, said the family has been 
terrorized by Fabricant's group and other animal rights activists. "They want 
to have their own arm of the law. Some animal rights groups are utilizing these 
officers as their own personal posses," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Fabricant approached her several years ago, saying Adams' legal 
expertise would make her a good addition to Fabricant's humane officer team. 
"She tried to hire me, and she never met me before. She said if I wanted to 
carry a gun and badge and wear a uniform, I could," Adams said. Fabricant 
confirms she tried to recruit Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 When humane officers who had worked with Fabricant appeared at a city Board of 
Animal Regulation Commission meeting several months ago, one was ejected for 
carrying an illegally concealed firearm, according to a city official who was 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During last year's Malibu/Calabasas fire, as firefighters were frantically 
trying to evacuate residents from the area ahead of the onrushing flames, 
Fabricant asked a radio station to broadcast appeals summoning equestrians with 
horse trailers to the fire line to help rescue panicked horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire departments kept saying, 'Who is doing this?' (Other law enforcement) 
organizations kept saying they didn't know," said one official familiar with 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricant responded that she never knew emergency officials were upset by her 
actions. "We personally transported over 1,000 horses, not to mention cats, 
dogs, birds, you name it. If we had not been there, what would have happened to 
all those animals?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake, Fabricant, in full uniform, held a news 
conference outside the city's West Valley Animal Shelter, urging viewers not to 
turn over to city officers any of the hundreds of panicked pets running loose 
from their homes because "most people do not trust Los Angeles animal 
shelters." 
</P>
<P>
 City animal control officers, who have butted heads with Fabricant for years, 
were irate. They said they received complaints that Fabricant and her aides 
were collecting lost dogs and cats and keeping them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are working our butts to the bone, understaffed, trying to unite 
people with their pets," said Lt. Richard Felosky, then a supervisor of the 
city Animal Regulation Department for the West Valley. "It was an unbelievable 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricant said they only confiscated dogs and cats that looked as though they 
did not have owners. "We picked up 53 dogs from the various parks," she said. 
She said she took some of them home with her while she looked for their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "My house was a mess," Fabricant said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are many humane officers who go through far more training 
than the law requires, such as the officers of the Los Angeles Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Other humane groups, such as those in 
Glendale and Marin County, voluntarily forbid their officers to carry guns 
unless they are headed for a dangerous neighborhood or may need the gun to put 
an injured animal out of its misery. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we need to, we can contact the police," said Glendale Humane Society 
director Michael Peatrowsky. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are many others who secure nominations from small, little-known 
organizations, according to leaders of other animal welfare groups and officers 
of official agencies, like the city Animal Regulation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are well-meaning but radical animal rights activists, said Bernstein of 
the L.A. SPCA, which has its own crew of humane officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The origins of Fabricant's group are unclear except that Fabricant started it 
and then had herself nominated to be a humane officer, according to court 
records. She concedes that she made up her impressive title -- captain in 
charge of criminal investigations -- as she began to accumulate deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend told Fabricant: " 'You can't get much higher than captain,' " she 
recalls, "so I'm a captain." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her deputies, Fabricant concedes, joined up just so they could "carry 
a gun, kick ass, make arrests and throw their weight around. People are wearing 
badges that have no damned business having badges and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a scary situation," she agreed. "Let's say one of my officers shoots 
someone. I can be sued." 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent day out in the field, Fabricant acknowledged that she has had 
to "decertify" -- yank the badges of -- many of her officers because they 
became problems. County records show that one of them was an ex-husband, John 
Toth. 
</P>
<P>
 Another one "had (police) lights all over his vehicle. He was pulling people 
over on the freeway, making arrests. . . . He was throwing his weight around. . 
. . I found out how devious people are, and what lengths they'll go to carry 
concealed weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricant said she does not know how many humane officers she has working for 
her, or how many she has "decertified." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to even think about all the dumb things I've done here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one case, county records indicate that a Los Angeles-area humane 
officer suspended by Fabricant helped create another animal rights group, 
nominated himself to be an officer and swiftly regained his badge. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricant, known as a leader of psychics and fortunetellers in the San 
Fernando Valley, is the widow of Sid (The Squid) Fabricant, identified by 
police as an organized crime figure when he died in the early 1980s. One of her 
sons is in the Hells Angels, she said, and the front door of her home bears a 
decal: "Support your local Hells Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 She has equipped her 1977 Plymouth station wagon with red and blue lights and 
official "diamond E" license plates so that it resembles a police car and is 
exempt from state fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts sometimes send Fabricant convicted people to carry out "community 
service" sentences, including one person Fabricant put to work trapping stray 
cats, according to city animal control officers. 
</P>
<P>
 One day recently, Fabricant responded to a complaint phoned in by an animal 
rights activist. Because she was wearing black stretch leotards, a tie-dyed 
blouse and sandals, she had to show her badge to persuade an Asian family that 
spoke little English to let her into their house. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding the badge to a peephole in the door, she said: "I'm a police officer. 
Policia. " 
</P>
<P>
 She said she often does wear her uniform at lunchtime because "if I go (to 
restaurants) in uniform, we get half price." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Hazzard and Starsky? 
</P>
<P>
 His troubles started when he was attacked on the street, Hazzard says, and 
several witnesses mistook the commotion for him kicking the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 After Fabricant ordered the guide dog association to confiscate Starsky, 
pending her investigation, its members examined him, declared that he had not 
been harmed and returned him to Hazzard. Fabricant called executives of the 
association, threatening them with arrest unless Starsky was re-confiscated, 
according to Hazzard's complaint in a lawsuit that he brought against the guide 
dog group to get Starsky back. 
</P>
<P>
 After five months and $25,000 in legal fees, a retired judge appointed as 
mediator ruled there was no evidence that Hazzard had abused Starsky and 
ordered him returned. Many witnesses testified in his suit to regain Starsky 
that Hazzard never so much as raised his voice to the dog, and would apologize 
if he accidentally walked into him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard's lawyer, Mark Brylski, complained in his brief that Fabricant's 
handling of the case "reflects a lack of impartiality and professionalism and a 
willingness to use threats in order to obtain her objective." 
</P>
<P>
 California is not the only state with law enforcement personnel like the state 
humane officers. Bernstein of the L.A. SPCA said she recently left the New 
York-based SPCA after the board of directors became embroiled in scandal over 
their carrying guns, which she opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, however, has a state agency that monitors credentialing of all sworn 
peace officers, from humane officers to transit police to fish and game 
wardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a central registry and they are on top of it all," Bernstein said. 
"There is no such thing here. It certainly would get rid of a lot of the crap 
if there were."

USUALLY SEDATE WATER BOARD CONTESTS HEAT UP; ELECTION: SLATE OF MINORITY 
CANDIDATES CHALLENGES POLICIES OF LOW-PROFILE AGENCIES THAT CONTROL LUCRATIVE 
CONTRACTS. SOME INCUMBENTS QUESTION THE GROUP'S MOTIVES.

 Is it something in the water? 
</P>
<P>
 The normally quiet races for water boards -- those contests relegated to the 
bottom of the ballot -- are emerging as a new political battleground for a 
slate of minority candidates seeking entree to the obscure but financially 
potent industry that controls billions of dollars in contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 These part-time elective posts have traditionally been overshadowed by the big 
statewide, legislative and local races, but this year a coalition of eight 
minority candidates is trying to open up the boards that have been dominated 
for decades by white, male business interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The minority candidates, all affiliated with the political machine of former 
Rep. Mervyn Dymally, are seeking to wrest control of three water boards in 
bitterly contested elections. Such battles are unusual in the staid and 
gentlemanly world of water, where holding office is usually guaranteed for 
life. In all, 30 candidates are vying for eight seats, some of which have never 
before been contested. 
</P>
<P>
 Dymally, a black leader who was one of the first to break the color barrier in 
statewide politics, likens the battle to the school board fights of the 1960s. 
"We're breaking new ground," Dymally said. "We're breaking up the old-boy 
network." 
</P>
<P>
 But some incumbents say the challengers have a hidden agenda. They say their 
opponents are more interested in financial gain than social justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They smell money," said Vergil Clyde Haight, director of the Central Basin 
Municipal Water District and a candidate for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Up for grabs are the boards of the Central and West Basin municipal water 
districts and the Water Replenishment District of Southern California, which 
store and distribute water for a patchwork of more than 70 communities from 
Malibu to Long Beach and inland to East Los Angeles and Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 The boards have long conducted their business in relative obscurity and with 
near total autonomy. The small but politically astute group of challengers is 
questioning the priorities, the policies and the makeup of these agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Dymally's son, Mark, a candidate for the West Basin Municipal Water District 
board who organized the slate of African American, Latino and Asian American 
candidates, says the election is about diversity of representation, access to 
contracts for minority businesses and the structure of rates that he says fall 
unfairly on poor and urban communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone should share equally in the resources," Mark Dymally said. "That is 
why we are running." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some incumbents seem mystified by the influx of contenders. "Who ever 
heard of the West Basin Water District?" asked incumbent Ed Little. "This is no 
steppingstone in politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as candidate John Allen, a deputy district attorney, said: "Nobody knows 
who we are and nobody cares." 
</P>
<P>
 So the sudden emergence of the Dymally group is leading many in the water 
industry to question their motives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't put my finger on why so many people associated with Congressman 
Dymally are expressing all this interest in water boards," said Bob 
Goldsworthy, a director of the Water Replenishment District. "It's a nagging 
question and I don't have the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the answer is clear: the tremendous financial clout of the water 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the recognition is beginning to dawn on people that there is 
significance to these seats in terms of political capital," said West Basin 
Municipal Water District Director Gary Morse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central and West Basin districts collectively spend about $10 million a 
month on construction programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, the Central and West Basin boards send six 
representatives to the powerful Metropolitan Water District board, where 
billions of dollars worth of business is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the big prize," acknowledged Mark Dymally. 
</P>
<P>
 Dymally, 39, worked as a water resources specialist at the MWD for 10 years 
before resigning in April to form an independent water institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, three Dymally affiliates -- Kenneth Orduna, Clarence Wong and 
Albert Robles -- have been elected to the board of the Water Replenishment 
District. After gaining control of the five-member board, they voted to give 
themselves a $308-per-month car allowance, gave a $42,000-a-year Sacramento 
lobbying contract to a business partner of Mervyn Dymally and increased the 
public affairs budget from virtually nothing to $300,000 last year, according 
to the district's acting general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Car allowances and six-figure public affairs budgets are unusual for small 
water agencies, and even some larger and more complex agencies such as the 
Three Valleys and Upper San Gabriel municipal water districts do not have such 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 Orduna, formerly chief of staff to Rep. Dymally and now president of the 
Replenishment District, defended the spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my campaign pledges was to make the public more aware of water," said 
Orduna. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the car allowances help directors make the rounds of community 
meetings and that public affairs expenditures were used largely to fund a 
series of community festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for the Sacramento lobbyist, he said, "that needed to be done. If we 
don't have someone up there, we won't get the dollars that are needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Water Replenishment District board member Goldsworthy, who is not affiliated 
with the Dymally group, agreed that the lobbyist has helped open doors for the 
district. But he said the public affairs budget has grown too large and needs 
to be reined in. Last year, he proposed eliminating the car allowance but was 
outvoted 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Dymally foes also say the former congressman solicited business from the 
Central and Western districts last spring, but was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 District administrators say Mervyn Dymally, in a meeting arranged by Orduna, 
was seeking municipal bond underwriting business. But Dymally said he was not 
seeking a contract. He said the purpose of the meeting was simply to find out 
if the district was using minority contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no economic interest in this," the former congressman said. "I'm just 
having some fun after politics. No one is trying to make a living out of it. 
Certainly not me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Dymally said incumbents and other challengers are raising questions about 
his motives to avoid the real issues in the campaign, including what he says is 
mismanagement of the districts' finances and operations. 
</P>
<P>
 He has questioned the decision by West and Central Basin boards to build a 
$150-million water reclamation plant, which will primarily supply water to 
industrial customers, such as oil refineries. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Dymally said it is not right that all residents in the district 
are required to subsidize the plant through property tax assessments, although 
the water is to be used by just a few customers. 
</P>
<P>
 And given the visceral response his challenge has elicited from the 
incumbents, he said: "I suspect there is bigger trouble with the financing of 
the plant than they want to let on." 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbents say the plant is necessary to guarantee a future supply of 
water for the district. "This is a fantastic thing," said Charles Stuart, a 
director of the West Basin district. "This will be the salvation of the South 
Bay." 
</P>
<P>
 But the younger Dymally said the plant is a tangible sign of the gap between 
the needs of the district's inner-city poor and the actions of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Mark Dymally formed the Robert Smith Water Institute to examine such 
issues and to "articulate the concerns of the urban poor." 
</P>
<P>
 The institute was named for an African American friend of the Dymally family 
who repeatedly ran for various water boards -- and lost -- in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Dymally says the institute, housed in Mervyn Dymally's Inglewood business 
office, plans to launch a series of studies, including one to determine if poor 
areas pay higher water rates than affluent communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be tough to get funding" for the study, said Dymally, whose institute 
has no financial backing. "It's not something the traditional water community 
wants to explore." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several candidates have raised questions about the legitimacy of the 
institute, calling it a front for Dymally candidates. The ballot designations 
could make a difference in races where most candidates are unknown to the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ballot, Mark Dymally lists himself as president of the institute and 
three other candidates -- Charles M. Trevino, Richard Mayer and Joann S. 
Williams -- call themselves institute directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith McDonald, son of Assemblywoman Juanita M. McDonald (D-Carson), lists 
himself by his institute job title, water conservation analyst. Michael J. 
Robbins, a candidate for the Water Replenishment District, lists himself by his 
institute title, water conservation specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something to give them a name to run on," said Little, the incumbent 
West Basin director seeking reelection. "It's a highfalutin name. 
</P>
<P>
 "They concocted that thing to try to lend an air of respectability for the 
campaign," said Stuart. "It's the biggest bunch of hogwash." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Romero, a spokeswoman for the county registrar-recorder, said that in 
response to complaints from some candidates, the elections agency checked on 
the ballot designations and concluded that they were legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 The extensive political experience of the Dymally group has intimidated some 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no interest in tangling with a legend like Mervyn Dymally," said 
Richard Heath, who is running against Mark Dymally for a seat on the West Basin 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 And at least one of the candidates has sought elective office before. Orduna 
in 1987 ran for Los Angeles City Council, but his bid was unsuccessful and he 
ended up being fined $187,000 by the state Fair Political Practices Commission 
for 134 violations of campaign law. At the time, it was the second largest fine 
ever levied by the watchdog agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a very politically astute bunch of people and they are running in an 
arena of political amateurs," said Morse, the Central Basin director. "I fully 
expect opposition when my seat comes up. These seats will likely be forever 
political." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Mark Dymally said he has received inquiries from minority groups in 
Ventura and San Diego about launching similar challenges in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Mervyn Dymally has his way, this process won't stop with the water 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 His next step? "I'm going to go out and find out how many mosquito control 
districts there are."

THE HERALD IS 5 YEARS GONE, YET THE STORIES LIVE ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "It really didn't die, did it?" said Max McCrohon, the last editor of the Los 
Angeles Herald Examiner, as he looked around at the 150-plus old Herald hands 
who were gathered to remember the newspaper that had been so much a part of 
their lives, and the life of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same sort of comment you heard five years ago last week, on the 
night the Herald closed down, about how the Herald really wasn't dead, that its 
spirit would live on. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of the Herald cost L.A. a piece of itself, the last of its 
old-style, screaming-headline, kick-out-the-jams newspapers. Ever since 1903, 
when press baron William Randolph Hearst blew into town and created what he 
called "an American paper for the American home," the Herald Examiner and its 
precursors had chronicled -- no, Heralded! -- the tumultuous history of the 
city, story by story. 
</P>
<P>
 At its height, the Herald was the biggest afternoon paper in the country, 
cranking out a million copies a day in 12 frantic editions. At its ebb, after a 
brutal 10-year strike that began in the late 1960s, it was a financially ailing 
but editorially feisty morning daily known for its "second-coming" headlines: 
"WOW!" for the 1984 Olympics opening ceremonies, "LAKERS!" when Magic and Co. 
won the '87 NBA championship, "GUILTY!" for the 1989 conviction of Richard 
Ramirez, a.k.a. the Night Stalker -- a nickname invented, incidentally, by 
Herald City Editor Larry Burrough. 
</P>
<P>
 It was relentlessly local. Given a choice between a parliamentary shake-up in 
England and an escaped hippopotamus named Bubbles from a Southland wild animal 
park, the Herald went with Bubbles every time. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a newspaper feared beyond its circulation numbers by a generation of 
L.A. politicians and officials, one of whom, then-Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, 
paid the Herald perhaps the ultimate compliment when he said its closing meant 
"one less pain in the posterior." 
</P>
<P>
 When all that ended five years ago, it was nonetheless said by the newly 
unemployed Herald hands, as they gathered in the paper's watering hole, Corky's 
bar, that the Herald could never really be dead. Because the Herald was not 
just a printing press, a building and a fleet of circulation trucks. The Herald 
was people, newspaper people -- Herald people -- and as long as those people 
were around, it would live on. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sort of brave talk you might hear at a funeral, when people try to 
persuade themselves there really is a place in heaven for dear departed Uncle 
Harry. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for a few hours Saturday afternoon it seemed true as the former Herald 
staffers gathered at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel to mark the fifth 
anniversary of the newspaper's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been five years already?" said Ramon Munoz, who spent 20 years at the 
Herald Examiner, working in the production department. "I loved it there. I 
still miss it." 
</P>
<P>
 "People have such great memories of the paper," said McCrohon, who flew here 
from Washington to attend the reunion. "There was just such a great spirit 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a place you went to kick up your heels and to shake people up," said 
Jim Bellows, Herald editor from 1978 to 1981. "We had a great time." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of stories flew back and forth. There was the time in the early '80s 
when a Herald reporter was kidnaped while covering a story in South-Central Los 
Angeles and was later ransomed for $18 and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 
There was the time word came in that a window washer was dangling by one foot 
18 stories above a Downtown sidewalk and an assistant city editor sent a cub 
reporter out to "try to get an interview with the guy before they reel him in." 
</P>
<P>
 There was talk about the legendary figures in Herald history: The Chief 
himself, William Randolph Hearst, who fired editors almost nightly over the 
phone. And Aggie Underwood, the crusty, cigar-smoking woman who ramrodded the 
newsroom as city editor.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, that was really all there were . . . just memories. The 
Los Angeles Herald Examiner was no longer alive. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't die.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: PRINT JOURNALISTS MUST KEEP FINGERS ON THEIR 
KEYBOARDS AND EYES GLUED TO THE TUBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of my fellow print reporters want to keep the television cameras out of 
the O.J. Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reasoning goes like this: We're serious. TV people are superficial. 
We're considerate. They're intrusive. We're smart. They're dumb. 
</P>
<P>
 So why, they wonder, is a paper such as the Los Angeles Times joining with its 
electronic rivals Monday to persuade Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito to open 
the Simpson courtroom to the cameras? 
</P>
<P>
 Part of it is that we're all part of the brotherhood and sisterhood of 
journalists, pledged to fight for the 1st Amendment, which guarantees freedom 
of the press. An attack against one is an attack on all. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's another reason. We in print need TV. It would be hard to cover the 
Simpson trial, or many other big stories, without it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This has certainly been true with the Southland's wave of man-made and natural 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone figured there would be trouble after the Simi Valley jury acquitted 
the police officers accused of beating Rodney G. King, but nobody thought it 
would be as bad as it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Print reporters were dispatched to African American neighborhoods on the 
theory that this is where racial tensions would explode. But the terrible scope 
of the disaster was only clear from the air, where TV helicopters, armed with 
cameras, recorded the fires that extended over wide areas of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 The unrest was unfolding so frighteningly fast that television became the 
primary tool for the newspaper in figuring out where reporters and 
photographers should be deployed. 
</P>
<P>
 When I sat down late that afternoon to write a column on the verdicts in Simi 
Valley, my television set was on. Things looked tense, even dangerous, when I 
started. While writing, I watched the beating of trucker Reginald O. Denny at 
Florence and Normandie avenues. I saw fires break out, first a few and then 
more. The situation continued to deteriorate as my editor read my story, 
changing it to reflect the spreading mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 This is just the experience of one person. Multiply it many times, in 
newspaper offices here and elsewhere, and you can see the impact of television 
on editors and reporters in the print business. The same was true with the 
earthquake and when fast-moving brush fires scorched the region last fall. In 
each case, newspapers were greatly helped by television pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Simpson trial, television will be especially important to the 
printed press. That point was made by Steven Brill, president of Court TV, the 
24-hours-a-day, seven-day-a-week cable network, which provides gavel-to-gavel 
coverage of many trials. Court TV would operate the cameras inside the 
courtroom, acting as a pool, supplying pictures to networks and stations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement to the court opposing a TV ban, Brill said: "Because only 27 
seats have been reserved inside the courtroom for the press, the pool camera 
has facilitated an unimpeded flow of information to those reporters not able to 
attend court proceedings on any given day, who have watched the proceedings 
from the media center on the 12th floor of the courthouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some people may resent the change from the old days when newspaper 
and radio people were the world's only eyes and ears, television has actually 
become an ally for those of us laboring in the world of ink. For the drama and 
immediacy of television coverage whet the public's appetite for even more 
information. And newspapers are best equipped to go into depth, exploring why 
those events happened. 
</P>
<P>
 That is also true of the Simpson case. For me, without television, it would be 
difficult to write this column on the trial because we have only one courtroom 
pass and it goes to the reporter who covers the case day in and day out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although all of this is important to how we cover the story, it's a small part 
of what will be debated in Judge Ito's court Monday. There, the issue will 
really be about the degree to which the public will be able to see for itself 
the administration of criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing this system work is especially important to L.A., where so much social 
tension is caused by minority residents' suspicion of law enforcement and the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Print, television and radio are part of the process. "To work effectively," 
former Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court wrote in 1980, "it 
is important that society's criminal process satisfy the appearance of justice 
. . . and the appearance of justice can best be provided by allowing people to 
observe it."

CARRYING ON COLORFUL TRADITION; FAMILY'S SCULPTURES EXHIBITED AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 100 years the unusual craft was handed down from father to son. 
</P>
<P>
 Four generations had learned how to turn scraps of paper and clumps of dirt 
into things of beauty -- festive masks, candy-filled pinatas and distinctive 
calaveras that had become something of a holiday tradition in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 So Pedro Linares was naturally pleased when a woman from UCLA stopped at his 
modest Mexico City workshop seven years ago to say that an exhibit of his 
family's unusual papier-mache sculpture was in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 The 81-year-old Linares was assured he would be invited to the show when it 
opened in five years or so. It would take that long to organize and schedule a 
first-class exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might be dead by then," the old man replied. "But if I am dead, will you 
still invite me? I'll be there, I promise you." 
</P>
<P>
 Linares died in 1992. And that explains why a jaunty-looking skeleton figure 
will be positioned near the entrance to a Fowler Museum of Cultural History 
gallery when the long-planned exhibition opens at noon today on the Westwood 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Using paste, paper and brightly colored paints, Linares created a whimsical 
self-portrait en calavera -- the distinctive skeletal art form that reveals the 
Mexican attitude toward death that is depicted during Day of the Dead 
celebrations. The November rites welcome the "return" of the souls of the 
deceased for a visit with their families. 
</P>
<P>
 The baseball cap-wearing skeleton will introduce visitors to 150 other Linares 
papier-mache sculptures on display for the show, which is scheduled to run 
through July 16. 
</P>
<P>
 " En Calavera : The Papier-Mache Art of the Linares Family" is a tribute to 
work that evolved from folk art to fine art, said show curator Susan Masuoka -- 
the woman who told Linares about the exhibition plan years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with traditional cartoon-like skeleton figures, family members' 
sculpture includes intricately detailed dragon creatures that Pedro Linares 
nicknamed alebrijes . 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA museum has acquired Linares artwork for about 30 years, according to 
education director Betsy Quick. The collection was started when the university 
purchased pieces shown at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art as part of a 
Mexican art exhibition. Los Angeles had been the final stop of a traveling show 
that in 1963 had visited 15 American and European cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Private collectors including filmmaker Dennis Hopper have loaned other pieces 
for the current show. 
</P>
<P>
 Linares' three sons -- who will demonstrate traditional papier-mache 
techniques today from noon to 2 p.m. -- arrived Thursday for the opening. They 
explained their work to a small group of schoolchildren Friday and to 140 Los 
Angeles-area elementary schoolteachers Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The family profession was started by Pedro Linares' father, Jose. In the early 
days, the craftsmen used scrap paper and clay soil to form their sculpture; 
dirt mixtures added color to their creations. 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe Linares, 52, a member of the third generation in the artistic line, 
said he was stunned when he stepped into the Fowler Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were surprised to see work of my father that we hadn't seen since 1950," 
he said. "And my father's piece by the door -- there was sadness seeing that. 
But everybody's going to die. We take a humorous look at it: That's life." 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Linares, 60, said the family realizes it is carrying on the Mexican 
cartonero (papier-mache) tradition, but they intend to continue their father's 
style of personalizing sculpture too. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Linares, 44, said the family did not realize at first that its 
handiwork was valuable. Now, some of the family's work fetches $35,000 from 
collectors. But the Linareses have not forgotten their roots. 
</P>
<P>
 They still craft fiesta masks for youngsters at their workshop close to Mexico 
City's municipal Merced Market.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw a kid come in and pick up a Mickey Mouse mask for $4, I thought, 
'That's a good deal,' and I ordered one myself," museum curator Masuoka said of 
a recent trip to Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came back to get it my price was $20. They have a different price 
structure for local kids -- they're staying in touch with their local 
audience."

3 ARRESTED, COUNTERFEIT DOCUMENTS CONFISCATED; CRIME: AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THEY 
BUSTED A MAJOR RING IN CANOGA PARK. LEADERS ARE BELIEVED TO BE AT LARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of phony documents were seized and three people were arrested 
Saturday in connection with what authorities said is a major counterfeiting 
ring that manufactures fake driver's licenses, immigration cards and other 
official papers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth time in two years that undercover Los Angeles police officers 
and state investigators had busted counterfeiters hawking documents in a 
parking lot at Sherman Way and Variel Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers followed the suspects from the parking lot to a nearby apartment 
that served as a "paper mill," where the phony documents were assembled. 
Investigators confiscated a laminating machine, a typewriter with different 
daisy wheels, a paper cutter and hundreds of blank birth certificates and other 
documents from the two-bedroom apartment in the 6900 block of Millwood Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators believe the ringleaders of the counterfeiting operation are 
still at large because the printing press on which the documents were 
manufactured was not among the equipment seized. 
</P>
<P>
 The ring operates out of Canoga Park because of its high concentration of 
immigrants, investigators said. Detective Michael Lewin estimated that the 
counterfeit operation netted thousands of dollars every week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a steady, ongoing thing," Lewin said. "We look for it, clean it out, and 
about a week later, there's a new crop back." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators identified two of the suspects as Sandoval Cota, 18, of Sonora, 
Mexico, and Ernesto Llanes, 22, of Sinola, Mexico. But they said the men used 
counterfeit documents to identify themselves, so investigators have yet to 
confirm their identities. 
</P>
<P>
 The third suspect was identified as Alonso Yerena, 29, from Mexicali, who told 
police that he is a naturalized citizen from Mexico whose documents were stolen 
in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 All three suspects were arrested on suspicion of felony forgery and were being 
held at Van Nuys Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail each. If convicted, they could 
face up to a year in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The bust was made by the multi-agency Community Effort to Combat Auto Theft 
(CECAT) task force, which includes the California Department of Motor Vehicles 
and the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous busts include the breakup last year of a paper mill operating out of 
an apartment on nearby Gault Street after detectives purchased phony documents 
in the names of Gov. Pete Wilson and City Councilwoman Laura Chick. Six men 
later pleaded guilty to forgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Saturday's discovery of the counterfeiting lab began about 1:30 
p.m. as CECAT officers were driving back from an unrelated investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators noticed the suspects signaling the availability of forged 
documents to passersby in the parking lot of a local shopping center and set up 
an impromptu surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewin said Cota took information supplied by Yerena back to the Millwood 
Avenue apartment. Half an hour later, Cota and Llanes left the apartment, 
bicycling back to Yerena with a phony Social Security card that cost about $30. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested the three men in the parking lot. Three others believed to be 
lookouts fled.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; POTPOURRI OF POLS VYING IN 14 RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There's the 19-year-old UCLA student. And the 75-year-old veteran lawmaker. 
The lesbian lawyer and the ex-judge with Christian fundamentalist ties. A 
hardware store owner, a swimming pool contractor, at least two millionaires, 
nine attorneys and one law student. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only three women, and no minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are among the 28 Democratic and Republican candidates running for 14 
state Senate, state Assembly and congressional seats in the region stretching 
from the Antelope Valley to the Santa Monica Mountains and from Glendale to 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2.5 million people live in this vast area, and about one-third of these 
will be eligible to vote in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 14 races, two are highly competitive. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 * The 24th Congressional District race between Rep. Anthony Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills) and attorney Richard Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete 
Wilson. Armed with a background as a policy wonk, a fat campaign treasury 
(subsidized with more than $400,000 of his own money) and the vigorous support 
of the national GOP apparatus, Sybert, 42, poses a serious threat to 
Beilenson's bid for a 10th term in Congress. (See accompanying story.) 
</P>
<P>
 * The 43rd Assembly District race between Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale) 
and former federal prosecutor Adam Schiff, the Democrat. With the help of hefty 
campaign contributions from Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, Schiff, 34, is 
trying to prove that a Democrat can get elected to the Glendale-Burbank area, 
long a GOP stronghold. Rogan, 37, a former judge, was elected last spring to a 
seat held until February by Pat Nolan, who was forced to resign from the 
Assembly after pleading guilty to political corruption. (See accompanying 
story.) 
</P>
<P>
 The other races are: 
</P>
<P>
 20th Senate District: The race pits Herschel Rosenthal, 75, a Democratic 
senator who now represents a Latino-dominated district on the city's Eastside, 
and Dolores White, 59, a real estate broker who helped organize the 
unsuccessful recall election last spring against state Sen. David Roberti 
(D-Van Nuys). Rosenthal had been ready to retire this year rather than run in 
the unfamiliar 22nd District allotted to him by reapportionment. But Rosenthal 
was moved, he says, to run for the 20th District because he wanted to put his 
legislative experience to use helping San Fernando Valley residents with 
earthquake relief. White, a longtime GOP activist, calls Rosenthal a liberal 
carpetbagger. The seat is open because term limits have ended Roberti's long 
career in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 36th Assembly District: Assemblyman William J. (Pete) Knight (R-Palmdale), 63, 
a former Air Force test pilot, faces Democrat James Hutchins, 44, a technician 
at Northrop-Grumman Corp. Knight is seeking a second term after stumbling badly 
in his debut after it was revealed that he had distributed a derogatory poem 
about Latinos among lawmakers. He has fought to get economic development aid 
for his Antelope Valley-based district, which has been hurt by defense and 
aerospace industry cutbacks. But Hutchins has said Knight has a lackluster 
record of protecting the Antelope Valley from economic shocks and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 38th Assembly District: The race features an unusual matchup between 
Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills) and Democrat Josh Arce, a 
19-year-old UCLA student. Boland, 54, is expected to easily gain reelection to 
her last two-year term in office. Term limits will force her into retirement 
from the Assembly in 1996. Boland's current term has been dominated by her 
efforts (still unsuccessful) to dismantle the huge L.A. Unified School District 
and by the Jan. 17 earthquake. Acre calls his campaign "a grass-roots 
alternative to the high-cost, cynical campaigns of mainstream politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 39th Assembly District: Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) meets GOP 
challenger Nicholas Fitzgerald, 32, a computer technician. Katz, another victim 
of term limits, is seeking his last term in the Assembly. Katz, 44, has been 
one of Sacramento's most active legislators, and in 1993, when he ran for 
mayor, he demonstrated that his political ambitions ranged beyond Sacramento. 
The $64,000 question: What does Katz, who is expected to easily win reelection, 
do next? Fitzgerald says the incumbent is weak on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 40th Assembly District: The race has Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North 
Hollywood), 45, facing a challenge from Republican Noel DeGaetano, 51, a moving 
company franchise owner. Friedman has tried to stake out a claim as one of the 
Assembly's leading champions of women's causes, and it is unlikely that 
DeGaetano -- a nearly invisible challenger who predicted he would spend less 
than $1,000 on his campaign -- will interrupt her chosen legislative career 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 41st Assembly District: The race pits feminist law professor Sheila Kuehl, 53, 
the Democrat, against GOP candidate Michael Meehan, 28, a student at Loyola Law 
School and a reserve deputy sheriff. Kuehl's candidacy has attracted national 
media attention because her election would make her the state Legislature's 
first openly gay member. Kuehl has also capitalized on the Hollywood glitz 
factor: The candidate played Zelda Gilroy in the 1960s TV sitcom "The Many 
Loves of Dobie Gillis." Meanwhile, Meehan says Kuehl is too liberal. The 
district includes Encino, Tarzana and Woodland Hills, as well as Santa Monica 
and Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 42nd Assembly District: Democrat attorney Wallace Knox, 47, a community 
college trustee, meets Republican Robert Davis, 49, a West Hollywood swimming 
pool contractor. All the excitement left this race after the primary, in which 
seven Democrats, including four elected officials, scrambled for the prize of 
representing this affluent and heavily Democratic district. Knox won that 
primary by portraying himself as the candidate with the toughest anti-crime 
platform. The district, which includes Sherman Oaks, Beverly Hills and Bel-Air, 
is now represented by Assemblyman Burt Margolin, who must step down from his 
seat as the penalty for running in the June Democratic primary for state 
insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 44th Assembly District: The race pits Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) 
against Bruce Philpott, 50, a Democrat and the former chief of the Pasadena 
Police Department. Hoge, 48, a former insurance company executive who is 
seeking his second term in office, has earned a reputation in Sacramento for 
the volume of his "no" votes and for his ability to attract tens of thousands 
of dollars in campaign contributions from the gambling and horse racing 
industries. Philpott has failed to raise the kind of money normally needed to 
oust an incumbent, but his name identification as a member of the Pasadena 
police brass very likely will help him with voters. 
</P>
<P>
 25th Congressional District: Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) takes 
on attorney James Gilmartin, 60, the Democrat. The 53-year-old McKeon, wealthy 
owner of a chain of Western wear stores, is seeking his second term, while 
Gilmartin is making a second bid for Congress (he also ran against McKeon in 
1992). McKeon has been a reliable conservative vote in Congress and scored an 
early coup when he was elected president of the 51-member freshman GOP class in 
Congress. Gilmartin has spent much of his time trying to link McKeon to the 
troubles of a local bank. 
</P>
<P>
 26th Congressional District: Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) is 
challenged by Republican Gary Forsch, who manages his family owned hardware 
store and also ran in 1992 against Berman. Berman, the most active member of 
the political organization that bears his name and that of his colleague, Rep. 
Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles), is seeking his seventh term in Congress after 
disappointing his longtime labor union allies by voting for the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. Forsch has accused Berman of being far too liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 27th Congressional District: Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) faces 
Democrat Doug Kahn, owner of a small print shop. As the 72-year-old Moorhead 
seeks his 12th term in office, the Kahn campaign has criticized the incumbent 
for opposing abortion and gun control measures, including the provision to ban 
assault weapons contained in President Clinton's crime bill. Moorhead's team, 
meanwhile, has accused Kahn, 42, of being a newcomer to the district who 
appears to live on the proceeds of a large inheritance. In 1992, when Kahn also 
ran against Moorhead, the incumbent scored 49% of the vote -- enough to win, 
but still a dismal showing. 
</P>
<P>
 29th Congressional District: Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) meets 
33-year-old Pal Stepanek, a video production company owner. Stepanek would be a 
true giant-killer if he could defeat Waxman, 55, now seeking his 10th term, in 
a district where Democrats enjoy a 2-1 registration lead over Republicans and 
Waxman's name is political gold. But that's not likely to happen to the 
incumbent, who has made a reputation fighting the tobacco industry and seeking 
tougher environmental controls.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; ROGAN, SCHIFF PAINT SHARP CONTRASTS; ASSEMBLY: PORTRAITS 
OF INCUMBENT EMERGE, AS CHALLENGER TRIES TO BREAK GOP STRONGHOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A hotly contested Glendale-Burbank legislative race has produced some graphic 
portraits of freshman Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale), one drawn by the 
incumbent, the other by his Democratic foe, Adam Schiff. Not surprisingly, the 
pictures don't always seem to be of the same man. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan's own self-portrait, painted in quasi-heroic dimensions for voters, 
shows a young boy from a broken home (welfare mother, alcoholic stepfather) who 
overcame the odds to become a successful prosecuting attorney and one of the 
state's youngest Municipal Court judges. "Living the American dream" is the 
title Rogan's campaign literature gives to the incumbent's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff, 34, paints an equally vivid picture of Rogan, but as a former liberal 
foot soldier in the Democratic Party who later underwent an "amazing 
transformation" to become a hard-boiled, right-wing Christian who would have 
creationism taught in public schools and abortion outlawed. "Stop the radical 
right!" shouts a Schiff mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Which portrait will have the biggest impact on voters remains to be seen, as 
the region's most spirited Assembly race draws to a close. The 43rd District 
includes Glendale and Burbank as well as Los Feliz and Silver Lake and parts of 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 In its final days, the two contenders combined have pumped more than $650,000 
into a race where Democrats have launched their most ambitious challenge in 
decades to the longtime Republican hegemony in the Glendale-Burbank area. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats were encouraged to believe the time was ripe for an upset after the 
1992 elections showed President Clinton and U. S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and 
Barbara Boxer fared well in the 43rd District. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal agonies of former Assemblyman Pat Nolan also influenced Democratic 
calculations. Nolan pleaded guilty to one count of political corruption and was 
sent to prison in April, 1994, as part of a federal undercover probe of 
Sacramento lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Rogan handily won a special election to pick a replacement for the 
last few months of Nolan's term. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as he seeks his first full, two-year term representing the 43rd District, 
Rogan has focused on a triad of issues: crime, taxes and illegal immigration. 
Rogan is endorsed by Glendale and Burbank police officer groups and the 
leadership of the tax revolt movement, and he supports Proposition 187. (Schiff 
opposes the immigration initiative.) But Rogan has been unable to intimidate 
Schiff, a former federal prosecutor who has caught the eye of state Democratic 
Party talent scouts and received financial aid from Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown. As of last week, Schiff's campaign had gotten at least $12,500 from 
Brown's political organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff's receipt of Brown machine money, Rogan has claimed, assures that 
Schiff will be a typical Democratic loyalist in Sacramento, not the nonpartisan 
legislator he says he will be. Rogan has also accused Schiff of being an 
opportunistic job-shopper, citing the fact that his challenger ran in 1991 for 
a Hollywood-based Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such accusations, Schiff has brought to the table a crime-fighting 
record as a former federal prosecutor that has helped immunize him from many of 
the usual GOP attacks in an election year fraught with high voter concern about 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff has boasted that as prosecutor, he won a guilty verdict against FBI 
agent Richard Miller in 1990 in a highly publicized Soviet spying case, and 
that he scored a 100% jury trial conviction rate. He also notes that he 
supports a "three-strikes" law for persons convicted of a third violent felony 
and supports measures to ban assault weapons. Several law enforcement groups, 
including the Los Angeles Police Protective League and the Police Officers 
Research Assn. of California, are backing Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been Schiff's portrayal of Rogan that has been most provocative. 
"You'll see a great difference between the two of us," Schiff has warned 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, Schiff maintains, is the captive of the GOP's radical Christian right 
wing. Schiff has pointed to the fact that Rogan has received sizable 
contributions from Allied Business PAC, a political action committee run by 
several conservative Christian businessmen, including an heir to the Ahmanson 
savings and loan fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Allied and its individual members have contributed nearly $35,000 to Rogan, 
while San Fernando Valley businessman Bert Boeckman has loaned Rogan's campaign 
another $25,000. The owner of Galpin Motors, Boeckman has been affiliated with 
TV evangelist and ex-presidential candidate Pat Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff has called such contributions a "frightening development." 
</P>
<P>
 The blunt-spoken Rogan also gave Schiff further ammunition by acknowledging 
that he favored the idea of public school instructors teaching the theory of 
Biblical creationism (alongside evolutionary theory) as one explanation of the 
origins of mankind. 
</P>
<P>
 During a debate two weeks ago at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, Rogan 
-- pressed by Schiff to explain his views -- said he thought it would amount to 
"lying to school children" to teach them that it is a scientifically accepted 
fact that "we all came from monkeys." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff also has unveiled an obscure 14-year-old document to show how radically 
far Rogan has come in his personal and political pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
 The document was a mailer Rogan sent voters in 1980 when he was seeking to 
become a Democratic Party delegate supporting U. S. Sen. Edward Kennedy's 
insurgent candidacy to deny President Jimmy Carter renomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whither Rogan next?" Schiff said in an interview later, in which he claimed 
such dramatic shifts call into question the stability of his opponent's 
political beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff also has sharply challenged Rogan's decision to accept a $20,000-a-year 
pay hike that was recommended for all state legislators by a citizens panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Acceptance of the pay hike belied Rogan's carefully cultivated image as a tax 
fighter, Schiff said, and revealed him as a hypocrite because he had attacked 
his GOP foe in last May's special election, community college trustee Julia Wu, 
for similar behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan has not denied that he has traveled far politically, but calls his 
transformation the product of maturity that comes with a "receding hairline" 
and new family responsibilities, while denying his tough conservatism is the 
byproduct of his worship at Calvary Bible Church, a conservative denomination 
in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent candidate forum, Rogan said he thought it was not very remarkable 
that his political philosophy had changed since he was in law school (when he 
was supporting Edward Kennedy). Looking around the room, Rogan said he guessed 
others had also changed their views with time. "Maybe you'll be one of us 
someday, Mr. Schiff," Rogan added. 
</P>
<P>
 On the potentially damaging pay hike issue, Rogan has maintained that his 
acceptance of the pay hike and Wu's acceptance of one are dissimilar -- and 
thus it is unfair to knock him as a hypocrite. Wu voted to increase her own 
salary, Rogan noted, while all he did was accept a pay hike recommended by a 
citizens panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan has also sought to turn his acceptance of the pay hike into an emblem of 
the fact that he's a good family provider, while contrasting that image with 
that of bachelor Schiff. He took the pay, in part, because he has two children 
and a wife to support, Rogan angrily told an audience recently. "Before 
criticizing me for exercising my family responsibilities, perhaps you ought to 
get one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the issue of family values has crept into the debate, Schiff has sought to 
blunt its effects on him by actively displaying his girlfriend, Eve Sanderson, 
at candidate forums and in his campaign literature. In one piece, it is even 
announced beneath a photo of the two holding hands that they will be married 
Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rogan has complained that Schiff's tireless attacks on his ties to 
the Christian right amount to religious bigotry. In a handwritten letter to 
voters, Rogan's wife, Christine, likened Schiff to those who believed "John F. 
Kennedy wasn't qualified to be President because he was a Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
 After one forum, Rogan said: "I keep wanting to talk about the issues, but all 
he wants to do is talk about religion." But Schiff has retorted that Rogan's 
ties to the Christian right are relevant because his allies want to use the 
machinery of government to impose their views on the rest of society. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan denies that he is that kind of ideologue. "Creationism is not a 
legislative issue with me," he said in a recent interview. "It's only an issue 
in Adam Schiff's mind. You could go up to Sacramento and ask anyone, even 
Willie Brown, if I'm up there talking about creationism, and the answer will be 
'no.' Adam Schiff is just trying to distract the voters from the real issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan also tried to assure voters at a recent forum that he's not inflexible. 
While saying he wished he had the power to stop all abortions, he told the 
group that as a legislator he has voted for a measure to have the government 
pay for abortions for the poor in the case of rape, incest or threat to the 
mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
 When left to its own devices, however, the Rogan campaign tries to focus 
heavily on the incumbent's life story. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a young boy, Jim never knew his real father," says one mailer. "His 
stepfather was an alcoholic. His mother a convicted felon. He was raised by his 
grandparents." 
</P>
<P>
 The mailer goes on to relate how his family collected welfare, and how he 
dropped out of high school in the 10th grade to get odd jobs to help support 
his mother and his three half-brothers and a half-sister. After relating how 
Rogan got a law degree at UCLA, became a prosecutor and finally was appointed 
to the bench (by GOP Gov. George Deukmejian), the mailer ends with the rousing 
summation: "Judge Rogan's independence was forged in the crucible of hard work, 
grit and a belief that the American dream is open to anyone who is willing to 
stand on their own two feet." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim Rogan is a real Horatio Alger success story," said Laura Birkmeyer, an 
assistant chief U. S. Attorney in San Diego who has known Rogan and his family 
for 15 years.

PROP. 187'S QUIET STUDENT REVOLUTION; ACTIVISM: IN CONTRAST TO MORE PUBLICIZED 
WALKOUTS, LATINO YOUNGSTERS ARE TURNING OPPOSITION TO IMMIGRATION MEASURE INTO 
A REAL-LIFE CIVICS LESSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON D. MARKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the surface this week, student reaction to Proposition 187 erupted in 
noisy, sweaty school walkouts buzzed by television helicopters and blocked by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 But away from the din, a more meaningful morality play was under way. At many 
other schools, equally fervent but more organized students gathered peacefully 
to teach one another about the controversial ballot measure, which would deny a 
variety of state tax-supported benefits, including a free public education, to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando High School students held a seminar at a nearby junior high. 
Students at Roosevelt High School on the Eastside shunned the idea of walking 
out of class and staged a peaceful rally after school instead. At Chatsworth 
High, students held an assembly in favor of Proposition 187 attended by 200 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 For these students, Proposition 187 has become a real-life civics lesson, the 
first political issue to spark their imaginations, a banner that may become a 
generational turning point similar to the anti-war and civil rights movements. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some, I think it has taken them out of a form of youthful lethargy and 
gotten them to think about their lives and futures," said James Trent, a UCLA 
education professor who researches student activism. "It is democracy in 
action. They won't be the same anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Latino students -- who make up 68% of the Los Angeles Unified School District 
-- have largely been at the helm of the activities; for many, it is their first 
brush with the democratic system that their families came to this country to 
find. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the highly publicized walkouts, complete with chanting students 
waving foreign flags, have provoked derision among many voters, especially 
those who support Proposition 187 or are undecided about it, the more 
introspective debates and protests are more prosaic, even moving. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Panorama City, half a dozen San Fernando High student government and 
Chicano club leaders walked proudly into the office of Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar) to deliver petitions signed by students for and against Proposition 
187. He promised to send them to Gov. Wilson by overnight mail. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Reseda, students of Cleveland High's Latino Club researched and staged an 
elaborate daylong forum in their gymnasium where guest speakers spoke for and 
against the initiative, then answered questions from a respectful audience. 
</P>
<P>
 * Downtown, students at Belmont High made plans to walk precincts and staff 
telephone banks through Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation between San Fernando students and Katz revealed a glimpse of 
the pride and prejudice youths are grappling with. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a purple T-shirt and jeans, Araceli Recendez leaned urgently 
forward from a sofa in Katz's field office to tell him she was working against 
Proposition 187 "for my raza, my race." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Digarza, one of Recendez's compatriots in a campus chapter of the 
nationwide student group Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, echoed her 
sentiment -- explaining that he had helped persuade Pacoima Junior High 
children not to walk out of classes Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The younger kids are confused and full of rage," said Digarza, 17. "They were 
afraid that they weren't being heard. It's up to us to put them on our 
shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Digarza's and Recendez's concern appeared to be ignited by the perception of a 
threat to Latino families that goes beyond the specifics of Proposition 187. 
Instead, they expressed a fear that the initiative is aimed at their inclusion 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't realize that society would turn on us," said their classmate, 
Libertad M. Ayala, 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who wrote this initiative never counted on so many of you young 
people getting involved in politics in this way," Katz told the group of 
students, most of whom were talking to a politician for the first time. "You 
are learning a lot more about civics and government than you ever will from a 
book." 
</P>
<P>
 What did these voices of democracy sound like? At ground level, in classrooms 
and auditoriums across the city, they were loud but sometimes not so clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys High students flocked to an open microphone Friday during an all-day 
assembly attended by government classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I moved to L.A., I was so happy -- there were all kinds of different 
people," said Sharon Aviv, a junior. "Proposition 187 is against people loving 
their culture. It says you're American or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Behzad Jacob Faturechi, president of a Rush Limbaugh fan club at Van Nuys, 
which draws conservative students, said his friends felt intimidated by the 
fervor against Proposition 187, but he spoke out anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really gives an indication that the people of California don't want to 
provide services for people who aren't citizens," said Faturechi, who 
immigrated to the United States from Iran at age 8. "Mostly it's a first step 
toward dissolving the welfare state where people get things for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Students in favor of Proposition 187 had an easier time at Chatsworth High. 
Leaders of a peaceful anti-Proposition 187 rally held a week ago decided to 
attend a pro-Proposition 187 assembly Thursday to show that they respect 
diverse opinions.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Across town at Roosevelt High, students involved with the organization MEChA 
persuaded their peers to demonstrate their opposition to Proposition 187 after 
class, disdaining the showy walkouts they had seen on television. Even when a 
crowd marched to the campus from Shure High in Montebello, the students turned 
down the raucous invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Roosevelt government and economics teachers made the initiative a 
part of their curriculum for the day. After school, they marched to Soto and 
4th streets to chant their opposition in front of an Arco gas station and Vons 
supermarket, whose corporate organizations have contributed to Gov. Wilson's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 On campuses throughout the city, teachers found themselves acting as referees 
at assemblies and in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget your lesson plans!" Taft High Principal Ronald H. Berz said Wednesday 
during an impromptu faculty meeting. "It's healthy to discuss these issues in 
class tomorrow. The kids need to know that we are concerned about them and will 
not punish them for expressing their opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Leticia Quezada, who emigrated from Mexico at age 11, said 
she was seeking "an awakening process" similar to what she felt as a college 
student during MEChA protests at UC Santa Cruz two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chancellor told me: 'Young lady, you should devote yourself to academics, 
and not to politics.' And one of these days I'm going to tell him that politics 
is my life, and became a part of my life as a result of those protests." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel G. Solorzano, a UCLA professor specializing in minority education, 
considers the Chicano Movement of the late 1960s the watershed event of his 
life and remembers how high school children involved in the Eastside "blowouts" 
of 1968 and 1969 -- protests against inferior educational conditions for 
Chicanos -- went on to become student leaders at Cal State L.A., UCLA and USC. 
Will it happen again? 
</P>
<P>
 "I look forward to meeting (the current generation of activists) on this 
campus," he said. "I get excited with students challenging me. These events can 
be real catalyzing, and it's always for the best."

VALLEY BRIEFING: THE FIRST GOLD RUSH; BEFORE SUTTER'S MILL, SANTA CLARITA WAS 
THE HOME OF GOLD FEVER IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1842, Francisco Lopez was inspecting cattle and hunting for game with two 
men in the lower end of what is now called Placerita Canyon in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. They stopped for lunch under a large, oddly shaped tree next to 
a river bank, the story goes, where Lopez napped and dreamed he was floating in 
a pool of liquid gold. 
</P>
<P>
 When he woke up, Lopez began digging at some nearby wild onions with his 
sheath knife and he spotted a bit of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 This time it wasn't a dream. Lopez's discovery sparked California's first gold 
rush, six years before the far more famous discovery of the metal at Sutter's 
Mill, 400 miles north. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of prospectors streamed into the Santa Clarita area to try their 
luck. During the boom years -- from the discovery in 1842 until 1847 when the 
area seemed almost mined out -- an average of about 260 pounds of the metal 
annually was taken from the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold mining is now prohibited in the canyon and experts say they believe there 
isn't much left anyway. But the tree where Lopez reportedly had his golden nap 
is still there. Now called "The Oak of The Golden Dream," it's at the site of 
the Placerita Canyon Nature Center. Modern-day Panning 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Hardware in Santa Clarita sells about 100 pans a year to modern-day, 
recreational gold prospectors. 
</P>
<P>
 More serious prospectors looking to extract what gold might be left in dry 
creek beds and hillsides invest in a dry washer, a contraption that looks like 
a giant vacuum with two bins attached above. 
</P>
<P>
 A hand-cranked dry washer about four-feet high costs $350 at Keene Engineering 
Co. in Northridge; with motor it costs $495. Gold Rises 
</P>
<P>
 Gold in its molten form exists 100 to 150 miles below the surface of the 
Earth. It rises, usually because of plate tectonic activity, with other 
elements and hardens. Some bits of gold make it all the way to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the prospectors found it, mostly by panning in riverbeds. 
Commercial Mining 
</P>
<P>
 No productive commercial gold mines operate in the area today, according to 
Russell Miller, a senior geologist with the California Department of 
Conservation's division of mines and geology. But there was commercial mining 
in the Santa Clarita Valley until the 1930s. In the nearby Acton/Agua Dulce 
area, there were also commercial operations at the Red Rover and New York 
mines. Recent Find 
</P>
<P>
 Most modern day prospectors are lucky to find even small pieces of gold. But a 
Mojave resident who took to gold mining last year as a way to kill time while 
recovering from a lung infection, showed that while you might not get rich off 
local mining, you can still find a nice hunk of the metal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Gates uncovered a 12.8-ounce, 23-carat nugget in mid-June, 1993, after 
three months of mining at a random spot on public land near Acton. He used a 
shovel and an $800 hot-air dry washer to uncover the nugget, valued at $6,500.

ELECTION '94; 29TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), 55, has been a member of Congress 
since 1974. He is married and has two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican challenger Paul Stepanek, 33, owns a video production company. He 
and his wife live in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman is the quieter half of the well-known political machine named for him 
and U.S. Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). Blessed with one of the 
nation's most affluent and influential constituencies (the 29th District 
includes Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Sherman Oaks), Waxman can help open 
entertainment industry doors for candidates seeking Hollywood's cachet and 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman is one of the nation's top advocates for stronger health and 
environmental protections. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman of a House subcommittee on health, Waxman held highly publicized 
hearings this year to determine if the tobacco industry manipulates cigarette 
ingredients in order to hook consumers. The panel's findings are likely to play 
a key role in anti-smoking movement efforts to have tobacco declared a drug and 
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent has also sponsored a federal law to ban smoking in public 
places, and he has fought to strengthen federal controls over health claims 
made by the nation's huge vitamin and dietary supplement industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Waxman urged a sweeping federal review of the Metro Rail subway 
program amid growing revelations of shoddy construction. Within days, federal 
transit officials ordered an audit and froze federal Metro Rail funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepanek sharply disagrees with the incumbent's health agenda. "I don't 
personally believe tobacco is a drug and I don't believe in regulation that 
would make it a drug," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Stepanek, once a professional GOP fund-raiser, says the health-care 
proposals that Waxman favors would be too costly. Although he co-authored a 
1992 single-payer health-care plan, Waxman has more recently sponsored the less 
ambitious Clinton health-care package. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration in this district is 58% Democratic, 27% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running is Libertarian Michael Binkley, a software engineer from 
Westwood. JOHN SCHWADA

STATE HUMANE GROUP SEEKS TO TIGHTEN REQUIREMENTS FOR OFFICERS; LEGISLATION: A 
NEW REGULATION THAT GOES INTO EFFECT JAN. 1 WILL REQUIRE MORE TRAINING, BUT 
SOME REMAIN CONCERNED THAT IT DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As crisply dressed officers bustle in and out of the sprawling Marin Humane 
Society headquarters, Rick Johnson makes his way through kennels filled with 
yapping dogs and into the main auditorium where the lectures are given. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here, in this cavernous room, where California's humane officers can 
choose to go for advanced training in such subjects as peace officer ethics, 
evidence collection and preservation, crime scene photography and the 
preparation and execution of search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a place, in effect, where humane officers charged with protecting 
animals from abuse and neglect learn how to be the sworn peace officers they 
already are. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a spacious library, exhibits depicting the history of humane officers 
and the animals they safeguard and a visitors center so the public can learn 
about these little-known agents of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to know what we are out there doing: trying to make it a 
better world for animals," said Johnson, who is president of the State Humane 
Assn. of California as well as a top official in the Marin Humane Society. 
"That ethic underlies everything we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, attendance at the modern center is not mandatory under the state 
laws that give humane officers their broad range of powers. Many officers, 
Johnson complained, never come here or to a similar site in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Although humane officers can conduct criminal investigations and make arrests 
where animals are concerned, many do not have the most rudimentary training in 
law and police procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 To be a humane officer is a complicated task; humane laws cross a huge 
spectrum of criminal and civil codes, and it takes a 343-page book to explain 
all the applicable state statutes, not to mention all the laws of each county. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Jan. 1, California's humane officers will be required to take 20 hours 
of training in animal care and at least 40 hours of training in state laws at 
accredited post-secondary institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson wishes more could be done to regulate humane officers. "Training 
is imperative if you are to use weapons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the state association, a private organization that led the effort last 
year to move the Legislature to strengthen the requirements, is considering 
proposing a measure to require monitoring boards in each county. Now, the 
presiding judge of the Superior Court in each county is charged with reviewing 
all applicants for humane officers within their jurisdiction before approving 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 That system is outdated, said Johnson, contending that the judges usually 
rubber-stamp the applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the case in Los Angeles County, where officials say they simply send 
the forms to the state Department of Justice in Sacramento so fingerprints can 
be checked to see if the applicant has a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no indication that judges conduct any investigation beyond the 
fingerprint check, nothing to equal the exhaustive background and psychological 
examinations to which applicants for most police and sheriff's departments are 
subjected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their calendars are jampacked," Johnson said. "Their priorities are 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Sakach, a Sacramento-based investigator with the Humane Society of the 
United States, also said improvements are needed. But like Johnson, he said 
most humane officers are well-trained and well-behaved in upholding the laws, 
and that many other states are also upgrading their requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one keeps statistics on the number of humane officers in the 
state, Sakach estimated that half of those in California carry firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 A slender man with the calm demeanor of a country doctor, Johnson, 46, 
grimaces when he hears tales of wayward humane officers overstepping the bounds 
of their authority. Although his group has no control over the officers, it 
spends a good portion of its budget trying to provide better training. 
</P>
<P>
 Most problems, Johnson said, occur in large urban areas where police 
departments are too large to notice a few renegade humane officers running 
around in their uniforms. Most places, he said, "really don't have a problem 
with these Scud missiles like L.A. does." 
</P>
<P>
 And most humane officers, he said, not only do their job well and diligently, 
but serve an invaluable function at a time when their counterparts in state and 
local police departments are too busy with murders and rapes to keep a watchful 
eye on animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Most humane officers, according to Johnson and others, work closely with 
police rather than on their own, and present evidence of criminal conduct to 
local prosecutors. Marin Humane Society officers work for many small localities 
on a contract basis. They have a state-of-the-art darkroom to print the 
photographs they use as evidence, and they usually bring a video camera when on 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that humane officers are not required to go there for 
training, the Marin County site bustles with activity. Humane officers from 
around the state come and go, and many return every few years to brush up their 
skills, Johnson said.

DOCUMENT-FORGING RING RAIDED, 3 HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of phony documents were seized and three people were arrested in 
Canoga Park on Saturday in connection with what authorities said is a major 
counterfeiting ring that manufactures fake driver's licenses, immigration cards 
and other official papers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth time in two years that undercover Los Angeles police officers 
and state investigators busted counterfeiters selling documents in a parking 
lot at the same intersection on Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers followed the suspects from the parking lot to a nearby apartment 
that served as a "paper mill," where the phony documents were assembled. 
Investigators confiscated a laminating machine, a typewriter with different 
daisy wheels, a paper cutter and hundreds of blank birth certificates and other 
documents from the two-bedroom apartment in the 6900 block of Millwood Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators said they believe the ringleaders are still at large because 
the printing press on which the documents were manufactured was not among the 
equipment seized. 
</P>
<P>
 The ring -- operating out of Canoga Park because of the high concentration of 
immigrants -- was netting thousands of dollars a week, investigators said.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators identified two suspects but said the men used counterfeit 
documents to identify themselves. The third suspect was identified as Alonso 
Yerena, 29, from Mexicali, who told police that he is a naturalized citizen 
from Mexico whose documents were stolen in Miami. All three were arrested on 
suspicion of felony forgery and were being held at Van Nuys jail in lieu of 
$10,000 bail each. If convicted, they could face up to a year in prison.

PIT BULL KILLED BABY ABANDONED IN POMONA BACK YARD, AUTHORITIES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A newborn baby boy whose mutilated body was found in the back yard of a Pomona 
home was apparently mauled to death by a pit bull dog kept in the yard, police 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona police had speculated earlier that the infant was killed elsewhere 
before being dumped Friday near a rusting car in the littered yard of a 
working-class neighborhood home. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Orange Grove Avenue discovered the body Friday afternoon. Police 
said the body showed evidence of head injuries as well as severed testicles and 
a missing arm. 
</P>
<P>
 But an autopsy Saturday indicated that the infant died "as a result of trauma 
caused by multiple dog bites," Police Sgt. Jeff Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the infant is possibly Latino. They have requested help from 
the public in identifying him.

COUNTY REGISTRAR'S POLLING PLACE LETS VOTERS GET HEAD START ON ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It would be another 70 hours before her neighborhood polling place opened. 
</P>
<P>
 That explains why Trudy Edwards traveled across town Saturday to cast one of 
the first ballots in Tuesday's general election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westside resident was standing in a voting booth in Norwalk, carefully 
checking over her ballot before dropping it into a gray ballot box. A line of 
other voters waited their turn behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 They were among dozens taking advantage of an early bird balloting service 
that is being offered by the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder's office 
through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just found out we're going to be out of town on Election Day," said 
Edwards, a realty agent who was accompanied her husband, Fred. "I'm glad they 
have this: I came from East Germany, where you didn't have as many rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The walk-in voting process uses absentee ballots. Early voters have been 
welcome at the elections headquarters at 12400 Imperial Highway since Oct. 12, 
the day those ballots became available, according to clerk Othenia Gage. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Saturday, however, only a trickle of voters -- about 300 in all -- had 
come in. There are 3,603,562 registered voters in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect a rush today and Monday when voters realize it's too late to 
return absentee ballots by mail. Or when they belatedly discover they won't be 
able to vote Tuesday at their neighborhood polling place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to go back to Rochester, N.Y., because of a family illness," said John 
Karle, an engineer who lives in Long Beach. "I was afraid I wouldn't be able to 
vote until I heard about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier resident Beth Camarco decided to vote early because she worried that 
she might not get home from work in time to cast her ballot Tuesday. She is a 
Los Angeles Police Department analyst who car-pools with several police 
officers who may be ordered to work late on Election Day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputies Larry Gregg and Dean Miller -- who live about a block apart 
in Santa Clarita -- traveled 50 miles to vote because they have already been 
scheduled to work Election Day. In fact, they'll be working on the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be out doing things like fixing ballot machines. But we'll be on from 
about 5:30 in the morning until 8 that night and we won't have time to vote," 
Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Quiroz, a carpenters' union official from Redondo Beach, said he is 
flying to Philadelphia on union business Monday. "I feel my vote is important 
because not enough other people bother to vote. You can bet I'll be watching 
the election results very closely back in Philadelphia," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona residents Michele and Abel Llamas waited in line with their 3-year-old 
son, Rick, because they recently moved from Whittier and hadn't changed their 
voting address. "We weren't sure we could get back there on Tuesday," said Abel 
Llamas, a grocery warehouseman. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's voters weren't worried that candidates' last-minute advertising 
blitzes -- or smear campaigns -- would make them wish they had waited to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "If any last-minute 'bombshells' come out it will be too late," said Jose 
Blas, a guitar-maker from Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxanne Story, an office manager from Redondo Beach, said: "My mind is made 
up. I'll toss any campaign material that comes in after this." 
</P>
<P>
 The early voters also got to try out new prototype voting booths that the 
county hopes will some day replace familiar canvas and wood booths. The new 
ones are made of lightweight plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Registrar-Recorder spokeswoman Grace Romero said walk-in voting will be 
available from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. today and Monday at the Norwalk 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The 479,341 absentee ballots that her office mailed out must be received by 8 
p.m. Tuesday. If they are not mailed back, they can be turned in at any county 
polling place on Election Day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 County residents can vote early, but they can't vote often, according to 
Romero. Cross-checking will allow officials to absolutely catch voters who cast 
an absentee ballot and a regular one, she said.

BUSINESSMAN FETED FOR VOLUNTEERISM; COMMUNITY: MAYOR RICHARD RIORDAN PRESENTS 
THE FERNANDO AWARD TO WOODLAND HILLS PHILANTHROPIST CLYDE PORTER, 68. HE HAS 
BEEN NOMINATED THREE TIMES.

<P>
 The third time was the charm for Clyde Porter, a Woodland Hills businessman 
who took home the San Fernando Valley's top award for volunteerism Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 After being nominated three times for the Fernando Award, the 68-year-old 
philanthropist and chief executive officer of P. L. Porter Co. in Woodland 
Hills received the honor at a banquet at the Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan presented the 36th annual award to Porter, who is 
well-known for his financial support of community concerts at Warner Park, as 
well as his service to Pierce College, the Woodland Hills Rotary Club and Haven 
Hills, a center for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Porter said he grew up unaccustomed to being recognized for his 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter, who took over his father's airline chair manufacturing business, said 
"This seems to be an overkill, in terms of getting this award." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was indeed an honor to be considered among the larger group as a whole," 
he added, "but most of us doing community service do it out of the enjoyment of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also nominated for the award were Ed Davis, a former chief of the Los Angeles 
Police Department and former state senator from Santa Clarita; Benjamin Reznik, 
who spearheaded the earthquake recovery task force of the Valley Industry and 
Commerce Assn.; Terry York, an Encino automobile dealer and community 
benefactor, and Kenneth Banks, a North Hollywood community and civic leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The prestigious Fernando Award annually honors an individual who has compiled 
a record of outstanding and selfless community service in the Valley. There is 
no cash prize; the winners' names are inscribed on a statue in the Van Nuys 
Civic Center Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For an encore, Porter said he would attempt to raise $2 million next year for 
the Valley Cultural Center. But he said he is not looking for any more awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "All told I seem to have some 40 or so different awards of plaques," he said. 
"It gets to be overwhelming. I'd like to go into hiding."

NO MIDDLE-OF-ROAD PRAISE FOR MEDIAN; LAWNDALE: SWATCH OF WEATHERED ASTROTURF 
INSTALLED NEARLY 25 YEARS AGO ALONG HAWTHORNE BOULEVARD HAS BECOME A CIVIC JOKE 
TO SOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SWEET, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the entrance of his Lawndale furniture store, Bill Henderson can see what 
has been lampooned by some as a civic joke and derided by others as a civic 
tragedy -- a swatch of worn, weathered Astroturf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks crummy," Henderson said of the dreary artificial lawn that carpets 
the median of Hawthorne Boulevard in front of his store. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawndale -- called "Astrodale" by some -- is a city divided. 
</P>
<P>
 On the northern half of Hawthorne Boulevard, the median is landscaped with 
grass and boulders, Italian cypress and eucalyptus trees. But south of the San 
Diego Freeway, a different spectacle unfolds: balding, faded plastic grass, 
littered with cigarette butts, discarded gum, wrappers and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
 A year after the United States put a man on the moon, Lawndale carpeted the 
median of its entire strip of Hawthorne Boulevard -- also known as State 
Highway 107 -- with Astroturf. The idea was to save the city maintenance costs, 
the same reason a number of baseball and football stadiums installed the fake 
grass around the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 But once it became obvious the turf served as a magnet for litter, the city 
had to invest in vacuum cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, the City Council decided to landscape anew the medians at 
Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Marine Avenue. Now, with the remainder of the 
Astroturf nearly 25 years old, the council has asked the state to give up 
control of Lawndale's section of the highway -- a decision that may hasten 
removal of the remaining Astroturf. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans, which is responsible for the road, is agreeable. But before Caltrans 
can transfer authority over the roadway, state law requires that the agency 
restore it to a good state of repair.  
</P>
<P>
 Would this include removal of the Astroturf?  
</P>
<P>
 "It's negotiable," said Russ Snyder, a Caltrans spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lawndale covered the median -- which once served as a trolley route, 
bridle path and drainage ditch -- with Astroturf in 1970, the product's 
manufacturer, Monsanto Co., gave the city a plaque. Below a strip of Astroturf, 
the citation read: "World's First Astro Grass Traffic Median Installation." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1984, the color had faded, so the city tried to paint the Astroturf green 
in preparation for the carrying of the Olympic torch through the city. 
Aquamarine ground cover resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Harold Hofmann can't remember the last time the city -- which is paid by 
Caltrans to maintain the highway -- vacuumed the Astroturf. Five years ago, he 
recalled, workers used fire hoses to wash away the trash that had accumulated 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, much of the plastic grass has snapped off. All that's left are the 
circular nubs that once held it.

IN SOME TOWNS, IT'S HARD TO FIND CANDIDATES; NORTH COUNTY: RESIDENTS OF FOUR

 Don't look for town council election results from Acton, Agua Dulce, Lake Los 
Angeles or Littlerock on television Tuesday night. In fact, don't even look for 
the races on the official county ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 These sparsely populated communities in north Los Angeles County are not 
incorporated cities, and their town council members are local volunteers, not 
seasoned politicians. To vote in these elections, residents must pick up 
ballots at advertised locations, usually close to official county voting 
booths. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite representing such remote areas, however, town council members say they 
serve an important role by advising county officials on development issues and 
safety concerns in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Ferrier, a member of the Castaic Town Council, said county planners now 
routinely urge builders to run their proposals past a town council before they 
reach the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. "We do have some influence," 
Ferrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven unincorporated communities in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys 
have town councils. The first, in Acton, was founded in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the communities were originally scheduled to poll their residents 
Tuesday, but only four will, after two of the towns, Antelope Acres and Green 
Valley, postponed their elections for lack of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had much response," said Roy Rizk, a member of the Green Valley 
Town Council. "At the next meeting we're going to look at what to do. We have 
to look at the bylaws and see if people can be appointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the four communities conducting elections Tuesday can vote during 
regular voting hours, from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., at publicized locations. Most are 
near regular polling places. Only registered voters from the community can cast 
ballots for their town council. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition in these races varies. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight candidates will compete for four two-year terms Tuesday on the Acton 
Town Council. A ninth candidate -- activist Charles Brink -- was eliminated in 
a legal dispute that was recently decided in a Lancaster courtroom. Brink 
contends that he is a legal resident of Acton, but local opponents argued 
successfully that his true home is in the San Fernando Vallley. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ballot are Laurie Browning, Steve Browning, Victor W. Conklin, Tom 
Haile, Ruthanne Hileman, Richard Morris, Jeffrey C. Wadsworth and Gerry 
Williams. Morris and Williams are incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Agua Dulce, six candidates are running for three seats: Art Brewer, 
Nolan Henderson, James O'Keefe, Darrell Readmond, Al Shaver and Lianne Swanson. 
Henderson and Readmond are incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 The key issue in the Acton and Agua Dulce races has been how to retain the 
communities' rural character and keep dense development out. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to these races, there is little competition for town council seats 
in Littlerock and Lake Los Angeles, two rural towns east of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lake Los Angeles, four candidates are running uncontested for four seats. 
They are incumbent Frank Donaldson, Robert Keys, Donald Blanton and Robert 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, residents were also asked to consider a name change for the 
community, and Desert Buttes appeared to be the winner. But local leaders 
decided the vote was only advisory, and the name change has not been made 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 In Littlerock, two seats are at stake but only one candidate -- Jason Zink -- 
is on the ballot. Dennis Tetu, vice president of the Littlerock Town Council, 
said that if the election does not yield a write-in candidate, the council will 
probably appoint someone to the second seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Littlerock residents also will vote on a proposed Community Standards 
District, which would allow the county to impose strict development rules aimed 
at preserving the town's rural character.

DANA PARSONS: REAL-LIFE TRAGEDIES DEEPEN EMPTINESS OF ELECTION SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It'll be dark by the time I vote Tuesday. Behind the curtain, I'll punch my 
ballot and wait for the light emitted by my wisdom to illuminate the 
countryside for miles and miles. Failing that, I'll settle for the consolation 
of thinking that voting inches the republic forward. Multiply my act by 
millions of others around the country, by Jove, and look how far we will have 
advanced in a single day! 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back on Planet Earth . . . Another voice in my head will confront 
the folly of it all. It will ask me to relate the inanity of the political 
season to what's really wrong with the country. It will ask me to make the 
connection between $25-million campaigns and the bargain-basement realities of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as, you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as a mother in South Carolina who confesses to killing her two young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as the Orange County boy who tried to kill himself last week in class 
because his puppy-love relationship had soured. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as the two Chicago boys who pushed a 5-year-old out a window to his death 
because he wouldn't steal candy for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't you love to see something on the ballot that would let you get at any 
of those problems? Instead, we've had to listen for months to how immigrants 
are ruining California and how the tobacco industry has been treated unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
 When human tragedies are occurring on a weekly basis, are we supposed to take 
seriously a candidate whose election-season mantra runs no deeper than 
"government is the problem" or "I'll cut your taxes"? 
</P>
<P>
 Go ahead, pal, get government out of my life and cut my taxes. I won't stop 
you. But after doing that, would you mind terribly devoting a bit of your 
immense egotism and energy to what's really wrong with the country? Somehow, I 
don't think an extra 10 or 20 bucks in my pocket per paycheck is going to turn 
this thing around. 
</P>
<P>
 I shouldn't think aloud like this, because, believe me, I'm not putting out a 
call for the "family values" cavalry. To paraphrase whoever said it, if Pat 
Robertson is the answer, I don't want to know the question. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, even as most thinking citizens have an instinctive feeling that 
family breakdowns are a big part of our social problems, they also know that 
just declaring one's self a "family values" candidate falls somewhat short of 
the mark. Just what do you mean, sir or madam? If your inkling is that reciting 
a prayer in school every morning will get us back on the straight and narrow, 
I'm afraid I'm going to need a little more than that from you. 
</P>
<P>
 The emptiness of the election season deepens as the days shorten. While these 
stories of human tragedy swirl around us, the candidates act almost as mocking 
disclaimants that anything out of the ordinary is actually occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 While hearing one minute that a mother would let her two sons drown, a 
candidate's ad talks about his or her opponent being in the pocket of 
lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 While preteen boys commit murder and think nothing of it, candidates talk 
about whether their opponent filed tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 While a teen-age boy goes home, brings a gun to school and then shoots himself 
in front of his classmates, candidates argue over which of them is more 
condemnable for hiring illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 It can't be that the candidates don't hear the noises around them. It can't be 
that they don't see TV or read the papers. You have to assume they know what's 
going on in their society. Not to name names, but how can someone spend $25 
million to get elected and have as their solution to today's problems that 
people eschew government and do more volunteer work? 
</P>
<P>
 For $25 million, I at least want some screwball ideas. If I want 
sophomore-in-high-school ideas, I sure wouldn't spend 25 million for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere out there, someone thinking about running for office in some distant 
millennium must really hear the heartbeat of the society. Someone must know the 
drum the candidates are banging is way out of rhythm. Someone must see the gap 
between what they're saying and what is happening around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are they? Why can't we find them? Why can't we do better than this? 
</P>
<P>
 Why in California were we left with a governor's race dominated by immigration 
and the death penalty and a U.S. Senate race dominated by whose money would 
stretch the farthest? 
</P>
<P>
 I guess you could call this an election season lament. Pardon my darkness, but 
take heart in knowing that it'll only last through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Once back in the light on Wednesday morning, I'll forget completely for 
another couple years how much false hope I bring to the ballot box.

 Park preview--Early birds will get an appetizing treat for the senses at the 
sneak preview of Wagon Wheel Wilderness Park in Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
 The predominantly oak woodland park is scheduled to open to the public in 
December, but through South Coast Audubon, anyone interested can take a guided 
tour Saturday at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The 475-acre wilderness park was designed to have a natural look and will 
offer only a few recreational facilities, buildings, picnic tables and paved 
roads.No facilities will be available during Saturday's walk. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour will begin with a naturalist explaining the flora and fauna of the 
area. Participants will hike into the park via trails that meander through 
canyons and valleys. Along the way, birds, animals and plants of interest will 
be pointed out and identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants can expect to see a variety of wildlife, including deer, rabbits, 
gray squirrels, spotted woodpeckers and red-tailed hawks. This is an excellent 
time for birding, as many migratory species are currently in the county. In 
addition, seven pairs of nesting gnatcatchers were sighted at the park this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants should bring binoculars, a bird book and water and should wear 
sturdy yet comfortable shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The park does not currently have adequate parking space for the number of cars 
anticipated for Saturday's event. Interested parties are asked to meet at the 
shopping center on the northeast corner of Oso and Marguerite parkways, near 
Pavilions. Groups will car-pool from that point to the park entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Audubon asks that participants be on time, as the car pool to the 
park will begin promptly at 8 a.m. Once everyone is inside the park, the gates 
will be locked and latecomers will not be admitted.

NO NEED FOR HASTY DECISION ON AIRPORT; THE PUBLIC IS RIGHTFULLY CONFUSED ABOUT 
MEASURE A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent days, it has become clearer that there is a division between a 
select group of special interest people who want to pull out all the stops for 
an airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station and much of the public, which is 
far more prudent by nature.  
</P>
<P>
 And what it comes down to is this: The public's confusion over Measure A, as 
evidenced in a recent Times Orange County poll, is understandable and 
instructive. The initiative calls for a commercial airport at El Toro and would 
close off discussion of alternative uses for the last remaining large parcel of 
open space in the county. What the public seems to be saying, and correctly so, 
is that it is much too early to be doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, money from development interests has flooded the pro-Measure 
A campaign in a desperate attempt to pump up support of the initiative and 
create a false sense of urgency. Advocates say they want an airport for the 
future, and that the decision absolutely must be made now. But that is not the 
case. The rush to judgment is an artificially constructed predicament set 
against an unnecessarily hasty deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is understandably reluctant to commit heart and soul to the dream 
of a few movers and shakers before all the information is in. A Times Orange 
County Poll published a week ago found that the public still can't decide on 
this issue. Supporters and opponents were almost dead even, and most important, 
there was a substantial portion of the electorate that was undecided. While a 
large number of people say an airport would create jobs and improve the 
economy, there were fewer than 25% who thought for certain that a commercial 
airport would be the most fiscally sound use of the base, and that it would 
cost taxpayers less to develop and will generate more tax revenues than other 
possible future uses.  
</P>
<P>
 What this ought to suggest is what we have been saying all along. An airport 
well may be a good idea for El Toro, but we do not know enough at this point 
about it to commit to it, and we do not know whether it is the best possible 
use for the base. Accordingly, people seem to be resisting jumping to the 
conclusion that they should rule out other possibilities. And they shouldn't 
have to. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is right if it does not want to close the door just yet on future 
discussion of uses for the base. That is especially understandable, and it is 
especially wise when one stops to consider that waiting to make a decision on 
the base will allow all options, including an airport, to be explored 
thoroughly. The way to deal with that set of circumstances is to vote "no" on 
Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been one thing if the community was forced to make a fast 
decision on the base after the Defense Department had decided to close. But the 
length of time left until the base is turned over to the community gives the 
local community the luxury of deliberation. The proponents of Measure A want 
Orange County to forfeit this advantage to preclude other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 What voters need to understand on Tuesday, is that a "no" vote on Measure A 
does not rule out the possibility of using El Toro as an airport, or as 
anything else for that matter.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even those who believe now that an airport is best still would be wise 
to vote "no" on Measure A. That way, the planning group now in place, which 
only recently has begun to do its work, can be given full play to assess the 
cost.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's not preclude the possibility of other choices, and let's explore the 
many questions that voters seem to have about the cost and benefits of the 
airport idea.

THE WRONG BIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: "Nature's Open House" (Oct. 30): (You) did an excellent job of reporting 
on the open house at Audubon's Starr Ranch.However, (you) did err in describing 
the birds in the sanctuary. Any birder knows there are no blue jays in the 
sanctuary as reported. True, there are jays there that are blue, but blue jays 
they're not. They are scrub jays. The bird called the blue jay is an eastern 
bird not found west of the Rocky Mountains.

IT'S NOT ORANGE COUNTY POLITICS AS USUAL; CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM FORCES 
SUPERVISORIAL HOPEFULS TO REACH OUT TO MORE VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The race for the 2nd Supervisorial District in Orange County is proving to be 
an object lesson in the effects of recent campaign finance reform. The county's 
1992 campaign reforms limited individual contributions to $1,000 per candidate 
for every election cycle.  
</P>
<P>
 In past supervisorial races, candidates built up huge war chests and this time 
they are still substantial, but not as much as in 1986, when last there was an 
open supervisorial seat. In that election, the two top candidates spent a 
combined total of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign officials recently said that Linda Moulton Patterson, the mayor of 
Huntington Beach, had raised about $268,000 for the primary and general 
election races, and Jim Silva, a Huntington Beach city councilman, had raised 
$260,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are nearly equal in dollar amounts, and they have a lesser total 
overall than the candidates did in 1986. But there is a larger change evident 
in this election. Supporters and opponents of campaign reform seem to agree 
that the way these campaigns are being financed is very different because of 
the new spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
 That necessarily has to be a good thing for the public. The result seems to be 
more time spent on public debates and community forums to reach voters, and 
less on expensive mailers. No wonder William R. Mitchell, chairman of the 
Orange County Common Cause political watchdog group says: "This is how 
campaigns should be run." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees that what is happening is a good thing. Political 
consultants on both sides of the supervisorial race have lamented the 
additional burden it has put on their campaigns to get their message out.  
</P>
<P>
 However, it must be clear that the public is well served by the idea of 
spreading the money base out, and of not having special interests dominating 
the landscape as sources of funds. While developers and other special interests 
are still players, their contributions are limited, and that must contribute to 
the perception of a sense of obligation to a broader group of supporters.  
</P>
<P>
 The consultants don't like it; they have to work harder to get to the same 
places. The candidates have to spend more time trying to raise money. But the 
sense of allegiances that the candidates feel is what's most important. This 
reform takes it largely out of the hands of a few wealthy special-interest 
groups. And who better to owe than a broad constituency of ordinary citizens, 
the very people elected officials are supposed to serve?

PROP. 188 AN INDUSTRY SMOKE SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 188 is being misrepresented by Philip Morris and other tobacco 
companies as a strong smoking control law. The truth is, this initiative would 
replace Orange County's well supported and hard fought smoke-free ordinances 
with a weak state law that would pose a serious threat to our health and well 
being. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Proposition 188: 
</P>
<P>
 * Allows smoking in restaurants, hotels, sports facilities, workplaces and 
other public places, exposing millions of Orange County residents to toxic 
environmental tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preempts local policy makers from passing ordinances that are stronger than 
the weak provisions of the Prop. 188 initiative. This would inhibit local 
policy makers from adequately protecting the health and safety of their 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 * Repeals existing local smoking control ordinances such as those passed last 
year by the city councils of Laguna Hills, Huntington Beach, Dana Point, Laguna 
Beach, San Juan Capistrano and Santa Ana. Prop. 188 would also repeal AB13, a 
strong state law designed to protect the public's health and safety from 
environmental tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 It enrages me that people are being mislead into voting for Proposition 188 
believing that it will provide protection from the harmful effects of 
environmental tobacco smoke. The fact remains, this proposition is sponsored by 
the tobacco companies and do you really think that they are concerned with our 
health? Consider your vote carefully or our hopes for a healthier California 
will go up in smoke.

THE REAL AGENDAS OF BOARD CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Within an article that was written about the Education Alliance 
("Conservatives Take Best Shot at School Boards," Oct. 30) I was mentioned, 
giving the apparentness that I was part of an "extremist group" when in fact I 
don't know anyone else supported by the Education Alliance and their respective 
views. 
</P>
<P>
 My first disagreement with your newspaper stems from this attitude: Somebody 
else said it, a staff writer wrote it, but they are not responsible for what 
they wrote. My second disagreement is an attempt to group me and the Education 
Alliance by association to a very general statement: "Their whole mission and 
purpose is anti-public education." So where is the real investigative 
reporting? 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody in the press asked me why I am running, but they did not hesitate to 
call me a radical or an extremist, simply because I decided to become more 
responsible to my community and my children. When I made the decision to run, 
no one asked me to run. It was only after several months of observing a 
rubber-stamp board that I knew I had to do something because of my children. It 
may be a bit boring in terms of how it came about (no beams of lights, or 
disembodied voices telling me to run) but it sure does not seem like "radical" 
fits such a responsible decision.

 * Thanks to The Times for exposing the far right's school board takeover 
strategy ("Conservatives Take Best Shot at School Boards"). 
</P>
<P>
 Every parent and community member needs to understand the dangers associated 
with a small group with a specific, limited agenda frequently having very 
little to do with improving the quality of public education. The turmoil and 
strife we've seen in cities like Vista could become a reality here. 
</P>
<P>
 These candidates often praise the concept of "local control," only to receive 
money and ideological guidance from national groups far removed from local 
issues. Their real concern seems to be to weaken the public schools in 
preparation for yet another try at education by voucher, much like last year's 
rejected Prop. 174. 
</P>
<P>
 The best school board candidates usually have a vested interest in quality 
public schools. Their children attend, or attended those schools, they are 
involved in PTA, youth sports and other curricular and extracurricular 
activities and, most important, they believe in public education, which has 
long been the cornerstone of our democracy.

CAMPAIGN SCARE IN SCHOOL BOARD RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The next few days will be some nail-biting times for Orange County parents as 
voters in several school districts decide whether their board majorities will 
move to the far right, as did Vista Unified School District (in San Diego 
County) two years ago. If so, will they be led down the same path toward fiscal 
ruin? Vista's fiscal health has deteriorated significantly since the extreme 
right took over, the result of widely publicized decisions of questionable 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Valley Unified School District is one that will experience a fierce 
fight for control of the board. Two mid-term extreme right trustees are tired 
of being on "the short end of a 3-2 vote," as trustee Debbie Hughes puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow extreme right trustee Frank L. Ury glibly dismisses all fears that 
Saddleback could follow in the footsteps of Vista. Instead, Ury characterizes 
those who make the comparison between Saddleback and Vista as agents bent on a 
campaign of scare. But there is plenty about which to be scared, when he states 
that "basically, what this election will be is union versus parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Why is this man always trying to pit us, neighbor against neighbor? Parents 
and educators in this community have been working hand-in-hand for a long 
while, with a multitude of successes to show for it. Why does he hold our 
neighbors who are teachers in such low regard? 
</P>
<P>
 If the majority switches, Ury will surely be SVUSD board president by January. 
Then we can count on an adversarial relationship between the board and our 
district's educators as he wages war with their unions. Our children will 
surely suffer in the classroom.

PARTY LABELS VITAL IN TELLING VOTERS ABOUT CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "Party Labels Damaging" (Oct. 26) opinion piece by Norma Brandel Gibbs is 
an exercise in self-disillusionment and illustrates why there needs to be more, 
not less, politicizing of nonpartisan election races. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the traditional career path for politicians has been to start as the 
dog catcher then run for water commissioner or city council and on up through 
the ranks. It's called paying one's dues. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, these people are not apolitical until some magical office at the county 
or state level makes them become "born again" public servants who acquire a 
flash of insight about differing viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 If one is a racist or Socialist as U.S. Senator, then he or she probably was 
such as the dog catcher. And that's where they should have been stopped cold in 
their career. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, as long as nonpartisan offices are government offices the possibility 
exists for some special-interest party to extend the office's services to 
unreasonable lengths. Former Irvine Mayor Larry Agran's antics and efforts to 
make Irvine a nuclear-free zone come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, while currently there is not a dime's worth of difference between 
Democrats and Republicans in how they actually govern, third parties are a 
growing movement in this country and should be differentiated even at the 
lowly, nonpartisan school board elections. 
</P>
<P>
 STEPHEN J. MOORE 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * I could not disagree more with Norma Brandel Gibbs' recent argument in 
support of nonpartisan local elections. She submits that voters should be able 
to measure the worthiness of potential office holders based on their 
qualifications rather than on any political affiliations. That sounds noble but 
in practice few of us have the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach, for example, has no fewer than 23 names on the ballot for 
City Council. Does Gibbs truly expect voters to research the "record of 
accomplishments" of all 23? 
</P>
<P>
 A candidate's party identification speaks volumes about his/her approach 
toward government and its role in our lives. Denying voters this pertinent 
information succeeds only in blurring the distinctions between the many choices 
available on election day and is a disservice to those of us who make the 
effort to participate.

IT'S TREES, PLEASE, IN LAGUNA BEACH

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What has made Laguna unique down through the years are: first, the people who 
created this delightful place; and second, the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The founders laid the town out beautifully with Heisler Park and lovely 
vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '70s, people gave us our lively Main Beach "window to the sea" and 
Pines Park and a mandate for a small town with no large hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 But in last analyses, the great-granddaddy of gifts is our natural greenbelt 
as the ultimate barrier to Los Angeles, which is knocking at our door eager to 
gobble us up!

 So when you choose your favorite candidates, first and foremost be sure of his

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; THE DEBATE ON PROPOSITION 187; PASSAGE WILL HELP SOLVE 
WELFARE CRISIS; TAXPAYERS CANNOT AFFORD TO SUBSIDIZE BOTH A LEGAL AND ILLEGAL 
UNDERCLASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSEMARIE AVILA, Rosemarie Avila is a member of the Santa Ana Unified School 
District Board of Education and a trustee at Biola University in La Mirada. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is not just about limiting public social services to illegal 
immigrants. It is about much more. It is about how we deal with a very 
difficult and significant problem in our society. And it goes right to the 
heart of who we are as a people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Liberty Island, in New York Harbor, stands the Statue of Liberty. In one 
hand she holds a flaming torch, a symbol of enlightenment and reason; in the 
other she holds the law, and inscribed on her foundation are words of welcome. 
As the French who gave us the statue beautifully symbolized, we are a people of 
reason who debate, discuss and attempt to make reasonable laws. We are a people 
who live by the rule of law. And yes, we are a compassionate people willing to 
share the blessings of liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the American experiment, Europe and other nations accepted and knew 
nothing else but masses of people living in poverty, just as can be found in 
much of today's Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 But America changed that. The French historian Edouard de Laboulaye, who 
suggested the Statue of Liberty, also wrote about his amazement in coming to 
America and seeing a large middle class, where most could enjoy the privileges 
once reserved only for the rich. No longer could the world accept the 
poverty-laden masses as a necessary evil. For now liberty, true freedom, had 
put in place incentives and opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the experience of the United States until we mistakenly waged a "war 
on poverty," spending billions on entitlements: welfare programs such as Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children, food stamps and Medi-Cal. But rather than 
reducing poverty, this well-meaning but ill-conceived practice has created a 
growing underclass of welfare generations. 
</P>
<P>
 We have become a nation that pays people not to mow lawns, not to wash dishes, 
not to clean houses. Thus we have created a giant vacuum. Our economy cannot 
run without inexpensive labor. We needed others to fill these entry-level jobs. 
And yes, a new group of people have been standing in line, jumping fences and 
waiting on corners, eager to fill the need. They have performed a great service 
in keeping our economy going. And we should be grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem is we now have growing masses of welfare recipients living on 
the edge of poverty. Plus, we have added a growing group of immigrants, many of 
whom are illegal, who, despite their very hard work, are also living on very 
little. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, we now have to deal with a mushrooming permanent 
underclass. It is a new experience. Do we allow pushcarts? Do we allow homeless 
to sleep out in the parks? Do we give to those who beg on the street corners? 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are many uncomfortable, but many feel victimized, for with the rise 
of poverty, we have seen the rise of crime and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution is not to lash out at the illegal immigrants, who have filled the 
vacuum that has been created by our own doing. We must reform our entire 
welfare system, and the Save Our State initiative is the first step in that 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a very real fear that taxpayers can no longer afford to give 
benefits to both the legal and the illegal. Due to entitlements, our nation and 
state are close to insolvency. The once prospering middle class has seen its 
collective tax bite progressively go up to almost 50% of their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with our fears and discomfort is the nagging question of compassion. Who 
would deny a bright, shining little face an education? Who would deny an 
operation to someone desperately ill -- especially when they live next door? 
</P>
<P>
 I am a first-generation immigrant from Central America and understand the 
experience of our students who must learn a new language and culture. But what 
may seem harsh or cruel upfront is often compassionate in the long run. If you 
overload a lifeboat, everyone would drown and you wouldn't be able to help 
anyone. We must respect our laws, and we must protect our ability to save, to 
help, to share with, to give rest to the oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
 We must as a people band together. We cannot leave it to the border patrols 
alone. Requiring papers to show legal residence will not make school 
administrators INS agents any more than they are Centers for Disease Control 
agents when they require immunization papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is a well-reasoned, moral and viable step toward solving a 
very difficult situation. It can be supported with compassion.

PERSONAL AND ECONOMIC HEALTH AT STAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The question is not "Proposition 186: Should California Be a Guinea Pig?" 
(Times editorial, Oct. 9) but "Proposition 186: Should California Lead?" With 
the defeat of the national health plan, the United States and South Africa 
remain the only two industrialized nations in the world without national health 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The editorial, citing favorably "Canada's well-tested single payer insurance 
system," attributes its success to the fact that all of the state (provincial) 
governments participate in the Canadian plan. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not begin that way. The successful Canadian plan originated in the 
province of Saskatchewan and spread across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this not a good example for California? Nor was the fact noted that the 
states of Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Hawaii have initiated statewide health 
plans. Nor was an evaluation made of their provisions and performance. 
</P>
<P>
 If we regard health care as a social good rather than a commodity, as other 
Western countries do, we could devise a more rational system for delivering it. 
And Proposition 186 is a first step. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Orange County board of directors voted to 
join more than 500 other organizations in California that are supporting 
Proposition 186 because it will provide access to health care for all 
Californians, full mental health benefits, full long-term care benefits, 
prescription drug coverage, some dental benefits and free choice of any doctor.

 * November's election will bring before the voters of California one of the 
most expensive propositions ever to come before the people of our state. The 
issue is Proposition 186, the "Single-Payer Initiative," also known as the 
"California Health Security Act." 
</P>
<P>
 It is anything but "health security," and it would be expensive for every 
citizen in California. The proposition would require most Californians to give 
up their private health coverage and instead get health care coverage through a 
massive new state bureaucracy. It is estimated by the nonpartisan State 
Legislative Analyst that the proposal would increase taxes more than $40 
billion annually, nearly doubling the present state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 To finance this plan, a personal income tax surcharge of 2.5% to 5% would be 
levied on taxpayers (depending on income). Additionally, employers would be 
taxed a payroll tax from 4.4% to 8.9% of total payroll (depending on the number 
of employees -- roughly $50,400 for an employer with 30 employees and a monthly 
payroll of $60,000), undoubtedly driving more employers and more jobs from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectrum Economics, a private consulting firm, has estimated that the measure 
will cost almost 300,000 jobs by the time it is fully implemented. A 
$1-per-pack cigarette tax also would be imposed to help pay for the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 From the business perspective alone, the payroll tax on business and the 
subsequent loss of jobs and economic development would be a disastrous setback 
to efforts that have been made to strengthen the state's business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Vote "No" on Proposition 186, the "Single-Payer Initiative." Your job may be 
at stake this time.

REMEMBER RECALL SPIRIT IN FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The efforts of Fullerton's voters in last June's recall election are close to 
being realized. The majority of the candidates in the Nov. 8 election say they 
will repeal the utility tax, or at worst let it expire.A balanced budget with 
no new taxes must no doubt follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment is in the spotlight and will surely be restored to its only 
lawful purpose of aiding truly blighted areas within our city. Football 
stadiums, hilltop restaurants, railroad underpasses and hamburger stands are 
some of the things the recalled politicians spent redevelopment tax dollars on. 
Maybe now the taxes will be spent on real blight. Or maybe we don't need 
redevelopment and the low-cost housing it brings. 
</P>
<P>
 But close counts only in the game of horseshoes! Reelecting the recalled city 
council member and reelecting a council member, both who think redevelopment is 
wonderful, may get Fullerton taxpayers exactly what they voted against last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Vote for candidates who will keep their campaign promises to end the utility 
tax!

 The "LOVE" stamp must be the most popular one sold by the United States Post 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Love is also popular on bumper stickers such as "I New York," or "I Mario's 
Pizza." We use it to end letters and phone calls, with "I love you." I do that. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd never given any thought to the loose use of "love" until I read that the 
majority of California voters were in favor of Proposition 187, mistakenly 
called SOS for "Save Our State." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I've never been involved in these things I never really understand. 
</P>
<P>
 This is different. It is such a mean-spirited, selfish, racist, inhumane, 
non-loving proposal that I'm embarrassed to be asked to vote on it. 
</P>
<P>
 I think of Bonafacio. He can neither vote nor complain. He has a green card 
and is working to become a citizen. He can't vote, even if he had time. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonafacio and I share what might be called the same "apartment experience." He 
does the gardening. I pay my rent. He was hired when I moved in 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, he knew little English, and I knew little Spanish. We started a 
friendship with "Buenos dias" and "Buenos tardes." Now he has learned English, 
and we can actually communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 When our politicians are not talking about the "immigrant problem," they 
preach about values , especially family values. They might learn from 
Bonafacio. 
</P>
<P>
 We praise WORKING: Bonafacio's day starts in Santa Ana at 5 a.m., and he takes 
the bus to our apartment complex where he starts at 6:30. With good bus 
connections, he is back home at 5 in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekends? He has another job, nearly the same schedule, for Saturday and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 We praise FAMILY VALUES: Why does he work like I've never worked? To support 
his family, and to save money for a two-week trip to be with his extended 
family in Mexico at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to understand democracy, spend less time in the library with 
Plato, and more time in the buses with people" said Simeon Strunsky. 
</P>
<P>
 I take a main line OCTA bus that travels up Harbor Boulevard from Newport 
Beach to the Disneyland recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
 I share it with many for whom it is the only form of transportation -- hotel 
housekeepers, waitresses, busboys, mechanics, gardeners, mothers and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Without them, most businesses would not be able to operate. And, if courtesy 
(which is in short supply) is a value , they are mostly good examples of 
friendliness. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know whether they are illegal residents or green card holders. With 
the mandates of Proposition 187, it could lead some overzealous informer to 
turn them in because of their dark skin, accents or names ending with vowels. 
</P>
<P>
 We send troops to foreign lands to fight for human rights and democracy. Is it 
possible that in the process we have lost our sense of human decency and 
freedom here at home in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 Is the Statue of Liberty now a symbol of selfishness and hypocrisy? 
</P>
<P>
 SOS is more than an embarrassment for me. It is without compassion or human 
understanding. It is a bitter, shameful proposal that undermines our American 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Bonafacio merely shrugs his shoulders and smiles. He is used to 
this type of harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 We now say "Good morning" instead of "Buenos dias, " and I always get a laugh 
with "Mucho trabajo, poco dinero."  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, I still have some "LOVE" stamps that I may never use again.

MISSION PLAYS HOST TO A DAY OF UNDERSTANDING; RELIGION: ABOUT 600 ATTEND THE 
RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY FAIRE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE WORLD'S WIDE SPECTRUM OF 
BELIEFS.

 The Arabic chant calling Muslim followers to prayer on Saturday afternoon 
filled the courtyard of Mission San Juan Capistrano, founded more than two 
centuries ago to spread the Christian faith to California's Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours earlier in the gym of the mission school, a rabbi and cantor in 
shawls presented a Sabbath service, reading from the Torah before a crowd that 
included Roman Catholic priests and the president of the Hare Krishna temple in 
Laguna Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was Orange County's first Religious Diversity Faire, which 
attracted about 600 people interested in learning about the world's wide 
spectrum of religions. The daylong event was sponsored by the National 
Conference (formerly called the National Conference of Christians and Jews) and 
the Alliance for Spiritual Community. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the event, which included workshops as well as services, came 
from Rabbi Allen Krause of Temple Beth El in Aliso Viejo and chairman of the 
interfaith clergy committee of the National Conference in Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 Krause said his goal is to increase religious understanding and tolerance. 
"Everyplace needs it, but Orange County particularly because of its history of 
being a place where there have been intolerant acts and beliefs," he said. "For 
example, Orange County is the home base of the skinheads in the U.S."  
</P>
<P>
 Cooperation among religious faiths, he said, also can help the county's 
residents deal with such issues as street gangs and crime. "The more we are 
able to learn to get along with each other," he said, "the more effort we will 
put into solving problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the fair's participants, such as Beth Malone, a second-grade teacher 
at San Juan Elementary School, said they appreciated the rare opportunity to 
learn about faiths that are predominant in other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm curious and can't afford to travel to the countries that were the 
birthplaces of these faiths," Malone said, adding that she hoped to share what 
she learns with her students. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the turnout was far larger than originally anticipated and 
that the greatest attendance was in workshops that discussed Eastern religions 
such as Hinduism, Islam and Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
 Shabbir Mansuri, founding director of the Council on Islamic Education, talked 
about common misconceptions that many Americans have about Muslims and their 
Islamic faith. For instance, he said, Muslims usually are portrayed as Arabs, 
although he said only about 18% of the world's Muslims are of Arab background. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansuri said he decided to dedicate his efforts to changing the way Muslims 
are written about and pictured in American school textbooks after he discovered 
his daughter laughing over a textbook passage that said Muslims pray while 
rubbing their faces in the sand. "We don't have sand in our home," Mansuri 
said, drawing laughs from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 After approaching textbook publishers, Mansuri said, he was able to negotiate 
some corrections. "My research indicates there is no deliberate attempt (by 
publishers) to malign a religion," he said. Rather, he said, the mistakes in 
school textbooks stem from ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to questions, Mansuri said that the civil rights violations in the 
Middle East perpetrated by national leaders stem from the area's political 
culture, not from the Islam religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people oppressing their own people are Muslims. But it goes against the 
grain of Islam," he said. "The Muslim masses are craving for what American 
democracy is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, religious leaders and participants stressed the 
similarities, rather than differences, of their beliefs.  
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Paul Martin, pastor of Mission San Juan Capistrano, said the late Pope 
John XXIII had urged Catholics to "emphasize the things we agree on first. That 
is the basis of dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 Swami Viprananda of the Vedanta Society, which has a monastery in Trabuco 
Canyon said, "One of our basic beliefs is all religions lead to God." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants said it was more than the sunny day that brought them to the 
mission grounds. "There is some kind of hunger, reaching, that is very broadly 
felt," said Frank E. Hotchkiss, an Episcopalian from Laguna Niguel, one of the 
few who knew the words to the songs at the Jewish service. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotchkiss, who with his wife, Kay, helped to found an Episcopalian church in 
their community, said he got interested in Hebrew music when he attended an 
interfaith service one Thanksgiving and now joins the choir at Krause's temple 
on High Holy Days.

DEMOCRATS WANT POLLS MONITORED; ELECTIONS: LOCAL PARTY LEADERS SEEK FEDERAL 
OBSERVERS IN LATINO PRECINCTS. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RULES THAT OUT AND DECLINES 
COMMENT ON OTHER OPTIONS. GOP SAYS IT HAS NO PLANS TO CHALLENGE VOTERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County Democratic Party leaders said Saturday that they have formally 
asked the U.S. Department of Justice to monitor local polls on Election Day, 
fearing that voter intimidation tactics might be used in heavily Latino 
precincts in central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter requesting the monitors was sent to the Justice Department on Friday, 
the same day the agency announced that federal observers would not be sent to 
Orange County on Tuesday because the county does not meet the eligibility 
requirements set out in the Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Justice Department spokesman would not comment on whether the agency was 
still considering other options, such as dispatching a civil rights attorney or 
federal marshals to monitor the voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is believed to be the only area in Southern California where 
monitors have been formally requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Justice Department's refusal to respond publicly, the letter from 
the Orange County Democratic Party and its fund-raising arm, the Democratic 
Foundation, noted, "We are heartened to know that your staff will take every 
possible step to monitor the election process closely . . . and we hope that 
you will be prepared to take immediate action to ensure that no voter is 
deprived of his or her rights by Republican goons." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Christiansen, executive director of the Orange County Republican Party, 
said Saturday that the party has no plans to post guards or attempt to 
intimidate voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would love it if everybody went out to vote," Christiansen said, adding 
that the Democrats' release of the letter Saturday might be a publicity ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic Party's request follows a similar appeal made last September by 
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, after state 
Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) proposed posting volunteer poll watchers 
in Santa Ana. Conroy said he believes Democrats have registered non-citizens to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's spokesman, Jim Bieber, said last week that volunteers will not 
approach voters or challenge their qualifications Tuesday but will investigate 
the voter rolls after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthering Democrats' fears of potential voter intimidation is a plan by one 
of the leaders of the pro-Proposition 187 campaign to post signs reading "Only 
citizens can vote!" at polling places. The initiative, which proponents call 
"Save Our State," would deny social services, education and all but emergency 
health care to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Save Our State committee member Barbara A. Coe of Huntington Beach distributed 
the flyers throughout the state, with instructions to volunteers that they be 
posted 100 feet from polling places, in accordance with state electioneering 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Coe said she "absolutely" favors federal monitoring of Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing that is our primary concern is that illegal aliens are going to 
stuff the ballot box," Coe said. "I would find it fantastic that (voters) were 
being monitored; as long as (the Justice Department is) monitoring fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney said Friday that he does not 
think federal monitors are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope everyone keeps a cool head (on Election Day)," Tanney said. "I 
don't think it's necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 The plans of Conroy and Coe have reopened old wounds from the 1988 election, 
when Republicans posted uniformed security guards in heavily Latino precincts 
in Santa Ana. The guards held signs in English and Spanish warning non-citizens 
that they could not vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats claimed Latino voters were intimidated by the guards. Republicans 
subsequently paid $400,000 to settle a lawsuit over the issue.

TEARS FOR LA HABRA OFFICER; FUNERAL: ABOUT 1,000 COLLEAGUES ARE AMONG 2,000 
MOURNERS AT SERVICES FOR MICHAEL OSORNIO, WHO WAS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY BY 
A SUSPECTED DRUNK DRIVER. 
</P>

<P>
 More than 1,000 Southland law enforcement officers paid their respects 
Saturday to La Habra Police Officer Michael Anthony Osornio, who was killed on 
duty Monday by a suspected drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 mourners crowded into Calvary Chapel in Diamond Bar as colleagues 
and friends remembered Osornio as an eager young officer who on most nights 
could barely wait to get out of the squad room and onto patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had star quality," La Habra Police Chief Steven Staveley said. "Mike lived 
every day as a police officer with honor. His life was short, his heart was 
true. His contributions to the community were great and he will be with us 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old officer was the first La Habra officer killed in the line of 
duty. Osornio became engaged to his high school sweetheart just two weeks 
before he was killed and was remembered as being part of a close-knit family 
that supported his dream of becoming a cop. 
</P>
<P>
 "His family always came first," Staveley said. "In his job application, he 
wrote about how much his family meant to him and how much he valued them. That 
solid background prepared him well for the rigors of police work." 
</P>
<P>
 Osornio, the youngest of four children, visited his parents, Rafael and 
Guadalupe Osornio, almost daily. He lived in Montclair with his fiancee and had 
just purchased a home that he was in the process of renovating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was to be his dream house," Sgt. Vernon Mangels said during his eulogy. 
"Now, it stands unfinished." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had been a police officer for only 14 months, Osornio was a 
popular member of the 86-member force and known for an outgoing personality and 
sense of humor, colleagues said at the service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike was a great cop with a bright future," Mangels said. "He cared about 
people and he loved his career. I can't think of a day that went by that Mike 
didn't have something good to say about somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Mangels recalled how Osornio decided to celebrate when he passed his probation 
period with the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traditional probation-passing activity is to go to a restaurant," Mangels 
said. "But Mike brought a barbecue to work and at 2 a.m., he barbecued 
hamburgers for the crew." 
</P>
<P>
 Mangels said Osornio's best quality as a police officer was that he "was 
sensitive to people's feelings and he cared about what happened to them. Thank 
God for the time we had with Mike on Earth and thank God for the hearts he 
touched." 
</P>
<P>
 As a rendition of "Amazing Grace" was played on a bagpipe, pallbearers slowly 
carried the officer's mahogany casket, draped with two American flags, out of 
the church and placed it into a white hearse. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearse then followed 50 motorcycle officers in a funeral procession of 
hundreds of police cars to Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike would have loved all of this," his close friend, 26-year-old Anthony 
Campillo, remarked after the service. "He would have loved that they closed the 
freeway for his funeral." 
</P>
<P>
 During the graveside service that followed, five police helicopters flew 
overhead in a missing-man formation. Then there was a 21-gun salute by the Los 
Angeles Police Department Honor Guard. Row after row of police officers, 
including the entire La Habra force, stood at attention as "Taps" was played. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer's 52-year-old mother trembled and tightly hugged the folded 
American flag that was presented to her by Chief Staveley. The other flag was 
given to Osornio's fiancee, Chartina Skipper, 25, who silently wept. Rafael 
Osornio, 54, sat stoically as he was presented with a letter from Gov. Pete 
Wilson with words of praise for his son. The chief read the governor's letter 
at the service. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer is also survived by sisters Sonia Osornio and Margarita O. 
Nungaray and brother Rafael Osornio. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members and friends gently placed single red roses on top of the 
coffin, then consoled one another underneath a canopy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My cousin was wonderful and always there for you," Veronica Garcia said as 
the crowd began to disperse. "He was the best." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the district attorney's office charged the suspected drunk driver, 
Marco Villegas Ramirez, with gross vehicular manslaughter instead of murder as 
had been requested by the officer's department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Ramirez, 51, Monday night after his car allegedly raced 
through a red light at approximately 60 m.p.h. and slammed into Osornio's 
cruiser at Beach and La Habra boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so disgusted with the man who did this to Mike," Garcia said. "I still 
can't believe this has happened."  
</P>
<P>
 Outside the memorial service. Staveley called the young officer's death "a 
terrible waste." 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's idiotic," the chief said. "This is a police officer who was taking 
care of our community. And when something like this happens, it just tears at 
the fabric of society."

CATCHING CHILDREN, LEST THEY FALL; SERVICES: SAN CLEMENTE YOUTH AT RISK PROGRAM 
REACHES OUT TO 80 MOSTLY DISADVANTAGED YOUNGSTERS WITH SOCIAL SUPPORT IN TWO 
NEIGHBORHOODS.

<P>
 Even among the poor children who participate every day in the city's Youth At 
Risk program, 8-year-old Martin stood out. 
</P>
<P>
 To recreation leaders, the feisty, brown-eyed boy seemed more like a little 
man in child's clothing, except that Martin seldom wore a shirt or shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 They discovered that Martin's mother was in jail for drug possession. Left 
with his mother's roommate, the boy wasn't going to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed to be a little adult," said recreation supervisor Jaimie Ochs. "He 
has a little 3-year-old brother, and he watched over him when they came out 
here to play. I had a feeling there were problems in his life, but when he 
showed up without shoes on a rainy day, I knew I had to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 It took one phone call to county social services to turn Martin's life around. 
Social workers found his uncle, and for now, Martin is being cared for by 
relatives and is back in school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Youth At Risk was founded in the turmoil and painful introspection San 
Clemente residents experienced after 17-year-old Steve Woods died at the hands 
of other young people last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Speared through the head by a paint-roller rod thrown from a group of Latino 
youths at Calafia State Beach, the teen-ager's death polarized this racially 
diverse city. Woods' relatives and residents blamed the killing on San Clemente 
gang members -- and some Latinos saw that reaction as racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Clemente's community image was really tarnished by the Steve Woods 
killing," Mayor Scott Diehl. "But his death crystallized the city. We decided 
we really needed to reach out to kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Some new youth programs were already being organized, but the tragic death 
hurried their formation. Created were the city's Task Force for Youth and the 
high school's Peer Assistance Leadership program. Both groups reach out toward 
young people by sponsoring multicultural events, and establishing mentorship 
and tutoring programs along with other services. 
</P>
<P>
 The city set aside $40,000 in July to start Youth At Risk -- a program that 
does far more than throw out a few balls and set up table games for about 80 
youths who participate. 
</P>
<P>
 There are pickup games of grass hockey, checkers and all the standard 
recreational fare run by city staff members who aren't that long out of school 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But Youth At Risk goes further. It works primarily with the poor, 
predominantly Latino population of San Clemente, especially preschoolers 
through young teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every week, sheriff's deputies visit two sites served by the program to 
discuss drug abuse, then stick around to play with the kids. Youngsters such as 
Martin, who never had been away from home by themselves, go on overnight beach 
camping trips. Family counselors offer free advice to parents and children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Max Berg (Park) the other day and saw our counselor sitting in a 
car with a child's parents," said program director Julie Lamphear. "We're 
showing them that somebody does care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slowly, I think we're creating unity in the community," she said. "I think 
this program could be the start of something big." 
</P>
<P>
 Something big for 15-year-old Christina (not her real name) is a $4-per-hour, 
after-school job that she landed with the help of Kids At Risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started her off by helping out with the program," Lamphear said. "But she 
had an attitude. For one thing, she couldn't understand why she couldn't bring 
cigarettes to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled her into the office and told her that she needed to be a role model, 
and from then on, I began seeing positive changes in her," Lamphear said. "We 
gave her a reference that helped her get a part-time job and I hear she's doing 
well. That's what I consider a success story." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente real estate agent Jim Miranda, a longtime organizer of Latino 
programs in the city, said Youth At Risk helps young people "who might become 
wanna-be gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Programs like this give them things to do and keep them involved in quality 
activities," he said. "This program winds up helping the whole community."  
</P>
<P>
 Although aimed at underprivileged youths, city officials say the program helps 
other children. To spread the benefits, the city operates Kids At Risk in two 
neighborhoods: The affluent hillside homes served by Truman Benedict Elementary 
School and the overcrowded, modest apartments near Max Berg Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and up to 40 other children participate in the program at Max Berg 
Park, a large, circular patch of green that residents say used to be the turf 
of a local gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Max Berg Park has long been the focal point of the Hispanic community," said 
Miranda, who organized a soccer league at the park two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the city increased police patrols and instituted a 
neighborhood cleanup program. With the added presence of Youth At Risk 
counselors, "It's nice now," said Elvira Orta, whose two preschoolers 
participate in the program. "It feels safe here." 
</P>
<P>
 For 5-year-old Jaime Alvarez, who has never heard of Steve Woods and doesn't 
know a social program from a polo match, Youth At Risk "is fun. I like playing 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Orta credits the recreation staff and counselors with providing a safe, 
enjoyable atmosphere for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "They teach them how to be polite and how to play nice with other kids," she 
said. "They talk to them like real people."

COUNCIL EXPLORES OPTIONS TO GARAGE SALE CLUTTER; ENTERPRISE: ANAHEIM OFFICIALS 
SAY SOME RESIDENTS ARE OPERATING ILLEGAL SMALL BUSINESSES. SOLUTIONS INCLUDE 
RESTRICTING DATES FOR RESIDENTIAL VENDORS OR REQUIRING LOW-COST PERMITS. 
</P>

<P>
 City officials say they want to find a way to curb hundreds of unsightly yard 
sales in neighborhood driveways every weekend, often operating as small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our community is being blighted by the proliferation of garage sales and yard 
sales," said Councilman Frank Feldhaus. "There is junk on yards and on the 
sidewalks. People lay clothes on yards and trees and just don't display any of 
it well. I want to see a city that I'm damned proud to live in and that will 
bring tourists in." 
</P>
<P>
 The sales have become common throughout the city, with more than 200 occurring 
on an average weekend, city officials said. While usually a way to get rid of 
old clothes, furniture or appliances to earn a few dollars, the sales are 
becoming increasingly commercial, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that the same people are having them weekend to weekend to weekend, 
and it's become something of a business," Councilman Irv Pickler said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Poole, city code enforcement manager, said he often sees a large number 
of used appliances being sold in a single location and an increasing amount of 
brand-new merchandise on sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more than just stuff people pulled out of their garage," Poole said. 
"For some people, this is turning into a commercial business." 
</P>
<P>
 Poole said the city might be losing some possible revenue from business 
license fees and sales tax incomes if commercial merchandise is being sold 
illegally, but he said this has not been a concern of city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's main concern is preserving residential areas," Poole said. "We 
wouldn't want any revenue from that type of sale because it deteriorates the 
neighborhood. The practice itself is what's the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The sales are already prohibited under Anaheim's zoning code, but the code is 
rarely enforced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technically, they are not allowed," Poole said. "But as long as no one is 
routinely having them, we haven't taken any action. We try to work with people, 
because a lot of residents have an occasional sale. Where we have gotten 
involved is where it's a continual thing or a commercial enterprise. (That is) 
the reason we have residential zones, so you don't have the intrusion of 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly said he would at least like to see some stepped-up enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There does seem to be an extra amount of abuse on the weekends," Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to formally discuss ways to deal with the 
situation later this month. Among the possible solutions: designating only 
certain days during the year for the sales; allowing only a certain number of 
sales per address; or requiring that residents obtain a low-cost permit, 
Feldhaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city were to restrict the sales to a limited number of occasions during 
the year, officials would be following in the footsteps of the Santa Ana City 
Council, which passed an ordinance earlier this year in an effort to curb 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, the sales are allowed only on the first weekend of four months 
out of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Santa Ana's ordinance is too restrictive," Feldhaus said. "But 
maybe we can start off with six times per year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Anaheim resident Amin David, a Latino activist, said he doesn't see the 
need for any restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drive around Anaheim and I don't see that this is something that should 
cause alarm," he said. "These sales have mostly Latino buyers because of the 
low-income strata we occupy. They are out there looking for things that are 
needed at a very low cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was opposed to the Santa Ana ordinance," David added. "I think it stopped a 
lot of people from having an income."

LAKE FOREST MAN JAILED IN KROQ RUSE; ARREST: MAN POSING AS A RADIO PERSONALITY 
OFFERED CONCERT TICKETS FOR SEXUAL FAVORS, INVESTIGATORS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Lake Forest man posing as a radio personality of a Los Angeles station has 
been jailed on suspicion of offering teen-age girls concert tickets in exchange 
for sexual favors, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Department investigators said David Eugene Zebe, 27, 
approached more than 30 girls, ages 14 to 17, with the ticket offer and kissed 
or fondled at least three of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He drives up to these girls and says, 'Hey, what would you do to win 
tickets?' " said Mark Simon, an investigator with the sheriff's sex crimes 
unit. "He tells them he works for KROQ and he shows them a fake ID card. Some 
of the girls trusted him and actually believed he was from KROQ." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrested Zebe on Thursday afternoon after a 15-year-old Aliso Viejo 
High School student told officers that she was scheduled to meet Zebe that day. 
The girl had been warned by a friend from Rancho Santiago High School who had 
heard about a suspicious-appearing man going around her school offering girls 
concert tickets, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had two tickets for Friday night's Green Day concert on him when we 
arrested him," Simon said. "The first thing he said was, 'I need counseling.' 
At that point, we knew he'd probably be talkative." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon said that five or six girls have come forward, and that investigators 
are looking for other possible victims. Employees at the radio station said 
having rambunctious fans pose as their employees has happened before. But after 
receiving telephone calls from suspicious teens and their parents, the radio 
station's management decided to file a complaint with police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm super glad they caught him," said John Frost, creative director and disc 
jockey at KROQ-FM. "I'm glad because it's kind of scary. We have very loyal 
listeners in many ways. In some ways that's good and in some ways, people get 
obsessed." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon said that Zebe told officers he had been posing as an employee from the 
station for the past month and also admitted making obscene phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Zebe was being held Saturday at Orange County Jail in lieu of $25,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled to be arraigned Monday in Laguna Niguel Municipal Court on 
charges of attempted child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department requested that anyone with information contact 
investigators at (714) 647-7449, or at (714) 647-1832 after regular business 
hours.

TOLLWAY FOES LEARN HOW TO DRIVE HOME A POINT; PROTEST: THEY WANT TO BE READY IF 
COURTS ALLOW BULLDOZERS TO RESUME WORK ON NEW ROAD THROUGH LAGUNA CANYON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The men and women who gathered Saturday in a Laguna Beach church for civil 
disobedience training didn't look much like a pack of scofflaws. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of 18 -- including City Council candidate Beth Leeds and about half 
a dozen senior citizens -- munched bagels and talked city politics. Then they 
arranged their chairs in a circle and got down to business. 
</P>
<P>
 They were there for one reason: to consider whether they are willing to be 
arrested to try to block construction of a toll road in Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the group were seasoned protesters, others were considering risking 
arrest for the first time. Most were from Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our belief in standing before the bulldozers we will spark a moral 
outcry that will bring other people forward to join us," said Tim Carpenter, 
the group's leader, a Santa Ana resident who is founder of the activist group 
Alliance for Survival. "Our goal is to slow down the bulldozers as much as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter offered practical tips should the bulldozers return: He urged 
participants to appoint a "support person" to drive them to the protest site 
and to connect with an "affinity group" once they get there. Bring a photo 
identification, he said, don't wear jewelry, smile at police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Canyon Coalition Civil Disobedience Training Session" was called in 
anticipation of a court ruling expected later this year regarding construction 
of the San Joaquin Hills tollway through Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has stirred passions in Laguna Beach, a city that has worked for 
years to keep development out of the bucolic canyon that is one of only two 
pathways into town. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-mile San Joaquin Hills tollway would cut through Laguna Canyon and the 
Laguna Coast Wilderness Park as it links San Juan Capistrano to Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is well underway at both ends of the project, but a legal 
challenge by environmental groups, led by Laguna Greenbelt Inc., has stalled 
work in the canyon. The court challenge centers on whether the Federal Highway 
Administration conducted a proper environmental review before approving the 
toll road in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, a drama unfolded in the canyon north of El Toro Road when a judge 
ruled grading could begin, prompting bulldozers and protesters to race to the 
site. One protester chained himself to a bulldozer and another was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The grading was halted the following day by a second court order. In 
September, a three-judge panel from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard 
arguments on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Transportation Corridor Agencies, which is charged with 
building the road, said Friday that they are hoping for a ruling sometime this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking forward to a ruling and we're hoping it comes quickly," Lisa 
Telles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Telles said she expects the ruling will favor the tollway agency and 
protesters will return to the site. If they interfere with construction, she 
said, they will be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it has to do with safety as well," Telles said. "That is our No. 1 
concern, safety on the site." 
</P>
<P>
 Between now and the court's final decision, protesters will be on "tactical 
alert," said Carpenter, who is planning another session to train others who 
planned to attend Saturday's meeting but were sidetracked by election duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier last week, Alliance executive director Marion Pack said protesters 
should keep "a nonviolent perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence begets violence, and we would like to see a peaceful resolution of 
the issue of Laguna Canyon," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The training sessions create a sense of unity among toll road opponents, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't tell people: 'You're going to chain yourself to a bulldozer, you're 
going to go limp,' " Pack said. "These are personal decisions."

MAN CONVICTED IN SHOOTOUT IN 1992 TO SERVE TIME AT CYA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old man, convicted for his role in a 1992 shootout in Huntington 
Beach that left three people wounded, has been sentenced to more than 15 years 
in the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aerick William Bacon will be eligible for release by the time he is 23 and 
must be released from CYA by age 25, according to the Orange County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacon was convicted in May of attempted murder of an Orange County sheriff's 
deputy, assault with a deadly weapon and attempted robbery. Bacon was a minor 
at the time of the crime but was ordered to stand trial as an adult and was 
eligible to be sentenced to state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the shootout took place Nov. 7, 1992, when a deputy 
approached four youths sitting in a car, planning a robbery in the Bolsa Chica 
Ecological Reserve parking lot. Bacon and another youth opened fire on the 
deputy, who retreated behind his car door but was hit in the face by glass and 
metal fragments.  
</P>
<P>
 As the suspects fled down the Pacific Coast Highway toward Huntington Beach 
and fired indiscriminately at bystanders, another man's car was hit and glass 
fragments became embedded in his head. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, Bacon and another assailant took refuge in a condominium 
complex. A man who resisted handing over his car keys to the fugitives was 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Mones, 17, of Huntington Beach, committed suicide at the complex rather 
than face arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Gonzalez, 20, of Garden Grove was convicted of conspiracy to commit 
robbery, attempted murder and assault. The fourth man, Travis Claude, 20, of 
Long Beach, pleaded guilty and testified against his accomplices.

EL TORO AIRPORT INITIATIVE REQUIRES EDUCATED DECISION ON VOTERS' PART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm tired of backers of Measure A claiming the opponents don't trust the 
democratic process of allowing the voters to decide, yet out of the other 
corner of their mouths they accuse the county supervisors and the El Toro Reuse 
Planning Authority of being biased and undemocratic. Truly amazing! 
</P>
<P>
 It is, however, more alarming to me that one of the biggest decisions for 
Orange County's future is being overshadowed by major state propositions. This 
must be making the supporters very happy as the most researched information has 
come from the newspapers and has only reached those who have taken the time to 
read about the issue. Unfortunately, this rush-rush measure has not allowed 
time for adequate studies to be done regarding costs and benefits, and we are 
being told to believe the measure backers. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to trust the democratic process, even if it can be abused by those with 
money seeking power and profit at others' expense. I believe that when the 
voters get to the polls and the 29 words on the ballot are all they know about 
the El Toro issue, their instincts will tell them don't sign until you see it 
in writing. Always sound advice. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * In order for Orange County to remain competitive, Measure A (the commercial 
airport initiative) should be approved by the voters next Tuesday. I cannot 
understand the reasoning of those who say that only large developers, like 
George Argyros, will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, businesses and craftsmen will benefit by providing materials and 
labor toward the construction of the airport. It will continue to provide 
employment for those who will work there. Orange County needs this airport in 
order to improve its economy as well as our employment rate. Measure A should 
be passed. 
</P>
<P>
 PAT ELLIOTT

<P>
 * We are told businesses will be moving in and around El Toro with an airport 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses are moving out of Southern California to Mexico, Taiwan, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Airports do not dictate business conduct. Good business climate and low costs 
do. Santa Clara and the Silicon Valley with no major airport are the perfect 
example! 
</P>
<P>
 NICHOLAS G. DZEPINA 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 * I've been wary about Measure A, the airport initiative, since I first heard 
about it. I knew that it sounded pretty stupid to put a full-scale airport in 
the middle of one of the most populated areas in Orange County, only a few 
miles from an existing airport. I believe that (recent) events are painting the 
true picture of who is really behind the initiative. I'm referring to the 
donation of $634,000 (including a $193,950 contribution in kind) to the 
pro-airport group by George Argyros, a Newport Beach developer, which 
demonstrates that it's primarily a few wealthy businessmen who really want the 
airport to be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you bought into the number of new jobs they claim will be created, the 
number is far less than that which would be produced by expanding the base for 
similar uses as those that now exist in the nearby Spectrum commercial and 
industrial park. In fact, there have been hundreds of suggestions for potential 
uses for the base which create jobs and other major benefits for Orange County, 
but the airport proponents don't want to give them a chance. I hope the voters 
of Orange County see who's really behind Measure A and vote it down.

<P>
 * Regarding the Times Orange County Poll on El Toro ("Electorate Still Can't 
Decide on El Toro Airport," Oct. 30): To believe that millionaire developer 
George Argyros (co-signer on the Measure A initiative) is being magnanimous by 
pouring another $440,000 of his personal funds just to (bring) jobs to Orange 
County, you would have to also believe in Peter Pan and the Tooth Fairy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake up, electorate. There is only one reason for someone to spend that kind 
of money and it has nothing to do with providing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 MERYL SCHWARTZ 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * I am voting for Measure A, the El Toro airport issue, because I am very much 
concerned about losing military protection with the base closure. Do we really 
think the world is safe enough to reduce our military? I do not! If we vote for 
a commercial airport, the runways will remain, and in case of a military 
emergency the airport would be available to us.

POLICE INVESTIGATING LAGUNA BEACH BEATING AS A HATE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two assailants attacked a man in broad daylight Saturday, hurling anti-gay 
epithets and beating him, apparently in a dispute over money that police are 
investigating as a hate crime, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Nichols, 18, of Laguna Beach and a 16-year-old suspect were arrested 
later in the day on suspicion of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, 
Detective Jason Kravetz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, identified only as a Laguna Beach man in his 30s, was approached 
from behind about 1:30 p.m. while he walking south on the sidewalk in the 700 
block of Coast Highway, Kravetz said. Nichols pulled the man to the ground, 
then was joined in the assault by the 16-year-old who kicked the victim in the 
head, Kravetz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravetz said the victim and witnesses reported that the assailants yelled 
anti-gay epithets during the beating, which went on for several minutes. He 
said the suspects and victim knew each other and apparently were engaged in a 
dispute over money. The assailants robbed the victim, but Kravetz would not say 
how much money was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who witnessed the attack then came out of a nearby business and 
threatened to call the police, Kravetz said. The suspects fled in a Honda that 
was parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who witnessed the attack told police she recognized Nichols as someone 
with whom she had attended Laguna Beach High School, Kravetz said. Nichols was 
arrested at his home about two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old, a Laguna Beach High School student, was arrested about 7:30 
Saturday night as he was driving on Coast Highway near the site of the attack, 
Kravetz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravetz said police will recommend to the district attorney's office that the 
assault be prosecuted as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim suffered cuts and bruises but declined medical attention, the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was the second recent one in Laguna Beach that police investigated 
as a hate crime. In September, two tourists from Salt Lake City were attacked 
and robbed while walking on a stretch of beach. Police said the assailants 
uttered an anti-gay slur during the attack and shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Those attackers were never found, but police said the two attacks do not 
appear to be related.

PARKING PERMITS OKD FOR SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO CONDO COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a strict parking permit program for public 
streets in an 810-unit condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which will go into effect in February, will make permits 
mandatory for vehicles parked on streets of the Capistrano Villas condominiums 
between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the complex with a one-car garage will be allowed two permits; 
those with a two-car garage will be allowed one permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents may also apply for guest permits and appeal to a special board for 
additional permits. Cars without permits will be issued citations by the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The city program, approved Tuesday, replaces an earlier one that had been 
administered by the three homeowner associations of Capistrano Villas. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino residents had complained that the previous parking program was 
discriminatory because it required garage inspections and proof of residency at 
the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Latino residents expressed concern Tuesday about the new parking 
program. One resident said the city should spend more time trying to suppress 
gang activity at the condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is too much attention being paid to the parking program when there is 
no parking problem," Alberto Vasquez said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Another resident said the city had "very shoddily handled" the parking program 
and failed to listen to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But others disagreed. They said the parking program was badly needed because 
there were so many cars and limited space at the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 When the previous program was in effect in May, vandalism dropped at the 
Capistrano Villas, resident Gillian Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will review the parking program in the spring and report back 
to the council.

RESIDENT ALMOST HIT AS FLEEING DRIVER CRASHES INTO HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspected drunk driver allegedly trying to evade police crashed into a house 
early Saturday and narrowly missed a woman sleeping inside, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Haroutunian, 20, was arrested about 1 a.m. on suspicion of drunk 
driving, evading arrest and hit-and-run driving, said Police Lt. Mike Hanrahan. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect tried to flee and hid in the bushes after the collision, Hanrahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when police officers spotted the van heading the wrong way 
in the southbound lanes of Bushard Street near the Ellis Avenue intersection. 
Officers chased the driver, following the van into a housing tract, where it 
crashed into the home in the 17000 block of Walnut Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haroutunian was treated for injuries to his face but was not hospitalized, 
Hanrahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who was not identified, was not injured. Her home, however, 
sustained extensive damage, police said.

GARDEN GROVE APARTMENT FIRE DISPLACES 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sixteen people from three families had to be evacuated Friday from their 
apartment building after a fire broke out in a carport and caused extensive 
damage to three units, authorities and a Red Cross official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze broke out about 8:30 p.m. in a carport at 11062 Cynthia Circle at 
the Pepper Tree Apartments, Garden Grove fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Red Cross official said the agency put a family of six adults up in a motel 
over the weekend because their apartment had sustained heavy smoke damage.

 "It's not inhabitable at this point," said Scott Tokar, a volunteer public 
information officer for the Orange County chapter of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 The other 10 people displaced by the fire made their own arrangements for 
emergency shelter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities released no other information about the fire.

THE ISSUES ARE THERE -- BUT O.C. VOTERS MIGHT NOT BE; ELECTIONS: POLITICAL 
OBSERVERS AREN'T SURE WHETHER HOTLY DEBATED INITIATIVES WILL SPUR A LARGE 
TURNOUT AT THE POLLS.

<P>
 In an election year when voters say they are tired of politics as usual and 
negative campaigning, many candidates on Tuesday's ballot are giving the 
electorate more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the June primary, when voter apathy reached a 40-year high in 
Orange County, the ballot initiatives -- not necessarily the candidates 
themselves -- are giving voters reason to show up at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 From Proposition 187, the controversial statewide ballot measure that was born 
in Orange County and would restrict social services and education for illegal 
immigrants, to the proposed plan to place a commercial airport at El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station, local voters have plenty to decide on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to casting ballots for governor, U.S. senator and other statewide 
officers, local voters also will be deciding on: six congressional seats; nine 
state legislative posts; a county supervisor's race; 28 city council races; 13 
state and local judicial posts; more than 60 school board and special district 
races; and 11 city measures, including a proposed $500-million development on 
the 121-acre Headlands promontory near Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with so much to decide, some political observers find it hard to 
predict whether Orange County's 1.1 million voters will vent their anger by 
going to the polls, or follow the mood set in the June primary and stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all of the excitement, a majority of the people are going to stay home," 
UC Irvine political scientist Mark Petracca predicted, pointing to downward 
trends in voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be surprised, for instance, if many more people vote on 
Proposition 187 than the total votes cast for governor or senator. Because, 
yes, it's an issue that's attracting a lot of attention," Petracca said. "The 
question is: Is there any (candidate) left standing with any kind of dignity 
after it's all over? That's the tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney said he expects turnout to be 
about the same as it was in the last gubernatorial election in 1990, when 62% 
of the county's voters showed up at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to draw voter interest, candidates are making last-minute pitches on 
this final weekend before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican Party's statewide slate of candidates -- featuring Gov. Pete 
Wilson and U.S. Senate hopeful Michael Huffington -- will roll into Orange 
County today for a rally at the Orange County Fairgrounds starting at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown, meanwhile, is scheduled to 
make a pitch to Vietnamese Americans this afternoon during a KWIZ-FM radio 
program sponsored by the Westminster-based Vietnamese Community of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in Orange County where Republicans for statewide office count on a 
2-to-1 vote ratio -- generally about 200,000 votes more than for Democrats -- 
to offset Democratic strongholds in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a written goal (for turnout). I just want to make sure that our 
percentages are good," said John M. W. Moorlach, this year's precinct advisory 
committee chairman for the Orange County Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent Orange County meeting, Gov. Pete Wilson challenged local 
Republicans to stretch the vote margin to 250,000, Moorlach said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Democrats, this has not been an easy year. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who boosted their hopes two years ago by attracting Republican 
cross-over voters -- President Clinton -- is now in a popularity slump that is 
doing Orange County Democrats little good. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's only appearances in Orange County this election season were this 
weekend -- in Los Alamitos on Friday, briefly touting a defense industry 
contract with U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California 
shortly after Air Force One landed, and in Anaheim on Saturday where he 
addressed a convention of realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the GOP's usual dominance in local elections, Democrats hope to be 
competitive in four state legislative and congressional districts that overlap 
in the central part of the county, as well as in the 45th Congressional 
District, where Democrat Brett Williamson is challenging Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 The central Orange County seats where Democrats focused their voter 
registration drive are: the 46th Congressional District held by Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove), the redistricted 34th state Senate seat held by Sen. 
Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove), the 68th Assembly District represented by 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), and the 69th Assembly District held 
by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's decision to vacate the seat to run for state attorney general has 
been a perilous one for the Orange County Democratic Party, which risks losing 
its only local legislative seat, despite a 22-point voter registration margin 
over Republicans in the 69th district. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Q. Thompson, the campaign consultant for Jim Morrissey, the Republican 
who is running against Democrat Mike Metzler for Umberg's seat, downplayed the 
Democratic advantage in voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people were pushed and shoved and cajoled into registering to vote, and 
you are not going to see any response to it," Thompson said. "A lot of them are 
not going to vote and those that do, I am willing to bet, we get 50% of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Democratic Party Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia rejected the notion. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that was true, Tom Umberg would not have been reelected two years ago," 
Garcia said. In 1992, Umberg's vote margin surpassed the party's voter 
registration by six points. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garcia conceded that getting out the vote on Election Day is the 
Democrats' biggest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take the position that every candidate is a contest and we are going to do 
our best," Garcia said. "And that means working as hard as we can and walking 
precincts and doing phone banking." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to boost turnout, Metzler held a pancake breakfast on Saturday that was 
accompanied by an offer to transport voters to the registrar of voters office 
to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parties also are battling for control of the county's 2nd Supervisorial 
District seat being vacated by Harriett M. Wieder, even though the post is 
supposed to be nonpartisan. 
</P>
<P>
 In political terms, there is no love lost between the two candidates, Democrat 
Linda Moulton Patterson and Republican Jim Silva, who have been closely 
watching each other's campaigns in hopes of a decisive misstep in this runoff 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Moulton Patterson win, it would be the first time in Orange County's 
history that two women are seated on the five-member board. State Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) won the seat being vacated by Board Chairman Thomas 
F. Riley in the June Primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The political tension created by Proposition 187 has both parties concerned. 
Republicans have raised suspicions that Democrats have registered non-citizens 
to vote, and Democrats fear that Republicans might try to intimidate minority 
voters at polling places in heavily ethnic precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the anxiety, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange has called for 
"peace and harmony" after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever may be the outcome for Proposition 187 after Tuesday's elections, 
the state of California will need the grace of healing and harmony," church 
officials stated in a recent press release. "The Catholic Church in Orange 
County calls upon her people to pray for peace and reconciliation to cast aside 
the fear and bitterness that has overshadowed the state in the recent months."

 MINI-PLAYOFF: After a week off, the Los Angeles Rams return to action today 
against somebody they don't see very often: the Denver Broncos. The two teams, 
both in danger of falling completely out of playoff contention with 3-5 
records, have played only six times. Denver won their first meeting in 1972, in 
Los Angeles, and their last, in 1988, at Mile High Stadium. . . . Today is a 
rubber match of sorts; the series is tied at three victories apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 THE VOTING WALL: While most voters may be thinking about Proposition 187, or 
the gubernatorial or Senate races, in tiny Rossmoor, near Seal Beach, they've 
got to worry about their wall. The high wall surrounding the unincorporated 
community is suffering from serious earthquake damage. . . . Problem is, no one 
seems to know which government entity should be responsible for repairing it. 
Rossmoor voters will decide Tuesday whether to assign the task to their own 
community services district, plus whether to bump their taxes up $15 a year for 
wall repairs and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 CHALLENGING: Don't try to tell Chapman University professor Mark Maier that 
the Challenger space shuttle explosion eight years ago was an accident. Maier, 
whose expertise is leadership organization, is the producer of a video 
documentary on the disaster now used worldwide at 600 institutions. . . . "It 
could and should have been prevented," he says. "There were warning signs 
dating back years." Maier talks about it at a free event on campus Thursday 
night.

 BABY RUNNER: Alex Nackoul of Santa Ana has never run a marathon. The South 
County mortgage banker figures he'll start with the biggest of all -- so he's 
in Manhattan today for the 25th New York City Marathon. He's been training 
since March. . . . His reason: "My wife and I are awaiting our first child and 
it dawned on me that I'd better get in shape, so I can keep pace." Another 
reason: His wife Karen signed him up without telling him.

O.C. JUDGES, OFFICIALS RODE IN LAWYER'S LIMO; GOVERNMENT: WILLIAM W. STEWART, 
WHO HAS A CONTRACT TO DEFEND INDIGENTS, SAYS HE WAS NOT SEEKING INFLUENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local attorney selected by Orange County judges for a lucrative contract to 
defend indigents accused of crimes has for years provided local judges and 
other officials a chauffeur-driven limousine to ferry them to fund-raisers, 
private dinners and sporting events throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Some judges and the limousine driver said the passengers have included 
Superior Court Judges Myron S. Brown and Luis Cardenas, and Orange County 
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez -- some of the same officials who, at times, have 
helped oversee the county's contract with attorney William W. Stewart over the 
past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Also taking advantage of the limousine service was District Attorney 
Investigator Rusty Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
 All acknowledged being chauffeured around in the limousine, but denied there 
is anything wrong with what they did. 
</P>
<P>
 In some years, the Central Court contract, which was awarded to Stewart 
without competitive bidding, has been worth nearly $1 million in annual fees 
for his Santa Ana firm and its associates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word was out: If you wanted the limousine and you had a legitimate reason 
and if it was available, you could use it," said Cardenas, who recalled using 
the vehicle one time "a long time ago" to attend a local charity event with 
Stewart and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas later said he could have been a guest in the car on other occasions. 
He said he remembers being "impressed" that a law firm would have a limousine 
at its disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was particularly pleased to learn that Stewart's firm would often 
provide the car service as a "designated driver" for attorneys, judges or 
others who may have had too much too drink at functions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the drunk-driving thing, most of us tried to be careful," said 
Cardenas, adding that he never had to avail himself of Stewart's post-party 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said he maintained a "pretty open policy" with the car, and, on most 
occasions, accompanied those who used it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to buy judges," Stewart said. "There are judges who are 
friends of mine. I made the car available to a lot of charity events." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Fair Political Practices Commission requires judges and other 
elected California officials to report gifts valued at $50 or more -- including 
limousine services. The driver, who requested anonymity for fear of 
retribution, said the car charge was $25 per hour and -- except for quick 
one-way trips -- events typically ran two hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Cardenas nor Brown, a passenger in the car on at least three occasions 
in the past three years, reported any such gifts on their annual disclosure 
statements since 1987, the earliest year the judges' records were available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both judges have presided over cases in which Stewart's firm represented 
indigent clients under terms of the county contract. And Brown once chaired the 
Alternate Defense Committee, which wields considerable influence over indigent 
defense policy for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez, one of five members on the County Board of Supervisors, which has 
routinely granted contract extensions for Stewart's firm on the recommendation 
of local judges, said he was a guest in the car on two occasions. The 
supervisor said he paid the driver for one of the rides, a trip to Los Angeles 
to meet and dine with French government officials two or three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the driver, who took Vasquez to Los Angeles, said the supervisor "did not 
pay me 10 cents" because it was against the firm's policy for the driver to 
accept money from passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also about that time, the supervisor said he used the car on a second outing 
to host the wife of former U.S. Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh for a tour of the 
Orangewood Children's Home. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said he did not reimburse Stewart's firm for the limousine on that 
occasion, but he did not consider the Orangewood outing as a gift because he 
was "doing county business" by trying to secure more federal funding for 
Orangewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges, a key investigator in the prosecution of former Supervisor Don R. Roth 
on charges related to the improper acceptance of gifts, said he paid both times 
he used the car, once "chipping in about $20 or $30" for a trip to the airport 
three or four years ago, and again about two years ago to shuttle friends to a 
party for an office colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver said he recalled Hodges as a passenger in the car more than twice. 
However, he also said that the investigator once pushed $100 in his shirt 
pocket after an office party to cover the group's expenses for the four-hour 
outing, even though the driver was not supposed to accept payments from 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known all those guys a hundred years," Hodges said. "My deal was I paid 
the driver." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Judge Cardenas said he did not consider use of the limousine to be 
a gift because he recalled using it for only a charity event. "It wasn't like I 
was getting anything out of it," he said. "At the time, everything was very 
ethical to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he was typically one of several people in the car who accompanied 
Stewart to football games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during the past 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he never considered the limousine rides as something he would 
have to disclose in annual financial statements because of his long friendship 
with Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't dawn on me it was a gift . . . I don't believe it was. He and I 
have been friends for years," Brown said. Although he and Stewart have enjoyed 
a close relationship, Brown said he has been "careful to avoid the appearance 
of impropriety," especially when Stewart or his firm had cases in his court. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brown served as the presiding judge of criminal matters in Superior 
Court between 1987 and 1989, Stewart or his associates worked frequently in 
Brown's court on matters related to the indigent defense contract. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, Brown said, he tried to distance himself somewhat from his 
old friend Stewart, until associates suggested there was no reason to avoid 
socializing with him because of his judicial position. 
</P>
<P>
 About the end of his term as criminal presiding judge, Brown said he 
accompanied Stewart to Las Vegas and stayed in the attorney's hotel suite at 
Stewart's expense. Again, because of the pair's long friendship, Brown did not 
see the need to report the hotel stay as a gift, as required by the FPPC. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very reciprocal-type thing for us," the judge said of their 
friendship. "Half the time, I would pick up the tab. . . . That concept of 
avoiding even the appearance of impropriety is a terribly important concept to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of anything I would do for William Stewart that I wouldn't do 
for any other attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 On the occasions when he was a passenger in Stewart's limousine, Brown said it 
usually resulted from a brief discussion about who intended to drive to the 
weekend football game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just happened that Bill had this car that didn't require either of us to 
drive," Brown said, adding that on one of the game days the judge provided 
Bloody Marys and food for the trip. "That was my contribution. I never liked 
limousines. It was never a perk I expected or anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosures about the firm's car service has come during a particularly 
troubling year for Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, other judges alleged that Stewart had been subletting much of his 
contract caseload to other lawyers but continued to share in the contract's 
profits. At the same time, the judges expressed concern about delays in 
resolving criminal cases because the contract attorneys were unavailable for 
court appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials also confirmed that Stewart sometimes communicated with the 
county court system by telephone or fax from his former import-export business 
in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stewart once dismissed his critics in the judiciary as "idiots," the 
concerns prompted judicial higher-ups to review Stewart's work performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were proposals that the judges should divide the lucrative 
business among several law firms, in the end they left it up to Stewart to 
decide whether to share the cases with other firms, or to retain the 
exclusivity he has under the existing contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said then that he would not make a change, especially at a time when 
his performance was being attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney -- known in some legal circles as "Don Guillermo" because of 
former business interests in South America -- has talked with pride of the 
years spent cultivating relationships with local judges, state lawmakers and 
county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 In all those years, though, Stewart said he has never sought special favors 
and has not been the recipient of any. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a big-hearted kind of guy," Judge Brown said, "and a lot of people have 
taken advantage of him. But I wasn't around just because he had a limousine."

SLAIN O.C. TEEN'S MOTHER BOOSTS PROP. 187; ELECTIONS: OPPONENT OF ANTI-ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANT INITIATIVE SAYS GESTURE BY KATHY WOODS, WHOSE SON WAS SLAIN WITH A 
PAINT ROLLER ROD, IS MISGUIDED.

 Kathy Woods, mother of the 17-year-old San Clemente youth slain in a 
confrontation last year, Saturday endorsed Proposition 187, the controversial 
initiative that would deny social services, education and all but emergency 
health care to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our borders were controlled, probably my son would be alive today," said 
Woods, a legal immigrant from England who cannot vote in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday marks the first anniversary of the death of Steven Woods, who was 
killed when a paint roller rod pierced his skull on Oct. 15 as he and friends 
were attempting to drive away from a confrontation with a group of Latino 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the youths have been convicted of charges stemming from the case, one 
has pleaded guilty and two more are awaiting trial. Woods said she believes 
that some of the youths involved are illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I had a wake-up call," Woods said, explaining how her son's death 
had alerted her to illegal immigration. "There are people just like me, who 
have had their head in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 Amin David, president of Los Amigos of Orange County, said Saturday that, 
although Woods' comments "might strengthen the resolve of those who are for 
(Proposition 187), I think she's misguided. . . . I sympathize with the pain of 
a grieving mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the initiative said that when they first began their petition 
drive, they considered calling it the "Steven Woods Memorial Initiative." The 
X-ray of her son's skull was once used in a newsletter by a committee 
supporting Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, the Woods case sparked outrage among Latino leaders who feared that 
racism may have played a role in the filing of the murder charges against the 
Latino defendants.

CLINTON SELLS REALTORS WITH BIPARTISAN APPEAL; POLITICS: EVEN AVID REPUBLICANS 
CREDIT THE PRESIDENT FOR DECRYING DIVISIVENESS DURING SPEECH TO NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION AT ANAHEIM CONVENTION CENTER ARENA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton's plea Saturday for an end to a season of oftenvicious 
partisan politics found its mark among an enthusiastic, largely Republican 
crowd of realtors and others who packed the Convention Center Arena for the 
Democratic President's address. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was magnificent," said Villa Park attorney William A. Dougherty, an avid 
Republican. "I think the man is right. We should not be throwing bombs at each 
other. It has to stop. I think this speech was a great success for him." 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of announcing a new national housing policy initiative, Clinton 
recited a list of his Administration's accomplishments -- from deficit 
reduction to job creation -- and asked the gathering to consider those 
achievements "without regard to your party or philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need in this country so much is to get away from this whole kind of 
negative-dominated way of talking, where we scream at each other instead of 
visiting with each other," Clinton told 5,000 people attending the National 
Assn. of Realtors conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, I don't have all the answers. And, if you try to do as many 
things as I've tried to do, you'll make a mistake or two and I acknowledge 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the audience, including numerous Republicans, seemed to appreciate the 
President's bipartisan appeal. The crowd once rose to its feet and whistled its 
approval. 
</P>

 Clinton's message comes three days before the end of a bitter election year in 
which candidates have flooded the airwaves with intensely negative attacks on 
their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Clinton) tried to bring us together and you have to give him credit for 
that," said Pat Burns, a Newport Beach Republican who surged forward after 
Clinton's speech to shake the President's hand. "I offered my help to him. He 
is our President. I think he spoke from the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Republican convention delegates said Clinton deserved credit for 
"talking about issues that are close to home," as Catherine Richard of Austin, 
Texas, put it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect him for trying to uplift the cynical attitude of the people," 
Richard said. "He talked to the people, not at the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most apolitical assessment of the President's performance Saturday 
came from a pair of realtors, Bert Vis and Andreas Lieberom, who had come from 
the Netherlands to attend the international convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very impressive," the two said in unison, their experience notably enhanced 
when Clinton walked down to the audience after his address and grabbed their 
outstretched hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are people from a small county in the Netherlands, who got to shake hands 
with the most powerful person in the whole world," Lieberom said. "We can't 
believe it. We never expected this, never." 
</P>
<P>
 Long after the President's departure, the two men wandered into the convention 
press room to watch a replay of their encounter with Clinton, slapping each 
other's backs when their faces appeared on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him he had done well with his speech," Vis said, adding that the pair 
had already been exposed to American politics at its worst via television 
commercials at their hotel. "He was right on the button." 
</P>
<P>
 There were some local Democratic faces in the crowd who offered their 
unabashed support for Clinton's appearance and message. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could just see the chemistry he developed with the audience," said Wylie 
Aitken, an attorney and chairman of the Orange County Democratic Foundation. 
"It was classic Bill Clinton. He recognized the opposition in the air and got 
right to the root of the problem. I think that stunned them." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Councilman Irv Pickler, a Democrat who is running for a seat in 
the state Assembly, also gushed his approval of the President's message. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done the best job I know of but doesn't get the credit because of all 
the partisan political stuff that goes on," the longtime councilman said. "All 
we are doing is hurting ourselves with all this fighting between Republicans 
and Democrats. It's got to end. I'm getting too old for it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton came in here, foreign political turf really, and handled himself 
well," Pickler said. "He did an excellent job." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton reserved time for some partisan politics of his own, attending a 
private reception for local Democrats immediately after his address. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob McDonough, a San Juan Capistrano businessman who was invited to the 
reception inside the Convention Center, said the President talked of his hope 
that public opinion would turn against Proposition 187, the state ballot 
measure that would deny social services, public education and non-emergency 
health care to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 During the reception, McDonough said, Clinton appeared optimistic that 
Californians would vote against the measure and for Dianne Feinstein and 
Kathleen Brown, the Democratic candidates for the U.S. Senate and governor, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President expressed the opinion that both (Feinstein and Brown) have 
every possibility to come out the winners," McDonough said.

10-HOUR, 4-DAY SCHEDULE JUST ISN'T WORKING OUT; LABOR: MANY FIRMS SAY WAGE LAWS 
LIMIT FLEXIBILITY, AND WORKERS FIND PACE GRUELING. A 9-HOUR SYSTEM WITH 
ALTERNATE FRIDAYS OFF IS GAINING FAVOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Margie Pohl, personnel manager at Tropitone Furniture Inc., says the 10-hour, 
four-day workweek at her factory here was a bust. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight hours of welding and machining aluminum patio furniture, worker 
productivity fell sharply, according to Pohl. "It was just grueling for our 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Tropitone thus had to operate on Fridays, to make up for the lost productivity 
and fill shipment orders. After a year of having to pay hefty overtime wages, 
the company abandoned the 10-hour work days. "It just cost us too much," Pohl 
said, although she declined to provide a figure. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-day workweek has been well received by some companies. But as more 
businesses in California and nationwide adopt shorter workweeks, hoping for 
financial and environmental benefits, a growing body of evidence is emerging 
that the four-day work schedule is not living up to expectations for most 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in California, where companies complain that they have little 
flexibility to run such schedules effectively because of the state's wage laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Tropitone isn't alone in trying and later abandoning the four-day workweek. 
Companies that have stuck with the schedule suggest that it has had mixed 
results. And some -- seeing weaknesses in the 10-hour workdays -- are instead 
opting for the 9/80 plan in which employees get every other Friday off by 
putting in nine hours of work Monday through Thursday, plus eight hours on 
alternate Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The four-day workweek has not worked out very well at all," said Willie 
Washington of the California Manufacturers Assn., which has 900 member 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington attributes the problems largely to the state's restrictive wage 
regulations. At their core is a law that requires employers to pay daily 
overtime wages for work performed past eight hours a day, whereas in most other 
states time-and-one-half pay kicks in only after 40 hours in a workweek. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way a business in this state can legally run a compressed work 
schedule is by first getting two-thirds approval from its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers and employees can initiate the vote for a shortened workweek, and 
either can rescind it. But for workers to do so, they must wait a year. 
Employers can remove it at any time, but to switch back they must seek another 
two-thirds approval. Companies say that limits their ability to operate fluid 
work schedules to meet seasonal needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers on compressed work schedules have the additional requirement of 
guaranteeing 40 hours of work each week to employees. Plus they cannot schedule 
more than 10 hours of work a day, which means companies with continuous 
operations can't install, say, two shifts of 12 hours each. 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly what Inland Container Corp., a Indianapolis-based company, 
wants to do at its paper mill in Ontario. Personnel manager Larry Gravette said 
Inland Container's mills in other states operate on such 12-hour shifts. "It's 
just more of an economic disadvantage" for California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Aubry, director of the state's Industrial Relations Department, said 
that however inflexible the wage rules may be, "this was not imposed on them. 
Manufacturers and their representatives agreed to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Aubry said the state's wage provisions were originally enacted to protect 
workers and have become more flexible in recent years. But noting that 
employers have complained about the inflexibility, he said, "It's something 
that the Industrial Wage Commission will have to take a look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, who temporarily lifted the daily overtime requirements after 
the Northridge earthquake to help workers and businesses recover, said he 
thinks the daily overtime rule should be permanently removed. Wilson urged the 
next legislative session to create a bill that would do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, experts say, 25% or more of large companies offer a four-day work 
schedule for at least some of their employees. But in California, that figure 
is probably closer to 15%, said Matthew Bartosiak, a senior consultant at the 
Employers Group trade organization in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since mid-1989, when labor officials began tracking factories on compressed 
workweeks, 537 manufacturers -- including 80 in Orange County -- have reported 
converting, mostly to the four 10-hour-day workweek. But experts said many of 
these companies have since dropped their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Beaulieu, personnel manager at Tolo Inc., a Santa Ana manufacturer of 
metal and plastic components, which had been on a four-day workweek, said: "A 
few weeks ago, we got out of it." He declined to provide further details, 
saying only that management decided to discard it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recent nationwide surge in employers going to compressed work 
schedules, extended 10- and 12-hour work shifts have always been the norm for 
workers like police officers, firefighters and hospital workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many city and county governments, because of declining tax revenues, routinely 
close on alternate Fridays to cut costs. Most Orange County and some Los 
Angeles County offices operate under the 9/80 plan, though how much the 
closures have saved the governments is now being analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the push for compressed schedules is part of a larger workplace 
trend that has seen most large employers offer staggering hours and flex time 
-- which do not require a worker vote. Flex time gives workers a span of time 
in which to report to work. And by staggering start times companies can better 
comply with state car-pooling requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Increasingly, workers are finding a desperate need for more personal time," 
said Barney Olmsted, co-director of New Ways to Work, a nonprofit resource 
group in San Francisco. Olmsted said more companies are considering the 9/80 
plan, which seems to have had much better results than the four-day workweek. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor Inc., the giant engineering services firm based in Irvine, looked at the 
four-day, 10-hour workweek. But Mark Krouse, Fluor's human resources manager, 
said the 9/80 plan seemed less of a strain to workers. So after a trial run of 
the 9/80 plan in the summer of 1990, Fluor workers overwhelmingly approved it, 
and the new schedule took effect in March, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of Fluor's 3,000 employees in Irvine now work this abbreviated 
schedule, with senior management and others -- including Krouse -- working 
traditional five-day workweeks to handle customer concerns on the off Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 Krouse said the 9/80 plan has helped lift Fluor's average vehicle ridership 
requirements from the South Coast Air Quality Management District from 1.23 in 
1991 to 1.34 this year. (AQMD's goal is 1.5 employees per car.) 
</P>
<P>
 The 9/80 plan has also helped Fluor recruit workers, people like David Neeve. 
"It was a great incentive to work here," said Neeve, 26, who uses the free 
Fridays to work on his MBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide surveys have shown that most workers prefer compressed schedules, 
whether it's the 4/40, the 9/80 or some variation that gives them extra days 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Kirk Wulff, a machine operator at Wesval Inc., an Anaheim company that 
makes controls for aircraft rudders. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every Friday morning, Wulff, 30, tees off at a Birch Hills Golf Course 
in Brea with his neighbor. Home by 10 a.m., he takes care of work around his 
Anaheim house, then picks up his 6-year-old daughter from school. "When my wife 
gets home, we start our weekends," he said with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesval's owner, Kevin Huffer, raves about the four-day workweek too, saying it 
has saved his company as much as $1.80 an hour per worker in overtime expenses. 
"It's worked out fantastically for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some manufacturers, the 9/80 plan isn't really an option because the 
extra hour each work day doesn't boost production or save costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And the four-day, 10-hour workweek has had a punishing toll on some workers, 
especially middle managers caught between production workers and senior 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Boyer, a warehouse manager at the Pacific Fitness factory in Cypress, 
complained: "I'm here at 6 in the morning and I never get out of here. I work a 
hell of a lot of Fridays" to make sure the work is done. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of the excessive work, Boyer said he has given his notice. 
"Personally, the four-day workweek really sucks for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Cooper, president of Pacific Fitness, which makes exercise equipment, 
said most of his employees seem to like fewer work days. But even Cooper could 
not offer a ringing endorsement. His main complaint: At the end of a quarter or 
a fiscal year, when the company needs to ship "everything that doesn't walk," 
he says the company has to operate on Fridays, which is costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say it's doing more good than bad," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tropitone in Irvine, "we just couldn't do without Fridays," said Pohl, the 
personnel manager. "Our customers needed things. They wanted it shipped on 
Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse, Pohl said, workers began to miss one of their regular 
workdays -- some apparently on purpose -- while coming in on Fridays for which 
they were paid at overtime rates. "It didn't take long for employees to figure 
that out," Pohl said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pohl said Tropitone's struggle with the four-day workweek was such that it 
wouldn't matter if the state labor laws loosened up. "I don't think we would 
ever go back to it." Compressed Work Schedules 
</P>
<P>
 * Four forty (4/40): 10 hours of work on four days, usually Monday through 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nine eighty (9/80): 36 hours of work one week (nine hours, Monday through 
Thursday with Friday off) and 44 hours the next week (nine hours Monday through 
Thursday and eight hours on Friday). 
</P>
<P>
 * Flex time: Gives employees the option of changing their starting and ending 
times daily within a preset range, (e.g. workers begin between 7 and 9 a.m. and 
leave between 3 and 5 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Staggered working hours: Employers stagger their workers' starting and 
ending times, generally by 15 minutes to 2 hours, so that all workers don't 
arrive or leave at once.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: PACIFIC GULF REPORTS $794,000 PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Gulf Properties Inc., a Newport Beach real estate investment trust, 
reported a profit of $794,000, or 19 cents a share, for the third quarter.That 
contrasted with a loss of $69,000 for the comparable 1993 period. Revenue 
increased 58% to $6.8 million from $4.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The company said the 1993 results did not reflect the effect of acquisitions 
or its public stock offering and related organization transactions, which were 
completed in February. For the period from Feb. 18 to Sept. 30 this year, 
Pacific Gulf reported a loss of $884,000, or 21 cents a share, which included a 
loss of $3 million from extinguishment of debt. Revenue for the period was 
$15.6 million.

IN NEED OF COMFORT? LOOK AT SERIES EE BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As interest rates move up, so do the advantages of holding good old plain 
vanilla Series EE U.S. Savings Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a comfort for some people, one of the few investments you can still 
physically take hold of, a possible college investment and a wonderful 
emergency fund," said Dee Lee, a Harvard, Mass., financial planner. 
</P>
<P>
 They are now paying more than they have since March, 1993. The Treasury 
Department announced last week that the average rates on the bonds would be 
5.92% through April 30. 
</P>
<P>
 That's an increase from the 4.7% that had been in effect for the previous six 
months and not a bad figure considering that the interest they pay is exempt 
from state and local income taxes (and in some cases federal income tax). 
Moreover, the bonds are fully backed by the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 You can buy a bond for as little as $25 or as much as $5,000 at just about any 
bank, Federal Reserve Bank or through automatic payroll deduction plans. Hold 
it for at least five years and you will earn the higher of 1) the average of 
the semiannual rates for the period you held the bond or 2) the guaranteed 
minimum, which is currently 4%. Hold it only six months and you'll at least get 
the guaranteed minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Lee suggests that Savings Bonds make a good emergency fund: They 
tend to beat money market mutual fund returns but can easily be cashed in when 
you need them. They also offer a bit of a psychological incentive to be 
tough-minded about what you consider an emergency: You might drain your 
emergency bank account for a good suit sale or a broken VCR; you'd be a little 
less likely to cash in your Savings Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Series EE bonds offer interest rate protection that comparable long-term 
savings vehicles don't: Lock up a certificate of deposit for five years and you 
get the rate announced today, for five years, no matter what rates do. But 
because the Treasury declares a new average rate for Series EE bonds every six 
months, their returns will float up as interest rates do. 
</P>
<P>
 The average rate is based on a formula of 85% of the previous six months' 
average market rate on Treasury notes and bonds with five years until maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the Series EE bond gives you a little bit of short-term protection (cash 
out whenever you want, rates are adjusted every six months) and a little bit of 
long-term yield. 
</P>
<P>
 They also offer some college savings advantages worth considering. If you earn 
less than $66,200 and cash in your bonds to foot your child's tuition bills, 
the cumulative interest is tax-free.

 T his week in the NFL . . . 
</P>
<P>
 ANAHEIM -- Chris Miller, who cannot remember names, dates, passing plays or 
poker hands since sustaining a concussion two weeks ago, will not start at 
quarterback for the Rams today against the Denver Broncos. Instead, Chuck Knox 
goes with Chris Chandler, who can remember sitting on the bench in 
Indianapolis, Tampa and Phoenix. Rams, at home, playing a 3-5 opponent that was 
once 0-4, are 2 1/2-point underdogs.

 KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Big grudge match here as ex-Chief and current Raider 
tailback Harvey Williams asks himself, "Who's laughing loudest now?" and the 
Chiefs ask themselves, "Who is Harvey Williams again?"

 ATLANTA -- The Falcons, 5-0 after bye weeks, are dumbfounded by the Chargers' 
decision to start Gale Gilbert, whose entire NFL career has been a bye week. 
The last time Gilbert started and won a football game -- 1984 -- he was a 
senior at California and the Falcons were quarterbacked by Dave Archer, coached 
by Dan Henning and led by foreign exchange field-goal kicker Mick Luckhurst.

 PHILADELPHIA -- Buddy Ryan returns to Philadelphia, startled to learn 
Philadelphia is still standing. Buddy picks up a tabloid newspaper and finds 
that the home football team is 6-2. The star quarterback, Randall Cunningham, 
is the same one he benched midway through a 1990 playoff game, the last game 
Buddy coached for the Eagles. The star running back, Charlie Garner, is a 
rookie, a species Buddy usually confines to the practice squad. "They don't 
know what the &! they're doing," Buddy scoffs as he watches his new 
quarterback, Steve Beuerlein, hand the ball to Larry Centers on first, second 
and third down while the Cardinal punt team warms up.

 TAMPA -- Buccaneers Coach Sam Wyche is concerned about his team's emotional 
well-being as Tampa Bay hosts Chicago in a crucial NFL schedule-filler. Last 
week, the Baltimore Sun polled readers as to whether they preferred the 
Buccaneers or the Rams coming to town in 1995 -- and the Buccaneers finished 
last, receiving just 14.5% of the vote. The Rams got 41.7%. "No Team," an 
inspired choice, topped the poll, drawing 43.8%.

 HOUSTON -- The Oilers continue to reel from their ill-fated off-season 
decision to appease the Bubba faction of their fan base by ridding themselves 
of effete-sounding, no-good Yankee quarterback Warren and replacing him with

 MILWAUKEE -- The Packers host the Lions in a matchup of bitter NFC Central 
rivals, since both are 4-4 and one's likely to be trailing Minnesota by three 
games in the standings by day's end. If not for the NFL's overtime system, the 
Lions would be 1-4-3, although Barry Sanders told the Detroit media last week 
that "We could win the Super Bowl with Wayne (Fontes)." Sanders also said he 
believes Fontes has the team headed in the right direction. The NFL office 
immediately fined the Lions for failing to disclose Sanders' post-concussion 
syndrome in their Week 10 injury report.

 MIAMI -- Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino is expected to move into second place 
on the NFL career passing yardage list today, needing 150 yards to surpass Dan 
Fouts' total of 43,040, which would keep Marino on pace to break Fran 
Tarkenton's league record of 47,003 yards by the middle of the 1995 season. 
Indianapolis, meanwhile, starts Don Majkowski.

 MINNEAPOLIS -- Fully recovered from running back kicks and punts for 347 yards 
against the Rams -- he had a bye last week -- Tyrone Hughes camps under the 
football once as the Saints take on the Vikings at the Metrodome. Last season, 
after Hughes returned a kick 99 yards to beat the Vikings, 17-14, Minnesota 
Coach Dennis Green fired his special teams coach and hired a new one. In 
Anaheim, Rams special teams coach Wayne Servier remains gainfully employed, 
with Chuck Knox assuring fans that all problems have been solved, now that 
David Lang has returned.

 SEATTLE -- The Cincinnati Bengals, who start Jeff Blake at quarterback today

January '92, makes his first start of the '94 season. He makes it for 
Cleveland. He had been backing up Vinny Testaverde, but Testaverde, the 
23rd-rated quarterback in the league, suffered a concussion last Sunday. In

 IRVING, Tex. -- It's Monday Night Football from Texas Stadium, Giants against

"Murphy Brown"?

TRICK PLAY ELEMENTARY FOR SCURLOCK; PACIFIC 10: ARIZONA CORNERBACK INTERCEPTS 
HALFBACK OPTION PASS AND RETURNS IT 97 YARDS FOR TOUCHDOWN IN 13-6 VICTORY OVER 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 No. 18 Arizona defeated old nemesis California, 13-6, Saturday night without 
an offensive touchdown -- but not without controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Scurlock had a 97-yard interception return for a touchdown in the first 
quarter, but televised replays showed he stepped out of bounds at the Cal 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how they could miss it," Cal Coach Keith Gilbertson said. 
"Everyone upstairs said he was out of bounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbertson also was upset about the officials' call that Cal quarterback Pat 
Barnes was downed at the two-yard line on a scramble three plays before the 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbertson said his quarterback actually reached the end zone. "We were in; 
his leg wasn't down," he said. "I'm anxious to see the film and I'm anxious to 
have the league see the film. . . . With the kind of season we've had, we don't 
get those breaks. It's been nine games of frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, 7-2 overall and 5-1 in the Pacific 10, remained tied with Oregon and 
USC for the league lead. 
</P>
<P>
 California (3-6, 2-4) had won five of the last six games in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McLaughlin kicked field goals of 54 yards, longest of his career, and 42 
yards at the end of Arizona's first two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, Barnes' 50-yard pass to Na'il Benjamin carried Cal to 
the Arizona 20, and three plays later Barnes scrambled 11 yards to the 
Wildcats' two. 
</P>
<P>
 On third-and-goal, Barnes pitched to Tyrone Edwards, who looped a halfback 
pass toward Barnes in the left of the end zone. But Scurlock, a cornerback, 
picked off the pass at the three and headed down the right sideline, scoring 
with 20 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just followed the quarterback and reacted, then I ran down the sideline and 
prayed to God I wouldn't get caught," Scurlock said.

SECOND-HALF EFFORT LIFTS BREA-OLINDA PAST MAGNOLIA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda scored three second-half touchdowns to beat Magnolia, 27-13, in 
Orange League play Saturday night at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (7-1-1, 3-0-1) clinched a Southern Section playoff berth, but 
they still need a victory on Friday against Valencia to wrap up the league 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels (1-8, 0-4) scored on their first possession on Sean Roy's 
three-yard run with 7 minutes 7 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels held Brea-Olinda at bay the next two possessions, but the 
Wildcats managed to score in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Jerome Owens, who ran for 170 yards in 28 carries, carried the 
ball seven times for 56 yards on the drive, setting up a nine-yard pass from 
Matt Kalcevich to Jacob Freeze with 3:25 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels had two touchdowns called back by penalties in the last minute 
of the half, leaving the score tied, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats looked like a different team in the second half. Owens carried 
the ball on seven of the Wildcats' eight plays in their opening drive of the 
third quarter, capping the drive with a one-yard run on fourth and goal for a 
14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda scored on its next possession when Kalcevich hit Freeze for a 
28-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia cut the lead to 21-13 with 4:15 left to play, when backup quarterback 
Josh Reding connected with Eric Webber for a 31-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats capped the scoring when Andy Wirz ran in from one yard with 3:15 
remaining. JON CLIFFORD

SAVANNA'S STRATEGY WORKS WELL AGAINST ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea was to be more physical than Anaheim and control Reuben Droughns. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a great idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna settled for getting some breaks and sending Droughns home frustrated 
and disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna took advantage of two kick returns for touchdowns and scored a 27-24 
victory over Anaheim Saturday at Western High. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, the Rebels (7-2, 3-1) still have a chance to win the Orange 
League title. As for Anaheim (5-3-1, 0-3-1), which began the year with five 
consecutive victories, its season will most likely end after next week's game 
against Magnolia (1-7, 0-4). 
</P>
<P>
 "The team that makes the least mistakes wins," Anaheim Coach Allen Carter said 
of his team's slide. "We've made our share, and they're not just small ones -- 
they're noticeable." 
</P>
<P>
 Daven King took advantage of one of those breakdowns. His third touchdown came 
with 10 minutes 49 seconds left in the game, after he decided at the last 
moment not to fair catch a punt. He bobbled the ball, turning his back to the 
kicking team, gathered the ball in and then began an 82-yard journey that gave 
Savanna a 27-17 lead. It was Savanna's sixth touchdown return of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to juke them a couple of times," King said, "and then the lane opened 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 It ended with King getting into the end zone just ahead of Droughns, who also 
plays defensive back.  
</P>
<P>
 That kind of typified the game. Droughns rushed 34 times for 244 yards and 
three touchdowns, of one, 76 and two yards. A 49-yard run set up Tony Vasquez's 
26-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leading the rushing (standings) is not important to me," Droughns said. "I'd 
like to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, King got that pleasure. He also had a 29-yard run for a touchdown 
that gave Savanna a 13-10 lead, and a 29-yard touchdown reception that gave the 
Rebels a 20-17 lead with 2:40 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 King finished with five carries for 54 yards and two receptions for 41. 
</P>
<P>
 But his heroics might have been for naught had Mike Flores not gotten Savanna 
going. Through the Rebels' first four possessions, they had no drive longer 
than four plays. Then Flores returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown and 
kicked the extra point to cut Anaheim's lead to 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a lot of areas, they outplayed us," Savanna Coach Fred Di Palma said. 
"Droughns is a great football player and we were hoping to contain him a little 
bit. Fortunately, we made some big plays."

ROUNDUP; EDISON GIRLS WIN CROSS-COUNTRY TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Edison girls' cross-country team made the most of the day it had been 
waiting for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday at Central Park in Huntington Beach, the Chargers won the Sunset 
League team title by outrunning Esperanza, which had ended its six-year 
dual-meet winning streak Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison, ranked fourth in the county and second in the State Division II poll, 
used its superior depth to turn back the Aztecs, 47-56, placing three runners 
among the race's top nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Elyse Homberger ran to a fifth-place finish in 19 minutes 3 seconds. 
Twins Jennifer and Jeannie Formosa (19:19 and 19:33) were eighth and ninth for 
the victors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have to say that this is the most exciting win ever," said Edison Coach 
Kristi McGihon, who coached the Chargers to the State Division II title last 
fall. "It's always better to get a team after you lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's Courtney Pugmire assumed the lead from the start, eventually 
leading the pack to the finish in 18:13, ahead of Los Alamitos freshman Kim 
Bates (18:32), Aztec senior Carrie Caulkins (18:44) and Fountain Valley junior 
Angie Winkler (18:58). 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want anyone by me so I told my coach that I was going to go out 
hard," said Pugmire, runner-up in the Orange County meet this fall. "I love to 
run alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Running alone almost cost Pugmire her title, as a wrong turn after the mile 
mark turned into a post-meet protest. 
</P>
<P>
 After a meeting with league coaches, meet director and Huntington Beach Coach 
Eric Anderson ruled Pugmire would not be disqualified because the course was 
not properly marked. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos earned the third and final automatic berth to the Southern 
Section preliminaries by holding off fourth-place Fountain Valley, 59-84. 
</P>
<P>
 The Edison boys (47 points) edged Esperanza (50) and Huntington Beach (53) to 
win the team title, but it was Oiler Tony Trueba who stole the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore spotted Edison junior Kent Roberts 30 yards in the race's early 
going, before chasing down the Charger in the final mile to win in 15:51. 
</P>
<P>
 "My coach and I had a plan to get him on the hill," said Trueba, who improved 
from a 13th-place finish as a freshman. "I wasn't really worried about the 
pain, I just wanted to get the league championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts finished second in 15:58; Steve Wucetich of Los Alamitos (16:03) and 
Huntington Beach standouts Travis Fisher (16:09) and Dan Gaston (16:24) 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the consolation round of the Santa Barbara girls' volleyball tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor 3, Santa Barbara 0 -- After suffering their first loss of the 
season to San Jose Archbishop Mitty Friday night, the Sailors (25-1) bounced 
back behind 16 kills from Misty May to win, 15-9, 15-9, 15-6. In an earlier 
game, Newport Harbor defeated Laguna Beach, 15-8, 15-9, 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague water polo: 
</P>
<P>
 Marina 14, Capistrano Valley 11 -- Stever O'Rourke had seven goals and Erik 
Larsono added four for host Marina (16-11). 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 15, Coronado 6 -- John Hewko had five goals and Jordan Hewko 
added four for host San Clemente (24-2).

 Orange Lutheran rushed for 293 yards and four touchdowns to defeat Brethren 
Christian, 28-7, in an Olympic League game Saturday night at Artesia High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers (7-2, 3-1 in league), who will play at undefeated Valley Christian 
on Friday for the league championship, scored on their first possession when 
Matt Stratton ran in from 32 yards to give Orange Lutheran a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Smith's interception on the opening play of the second quarter gave the 
Lancers the ball on Brethren Christian's 26-yard line. Six plays later, running 
back Che Holloway scored on a two-yard dive. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran took a 21-0 third-quarter lead when quarterback Joe Juliano 
kept the option and ran seven yards into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth and two, Brethren Christian (1-8, 0-4) scored when quarterback Ryan 
Babcock ran 63 yards for a touchdown to cut Orange Lutheran's lead to 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers bounced back with an eight-play scoring drive capped by Stratton's 
second touchdown, a 24-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors had one last opportunity to score, driving to Orange Lutheran's 
seven-yard line, but Smith intercepted Babcock in the end zone with 3:54 left 
to play. JASON HILL

COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; DONS BLOW OUT SOUTHWESTERN, 72-21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Four touchdowns in 39 seconds. Really. No kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago pulled off the seemingly impossible feat in a 72-21 blowout of 
Southwestern in a Mission Conference Central Division game Saturday at Santa 
Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The firestorm of points started when Ernie Wilson scored on a 17-yard run with 
37 seconds left in the half. The touchdown put the Dons ahead, 23-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern then had the ball for one play but quarterback Leon Mayette, who 
was hit by Ray Gonzalez, fumbled. Allen Whitten recovered the ball at the 
Southwestern 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Simon Fuentes completed a touchdown pass to Mike Windsor on the 
next play and the Dons were ahead, 30-7, with 22 seconds left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two very high and somewhat short kickoffs by Casey Wilson set up the next two 
touchdowns. Wilson also made 10 extra points. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern's William Faulkner started to run before he got control of the 
ensuing kickoff and fumbled the ball. Fernando Salas returned it 24 yards for a 
touchdown with seven seconds left and Rancho Santiago was ahead, 37-7. 
</P>
<P>
 No one for Southwestern bothered to field the next kickoff and and Rancho 
Santiago's Peter Veazey grabbed it at the Apaches' 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Fuentes completed a 13-yard scoring pass to tight end Casey 
Shine two seconds into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes, despite playing less than two quarters, had three touchdown passes, 
giving him 16 this season. He needs one more to set a Rancho Santiago 
single-season record. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the seventh in a row for Rancho Santiago (7-1, 4-0), which is 
the second-ranked team in Southern California. The Dons are eighth in the J.C. 
Grid-Wire national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the one-sided victory didn't please Rancho Santiago Coach Dave Ogas as 
much as some might expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to be on either side of scores like this," he said. "It's hard 
to keep the intensity up." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago will need a more complete effort Saturday when the Dons play 
Fullerton for first place in the division in a 7 p.m. game at Titan Stadium. 
The teams are tied at 4-0 in the division with two games left. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern is 0-7-1, 0-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Mission Conference game: 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West 21, Saddleback 21 -- Shad Hinchen returned a punt 89 yards for a 
touchdown with 1:03 left to play, earning the Gauchos (1-5-2, 1-1-2) the tie at 
Orange Coast College and spoiling the Rustlers' (2-5-2, 2-2-1) homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West took a 21-10 lead with 4:09 left in the third quarter when Damien 
Cook scored on a two-yard run. Cook rushed for a game-high 149 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos closed the gap to 21-13 on a 36-yard Tim Knutson field goal, then 
earned the tie in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinchen took the Donny McMahan punt at his 11, found a gap down the right 
sideline, and went the distance for the score. It was the longest punt return 
touchdown in Saddleback history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos scored both touchdowns with their punt return team on the field. 
In the first quarter, a bad Rustler snap from punt formation got loose in the 
end zone and Deric Darensbourg fell on it for a Gaucho score.

CHAPMAN FLATTENS AN UNDERMANNED POMONA-PITZER; FOOTBALL: PANTHERS SPOT THE 
SAGEHENS AN EARLY LEAD BEFORE STORMING BACK TO WIN, 61-14. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Chapman scored 54 consecutive points and routed a depleted Pomona-Pitzer, 
61-14, Saturday night at Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time the Panthers have scored at least 59 points in their 
first football season in 62 years. This one was so one-sided that the referee 
mercifully let the clock run after some incomplete passes in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was long over by then. Pomona-Pitzer (1-7), which started the night 
with 27 healthy players on the sideline, lost three starters to injury, 
including its starting quarterback. Chapman (5-2-1), which spotted the Sagehens 
a 14-7 second-quarter lead, went ahead, 24-14, at the half and scored 30 points 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lost some people who could have helped keep the game closer," Chapman 
Coach Ken Visser said. "And once it starts to go, it's hard to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman gained 482 yards in total offense, all but 95 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Darnell Morgan rushed for 133 yards and three touchdowns in 11 carries. 
Quarterback Curtis Robinson rushed for 93 yards and a touchdown and passed for 
65 yards and another score. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Ford rushed for 76 and a touchdown and caught a 44-yard touchdown pass 
from Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the beginning, Pomona-Pitzer seemed to be capable of staying in the 
game. The Sagehens sliced through Chapman's defense early, scoring on long 
drives on two of their first three possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we came in thinking we were going to blow them down," Chapman 
defensive lineman Robert Ernster said. "But they got those two big drives and 
we knew we were in for a good game." 
</P>
<P>
 That's pushing it, but you could see why the Panthers were worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona-Pitzer quarterback Jack Ramirez was finding plenty of open receivers 
and running back Robert Hicks was finding room to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez scored twice on one-yard sneaks, completing drives of 72 and 76 yards, 
giving Pomona-Pitzer a 14-7 lead with 12 minutes 49 seconds left in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Sagehens wouldn't move the ball effectively again. After Bill Hamlin 
cut the lead to 14-10 with a 32-yard field goal, Chapman got the ball back on a 
punt and four plays later Morgan scored on a 19-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 On Pomona-Pitzer's next possession, Atlas Helaire intercepted his second pass 
of the game, giving the Panthers the ball at the Pomona-Pitzer 37. Robinson 
then scored on a 19-yard scramble for a 24-14 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Panthers were revving up their defense. Pomona-Pitzer, which 
gained 47 yards on the ground in the first half, had minus 45 yards in the 
second. Most of the negative yards came on five sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernster and Toney Eggleston each had two sacks and Jeremy Simmons had one. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggleston also had Ramirez in his grasp in the end zone in the third quarter. 
Ramirez tried to throw the ball away but was called for intentional grounding. 
The safety gave Chapman a 33-14 lead with 11:47 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to let teams know that if you come to play here you are in for a long 
night," Ernster said. "I think we got the point across."

FULLERTON RALLIES IN SECOND HALF TO ROLL PAST ORANGE COAST, 35-9 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said his team was forbidden to even whisper the 
words Rancho Santiago, but the Hornets might have been guilty of thinking about 
next week's showdown after a sluggish start against Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton struggled for a half, then blitzed the Pirates with a 28-point 
second half for a 35-9 Mission Conference Central Division victory Saturday at 
Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets (5-2-1, 4-0), who trailed, 9-7, at halftime, rallied on two 
touchdown runs by James Sebreros and one apiece by Jeff Willis and Mike Jacot, 
who ran for a season-high 139 yards in 14 carries. Jacot is the first Fullerton 
runner to top 100 yards this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast (1-7, 1-3) scored on its second possession and recorded a safety 
late in the first quarter before Fullerton took control. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's defense sacked quarterback Matt Sauk six times for minus-59 yards 
and limited tailback Jeff Clayton to 25 yards in 13 carries. O'Brien completed 
20 of 29 passes for 251 yards. Two of his passes were intercepted by Travis 
McCullough. Fullerton's Chris Johnson caught seven passes for 102 yards.

HE'S THE PIED PIPER OF SEXAGENARIANS; TRIATHLON: WITH DRIVE AND TRAINING 
REGIMEN OF A YOUNGER MAN, CORONA DEL MAR'S ERIC PIPER IS LEADER OF THE 
60-AND-OLDER PACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Eric Piper was heading past Keahole Airport and down the slight grade into 
Kailua-Kona feeling pretty good . . . OK, as well as a 60-year-old man who has 
swum 2 1/2 miles in the Pacific, cycled 112 miles and run about 20 miles 
through Hawaii's scorching fields of black lava can feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper was a few miles shy of winning his age group in the Gatorade Ironman, 
the world's most prestigious triathlon, and apparently the endorphins had 
really kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my buddies on the course said, 'You're way out in front, take it 
easy.' But I got a little carried away," Piper said. "I really started to go 
for it coming down the hill into town. I dropped the pace under seven (minutes 
per mile) and was passing guys. I felt like a kid again." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Piper had made the final turn in downtown Kailua-Kona and was 
about a half-mile short of the finish, he began to feel his age, and then some. 
Within seconds, a slight twinge had erupted into a full-fledged back spasm and 
the Pied Piper of sexagenarians had become the hunchback of Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a huge crowd, they estimated it around 10,000, and I ran the last 
400 hundred yards bent over like I was looking for coins," he said. "My 
daughter came running out to guide me along the last few yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Piper collapsed at the finish, 11 hours 46 minutes 57 seconds after he started 
and more than 48 minutes ahead of the the next competitor in the 60-64 age 
group. He was helped to an aid station, got a massage and was in good enough 
shape to celebrate that night at a local restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had walkie-talkies and were very aware of dad's splits and where he stood 
against the rest of the competition in his age group," Piper's son, Eric Jr., 
said. "We were pretty excited, but it was intense there at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were worried because we didn't know what was wrong. But it turned out he 
was fine and then we could appreciate what a great performance it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Piper's wife, Berry, was more thankful that her husband was able to stand 
upright than she was about the victory. "That was not a happy sight, not what I 
had anticipated," she said. "Yeah, it scared me. But Eric is Eric, and he's 
been this way forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always had a goal and he puts himself on the line for it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Piper had emerged from the ocean in a pack with three others in his age group, 
trailing the 60-64 age-group leader, Jim Gaughran, by 13 minutes. Ahead awaited 
138.2 miles of cycling and running in 50-m.p.h. winds, heat that reached 110 
degrees on the pavement and 86% humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cleared the transition area ahead of those other two and never saw them 
again," Piper said. "About the 75-mile mark, (Donahue) Wildman of Malibu, who 
had won the division last year, passed me. There was an NBC camera crew 
following him so I knew it was him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stayed with him though, trying to stay the minimum of four bike lengths 
back, because it's illegal to draft. He had one of those little mirrors on his 
helmet so he could see me behind him. He tried to break away a couple of times, 
but I stayed with him. Then he wanted me to pass, but I wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Piper and Wildman played cat and mouse for the remainder of the cycle ride, 
with Piper growing increasingly confident because running has always been his 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we got on the run," he said, "within a half-mile, he was dust." 
</P>
<P>
 Four miles later, Piper caught Gaughran and ran away from the early leader, 
who was still out on the course long after Piper was getting that massage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a long day," Piper said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, but also relatively short in some respects. Piper's time would have 
been good enough for third place in the 55-59 age group and 10th in the 50-54 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, his remarkable feat almost pales in comparison to the training 
regimen he subjected himself to every day for more than two months before the 
Oct. 15 event. 
</P>
<P>
 On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, Piper swam 3,500 yards at UC Irvine and 
then ran eight miles on the roads around his Corona del Mar home. On Tuesdays 
and Thursdays, he rode his bike for 70 miles and ran eight miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekends off? Not exactly. On Saturdays, he ran 20 to 28 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundays, a little rest? 
</P>
<P>
 Very little. On Sundays, he rode his bike 95 miles . . . and then ran eight 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two keys to being competitive on this level," Piper said. "The 
first is quality workouts. Not just the mileage but you have to train with 
people who are better than you, who can pull you up to another level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I train in the pool with the UCI masters program, and I ride on the weekends 
with the Santiago Cycle Club in Tustin. Both places, they pull me along. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secondly, you have to hold up without breaking down through all the training 
and I've been very fortunate to remain injury free." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to diet and workouts, Piper fits the description of fitness 
fanatic, but surprisingly he has no use for weightlifting or stretching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never lifted weights and I do very little stretching," he said. "I think 
the swimming keeps me stretched out pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a third factor necessary to success at this level: time. Piper 
trained 28 hours a week before the Ironman and also managed to put in pretty 
close to a full day Monday through Friday at his Fullerton business. He's a 
manufacturing representative, selling cans and packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 And, no, he doesn't retire to his office and take a nap. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the same way in the office as he is out competing," said Eric Jr., who 
works with his father. "He's a great motivator and a great inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 Piper Sr. began his athletic career as swimmer at the Flushing YMCA in New 
York and continued as a swimmer and lacrosse player at Hofstra University. His 
endurance running career began in the Marine Corps in the late '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came off active duty in 1960, and the long-distance running craze was just 
beginning," Piper said. "I started running marathons in the early '70s. I ran 
in the Boston Marathon five times and finished in less than three hours each 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I started running some ultra-marathons. I ran the 54-mile 
London-to-Brighton race a couple of times. Then, in the late '70s, this 
triathlon thing started up, and since I'd done some swimming as a kid, I 
thought maybe I could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Piper competed in the 1981 Ironman and finished in 12 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always OK in the water and the running would pull me through," he said, 
"but the bike was my weak link. This year, I decided to really concentrate on 
improving my bike leg." 
</P>
<P>
 All that pedaling has paid off. In the spring, he won his age group in the 
National Amateur short-course and long-course triathlon championships, a feat 
accomplished by only one other amateur triathlete. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper plans to take it easy for a while, then resume training for next season. 
It will be tough to top 1994, but he'll keep sloshing, churning and chugging. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always ask me why the hell I keep doing it," he said. "I've been 
married to my wife for 38 years, and I know she's still wondering." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Piper isn't ready to retire. But he might take it a bit easier . . . 
for a while, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'll back off a little now and then get serious again when I'm 65," he 
says, smiling. "It's best to really go for it when you're the youngest of your 
age group. In this sport, age really catches you." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but you wouldn't know it by looking at Eric Piper. After all, nobody is 
catching him.

<P>
 U.S. Senate: DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D). Why take a chance with a relative unknown? 
Especially when the incumbent is terrifically effective? Feinstein is a 
powerful voice for California in the U.S. Senate and richly deserves 
reelection.

</P>
<P>
 Governor: PETE WILSON (R). Kathleen Brown is fresh and determined but the 
experienced and capable Wilson, though wrong about Proposition 187, is right 
about a lot of other things and merits a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieutenant Governor: GRAY DAVIS (D). The longtime state controller offers 
experience and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State: TONY MILLER (D). Miller, the acting secretary of state, 
promises to curb voter fraud and clear the deadwood from voter registration 
rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Controller: KATHLEEN CONNELL (D). Formerly an investment banker, Connell would 
bring sharp, modern management ideas to government. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer: MATT FONG (R). Fong gets the nod over Phil Angelides, a quality 
player, because of his comprehensive proposals to increase efficiency and cut 
government costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney General: TOM UMBERG (D). The tough-on-crime Orange County assemblyman 
offers a nuanced approach to crime-fighting.

solid record as an advocate for consumers and has much experience dealing with 
insurance issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Equalization Office No. 4: BRAD SHERMAN (D). Sherman is a solid 
choice and deserves a second term in this important but often overlooked 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent of Public Instruction: DELAINE EASTIN. Maureen DiMarco is also 
a good candidate, but the edge for this nonpartisan office is held by Eastin, a 
Fremont assemblywoman who knows educational issues and has the political acumen 
for this key post. California Legislature

</P>
<P>
 70th -- MARILYN C. BREWER (R) Statewide Propositions 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 181 (Public Transportation Bonds): Authorizes $1 billion in 
general-obligation bonds to fund California's passenger rail transportation 
network. Unwise given the state's heavy debt load. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Proposition 183 (Recall Elections): Attacks wasteful back-to-back 
elections by allowing recall votes to be held as late as 180 days after 
certification. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 184 ("Three Strikes"): This ill-conceived and hugely 
expensive measure would imprison criminals convicted of a third felony (there 
are more than 500 such felonies under California law) for 25 years to life. 
It's dumb criminal justice policy. Worse still, it's unnecessary; legislation 
nearly identical to this initiative took effect last March. Passage would only 
make it harder for the Legislature and the governor to make necessary 
refinements in the existing law. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 185 (Gas Tax/Transportation): This measure, backed by 
Southern Pacific Railroad Co., imposes a 4% sales tax on gasoline. It would 
fund rail projects primarily; other transportation-related needs such as 
seismic retrofitting would be scanted. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 186 (Single-Payer Health Care): Establishes a state-run 
"single-payer" health care insurance plan and creates the post of state health 
commissioner. It sounds good in principle, but it's a big-government nightmare. 
This is one time California doesn't need to be the guinea pig for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 187 (Illegal Immigrants): This counterproductive measure 
would cut schooling, health and social services for the estimated 1.7 million 
illegal immigrants here -- and, even then, not come close to addressing the 
complex problem of immigration, which is rooted in economics. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 188 (Smoking and Tobacco Products): Masquerading as a tough 
anti-smoking measure, this mendacious offering -- paid for by tobacco companies 
-- would in fact emasculate all tough smoking regulations, both local and 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Proposition 189 (Expanding No-Bail Provisions): Amends the Constitution 
to permit courts to deny bail to individuals accused of "felony sexual assault 
offenses" who threaten another with physical harm. Good idea as long as it's 
not abused in implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Proposition 190 (Judicial Performance Commission): Reforms the state's 
Commission on Judicial Performance, which is responsible for disciplining 
errant or incompetent judges. The measure ensures that a majority of commission 
members will be from the public and grants the panel more authority to remove 
or discipline current and former judges. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Proposition 191 (Justice Courts): Eliminates justice courts and merges 
them with the municipal courts in jurisdictions of 40,000 or fewer people. Los 
Angeles County 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 2: TERRY B. FRIEDMAN. This veteran state assemblyman 
and former poverty lawyer has the patience, fairness and compassion to be an 
excellent judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 4: TERI SCHWARTZ. An outstanding prosecutor with the 
hard-core gang division of the L.A. County district attorney's office, Schwartz 
has the respect of her peers for her skill, intelligence and demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 93: MITCHELL BLOCK. In a close call over Susan 
Bryant-Deason, an accomplished prosecutor. Measures in L.A. County 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Los Angeles County, Charter Amendment A: Gives the County Board of 
Supervisors needed flexibility to increase or decrease the compensation for the 
posts of district attorney, assessor and sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- El Rancho Unified School District, Bond Measure C: Permits the El 
Rancho Unified School District in Pico Rivera to issue $13.3 million in 
general-obligation bonds in order to upgrade facilities including fire, 
earthquake, electrical and security systems; provide students with access to 
modern technology; renovate or replace obsolete facilities; construct permanent 
facilities, and make improvements to older buildings on district property. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- La Verne, Lancaster, San Dimas and Walnut, Measures E, F, G and L: An 
advisory vote to support the L.A. County Board of Supervisors' creation of a 
community facilities district (CFD). Property owners in cities that voluntarily 
join the CFD would be subject to a small assessment on their property taxes, 
when needed, to increase materials, hours and days of service at the besieged 
county public library branches in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Long Beach, Bond Measure D: Authorizes the issuance of up to $48 
million in general-obligation bonds to finance improvements to city facilities, 
bringing them into compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act.  
</P>
<P>
 YES -- San Marino, Special Tax I: Extends a special public safety tax for 
paramedic services, police protection and fire protection and prevention. The 
current levy expires in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Santa Monica, Charter Amendment J: Saves the city money by allowing it 
to publish condensed versions of city ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Santa Monica/Malibu Unified School District, Measure K: Permits the 
school district to continue a special tax that funds educational improvements. 
This measure extends the special parcel tax -- $58 a year -- for six years and 
increases it to $68 per parcel. The measure requires a two-thirds majority for 
passage. Orange County Offices

OLD STREET LIGHTS BECOME 'FISHING POLES'; OCEANS: UTILITY COMPANY DONATES 350 
TONS OF CONCRETE FIXTURES TO CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL REEF TO LURE SPORT FISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 About 350 tons of concrete light poles yanked from streets throughout Los 
Angeles and Orange counties were carried by barge from Long Beach to a point 4 
1/2 miles off Bolsa Chica State Beach on Saturday and dumped to the bottom of 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the first of about 3,500 tons of poles, removed by Southern 
California Edison in a street light modernization program, that over the next 
12 months will create a substantial addition to an artificial reef being 
constructed by Southland sport fishermen who are determined to revitalize the 
fish population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fishing used to be great in Southern California and has been terrible in 
recent years and is getting worse," said Jim Paulk, a Huntington Beach resident 
who is president of United Anglers of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The thinning of the local fisheries, Paulk said, has been attributed to many 
factors, including overfishing, pollution and the loss of wetlands to 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison's discarded light poles, which otherwise would have been destined for 
landfills, will be scattered like pickup sticks on the ocean floor. Marine 
biologists say the poles will provide excellent footing for plants and 
barnacles, niches where tiny fish can hide and grow. The reef also will attract 
larger fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a year (the concrete poles) will be teeming with life that will become 
more and more complex with time, and in 10 to 15 years it will be 
indistinguishable from a natural reef," said Dennis Bedford, a marine biologist 
for the California Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides raising tens of thousands of dollars to help fund construction of the 
Bolsa Chica Artificial Reef, United Anglers and its affiliate clubs over the 
last two years have been financing, building and operating facilities to raise 
white sea bass, a tasty and popular sporting fish that has sharply declined in 
Southern California waters over the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny white sea bass are kept in an underwater pen in Newport Harbor and fed by 
volunteers from the Balboa Angling Club. The containment is designed to protect 
them from birds, sea lions and other predators. Officials of another club, the 
Dana Angling Club, said that within a week they will complete construction of 
another facility and place it in Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 These and similar protective pens that fishermen have placed in Marina del 
Rey, Oxnard, Catalina and Redondo Beach will grow fish that have been bred from 
brood stock at Hubbs-Sea World Research Institute in San Diego. And there are 
plans for more, Paulk said, including two pens in Huntington Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say sport fishermen are playing a valuable role in the white 
sea bass replenishment effort. "The sport fishermen have supported this program 
from the very beginning and without them this would not have happened," said 
Michael Domeier, head of Fish and Game's sport fish research group, which is 
monitoring the effectiveness of the artificial breeding program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the first time on the West Coast that local ocean fish populations have 
been enhanced by artificial means," said Bob Denault, a hardware store chain 
executive and president of the Dana Angling Club. 
</P>
<P>
 White sea bass take five years to reach the length of 28 inches required for 
legal fishing, so it will take time for local fishermen to see an improvement 
in their sea bass catch. "It will probably be the year 2000 before we see any 
significant return on this part of the investment," Paulk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Great patience and perseverance have also been required to create the Bolsa 
Chica Artificial Reef, said Russ Izor, a veteran sport fishing boat owner from 
Torrance who is considered the father of the reef. 
</P>
<P>
 Izor said that a decade ago he won a struggle to obtain approval of the 
project from the U.S. Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers and California 
Coastal Commission. Construction of the reef began in 1986, with an initial 
deposit of 5,000 tons of concrete highway rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has not only provided an amazing amount of recreational fishing for people 
from Newport Beach to San Pedro, but it has also provided a habitat for big 
families of fish who were wandering in a void," Izor said. "A fishery needs a 
place to hang their hat like anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa Chica reef is part of a system of 35 artificial reefs that since the 
1950s have been built to promote sporting fish, said Bedford of the Fish and 
Game Department. "A lot of very popular fish for sport fishing are associated 
with rocky habitat where they may hide, reproduce or feed," depending on the 
species, he said. Artificial reefs have been created in Orange County off the 
coasts of Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The placement of these reefs is strategically significant, he said, because 
there is no naturally occurring rocky coastline between the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula and Laguna Beach and "there is a tremendous amount of fishing 
pressure" from Southern California sport fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists argue that artificial reefs serve mostly to attract fish to a 
particular spot -- thus making them easier for fishermen to catch -- and do 
nothing to help the fish population grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gordon LaBedz, chairman of the environmental issues team of the Surfriders 
Foundation, a national environmental group based in San Clemente, said that 
although the foundation does not oppose building artificial reefs, the group 
believes "it is something that needs more science. . . . We would like more 
knowledge on this issue before they line our coast with what is essentially 
garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 David Parker, a marine biologist who supervises Fish and Game's artificial 
reef project, said the department has begun studies at Southern California's 
artificial reefs "to further document and quantify the contribution to (fish) 
productivity the reefs make." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fish and Game officials believe the reefs benefit the fish and other 
marine life. Izor said that over the last eight years the Bolsa Chica reef, 
located 85 feet to 100 feet below the ocean's surface, has attracted kelp bass, 
sand bass, sheep head and sculpin, all popular sport fish. Bedford said the 
older parts of the reef also boast a substantial colony of gorgonians, which he 
described as fan-shaped soft corals, and blacksmith fish, a plankton-eating 
fish that in turn is a favorite food of many sport fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The reef has gradually expanded with various additions of rubble, including 
1,000 tons of manufacturer-rejected concrete fireplaces in 1992 and another 
1,000 tons of concrete in August. Currently, Izor said, the 45-acre reef site, 
with capacity for about 40,000 tons of concrete, is only about a third full. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, United Anglers has collected $30,000 of the $40,000 required to pay 
for transporting all of the 7,500 Southern California Edison poles that will be 
donated over the next year, Paulk said. The funds have been contributed by 
Southern California Edison, Ameron Pole Products, the contractor removing the 
poles, and fishing clubs and individuals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said another 20,000 to 25,000 tons of concrete will have to be donated to 
finish building the reef and another $200,000 will have to be raised to pay for 
barging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dream is to have a great fishing destination for anglers off of 
Huntington Beach," said Paulk.

knowledge on this issue before they line our coast with what is essentially 
garbage."

 David Parker, a marine biologist who supervises Fish and Game's artificial 
reef project, said the department has begun studies at Southern California's 
artificial reefs "to further document and quantify the contribution to (fish) 
productivity the reefs make."

 But Fish and Game officials believe the reefs benefit the fish and other 
marine life. Izor said that over the last eight years the Bolsa Chica reef, 
located 85 feet to 100 feet below the ocean's surface, has attracted kelp bass, 
sand bass, sheep head and sculpin, all popular sport fish. Bedford said the 
older parts of the reef also boast a substantial colony of gorgonians, which he 
described as fan-shaped soft corals, and blacksmith fish, a plankton-eating 
fish that in turn is a favorite food of many sport fish.

 The reef has gradually expanded with various additions of rubble, including 
1,000 tons of manufacturer-rejected concrete fireplaces in 1992 and another 
1,000 tons of concrete in August. Currently, Izor said, the 45-acre reef site, 
with capacity for about 40,000 tons of concrete, is only about a third full.

 So far, United Anglers has collected $30,000 of the $40,000 required to pay 
for transporting all of the 7,500 Southern California Edison poles that will be 
donated over the next year, Paulk said. The funds have been contributed by 
Southern California Edison, Ameron Pole Products, the contractor removing the 
poles, and fishing clubs and individuals, he said. 
</P>

 He said another 20,000 to 25,000 tons of concrete will have to be donated to 
finish building the reef and another $200,000 will have to be raised to pay for 
barging.

 "Our dream is to have a great fishing destination for anglers off of 
Huntington Beach," said Paulk.
