O.C. OPERA REVIEW; 'LUCIA': IT'S DUTIFUL AND DULL DONIZETTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Friday, Opera Pacific swept caution to the Santa Ana winds and ventured 
some lofty, heavyweight Wagner. Honorably. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, the company reverted to dull and dutiful, hand-me-down, 
bargain-basement Donizetti -- via "Lucia di Lammermoor." Business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing went grotesquely wrong with the mellifluous old masterpiece. But, 
apart from some flashes of brilliance from the beleaguered leading lady, not 
much went memorably right, either. 
</P>
<P>
 This, essentially, was a noisy festival of belt-canto. And that isn't a 
typographical error. Grace? Elegance? Finesse? Expressive sensitivity? Forget 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance at the Orange County Performing Arts Center turned out to be a 
model demonstration of ancient, not-so-grand art of instant opera. You know -- 
borrow some generic sets, hire a rising star and surround her with an 
inexpensive collection of would-be's, get a traffic cop to arrange the cast in 
picturesque formations, and find a conductor who can stir the lumpy musical 
broth unobtrusively, then meet the singers at the cadence. 
</P>
<P>
 Presto, questo. . . . It's easy. It's depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news on this occasion was monopolized by Ruth Ann Swenson in the 
title role. Without the support of a stylish conductor and an imaginative stage 
director, she couldn't do much to justify a program blurb that invoked 
comparisons with such disparate paragons as Pons, Callas, Sutherland and Sills. 
Even when seemingly left to her own bland devices, however, she confirmed her 
extraordinary potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice is an astonishingly big and strong lyric-soprano equipped with a 
brilliant top extension. She uses it with reasonable agility and, apart from 
stratospheric climaxes that tend to go sharp, with remarkable accuracy. She 
looks attractively plucky -- actually like a plump and pleasing Tonya Harding 
-- and she strikes apt poses. 
</P>
<P>
 She managed some breathtaking flights of fancy fiorature in a quaintly 
bloodied Mad Scene. When the spirit moved her, she floated some ravishing 
pianissimo phrases, and seldom stopped for anything so prosaic as the intake of 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she sounded rather rough at the outset, and she did little to shade the 
text or define the heroine's character beyond the customary platitudes. Looking 
basically healthy and only mildly perplexed, she hardly made her ultimate 
descent into melodic madness seem inevitable, much less tragic. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps next time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Hernandez partnered her as a small-scaled, sweet-toned, moderately 
ardent Edgardo afflicted with occasional pitch and focus problems of his own. 
Mark Rucker's burly baritone defined a mean Enrico who would rather roar than 
soar. Under the circumstances, one could hardly lament the omission of the 
Wolf-Crag duet. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen West was suitably dignified, his basso unsuitably loud and not 
terribly steady as Raimondo, a.k.a. Bide-the-bent. The lesser figures seldom 
rose above a mediocre opera-workshop level. 
</P>
<P>
 The ever-enthusiastic chorus, trained by Henri Venanzi, registered energy, 
literally to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Flint conducted with brisk and brusque efficiency. The modest orchestra 
responded with modest generalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman Terleckyj oversaw the fussy entrances and exits within Henry Bardon's 
shabby, quasi-literal, old-fashioned canvas scenery, designed for Dallas 22 
years ago. The warehouse sets were attributed to Peter J. Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At least no one decided to subject the elementally Romantic drama to trendy 
updating. The stage was not cluttered with expressionistic coffins as at the 
Met, and the central image was not a petrified dung heap as at the Music 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Small favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * Even though "Lucia" is one of the world's most popular and most tuneful 
operas, one saw plenty of empty seats in the house. And "Die Walkure" isn't 
selling very well, either. So much for operatic appetites in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interesting attempt to boost box-office action, the management has 
decided to offer an automatic upgrade to anyone who buys tickets at the center 
on Saturday between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Example: A $40 purchase for the rear of 
Tier 2 will actually get the opera-goer a seat in the front, worth $65. 
</P>
<P>
 * The non-capacity opening-night audience was enthusiastic. In the case of the 
crass whistler who pierced ear-drums at every Luftpause, it was too 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the second time in the history of the hall, needy travelers were sold 
coffee during intermissions in the alfresco foyer. The gods can be merciful. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lucia di Lammermoor" presented by Opera Pacific at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, Costa Mesa. Remaining performances tonight, Thursday 
and March 19 at 8 p.m., March 13 at 2 p.m. Tickets ranging from $15 to $75 (see 
incidental intelligence above), at center box office and agencies. Rush seats 
for students and seniors sold at $15 one hour before curtain, if available. 
Additional performance March 23 at the McCallum Theatre in Palm Desert.

MOVIE REVIEW; BY 'PROXY,' THE COENS DAZZLE WITH ICY CONTROL; SET IN THE '50S, 
'HUDSUCKER PROXY' BRILLIANTLY SALUTES '40S FILMMAKING. BUT THE IMPRESSIVE 
VISUAL TRIUMPH LACKS HEART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You have to admire what the Coen brothers have accomplished in "The Hudsucker 
Proxy," but actually enjoying their achievement is a little more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pristine perfectionists who delight in the craft of filmmaking, director Joel 
and producer Ethan have come up with a visual extravaganza, a series of 
gorgeous, technically dazzling set pieces impeccably conceived, designed and 
photographed. But impressive as all this is, it is great filmmaking only from 
the wrists down. 
</P>
<P>
 For if "The Hudsucker Proxy" is a triumph, it is a zombie one. Too cold, too 
elegant, too perfect, more an exhibit in a cinema museum than a flesh-and-blood 
film, "Proxy's" highly polished surface leaves barely any space for an 
audience's emotional connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Though set in 1958, "Hudsucker" is intended as an hommage to several different 
kinds of 1940s films, from fast-talking comedies like the Howard Hawks-directed 
"His Girl Friday" to the jaunty populism of Frank Capra's "Meet John Doe" and 
"It's a Wonderful Life." But this film is so concerned with giving just the 
right tongue-in-cheek twist to its story line it ends up, to quote a very 
different 1940s vehicle, "a little cold around the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 It is in fact a kind of perverse tribute to how icily controlled the Coens' 
world is that "Hudsucker" persists in remaining uninvolving despite a pair of 
brash comic performances from stars Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Leigh that 
would have brought life to another film. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins plays Norville Barnes, a recent graduate of the Muncie College of 
Business Administration who is so boyishly eager to make his mark in commerce 
that his cheeks literally gleam as he steps out of the bus from Indiana in 
bustling New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 A trusting naif, Norville manages to land a job in the hellacious mailroom of 
mighty Hudsucker Industries, assuring his co-workers that he has impressive 
plans for the future involving a mysterious invention intended, he says with a 
grin, "you know, for kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Norville, big things are happening higher up. There 
is a sudden vacancy at the very top of Hudsucker Industries that leaves the 
company vulnerable. But crafty No. 2 man Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman, 
trying perhaps too hard) has a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to install a dunce as CEO, someone guaranteed to drive the stock 
price down so the board of directors can buy the company for a fraction of what 
its worth. "I want a Grade-A ding-dong," Mussburger roars, and, naturally, when 
Norville wanders up from the mailroom, it's clear that the appropriate victim 
has been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Norville thinks this good fortune is simply his due, others are not so 
sure, especially the folks at the Manhattan Argus, the kind of newspaper where 
the reporters call the editor "chief." "The human angle, that's what sells 
papers," this worthy opines and he assigns his ace reporter, the fast-talking 
Amy Archer (Leigh), to get the scoop on unsuspecting Norville. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy, showing the form that's already won her a Pulitzer Prize, finagles her 
way into a job as Norville's secretary, and soon the Argus is running headlines 
like "Imbecile Heads Hudsucker." Naturally Norville is hardly pleased about 
this and, Amy discovers to her chagrin, she is starting to rethink her attitude 
toward the big galoot as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkled through this story are great visual set pieces, starting with a 
gorgeous opening tracking shot over a mock-New York skyline and continuing with 
that cavernous mailroom and assorted high jinks involving open skyscraper 
windows. Production designer Dennis Gassner, working with exquisite effects 
(visual by Michael J. McAlister, mechanical by Peter M. Chesney), has matched 
if not exceeded the wonders he accomplished with "Barton Fink" and "Bugsy," 
both Oscar nominated in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 And even in a brief retelling it is possible to see how much of a kick the 
Coens (who co-wrote the script with Sam Raimi) get out of fooling around with 
venerable movie conventions. They love the old dialogue, lines like "Is this 
guy from Chumpsville?" and "What gives?" and they love the old movie types, 
like Buzz the gabby elevator operator (Jim True) and Smitty the cynical 
reporter (Bruce Campbell). 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they love it all too much. Despite the best and often entertaining 
efforts of Robbins and Leigh, whose zippy comic impersonation of Katharine 
Hepburn doing Rosalind Russell is extraordinary, there is an air of 
self-satisfaction about this excessively derivative project that carefully 
keeps audiences at a distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coens seem to have learned all the lessons old Hollywood had to teach 
except the most important one: You gotta have heart.

 'Arsenio Hall Show' Sued: Three actors filed a sexual-battery complaint 
Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court against Paramount Pictures, "The Arsenio 
Hall Show" and writer Lawrence Amoros, alleging that Amoros handled their 
buttocks and genitals during closed-door casting interviews for the syndicated 
talk show. Screen Actors Guild members Raul Reformina, Richard Yett and Hieu 
Dang say they had responded to a casting call seeking "men with small butts" 
for a skit titled "Buttmaster," spoofing the Thighmaster exercise device. 
Paramount and "The Arsenio Hall Show" said Thursday that they conducted an 
investigation after hearing of the charge and that "Mr. Amoros has been 
terminated."

 * Top 10 Reasons to Do Radio: CBS Radio plans to syndicate David Letterman's 
"Top 10 List" to radio stations. The three-minute production, set to premiere 
April 1, will feature Letterman reading his list from the previous night's 
show. Although specific stations carrying the list have not yet been announced, 
it will be offered first to CBS-owned and affiliated stations, and KCBS-FM 
(93.1) expects to run the feature locally. QUICK TAKES

 A spokeswoman for Frank Sinatra said Thursday that the 78-year-old singer is 
in good health and "looking forward to going out on the road again." Sinatra, 
who collapsed Sunday during a concert in Virginia, is scheduled to resume his 
tour March 24 in Tulsa, Okla. . . . Fox TV has moved back the airdate for 
"Hostage for a Day," the directorial debut of the late John Candy, to April 25. 
The move makes room for the premiere of the two-hour TV movie "Honor Thy Father 
and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez Murders," on April 18. CBS, 
meanwhile, plans to air its four-hour miniseries "The Menendez Murders" during 
the May sweeps. . . . Los Angeles video director Kevin Kerslake has sued rock 
group Nirvana and lead singer Kurt Cobain for copyright infringement, claiming 
that the band stole his ideas for its "Heart Shaped Box" video, then went on to 
shoot it with another director. Kerslake previously directed four clips for 
Nirvana, including "Come as You Are." . . . Former KFI talk-show host Tom 
Leykis will return to Los Angeles this spring as host of a new syndicated talk 
show for Westwood One Inc. It has not yet been determined if his show will be 
heard on a Los Angeles station.

 * Quotable: "Last year, there was a big stink about actors making political 
statements. Then they turn around and ask me to host. They don't know what 
they've done." -- Whoopi Goldberg on Tuesday's "One on One With Magic Johnson," 
talking about her job as host of this year's Oscar show, which airs March 21 on 
ABC. SHAUNA SNOW

POP MUSIC REVIEW; NINE INCH NAILS HIT IT WITH THE MOSHERS

 Nine Inch Nails' new album may be titled "The Downward Spiral," but things 
seem anything but bleak for the industrial-rock band, which performed its first 
live set in 2 1/2 years on Wednesday to an adoring crowd of moshers, 
goth-rockers and celebrities at the Helter Skelter club in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 When word got out that Trent Reznor -- the wizard behind Nails' powerful, 
poetic music -- would be performing the unannounced show, fans began lining up 
in mid-afternoon outside the aptly named club.(Reznor recorded the new album at 
the Benedict Canyon home where actress Sharon Tate and others were slain by 
followers of Charles Manson in 1969.) 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 black-clad hopefuls didn't make it in to the 400-capacity room, and 
they really did miss out as Reznor and his four musicians seemed anything but 
out of practice during their intense and loud, hour-plus set of old and new NIN 
music. At times, the band even appeared to exercise a bit of restraint, 
seemingly to keep the intense mosh pit from swallowing up the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Spiral" was just released Tuesday, most of the audience -- which 
included guitarist Steve Vai, MTV veejay Kennedy and record producer Rick Rubin 
-- appeared to know the lyrics to the five new songs Reznor performed. 
</P>
<P>
 During one memorable chant from the new "Heresy" -- "Your God is dead/And no 
one cares/If there is a hell/ I'll see you there" -- it was clear that most of 
the worshipful crowd had found a new rock 'n' roll deity in the compelling 
Reznor. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was a warm-up for an international NIN tour that kicks off the first 
week of April in Australia before heading to L.A. later that month. HEIDI

MOVIE REVIEW; 'LIGHTNING JACK': ON THE RUN WITH OUTLAWS IN THE OLD WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What can you say about the very dull "Lightning Jack"? "Unforgiven" it's not. 
"Cat Ballou" it's not either. It's not even "Quigley Down Under." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hogan plays Jack, a -- har, har -- nearsighted Aussie gunslinger in the 
Old West. He's on the run from the law in Junction City for a botched robbery. 
Ben (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a mute, is his all-too-obliging hostage who becomes his 
all-too-obliging accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
 The pairing does not begin auspiciously, as Ben prepares to suck rattlesnake 
venom from Jack's rear quarters. This could be the first "Beavis and Butt-head" 
Western, except it's not as witty. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called resurgence of the movie Western in recent years is mostly studio 
hype -- for every "Unforgiven" there's a "Posse." But "Lightning Jack" doesn't 
even attempt to put a spin on the genre. It's just dawdles along in amiable 
imbecility. It looks as if it were made because everyone involved felt like 
kicking up some dust and spitting tobacco juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan, looking trim and leathery -- like a cross between Johnny Carson and a 
shank of beef jerky -- doesn't exactly stretch his modest skills. Gooding 
overdoes the mute business with so much mugging that he makes Holly Hunter's 
overactive overacting in "The Piano" seem restrained by comparison. (The 
problem with mute characters in movies is that their muteness invariably leads 
to miming, and miming rightly provokes bloodlust. When Dustin Hoffman punched 
out that mime in "Tootsie," the audience's cheers rocked the rafters.) 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly D'Angelo and Pat Hingle put in some old-pro cameo appearances, just 
long enough to make you moon for some real acting. 
</P>
<P>
 At least there won't be a sequel. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; 'TESS' ENDS UP IN GUARDED CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike the often troublesome academic subject, nothing is more welcome or 
elusive in pictures than Hollywood's version of chemistry, the sparks two 
actors set off when they mix on screen. Sometimes, too, the most unlikely 
combinations prove effective, and so it is with Shirley MacLaine and Nicolas 
Cage in "Guarding Tess." 
</P>
<P>
 Though they've never acted together and most likely never even met before this 
pairing, these disparate performers find common ground in this delicately funny 
chamber comedy about the war of nerves that develops between a formidable 
former First Lady and the dissatisfied Secret Service agent assigned to protect 
and serve. 
</P>
<P>
 But aside from demonstrating how far a pleasing acting mixture can take you, 
"Guarding Tess" also shows its limitations. Though set up beautifully, "Tess" 
has difficulty delivering on its promise, taking an unexpected and 
unsatisfactory turn that undercuts rather than emphasizes all the good things 
that have come before. 
</P>
<P>
 And as good as its performances are, "Tess" also benefits from the 
unmistakable stamp of Hugh Wilson, whose playful sensibility created 
television's "WKRP in Cincinnati," "Frank's Place" and "The Famous Teddy Z." In 
addition to co-writing (with Peter Torokvei) and directing, Wilson plays a 
crucial voice-only role that helps set "Tess' " comic tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Tess Carlisle (MacLaine) is the widow of a President, a take-no-guff figure 
("Don't Mess With Tess" reads a Time magazine cover) who is much beloved by the 
great American public. But guarding this termagant, Doug Chesnic (Cage) tells 
his boss, is without doubt "the worst assignment there is in the Secret 
Service." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug feels free to express these thoughts because after three years of living 
in deeply tedious Ohio and being the agent in charge of Tess' detail, he thinks 
he's on the verge of another, more cutting-edge assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes a phone call from the current President, a Carlisle protege (done 
in great unctuous/enthusiastic style by Wilson himself) who says that Tess has 
requested another tour for her favorite agent and that he as Chief Executive 
would consider it a personal favor if Doug agreed to return. 
</P>
<P>
 For it turns out that this tough, formidable woman enjoys nothing better than 
engaging in wars of words with the strictly-by-the-book Agent Chesnic. Their 
always polite, always deadly verbal duels are invariably engaging, and though 
the President of course exaggerates when he suggests "maybe you two have some 
kind of sicko thing going on," their acerbic, ironic battles inevitably binds 
them into a "Driving Miss Daisy"-type relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his work is problematic at times, there is perhaps no actor of his 
generation who does better in ridiculous situations ("Moonstruck," "Honeymoon 
in Vegas") than Cage. Neither he nor the equally adept MacLaine forces or 
flaunts their characterizations; rather they underplay their parts as much as 
the situation allows, and though neither breaks any new ground, they succeed in 
bringing "Tess' " light-on-its-feet humor to life. 
</P>
<P>
 After facing off in a number of whimsical situations (a mid-winter golf game, 
comic trips to the opera and the supermarket), Tess and Doug begin to bring 
other colors to their interaction, and for a brief while it seems as if this 
film will be able to gracefully segue to a more serious emotional level. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "Guarding Tess" takes a sharp hairpin turn, as if Miss Daisy's house 
were suddenly burned to the ground by a vengeful pack of Klansmen, a plot twist 
out of character with what's gone before and one that seems to have come from a 
totally different movie. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's understandable that it was thought that "Tess" needed something 
more, that it couldn't go on merely being clever and fragile, this solution 
goes too far in the opposite direction. It turns "Guarding Tess" into a movie 
Tess herself would have seen through, and that is not a good sign.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; AT IL PASTAIO, THE WAIT'S WORTH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before capellini alla checca was a universal phenomenon, you could go to 
Celestino in Beverly Hills and eat a bowl of angel hair pasta topped, of 
course, with uncooked chopped fresh tomatoes, basil and garlic ignited with an 
excellent olive oil. It was a dish of stunning and characteristic simplicity. 
At a time when many of the city's chefs were in a frenzy of eclectic invention, 
Celestino Drago kept his food uncomplicated. As a result, I remember certain 
dishes with startling clarity: a bright goat cheese salad, a puckery raw 
artichoke salad, a squid ink seafood risotto that looked like gravel and tasted 
like heaven.  
</P>
<P>
 Celestino Drago eventually left Celestino to open the well-regarded Drago in 
Santa Monica. Now, he's back in Beverly Hills too, with a small, 
quintessentially simple pasta place: Il Pastaio. In the old Kaktus space at 
Canon and Brighton, the room is long and narrow, with white walls, lovely 
wood-sashed windows, a long bar and pasta-making area. The early dinner rush is 
largely older folk; gradually, the clientele grows hipper and younger, or seems 
to -- in Beverly Hills, it's impossible to tell for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices are reasonable. The service, as ever, is gracious, intelligent, 
high-humored, swift. The food, in general, is terrific. Il Pastaio's major 
drawback, however, arises from exactly these virtues: For a restaurant of this 
price range and quality, Il Pastaio is too small. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So there's almost always a wait. I've gone early, I've gone late and the wait 
is 20 to 30 minutes for a table for two, up to an hour for one of the larger 
tables. We cram against the bar, scatter on the sidewalk, take walks through 
the neighborhood. The wait is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Il Pastaio's menu is distinguished by its lack of secondi -- entrees. It's all 
starters, pastas and risottos. Within each of these categories, however, 
there's admirable range and a few choice rarities. 
</P>
<P>
 A juicy, bright seafood salad appetizer is punctuated with crunchy cornichons 
-- a day at the beach on a plate. The goat cheese salad with strips of grilled 
peppers and baby eggplant sparkles with excellent olive oil. Sweet grilled 
shrimp sets off the Sicilian caponata, a dark, intense eggplant concoction 
bristling with mysterious textures that, under scrutiny, reveal themselves to 
be crisp fried capers, lusciously plumped stewed grapes and pine nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Farro , or spelt, is an ancient variety of wheat with a lovely nubbly texture 
not unlike round, firm rice that, traditionally, was the last meal Roman 
soldiers ate before going to war. Il Pastaio has an appropriately inspiring 
bean and farro soup which, however, is not a recommended appetizer to risotto 
-- the two share the same heft and gratifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four carpaccios, the cool swordfish with shaved fennel and blood 
oranges is the most sensuous and swoony. Marinated venison, with its bosky 
after-taste, is smartly matched with arugula and a musky dried ricotta cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Black and white trenette , a thin, squared egg noodle, sits in a light, 
bracing, wine-scented broth with fresh clams and a small, aromatic dose of 
shredded arugula. Half moon ravioli stuffed with sweet lobster and zucchini 
loll in a luxuriantly creamy lobster reduction. I was disappointed to find that 
the tomatoes in the capellini alla checca , as in most versions available in 
this town, were thoroughly heated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be missed are the outrageously pleasurable garganelli : Chewy and 
porous, these curls of wheat pasta are shaped like lips or not-quite-closed 
tubes and hold in their folds a lusty amatriciana sauce (pureed tomato, 
pancetta, pecorino, onion). 
</P>
<P>
 I was delighted, of course, to find the classic granite-gray squid ink 
risotto: Lighter than many risottos, faintly and pleasingly oceanic in flavor, 
it is studded with fat and sweet pink shrimp, small cylindrical scallops and 
chewy snarls of calamari. Richer, creamier, the risotto with mascarpone cheese 
and wild mushrooms is, in contrast, a cozy snooze under a goose down comforter. 
A subtle grass-green risotto with peas and a custardy spinach puree could have 
been stirred a minute longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, Drago's fluffy definitive tiramisu is available, because other 
desserts are not very good. Ordering ricotta cheesecake, I expected Drago's 
light, lemony cake with pine nuts and raisins; I received a dull, overly 
perfumed wedge of pie. 
</P>
<P>
 * Il Pastaio, 400 N. Canon Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 205-5444. Lunch and 
dinner Monday through Saturday. Full bar. Valet parking. Major credit cards 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $30-$52.

OPERA REVIEW; 'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR': DULL AND DUTIFUL DONIZETTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Friday, Opera Pacific swept caution to the Santa Ana winds and ventured 
some lofty, heavyweight Wagner. Honorably. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, the company reverted to dull and dutiful, hand-me-down, 
bargain-basement Donizetti -- via "Lucia di Lammermoor." Business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing went grotesquely wrong with the mellifluous old masterpiece. But, 
apart from some flashes of brilliance from the beleaguered leading lady, not 
much went memorably right, either. 
</P>
<P>
 This, essentially, was a noisy festival of belt-canto. And that isn't a 
typographical error. 
</P>
<P>
 Grace? Elegance? Finesse? Expressive sensitivity? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance at the Orange County Performing Arts Center turned out to be a 
model demonstration of ancient, not-so-grand art of instant opera. You know -- 
borrow some generic sets, hire a rising star and surround her with an 
inexpensive collection of would-be's, get a traffic cop to arrange the cast in 
picturesque formations, and find a conductor who can stir the lumpy musical 
broth unobtrusively, then meet the singers at the cadence. 
</P>
<P>
 Presto, questo. . . . It's easy. It's depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news on this occasion was monopolized by Ruth Ann Swenson in the 
title role. Without the support of a stylish conductor and an imaginative stage 
director, she couldn't do much to justify a program blurb that invoked 
comparisons with such disparate paragons as Pons, Callas, Sutherland and Sills. 
Even when seemingly left to her own bland devices, however, she confirmed her 
extraordinary potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice is an astonishingly big and strong lyric-soprano equipped with a 
brilliant top extension. She uses it with reasonable agility and, apart from 
stratospheric climaxes that tend to go sharp, with remarkable accuracy. She 
looks attractively plucky -- actually like a plump and pleasing Tonya Harding 
-- and she strikes apt poses. 
</P>
<P>
 She managed some breathtaking flights of fancy fiorature in a quaintly 
bloodied Mad Scene. When the spirit moved her, she floated some ravishing 
pianissimo phrases, and seldom stopped for anything so prosaic as the intake of 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she sounded rather rough at the outset, and she did little to shade the 
text or define the heroine's character beyond the customary platitudes. Looking 
basically healthy and only mildly perplexed, she hardly made her ultimate 
descent into melodic madness seem inevitable, much less tragic. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps next time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Hernandez partnered her as a small-scaled, sweet-toned, moderately 
ardent Edgardo afflicted with occasional pitch and focus problems of his own. 
Mark Rucker's burly baritone defined a mean Enrico who would rather roar than 
soar. Under the circumstances, one could hardly lament the omission of the 
Wolf-Crag duet. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen West was suitably dignified, his basso unsuitably loud and not 
terribly steady as Raimondo, a.k.a. Bide-the-bent. The lesser figures seldom 
rose above a mediocre opera-workshop level. 
</P>
<P>
 The ever-enthusiastic chorus, trained by Henri Venanzi, registered energy, 
literally to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Flint conducted with brisk and brusque efficiency. The modest orchestra 
responded with modest generalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman Terleckyj oversaw the fussy entrances and exits within Henry Bardon's 
shabby, quasi-literal, old-fashioned canvas scenery, designed for Dallas 22 
years ago. The warehouse sets were attributed to Peter J. Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 At least no one decided to subject the elementally Romantic drama to trendy 
updating. The stage was not cluttered with expressionistic coffins as at the 
Met, and the central image was not a petrified dung heap as at the Music 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Small favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * Even though "Lucia" is one of the world's most popular and most tuneful 
operas, one saw plenty of empty seats in the house. And "Die Walkure" isn't 
selling very well, either. So much for operatic appetites in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interesting attempt to boost box-office action, the management has 
decided to offer an automatic upgrade to anyone who buys tickets at the center 
on Saturday between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Example: A $40 purchase for the rear of 
Tier 2 will actually get the opera-goer a seat in the front, worth $65. 
</P>
<P>
 * The non-capacity opening-night audience was enthusiastic. In the case of the 
crass whistler who pierced ear-drums at every Luftpause, it was too 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the second time in the history of the hall, needy travelers were sold 
coffee during intermissions in the alfresco foyer. The gods can be merciful. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lucia di Lammermoor" presented by Opera Pacific at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, Costa Mesa. Remaining performances tonight, Thursday 
and March 19 at 8 p.m., March 13 at 2 p.m. Tickets ranging from $15 to $75 (see 
incidental intelligence above), at center box office and agencies. Rush seats 
for students and seniors sold at $15 one hour before curtain, if available. 
Additional performance March 23 at the McCallum Theatre in Palm Desert.

MUSIC REVIEW; AN INCONSISTENT OUTING FROM CECILIA BARTOLI AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A second encounter with a much-heralded artist can sometimes produce 
disenchantment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the return by the spectacularly gifted and remarkably 
accomplished Italian mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli to Ambassador Auditorium. As 
heard there Wednesday night, Bartoli, 27, remains one of the few potential 
superstars in a firmament depressingly unilluminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, those of us who waxed poetic upon Bartoli's local debut recital in 
February, 1992, now have reasons to reconsider, two years later, her specific 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 The attractive young artist -- her ebullience, good nature and apparently 
clear health keep her in such a category -- seems to be developing in 
controversial ways. The pure and natural timbre of her easily produced voice is 
now taking on other colorations: a thickness and darkening in the bottom third 
of the range, for example, which might in time become a hoot. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, her artistry, so direct and unaffected on first encounter, 
seems to have been transformed by her success. Vocal mannerisms -- a slight tic 
here, a few nearly inaudible notes there -- creep into her arsenal of effects. 
And her new habits of raising her hands above her head, Rocky Balboa-style, and 
of applauding her audience even as they barely begin to applaud her, distract 
from the characteristic sincerity of her communicativeness. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program sung entirely in Italian and Latin, and assisted conscientiously 
at the piano by conductor Gyorgy Fischer, Bartoli made beautiful sounds and 
gave touching performances of songs and arias by Beethoven, Schubert, Mozart, 
Rossini and Bellini. Yet her singing on Wednesday lacked a great deal of 
variety, proved in-and-out in terms of style and linearity and missed by far 
that strong sense of definition one found at her earlier visit. 
</P>
<P>
 A certain discipline and self-criticism would seem to be the Roman singer's 
missing attributes at this juncture; of course, their lack must affect every 
aspect of her work. 
</P>
<P>
 What Bartoli does best is sing the notes -- from very low to very high, on 
this occasion up to C-sharp above the staff -- easily, and with an enthusiasm 
and an abandon that listeners may find irresistible. She charms through her 
apparent spontaneity and instinctive musicality. 
</P>
<P>
 In a successful traversal of many difficulties, albeit with many technical 
inconsistencies, Bartoli produced engaging victories over Mozart's motet, 
"Exsultate, jubilate," and over Bellini's aria, "O rendetemi . . . Qui la voce 
. . . Vien diletto," from the Malibran version of "I Puritani." 
</P>
<P>
 Then she sang four encores: Rossini's "Canzonetta Spagnuola," Paisiello's "Nel 
cor piu non mi sento," "Voi che sapete" from Mozart's "Nozze di Figaro" and the 
Seguedille from "Carmen," by Bizet.

JAZZ NOTES: ENTERING DEWEY REDMAN'S DIVERSE MUSICAL WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dewey Redman. 
</P>
<P>
 The name sounds familiar but most jazz fans would associate the name with 
Joshua Redman, the latest Wunderkind on the jazz scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But long before his son arrived in a major way on the music scene, Dewey 
Redman had established himself as a highly regarded tenor saxophonist, 
performing and recording with Ornette Coleman, Keith Jarrett, Pat Metheny and 
Charlie Haden's Liberation Orchestra, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these associations and plenty of critical acclaim, Redman has never 
managed to find a secure niche in the jazz mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm strugglin', as I have been doing for the 26 years I've been in New York," 
says the 62-year-old Fort Worth native, who makes his Los Angeles debut as a 
leader Tuesday at Catalina Bar & Grill. "I've starved, and I've done well. If I 
lived in Europe, I could get my choice of gigs. There, I get a completely 
different feeling. I'm treated like an artist. But I can't seem to leave here. 
New York's a fascinating place, the musical capital of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps one reason that relative fame and fortune have eluded Redman is that 
he inhabits a diverse musical world. The man with the bold tone and expressive 
ideas primarily embraces the freer aspects of jazz's avant-garde, but also 
admits an interest in be-bop, blues and other forms, giving him a 
multi-directional stance that may make it difficult for listeners to grasp. 
However, Redman isn't concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play a little bit of everything, and I'm proud of that. But when you wear 
three or four hats, it's hard to get those styles to always come out. Maybe 
once or twice a year they do," he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he hasn't made an album in two years, there's a lot of Redman available 
on recordings. He can be heard on albums such as Coleman's "New York Is Now" 
and "Love Call" (Blue Note); Jarrett's "Silence" (Impulse!) and "Foundations" 
(Rhino/Atlantic); Haden's "Dreamkeeper" (Blue Note); Old and New Dreams' "A 
Tribute to Blackwell" (Black Saint); and his own "Living on the Edge" (Black 
Saint) and "Choices" (Enja), which features his son Joshua. 
</P>
<P>
 "New York Is Now," recorded with Coleman, drummer Elvin Jones and bassist 
Jimmy Garrison, stands out in Redman's memory. He moved to New York in 1969 and 
made the album with his high school classmate Coleman two years later. "I 
walked into the studio and I was shaking," Redman says. "I felt I didn't have 
any business there. Elvin and Jimmy had played with Coltrane and Ornette had 
been in New York since 1959. But Jimmy took me into a corner and told me, 'You 
can play. Just don't try to do anything you haven't done.' I made it through, 
and I like the album. It was a privilege for me to play with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he feels about his son's rapid rise in jazz, Redman is direct. "I'm 
not jealous, maybe a little envious, but very proud," he says. "He scares me to 
death, he plays so maturely. He's 25, plays like he's 55. He's going to get all 
the stuff I never got, including the recognition. But he's not letting it go to 
his head. He's still humble." 
</P>
<P>
 Redman's quartet -- with Kenny Kirkland (piano), Cameron Brown (bass) and 
Ralph Penland (drums) -- plays Tuesday through March 20, 9 and 11 p.m., at 
Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood. $12-$15 cover, two 
drink minimum. Information: (213) 466-2210. 
</P>
<P>
 Good Cause: Lyrical singer Kevyn Lettau, whose latest JVC release is "Another 
Season," performs Wednesday at the Troubadour, in a benefit for Children of the 
Night. The organization provides food, shelter and counseling for runaway 
children ages 11 through 17.

THEATER BEAT: THE ODYSSEY'S AFFECTIONATE 'MADWOMAN OF CHAILLOT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's always encouraging when a theater takes on the challenge of a classic 
like Jean Giraudoux's "The Madwoman of Chaillot." It's a real kick, though, 
when they pull it off -- as in Odyssey artistic director Ron Sossi's staging of 
the 1944 satire. 
</P>
<P>
 Written in the year of the liberation of France and the playwright's death, 
Giraudoux's fable centers on nutsy Countess Aurelia (Sheree North) and her 
fellow Frenchmen, from a klatch of cafe bohemians to a cabal of crazy ladies. 
Aurelia enlists her cronies in a plan to thwart some amorphous nasties whose 
business dealings are threatening to blot out all the good in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 The eloquent play, in Maurice Valency's fluid adaptation, holds up 
surprisingly well -- thanks to Giraudoux's rare ability to strike a note that's 
wistful and humanistic without being naive, biting but not bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 The triumph of good over evil may be broadly and even sentimentally drawn, but 
it is never without equivocation. Compassion and reason, after all, exist only 
in the Countess' alternate universe. And the happy resolution is as precarious 
as the madwoman's mental state. 
</P>
<P>
 Giraudoux, unlike so many contemporary writers, was concerned not with man as 
a bundle of psychology, but as a moral agent. That allows him to broach the 
bigger questions and wrestle with people's contradictory impulses -- in other 
words, to employ the medium of theater as more than mere diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sossi has staged the play with great understanding, affection and, in Act 2, 
frequently sumptuous theatricality. North relishes the diva role without 
overplaying her hand. She's surrounded by a large cast whose members have the 
grace and skill to play as an ensemble, with particularly memorable 
performances from Zitto Kazann and Ron House. And Audrey Eisner and Lindsay 
Stewart's costumes strike just the right balance between familiarity and 
eccentricity. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Madwoman of Chaillot," Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, 2055 S. Sepulveda 
Blvd., West L.A. Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. except March 13, 
20 2 p.m. only. Ends April 17. $21.50-$17.50. (310) 477-2055. Running time: 2 
hours, 45 minutes. An Inconsistent 'Time' at Lost Studio 
</P>
<P>
 The unrelenting scuzziness of Mick Collins' "Wino Time" at the Lost Studio is 
both its asset and its liability. While the play's noir aesthetic is 
unflinching, it doesn't know when enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the provocative realm of private care facilities for substance abusers, 
"Wino Time" is a slice of stylized sociology that slouches toward, but never 
quite reaches, a higher plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-hero/victim Mario (the incisive Joseph Goodrich) is drowning in the limbo 
that is Claire's Care House, surrounded by losers who are worse off than he and 
recalcitrant caretakers Claire (Cinda Jackson) and Bill (Mickey Swenson). 
Goodrich and Collins, who also directs, use Mario to convey both manic 
claustrophobia and the inertia of despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, once you get beyond this central character, both the script and 
the acting are noticeably inconsistent. There are some gritty, realistic scenes 
written in the play's anti-literary argot. But there are also gratuitous riffs 
of scatological and pornographic excess that read like the rantings of a kid 
who's just discovered a new dirty word. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the company divides between staunch naturalists (Goodrich, Jackson, 
Jay Arlen Jones) and those who reduce acting to a bunch of twitchy mannerisms 
(Jeff Daniel Phillips, Soumaya Akaaboune). There is also one utterly ridiculous 
and extraneous character -- a waif-like urchin (Akaaboune) whom Mario keeps 
stashed behind his couch -- that undermines an otherwise fairly credible play. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wino Time," Lost Studio, 130 S. La Brea, Hollywood. Friday-Saturday, 8 p.m. 
Ends Saturday. (213) 933-6944. Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes. An Amateurish 
'Other Weapon' 
</P>
<P>
 You can't fault New York-based writer-director Robbie McCauley's intentions in 
"The Other Weapon" (various locations). Her decision to come here to create, in 
collaboration with 10 L.A. artists, a piece about the Black Panthers was 
promising. Too bad the result is more didactic than dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in the documentary theater mode mainstreamed by Emily Mann and others 
and recently popularized by Anna Deavere Smith -- in which actors portray 
actual members of a community by using snippets of their transcribed interviews 
as dialogue -- McCauley and her cohorts offer up a collage of recollections, 
anecdotes and narratives about, but not limited to, the activities of the L.A. 
Black Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, the show is pitched at the level of a production meant to tour 
junior high schools. The content is reductive, the tone arch and the 
presentation amateurish. 
</P>
<P>
 The only repeated line is a tip-off: "It's still cold and it's still mean. And 
color is still everything." Such a parochial view would not have set well with 
the Marxist/Guevaraist Panthers, let alone today's emerging African American 
artists and thinkers who can look to the likes of philosopher Cornel West for 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 There are impressive performers among the uneven ensemble, including the 
Obie-winning McCauley and L.A.'s own Denise Uyehara. But they're not at their 
best here. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Other Weapon," various locations: Today-Saturday, 8 p.m., UCLA Little 
Theater, Macgowan Hall, Westwood; March 18-19, 8 p.m., Southland Cultural 
Center, 226 S. Market St., Inglewood; March 25-26, 8 p.m., Hollywood Moguls 
Theatre, 1650 N. Hudson Ave., Hollywood. Ends March 26. $10. (213) 660-TKTS. 
Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes. 'Undoing' Showcases Skills of Susan Burke 
</P>
<P>
 As a vehicle to show off the skills of actress Susan Burke, William 
Mastrosimone's "The Undoing" at the Cast works, at least in Act 1. As anything 
else, it's just a contrived bit of bathos. 
</P>
<P>
 Mastrosimone has a penchant for implausible scenarios that pit two unlikely 
adversaries against one another. In this version of his favorite setup, an 
alcoholic widow named Lorraine (Burke) is working in her East Coast chicken 
slaughter shop when a stranger (hyper-tense Dean Coleman) appears at her door. 
</P>
<P>
 After the requisite seduction and efforts to dry out Lorraine, it's revealed 
that the stranger is the ex-drunk who mowed down Lorraine's husband. Of course, 
by the time that's actually said, we've been waiting for it for more than an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Undoing," Cast-at-the-Circle Theatre, 802 N. El Centro Ave., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends April 10. $15. (213) 462-0265. Running time: 1 
hour, 45 minutes. 'Chris Hogan Show' Lacks Structure 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe "The Chris Hogan Show" at the Coast Playhouse has value as a forum for 
its two young performers to develop their stage skills. Let's hope so. Because 
it doesn't fly as theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The show -- show case , actually -- consists of two dudes in T-shirts, alone 
onstage with a couple of chairs and their sundry two-character improvs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan has a modicum of affable charm. And his sloppy sidekick John Lehr 
provides someone for the slackers in the house to identify with. But whatever 
talents these two may have would be better served by a more structured vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Chris Hogan Show," Coast Playhouse, 8325 Santa Monica Blvd., West 
Hollywood, Mondays-Tuesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Tuesday. $10. (213) 243-7316. Running 
time: 1 hour, 20 minutes.

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; HERE'S WHERE THE HED GOES

 "Kalifornia," with Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, may have played to near-empty 
theaters, but rental audiences sure love it. It climbed two more notches to No. 
6, out-performing some much more heralded, higher-grossing films."The Man 
Without a Face," is No. 7 after two weeks. Though Mel Gibson isn't playing the 
usual macho hunk, the film, which he also directed, is still luring renters. 
But this sentimental drama probably won't have the staying power of Gibson's 
action fare. Kim Basinger lost a multi-million suit for allegedly backing out 
of an agreement to star in the sexy "Boxing Helena"--dubbed "Bombing Helena" in 
movie circles because of its puny box-office numbers. Still, the notoriety may 
translate into home-video success, even though Basinger would have been a 
stronger rental attraction than Sherilyn Fenn. "Helena" debuted at No. 25 and 
should at least crack the Top 20. . 
</P>
<P>
 * Most adults would no doubt cringe at "Son-in-Law," which gets laughs as 
urbanite Pauly Shore bumbles through a visit down on the farm. But pre-teens 
and teens are drawn to this kind of low-brow silliness. It did fine at the 
box-office--$36.4 million--and is expected to be a rental hit too. After 
debuting at No. 19 this week, it should shoot into the Top 10 in the next week 
or two. 03,24,06,08 Rank Weeks Last on the Week Chart 1."In the Line of Fire" 1

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: TWO RELEASES A WELCOME SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Twenty-One Good Reasons: The Paul Carrack Collection" and Marty Robbins' 
"Lost and Found" are albums that arrive as surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The first collection catches you off guard because you don't really expect a 
Carrack retrospective. The Englishman is a gifted singer and keyboardist, but 
since he's one of the most anonymous hitmakers of the modern pop era, you could 
easily imagine his being overlooked when executives at Chrysalis Records were 
putting together their list of 1994 retrospectives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robbins CD is a surprise because few outside of Columbia Records knew that 
the tracks even existed. The album is filled with "lost" recordings that never 
appeared on the late country singer's numerous albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Both packages, however, are welcome, if highly uneven, works. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrack has only had one Top 10 U.S. hit under his own name: 1987's "Don't 
Shed a Tear." As a member of various groups, however, he sang lead on such 
high-profile singles as Ace's "How Long" in 1975, Squeeze's "Tempted" in 1981 
and Mike + the Mechanics' "Silent Running (On Dangerous Ground)" in 1985 and 
"The Living Years" in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to making the album work was the decision to go beyond Carrack's solo 
recordings to his work with the other groups. What he often gains in those 
settings is better songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrack's own compositions, such as "You're All That I Need" from the Ace days 
and "A Little Unkind" from the solo years, tend to be rather colorless. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a winningly soulful edge to his singing that shines on such songs 
as Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook's "Tempted" and even Mike Rutherford and 
B.A. Robertson's "The Living Years." 
</P>
<P>
 In the liner notes, Carrack reflects on each of the recordings. About "The 
Living Years," his biggest hit: "It related to my own life in that my father 
passed away when I was 11. . . . I am amazed at the number of people who stop 
me on the street and tell me how the song has moved them or actually made them 
call up a loved one." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, who had hits in styles ranging from pure honky-tonk and rockabilly to 
gunfighter narratives to ballads, had a remarkable career that included more 
than 75 Top 40 country hits and more than a dozen Top 40 pop hits before his 
death in 1982. They ranged from 1959's "El Paso" to 1970's "My Woman, My Woman, 
My Wife." 
</P>
<P>
 While the packaging is skimpy (there's no information on when the tracks were 
recorded, except to say they were all done between 1972 and 1982) and the song 
quality is weak, Robbins' voice remains endearing. As the album's most notable 
tracks -- "The Beginning of Goodbye" and "Twenty Dollar Jim" -- remind us, 
Robbins was one of the warmest of all post-1940s country interpreters.

HOME TECH / LASER BIN: THE MUMMY'S REVENGE: A MONSTROUS COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can get a head start on dear old Mummy's Day with MCA/Universal's latest 
dip into its horror-film vaults: "The Mummy Collection" ($100). The four-film 
set unearths the 1940s' "Mummy" series that proved to be among the studio's 
favorite monsters: "The Mummy's Hand," "The Mummy's Ghost," "The Mummy's Tomb" 
and "The Mummy's Curse." 
</P>
<P>
 The films were all low-budget quickies made between 1940 and 1944. (The 
original 1932 "The Mummy," starring Boris Karloff, which set the standard, is 
also available separately on laser from MCA, at $35.) 
</P>
<P>
 The new three-disc collection comes complete with a six-page full-color 
brochure that includes informative liner notes on each film, plus chapter 
stops. Supplemental material -- theatrical trailers and production stills -- 
come at the end of Sides 3 and 6, each covering the two films preceding them. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Mummy" films unwrap sequentially, beginning with the best of the four, 
"The Mummy's Hand," from 1940, shot in two weeks for $80,000, directed by 
Christy Cabanne and written by Griffin Jay and Maxwell Shane. The film stars 
cowboy Tom Tyler and features George Zucco as the High Priest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mummy's Tomb" (1942) introduces Lon Chaney Jr. as the monster and 
co-stars Elyse Knox. "The Scarlet Pimpernel's" Harold Young directs. Chaney 
reports that he "didn't like the part at all. There wasn't anything you could 
do with the Mummy. You just got into the makeup and bandages and walked around 
dragging your leg." Looking at these films, you have to agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Good contract player that he was, Chaney dragged his leg around again in 
1944's "The Mummy's Ghost." Arguably the least of the series, it features an 
over-the-top John Carradine, which director Reginald LeBorg says he allowed 
because "Carradine's voice was sonorous and excellent, much better than the 
average actor's, so I let him go on. In a picture like that, you can be a 
little hammy." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mummy's Curse," also released in 1944, was the last chapter in the 
series, once more featuring Chaney, this time with Virginia Christine (later 
finding TV fame as Folger's Mrs. Olson). The setting of this one is, of all 
places, the Louisiana bayou. The novelty of the location helps a little. 
</P>
<P>
 If all this whets your appetite for more monster movie lore, check out MCA's 
new release of "Man of a Thousand Faces" (letterboxed, $40). The 1957 film 
stars no less than James Cagney as Lon Chaney Sr., the silent film actor who 
set the standards for monster portrayals. Directed by Joseph Pevney, and 
featuring Jane Greer, Dorothy Malone, Jack Albertson and Marjorie Rambeau, this 
is one of those rare birds: a well-done biopic that does justice to its famous 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other recent releases reveal, once more, that laser technology can 
sometimes enhance watching films at home but can't improve bad stories: 
"Demolition Man" (Warner Home Video, letterboxed, $35), starring Sylvester 
Stallone and Wesley Snipes, comes with full-bodied wrap-around sound that 
magnifies the mayhem, and surprisingly wide banding for a film made in the 
1990s; "The Man Without a Face" (Warner, letterboxed, $35), the quietly 
affecting 1993 film starring and directed by Mel Gibson as a disfigured loner 
befriended by a lonely young boy, transfers well with relatively narrow 
banding, but even state-of-the-art laser technology can't help 1993's "For Love 
or Money" (MCA, letterboxed, $35), the absurd Michael J. Fox romantic comedy in 
which he plays a concierge with "dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Laserbits

<P>
 New Movies Just Out: "Manhattan Murder Mystery" (Columbia TriStar, $35); "Much 
Ado About Nothing" (Columbia TriStar, $35); "Striking Distance" (Columbia 
TriStar, letterboxed, $35); "Son-in-Law" (Hollywood, $40); "Hot Shots! Part 
Deux" (FoxVideo, $40); "Amongst Friends" (New Line, $40); "Fortress" (LIVE, 
$40); "So I Married an Axe Murderer" (Columbia TriStar, $35). 
</P>
<P>
 Old Movies Just Out: "My Favorite Year" (MGM/UA, 1982, $35), the classic 
comedy about early TV starring Peter O'Toole; "Bathing Beauty" (MGM/UA, 1944, 
$35), Esther Williams' first starring role; "Support Your Local Sheriff" 
(MGM/UA, 1969, $35) the hilarious Western parody featuring James Garner. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming: MCA/Universal will release "Judgment Night," starring Emilio 
Estevez, on Wednesday at $35; Warner's "The Fugitive," starring Harrison Ford, 
is due March 22 at $40; Al Pacino stars in "Carlito's Way," scheduled for April 
20 (MCA/Universal, $40); "Fatal Instinct," featuring Sherilyn Fenn and Sean 
Young in the genre parody, is due March 23 (MGM/UA, $35); Warner will issue "M 
Butterfly," with Jeremy Irons, on April 6 at $35.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; PLAY IT AGAIN, KENNY; ROGERS' TOO-FAMILIAR CERRITOS SHOW 
INCLUDED THE SAME SONGS, SAME BITS AND SAME ADORING AUDIENCE AS HIS LAST 
CONCERT AT THE VENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Maybe Kenny Rogers needs a new writer. Or at least some new shtick. And he 
definitely needs a replacement for the electric-blue jacket he's been wearing 
for far too long. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening night performance of Rogers' second annual five-night run at the 
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts on Wednesday was a near carbon copy of 
the show he brought to the same venue last February. It was a show that he 
probably could do in his sleep, and there were times when it appeared that was 
precisely what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more familiar bits -- offering to pay a seemingly disinterested 
audience member $10 for any hit he could recognize, introducing "Bo Diddley" 
with a story about a dream he had about appearing in Cerritos -- were done in 
nearly word-for-word repetitions of previous performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Did it matter to his audience? Not at all. They loved every minute, every 
song, every predictable gag. Even when Rogers is doing little more than working 
his casual way through the well-known catalogue of hits -- from "Lucille" to 
"Ruby" to "The Gambler" -- he is the kind of performer who generates undying, 
all-accepting love from his listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 His oldies, in fact, have achieved such memorable proportions that Rogers can 
hold his microphone up to the crowd when he reaches the chorus of, say, 
"Lucille" in complete confidence that they will know and will sing every line 
without any prompting. 
</P>
<P>
 With a six-movie deal for NBC-TV, TV music specials, various big-time business 
ventures and the publication of a new book of his photographs, Rogers clearly 
doesn't have a lot of time to devote to refurbishing his stage act. Still, one 
wonders why all the loyalty Rogers receives from his fans isn't rewarded with a 
bit more effort on his part. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his finer moments, briefly apparent in his versions of "Lady" and an 
unexpectedly subtle rendering of the standard "When I Fall in Love," Rogers 
revealed that he is still capable of setting aside all the prepackaged jokes, 
comments and asides, and singing with musical understanding, subtlety and 
warmth. A broader application of those qualities to his overall performance 
would have made for a far more appealing evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-rising country singer Sammy Kershaw opened the set. A throwback to the 
uncomplicated, honky-tonk twang of George Jones and Mel Street, Kershaw is an 
artist whose most attractive attribute is his willingness to put his heart on 
his sleeve with each note he sings. 
</P>
<P>
 He sang his monster hit "Cadillac Style," of course, and countered with the 
woe of "I Can't Reach Her Anymore" and the whimsy of "Queen of My Double Wide 
Trailer." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a congenial, good-times, straight-from-the-gut performance -- filled 
with the kind of sincere, unmanipulative passions that were too often lacking 
in Rogers' set. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kenny Rogers and Sammy Kershaw appear through Sunday at 8 p.m. at the 
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700 Center Court Drive, Cerritos. 
$48-$66. (800) 300-4345.

revealed that he is still capable of setting aside all the prepackaged jokes, 
comments and asides, and singing with musical understanding, subtlety and 
warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-rising, honky-tonk-style, country singer Sammy Kershaw opened the show 
with a congenial, straight-from-the-gut performance filled with the kind of 
sincere, unmanipulative passions that were too often lacking in Rogers' set.

THEATER REVIEW; TRADITION SLAYS YOUNG 'ROMEO AND JULIET'; THE ELIZABETHAN 
APPROACH AT GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE WOULD BE CHARMING, BUT THE STUDENTS ARE TOO 
INEXPERIENCED. 
</P>

<P>
 Everybody, apparently, is crazy about "Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993 alone, the Verona tragedy of star-crossed lovers had three major Los 
Angeles productions and several more community and college stagings. And it 
keeps coming: We're not even in spring, according to the groundhog, and Golden 
West College has Romeo and Juliet mixing it up at the campus Mainstage Theatre. 
(On another campus to the north -- UCLA -- playwright Edit Villareal has her 
own version, "The Language of Flowers," opening Friday.) 
</P>
<P>
 The major '93 productions demonstrated that there are countless ways to do "R 
and J," from director Michael Arabian's bold environmental approach on a studio 
back lot to the L.A. Women's Shakespeare Company's all-woman, Italianate 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there have been so many interpretations that the original one -- the 
Elizabethan approach -- adopted by director Charles Mitchell at Golden West 
looks charming by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Charming, that is, until his student cast starts playing Elizabethan. Then the 
magic and the passion fade fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West has amply proved that it is a few steps ahead of most college 
drama departments in the county. If it doesn't draw talent, it certainly 
appears to train it. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, most of the students are so unschooled in the ways of 
Shakespeare that this tragedy driven by impetuous emotions has all of the 
plodding grayness typical of a lame staging of one of the Bard's history plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Plodding, like Mitchell's '93 staging of "Dracula." In each, the mostly young 
actors look and sound as if they're mimicking the behavior of an era rather 
than understanding it and making it their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The detailed design elements for "Romeo," especially William Charles' fair 
simulation of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre for the set and Susan Thomas Babb's 
well-researched and lush costumes, can only do so much of the work of putting 
us in Shakespeare's time. 
</P>
<P>
 A big period element in this staging is Elizabethan bawdiness: the sort of 
business where the young cad says " 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh" 
and gestures below his belt. But it always appears practiced, and the energy 
that goes with bawdiness never develops. 
</P>
<P>
 The one actor with fuel to burn is Robin Spehar as a galloping, galvanic 
Mercutio, Romeo's dreaming pal with the gift of gab. But while Spehar appears 
to be putting on a clinic in comedy (and, in his death scene, how actors can 
resist cliches), the rest of his Veronese buddies stand watching him. This is a 
gang, of sorts, but Spehar is the only one who seems to know. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the energy scale, alas, are the lovers themselves -- 
Austin Lawrence's Romeo and Debbie Caceres-Gerber's Juliet. Lawrence, lanky and 
fondling a rose during his entrance, is hard to warm up to, and Caceres-Gerber, 
with a thin, untrained voice and unemotional presence, makes for a curiously 
unappealing center of attention. And the elements that can't be taught -- 
chemistry and charisma -- aren't here at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole advantage, one would have thought, of a student "R and J" is that 
the teen love can be real, rather than a case of the oldster pros trying to 
re-create their youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the older actors at Golden West come off better than most of the 
youngsters: Rollo Sternaman's Capulet is in fine ferocity, and Rosemary 
Stecker's Lady Capulet makes a fine match word for word. Larry L. Fisher's 
Lawrence interestingly suggests a priest young enough to understand teen 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 So does Christina Leffler's Nurse, for a while, but she too is soon afflicted 
with this show's energy crisis. Michael Richardson never works up the proper 
bile for Tybalt, and Jim Slabacheski mumbles his way through Benvolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the students will get a boost with the school's upcoming stab at that 
other "Romeo and Juliet" -- "West Side Story." Better switchblades, perhaps, 
than rapiers.

THEATER / JAN HERMAN; 'VOICE' RIDES WAVE OF RADIO NOSTALGIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a time when radio and television were considered the bane of the 
theater. They grabbed off its writers and stole its audience, at least what was 
left in the wake of the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still true today, of course. Radio and television have supplanted the 
theater in popularity and, some might say, in significance. 
</P>
<P>
 But some playwrights refuse to surrender. They turn to the electronic media as 
subjects for the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Richard Greenberg. He faces the enemy head-on in "Night and Her 
Stars," a new play that bowed last week at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg takes an acerbic look at television's cynical adolescence. He 
reinvents some of the real-life figures who were caught up in the '50s scandal 
of the rigged TV quiz shows. Then he skewers their materialistic values and 
satirizes a national mania for bogus heroes that both fostered and fed off 
insider greed. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, "Night and Her Stars" exacts the theater's revenge. Greenberg 
sees television as nothing if not an exercise in moral debasement. 
</P>
<P>
 John Olive takes an altogether different attitude toward radio, however. He 
celebrates it, even exalts it. 
</P>
<P>
 His 1986 play "Voice of the Prairie," now being revived at the Vanguard 
Theatre Ensemble in Fullerton, treats the birth of radio during the '20s like a 
nostalgic fairy tale full of homespun whimsy and romantic innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive transports us back to a time long before Howard Stern or Garrison 
Keillor. It's so long ago that Leon Schwab, the play's wandering 
broadcaster-cum-radio-salesman, touts the new technology to the farmers of 
Kansas with this quaint refrain: "The magic of the ether is the wave of the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon, who calls himself "duh voice udda prairie," hails from the East, with a 
New York accent so thick it seems more of a wonder that any of the farmers can 
understand him. But they do. 
</P>
<P>
 They start buying those newfangled radios by the armload, especially after 
Leon puts a bashful storyteller named David Quinn on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn has many tall, sad, touching stories to tell about a boy named Davey and 
his drunken Poppy and Davey's blind girlfriend Frankie, a brave and beautiful 
runaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon everyone on the prairie seems to be tuning in. Back in New York, David 
Sarnoff himself eventually hears of Quinn and offers him a show on Sarnoff's 
brand-new network, called the National Broadcasting Company. 
</P>
<P>
 As we are reminded late in the play, just in case we haven't felt the proper 
sense of awe: "The world is a strange place, isn't it, when wooden boxes can 
pull ghosts out of the sky?" 
</P>
<P>
 The amateur Vanguard production manages to capture the naive tone of the piece 
without much difficulty. Director Dan Rosenblatt keeps the action flowing among 
various times and places between 1923 and 1895 in a bare theatrical space that 
leaves scenic particulars largely to the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 The dreamlike effect of the staging suits the play's shifting landscape and 
helps mitigate the predictable routine of constant flashbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 As Quinn spins his yarns, we see them enacted: Poppy conning people for drinks 
with his gift of gab; Poppy having snake-filled nightmares of delirium tremens; 
Davey and Frankie meeting by accident; Davey and Frankie hopping boxcars 
together; Davey and Frankie catching barnyard chickens and stealing 
watermelons, Davey and Frankie being parted, seemingly forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voice of the Prairie" also delivers a final plot twist about Davey and 
Frankie that would warm the cockles of any heart. 
</P>
<P>
 As Leon, Todd Crabtree has all the gusto he needs and more. He is ebullient, 
humorous and brassy. But would someone please tell him to stop shouting? 
</P>
<P>
 John Lynd is not a natural actor and comes off stiffly as Quinn. His 
performance is likable enough, just not credible. On the other hand, he speaks 
at a conversational level -- for which this reviewer was deeply grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Kinwald offers a fine, nicely shaded portrait of Poppy. Wendy Abas is 
totally convincing as the blind Frankie; Brian Miller is fresh as Davey; Debbie 
Grattan lends texture and luminosity to Frances, an important but basically 
colorless role, and Robert Knapp fulminates effectively as James, the Methodist 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the decibel level of the entire production ought to be turned down 
and the lighting turned up. Many scenes are too dim.  
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with going in for moody lighting. But keeping scenes so 
dim as to prevent us from seeing anything except vague outlines is a bit too 
moody. 
</P>
<P>
 While radio may have been made for listening in the dark, this is still the 
theater -- isn't it?

VENTURA COUNTY NEWSWATCH

 BIT OF IRISH: Ventura County can claim a lot of local ties to the Emerald Isle 
. . . One of every five residents in half the county's cities boasts some Irish 
ancestry . . . Many of those with a bit of the Irish in them -- along with 
thousands of other county residents -- are expected to attend the ninth annual 
County Ventura St. Patrick's Day parade Saturday at 10 a.m. in downtown Ventura 
. . . As always, the wearing of the green is mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 DIGESTING THE TEST: The results of a new statewide student-testing system 
aren't going down well in some districts where the scores were low (A1) . . . 
One day after the state released results of the California Learning Assessment 
System, some school officials are coming up with a host of complaints about the 
test, including criticism of its rigorous standards . . . In Oxnard, skeptical 
officials will devise their own version of the test in eighth-grade math (B1) . 
. . "We need to know whether our students can do basic math," said Supt. Norman 
R. Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
 SEISMIC SAFETY: The Jan. 17 earthquake has pushed plans to retrofit bridges 
across the state -- including 45 in Ventura County -- into fast forward (B1) . 
. . Caltrans officials said a proposal already in place to strengthen the 
bridges will be accelerated because of the collapse of six major roadways 
during the quake . . . All of Ventura County's 322 highway bridges withstood 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 FARM HONORS: Some of Ventura County's oldest farming families will be honored 
by the California Women for Agriculture of Ventura County . . . The group will 
hold a March 17 dinner for family members and descendants of George Morton 
Richardson and George Washington Faulkner in Santa Paula and Henry Mayo Newhall 
in Piru . . . This is the ninth year the dinners have been held, said group 
President Donna Pinkerton. And given the county's deep farming roots, she said, 
"we've still got families to go." Where the Irish Are

BLACK HOMELAND REGIME APPEARS NEAR COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bizarre black homeland government of Bophuthatswana, one of the strangest 
creations of apartheid, appeared close to collapse Thursday night after four 
days of raucous strikes, running street battles and scattered gunfire in the 
tiny capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of chanting, cheering protesters celebrated by looting shops and 
burning and stoning vehicles in the dusty streets of Mmabatho after local radio 
reported that the autocratic president, Lucas Mangope, had fled by helicopter. 
His whereabouts could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mangope clearly had lost control, since his once-feared police and 
military forces were crumbling in the face of demonstrators' demands that the 
nominally independent homeland be reincorporated into South Africa and its 
voters be allowed to take part in the country's first free, all-race elections 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone in Mangope's civil service, from firefighters to teachers, 
honored a general strike Thursday to protest his repressive policies. Shops 
were shuttered, offices closed. And senior members of his handpicked 
administration had deserted the smoke-filled, embattled capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a president without any people," David Van Wyk, a striking teacher, said 
in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, hundreds of local troops and police had joined the 
uprising, allowing students to climb atop armored military vehicles and 
defiantly wave flags in support of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Some soldiers shed their uniforms or handed their weapons to demonstrators who 
ran and danced along Lucas Mangope Highway. One policeman stood atop his 
vehicle, using its loudspeaker to chant over and over, "We want peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "The police were dancing in the streets with the people," said Joyce Molaoloa, 
another striking teacher. "I saw it. They said they will harass the people no 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Police also stood by as mobs tore down traffic signs, burned tires, stripped 
trees and smashed scores of windows to plunder an upscale shopping complex 
called MegaCity. Crowds streamed from the site carrying clothes, whiskey, 
televisions, sofas and computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people, including a policeman, were reported killed and more than 70 
injured in clashes this week. At least 37 were wounded Wednesday by police 
firing buckshot and tear gas in tense running battles through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 South African President Frederik W. de Klerk told reporters that he is 
watching the crisis but had no immediate plans to send troops to quell the 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Mandela said that he had "done everything in my power" to get 
Mangope to join the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 International observer missions, who are flooding into South Africa for the 
elections, issued an appeal for peace. "We deplore the use of force and call on 
all concerned, and particularly the security forces of Bophuthatswana, to 
prevent further casualties and loss of life," said the statement, issued by the 
U.N., Organization of African Unity, European Union and Commonwealth observer 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mmabatho was quiet by midnight, residents said, with police manning roadblocks 
around government buildings and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangope has refused to take part in South Africa's historic elections next 
month. More important, he announced that he would not let other political 
parties campaign in his territory nor permit polls to open for the estimated 
1.4 million voters in his nominal control. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangope, 69, insists his country is free and independent. But South Africa is 
the only nation to recognize it. He has ruled with near dictatorial powers 
since the engineers of apartheid created Bop, as it is called, and nine other 
homelands and territories in the 1970s as a way of separating the races. 
</P>
<P>
 Bop became the most successful of the homelands, drawing rich revenues from 
platinum mines and gambling casinos at Sun City. But the bulk of its budget 
still comes from Pretoria. Corruption is widely alleged, and hundreds of 
millions of dollars have been squandered on giant stadiums, a convention center 
and other facilities that are rarely if ever used. 
</P>
<P>
 All the homelands are to be abolished after the April 26-28 election and 
reincorporated into South Africa, according to the interim constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mangope has aligned himself with white separatists and Zulu nationalists 
in the so-called Freedom Alliance who have united forces to oppose the election 
and win more self-determination.

CHINESE PREMIER STRESSES ORDER, TIES ECONOMIC REFORM TO STABILITY 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid U.S. pressure and appeals from activists that his authoritarian 
government respect human rights, Chinese Premier Li Peng said Thursday that 
maintaining political order is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 In his annual report to the nation, Li indicated that the government will not 
hesitate to slow the pace of economic reforms to maintain order. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are especially anxious to cool off the economy because runaway 
inflation was a major factor behind the 1989 pro-democracy protests, whose 
leaders are at the crux of Western concern about human rights in China. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economic development is the center of all our work," Li told the 2,800 
delegates at the national legislature. "Social stability, in turn, is an 
indispensable prerequisite for economic development and smooth progress in 
reform."

 Talladega's three-term mayor has been convicted of fraud and thrown out of 
office for cashing $5,000 in city checks that were made out to a phony tree 
surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal jurors deliberated about 11 hours over three days before convicting 
Larry Barton on Wednesday of one count of fraud and 26 counts of money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, Barton was automatically removed from office. He faces up to 
56 months in prison when he is sentenced April 22. He was allowed to remain 
free on bond pending appeal.

 Former Black Panther Party leader Eldridge Cleaver says he was robbed the day 
before he was found wandering the streets with a major head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Cleaver, 58, told Inspector Al Bierce about the robbery during a 
brief interview Wednesday at Alta Bates Medical Center, where he was recovering 
from a brain hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his condition, Cleaver was unable to provide details about the 
robbery or describe his attacker, Lt. Michel de Latour said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Answering questions was not easy for him," de Latour said. "He did establish 
that he was robbed." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaver was rushed to the hospital March 1 after he collapsed in a jail cell. 
He underwent emergency surgery later that day for a buildup of fluid between 
the outer layer of the brain and the skull. His surgeon says the injury was 
caused by a blow on the head that occurred 12 to 24 hours before police took 
Cleaver into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaver was cited for public intoxication and possession of crack cocaine and 
a crack pipe, but authorities might drop the charges in light of his injuries.

OPPOSITION GROWS TO PARKLAND PLAN FOR THE PRESIDIO

 A Tennessee congressman's efforts to prevent the Army from transferring the 
Presidio to the National Park Service is gaining momentum and has put local 
representatives on guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army is scheduled to begin turning over the nearly 1,500 acres of prime 
oceanfront property to the Park Service in October, as mandated under a 1972 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. John Duncan (R-Tenn.) says making it all into a national park would 
be too costly. Duncan wants to give the deed to the 218-year-old Army post to a 
public corporation that could sell the golf course, Letterman Army Hospital and 
other medical research facilities on the base to the highest bidder to pay the 
up-front costs of the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan's plan, contained in a bill he is introducing in Congress, would scale 
back the Presidio park to 200 acres and convert the remaining 1,288 acres, 
including most of the historic buildings, to other unspecified uses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a very serious fight," said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), 
who supports handing over most of the land to the Park Service.

RON HARRIS: A LEGISLATIVE CON JOB ON JUVENILE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It didn't take me long to realize that I'd been had. A bunch of faded faces 
peeking out of drab suits had fooled me with the oldest trick in the book, the 
bait and switch. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been invited to speak before a state legislative committee on the 
subject of juvenile justice. Now politicians don't normally seek advice from 
reporters, but because I'd produced an extensive series on the subject, talking 
to hundreds of people around the country and reviewing thousands of pages of 
documents on the issue, they said they figured I might have something to say. 
</P>
<P>
 They invited a bunch of other people too -- among them, Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, Barry Krisberg of the National Council on Crime and 
Delinquency, the heads of the juvenile probation departments for Los Angeles 
and Orange counties and the head of the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing organizers said they wanted to hear from us about effective 
strategies for dealing with juvenile crime. That was the bait. But after we got 
up to talk, we got the switch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What became quickly apparent to me and most of the other speakers was that we 
weren't there to help our legislators make California safer for citizens, just 
safer for politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Charles R. Quackenbush was leading the charge. Quackenbush is 
pushing a bill to try juveniles as young as 14 as adults. In a virtual feeding 
frenzy, the idea has caught on. Right now, there are 13 bills circulating to 
try more kids as adults or otherwise get tougher. None of them will reduce 
juvenile crime. None of them will make you or me any safer, and the legislators 
all know it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of preventing juvenile crime, I don't think (our bill) does that," 
admitted Rex Frazier, legislative analyst for Quackenbush. Ask the others and 
they should tell you the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 They know it won't work because it has never worked. In New York state, a 
study found that lowering the age at which kids can be tried as adults had no 
impact on juvenile crime. Instead, it went up. Florida, which tries more 
juveniles as adults than any state in the nation, has one of the highest rates 
of violent juvenile crime in the country -- and it has increased since the 
state began trying more juveniles as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an illusion," Krisberg said to me after the hearing. "What you've got in 
there are a bunch of ambitious politicians defrauding the public into thinking 
that trying more juveniles as adults is really going to make any meaningful 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, all of this stuff is old hat. For the past 17 years, the state 
Legislature has been passing laws to try children as adults under the guise 
that they were doing something to decrease crime. They started in 1977, with 
something called 707B, a state statute that placed the burden on kids accused 
of six crimes -- murder, rape and armed robbery, among them -- to prove that 
they should be tried in juvenile court -- otherwise, they'd be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 But violent juvenile crime continued upward. 
</P>
<P>
 So they came back a few years later and added some more crimes to the list: 
sodomy, child molestation, oral rape and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 But violent juvenile crime kept climbing. So they came back and added some 
more crimes: attempted murder, assault with a firearm, drug manufacturing, 
torture, escape by force. This has continued until the number has now reached 
24 crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 And juvenile crime continues climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Legislature increased the penalties and took away judicial 
discretion until California had the toughest juvenile system in the country. 
One of every four kids in custody in America is in California, where the 
average juvenile does more time behind bars for crimes than do adults convicted 
of the same offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 And juvenile crime . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why would our state legislators pass bills that they know won't do any good? 
Because, according to the people who work in their offices, they are more 
afraid of the public than they are of the criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 They've seen the reports and studies showing that early intervention is the 
most effective way to keep you and me from getting robbed, stabbed, carjacked 
or murdered by some kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "They fear if they propose programs that talk about intervention, they will be 
accused of throwing money at the problem or social engineering," said a 
legislative aide who works for an assemblyman proposing one of those tougher 
juvenile laws. 
</P>
<P>
 (I guess they don't call $35,000 a year to put a kid behind bars throwing 
money at a problem, or placing a kid on the path to become a career criminal 
social engineering. ) 
</P>
<P>
 The word is that just about all of these get-tough-on-juveniles bills will 
pass. So Los Angeles and California won't be any safer for you and me, but it 
will be for politicians.

WHEN THE PATIENT IS ALSO AN EXPERIMENT; FEDS FIND FAULT WITH UCLA SCHIZOPHRENIA 
STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few of the miracle drugs and treatments we take for granted today would have 
been possible without ultimately testing them on humans. But the process by 
which that was done, at least by today's prevailing ethic, was often abusive. 
For 40 years starting in 1932, the U.S. Public Health Service studied 399 black 
men with syphilis in Alabama to compare their health with 401 men who did not 
have the disease. The doctors let them die without telling them they were part 
of a study and without treating them -- even after penicillin came along. And 
during the 1940s and 1950s numerous Americans were the unwitting subjects of 
classified studies on the effects of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA SUICIDE: It is unlikely such lapses could occur today. But medicine is 
still vexed by the issue. On Wednesday a federal agency rebuked UCLA for an 
experiment in which researchers removed schizophrenic patients from medication; 
some later had severe relapses and one committed suicide. The agency said the 
patients were not properly advised of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 20 years ago, Congress passed a law to protect human subjects. It 
resulted in rules requiring each university and hospital to establish a board 
to evaluate research proposals and make sure each subject gave "informed 
consent." But those boards have operated with varying effectiveness and little 
federal oversight. It took Robert Aller, the father of one of the UCLA 
subjects, years of pressure on Congress and publicity to get the federal Office 
of Protection From Research Risks to probe the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA affair offers a good case study of the dilemma facing modern medical 
experimenters. Many patients with debilitating diseases volunteer to take 
personal risks to advance knowledge. And the UCLA researchers had good 
intentions. Schizophrenia medicines like Prolixin have bad side effects 
including involuntary movements and muscular stiffness. They wanted to devise 
strategies for taking patients off medication for extended periods. 
</P>
<P>
 During one such period, Aller's son Gregory threatened his parents and 
suffered hallucinations. Another patient off medication, Antonio Lamadrid, 
jumped to his death from a UCLA building. The federal rebuke faults the written 
consent form, which did not specify how severe the relapses could be. The 
researchers maintain that they gave this information orally and say the study 
included a "clinical override" by which they "immediately evaluated" subjects 
who displayed psychotic symptoms and recommended medicine. That is hard to 
square with the Aller and Lamadrid cases, though one of the researchers, Dr. 
Keith H. Nuechterlein, a psychologist, says that patients often refuse 
medication and it is difficult to determine clinically how severe a relapse is. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has agreed to strengthen its procedures, making changes in the 
informed-consent forms, adding a "subject representative" to the internal 
review board and setting up a monitoring system to oversee studies in which 
researchers are responsible for both research and care of subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 EMPTY EXERCISE: That is good, but it may take more. Alexander M. Capron, 
professor of law and medicine at USC, says that review boards often approve 
studies on the basis of the researchers' reputations and patient consent 
becomes a hollow ritual. And the boards operate on an "assurance" model, 
meaning that the federal government, which supports most biomedical research, 
accepts the judgments without review unless a problem crops up later. 
</P>
<P>
 Some medical ethicists argue against doing research in which known treatments 
are withheld and the patient is certain to regress during the study. We 
disagree. But there must be much better oversight, improved patient consent and 
closer monitoring of subjects to ensure that they can be rescued from the kind 
of untoward results that marred the UCLA experiment.

KANTOR'S CANDOR; STRAIGHT TALK FROM TRADE ENVOY IN REPLY TO JAPAN-POLICY 
CRITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blunt talk is not the usual tool of diplomacy. But U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor isn't the conventional diplomat. In a speech Wednesday, Kantor 
took on the United States' European allies for knocking President Clinton's 
tough trade stance with Japan.By describing the U.S. recipe for easing the 
$60-billion trade imbalance as a version of "managed trade," some high-level 
Europeans -- most recently Peter Sutherland, head of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade -- have, in effect, been siding with Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor would have none of that. "It shouldn't escape our attention (that) the 
European Union has been just as frustrated as the United States in opening the 
Japanese market," he said, " . . . the Europeans are always delighted when they 
can hold our coats and we can go out and get our noses bloodied." (See today's 
Commentary page for more.) Kantor also noted the hypocrisy of Europeans 
accusing the U.S. of violating free trade as they protect their own markets 
(e.g., broadcast materials). 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor is right: Japan needs to be more open. But if there is an Achilles' 
heel in the U.S. strategy, it is in the perception -- an incorrect one 
perpetuated by Tokyo -- that Japan must commit itself to setting specific 
market shares. That would be managed trade. The Administration needs to make 
clear that the goal is to eliminate barriers, such as in the Motorola case, not 
to set quotas. To elucidate, Kantor could point to the insistence of Tokyo, 
which only recently let U.S. rice in, that foreign rice be mixed with domestic 
rice. Now that's managing trade.

THE RAPIDS OF WHITEWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A congressional investigation of the Whitewater affair now seems not just 
possible but inevitable. Probably it is some months off. Republicans who are 
pushing for hearings say they are ready to wait while a federal grand jury in 
Washington hears testimony involving possible criminal wrongdoing.That is a 
responsible course, and the congressional Democratic leadership, rather than 
trying to block an investigation, should seek an early compromise on just what 
one would involve. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of 10 White House employees subpoenaed by the grand jury, including 
two members of Hillary Rodham Clinton's staff, were heard Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 White House staff members, it was learned last week, had been briefed on the 
tangled Whitewater affair by federal regulators, raising serious concerns about 
whether the investigation was compromised. Those concerns have already forced 
the resignation of Bernard Nussbaum, the President's counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 In these circumstances Republicans, quite naturally, scent scandal and with it 
political opportunity. But to dismiss their clamor for congressional 
involvement as solely a product of partisanship would be to demean the 
legislative role. Congress' legitimate oversight responsibilities should not be 
in dispute. Disturbing questions have been raised ranging from the possible 
illegal diversion of funds from a federally regulated bank in the 1980s to 
possible obstruction of justice just in recent months. Answers are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. fears that hearings could jeopardize 
potential prosecutions arising from his investigation. An agreement by 
Republicans not to compel testimony with grants of immunity is designed to 
alleviate that worry. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflict need not inevitably arise between Congress and the special counsel. 
Both should be committed only to getting at the truth in the Whitewater case. 
Is that too much to ask?

RETROACTIVE TAXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "If Taxes Can Be Retroactive to 1993, Why Not to 1990?" (Commentary, Feb. 
28), I wholeheartedly agree with Joseph Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
 That a small body of representatives (Congress) can tax anyone retroactively 
is pitiful. That the President would condone it (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
Act of 1993) is incomprehensible. Further, that the Supreme Court might support 
retroactive taxes would be demoralizing. That it has taken eight years for the 
Carlton case to reach the Supreme Court is disgusting. 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't Clinton and his entourage just come out to the streets, hats in 
hand, and panhandle, crying, "Alms for the poor." I'm sure that "we the people" 
will give them our two cents.

<P>
 * In their article "Long a Haven for the Lawless, Beirut Declares War on 
Crime" (Feb. 19), Mark Fineman and Marilyn Raschka gave the impression that a 
new age of law, order and calm has dawned in Lebanon. Contrary to their claims, 
Lebanese citizens are subjected to terror, bombing, assassination, abduction 
and detention without charge.Torture and extortion are widespread under the 
shadow of Syrian occupation and Damascus continues to harbor terrorist 
organizations and practice the production and trafficking of drugs in Lebanon. 
Syria is not a helpful force in Lebanon, as claimed by the article, and Syrian 
dictator Hafez Assad is not a man of peace in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 There is enough at stake for the U.S. to put more than lip service to the 
issue of Syrian occupation of Lebanon. The country must restore its 
sovereignty, independence and freedom. The United States should withdraw its 
recognition of the Syrian-installed Lebanese regime and push for the formation 
of a provisional government of national salvation that would be charged with 
organizing free elections under international supervision after the complete 
withdrawal of the Syrian army and all other foreign forces. Decoupling Lebanon 
from Syria is the only way to put an end to disorder, instability and the 
intolerable human rights conditions.

HENRY CISNEROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In recent weeks, there have been numerous articles and public views on "how 
things should have been handled" regarding the response to emergency housing 
needs for quake victims. Despite negative reports of FEMA's handling of the 
situation, with all fairness we should applaud HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros for 
his personal, pro-active role and commitment in expediting our quake-damaged 
revitalization.Looking at past administrations' response in the wake of 
Hurricane Andrew and other disasters, one can only be impressed by what 
Cisneros has accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 In just one year in office, Cisneros and HUD have had to deal with several 
natural disasters. Due to Cisneros' leadership, HUD has responded swiftly to 
meet victims' needs. Cisneros' actions deserve individual recognition, and 
should not simply be a credit on the President's approval rating. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope President Clinton acknowledges the asset that Cisneros has been, and 
will compliment him for his fruitful and constructive efforts on our behalf.

FLOGGING IN SINGAPORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Ohio Youth to Be Flogged in Singapore," March 4: 
</P>
<P>
 If the threat of flogging is what it takes to keep your city free of graffiti, 
then we have a lot to learn from Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 When we have visitors from other countries we expect them to abide by our laws 
and customs. It is only fair for us to abide by their laws and customs whenever 
we visit them.  
</P>
<P>
 I am tired of seeing graffiti in our city and if we had a few "floggings" 
instead of the "slap on the wrist," we might have a graffiti-free city. Which 
is worse, a scar on the person doing the graffiti, or scars on the whole city? 
</P>

<P>
 * The report on a Singapore court's conviction and sentencing of American 
Michael Peter Fay for vandalism ended on the note that caning is mandatory for 
"a foreigner overstaying a tourist visa." This is very misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Social visitors to Singapore are given visas of at least two-weeks' duration, 
although on average a tourist stays in Singapore for only a few days. Visa 
extensions are given liberally on application for those who wish to remain 
longer. If a visitor overstays his visa he is usually let off with a warning. 
It is those who overstay their visa by a few months who face the prospect of 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Caning is reserved as a form of punishment only for those who overstay their 
visas by more than 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists, therefore, have no reason to worry about visiting Singapore. Last 
year we had a little over 6 million tourists. They are proof of the gracious 
treatment accorded in Singapore to all bona fide tourists.

<P>
 * The most appalling thing about this is that the flogging component of the 
sentence seems to evoke more outrage in Americans than the four months in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 When Americans want to get tough on crime, they routinely propose longer 
prison sentences -- which cost a lot of money but manifestly do not deter 
crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the apparent lack of proportionality between Fay's sentence and that 
of his Malaysian co-defendant sentenced to probation, the bottom line is that 
Singapore has a criminal justice system that works and we do not. The 
disheartening thing for me as an American and a lawyer is that this incident is 
"likely to strain U.S. relations with a longtime ally" instead of acting as a 
"wake-up call" to the U.S. criminal justice system. What is broken should be 
fixed. What works should be left alone.

 * The youth being flogged in Singapore is a criminal. He had to know the laws 
of the country in which he and his family are guests. It was his choice to 
break those laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore's populace enjoy a crime-free environment because its law 
enforcement and judiciary keep it that way. No one there is above the law -- 
not even spoiled Americans who refuse to accept responsibility for their 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent time in Singapore, I believe America should follow Singapore's 
example of how to treat criminal offenders.

<P>
 * The Singapore government should stop wasting its advertising money on 
tourism promotion because travelers are not going to be interested in visiting 
a country where peoples' bodies are permanently mutilated by abusive government 
order for petty crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Given that there are cultural differences between countries and that the 
teen-ager was acting maliciously (and very foolishly in view of the mores of 
Singapore), the judge should know that the world in general has matured out of 
brutal punishment. Singapore may not have graffiti but their officials' view of 
humanity stinks on ice. 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible that by the time the boy gets back to the United States and 
finishes the talk-show circuit, no one will want to go to Singapore or even 
look at a Rose Parade float from Singapore. I certainly have no desire to 
travel there.

LOS ANGELES MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Sitting back after the ninth Los Angeles Marathon nursing sore legs and 
blisters the size of golf balls, I realize that there are quite a few people 
that I must thank for the seemingly incongruous smile on my face. 
</P>
<P>
 First, thanks to the planners behind the race who designed a course that took 
the runners through the best examples of the cultural diversity that makes us a 
great city. Thanks to the seemingly endless supply of volunteers who woke up 
early on a Sunday morning to hand out water and Gatorade to 19,000 sweaty 
runners. Thanks to all the musicians who provided the soundtrack to our 
self-inflicted agony. Thanks to the guy I nearly knocked over at Mile 2 who 
just smiled and said, "No problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the deity of your choice who came through with perfect weather for 
the race. Thanks to my friends and family who braved closed roads and crowds to 
come watch me stumble across the finish line. Thanks to the crowds who made it 
seem like running 26.2 miles is something worth doing. Thanks to the woman at 
Mile 24 who saw my face and urged me to keep going. Thanks to the guy at the 
parking lot who found just one more space so that I could make it to the start 
line on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to all those kids lining the race with outstretched hands whose smiles 
and good wishes made it seem so ignoble to quit, even though my legs were 
asking for asylum. Thanks to all the people of Los Angeles who came together 
for the day to show that Los Angeles is more than just a CNN disaster dateline. 
If there are any of you who gave any of us a kind smile or an encouraging word, 
thanks to you too. It really helps.

 * I ran my first marathon March 6, and besides the sore muscles and finisher's 
medal, I walked away with the strongest sense of community I'd felt since 
moving here 2 1/2 years ago with my wife and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the bands playing everything from rock 'n' roll to Japanese 
drums. Or the people of various sizes, ages and colors handing us water, 
cheering us on, urging us to take one more step regardless of who we were. Or 
the little kids giving everyone who'd take the time a high five. For once this 
city that seemed so divided along ethnic and economic lines felt like a place 
where even if you didn't know everyone, you wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 In one event people from every conceivable ethnic and racial mix were standing 
together, walking together, running together in fun instead of in reaction to 
some major catastrophe. Now all L.A. has to do is figure a way to have that 
kind of fun, that kind of feeling, the rest of the year.

ON FARRAKHAN, THE LINE IN THE SAND IS WHITE; RACE RELATIONS: TIME TO CONSIDER 
WHY THE NATION OF ISLAM MESSAGE RESONATES WITH MIDDLE-CLASS BLACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, Karen Grigsby Bates writes from Los Angeles about 
modern culture, race relations and politics for several national publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Ministry of Rage," bleated Time magazine recently of its cover subject, Louis 
Farrakhan. "Why do so many blacks say he speaks for them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then it assigned a white writer to explain how black people felt. I suppose 
the magazine missed the irony in that. 
</P>
<P>
 White interpretation and construction of the black agenda is precisely why so 
many black Americans are refusing to submit to the arbitrary moral litmus test 
thrust upon them by leaders in the Jewish community regarding Farrakhan. Some 
of us are reluctant to toss the baby out with the bath water. So we applaud 
Farrakhan's efforts to make black neighborhoods safer, to persuade young men 
dangling on the precipice of self-destruction to commit themselves to a 
communal good, his independence of white approval -- and lament the parts of 
him that are anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all," points out a prominent black in the publishing industry, "people 
have been allowed to separate the racist parts of Rush Limbaugh's message from 
the non-racist segments and still be Limbaugh devotees without condemnation. 
Why should it be different with Farrakhan?" 
</P>
<P>
 Much public anxiety has focused on the violent potential from Farrakhan's 
gilded rhetoric, but the worry seems misplaced. For one thing, as Time 
correspondent Sylvester Monroe, who is black and has covered Farrakhan for more 
than a decade, points out, "The Nation of Islam, in its 60-year history, has 
done no violence to any white person. On a physical level, these guys aren't 
dangerous at all, especially when compared with the violence routinely 
practiced by the Ku Klux Klan or the Aryan Nation." Or, it could be argued, the 
radical elements of the Jewish right wing such as Baruch Goldstein, who managed 
to kill dozens of Palestinians while they prayed and derail the 
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, perhaps permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 What the editors at Time, the sociopolitical pundits and nearly everyone else 
who has focused on the issue don't worry about -- and should -- is the black 
person who may be working with or living next to them. The black people who 
have been thoroughly acculturated to the mainstream, who have been educated in 
its schools, who have worked their way partly up the ladders of influence (and, 
occasionally, power) who are so heavily invested in the system that the mere 
mention of Farrakhan's name should cause shudders. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the people who have been called upon to stand up and prove their 
Reasonable Negrohood by rejecting Farrakhan out of hand. That many have not 
bespeaks the tremendous anger in many of the most privileged African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 To the person who works and thrives largely at the sufferance of a system not 
his own -- and who is aware of the possible consequence of challenging the 
system -- Farrakhan's insistence on defining himself on his own terms, in his 
own time, is vicariously liberating. Having voluntarily forced themselves into 
a mold of someone else's making, these black people nod emphatically when 
Farrakhan points out the limitations of their influence, the actual extent to 
which they are not free. 
</P>
<P>
 So what, you ask; neither are most white people free. We all have jobs to do, 
bills to pay, lines to toe. But what white people never experience is the 
nagging (and often confirmed) suspicion that sometimes we are being asked to 
toe the line for reasons different than anyone else, reasons having to do with 
our pigment and history. 
</P>
<P>
 Six million in the Holocaust; 13 million in the Middle Passage and slavery. 
The comparisons fly back and forth, and there is no point in this Olympics of 
the Oppressed. Why bother to keep score? Blacks and Jews both have suffered. We 
both have persisted. And now we must begin to engage in some meaningful, 
perhaps uncomfortable dialogue on what lies beneath the furor over Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
 For black Americans to begin the dialogue, we must come to the table as 
equals, not because it was demanded by one side of the other. Slavery is 
finished, and so is the overseer's role. To truly repair the fractured 
relationship that exists in the two communities, black people will have to 
begin defining themselves, regardless of the consequences. And white people, 
including Jewish white people, will have to accept that this is our right.  
</P>
<P>
 Only then might we discuss what causes some black Americans to embrace 
Farrakhan despite the general opprobrium heaped on them for doing it. Make no 
mistake about it: Farrakhan is a creation of American racism. If race were not 
an ongoing problem, he wouldn't exist.

IF YOU WANT EXAMPLES OF MANAGED TRADE . . .; GEOPOLITICS: EUROPE SHOULD JOIN 
WITH THE U.S. IN TRYING TO OPEN JAPAN'S MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By U.S. Trade Representative MICKEY KANTOR addressed the Economic Strategy 
Institute and the Pacific Basin Economic Council on Wednesday in Washington. He 
was asked about European criticism of increased U.S. pressure on Japan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It shouldn't escape our attention (that) the European Union has been just as 
frustrated as the United States in opening the Japanese market, but . . . it 
also is a matter of course that the Europeans are always delighted when they 
can hold our coats and we can go out and get our noses bloodied. But we're 
happy to do that, we understand our obligations to run interference for the 
(European) Union.  
</P>
<P>
 Let me say with regard to the Union, it's interesting that there have been 
some (European) voices . . . that have said our approach in the (Japan-U.S.) 
framework . . . is managed trade. First of all, I'm not sure what managed trade 
is. Is managed trade when you have a voluntary restraint on automobiles and 
trucks at 16% in Europe, including transplant production? Naw, that wouldn't be 
managed trade, would it? No, because the Europeans did it. Now when they do it, 
that's protecting their markets and making sure it's fair. When we do it -- the 
largest open market in the world, who led Bretton Woods and GATT, have kept 
(our) markets open since the Second World War, who've led global growth, who 
have a President who made sure there was a Uruguay Round . . . who made sure 
there was a NAFTA, who made sure we're trying to open up Japanese markets -- 
that's not good enough. But we could have a voluntary restraint, we can have a 
procurement directive (as) in Europe, which says if you don't have 50% European 
content, you can be arbitrarily excluded from a bid -- but that's not managed 
trade, that's good, common sense.We can have a broadcast directive that says 
you have to have at least 50% European content on television to protect 
European culture. Well, it's interesting. Are we protecting British culture or 
Portuguese or German? I'm trying to figure out what European culture is.  
</P>
<P>
 So every time the United States wants to go out there and make sure we lead 
global growth or we try to open markets, and the Europeans believe they sort of 
can come in in our wake, they don't want to stand with us. Every time it's in 
their interest, of course, to engage in behavior which is not opening their 
markets, that's justified. 
</P>
<P>
 We all need to . . . work on a multilateral basis . . . to make sure we open 
the second-largest economy in the world. This is not ganging up on the 
Japanese; this is in everyone's interest, including the Japanese government's 
for the Japanese people. 
</P>
<P>
 So we stand ready . . . to trilateralize or multilateralize these talks. We 
welcome anyone's joining in and making sure we do this on a reasonable basis, 
but what we don't look for is criticism from those who sit on the sidelines. 
And this is not a game anymore, folks. See, we're talking about real jobs for 
real people, and for a European Union that's suffering . . . with 12% 
unemployment, I would only suggest they should work with us as we're willing to 
work with them as great allies to make sure we open markets around the world.

WOMEN'S MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM GETS MAJOR RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MARBELLA, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One heard about it on television, got in her car and just started driving from 
her home in Cincinnati. One flat tire, a smoking engine and a night spent at a 
Georgia rest stop later, she made it. 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman pleaded and cajoled until a police officer allowed her onto a 
highway in Tennessee that had been closed by an ice storm. And one managed to 
get a flight out of New York's LaGuardia Airport even after another plane 
skidded off a snow-slicked runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither rain nor snow nor a long history of being kept out of the boy's club 
of professional baseball was going to keep them from their chance to join the 
first women's minor league team, the Colorado Silver Bullets. They will play 
men's teams this summer in a barnstorming, groundbreaking series of games that 
maybe, just maybe, will lead to one of them some day breaking into the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dream. I keep pinching myself," says Lisa Fritz, 36, the Cincinnati 
woman who willed her aging car to get her to the team's final tryouts here a 
week ago -- and was one of just three out of 75 aspirants invited to spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good feeling about this, though," she says, "because when I pulled in 
here, the odometer went to '77,777."' 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky numbers -- Mickey Mantle wore No. 7 -- and all, the new team adds a 
grace note this season to this already myth-laden and sentimentalized sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball, increasingly the game of millionaires who talk to their agents on 
cellular phones from the locker room, every once in a while can still make you 
smile at its innocence: The game that has long let men remain boys now is 
letting women remain girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least dream a little bit longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 'A League of Their Own,"' says Phil Niekro, the wily knuckleballer and 
14th winningest pitcher of all time who is managing the Silver Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 That delightful 1992 movie, based on the real-life women's baseball league 
that flowered in the 1940s while the men were off fighting World War II, is 
evoked often here at the Silver Bullets spring training camp. In fact, two of 
the team members -- Julie Croteau, who became the first woman to play men's 
college ball while a student at St. Mary's College in southern Maryland, and 
K.C. Carr, a St. Louis-based actress -- were in the game scenes of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the "League of Their Own" teams played each other -- wearing short 
skirts designed more for their audiences than actual utility -- the Silver 
Bullets are affiliated with the independent Northern League of men's teams. 
But, because the novelty of baseball-playing women, even in the standard 
baseball attire of pants and jerseys, makes them such a promotional dream, they 
have been invited to play all sorts of teams this summer, including some 
minor-league teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Spring training began Monday with 49 women -- a firefighter, a lawyer and 
several mothers among them -- and perhaps even more hopes and dreams on the 
line than the men's teams also preparing for the season elsewhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Satriano, 28, an assistant district attorney who prosecutes cases in the 
Compton area of Los Angeles, still gets emotional talking about what this team 
means. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to fight to be the first girl in California to play Little League. They 
kept me from playing on the college team," Satriano says, her blue hat 
squashing a mop of curly brown hair and her eyes moistening at the memories as 
she takes the field for the team's first workout. "I'd moved on in my life. I 
thought I'd left baseball behind me. But all I ever wanted was an opportunity 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the large group of family and friends supporting her dream to play pro 
ball, one is particularly proud of her: her father, Tom Satriano, who played 
with the California Angels and the Boston Red Sox in the 1960s. "He knows, he's 
been here," she says. "I talked to him last night, and he said, 'You're going 
to have the highs and the lows. When you have the lows, call me."' 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the giddiness of getting to play real baseball -- as opposed to the 
slower-pitch softball that most of these women were shunted to around high 
school age -- is keeping any lows at bay. Just getting to this point -- some 
1,100 women attended tryouts held across the country this winter -- has been a 
cherished experience, and even the prospect of more than half of them getting 
cut before the season starts in early May can't dampen their spirits. They 
already seem like a team, with the kind of instant rapport that comes from 
shared experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like you've known each other forever," says Elaine Amundsen, 25, of 
Milford, Conn., who is delaying her training as a private investigator to play 
on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The players will be paid $20,000 for about five months of work, comparable to 
what minor leaguers make, team officials say. The team is part of the 
Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle business group -- known more for its Channel One 
television broadcasts to schools and the Edison Project, which hopes to start a 
nationwide chain of private schools -- and sponsored by Coors, and thus named 
after its light beer. 
</P>
<P>
 While some observers have expressed dismay that the team will be an 
advertisement for drinking beer, the players say the greater good of having a 
women's team outweighs such concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel this opportunity was not available to me last year, and this year it 
is, so I commend Coors," says Croteau, 23, who is as close to a name player as 
anyone on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a graduate student at Smith College, Croteau says she initially didn't 
believe it when she got a call inviting her to try out for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually, literally fell out of my chair," says Croteau, who is 
surprisingly delicate-looking and soft-spoken for someone who has battled her 
whole life to play baseball. She sued her Virginia high school, unsuccessfully, 
to play on the boys' team, and did play three seasons on the St. Mary's team, 
but left the team after what she considered harassment from some teammates and 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very passionate about baseball. It's the only thing I'd drop 
everything for," Croteau says. "I feel I've paid my dues. This time, it will 
really make a difference for the future. I don't want the girl after me to 
listen to what I had to listen to." 
</P>
<P>
 There are skeptics of course, those who think there's no way a woman can hit a 
tiny ball coming at them at 80 or 90 mph. Or pitch it at that speed after, for 
the most part, throwing a softball underhanded for most of her playing life. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the media to contend with, cynical journalists casting jaded 
eyes at their venture. "When they first asked you to do this," one reporter 
asked Niekro, "did you ever feel it was below your dignity?" 
</P>
<P>
 A photographer kept hoping to get his dream picture: a player in the locker 
room primping in a makeup mirror. (For one thing, no media people are allowed 
in these locker rooms, and for another, as with any team, Ben Gay appears to be 
more common than Maybelline.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Silver Bullet staff says even the most dismissive journalists 
usually end up impressed with the purposeful nature of the players and the 
seriousness with which the coaches are treating this from-scratch program. 
While this year's games will be just exhibitions, the team hopes to demonstrate 
a level of playing ability this season that could lead to getting ranked the 
way other minor league teams are, A through AAA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt baseball was the only good shot women have at playing at the 
professional level," says Paul Blair, the one-time Baltimore Orioles 
center-field star who was hired to work with the Silver Bullets on base-running 
and outfield skills. "I don't see women playing basketball with the big boys, 
or football, but with baseball, it's really just talent. It doesn't matter 
about your size." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a couple of 6-foot-plus players, the athletes do look rather tiny 
out on the field, which has bigger dimensions than the softball diamond most 
are used to. Most are 5-foot-5 or taller, although one is a mere 5 feet tall. 
They look like your kid sister or the neighborhood tomboy, and they've proved 
an irresistible story to the media, especially for network weekend broadcasts 
and news organizations as far afield as Japan, London and MTV. ESPN and a 
couple of networks are interested in airing some of their games this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my daughters told me, 'Daddy, you're in Vogue,"' says Bob Hope, a 
former marketing director for the Atlanta Braves and Hawks who is now president 
of the team. He'd toyed with the idea for a women's professional team for years 
and partially credits the popularity of "A League of Their Own" with finally 
making it a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 As the father of two daughters, he says, he has a personal interest in seeing 
the team succeed. "It goes beyond marketing," says Hope. "It's a legacy we can 
leave to our daughters."

CHRISTOPHER SAYS JAPAN BROKE TRADE PLEDGE; POLICY: SPEAKING HARSHLY AFTER 
FRUITLESS TALKS, THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS THAT 'GREAT NATIONS KEEP THEIR 
COMMITMENTS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After making no progress toward resolving America's economic conflict with 
Japan, Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Thursday accused Japanese 
officials of breaking their promises by failing to negotiate a new trade 
agreement with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said simply that great nations keep their commitments," Christopher said 
following meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, during a visit by President Clinton to Tokyo, Japan promised to bring 
about a "highly significant decrease" in its $120-billion-a-year trade surplus 
with the rest of the world.  
</P>
<P>
 "No one would agree with the contention that Japan has met its commitments," 
the secretary of state said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's harsh words appeared to represent an effort to place Japan on 
the defensive in the continuing conflict over the two countries' trading 
relationship. They also reflect the Clinton Administration's desire to shift 
public debate away from the details of the trade dispute and toward the 
question of whether Japan has violated its promises. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Motorola Inc. said it was making progress on a deal to improve 
its access to Japan's cellular telephone market. But that dispute, which 
prompted the Administration to threaten sanctions, is just one issue in the 
trade conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech prepared for delivery today to the Japan Assn. of Corporate 
Executives, Christopher planned to press hard at the theme that America's huge 
trade imbalance with Japan cannot be allowed to last. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the world's two largest economies, agreeing to disagree is not good 
enough," his speech reads. "I came to Japan to make sure our message is 
understood: Your government needs to take firm action to honor the commitments 
it made." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Japanese and American officials indicated Thursday that it is becoming 
increasingly unlikely that the economic frictions will ease any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa and Hata told Christopher that Japan plans to come up with a 
market-opening package "with substantial meaning" by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 But they said nothing to him about a Japanese Cabinet decision Wednesday to 
delay announcement of portions of the new package until shortly before the G-7 
summit meeting of the world's leading industrialized nations July 8-10 in 
Naples. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet decision marks Japan's second step backward, in terms of delay, 
since trade talks between the two countries broke down at the Feb. 11 summit 
between Clinton and Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There have been "some beginning hints of change in Japan's position," said a 
senior U.S. official who briefed reporters on the condition he not be named. 
But he said these have been "vague and generalized . . . and even those steps 
have been criticized within the government and in business." 
</P>
<P>
 America's trade deficit with Japan was approximately $60 billion last year and 
is expected to grow. Nevertheless, Hosokawa, in a 45-minute meeting, urged the 
Clinton Administration to be patient. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister told Christopher that "Japan is changing. Many foreigners 
may see the change as occurring slowly. But we are working steadily to carry 
out fundamental changes in our system. These will be very important changes for 
the Japanese people." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps surprisingly, there has been no sign yet that the persistent economic 
frictions are harming security ties between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior U.S. defense officials joined Christopher here for meetings with top 
officials of the Japanese Defense Agency for talks on defense issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, who stopped in Japan for a two-day visit on his way to China, was 
never expected to bring the sort of detailed proposals that would settle the 
trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 His task seems to be to tell Japan that the security-minded parts of the 
Administration, such as the State and Defense departments, support Clinton's 
hawkish policy on trade.

FLOGGING IN SINGAPORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The 18-year-old "youth" reportedly was in possession of stolen property and 
vandalized, via graffiti, several vehicles. Several people are outraged that 
the "youth" will be flogged and fined for his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watched the TV news about this incident, one fact stood out. I did not 
see one inch of graffiti anywhere else in that city. I thought about this as I 
watched Caltrans spend tax dollars cleaning up the sound walls on the San Diego 
Freeway (again). 
</P>
<P>
 I am not advocating that flogging be adopted as a punishment for graffiti or 
possession of stolen goods, but your article added that Singapore has almost no 
problems with graffiti and the subways are immaculate. This clearly shows that 
real punishment for a crime actually deters the crime in the first place.

 DISASTER: With all due respect, the Jan. 17 Northridge quake isn't the worst 
disaster we've had around here. Not even close. . . . You have to go back to 66 
years ago Saturday -- March 12, 1928. At 11:57 p.m., St. Francis Dam in 
northern L. A. County crumpled, sending billions of gallons of water down San 
Francisquito Canyon north of Saugus. The final death toll was 450. 
</P>
<P>
 COWBOY CASH: The city of Santa Clarita can't win. It has asked FEMA for 
$13,000 to help pay for moving its Cowboy Poetry, Music and Film Festival from 
a quake-damaged auditorium to another site. If they had canceled it, the city 
would have faced heavy losses in advances paid to entertainers. . . . But some 
residents say FEMA money should go to more urgent needs. (B9) 
</P>
<P>
 COPY DOGS: Some say Hollywood has gone to the dogs, and the latest is 
"Lassie," due this summer. And don't be surprised if there's a sudden rush on 
collies. "Beethoven" made St. Bernards popular, and "101 Dalmatians" did great 
business for the black-and-white dog (above). . . . "If they have seen it in a 
commercial or movie, everyone wants one," said a Valley pet store manager. See 
Valley Life! Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 COMING ATTRACTIONS: Let's say you can't wait for birth to get your new baby on 
video. Well, who says you have to wait? A couple of clever businesswomen have 
started a sonogram service in Westlake Village offering a videotape and still 
photos for $60, plus tax. . . . "I wanted to see and get to know my baby," said 
one co-owner. See Valley Life! Page 33. 
</P>
<P>
 NOW OR NEVER: The CSUN basketball team was lousy again this year, but at least 
the powerful baseball team was going to make up for it. Some idea of 
redemption. So far, the Matadors (9-10) have stumbled and need to turn it 
around immediately to make the playoffs. . . . Conference play begins at home 
today against favorite Hawaii. (C8) Michael Arkush

SURPRISE DEAL ENDS BITTER LAND BATTLE; DEVELOPMENT: IF SUPERVISORS APPROVE, 
TOPANGA CANYON PARCEL WILL BE ACQUIRED AS PARKLAND FOR $19.9 MILLION. NEARBY 
RESIDENTS HAVE FOUGHT BUILDING PLANS FOR 16 YEARS. 
</P>

 The longest land-use dispute in Los Angeles County history came to a startling 
conclusion Thursday as the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy announced that it 
would buy the site of a controversial proposed development in Topanga Canyon -- 
just minutes before the Board of Supervisors was to vote on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Topanga residents packing the board's cavernous Downtown chambers 
jumped to their feet and applauded as Supervisor Ed Edelman unveiled the 
eleventh-hour deal, which was reached in grueling overnight negotiations and is 
as historic as the tortuous tale of the project itself. 
</P>
<P>
 If the deal is approved by the board later this month, the $19.9 million the 
conservancy would pay for 662 acres in the canyon's Summit Valley area would be 
the highest price paid by the state agency for any property since it was 
created in 1979. The conservancy intends to preserve the land in its natural 
state for use by the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The move scotches plans to develop Canyon Oaks Estates -- a proposed private 
golf course and 97 luxury homes on 257 acres -- and ends a nasty fight pitting 
neighbor against neighbor that began 16 years ago when a different developer 
proposed a similar but much larger project. 
</P>
<P>
 Years of vehement community protest appeared to have taken their toll, in what 
detractors considered a rare victory against a well-financed opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Wilson, president of the Canyon Oaks Estates partnership, said the 
corporation was tired of fighting a battle that he said in recent months had 
degenerated into smear tactics and personal attacks. He said the corporation, 
which is part of a Disney family trust, will lose money in the deal -- money he 
said can not be recouped through tax write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to reach a resolution," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Oaks had rejected previous purchase offers from the conservancy, a 
state agency that has acquired more than 20,000 acres in the Santa Monica 
Mountains for use as public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very positive first step," said Wilson, who helps manage the family 
trust established by the late Sharon Disney Lund, daughter of Walt Disney. 
Canyon Oaks is part of that trust, which is unrelated to other ventures of the 
Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Thursday's announcement, plans to develop Canyon Oaks Estates will 
remain before county officials. If supervisors and the conservancy fail to 
finalize the deal before April 5, Wilson said, the corporation will press 
forward with its development proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the conservancy, said he does 
not expect any difficulty in realizing the agreements reached during a 19-hour 
negotiation session that ended at dawn Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money for the purchase -- about $14.1 million -- will come 
immediately from Proposition A funds already earmarked for land acquisition in 
the Santa Monica Mountains. The remainder -- about $5.8 million -- will be due 
in August, 1995, and will come either from a statewide parks initiative or 
through fund-raising efforts, Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors, who have final say over disbursement of Prop. A funds, are 
scheduled to vote March 29 on releasing the initial $14.1 million to the 
conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes of the deal's announcement, Topanga residents who an hour 
earlier had been noisily picketing the project outside the county building, 
were shaking hands with Canyon Oaks lawyers and managers, promising to work 
together to make sure the agreement holds. 
</P>
<P>
 To all but the tiny group of negotiators, news of the deal was a surprise. "I 
was like totally shocked," said Roger Pugliese, vice chairman of the Topanga 
Assn. for a Scenic Community and one of the project's most vociferous critics. 
"But it could not have gone better."

UCLA TO SELL PART OF FACULTY SUBDIVISION; REAL ESTATE: WESTCHESTER HOUSES WILL 
BE OFFERED TO THE PUBLIC. THEY WERE BUILT TO LURE PROFESSORS, BUT FEW HAVE 
BOUGHT THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA officials announced Thursday they will allow the public to buy up to two 
dozen homes in a largely vacant Westchester subdivision originally built 
exclusively for professors, conceding it was the only way to keep from losing 
money on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The university built the $42-million subdivision of 86 homes -- called The 
Bluffs for its hilltop views of the ocean -- to help recruit senior faculty 
members who might be tempted to turn down job offers because they could not 
afford a home in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceived during the 1980s real estate boom, the idea was for the school to 
offer the three- to five-bedroom homes, located about 30 minutes from the 
Westwood campus, to incoming UCLA faculty at prices as much as 30% below market 
value. A 1987 housing survey suggested that nearly 60% of faculty recruits 
would buy such houses and that the mid-$400,000 to high-$600,000 prices would 
be within the reach of 129 new professors over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the project was completed last fall, UCLA couldn't find a 
single buyer. Housing prices had taken a 30% nose-dive, wiping out any bargain 
appeal, and state budget woes forced the university to curtail its hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials hoped to spur interest by dropping prices an average of 
$35,000 on each home and offering flooring and landscaping upgrades. But only 
seven faculty members have purchased homes, said Brad Erickson, UCLA's 
associate director of real estate. Two others have signed leases with options 
to buy -- one family that was displaced by last fall's Malibu fire and another 
displaced by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At that rate, it would take UCLA more than three years to sell off all of the 
homes to its faculty -- not fast enough to repay the First Interstate Bank 
construction loan and recover all the project's costs, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have a loss and the only way to avoid the loss is to open it up to 
the public," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The original loan agreement requires UCLA to repay the full $42 million to 
First Interstate in June and obligates Chancellor Charles E. Young to use other 
campus funds if housing sales fail to cover the debt. But a spokesman for the 
UC treasurer's office in Oakland said Thursday that the university system is 
engaged in "positive negotiations" with the bank to restructure UCLA's 
repayment. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving permission from University of California regents in January, 
Young finally decided Thursday morning to allow the public purchases of the 
homes, Erickson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The chancellor clearly, clearly is upset that this is something that has to 
be done, but he recognizes that it's really a prudent thing to do," Erickson 
said. "He's not upset simply at the fact that we have to sell a few homes to 
the public. What's frustrating to him is that it highlights what's happening to 
the university generally." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 people not affiliated with UCLA have signed up for a chance to 
buy the homes, he said. They will be allowed to tour selected models, most 
likely at the end of the month, and will be invited to submit bids that could 
be unsealed in early April. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these homes on the bluffs are premium homes with premium views, and 
we want to capture that premium," Erickson said. "We want to at least break 
even on this project, and the only way to do that is to go out to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 After selling off the first two dozen, Erickson said UCLA will re-examine its 
future faculty recruiting plans and may make more homes available to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world has changed and we did not foresee the extent the world would 
change, in terms of local real estate prices and what has happened to the state 
and university," Erickson said. "If the university were prospering wildly, a 
decision might have been made to hold on to this project for its institutional 
purpose. But the university, like everyone in Southern California, has been 
suffering and has got to cut its losses."

MAKING FRIENDS OF OLD ENEMIES; WORLD WAR II HOBBYIST RESEARCHES DOGFIGHTS TO 
REUNITE AMERICANS WITH JAPANESE ADVERSARIES

<P>
 That isn't a canopy of palm fronds or fruit tree branches that Henry Sakaida 
sees when he sometimes gazes up from his wholesale nursery in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 In his mind, Sakaida is looking into a sky full of roaring Corsairs and 
cannon-firing Zeros -- nimble World War II fighters locked in combat over South 
Pacific islands named Bougainville and Guadalcanal. 
</P>
<P>
 And inside the warplane cockpits, Sakaida sees the young faces of men such as 
Wendell Twelves and William Hopper and Sadamu Komachi and Yasushi Kanai. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakaida knows the terror all four pilots are experiencing as they dance their 
deadly ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows because they've told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years after the war, Sakaida has an unusual hobby: He hunts down former 
air combat adversaries in hopes of turning enemies into friends. 
</P>
<P>
 So far he has tackled nearly 75 dogfights and claims a 90% success rate in 
identifying the participants. Some fliers want to face their former enemies 
again. Other's don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very professional when they meet in person. There's no animosity, 
they talk shop," Sakaida says. "They inevitably ask each other, 'What did you 
think of us?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Each side usually admits to being impressed by the other. They are saddened if 
they learn their adversary didn't survive the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, those actions seemed very impersonal," said pilot Robert W. 
Wilson of Fallbrook after Sakaida identified Munetoshi Harada as the pilot of 
the Zero he shot down March 12, 1944, over New Britain, an island off Papua, 
New Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was man (me) against machine (him). But when you put the name of the 
Japanese as Harada, it makes it so human. It all seems so pointless." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiosity about the personal part of war led Sakaida, 42, to his unusual 
detective work. 
</P>
<P>
 As a boy, he enjoyed gluing together model warplanes and then crashing and 
burning them in the back of his family's Grand Avenue nursery grounds. One day 
he decided to find out who flew the real ones and faced the real-life dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 13 when he got the address of a war history center in Tokyo. His 
father, Tadashi, translated into Japanese his request for information about 
zero pilots. Eventually, he was corresponding directly with Japanese combat 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 His first case came in 1975 when a former zero pilot asked him to help 
identify the American who had shot him down 31 years earlier over Guam. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakaida engineered his first face-to-face reunion in 1983. Onetime fighter 
pilot Saburo Sakai met former U.S. Navy dive bomber gunner Harold L. Jones of 
Unionville, Nev., and several others who had battled him in a 1942 dogfight 
over Guadalcanal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakai, now a business consultant, brought along his battered flight helmet and 
showed its bullet holes to Jones, who now runs a bed and breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought you were gone," said Jones, whose own plane had 232 bullet holes in 
it when it landed. Sakai replied: "This is just like a dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Another dozen or so sets of former enemies now correspond by mail. Many are 
planning their own reunions. But they're in their 70s now, and some will never 
get the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendell Twelves, a retired steel company administrator from Springville, Utah, 
died three months before former enemy Sadamu Komachi traveled to the United 
States in 1992 in hopes of seeing him. Twelves had blasted him from the skies 
over Guam in June, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband was really looking forward to meeting him," said LaRhea Twelves. 
"Mr. Komachi bore no bitterness. He wanted to meet the pilot who shot him down 
and give him a big hug and congratulate both for surviving the war." 
</P>
<P>
 Sakaida does his research for free. Detailed U.S. combat records are 
available, but most Japanese records were destroyed after the war. So he draws 
from the memories of Japanese pilots and statistics kept by various veterans 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 He often discovers that the man he is looking for died in the war. But one of 
his searches cleared up a 49-year mystery over an American flier listed as 
missing in action in the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese pilot Ryoji Ohara told Sakaida he remembered a 22-year-old pilot from 
Michigan who had been captured after parachuting out of his P-38 fighter. The 
American had been friendly and had given his flight helmet to his captors as a 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakaida identified the American in 1992 as Wellman Huey. When a Detroit 
newspaper reported his discovery, Sakaida was quickly contacted by Huey's 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have somebody close just disappear and you don't know what happened, 
it's difficult," said Don Huey of Rochester Hills, Mich. "I'd like to find out 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Hopper, a 72-year-old retired Oakland educator and ex-Marine Corps 
pilot, wrote to the zero pilot he fought over New Britain in February, 1944, 
after Sakaida supplied the man's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither flier had been hurt in the skirmish: "We were both fortunate," Hopper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopper's adversary, Yasushi Kanai, became president of a fabric company. "We 
both have strong luck," Kanai wrote him back. "Our lives are not much longer, 
so let's live life to the fullest." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopper said he hopes to meet Kanai. "Fifty years ago is ancient history. . . . 
Henry's helping heal the old wounds," Hopper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are not eager to reopen old wounds, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Westbrook of Huntsville, Tex., was jolted to learn that the Japanese 
pilot who shot down his brother wanted to contact him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robert Westbrook-Hayao Fujimoto dogfight occurred near Okinawa 48 years 
ago. Last October, Fujimoto wrote Westbrook's brother and voiced sorrow that 
Robert Westbrook had not been rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote him back a nice letter saying I was glad he survived and saying he 
was doing the same thing for his country that my brother was doing for his," 
Jack Westbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't know I necessarily want to turn it into a pen-pal relationship. 
There's nothing to celebrate. It rekindled the grief." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Frensley, a retired newspaper publisher from Norman, Okla., has no desire 
either to meet the Japanese pilot who apparently rammed his B-29 bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakaida learned that Masao Kato was struggling with his jammed machine gun 
when he accidentally smashed into Frensley's plane over Tokyo in December, 
1944. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happy to hear that all those involved were able to return home safely to 
base," said Kato, now a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Frensley said: "Quite frankly, I have no desire to meet this guy. I don't want 
to seem callous. But what would I do? Shake his hand?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sakaida presses on, however.  
</P>
<P>
 His files on pilots have outgrown cabinets at his home in Temple City and 
spilled into cardboard boxes. His wife, Donna, and children Eren, 10, and 
Allison, 7, have learned to hunker down in another room with computer games 
when he sits down to his real war games. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite his reputation as an aviation expert, Sakaida has no desire to 
take to the air. He doesn't even care for jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," he said. "I don't feel comfortable flying."

LAPD COMMANDER DENIES RAPING OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles police commander, accused by a subordinate officer of rape, 
testified Thursday that his encounter with the officer was mutually enjoyable 
sex between consenting adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-ranking officer said his accuser had in fact pursued him. He said she 
set up the March 31, 1992, meeting in his Westchester apartment during which 
they had sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
 In a federal lawsuit against the city and the commander, the officer accused 
him of raping her after inviting her to his apartment under the pretext of 
offering advice. Her suit alleges that her civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the commander, who was cleared by an internal police tribunal of 
any wrongdoing and remains on duty, was firm in his reply when asked whether he 
raped the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely not!" the commander said. "I would not rape (her) or any other 
woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times is not publishing the names of the officer and the commander she has 
accused. It is the newspaper's policy generally not to name alleged victims of 
sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander, 58, said he met the officer, 34, when he answered one of 
numerous anonymous calls she made to his office seeking advice about her 
marital and career troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no trauma in her voice," he said. "She was very cavalier; she was 
not upset." 
</P>
<P>
 After a couple of initial conversations, he said, the officer identified 
herself. The commander said she told him that she "loved talking to him" and 
that she "loved" to hear the sound of his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 She asked to meet, the commander said. He suggested Denny's, he said, but she 
said, "I'm not hungry, I don't want to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 The commander said he was hesitant to suggest meeting at his apartment, but he 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instantly, she said, 'That will be great.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He said they met at his apartment, where they talked for more than an hour on 
the couch. 
</P>
<P>
 She touched his hand briefly, and he said he could see there was a "personal 
interest" developing. They moved closer on the couch, he said, starting to 
"caress each other's bodies." They embraced and kissed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he said, they went to the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander said the officer was "very passionate." 
</P>
<P>
 The officer contends that he forced her to have sex, telling her: "This won't 
take long, I'm an old man." 
</P>
<P>
 The commander denied making the remark and said she was a willing participant 
who did not want to leave the apartment when they finished. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, he said, she left "about six messages" on his machine, calling 
to say she was thinking about him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department's internal affairs section began its investigation into 
the charges in November, 1992, after the officer told her immediate supervisors 
she had been raped. Her supervisors testified that she told them the commander 
raped her at a time when she was vulnerable and emotionally troubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the incident, she said, she has been hospitalized four times for 
depression and attempted suicide. Her medical bills are more than $90,000, the 
officer has said. She has been on disability since reporting the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Final arguments are expected today.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 28 LAX 
SHUTTLE VANS CITED FOR MECHANICAL PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of 41 passenger vans inspected at Los Angeles International Airport, Public 
Utilities Commission officials cited 28 for mechanical problems, including poor 
steering, bad brakes and bald tires. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, these numbers are quite high," PUC Commissioner Jessie Knight 
said."We are committed to assuring that any shuttle business we authorize will 
provide safe and good customer service." 
</P>
<P>
 PUC officials discovered Thursday that one company was operating illegally 
after it had been suspended by the regulatory agency because it had no 
insurance. One driver was cited because he had no driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had made progress, but today's results show we have to keep 
doing these inspections," said Larry McNeely of the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of numerous passenger complaints, Knight said, the state agency will 
open a satellite office at the airport on April 1 to increase monitoring of the 
vans. The problems have included rude drivers, overcharging and passengers 
being delayed as drivers circle the airport in search of more customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers with complaints may call (800) FON-4-PUC.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MISSING FEMA INSPECTOR 
FOUND SLEEPING IN A CAR NEAR HIS MOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A missing contract inspector for FEMA who had been the subject of an 
exhaustive search was found sleeping in a rental car Thursday near a North 
Hills motel where he had been staying, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Francis Fisher, 39, who disappeared 10 days ago, was found before dawn 
in the car parked near his Sepulveda Boulevard motel. "There are indications 
Mr. Fisher had been using cocaine in recent days," Police Lt. Gene Brummell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was down the street the whole time," said a relieved but angry Rodney 
Fisher, 31, who had been going door-to-door searching for his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The older Fisher, an Oakland construction inspector working on a Federal 
Emergency Management Agency contract checking buildings for earthquake damage, 
was last seen by colleagues on the night of March 1 as he headed for his room 
at the Comfort Inn. When he had not been seen or heard from for several days, 
his brother -- also a FEMA contract inspector from Oakland -- called the LAPD 
Missing Persons Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 A patrol officer found Robert Fisher about 2:50 a.m. when the officer stopped 
to talk to some women standing on a street corner near the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he asked the girls out there on the corner, they said, 'Yeah, he's right 
over there. We know exactly who you're talking about.' They took (the officer) 
straight to him," Rodney Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He either was or had been under the influence of coke," said Detective 
Raynette Sincosky of the Missing Persons Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 When police brought Robert Fisher back to his motel room, his brother asked 
what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had nothing to say," Rodney Fisher said. "He just looked at me. He was 
ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Fisher said he put his brother on the first plane back to Oakland on 
Thursday morning. But first, he took him to the FEMA contractor's office to 
apologize, and to drop off his FEMA-issued cellular phone and portable 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached in Oakland, Robert Fisher acknowledged that he had been missing. But 
when asked about the police allegation of alleged cocaine use, he said: "I'd 
rather get back to you on that."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: RAPPER GETS 15 DAYS IN 
JAIL FOR ATTACK ON FILM DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor and "gangsta" rapper Tupac Amaru Shakur was sentenced Thursday to 15 
days in jail, 15 days on a Caltrans work crew and 30 months probation for his 
attack last year on film director Allen Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 The case marks the second time in seven months that Shakur -- whose music has 
generated more than $10 million in sales and whose films include John 
Singleton's "Poetic Justice" -- has been prosecuted in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta entertainer was convicted in August of possessing a loaded and 
concealed firearm and still has four other cases pending against him in three 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakur, 22, sat silently through most of the 90-minute sentencing in the 
Downtown courtroom as his lawyer and the prosecutor argued about whether he 
should receive the maximum sentence of one year in jail and a $3,000 fine. He 
was convicted Feb. 10 on single counts of battery and assault for attacking 
Hughes after following him to the Downtown set of a music video. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakur spoke only to ask the court to allow him to serve his time performing 
community service work. 
</P>
<P>
 In a courtroom packed with fans and camera crews, Los Angeles Municipal Judge 
George H. Wu also sentenced the rapper to a $2,000 fine and 30 days of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu told Shakur he would have to serve an additional 24 months of summary 
probation and 20 more days of Caltrans work for the assault count if he fails 
to live up to the terms of his probation. The rapper is scheduled to be back in 
court May 10 to determine when he will report to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The battery case is only the latest in a string of legal problems for Shakur, 
who made his start as part of Oakland rap group Digital Underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakur must return March 18 to New York for a hearing on a nine-count sexual 
assault case stemming from his alleged attack on a woman last November in a 
hotel suite there. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 18, he is required to appear in an Atlanta court to face an 
outstanding charge of simple battery for allegedly slapping a woman last summer 
when she asked him for his autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapper also is awaiting the results of a grand jury investigation to 
determine whether he will face trial this summer in Atlanta on two counts of 
aggravated assault stemming from an October disturbance in which he allegedly 
shot and wounded two off-duty police officers. CHUCK PHILIPS

 Cheese Louise!Now comes word of a third candidate for the title of Father of 
the Cheeseburger. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading our column about the rival claims of Lionel Sternberger of 
Pasadena and Louis Ballast of Denver, Colo., Larry Deckel of Los Feliz informed 
us that Kaelin's restaurant in Louisville, Ky., contends that it was the first 
to slap a slice of American on a meat patty. "They've got plaques all over the 
place," Deckel said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough . . . : "Yes, (founder) Carl Kaelin came up with the idea in 
1934," said Kaelin's day manager Sean Hanley. "He was expanding his deli into a 
restaurant and since he was feeding a lot of kids from the college (University 
of Louisville), he decided to throw on some cheese and see what would happen. 
It caught on big and just spread across the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaelin's was unaware of rival claimants until 1987, when Denver authorities 
laid a granite monument on the now-vacant site of Ballast's establishment, the 
Humpty Dumpty Barrel Drive-In, where the first cheeseburger was allegedly 
served in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard it on the news," Hanley said. "Then the Chicago Tribune called. And 
a reporter from England." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Ballast's credentials, Hanley said: "He said he invented it a year later 
(than Kaelin). They put a plaque where a restaurant doesn't even exist anymore 
while our place is still here. That was sort of funny." 
</P>
<P>
 And Pasadena's Sternberger? "We never heard of him," Hanley said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Double Sternberger vote, coming up: A few years ago, as we have reported, 
American Heritage magazine said Sternberger constructed the cheeseburger in the 
1920s, meaning he would have predated Kaelin (1934) and Ballast (1935). 
</P>
<P>
 And he has picked up a second backer. Author Gloria Ricci Lothrop recently 
wrote in The Californians, a history magazine, of "the inspired union of 
hamburger and cheese first combined by the youthful cook Lionel Sternberger at 
Pasadena's Rite Spot cafe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also served here . . . : Lothrop gives L.A. additional credit for several 
other firsts, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Shirley Temple (non-alcoholic) cocktail, Cobb Salad and grapefruit cake 
(the Brown Derby). 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange Julius (Willard Hamlin). (Did Hamlin think that title sounded 
snappier than Orange Willard?) 
</P>
<P>
 * Chiffon cake (Harry Baker, a Hollywood insurance salesman). 
</P>
<P>
 * Veal Oskar (Scandia's Kenneth Hansen). 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the exotic concoction of Art Elkinal, who "in 1935 . . . 
sold both hot dogs and chili from his pushcart in Inglewood. When someone 
suggested that he place the chili atop, the chili dog was created." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see someone try to take that title away from Southern California. LAny: 
</P>
<P>
 The Hula-Hoop, whose invention forms the plot of the coming fictional movie, 
"The Hudsucker Proxy," was also a local contribution, introduced by Wham-O of 
San Gabriel in 1958. During the resulting craze, the company sold 25 million of 
the toys, priced at $1.98, in three months.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MONTEREY PARK; MAHONY 
GIVES LATINO PARISH APOLOGY BUT NO CONCESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has apologized to parishioners of St. Thomas Aquinas 
Church in Monterey Park for causing any "unnecessary hurts," but said he stands 
firm on a decision to turn the mainly Latino parish into a center for Chinese 
American evangelism. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-page letter to parishioners earlier this month, Mahony reiterated 
archdiocese assurances that none of the church's Latino ministries would be 
terminated and that a Sunday Spanish-language Mass would continue to be 
celebrated by a visiting priest. 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese has replaced Father Brian Cavanagh, who speaks some Spanish, 
and will have three Chinese-speaking priests at the church. In the letter, 
Mahony defended that decision, telling parishioners that outreach to the 
Chinese American community fulfilled "the call of Jesus Christ that we bring 
the 'Good News of Salvation' to every person. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, if we have failed to keep you informed and to keep you 
involved as fully as we should have, then that is my fault. . . . If anyone has 
felt hurt in any way by my lack of adequate information and involvement, then I 
hasten to apologize to you personally," Mahony wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the letter, parishioners said this week that they will continue 
fighting the "takeover." Parishioners, including some Chinese American members, 
want the archdiocese to provide a Spanish-speaking priest.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: KOREATOWN; COUNCIL OKS 
25-STORY OFFICE-HOTEL COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-story office-hotel that would serve as a gateway landmark to Koreatown 
received the tentative approval of the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Boosters of the proposed Pacific Trade Center also hope it will spur economic 
development in Koreatown, just as construction of the New Otani hotel 
stimulated the revival of Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 King Woods, a lobbyist for the developers, said the area is still in need of 
rebuilding after the 1992 riots. Supporters had to overcome the opposition of 
some lawmakers, who said the $150-million skyscraper does not belong in a 
neighborhood of homes and small businesses. Councilwoman Rita Walters also 
voiced concerns that Central American immigrants in Koreatown and African 
American residents of nearby Country Club Park would be shut out of the trade 
center.  
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the project 10 to 3. As designed, the Pacific Trade 
Center would have a 230-room hotel on its top floors, offices for trading 
companies in the lower floors of the tower, and restaurants, banks and stores 
at its base. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers say the project would create about 1,000 construction jobs and 
1,400 permanent jobs. The Pacific Trade Center would be at Olympic Boulevard 
and Western Avenue, near the site of a Korean grocery that served as the center 
of a fledgling Korean community in the 1970s.

CONTROVERSY FOLLOWS DWP CHIEF IN RETIREMENT; FINANCES: CITY OFFICIALS DENOUNCE 
DEAL ALLOWING DAN WATERS TO COLLECT $75,000 IN OVERTIME PAY. HE WAS EARLIER 
CRITICIZED OVER WATER RATES AND SPENDING DURING '93 STRIKE.

 Dan Waters thought retirement would put an end to the controversies that 
encircled him as general manager of the city Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he skis, travels and relaxes at home, Waters and the DWP are coming 
under fire for employing a method that allows him to cash in on 1,044 hours in 
compensatory time he accrued during his tenure at the city-owned utility. That 
translates to about $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle said Thursday that he will refuse to pay the 
$75,000 in overtime payments to Waters until the City Council reviews the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sham appointment should not stand, and this waste of public funds should 
not be allowed," said Tuttle, who frequently clashed with the DWP chief. "Dan 
Waters was generously compensated when he accepted the position of general 
manager, and his pension reflects that." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, who retired from the $165,000-a-year job in February, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day he retired, Waters was appointed assistant general manager, a job 
that carries no responsibilities but pays $72 an hour. Because general managers 
are not entitled to overtime, DWP officials said the voluntary demotion was the 
only way for Waters to collect on the comp time he had accrued before taking 
the agency's top post. 
</P>
<P>
 Water's voluntary demotion was approved by a Waters subordinate, assistant 
general manager Eldon Cotton, upon advice of the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The last general manager to retire, Norman E. Nichols, used the same 
post-retirement demotion in 1990 to receive $27,000 in overtime. The practice 
was questioned in a report released earlier this week by City Administrative 
Officer Keith Comrie that knocks the city's rising overtime costs. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP officials defend the practice as a fair way of compensating general 
managers for comp time they accrued before they took the DWP's top post. The 
practice may appear out of sorts, officials said, but it is part of an 
agreement between the DWP and the Management Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be hard to say he's doing anything improper or even 
tainted," said Dennis Tito, president of the DWP Board of Commissioners. "If 
there is a problem, it is the convoluted way things took place. It's the 
process you would question. It looks terrible, even sleazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs, a frequent DWP critic, condemned the practice as a 
"secret golden handshake" and said he will seek to close the "loophole" that 
allows DWP general managers to cash in upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 A temporary replacement for Waters, Kenneth S. Miyoshi, was named Wednesday, 
but the search for a permanent DWP chief continues. Tito said he hopes to 
reform the system so the next general manager has more clear-cut guidelines 
upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 For Waters, 59, the uproar is nothing new. A recent audit knocked Waters' 
leadership for spending abuses during last fall's employee strike, in 
particular high-priced catered meals for supervisors. Waters was also dragged 
into controversies over the restructuring of water rates and rationing 
implemented during the long drought.

A SCRAMBLE TO SCRUTINIZE '3 STRIKES' LAW; COURTS: PROSECUTORS AND DEFENSE 
ATTORNEYS LOOK FOR WAYS NEW MEASURE COULD BE CIRCUMVENTED. 
</P>

 Uncertainty about California's new "three strikes and you're out" law pervaded 
court deliberations in Los Angeles County on Thursday, with judges, prosecutors 
and defense attorneys in the country's busiest judicial system scurrying to 
make sense of its strict -- and sometimes confusing -- sentencing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Cecil Mills, supervisor for Los Angeles Superior Court, called on 
several top judges to determine if the already crowded court system can handle 
an expected surge in jury trials. Court officials are anticipating a flood of 
requests for such trials from convicted felons who previously might have 
accepted plea bargains but now face stiff mandatory sentences if found guilty 
under the new law. "The courts are already on the edge of collapse," said 
Acting Public Defender David Meyer, who added that the deluge of jury trials 
could force criminal cases into civil courtrooms or the hiring of additional 
judges. "Major systemic problems of this nature are only going to make it more 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the district attorney's office summoned a team of nine top 
prosecutors to analyze the new statute word by word and begin anticipating 
arguments that defense attorneys will make in efforts to circumvent its harsh 
sentencing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law that took effect Monday, anyone who has two prior convictions 
for serious or violent felonies and commits any felony on a third offense must 
be sentenced to a minimum of 25 years to life. The law also prescribes 
mandatory sentences for criminals who commit a second felony after having 
committed a prior serious or violent felony, as well as felons who had 
committed certain crimes as juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to stay ahead of the curve on this one," Assistant Dist. Atty. Dan 
Murphy said. "We expect that the longer defense lawyers have to look at this 
statute the more creative they will become in finding ways to attack it." 
</P>
<P>
 At least three new cases were filed by Los Angeles County prosecutors Thursday 
under the new law, including charges against a man who allegedly hit his mother 
in the head with a hammer, a 36-year-old man accused of stealing a car and 
trying to run over a pursuing officer, and a convicted robber who allegedly 
burglarized cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Public defenders and defense lawyers also began devising strategies for their 
clients, with most saying the statute's harsh penalties will force them to 
recommend against plea bargains. The overwhelming majority of cases in Los 
Angeles and around the country are resolved through plea arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would anyone plead guilty knowing they're facing 25 years to life?" asked 
Vincent James Oliver, a defense attorney. "At least you have a shot if you can 
get one juror on your side." 
</P>
<P>
 Questions also focused on confusion surrounding the new law's effect on death 
penalty and juvenile cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Deputy Public Defender Charles Gessler, who coordinates 
death penalty defenses, said ambiguous language in the new law can be 
interpreted as doing away with the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In juvenile cases, some attorneys worry that the new law will deny youngsters 
due-process rights because juveniles are not tried before a jury, but an 
offense may count as a "strike." Also, prosecutors said the law subjects 
juveniles to a harsher standard than adults because certain crimes committed by 
16- and 17-year-olds count as "strikes," but comparable offenses committed by 
adults do not.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: DOGFIGHT FOR GRUMMAN; THE RUSH TO DO DEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northrop Corp.'s stunning decision to launch a hostile bid for Grumman is 
another sign that many companies -- and not just defense companies -- believe 
the time to do strategic deals is now, investment bankers say. 
</P>
<P>
 That should translate into a pickup in hostile takeover offers overall this 
year, perhaps bringing back memories of the tremendous corporate battles of the 
late 1980s -- and providing a welcome new source of support for stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the reality is that few large hostile deals have succeeded recently, as 
QVC Network's recent failed bid for Paramount Communications vividly 
demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The major reason that hostility hasn't worked is the most obvious reason: A 
company that really doesn't want to be bought makes a poor partner, assuming 
that the deal is meant to be a true merger and not a bust-it-up, sell-it-off 
transaction like so many in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a lot of people meet their future spouses under difficult situations," 
one investment banker noted wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 The heyday for hostile deals was in 1988, the RJR Nabisco era, when such 
takeover offers totaled $210 billion and accounted for 62% of U.S. takeover 
bids, according to Securities Data Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the collapse of the junk bond market in 1989, the subsequent ruin of 
many corporate raiders and the bank credit squeeze that began in 1990, hostile 
takeovers became far more difficult to do. In 1992, the value of announced 
hostile offers was a mere $7.8 billion, or just 5% of all deals, Securities 
Data says. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, hostility revived as a takeover concept, pushing the value of 
announced hostile offers to $18.2 billion, or 7.5% of all bids. Much of that 
total, however, was accounted for by the ill-fated QVC offer for Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Why believe more buyers will go hostile this year? First, a pickup in 
unsolicited offers will be a function of more deals in general, friendly and 
hostile. With the U.S. economy on solid footing and corporate confidence 
soaring, many companies are eager to expand their businesses in significant 
ways, investment bankers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is going to be the year for intra-industry consolidation," says 
Dan Case, a principal at the investment banking firm Hambrecht & Quist in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes potential acquirers will be motivated in large part by investors' 
optimistic expectations for corporate profit growth, which are reflected in 
high stock prices. In an extremely competitive world economy, it's tough to 
produce the healthy earnings growth your shareholders expect without also 
increasing your market share meaningfully, Case says. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, hostile deals are easier to launch now because financing is 
once again plentiful. Major banks are in better fiscal shape than in many years 
and so are eager to lend money, as Northrop discovered: It apparently had no 
trouble lining up $2.8 billion in financing commitments from Chase Manhattan 
and Chemical Banking for the Grumman bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banks are willing to lend a bigger percentage of an acquisition price than 
they were even a year ago," says James Zukin, a principal at Century City-based 
Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, a firm that advises companies in takeover deals. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, raising money via high-yield junk bond offerings is again a snap 
for companies that choose to go that route. For example, Thrifty Drug Stores is 
using high-yield bonds to buy PayLess Drug Stores, a deal that might have been 
impossible just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks and junk bond investors are necessary parties to most hostile offers, 
because unsolicited offers need to be in cash -- not in the acquirer's stock -- 
to have a decent shot at succeeding, investment bankers note. 
</P>
<P>
 While it makes sense for friendly takeover deals to be done with stock swaps 
(especially if the buyer's stock is selling for a high price relative to 
earnings, making it a cheap currency for the buyer), the best way to lure an 
unwilling target's shareholders is with cold cash. 
</P>
<P>
 That may also be the only legal way to close a deal, especially if a hostile 
offer is made for a company that has already chosen another suitor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Paramount case, the Delaware court that heard QVC's challenge to 
Viacom's friendly takeover deal with Paramount made it clear that once a 
company puts itself up for sale, the directors' responsibility is to get the 
highest and best price. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Viacom was able to convince Paramount shareholders that its offer 
was best, but not before allowing QVC into the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
 With many companies angling to jump far ahead of their competitors in market 
share as the economy expands, friendly takeover offers are more likely to be 
followed by rival bids this year, bankers say. In effect, an offer for a 
competitor is a challenge to all other potential suitors in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 And with cash more readily available from banks and junk bond buyers, "it 
becomes tougher to defend that first deal out of the box," one investment 
banker says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this isn't likely to be 1988 all over again. Most deals are done for 
strategic reasons today -- a company seeking a fit with another, as both 
Northrop and Martin Marietta believe that Grumman's defense operations can be 
successfully integrated with their own, for shareholders' gain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '80s, in contrast, takeovers were led by raiders who simply sought 
to buy a business for $100, then sell its pieces for $150. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this takeover wave is finished, however, it's also possible that 
classic bust-up transactions will reappear, so long as the money to finance 
them remains available. 
</P>
<P>
 "History tells you that liquidity begets transactions," a banker reminds. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the defense sector, the strong cash flows enjoyed by many of the 
players, and the relative ease with which individual defense contracting units 
can be broken off, may make what's left of the industry particularly vulnerable 
to bust-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: General Dynamics has essentially chosen to go that route itself, 
selling off pieces of the company and distributing the proceeds to shareholders 
in cash dividends. Litton Industries decided last year to split itself, leaving 
defense operations in the old Litton and spinning off its oil field services 
and other commercial businesses in a new company, Western Atlas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the defense industry and many others, "There's a sense of urgency on the 
part of a lot of corporations to do something," one banker says. 
</P>
<P>
 And to a large degree, we may just be at that phase of the economic cycle 
where takeover mania is inevitable: As confidence returns to business, egos 
take over and corporate managers begin to believe that growth by eating others 
is their manifest destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, of course, it generally beats being eaten. Hostile Deals: A Tough Sell 
</P>
<P>
 Hostile takeover offers have been increasing in number, but the recent success 
rate for the largest ones hasn't been stellar. How the biggest hostile offers 
of the past year have fared: 03,18,19,18 Target Bidder Status Paramount QVC

SPECTRUM AND SCULLEY AGREE TO BURY THE HATCHET; DISPUTE: THE WIRELESS 
COMMUNICATIONS FIRM AND ITS FORMER CEO AGREE TO PUT ASIDE LAWSUITS AGAINST EACH 
OTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Sculley and Spectrum Information Technologies have agreed to drop the 
lawsuits they filed against one another after Sculley quit the company last 
month -- thus halting, at least temporarily, one of the most colorful public 
spats in the business world. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Spectrum nor Sculley would comment Thursday on the terms reached, but 
Heiko Thieme, president of the mutual fund that is Spectrum's largest 
shareholder, confirmed that the two parties had agreed to drop the suits 
without any money changing hands. Thieme described the agreement as a "first 
step" toward a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculley, the former chairman of Apple Computer Inc., became Spectrum's chief 
executive in October. He vowed to build the small, troubled wireless 
communications company into a powerhouse, but less than five months later he 
resigned and filed a $10-million fraud suit against Peter Caserta, Spectrum's 
president and former chairman, who had recruited him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculley claimed he had not been informed about problems at the company, among 
them a stock manipulation investigation being conducted by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. Spectrum quickly responded with a $300-million lawsuit of 
its own, accusing Sculley of an elaborate plot to exploit Spectrum's business 
opportunities for his own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectrum's stock price had fluctuated wildly even before Sculley joined, with 
Caserta and some promoters of Spectrum shares at times making what appeared to 
be extravagant claims about the value of wireless communications patents the 
company owns. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock leaped to more than $11 a share after Sculley's arrival and plunged 
to less than $3 on his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spectrum shares jumped 50 cents to close at $3.44 on Thursday in heavy Nasdaq 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculley, Caserta and the company still face problems. Sculley's reputation as 
a shrewd executive has been marred; Caserta reportedly is facing a grand jury 
investigation into the marketing of investment services by another company he 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectrum still must persuade key players in the wireless data industry to use 
its technology even as it deals with the management turmoil, financial woes and 
a number of lawsuits pressed by disgruntled shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 In a joint statement Thursday, Spectrum and Sculley said they had agreed to 
withdraw their lawsuits "without prejudice," meaning the suits could be refiled 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speculation created by the repetition of charges and counter-charges is not 
serving any useful purpose," their statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By withdrawing these suits, Spectrum's management can concentrate on 
developing its technology . . . and the individuals involved can get on with 
their careers," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thieme, who is president of the American Heritage Fund, said he played the 
unusual role of mediator in brokering the settlement. He applauded the 
agreement as good for shareholders, and said it could lead to a further 
accommodation of some kind between Sculley and the company, such as a 
consulting arrangement.

DOGFIGHT FOR GRUMMAN; NORTHROP'S KRESA DEFIES CAUTION IN HOSTILE BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The moral of this story may be: Don't get Kent Kresa mad. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa, the 55-year-old chairman and chief executive of Northrop Corp., is a 
studious-looking fellow who has cleaned up the Los Angeles-based aerospace 
giant's tarnished reputation and is generally regarded as bright, methodical 
and conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, Kresa defied expectations by making an unsolicited 
$60-a-share bid for Grumman Corp., which -- spurning an earlier, lesser offer 
from Northrop -- had signed a $55-a-share deal Monday with Martin Marietta 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kresa is a very cautious guy, and I think this startled a lot of people," 
said one Northrop watcher who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Wall Street analysts had widely predicted that Northrop and Kresa were 
not the type to take the risks inherent in a hostile takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kresa may not have had a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice before, merger attempts by Century City-based Northrop had been stymied. 
In the current "acquire or die" environment created by military budget cuts, 
analysts said, another failure would only weaken Northrop's chances of 
maintaining its independence. But standing pat would leave Northrop vulnerable 
to a takeover itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than wallow in that limbo, Kresa struck an uncharacteristically testy 
tone in the letter he sent Thursday to Grumman Chairman Renso L. Caporali 
complaining of ill treatment at the Long Island, N.Y., jet builder's hands. 
Grumman and Northrop had been in merger discussions for more than a year before 
Grumman rebuffed an offer of at least $50 a share last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been working to achieve a mutually acceptable business combination 
which corresponded as closely as possible to what we understood to be our 
shared strategic vision," Kresa wrote. "Now it appears from the tender-offer 
documents that we were not playing on a 'level playing field.' " Northrop, he 
complained, never knew that Grumman was also in talks with Martin Marietta. 
</P>
<P>
 Answering questions Thursday from reporters and financial analysts, Kresa 
stressed that Northrop is going after Grumman because of the perfect strategic 
fit of the two companies. In the past, he has stressed that he would not 
overpay for an acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't sought to acquire something just to get bigger or because others 
were buying," Kresa said. Instead, Northrop is looking to strengthen its 
military and commercial aircraft operations and its defense electronics 
businesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have recognized the need to consolidate," said John Harbison, head of 
the aerospace practice at Booz Allen & Hamilton. "They've been actively 
involved in pursuing transactions. . . . They just haven't won anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop recently has failed in attempts to buy IBM's Federal Systems division 
and General Dynamics' F-16 fighter jet line. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbison gives Kresa high marks for cleaning up Northrop's image, battered in 
defense department scandals, and for improving the firm's financial 
performance. "I think he's made some significant strides and the company has 
improved," Harbison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa has faced challenges before. Perhaps the greatest came four years ago, 
when he was selected to fill the shoes of controversial Northrop Chairman 
Thomas V. Jones. Jones' 27-year reign was highlighted by prosperity and risk 
taking but marred by allegations of fraud and bribery. 
</P>
<P>
 An engineer by training, Kresa has spent his entire 35-year career in 
aerospace and defense. He joined Northrop in 1975 as vice president and manager 
of the company's research and technology center and worked his way up. He now 
holds the jobs of president, chief executive and chairman. Profile: Kent Kresa

</P>
<P>
 Northrop's $60-a-share tender offer for Grumman beats the $55 offered by 
Martin Marietta, but it is far from the end of the story. Martin could come 
back with a higher bid, other companies could enter the fray and Grumman could 
end up officially auctioning itself. Corporate directors in such situations 
have an obligation to do what is best for the shareholders, which usually means 
taking the highest bid. But the question of what is best is subjective, which 
is why these fights often end up in court.

AMD CLEARED OF INFRINGING ON INTEL CHIPS; COURTS: THE JURY DECISION IS A 
PIVOTAL ONE FOR ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES. INTEL VOWS IT WILL APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Advanced Micro Devices Inc. won a pivotal victory Thursday in a long-running 
and closely watched case when a federal jury in San Jose cleared the computer 
chip maker of infringing Intel Corp. copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict means that AMD, a onetime Intel ally-turned-courtroom-belligerent, 
can continue selling its popular 486DX chips in competition with the industry 
leader. Analysts said the decision could boost AMD's fortunes by sweeping away 
a cloud that perhaps has restrained enthusiasm for the company's products. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big win for Advanced Micro Devices, but an even bigger win for 
computer users," an exultant Jerry Sanders, the Sunnyvale-based company's 
flamboyant chief executive, told reporters and investment analysts in a 
conference call. He added that AMD can now "be a contender for leadership" in 
the computer chip industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel, which controls 75% to 80% of the worldwide $8.8-billion microprocessor 
market, vowed to appeal the verdict. It is the second in the complex case. In 
1992, a jury found in Intel's favor, but the trial judge tossed out that 
decision, contending that Intel had inhibited AMD's defense by withholding 
certain documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now have two distinctly different jury verdicts," said F. Thomas Dunlap, 
vice president and general counsel of Intel, based in Santa Clara. "Therefore, 
the Court of Appeals must now decide which verdict stands." 
</P>
<P>
 For investors, the verdict was already in. Shares of AMD rocketed to $28.875, 
up $6.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. In Nasdaq trading, Intel's stock 
closed down $1.50 a share at $70.125 after having traded as low as $68.25. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine jurors weighing evidence in the seven-week trial unanimously rejected 
Intel's claim that AMD had infringed a copyright on the outmoded "287 math 
co-processor," a chip that speeds a computer's ability to crunch numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 They sided with AMD, which maintained that Intel had granted AMD the right to 
copy the 287's microcode in a 1976 cross-licensing agreement. (Microcode is 
software built into a chip that defines the sequence of steps required to 
execute each instruction.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, AMD was Intel's favorite backup manufacturing source for the 
chips. But in 1990, after AMD announced that it would produce its own math 
co-processor using Intel's microcode, Intel sued. 
</P>
<P>
 When AMD later used Intel microcode in making its lower-priced clones of the 
bigger rival's 386 and 486 chips, Intel again took AMD to court. Those 
proceedings are still under way. The Thursday verdict, analysts said, sets a 
precedent on microcode use that will aid AMD in those cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel, which has enjoyed huge profits with its near monopoly, faces a wave of 
competition from others as well as AMD, including Cyrix, Texas Instruments and 
Nexgen, which plans Monday to announce a new microprocessor in the same class 
as Intel's hot new Pentium. AMD has its own such chip, the K5. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict, Sanders said, means AMD can continue to ship 386 and 486 chips 
based on the Intel microcode. He projected that AMD will sell more than 900,000 
of the 486 chips this quarter, up from an earlier estimate of 700,000. They are 
used widely in desktop and portable computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders said AMD has spent a "horrendous" amount -- more than $100 million -- 
on the Intel legal battles. He referred often to "throwing out the olive 
branch" to Intel, saying it was time to get on with things and compete fairly.

employees, most of whom will be reassigned. California locations to be closed 
include two in San Bernardino and one each in Antioch, Chico, Folsom, 
Fairfield, Hemet, Hesperia, Moreno Valley, Oceanside, Palmdale, Rancho 
Cucamonga, Red Bluff, Rialto, Riverside, San Marcos, Temecula, Torrance,

 First-Time Jobless Claims Up: The Labor Department reported an increase of 
32,000 in the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits for the first 
time.The figure reversed much of the previous week's decline. The department 
said a seasonally adjusted 346,000 initial claims were filed during the week 
ended March 5. Analysts said they had expected the rise, since the previous 
week was shortened by a holiday. The increase reflected severe winter weather 
in the Northeast and Midwest, and probably lingering effects of January's 
earthquakes in Southern California.

 Regulators Offer Brochure on Investing: The Securities and Exchange 
Commission, stock exchanges, municipal securities regulators and state 
regulators announced the publication of a pamphlet with information designed to 
help consumers identify the decisions to be made before investing, select a 
broker and handle any problem that may arise. "There's no small print in it and 
the language is blunt," SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt told a Washington news 
conference. Among other things, the brochure advises consumers to steer clear 
of "guarantees" that they will not lose money on a particular transaction or 
claims that they can double their money in six months.

WHITEWATER RUMORS SINK BOND PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview  
</P>
<P>
 * Rumors about the Whitewater affair sent Treasury bond prices plunging in 
their biggest one-day drop of the last two years. Interest rates on 30-year 
bonds soared to nearly 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold prices jumped more than $8 an ounce as the dollar fell against other 
major currencies amid concern that the Clinton family real estate controversy 
could affect the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks were shaken too, pushing the market lower in active trading. The Dow 
industrials dropped 22.79 points to 3,830.62. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 A rash of rumors about the Whitewater affair triggered a worldwide selloff of 
Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors, later denied, eroded foreign and domestic investor confidence in 
the already-fragile market, intensifying a monthlong price plunge touched off 
by the Federal Reserve Board's hike in short-term interest rates Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond plummeted 1 11/16 points, or 
$16.88 per $1,000 in face value, the biggest one-day price plunge in at least 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.98% from 6.83% on 
Wednesday. Thursday's yield was the highest since May 28, when it was also 
6.98%. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, gold surged as some investors sought a safe haven. That, in turn, 
further pummeled bonds, because gold tends to gain on fears of rising 
inflation. Inflation undercuts the value of bonds and other investments that 
pay a fixed return. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all kind of scratching our heads," said Nick Kinas, a government bond 
trader at Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York. "You're having some turmoil in 
Washington at this point, and people are getting a little antsy." 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors behind much of the selling apparently stemmed from a newsletter by 
Johnson Smick, a Washington-based consulting firm, that raised questions about 
where Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster committed suicide. The 
newsletter, widely read among financial traders, suggested that Foster's body 
may have been moved from a Virginia apartment to the suburban Washington park 
where it was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster's death is among the issues to be examined by Robert B. Fiske Jr., the 
special counsel investigating the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 White House and police officials dismissed the Johnson Smick report and other 
rumors as ridiculous. But the damage to the markets was done. Currency/Gold  
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices shot up. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current 
delivery closed at $387.30 a troy ounce, up $8.10 from Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said gold, often considered a safe haven, rose as other U.S. 
financial markets slipped. The initial boost encouraged investment funds to buy 
still more gold, further driving up its price. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was hurt both by fears of political instability due to the 
Whitewater affair and by a slower-than-expected decline in German interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the German central bank cut money market rates by a tiny 0.03 of 
a percentage point. On Thursday, the Bundesbank president, Hans Tietmeyer, said 
it would continue to scrutinize growth in the German money supply, an indicator 
of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bundesbank is going to continue to be miserly with (short-term) rate 
cuts," said Angelo Evangelista, a vice president at Bank of Boston, referring 
to the Bundesbank's main tool for influencing money market rates. If German 
rates stay high, they will support a stronger mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, the dollar on Thursday dropped to its lowest level against the mark 
since Oct. 29, trading at 1.682 marks in New York, down from 1.706 on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also finished at 105.20 Japanese yen, down from 105.85 on 
Wednesday. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The market declined broadly as interest rates leaped, but prices finished well 
above their lows for the day. The Dow, down 22.79 points at the close, had been 
down about 40 points at midday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the stock market on pins and needles over possible further Fed moves on 
interest rates, it is highly vulnerable to rumors, including Clinton-related 
rumors, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while losing stocks topped winners 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, 
some experts were surprised that the damage wasn't far worse, given the surge 
in bond yields. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks lost just 1.02 points to 265.42. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Many financial stocks fell as interest rates rose. Citicorp dropped 3/4 to 
38 1/4, Federal National Mortgage gave up 3/4 to 81 1/4, Golden West lost 7/8 
to 37 7/8 and Countrywide Credit fell 1/2 to 24 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Utility stocks also led the market lower. American Electric Power fell 1/2 
to 33, SCEcorp eased 3/8 to 17, US West dropped 7/8 to 39 3/8 and BellSouth was 
off 7/8 at 54 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among industrials, paper and lumber stocks tumbled for a second day, in the 
wake of International Paper's warning that paper prices remain weak. IP slumped 
2 to 69 1/2, Georgia-Pacific dropped 1 3/8 to 68 5/8, Scott Paper shed 1 5/8 to 
44 1/2 and Weyerhaeuser lost 1 5/8 to 44 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the up side, gold stocks rose with the metal. ASA added 1 to 46 7/8, 
American Barrick gained 1 to 25 1/4, Placer Dome added 3/8 to 23 3/4 and Hemlo 
rose 1/2 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, London's FTSE-100 index fell 12.8 points to 3,233.9, while 
Frankfurt's DAX index gained 25.01 points to 2,141.10. In Mexico City, the 
Bolsa index slid again, losing 26.94 points to 2,506.14.

TOP EXECS VISIT A WORLD THAT'S ALIEN TO THEM; TECHNOLOGY: ORANGE COUNTY CRASH 
COURSE IS DESIGNED TO TEACH THEM TO USE PERSONAL COMPUTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It may come as no surprise that many chief executives of major corporations 
are computer illiterate. The higher up they are, the more embarrassing it can 
be to come out of the closet and seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was with gritted teeth that 31 CEOs came to a $5,500-per-person retreat 
in Orange County this week to admit their techno-phobia and learn to use 
gadgets ranging from personal computers to voice mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm borderline computer illiterate," said Russell E. Christiansen, chief 
executive of Midwest Resources Inc., an electric and gas utility in Des Moines, 
Iowa. "I thought I better get on with it. I can't be the last one in our 
organization to learn how to use a computer." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Christiansen, one of every three executives attending the seminar said 
they don't use computers at work or home, said Robert Burns, chief executive of 
the CEO Institutes, a training company that sponsors the seminars along with 
software publisher Computer Associates International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel was the third in a series of 
retreats the company has staged for chief executives from around the world. It 
is part of a crusade against the dangers of the "technology disconnect" between 
business people and the technology experts they increasingly depend on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to show that it isn't so complicated," said Charles Wang, chief 
executive of Computer Associates in Islandia, N.Y. "We're trying to take the 
intimidation out. We're also saying that if you want to use technology as a 
competitive advantage, you have to take the technology up into executive 
management." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel R. Nelson, chief executive of West One Bancorp, a regional bank based 
in Boise, Idaho, with $7.4 billion in assets, said he came to the seminar 
because he spends $2 million a year buying computer equipment he cannot fathom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of our largest expenditures and it has come to control our lives," 
he said. "I'm always terrified we're going down a blind alley. I've got to 
learn it or I'm going to get run over by it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the seminar, every chief executive is assigned a personal adviser in case 
he or she gets lost in the computer world. One by one, they joke with their 
fellow executives about how they had talked themselves into thinking you can't 
teach an old dog new tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald S. Freeman, president of Dallas-based Freeman Cos., a $250-million 
company with 1,500 employees that organizes trade shows, said he balked at 
manuals for computers that were thicker than the instruction books for the 
corporate planes he pilots. What's the use, he always reasoned. He could ride 
out his ignorance until he retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Others go to great lengths to hide their lack of knowledge. Carlos Tan, chief 
executive of Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. in San Diego, said he gets his secretary 
to print out his electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never asks her any questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm completely illiterate," he said. "For me, this is practical because we're 
about to invest some money in a new computer system."

 Turner Says He May Branch Into Movie Theaters: Cable operator Ted Turner said 
he hopes to invest in the movie theater business, but analysts expressed 
skepticism that partners Time Warner Inc. and Tele-Communications Inc., which 
own portions of Turner Broadcasting System Inc., would approve. Turner owns six 
movie theaters in the Atlanta area. He said he has committed about $500 million 
to movie production and marketing and plans to invest about $1 billion over the 
next few years.

 Amgen Inc., Amcell Corp. Announce Collaboration: The companies said they have 
agreed to develop and commercialize products based on proprietary cell 
separation and characterization technology developed in Germany.The agreement 
gives Amgen, the Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology giant, exclusive worldwide 
rights to develop and commercialize certain cell-separation products developed 
by Amcell of Los Altos. Amgen said it made an equity investment in Amcell, but 
neither company would disclose financial terms. Amcell will receive research 
and development funds as well as payments from Amgen. The companies said the 
technology may be instrumental in future treatments for cancer, AIDS and other 
diseases.

 Clinton to Allow Export of Satellite Technology: The Administration said it 
will allow U.S. companies to market sophisticated spy satellite technology to 
commercial customers worldwide. The policy revision, revealed last month in a 
plan put together by the Departments of Defense, State, Commerce and Energy, is 
the first major revision of the government's export controls in 15 years. 
Congress must approve the proposal, which has drawn criticism from some 
concerned about the spread of militarily sensitive technology.

 IBM's Akers Got $4 Million; Layoffs Announced: John Akers, the former IBM 
chairman and chief executive who resigned under pressure last year, received 
more than $4 million from the company, according to a new shareholder proxy 
statement. The money came in the form of salary, bonus, pension, stock options 
and a "retirement incentive" valued at $3.43 million.Akers was replaced by 
Louis V. Gerstner Jr. In a separate report, IBM said it has laid off workers 
from its large-scale computing division in New York. The company said last 
month that it would cut 1,200 jobs from that division as part of a plan to 
eliminate more than 30,000 positions this year. IBM said that about 800 
employees in the New York division locations had received notices.

 Disney World Heeds Minority Protests: The Orlando, Fla., theme park announced 
a program for hiring more minority contractors in response to complaints from 
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other groups. The SCLC then 
canceled the "Mickey Is a Rat" demonstration it had planned for Saturday at the 
park.The Rev. Roderick Zak of the SCLC said Walt Disney Co. has set a goal of 
15% minority participation by the year 2000 in business and construction 
related to Disney World. Judson Green, president of Walt Disney Attractions, 
said Disney will commit $1 million to helping new minority businesses get 
started, and a spokeswoman for Orange County, Fla., said the county will add $1 
million to its minority seed money and lending program.

 Progress Reported in Euro Disney Talks: Reports from Europe were that a 
debt-restructuring plan with European banks may include offering $1 billion in 
new shares for sale, as well as a waiver of royalties by Walt Disney Co., which 
operates the theme park outside of Paris. The lenders were also said to be 
considering lowering interest payments on Euro Disney's debt, which is about 
$3.5 billion. The London-based Financial Times reported that half the cost of 
the $2-billion restructuring would come from the securities sale and about a 
third would be realized from the reduced payments to banks and the waiver of 
royalties.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: SEARS AUTOMOTIVE TEST-DRIVES INCENTIVES 
</P>

<P>
 Sears, Roebuck & Co., as part of a 49-store test, is bringing back incentive 
pay for some auto center employees by offering bonuses linked to customer 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The company says the new incentives avoid the pitfalls of a program that was 
scrapped amid charges two years ago that Sears sold Californians unneeded auto 
parts and service. Investigators at the time blamed the abuse on sales quotas 
and pay incentives that rewarded employees for selling specific parts and 
service, such as installation of brake calipers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, auto center employees at test stores are being paid 
bonuses based on customer satisfaction. Upon leaving the auto centers, 
customers are asked to fill out and mail postcards rating the service they 
received. The results are tabulated at headquarters, and bonuses are 
distributed accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 At other Sears stores, mechanics are on salary and salespeople receive 
commissions of 2% to 3% on sales of batteries, tires and other parts. 
Salespeople no longer write repair orders, for which they received commissions 
before the costly 1992 auto repair scandal. Bad publicity cost Sears $700,000 a 
day in lost sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Baffico, president of Sears Automotive Group, said that to safeguard 
against possible abuse, the company is sending undercover employees to test 
stores to pose as customers seeking auto repairs.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure there is not any difference in selling than at a normal 
Sears store," Baffico said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Bureau of Automotive Repair, the state agency that uncovered 
sales abuses at Sears two years ago, said the retailer informed them in October 
of the test, which includes five of the 72 auto centers in California. Jim 
Schonig, chief of the bureau, said Sears has significantly reformed its repair 
operations in California and that he has no objections to the incentive 
program.

 Ask a question, get 47 options: The Internal Revenue Service came under fire 
in Congress this week for apparent shortcomings in how it assists taxpayers 
with their returns. 
</P>
<P>
 A General Accounting Office study found that last year only 24% of calls to 
the IRS toll-free assistance line went through during the Jan. 2-April 24 tax 
filing season. In 1989, 58% of the calls went though. The GAO said people 
either received busy signals or hung up before an agent came on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS told the House Government Operations subcommittee on commerce, 
consumer and monetary affairs that despite a tight budget, it has installed 
additional phone equipment and extended office hours this tax season to improve 
its performance. Curious, we called the IRS' help line ((800) TAX-1040) to 
check out the service. 
</P>
<P>
 We got a busy signal on three out of four tries. When we did get through, we 
entered a labyrinth of voice mail, spending 10 minutes listening to recorded 
messages and selecting options before we got help. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, a recorded greeting asked us to choose from among seven options. We 
punched 4 on a touch-tone phone for help with individual tax filings. A second 
recorded message asked us to choose from among nine options. We punched 1 to 
hear a prerecorded tape on a tax topic. A third recording then offered us 18 
options. We punched 300 for general information. A fourth recorded message gave 
us 13 more options. We had reached the end. 
</P>
<P>
 That answered our question.

 Credit growth: In yet another sign that the national economy is improving, 
credit card receivables grew 15.8% in 1993, the biggest spurt in three years, a 
report out this week says. 
</P>
<P>
 Receivables are what consumers owe credit card issuers. A growth in 
receivables reflects a willingness on the part of consumers to take on debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth wasn't spread evenly across the country. The report said that 
receivables fell 7% at both Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, indicating 
that Californians remained reluctant about credit card spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The report from Frederick, Md.-based RAM Research also indicated that some of 
the nation's largest banks have lost market share to aggressive non-bank card 
issuers, such as AT&T Universal Services, GM Card issuer Household Credit 
Services, and MBNA, a big issuer of affinity cards to members of specific 
groups such as unions or professional organizations. Citibank and Discover 
Card, a non-bank card, remained the two largest credit card issuers in 1993, 
while MBNA moved up to third place, shoving aside Chase Manhattan. Bank of 
America, Wells Fargo and NationsBank also slid in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 RAM Research President Robert B. McKinley said non-banks are gaining because 
they spend aggressively to promote their cards and are more innovative than 
many of their banking competitors. Household Credit, with its GM Card, was the 
first to allow consumers to earn rebates on a new car. AT&T was the first to 
entice customers by offering no-fee-for-life to people who transferred balances 
from competing cards. "The banks haven't lost the game, but they need to get 
more aggressive," McKinley said.

fragrances, known for their steamy advertising images, will soon include a 
unisex perfume, according to Women's Wear Daily.

 After being excluded from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last 
year, Hollywood may have finally found a sympathetic ear within the 
protectionist-minded French government. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Miyet, a former French consul general in Los Angeles with friends in 
high places in Hollywood, has emerged as a key figure in discussions over the 
industry's access to European markets. He quietly met with the American Film 
Marketing Assn. in Los Angeles last week, then traveled to Washington on 
Wednesday for follow-up talks with Motion Picture Assn. of America President 
Jack Valenti. 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups said Miyet came off as a conciliator who favors a more open 
discussion between Hollywood and the European Union, formerly known as the 
European Community. "He said that it's time to put the antagonism behind us and 
see if we can find some way into the future that all sides find agreeable," 
Valenti said Thursday when asked about the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 While Miyet has no formal role in the French government, he's known as a close 
associate of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, for whom he served as a special 
emissary during the GATT discussions. As a consul general based in Los Angeles 
until 1989, Miyet also got to know his share of moguls. Valenti called Miyet, 
who speaks fluent English, an "old friend." 
</P>
<P>
 While Valenti cautioned that it's too soon to say what will come of the talks, 
he added that Miyet "clearly has the ear of important people" in Europe. "I 
don't know whether he's coming under instructions or not, but he is certainly 
well regarded there," Valenti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood has been grappling with its future in Europe since December, when it 
was excluded from the GATT agreement at the 11th hour. The French are the 
strongest advocates for increasing quotas and fees on Hollywood films and TV 
shows, but exhibitors and filmmakers in other European countries have also 
taken up the battle cry. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, European Union audiovisual commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro 
turned up the heat another notch by calling for the dismantling of United 
International Pictures, a major distributor of Hollywood films overseas. 
Pinheiro later said he was open to discussing the issue further. Meanwhile, his 
group is working to complete a set of broader policy recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 If those recommendations are too Draconian, one executive suggested Thursday, 
Hollywood could retaliate by boycotting the Cannes Film Festival in May. While 
Cannes caters to the worldwide film community, Hollywood has traditionally 
provided its glitz and cachet. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how radical the sanctions appear to be, however, most industry 
sources consider any type of formal boycott unlikely, because Hollywood derives 
considerable benefit from the international exposure Cannes offers. No studio 
has made a major commitment to the festival yet, but stay tuned. Organizers 
next month will announce who's participating. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about a Range Rover, a window seat at Locanda Veneta or a cellular 
telephone with call waiting. The latest status symbol in Hollywood is a meeting 
with Sumner Redstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors had the incoming Paramount Communications leader in talks with everyone 
short of Elvis during his victory tour of Los Angeles this week, which included 
a stopover in Las Vegas for the NATO/Showest convention. While much of what 
went on was ceremonial, sources say Redstone also conducted some actual 
business during his mad dash through the corridors of power. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, he lunched with MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman and President 
Sidney J. Sheinberg. The wide-ranging discussion is said to have touched on 
everything from Redstone's new role in Hollywood to the disposition of the USA 
Network, the valuable cable network that is co-owned by Paramount and MCA and 
which may now be bought by one or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who met with Redstone, and/or his chief executive, Frank Biondi, over 
the course of the week reportedly included Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael Ovitz, MGM/UA Chairman 
Frank Mancuso, International Creative Management Chairman Jeff Berg, Castle 
Rock Entertainment Chairman Alan Horn and Jonathan Dolgen, president of Sony 
Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Redstone and Biondi repeatedly stressed their support for 
Paramount Pictures Chief Sherry Lansing during the meetings. At the same time, 
the two said they still intend to hire a business executive to oversee film and 
TV operations at the studio. That job was previously handled by Stanley Jaffe, 
the outgoing Paramount Communications president. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those casually mentioned for the post: Dolgen, HBO Chief Michael Fuchs, 
CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky and Time Warner International 
executive Arthur R. Barron. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Katzenberg, he wins the man of the people award of the week for 
flying coach on Southwest Airlines to the NATO/Showest convention Tuesday. 
Katzenberg turned a lot of heads when he ambled onto the $30 one-way flight 
from Burbank to Las Vegas. The Disney chief was there for the studio's live 
stage show and tent party, which attracted roughly 4,000 people and created a 
lot of positive buzz for Disney's upcoming animated feature, "The Lion King."

 Paramount: Viacom Inc. said Thursday that it has received the $1.25-billion 
infusion it needs from video rental giant Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. to 
take control of Paramount Communications Inc. Blockbuster, which will 
ultimately be acquired by Viacom as part of the three-way merger, receives 23 
million shares of Viacom's Class B common stock for its money.An agreement by 
the Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based company to put its money into the deal played a 
key role in enabling Viacom to defeat a rival bid for Paramount by home 
shopping channel QVC Network Inc. Blockbuster shareholders are expected to vote 
next month or in May on the company's acquisition by Viacom.

PLAYING THE OSCAR GAME LIKE A 'PIANO'?; MOVIES: DESPITE THE CLAMOR, SOME ARGUE 
THAT 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' MAY NOT BE A SHOO-IN AT THE ACADEMY AWARDS. MIRAMAX UPS 
THE ANTE WITH A HUGE AD CAMPAIGN FOR ITS UNDERDOG.

 In the 1976 Oscar race, the buzz focused on what appeared to be the two 
leading contenders for best motion picture, "Network" and "All the President's 
Men." But the Oscar went to "Rocky." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, the talk was high on "Reds" and "On Golden Pond." But the Oscar went 
to "Chariots of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 These are the kinds of tales that keep Academy Awards shows quirky and 
surprising. They are what keeps anyone, with any sense of history, from saying 
that any anticipated award is a "sure thing." 
</P>
<P>
 They are also what keeps hopes alive for the four best picture nominees in a 
year that seems dominated by the fifth nominee, "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep hearing that 'Chariots of Fire' music," said an optimistic Harvey 
Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax Films, the distributor of the best 
picture-nominated "The Piano." Also in contention are "The Fugitive," "In the 
Name of the Father" and "The Remains of the Day." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, however, it has been a campaign on behalf of "The Piano" that 
has drawn the most attention because it has been the most aggressive. The 
Miramax people learned how to put on a campaign when they brought the unlikely 
"The Crying Game" into Oscar prominence a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein knows that "Schindler's List" is the film most people consider the 
odds-on favorite to win. It has all the historic precedents going for it and 
director Steven Spielberg won the Directors Guild of America prize, which, in 
the history of the movie awards, is tantamount to winning the Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weinstein contends there is no sure thing. "Look, you have to keep it 
interesting. No one wants to be told by the media that the whole thing is 
wrapped up," he said. And, of course, short of winning the Oscar, Miramax also 
clearly hopes to help boost ticket sales as well as its prestige with the 
cerebral art-house film. 
</P>
<P>
 So he and his partner, brother Robert Weinstein, have engineered an amazing -- 
and some say amazingly overblown -- ad campaign in the Hollywood trade 
newspapers, the mailing of an elegant booklet on the movie printed on expensive 
parchment and some heavy advertising in general. Full-page ads that boast the 
achievement of women in the making of "The Piano" have numbered as many as 
seven per day in Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. They are 
congratulatory in tone, with director Jane Campion, for instance, singing the 
praises of the film's Oscar-nominated star, Holly Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer volume of the ads, especially for such a modest and relatively 
inexpensive film, has raised eyebrows, even among some veteran Oscar observers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Weinstein claims the cost of the campaign is $250,000. "Our ads 
are black and white. They don't cost as much." On the other hand, he noted that 
ads for Universal Picture's "Schindler's List" and that studio's other best 
picture nominee, "In the Name of the Father," used color and cost more.  
</P>
<P>
 But off the record, some individuals involved with placing Oscar advertising 
say that Weinstein is understating the cost. One estimate for the cost of the 
ads runs as high as $750,000. "It cost almost as much as the movie did to 
make," was the sarcastic comment of one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad the campaign has been so effective that it seems like we're spending 
more than we did," was Weinstein's reaction. "I'll bet we spent 50% of what the 
other studios spent." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more unusual aspects of "The Piano" campaign has been the emphasis 
on the achievements of women. The film has garnered nominations for women in 
seven categories. Among those is a best director nomination for Campion, only 
the second woman ever to be nominated for best director. The first was Lina 
Wertmuller for 1976's "Seven Beauties." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly a women's achievement," Weinstein said. But taking that 
advertising line with the academy, whose membership is only about 15% to 20% 
female, is risky, he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we're just trying to say, hey, we're here. That the race isn't 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein's contention that the race isn't over was, in part, supported by a 
theory put forth recently by Hollywood Reporter columnist Martin Grove. It was 
Grove's thinking that in years when there are two strong films, it paves the 
way for a third film to win.  
</P>
<P>
 But Grove's theory wouldn't necessarily warm Weinstein's heart: "Schindler's 
List" is the strong film in terms of Oscar votes, and "In the Name of the 
Father" is gaining in support, Grove said. But Grove's thinking is that this 
rivalry might even pave the way for "The Fugitive" to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a plurality of votes is needed in the five-way race and no one but the 
accountants working for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ever 
knows the tallies. This year the Oscar ballots are due at the accountants on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Irwin Winkler, who with former partner Robert Chartoff, has been on 
both the winning side ("Rocky") and the "sure thing" side that loses ("The 
Right Stuff"), knows full well the unpredictability of the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The night that 'The Right Stuff' was up for best picture, we won four Oscars 
in a row (for other categories). So I thought we're gonna win." But the winner 
for 1983 turned out to be "Terms of Endearment." 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't think 'Rocky,' with a story about a fighter who was a 
million-to-one shot, would win. But it did," Winkler said. "Very often the 
academy votes with their heart. They loved that theme of 'Rocky,' that if you 
believe in your heart, you can win."

FROM THE HEARTLAND TO THE HOOPLA; SHOWEST TURNS ON THE GLITTER FOR MOM-AND-POP 
EXHIBITORS 
</P>

<P>
 NATO/ShoWest is a place where Hollywood really turns it on for the theater 
owners from America's heartland. And, boy, do they love it. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing Jerry Hancock and his wife, Pinkie, did when they got here 
from Livingston, Mont., was borrow an automatic camera from a relative. They 
had forgotten to bring theirs and didn't want to miss out on taking snapshots 
of their favorite movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this is the one shot a year that this couple, who typify many 
ma-and-pa theater owners who come to this annual convention, gets to be so 
close to the glitter and glamour of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it here. I love and admire the stars and it's interesting to be close 
to these people you see on the big screen," says Hancock, a former coal miner 
who became an exhibitor three years ago, at age 50, when he and Pinkie bought a 
1938 twin theater in Livingston that had fallen into disrepair. They spent 
$50,000 updating the theater, which revived its sluggish business into a 
profitable operation. The Hancocks drove 12 hours to get here last week from 
their hometown, where they live in an apartment right above their Empire Twin 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work seven days a week, sometimes 16 hours a day, and this is our only 
getaway," says Hancock. These are folks who aren't too proud to pop their own 
corn, tear tickets, run the concession stand, operate the projector, clean 
restrooms, or drive 30 miles to pick up film cans at the nearest airport. 
Pinkie Hancock, who quit her job as a payroll clerk at a construction company 
after her brother Tim Warner, general chairman of NATO/ShoWest, convinced her 
and her husband to buy a theater, is excitedly pacing the aisles of the 
convention's trade show here at Bally's Hotel and Casino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always come and take all kinds of stuff," she says, showing off a bagful of 
freebies she's collected from the vendors hawking their latest concession 
goodies and every other imaginable theater-related item from carpet cleaners to 
popcorn bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkie Hancock reaches into her bag like a child who just scored big on 
Halloween, proudly holding up a box of Amazing Fruit Gummy Bears, Magic Malts 
and Swedish fish soft candy. "Look at these big pretzels. I'd like to sell them 
too . . . and, oh, I'm very excited about this (bottled) water." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her brother, Warner, the convention's headmaster, the scenes to 
make sure everything will go off like clockwork, iplanned by major studios, 
complete with stars. In a Wednesday mo186898186517181866111113940340stage so he 
can get the best pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I had my picture taken with Brad Pitt, but I buried it because I 
looked like the Bride of Dracula," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The camera lens is the closest any of these exhibitors will get to the ShoWest 
stars, who are kept under tight wraps from the moment they step from the jets 
that bring them here to the moment they leave Vegas. Even the press is barred 
from the Bally's ballroom "green room," the holding tank where the stars wait 
until the lunch starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, in preparation for their big dinner event, Paramount would 
sequester its stars, who included ShoWest "star of the century" Harrison Ford, 
Tom Hanks, Eddie Murphy, Joe Pesci, Melanie Griffith, Ted Danson, Mary 
Steenburgen and George Lucas, in the hotel penthouse suite before sneaking them 
in to the green room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so happy to get to see Warren Beatty and Michael Douglas and Jodie 
Foster and Demi Moore," says Pinkie Hancock, who like her husband was also 
wowed by the clips of upcoming movies from Warners and Paramount that they hope 
to book this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like the family-oriented movies because they play best in our market," 
says Hancock, citing the favorites he saw here, which included "Black Beauty," 
"Richie Rich," "Lassie," "Maverick," "Wyatt Earp," the next installment of 
"Star Trek," "Naked Gun 33 1/3" and the new Tom Hanks film, "Forrest Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hancocks say they play some more upscale adult pictures like "The Piano," 
"Shadowlands" and "The Remains of the Day," but he limits the number of R-rated 
movies "because they just don't do as well in our small town." Even Clint 
Eastwood's "Unforgiven" "didn't do as well as we had hoped," Hancock says. 
</P>
<P>
 But generally, "whatever's doing well at the box office is what we try to 
play," he says. His most-popular films in the last year included "Mrs. 
Doubtfire," "Grumpy Old Men," "A River Runs Through It" (which was filmed in 
Livingston) and, of course, "Jurassic Park." They are currently showing "My 
Girl 2" and "The Getaway," neither doing particularly well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Empire theater is the only movie house in Livingston (population 6,000), 
and is, its owners say, profitable. They offer two shows a night (7 and 9:15), 
kiddie matinees on Saturday and regular matinees on Sunday. "Did Jerry tell you 
about all the stars that live in our area and who are regulars?" asks Pinkie 
Hancock, ticking off the names of Michael Keaton, Jeff Bridges, Peter Fonda, 
Whoopi Goldberg, Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan -- before the reporter has a chance 
to say he already had.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: KINNEAR'S 'LATER': A COMEDY SOUP; TELEVISION: THE HOST IS 
SMIRKY, SELF-DEPRECATING AND SOMETIMES QUITE FUNNY -- A GOOD FIT FOR THE 
ANYTHING-GOES AMBIENCE OF THE TALK SHOW.

 It was late Wednesday (or early Thursday, if you prefer) on NBC's "Later With 
Greg Kinnear," the half-hour series that succeeded "Later With Bob Costas" two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinnear's guest was Ben Stiller, the now-famous young director and co-star of 
"Reality Bites." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinnear asked: "Now, everybody's saying, I know you must hate the burden of 
this, that this is some sort of movie that speaks to this Generation X. 
Generation gap. What are you? Are you comfortable? You can't be. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Stiller replied: "No, I don't know. I, y'know, it's like, I'm such a 
non-expert on that, and the whole, I don't know, just, y'know, X Generation, 
y'know, it's just a term that's like. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Like, y'know, Stiller is a superb farceur, witness his 1992-93 Fox series, 
"The Ben Stiller Show," whose brief but streaky-brilliant 12-episode life was 
sufficient to earn an Emmy Award for writing. But no, he wasn't satirizing 
Marlon Brando in "The Wild One." He was actually attempting to answer a 
question. A quasi-question. Almost a question. Actually, not much of a 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 All right, the level of discourse on this Monday-through-Thursday show will 
never compete with Mortimer Adler's "Six Great Ideas." And Greg Kinnear is no 
Bob Costas, who, despite being known as a sports specialist, was an interviewer 
for all seasons who operated a half-hour of chat that ranged from breezy to 
subtle and sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Costas' New York show was an intimate klatch that was taped 
without the intrusiveness of a studio audience. Kinnear's comedy-heavy Burbank 
show has a studio audience of hooters who appear to have come by because they 
couldn't pass the I.Q. test to get into "The Arsenio Hall Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another revelation, though: Bob Costas is no Greg Kinnear. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinnear is essentially a performer. He has better stand-up skills (and better 
hair days) than Conan O'Brien. He's smart-ass smirky, caustic, self-deprecating 
and sometimes quite funny -- all in all, a good fit for the anything-goes 
ambience of 1:35-2:05 a.m. As he's fond of saying: "It's 2 o'clock in the 
morning. You can do these things. They don't have to mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, they don't. "Later With Greg Kinnear" wears its irrelevance 
like a chest full of medals. 
</P>
<P>
 The show sometimes starts with a comedy bit in the guest's dressing room. On 
one episode last week, for example, you had George Carlin getting bleeped every 
time he mentions a four-letter word he wants to say on the air. Kinnear: "Hmmm. 
No, look, you stay away from those seven words, George, you'll do just fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes the "Videologue," with Kinnear reacting to goofy news clips with 
the same biting ridicule that he applies to the daytime talk-show clips on 
"Talk Soup," the show he hosts on cable's E! Entertainment network. 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes the guest (most have been comics so far), some warm-up questions, 
the obligatory clip of the guest's work, some more interview and then whatever 
happens . . . happens. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of it isn't pretty, ranging from sophomoric to plain awful. In that 
category was a scene from "The Bodyguard," with Kinnear reading Whitney 
Houston's lines and Martin Short (probably wishing he hadn't shown up) doing 
Kevin Costner's.  
</P>
<P>
 On the same banal level is a regular feature known as "Later Letter," with 
Kinnear reading a message to the present guest from the previous night's guest. 
Phil Hartman to Carlin: "What's your advice to aspiring stand-up comedians?" 
Carlin: "Do the jokes in front of an audience." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Short was funny even when hopelessly sinking; Kinnear and 
Marilu Henner turned out to be an infectiously free-wheeling pair; Stiller was 
refreshingly natural and unpretentious, and Carlin turned out to be one of 
those rare comedians who actually can be interviewed.  
</P>
<P>
 Kinnear wondered about Carlin's Catholic background. "Did the nuns leave any 
permanent impression on you?" he asked. "Oh, boy, all over," Carlin replied. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether "Later With Greg Kinnear" leaves much of an 
impression. Well, nothing permanent. Its impact is glancing. No one will risk 
oversleeping the next morning just to see Kinnear raise an eyebrow at some 
silliness or to hear Henner reminisce about "Taxi" or to hear Stiller say, 
"Generation shmeX, Y, Z, I don't know." You don't stay up late for this show. 
You watch it because you're already there at 2 in the morning, it's there, and 
why not? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ONE MORE TIME. Tuning in once more to Kinnear's older 12:35-1:35 a.m. lead-in, 
"Late Night With Conan O'Brien," you discover that there's no reason to tune 
in. You learned from Wednesday's show that O'Brien is on the same treadmill 
after six months. 
</P>
<P>
 He's still likable, but his rhythms are all wrong. He still can't deliver a 
monologue or interview with authority, and he still can't rescue unfunny 
material. Unlike his predecessor, David Letterman, he cannot create gold from 
dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress-model Kathy Ireland showed up to plug her swimwear line ("These suits 
are great") and "NBC Dateline" correspondent Stone Phillips talked at length 
about the previous night's show that featured his interview with serial 
murderer Jeffrey Dahmer and Dahmer's father. Phillips mentioned the "general 
lesson" that viewers of the interview were supposed to have come away with, but 
was unclear about what that lesson was. Abundantly clear was that the stench of 
tabloid was now smelling up even benign "Late Night With Conan O'Brien." 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy portion of the hour ended with some unevenly funny nonsense about 
two elderly spies duking it out. It was promising, but like much else on the 
show, it didn't quite work. "I think we've seen enough," O'Brien said. Yes.

STREISAND PLANS SOME 20 SHOWS IN U.S., CANADA; POP MUSIC: AFTER HER LONDON 
CONCERTS NEXT MONTH, THE SINGER IS SET TO TOUR -- PROBABLY INCLUDING AN L.A. 
APPEARANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand's much anticipated concert tour will begin next month with at 
least two shows in London, but the rest of the tour itinerary is still being 
formalized, her representative Marty Erlichman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 What appears probable is that the tour will return to North America after 
London for approximately 20 shows divided between five to eight U.S. and, 
possibly, Canadian cities -- not the 12 cities previously expected. Since the 
shows will all be in arenas seating approximately 15,000, that means 
approximately 300,000 available tickets for the North American swing. 
</P>
<P>
 While Erlichman wants to avoid naming the remaining cities until all contract 
details have been finalized, sources said dates in New York, probably at 
Madison Square Garden, and Los Angeles, probably at either the Forum in 
Inglewood or the Anaheim Arena, are scheduled. Dates, however, remain 
tentative. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour will start in London because the timing coincides with plans by the 
Boots pharmacy chain to contribute 1 million in Streisand's name to the Variety 
Clubs of Great Britain. The money will be used to purchase 32 specially 
equipped "Sunshine" coaches for use by disabled children in England and 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 The format of the shows will be the same as the one in Las Vegas. Rather than 
a "greatest hits" run-through, the production was scripted along the 
autobiographical lines of a one-woman Broadway show. She employed music and 
stories to reflect on such matters as childhood dreams, relationships, family 
ties and social responsibilities. Marvin Hamlisch will again conduct a 64-piece 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The shows follow Streisand's triumphant return to live concerts after a 
22-year break with highly acclaimed performances Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 at the MGM 
Grand Hotel's 13,000-seat Grand Garden arena in Las Vegas. The dates grossed an 
estimated $7 million each, which is more than twice any previous pop music 
gross, including rock stadium dates that sometimes attract up to 90,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the upcoming tour, however, will be priced considerably below the 
Vegas shows, which averaged more than $600 per seat. Tickets for the London 
shows April 20 and 27 will go on sale today. 
</P>
<P>
 Erlichman said he felt optimistic that Streisand would agree to do additional 
shows after the excitement of the Las Vegas dates, but that she didn't give the 
official go-ahead for almost two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was going to be a short tour because Barbra has some films she 
wants to do as soon as possible, which meant we were working within a narrow 
time frame in putting the tour together," he said. "I think she really enjoyed 
the experience, but she is also committed to the films. 
</P>
<P>
 "If her next film ("The Normal Heart") was ready to go, my instinct was she 
probably would have done it right away, but that film probably won't be ready 
to start pre-production until some time this summer, so that was our deadline." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Streisand cut back so greatly on plans to tape the MGM Grand 
performances for a TV special that it initially appeared the special would have 
to be scrapped, she was "delighted" with the footage captured by the reduced 
number of cameras -- and that footage will be the basis of a future show, 
Erlichman said. No arrangements for the special, however, have been made.

SCREEN'S MERCURIAL GIRL IS AT IT AGAIN; MOVIES: JENNIFER JASON LEIGH ENTERS THE 
FANTASTIC BURLESQUE OF '30S SCREWBALL COMEDIES IN 'HUDSUCKER PROXY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jennifer Jason Leigh loves to smoke. But she doesn't smoke. But she's smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm about to play a chain-smoker," the actress explains, nestled in a sofa in 
a Park Avenue hotel room. "So why stop and begin again?" 
</P>
<P>
 Why indeed? Why even ask? When you take into consideration that Leigh, 32, one 
of the most convincing and certainly the most chameleonic of film actresses, is 
so umbilically linked to the characters she plays, one should assume the smoke 
signals an upcoming role. Or two. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll soon begin shooting Taylor Hackford's tentatively titled "Dolores 
Claiborne," in which she's Kathy Bates' chain-smoking, pill-addicted journalist 
daughter. And she's just finished playing the sad and acerbic Dorothy Parker, 
another heavy smoker, in Alan Rudolph's upcoming film biography, "Mrs. Parker." 
The ghost of the Algonquin may also explain the tightly coiffed hair, and 
tightly wound presence Leigh exudes on this particular Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh admits that yes, she does get "heavily involved" in the roles she plays. 
She lost weight to play an anorexic in "The Best Little Girl in the World," 
gained weight to play a bloated prostitute in "Last Exit to Brooklyn," lost 
sleep to play a jumpy junkie cop in "Rush" and lost herself in research for 
every other role. Her dedication to her art, in fact, is her most identifying 
characteristic. Otherwise, she tends to disappear into each fictional person 
she portrays. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, she has no tidy Hollywood image. And perhaps as a result, she hasn't 
had any really big hits, even though virtually all her performances -- even in 
otherwise forgettable movies like "Backdraft," where she makes love to William 
Baldwin on top of a fire engine, or "Single White Female," in which she played 
Bridget Fonda's lethal roommate -- have garnered critical praise. Her 
contribution to Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" -- a slatternly housewife who 
dispenses phone sex to pay bills -- proves she can do just about anything. And 
has, in the course of playing a variety of what one writer called "sluts and 
nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 But even under her brittle Parker-inspired demeanor and unyielding cosmetics 
-- which conceal what Harper's Bazaar proclaimed in 1992 as one of its top 10 
beauties -- there's a sweetness that resurfaces, either when saying goodby to a 
camera crew that's leaving her hotel suite, or reminiscing about her girlhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got stomach flu a lot," says Leigh, daughter of the late actor Vic Morrow, 
and the screenwriter Barbara Turner. "So I got to stay home from school, which 
I loved 'cause I got to sleep in my mom's bed, have meals in bed and it was 
great! Because I got to watch old movies on TV. What could be better? I grew up 
loving those movies, but I never thought I'd have a chance to play in one. And 
then this script came." 
</P>
<P>
 This script was "The Hudsucker Proxy," a fantastic burlesque of '30s screwball 
comedies by the other-worldly team of Joel and Ethan Coen ("Raising Arizona," 
"Miller's Crossing," "Barton Fink"). The film, which opens today, is set in the 
'50s, co-stars Tim Robbins and Paul Newman and although it's the most 
accessible film they've done to date, bears the unmistakable Coen brothers 
imprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Leigh's penchant for character absorption and the fact she completed 
"Hudsucker" a year ago, by interview time there aren't too many traces -- 
outside of Leigh's actual, diminutive physical presence -- of Amy Archer, the 
smart, caustic, machine-gun-mouthed reporter who's the centerpiece of 
"Hudsucker." Leigh has done comedy before, but Archer's a departure, the kind 
of female character who hasn't been seen on screen since Katharine Hepburn and 
"Woman of the Year." 
</P>
<P>
 "She just came in and blew us away," said producer Joel Silver (the "Die 
Hards" and "Lethal Weapons"), for whom "Hudsucker" is also something of a 
departure. "She came in with this full-blown characterization, and who would 
have dreamed? All I can say is I'm happy she did." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, her co-star, had to read for his role in "Hudsucker" too, he said, 
and once he was cast he started reading with all the other "potential Amys." 
</P>
<P>
 "But Jennifer came in like gangbusters," Robbins said. "The character was 
already there." 
</P>
<P>
 Once casting was complete, he said, there was a solid two weeks of rehearsal. 
"We had to work off each other, develop a common vocabulary." And, he said, 
Leigh came to the set with no "baggage." "Some people, you expect attitude, 
self-indulgence. Jennifer's incredibly professional." 
</P>
<P>
 And adventurous, like everyone else involved with "Hudsucker." Maybe it's a 
testament to the filmmakers, but the movie is rife with incongruities: pop 
maestro Silver, producing for the alternative Coens; the noble Paul Newman, 
playing a version of Snidely Whiplash; Robbins, in his goofiest role since Nuke 
Laloosh in "Bull Durham." And Leigh, the pinup girl for modern anxiety, doing 
the retro boogie. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Amy) is very reminiscent of all those 1930s and '40s heroines in the 
screwball Capra movies and Preston Sturges movies, Howard Hawks, Cukor," Leigh 
said. "It's not just Hepburn though. I'm doing everybody. Amy Archer is like 
all those characters rolled up into one: 'Meet John Doe,' 'Mr. Smith Goes to 
Washington,' 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,' 'The Lady Eve,' 'Philadelphia Story,' 
'Woman of the Year,' 'Holiday,' 'His Girl Friday' . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's this last film, the Cary Grant-Roz Russell remake of "The Front 
Page," that "Hudsucker" most closely resembles, at least in velocity of words 
and setting. Amy is -- as her colleagues are quite tired of hearing -- a 
Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who smells a story, or at least a rat, when 
Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) is quite suddenly elevated from the mail room to 
the executive offices of Hudsucker Industries. The company's founder, Waring 
Hudsucker (Charles Durning), has just done a Brody from the 44th floor ("45th 
counting the lobby") and the nefarious Sidney J. Mussburger (Newman) is using 
Norville to drive down the price of the stock so the board can buy up a 
majority interest and retain control. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinematographer Roger Deakins' camera work evokes a multitude of film 
references, from "It's a Wonderful Life" to "The Big Clock," to every film 
starring Barbara Stanwyck or Jean Arthur or Carole Lombard. The dialogue is 
rapid-fire, the action, hyperkinetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an homage, definitely," Leigh says. "And it's also about film. 
But it certainly recalls those movies and loves those movies, clearly. It goofs 
on them too, but not as much as it goofs on the characters." 
</P>
<P>
 Although associated more with low life than high comedy, Leigh says she loves 
working for laughs -- the scene in "Hudsucker" where she makes Robbins believe 
she knows the words to his high school song is priceless -- and she loved 
working with the Coens. The way she describes it, though, sounds a bit 
stressful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt while I was doing this movie that I wasn't going to make it 
through," she says. "When I got the part, I thought, 'There's just no way my 
life could be this good, no way I could be this lucky. I'll probably die, I'll 
certainly die.' I even investigated getting a car that had air bags." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the Coens still seems less stressful than interviews ("It's 
funny," she muses. "I've gone from playing three prostitutes to playing three 
jour- nalists . . . "). But she's happy to talk about acting, and what she has 
to go through to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Hudsucker," she had to practice a unique kind of nearly extinct speech 
pattern, that southern New England lockjaw Hepburn has. "I did it a lot," Leigh 
said, "because I wanted it to be comfortable for me. I didn't want it to sound 
artificial 'cause it's such a bizarre way of speaking, that Standard American. 
People just don't do it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was much harder to stand straight," she adds. "The actresses during 
that period always had beautiful posture. They took elocution lessons, took 
posture classes, it was a completely different time. So standing up straight 
was something I had to learn how to do, it wasn't in my repertoire. I learned 
how to type, too . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 This is a gag, as is her typing in "Hudsucker," a leisurely one-finger affair 
that doesn't correspond at all with the words exploding in the voice-over. It's 
part of a loose, goofy style of filmmaking that one does not associate with 
Leigh, although the one thing you can say is there's no standard JJL role. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's good," she says. "I don't want to play the same person twice, 
that's not why I wanted to act. I want to play great roles and work with 
directors I admire, and it's getting easier now. I've always done roles that 
really appealed to me on a gut level and which I found inspiring. So it's great 
that I continue to work and that I get to do great parts. Life is good at the 
moment."

SCORPIONS MOVE PAST OLD THEMES; POP MUSIC: THE GERMAN ROCKERS' NEWFOUND 
SERIOUSNESS IS A MARK OF MATURITY AND A NATURAL REACTION TO THE TIMES, SAYS THE 
BAND'S SINGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When they last played the United States three years ago, the Scorpions were 
enjoying the biggest success of their career with "Wind of Change," a power 
ballad swelling with peaceful hopes and dreams for a world emerging from the 
Cold War's lingering chill. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the veteran German heavy-metal band toured during 1991, singing about 
geopolitical shifts in Eastern Europe, a different wind was starting to blow 
fiercely from the Pacific Northwest. The dark, glowering grunge-alternative 
rock of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and their cohorts was sweeping out of 
Seattle, changing a hard-rock landscape that had long been dominated by 
old-school metal bands like the Scorpions, who typically served up celebrations 
of rock hedonism and strutting exclamations of prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the grunge-led shift in rock's jet stream has turned the weather a bit 
chillier than the Scorpions might like. Sparked by "Wind of Change," the band's 
1990 album "Crazy World" sold 7 million copies worldwide, a career peak. But 
the current album, "Face the Heat," quickly melted from the charts following 
its release last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaus Meine, the Scorpions' singer, has been at this since 1971. He is not 
panicking, nor does he see the dominance of grunge as a reason for his band to 
adopt new styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all the established bands get hurt, more or less, when there's a 
change," said Meine, a small man with a large voice that will be wailing as the 
Scorpions play today at the Forum and Saturday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the Scorpions never jumped on any trends," Meine added in a recent phone 
interview. "We do what we do. We saw, in our career, many waves come and go." 
</P>
<P>
 Meine, 45, doesn't see alternative hard-rock as a threat: "I like some of the 
stuff because it's really rough, and very close to the street. It's just real 
people playing music. I like the new Alice in Chains album, and Stone Temple 
Pilots is one of my favorites. I'm sure the next wave, the next trend, will be 
around the corner. Whether you call it grunge, hard rock or heavy metal, the 
great bands will survive, like always." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Scorpions have avoided jumping on a new bandwagon, Meine notes that 
neither do they want to stand still. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the huge success of 'Wind of Change,' we wanted to make an album that's 
more on the hard side," he said. "We wanted the rock fans to know that the 
Scorpions are still a rock band and were far away from retiring in ballad 
land." 
</P>
<P>
 "Face the Heat" has a couple of good-time rockers on it, as well as another 
idealistic state-of-the-world anthem in "Under the Same Sun," the band's new 
single. But it also has several stormy numbers inspired by lyricist Meine's 
troubled outlook on events in the post-Cold War world. In "Unholy Alliance," a 
dismayed Meine watches the rise of neo-Nazism in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a minority of people, but we can't deny it's still there," Meine 
said. "I think it's important to do something about it. Especially as Germans, 
we can't ever let this happen again. Other German artists write about it, and 
make really clear statements, which is very good." 
</P>
<P>
 With new songs like "Unholy Alliance," "Under the Same Sun," "Alien Nation" 
and "Ship of Fools" all dealing with the precarious state of the world, the 
Scorpions have moved far from typical old-metal themes of revelry and 
us-against-the-adults teen-bonding. One could speculate that it's a calculated 
way of keeping up with hard rock's angry young vanguard, but Meine says that 
his band's newfound seriousness is simply a mark of maturity and a natural 
reaction to the times. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '70s, a lot of stuff was written out of fantasy land," Meine said. 
"Scorpions are not a political band, but it's the '90s and the Scorpions are 
not a nostalgic kind of band. You're growing up as a person, you're growing up 
as a songwriter. 'Wind of Change' proved to me that it's important to write 
songs that matter, that come straight out of the heart. There's nothing wrong 
with saying, 'Let's party,' but when you're past 40 you don't want to make a 
fool out of yourself. You can't just say, 'Hey, let's chase chicks around.' "

HOME TECH / VIDEO: CARSON RELEASES HIS 'FAVORITE MOMENTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Herrrrrrre's Johnny! 
</P>
<P>
 On video, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Carson comes to home video for the first time on May 27, two years 
after he retired from the late-night TV wars. The series from Disney's Buena 
Vista company is dubbed "Johnny Carson: His Favorite Moments From the Tonight 
Show" and features three tapes, priced at $15 each. They're roughly 50 minutes 
each and are divided by years: " '60s and '70s," " '70s and '80s" and " '80s 
and '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth tape, of Carson's highly rated final show, will be available only as 
part of a package with the other three, for $60. The lone behind-the-scenes 
segment is on this tape. "It's a look at how the show is put together," said 
producer Jeff Sotzing. 
</P>
<P>
 This collection is different from the Carson compilations that previously have 
been syndicated on TV, which featured only sketches from "The Tonight Show." 
The home video collection features parts of monologues and guest-star segments 
-- including David Letterman, Robin Williams, Dean Martin and Don Rickles -- 
plus sketches. There is no commentary from Carson, though he does offer 
assorted insights in the liner notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson helped choose the final tapes from a batch of footage initially culled 
by Sotzing from nearly 30 years worth of shows. But that doesn't mean it was a 
labor of love for the entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was reluctant to do it," Sotzing said. "It wasn't Johnny's favorite thing. 
He's busy with other things and didn't want to be bothered." 
</P>
<P>
 When selecting the segments, Sotzing said, he and Carson chose what was most 
entertaining -- or, more specifically, what's funny. "We could have done a 
montage of all the politicians who've appeared on the show, but that wouldn't 
have been as entertaining as a look at various comics' first appearances on the 
show -- like Jay Leno and David Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
 Sotzing and Buena Vista say these are the only "Tonight Show" tapes that will 
be released. "There won't be any more," Sotzing insisted. "It's not fair to 
people who buy these tapes to say in six months, 'Here's some other stuff we 
forgot to include.' There are many ways to assemble the remaining footage in 
categories -- singers, animals, comics -- but we don't want to do that. We 
don't want to saturate the market." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the series is a huge hit and there's a big demand for more tapes, don't 
be surprised if Sotzing and Carson are persuaded to return to the editing room 
and crank out another collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson won't be the first late-night host to reach home video. Late next 
month, GoodTimes premieres its "Late Night With David Letterman" series, with 
six tapes selling for $20 each. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fugitive" (Warner, $25). Great action/thriller, based on the '60s TV 
series, starring Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble, the target of a 
relentless manhunt. Wrongly convicted of murdering his wife, he's searching for 
the real killer, the mysterious one-armed man. As the U.S. Marshal doggedly 
pursuing the doctor, Tommy Lee Jones dwarfs the whole cast -- even Ford, who's 
very good. The famous opening train wreck doesn't lose its impact on the TV 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manhattan Murder Mystery" (Columbia TriStar). Woody Allen's version of the 
frothy comedy-mysteries that were so popular in the '30s and '40s. Diane Keaton 
plays an upscale New Yorker who's convinced her neighbor killed his wife -- an 
apparent heart attack victim. Playing amateur detective, she involves her 
reluctant husband (Allen) and his pals (Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston). For 
Allen fans, a welcome return to the wacky, sophisticated fun of his '60s and 
'70s movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "King of the Hill" (MCA/Universal). Steven Soderbergh, who did "sex, lies and 
videotape," wrote and directed this terrific drama about a resourceful 
12-year-old (Jesse Bradford) living in a St. Louis hotel and struggling -- 
mostly alone -- during the Depression. One of the best films of last year, it 
was ignored by audiences -- probably because it's too grim and unsentimental. 
Watching his vivid struggle isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judgment Night" (MCA/Universal). Emilio Estevez and Cuba Gooding Jr. play 
half of a quartet of macho wanna-bes who witness a murder in a Chicago ghetto 
and spend a night trying to escape the killer (Denis Leary). Alternately 
suspenseful and cliched but ultimately neither satisfying nor involving. For 
young music fans, the inventive rap/metal score is the best thing about the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 Just announced: Warner's "A Perfect World," starring Kevin Costner and Clint 
Eastwood, is scheduled for May 4; Disney's "The Three Musketeers," with Charlie 
Sheen and Kiefer Sutherland, comes out May 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Also: "Undercover Blues," "Gettysburg" and "Bopha!" (Wednesday); "What's Love 
Got to Do With It" and "Fatal Instinct" (March 23); "The Joy Luck Club," "M. 
Butterfly," "Dazed and Confused" and "Father Hood" (March 30); "The Age of 
Innocence," "Fearless," "A Bronx Tale" and "The Beverly Hillbillies" (April 6); 
"Carlito's Way" and "Malice" (April 13); "Mr. Jones," "Another Stakeout," 
"Flesh and Bone" and "The Saint of Fort Washington" (April 20); "Mrs. 
Doubtfire" (April 26); "The Remains of the Day" (May 4); "Into the West" (May 
11).

TOP 12 ALL-STAR TRUMPETERS OF ALL TIME; MUSIC: HORNS HAVE PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE 
IN THE JAZZ WORLD SINCE THE FIRST SOLOIST, BUDDY BOLDEN, USED THE CORNET TO 
ORNAMENT MELODIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What if they gave an all-star jazz party and no trumpeters came? 
</P>
<P>
 More than any other instrument, the horn would be conspicuous by its absence. 
From the beginning of time -- jazz time, that is -- the trumpet or cornet has 
been central to the music. Trumpeters functioned as actual or de facto leaders 
of the most influential groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Legend tells us the first jazz soloist was Buddy Bolden, 1877-1931, a New 
Orleans cornetist whose band played the honky-tonks of Storyville a century 
ago. Though it is said that he ornamented melodies rather than improvising 
freely, he supposedly became a formative influence on trumpeters Freddie 
Keppard, Bunk Johnson and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact and influence of such men will never be known; Bolden did not 
record: Keppard (1890-1933) and Johnson (1899-1949), both prominent in the 
early 1900s, recorded too little and too late to offer an idea of their 
reported pristine brilliance. Both, however, were heard in New Orleans and 
Chicago by the most influential hornman ever, Louis Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Keppard, it is said by historians, had a chance to bring a black jazz band to 
records in 1916, but refused the offer for fear that he would be imitated by 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the first jazz group ever recorded was an all-white original 
Dixieland Band, led by a trumpeter, Nick La Rocca, in 1917. The first memorable 
series of recordings by a black jazz band was led by King Oliver, out of whose 
ranks Armstrong emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 What does young America today know about Louis Armstrong or Dizzy Gillespie? 
Asking for an explanation of their role in history would be as productive as 
expecting a Tom Cruise fan to explain the importance of John Gilbert. To many 
young listeners only Wynton Marsalis' name strikes a chord, though his role as 
an individual stylist remains to be firmly defined. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there are young talents vying for attention -- perhaps too many. Time 
was when a jazzman served his apprenticeship with name bands before graduating 
to leadership. Today he may be vaulted from the unknown to become an overnight 
public relations vehicle, surrounded by producers, record companies and 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the current crop of players, Roy Hargrove, Terence Blanchard and Wallace 
Roney may be admired for their exploration of the trumpet roots; Ryan Kisor for 
his prodigious technique, Tom Harrell for his lyricism; but who among them will 
make it into the pantheon of the 21st Century?  
</P>
<P>
 In listing history's most identifiable or influential trumpeters, no 
disrespect is meant to those who, while pointing the music in an evolutionary 
path, left it to others to make the most definitive steps forward. Louis 
Armstrong 
</P>
<P>
 Conjuring magisterial melodic gems out of deceptively simple lines, with a 
purity of sound that was unmatched, Armstrong in the late 1920s created a 
series of masterpieces by small groups (the Hot Five and Hot Seven) that built 
a worldwide impact. His most durable works from this era are still available on 
CBS reissues. Bubber Miley 
</P>
<P>
 In 1923 he joined Elmer Snowden's Washingtonians, which became Duke 
Ellington's orchestra. During almost six years with the band he initiated the 
practice of altering the sound of his horn through the use of a rubber plunger 
mute to achieve a growl or "wa-wa" effect. Cootie Williams and Ray Nance, 
fellow-Ellingtonians, copied the style, as have thousands of other trumpeters. 
Miley can be heard on the band's early RCA and Columbia versions of "Black and 
Tan Fantasy," "Creole Love Call" and "The Mooche." Bix Beiderbecke 
</P>
<P>
 The first great cornetist (despite its shorter appearance and softer sound, 
the terms cornet and trumpet were often used interchangeably; Bobby Hackett and 
others used both instruments regularly). Though almost unknown to the public 
during his brief career, Beiderbecke enchanted musicians with his bell-like, 
lyrical tone, heard in a famous series or small group sessions with saxophonist 
Frank Trumbauer, and in the bands of Jean Goldkette and Paul Whiteman. He was 
the first white musician to inspire blacks (Rex Stewart of the Ellington band 
copied his solos) and is well remembered also as a composer-pianist, whose solo 
recording of his "In a Mist" was decades ahead of its time. Most of his best 
work is still available on CBS. Roy Eldridge 
</P>
<P>
 The next giant in the post-Armstrong line, "Little Jazz" Eldridge brought an 
intensely emotional quality to his solos along with a sense of harmony and 
technical dexterity that he employed to create a unique sense of crackling 
tension. Though he led his own bands off and on, he was one of the few great 
black artists prominently featured in white swing-era bands, with Gene Krupa, 
1941-43, Artie Shaw, 1944, Benny Goodman, 1950. Though a pre-bop figure, he was 
the first major influence on be-bop pioneer Dizzy Gillespie. Bunny Berigan 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong named Berigan as his No. 1 choice in a "Musicians' Musicians" poll. 
His second choice was Bobby Hackett: He admired both for their personal timbre 
and attack (Berigan reflected a strong Armstrong influence). Like Beiderbecke, 
Berigan had a short career destroyed by alcoholism, but his best recordings ("I 
Can't Get Started" as both trumpeter and singer, in two versions on CBS and 
RCA, and "Marie" on RCA with the Tommy Dorsey band) still inspire young 
trumpeters almost six decades later. Henry Red Allen 
</P>
<P>
 This New Orleans disciple of Armstrong moved from his big-band years (with 
Luis Russell, Fletcher Henderson and Armstrong) into a period that found him 
developing a singularly fluid way of phrasing as well as a variety of unique 
tonal effects (growls, trills, legato articulation). An exceptional interpreter 
of the blues, he carried the banner for swinging tradition even during Dizzy 
Gillespie's heyday. Dizzy Gillespie 
</P>
<P>
 He was Picasso to Armstrong's Rembrandt. By 1945, when his style was fully 
formed, Gillespie had developed the most distinctive personality of this 
century's second half, marked by dramatic melodic shifts, harmonic and melodic 
alterations that were at first misconstrued as "wrong notes," and unprecedented 
technical facility. He was a pervasive influence both as soloist and composer 
(his "Con Alma," "Night in Tunisia" and others are now standard repertoire). As 
has been true with many of the arts, yesterday's avant-garde became, through 
Gillespie, today's mainstream. His best early work is on Musicraft; later 
sessions on Verve. Clark Terry 
</P>
<P>
 A multiple influence playing trumpet, fluegelhorn (with its fuller, richer 
sound), singing (often to comedic effect) and teaching at colleges, Terry like 
Gillespie has blended musical and entertainment values. Best known for his 
sojourn with Duke Ellington (1951-59), he expanded on a "squeezed tone" effect 
originated by a previous Ellingtonian, Rex Stewart. His impact has been 
fortified by innumerable recordings as leader and with Ellington, Oscar 
Peterson, Bob Brookmeyer, et al. Miles Davis 
</P>
<P>
 A technically limited figure in the early bop days, he became a potent force 
in the 1950s through modal playing (using scales rather than chords), his use 
of the fluegelhorn, and his unique series of collaborations with arranger Gil 
Evans on "Sketches of Spain" and other albums. He later helped popularize 
jazz-rock, retired for several years, but recaptured some of his earlier glory 
in a final concert at Montreux, heard on Warner Bros. His best albums ("Kind of 
Blue," "In a Silent Way," "Porgy and Bess") are on CBS. Clifford Brown 
</P>
<P>
 His brief time in the limelight (mainly as co-leader with Max Roach of a 
quintet) earned the admiration of trumpeters ever since, on the strength of his 
rich sound and brilliantly crafted solos. There are numerous memorial albums on 
EmArcy and other labels. Don Cherry 
</P>
<P>
 A maverick known for his work on a so-called pocket cornet, he has had a 
roller-coaster career with Ornette Coleman, then with rock singers and bands, 
and later with World Music groups in which he experimented on flute and 
percussion. CDs with Coleman on Contemporary, own groups on Blue Note. Art 
Farmer 
</P>

MEDITATION ON BEING A ROMANIAN; THEATER: OANA-MARIA HOCK SAYS HER 'ALMOND 
SELLER' ISN'T POLITICAL. 'IT'S ABOUT ROMANIA'S STRUGGLE FOR A COLLECTIVE 
IDENTITY IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS NEW SOCIAL ORDER.' 
</P>

<P>
 In the early summer of 1990, playwright Oana-Maria Hock visited her native 
Romania. What she found was a country struggling to find itself after a 
revolution that abolished Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's reviled dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, had been executed a few 
months before, and Romania's new leader, Ion Iliescu, faced a crisis as 
hundreds of students fought with thousands of miners in Bucharest over the 
direction the new government was taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Hock witnessed the protests and riots in the streets. Fearing the violence, 
she eventually retreated to her hotel room, wondering if Romania would ever 
recover. In the wake of that experience, the 40-year-old dramatist wrote "The 
Almond Seller," which had its West Coast premiere Thursday at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, one of seven by Hock that have been produced in theaters from New 
York to San Diego since she emigrated to the United States in 1980, uses the 
bloody battle between the miners and students as a backdrop. Thrown into this 
real-life event are Hock's central creations: three young Romanians and the 
title character, who is an almond seller and gravedigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the Romanians are men, once close and now fighting on opposite sides. 
The third is a female journalist, now living in the United States, who returns 
to naively "do a photographic essay of free Romania." 
</P>
<P>
 As described in a 1991 New York Times review of the play's U.S. premiere, 
she's the heroine "caught up by the siege of events . . . clear that she has 
returned too late. As the playwright indicates, to know a revolution one must 
live through it -- or die in it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, "The Almond Seller" is a political play. But Hock, who now lives in 
Montreal, was quick to dismiss any notions that her work has an overriding 
political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it that way. I see it more as a theatrical meditation about the 
meaning of being a Romanian," she said in a recent telephone interview. "It's 
about a country that has been mutilated by Communism. . . . It's about 
Romania's struggle for a collective identity in the middle of this new social 
order." 
</P>
<P>
 Hock noted that "The Almond Seller" is highly symbolic, despite the use of 
recent history as an anchor. The almond seller, for instance, roots for relics 
in a mass grave, finding "a holy mess" of bones, spoons and wild radishes that 
Hock said are metaphors for Romania's past. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is certainly a mythical character," she explained. "He knows that the 
people are in crisis and must dig into their past to find truth. You have to 
dig very deep, be very passionate about it, to find yourself, your cultural 
self. Without that, you can't move on to your future." 
</P>
<P>
 As for that future, Hock is optimistic. She said the Romanian people are in 
the midst of a rocky rebirth that will take a long time; shifting from 
socialism to democracy is a hard transition. But Hock believes that Romania 
eventually will "advance politically, artistically and economically." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when Hock doubted that could happen. Before coming to the 
United States, she was a drama critic for the state-run National Theater in 
Bucharest. Her experiences provided a microcosm for the repression that 
affected the entire country. 
</P>
<P>
 All plays were censored, as well as her reviews and essays. The Ceausescu 
government banned certain writers, including Samuel Beckett and Eugene Ionesco, 
for their nihilistic views; other dramatists were outlawed for their political 
bents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, she said, this oppression created a theater of subtle defiance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living under Ceausescu was such a nightmare, and the theater was one . . . 
escape," Hock said. "Paradoxically, it was a very good theater (both 
underground and in mainstream arenas) because metaphor was used at the highest 
level. We couldn't express anything in a direct way, so allegory had to be 
clever enough to fool them." 
</P>
<P>
 In her visits following Ceausescu's overthrow, Hock has been buoyed by the 
regeneration in the stage that has come with new freedoms. It will take a while 
before the events are placed in perspective ("artists are too close to it now," 
she said), but Hock feels it's only a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also hopeful that there won't be a repeat of the violence she observed 
in 1990. Hock said she was horrified when 7,000 miners attacked students -- 
many who protested that Communists had been retained in the new government, 
which they claimed was dictatorial -- after Iliescu publicly denounced the 
students on television. The miners, it was alleged, had been operating under 
orders from Iliescu or his subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terrible; you felt it was coming out of the legacy of Ceausescu," Hock 
said. "The miners were acting out of the repressed anger of that regime. It was 
the effect of living under violence for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
 As for her own future, Hock plans to return to Romania again, maybe in the 
fall, to produce one of her plays there for the first time. She isn't sure but 
thinks it may be "Waiting for Godot to Leave," a still-unfinished piece that 
picks up where Beckett's famous absurdist comedy "Waiting for Godot" leaves 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hock also would like to see UCI's production of "The Almond Seller," which is 
being directed by her longtime friend, drama professor Annie Loui. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Annie understands what I'm trying to do with my writing. She has a 
wonderful way of visualizing it," Hock said. "I'm not sure I'll be able to 
come, but I'd love to see it for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Almond Seller" is at the Fine Arts Studio Theatre, UC Irvine, through 
March 19. $6-$8. (714) 856-6616 or (714) 856-5000.

SPARE TIME FOR MATH; BOWLING PROGRAM LETS SANTA ANA PUPILS PICK UP LESSONS IN 
NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With his brow knitted in concentration, Marco Arreguin, 9, stared at the white 
bowling pins at the end of the playground's makeshift alley and lifted his ball 
in front of his face. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Please let it be a strike," he said to himself as he stepped forward and 
launched the scuffed plastic ball with a two-handed throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, the ball spun to the center of the lane and scattered all 10 
pins. "Yeah!" he shouted, punching the air and dancing a victory jig down the 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he may not have looked like it, Marco was learning math. He and other 
third- and fourth-graders at Wilson Elementary were participating in an 
innovative learning program -- a kind of "Bowling for Scholars" -- that lets 
students pick up math concepts along with strikes and spares. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of sitting in a classroom and learning to compute averages from a list 
of random numbers, students take to the lanes and use math to determine how 
well they score during an average game, teacher Gail Dasno said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, each day's lesson "is more effective because it relates to them. 
Since it's their scores, they really want to know the answers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also get to apply what they learn in class to the real world. For 
example, they used recent lessons about measurements and accuracy to determine 
whether their bowling alleys were 60 feet long, as the rules require. The idea 
is to get the children excited about learning by getting them personally 
involved in their lessons, Dasno said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, created as part of a partnership between local bowling centers 
and the Santa Ana Unified School District, is now offered at 20 campuses 
throughout the year. The bowling centers provide the equipment and also offer 
occasional free games at their lanes for children and their parents. So far, 
the program, which has been running since last July, has kept the children 
enthusiastic about any schoolwork related to their new sport, Dasno said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bug me every day: 'When are we going to go bowling again?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which is sponsored in part by a local bowling center, originally 
focused on physical education. However, teachers soon realized they could 
easily use it to tie in math and problem solving, as well as boost children's 
self-esteem. Dasno said that the program also teaches students sportsmanship, 
hand-eye coordination, cooperation and the importance of following rules. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, 32 children gathered into teams on the cement playground and 
tossed plastic bowling balls at the pins. In the absence of gutters and 
automatic pinsetters, the children picked up the scattered pins themselves and 
put them back into place, gleefully yelling encouragement to the next bowler. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the exercise, the students called out scores for the players' 
frames so that they could calculate their averages later. Back in the 
classroom, they hunched over their score sheets and added up their strikes, 
spares and gutter balls. Then they divided them by the number of frames to 
determine their average and excitedly compared their statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of kids like it," said Vanessa Terrazas, 9. "When you're doing 
it, people are all (yelling), 'Yeah!' and 'Woo-woo!' It's really fun (but) you 
learn more about math." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Mendoza, 9, agreed. "I like to throw strikes. When I get it right, I feel 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 His love of the game has affected his schoolwork and made learning as easy as 
knocking down pins. "I didn't know how to do division before," he said. "Then I 
learned how to bowl and now I do."

DANA PARSONS: 200 YEARS OF FAMILY HISTORY SPURS LANDSLIDE OF EMOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is national Women's History Month, which has significance far beyond the 
reference point I have in mind: a church gymnasium last July in Port Arthur, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion on that typically sweltering Gulf Coast day at the Procter Street 
Baptist Church was my grandmother's 97th birthday. Grandma was clearly the 
headliner, but the added attraction was that five generations of women in the 
family were, for the first time, going to be in the same place at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd been awaiting the moment with more gleeful anticipation than anything 
else. "It's going to be neat," I told friends. So, when mid-party came and the 
five of them posed for a photo, I was caught off guard by the raw emotion 
captured in the instant the shutter clicked. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the five of them there -- Grandma, my mother, my sister, my niece and 
my niece's 3-month-old daughter -- I got the proverbial lump in the throat and 
misty eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was nothing more than contemplating history's sweep; after all, 
Grandma was born in 1896, and it's not inconceivable that my niece's daughter 
could live until 2096. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hundred years of family history. Five generations of women's lives -- 
already a tapestry partly unfolded but with so much more to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagining what these women knew, what joys they'd had, what secrets they'd 
kept, what they'd had to put up with . . . well, on the one hand, it's nothing 
more than this thing we call "Life." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it's a staggering compilation of laughter and tears, of 
choices and non-choices, of opportunities and demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandma was born in rural Louisiana, outside Baton Rouge. She taught 
elementary school but quit to raise four children. Those plans were dashed when 
she was widowed in her 40th year and, with kids still at home and needing 
money, she began a new career as a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom was born, with a midwife attending, in the backwater Louisiana house she 
would live in. As she reached her mid-30s in the early 1960s, she didn't have 
lofty designs on being a professional woman, but family finances dictated that 
she become one. Choices? What choices? Year in and year out, going to work with 
no real prospect of major advancement, she did what had to be done. When she 
retired, her colleagues lauded her beyond all proportion, yet I have no doubt 
that she was, in the classic post-World War II tradition, perennially 
underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 My sister, now in her late 40s, bridged the eras. She joined the labor force 
right out of high school, worked on the cheap, but later benefited from the 
Bell system owning up to its responsibility to female employees. Over the 
years, she has carved out a successful career, but she also had a luxury in 
middle age that our mother never had -- being financially able for a few years 
to take a sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift of choice has been handed down to my niece, who, at 25, has chosen to 
stay at home with her baby. So far, her best-laid plans haven't gone awry. Her 
husband is a well-paid machinist who thinks it's great his wife doesn't have to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about that fifth-generation baby Jessica, hurtling toward her first 
birthday next month? How will she look back on her life in 30, 50 or 90 years? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if the dramas of the women in her family tree will seem as huge to 
her as they do to me. I say they're huge, and yet they are no more than 
representative of the spectrum of women's lives in America. Grandma was 
prematurely widowed; mom was married for 48 years; my sister has tasted 
divorce; my niece suffered through her parents' divorce and eventually married 
her stepbrother. All rich stories, interspersed with days of quiet pathos and 
rich rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose that's why, maybe on a subconscious level, I was moved while 
watching the five of them together last summer. At some point, they were all 
baby Jessicas, born into a world that, unbeknownst to them, would be both 
promising and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish it could have been easier for all of them. I hope Jessica breezes 
through. Failing that, I hope her elders teach her not to settle for things, 
not to see her life in limited terms and not to blame others for the turns it 
takes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my favorite songs is the Stevie Nicks tune "Landslide." The lyrics have 
always touched me, because it seems she has hit on the eternal questions: 
</P>
<P>
 Mirror in the sky, what is love?  
</P>
<P>
 Can the child within my heart rise above?  
</P>
<P>
 Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?  
</P>
<P>
 Can I handle the seasons of my life?  
</P>
<P>
 When these four women and one little girl do their reflecting on their lives 
and ask themselves whether they did, indeed, handle the seasons of their lives, 
I hope with all my heart that their answer is: 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I handled them." 
</P>

GOLF COURSE SINKHOLE PERILS NEARBY PCH; STABILIZATION: GIANT CRATER AND A 
DAMAGED UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE CHANNEL BELOW IT ARE ONLY 25 FEET FROM THE 
IMPORTANT TRAFFIC ARTERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Emergency crews are scrambling to repair a strange crater-size hole on a Dana 
Point golf course and a damaged underground drainage channel that threaten to 
undermine nearby Pacific Coast Highway and sewer and gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The hole, estimated to be 80 feet long, 40 feet wide and 30 feet deep, was 
discovered by surprised maintenance workers near the 13th green at the Links at 
Monarch Beach golf course on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, nobody knew what created the mysterious hole, but eventually, Orange 
County public works officials found evidence that an aging drainage channel 30 
to 40 feet underground had cracked, causing the ground above it to sink. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could cause catastrophic failure if the roof (of the channel) was to 
finally cave in," said Jim Miller, chief of flood control design for the 
county. "The main thing is we don't want additional movement or dropping to 
occur." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for problems -- the four-lane coastal highway is only 25 feet 
away -- prompted the County Board of Supervisors this week to declare a local 
emergency in the area and authorize an initial $200,000 funds for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, county crewmen had begun fixing the broken 14-foot-high drainage 
channel, although officials still do not know the extent of the damage. Like 
miners, workers are laboring in the damp darkness of intact sections of the 
channel, trying to support the vulnerable tunnel with a concrete foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really like a mining operation, working deep inside the culvert," said 
Jim Williams, an engineer for the county's Environmental Management Agency. 
"The good news is there is a golf course above it . . . and we have access 
large enough to drive a truck and equipment into it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the project could take six months and hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to finish. And, if the hole expands, it could cause a break in the 
highway, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the situation continued to deteriorate it could cause damage to PCH," he 
said. "If it was sudden, someone (on the roadway) could get hurt. But we are in 
there to prevent something like that from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Golf course spokesman Ben Cagle said the course remains open and there is no 
danger to players. The damaged area has been roped off and lies just off the 
13th green near the tony Ritz Cove housing development on the ocean side of 
Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The large hole in the golf course apparently appeared overnight, according to 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf course employees "told us when they went home on Sunday afternoon, 
everything looked OK, but when they came in on the 21st, they saw it," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 County crews later discovered the sinkhole was only a symptom of a problem 
about 30 to 40 feet underground, Miller said. The sinkhole can easily be 
filled, but it could take months to fix the underground channel, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the damage is near a junction connecting an old section of the storm 
drain to a newer one, Miller said. A break at the junction has allowed water to 
seep into the ground and dirt to sink into the big channel, or culvert. 
</P>
<P>
 Escaping water has destroyed the channel's foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The box culvert is actually floating on water," said Jerry Sterling, a senior 
county engineer. "It's hard to believe when you see the size of it, but it's 
happening."  
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that an old section of the channel was built in an arch 
shape in 1932, when Pacific Coast Highway was constructed through south Orange 
County. The rest of the drainage culvert, which is box shaped, was attached in 
1973 when developers graded the Salt Creek area, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arch is not built in the same way the box is built," Miller said. "The 
downstream end of the arch structure has dropped, pulling the roof section 
away. . . . We don't know what caused it to drop; right now we are more 
interested in stabilizing it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't really even want to speculate what caused it," Williams said. "For 
whatever reason, water is running underneath" the culvert. A New Hole on 13 A 
huge hole that appeared overnight near the 13th green on a Dana Point golf 
course may have been caused by water leakage from a crack in an underground 
storm drain. What likely happened: 1. Storm drain sections separate; bottom of 
older storm drain settles and cracks; dirt trickles in from above. 2. Water 
gushes out, eroding soil and weakening foundation of storm drain. 3. Soil is 
destblized in funnel effect, creating massive hole above ground. Section built 
in 1932. Buried 30-40 feet below ground. Sinkhole is 80 feet long, 40 feet wide 
and 30 feet deep. Section built in 1973. Storm drain: 12 feet wide and 14 feet 
high big enough to drive a truck through. Note: Drawing not to scale. Source:

36 SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES JOIN 'BLUE FLU' ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN RAY BALLOU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-six Orange County sheriff's deputies participated in a "blue flu" job 
action Thursday, marking the second time in as many weeks that officers have 
called in sick to protest an eight-month-long contract dispute over wages and 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, 20 deputies and two sergeants from the central men's jail and 11 
investigators, two deputies and one sergeant from the professional standards 
division called in sick. 
</P>
<P>
 The sick-out by jail officers on the 10:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. shift did not 
affect safety, but did slow down operations there, said Lt. Dan Martini, a 
department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no enhanced danger for officer or inmate safety there," Martini 
said. "But we're looking at the 10th-largest facility in the state. It's like a 
machine and anytime you interrupt that machine, it will have a measurable 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Although all deputies were replaced at the jail, Martini said, the fill-in 
officers were not familiar with their assignments, which resulted in a work 
slowdown. No replacements were ordered at the professional standards division, 
which handles personnel matters and issues business licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest was organized by the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, which 
is asking for a three-year contract with a 3.5% pay raise for the second and 
third years. They are not seeking a raise in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has offered 3% raises for the second and third years, said 
association general manager Robert MacLeod. He said the county is not 
sufficiently funding medical and other types of benefits for deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If current protests don't work in the next one or two weeks, we will change 
our tactics and try something more severe," MacLeod said. He would not comment 
on other types of protests the association might use but said they would not 
affect public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators on both sides have been meeting since August, and deputies have 
been working since October without a contract.

 "The association is still dissatisfied with negotiations but I have to 
compliment them on the way they're dealing with county officials -- they've 
been very honest in their protest goals," Martini said. "They are trying to 
deliver a message to the county without jeopardizing the safety of the 
community and other deputies." 
</P>
<P>
 On March 3, after the association's 1,300 members voted to support a job 
action protest, about 20 sheriff's deputies from the department's Northern 
Division called in sick. Officers were told to call early enough so that the 
department would have enough time to replace them.

PROP. 73 BACKERS TRY TO REVIVE LAW; POLITICS: STATE SUPREME COURT MIGHT FIX 
WORDING, REINSTATE CAMPAIGN-FINANCE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Backers of Proposition 73, a successful 1988 state ballot measure that limited 
campaign contributions in state and local elections but was later struck down 
by federal courts, have launched an effort to revive the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia) and state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp, an 
independent from San Francisco, are planning to file legal papers Monday asking 
the California Supreme Court to correct any unconstitutional provisions and 
reinstitute the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's precedent for the court going in and modifying ballot measures to 
clear up constitutional questions and fulfill the wishes of the voters," 
Johnson said Thursday. "We intend to ask them to do just that." 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of Proposition 73 was declared unconstitutional in a February, 1992, 
final ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court ruled 
that the measure discriminated by favoring incumbents because its contribution 
limits -- $1,000 for individuals and businesses and $5,000 for political action 
committees -- were based on a fiscal year instead of an election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Since challengers usually don't decide to run until a few months before an 
election, the appeals court declared, incumbents would have an advantage under 
Proposition 73 to build up large campaign war chests by tapping contributors 
several times in the years before an election. They suggested that the law 
instead should have been based on an election cycle, meaning a donor could give 
up to the limit only one time before election day. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson still disagrees with the ruling, but said he and Kopp believe the 
state Supreme Court can easily fix any flaws in the law -- and that the 
justices have suggested they would be willing to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas said in a December ruling on a related case that 
the constitutional questions underlying the rejection of Proposition 73 are 
matters of state law. In a footnote to the written opinion, Lucas said "one can 
only wonder" why backers of Proposition 73 had not asked the state Supreme 
Court to step in. Problems with the measure, Lucas said, "are arguably 
susceptible to a construction by the state's highest court that repairs any 
constitutional infirmity." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the chief justice was suggesting that the state Supreme Court 
might be able to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't have a more direct invitation," Johnson said. "Clearly they have 
the power to recast the language of the measure to remove any problems and 
effectuate the intent of the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some participants in the fight for campaign-finance reform welcomed news of 
the effort by Johnson and Kopp, who co-authored Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just my own opinion, but at this point I think any limitation would 
be better than what we have now," said Bob Stern, co-director of the California 
Commission on Campaign Financing, a private research organization. "It has its 
flaws, but at the same time it will start to clean up the process and reduce 
the perception that government is corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
 But others expressed concern. Ruth Holton, executive director of California 
Common Cause, a political watchdog group, said she is concerned about reviving 
Proposition 73 because "contribution limits themselves don't answer the whole 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have elected officials simply spending more time raising money," 
Holton said. "You need the counterbalance of spending limits and public 
financing." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 73 was approved by 58% of the voters in the June, 1988, election, 
beating out a rival campaign-finance measure, Proposition 68, which got 53% of 
the vote. The election came amid growing concerns that the huge of amounts of 
campaign cash contributed to lawmakers each year by special interest groups was 
having a corrupting influence on the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Although voters approved both, the measures have mostly been mired in the 
courts ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 68, which included spending limits and public financing of races, 
was almost immediately thrown out by the courts because its rival received more 
votes -- and included a ban on public financing. Proposition 73, meanwhile, was 
in effect for the 1990 elections, and dramatically reduced the amount of 
campaign cash contributed. It dropped from $79.4 million in 1988 to $52 million 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from contribution limits, the measure included a ban on transfers of 
campaign cash between candidates, a tactic commonly used by legislative leaders 
to maintain their hold on power. Its campaign-finance restrictions applied to 
candidates for local and state office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the measure was ruled unconstitutional in 1992, backers of the rival 
Proposition 68 responded by asking the state Supreme Court to reinstitute their 
campaign-finance proposal, reasoning that it had gotten a majority vote and 
would fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
 Their pleas were rejected in the December opinion written by Lucas. But the 
same ruling yielded the revelation that the state Supreme Court justices might 
be willing to tinker with Proposition 73 to make it pass constitutional muster. 
</P>
<P>
 Holton questioned whether the law would mostly benefit Republicans, who have a 
bigger pool of contributors in the $1,000 range. She said challengers and 
candidates in minority communities would be hurt for similar reasons. Although 
the measure caused campaign contributions to drop, Holton said, the funding gap 
between incumbents and challengers jumped from 6 to 1 in 1988 to 8 to 1 in 1990 
under Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern agreed that Democrats "will probably have conniption fits over this," 
but said that similar contribution limits have been enacted by 
Democratic-dominated Legislatures in other states. California Democrats, he 
said, "fear change because they've won with this system for years."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; BUILDING ON THE PAST IN OLD TOWNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's downtown may get a face lift in hopes of adding -- not subtracting 
-- years to its appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of local architects have unveiled a proposal to preserve the 
downtown's historic character and help stimulate commercial growth in the plaza 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of more than 2,500 volunteer hours from 10 architects over a 
two-year period, the proposal calls for redesigning more than 75 building 
facades near the downtown circle. 
</P>
<P>
 The same buildings are already slated for a $3.3-million seismic retrofitting 
project, approximately half of which the city will pay. Architects are 
encouraging downtown property owners to incorporate their voluntary design 
proposals for their facades as work on the retrofitting project gets underway 
over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you step back and look at it from an aesthetic point of view, the circle 
and Old Towne are what Orange is really known for and we feel it's important 
that it be preserved and hopefully improved," said Leason Pomeroy, who owns a 
downtown building and heads the group of volunteer architects. "Also, if the 
facades are improved, sales and rents are likely to go up, which would mean the 
city will get more taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack McGee, director of community development, agrees the design proposal 
would enhance the plaza district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows people's roots," McGee said. "It shows where the city started. There 
is a great importance placed on those things here and we want to preserve it." 
</P>
<P>
 The facade designs were taken from historical photos of the plaza district, 
which was founded before the turn of the century. If photos weren't available, 
architects chose a style indicative of the time period of nearby buildings, 
Pomeroy said.  
</P>
<P>
 But not everybody is so enthusiastic. Some property owners, who viewed the 
proposal about three weeks ago, think it's premature to talk about the facades 
since the details of the retrofitting project have yet to be spelled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we all think it looks real pretty," said Mike Alvarez, head of the the 
downtown district's property owners group. "But our real concern is paying for 
seismic right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the architects' proposal already has the endorsement of the City 
Council and is on display at City Hall. Because of the council approvals, 
property owners who follow the design can shave weeks off the customary permit 
process, say city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Some facades might require up to $50,000 while others would need only minimal 
work, said Pomeroy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusual to have architects work together," said Pomeroy, who is 
submitting the proposal to a number of national and state design contests. 
"Architects are usually very independent, but here there was a wonderful 
collaborative spirit and people took criticism well and we ended up with a good 
product." MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CITY UNVEILS PLANS FOR COMMUNITY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new downtown community center will cost $18 million and will include a 
central meeting hall, an art museum, a theater, a pool and a gym, according to 
plans announced by the city this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would be built in two phases and on both sides of Philadelphia 
Street between Center Street and Broadway, according to the plan. It would also 
include construction of a new YMCA and a Boys and Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Taormina, president of the city's trash haulers and a leader of the 
committee that wrote the proposal, said the panel's goal was to bring several 
city groups together to try to devise a facility they all could use. Included 
were representatives of senior and youth groups and the art community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has been looking for their own facility, so rather than have each 
group trying for the same limited resources, we wanted to put them all 
together," Taormina said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase, which would cost $6.5 million, would include a senior center, 
the general meeting room, the gym and part of the museum. Under the proposal, 
funding would come from federal, state and county grants, sale of the current 
downtown senior center site, a $2-million insurance settlement the city is set 
to receive and some private grants. Construction could begin next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase would include the completion of the art center, the theater, 
the YMCA and the Boys and Girls Club and the pool, which would be operated by 
the YMCA. This phase would be paid by private fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members criticized the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Feldhaus said the committee was not thinking big enough. He 
said a city with a major-league stadium and arena should have an equally grand 
community center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why we should settle for second best," Feldhaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Irv Pickler said he wants to see more emphasis given to facilities 
aimed at children. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will be asked to hire an architect to design the project by 
spring. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; DEVELOPER SOUGHT IN SCHOOL LAND PROJECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Centralia School District is looking for a developer to finish a housing 
project in La Palma that was halted because the real estate market bottomed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 More than four years ago the district sold an eight-acre site off La Palma 
Avenue and Walker Street near Central Park to a developer with plans to build 
48 houses, said Paul Burkart, fiscal services director.  
</P>
<P>
 But the developer, La Palma Homes Equity, a limited partnership, only built 
and sold 18 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the project completed, the school board this week approved waiving the 
formal bid process and agreed to find a developer with strong financial backing 
to buy the 30 lots and construct the remaining homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping now that things will move along," said Trustee Karen Blake. "I 
hope that we find a new developer and he goes in there and finishes the 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 The district property had been set aside for a new school site, but a school 
was never needed, Burkart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkart said two developers are interested in buying the property. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Burkart said, La Palma Homes Equity defaulted on its 
promissory note to the district. The district last week began foreclosure 
proceedings to regain title of the property to sell the 30 lots to another 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkart said the current market value of the 30 lots is estimated at $3 
million to $3.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The district originally sold the property for $8.2 million but has received 
only about $3 million, Burkart said. Some of the money was used to help pay for 
the building costs of the new Centralia School in Anaheim, which opened this 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burkart said because the housing development wasn't completed, the 
district has lost out on expected income, because the value of the property 
dropped in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The money from the project was earmarked to make improvements to the 
district's schools in Buena Park, Anaheim and La Palma. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; 2 VACANT BUILDINGS TO HOUSE BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two vacant business buildings on Ball Road will soon be rehabilitated and 
opened as an auto repair shop and convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week gave the owners permission to begin rehabilitating 
the two buildings, which are next to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The new businesses are expected to open within months. The store, M & M 
Market, will be open from 7 a.m. to midnight. It will sell a variety of food 
and beverages. Alcoholic beverages, however, will not be sold there. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto shop, M & M Auto Repair, will offer engine tuneups, oil changes, smog 
testing and brake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that by allowing the businesses to open, the abandoned, 
vacant buildings would get cleaned up and provide another place where city 
residents could service their cars or shop for food. The new businesses will 
also provide sales tax revenue for the city. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; SCHOOL BOARD VOTES 4-1 FOR 4% FEE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westminster School District has approved a 4% increase in residential, 
commercial and industrial development fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved the increase on a 4-1 vote without comment at its regular 
meeting last week.Trustees Sheryl Neugebauer, Ron Morgan, Kathy Stirling 
Iverson and Nancy Blumenthal voted in favor of the increase. Margie Rice 
opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new schedule, designed to adjust for inflation, residential 
development fees will increase from $1.65 to $1.72 per square foot. Fees for 
commercial and industrial development will increase from 27 cents to 28 cents, 
said George Acton, director of financial services. 
</P>
<P>
 Districts charge the fees to help provide classrooms and other school 
facilities for the students whose families move into the developed areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The district receives 61% of those charges. The rest goes to the Huntington 
Beach Union School District. Last year, Westminster School District collected 
about $47,000 in developer fees.

 Leah Dozier, a senior at Tustin High School, was among 350 high school 
students from across the nation who participated in a leadership conference in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In the National Young Leaders conference, which ended earlier this month, the 
students met with leaders from the government, the media and the diplomatic 
corps. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of the conference was "The Leaders of Tomorrow Meeting the Leaders 
of Today." The participants were selected based on leadership and academic 
performance. John Hines, executive director of Congressional Leadership 
Council, a nonprofit group sponsoring the conference, said that it gave young 
people "direct access to Washington leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to meeting national leaders, the students held discussions while 
pretending to be President Clinton and members of the Cabinet trying to solve 
the crisis in the Balkans. They also held a mock congressional debate about the 
national service program. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SCHOOL DRESS CODE SET TO BE APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Anaheim City School District Board of Education gave tentative approval to 
a dress code this week, although one member questioned whether it gives too 
much authority to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Jeanne Blackwell said at this week's meeting that she favors 
banning offensive or obscene clothing, but wondered how that would be defined 
and whether the penalties for violating the code were too strict. 
</P>
<P>
 Penalties range from being forced to change clothes, to confiscation of the 
clothes, to detention and suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little bit worried who will be deciding what is inappropriate, and I 
certainly don't want to see any student expelled from school over something 
like this," Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dress code will prohibit students from wearing baggy pants, T-shirts with 
obscene or offensive messages, hats and other clothing that is "unsafe, 
dangerous or a health hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 The dress code specifically bans any item of clothing that "contains offensive 
or obscene symbols, signs or slogans degrading any culture, religious or ethnic 
values." 
</P>
<P>
 It also prohibits clothing that contains references to sex, drugs, alcohol or 
tobacco, communicates gang affiliations or depicts violence or destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Also prohibited are hats, overalls that are not properly strapped over the 
shoulders and pants that "are not an appropriate size." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has about 17,000 kindergarten through sixth-grade students at 21 
schools in the downtown area. A final decision will be made at the board's 
March 22 meeting. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; LAKE RESTORATION PROPOSAL ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to begin restoring the only three natural lakes in Orange County has 
been forwarded to the county and Laguna Beach for review, a prelude to gaining 
funding that could help pay for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup plan for the three basins, located in Laguna Canyon within the 
Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, was presented Wednesday night at a meeting of the 
Coastal Greenbelt Authority, a group formed to manage the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for cleaning the lakes' algae-ridden waters, uprooting 
invasive shrubbery and replanting natural vegetation to attract migrating 
wildlife. Proponents hope to launch the project by fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can bring back this vegetation and clean up the water, we will get back 
an enormous amount of bird life, much more than we have now," said biologist 
Elisabeth Brown, an authority member who presented the plan to the group of 
about 40 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert G. Fisher, director of the county's harbors, beaches and parks 
division, said that a state grant may be available to help pay for the first 
phase of work and that the county should apply by May if it hopes to secure the 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The county manages the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, a 2,500-acre swath of 
open space at the edge of Laguna Beach that is expected eventually to expand to 
10,000 acres and become the county's largest park. Laguna Beach owns the lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The three ponds, which range in size from 1.5 acres to 12 acres, are suffering 
from a variety of maladies, including soil erosion and water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to revive the lakes under a two-phase, $900,000 plan, and in time 
to allow additional public access to the park, which is now open only one 
weekend per month for docent tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parts of the second phase could be done only if Laguna Canyon Road, which 
borders two of the lakes, is realigned. The lake restoration plan is part of a 
larger, $2.5-million proposal designed by Wetlands Research Associates Inc., a 
San Rafael consulting firm. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY HALL CLOSURE HERALDS NEW HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Hall will be closed today for the first time under a new schedule that 
calls for most city buildings to shut down every other Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The limited hours are among a series of cutbacks approved by the City Council 
earlier this year to help close a projected $4.5-million shortfall in the 
city's fiscal 1994-95 budget.City officials said they are not sure exactly how 
much money the new hours will save. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure will affect most city departments, including community services, 
community development and public works. But the Police Department will remain 
open on Fridays, and city crews will be on call in case emergency work needs to 
be done, City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine joins several other cities, as well as the county, in closing down on 
alternating Fridays. The city sent notices announcing the change to residents 
and others who regularly do business at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said the new hours have the added benefit of getting cars off local 
roads and helping the city comply with smog regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall is open Monday through Thursday from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. On 
alternating Fridays, it is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to approving the new hours, the council has eliminated 71 city 
positions and called for officials to look into privatizing some services.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CULTURAL EXCHANGE IN A LIVING ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat and Ken sat side by side on a living room sofa in Stanton on Wednesday 
night and candidly told six other people how their lives changed after the 
bombing of Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kenneth Inouye, it meant his family would be forced to move from Los 
Angeles to Colorado to avoid being interned in a camp. For Pat Krone, it meant 
her family would benefit by occupying a ranch that had belonged to a 
Japanese-American family imprisoned during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Orange County residents talked about their different cultural 
experiences, poignantly but without bitterness, as part of the county's first 
"Living Room Dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the talks are hoping this will be the first of many such forums 
in which eight to 12 people of different races and cultures come together to 
discuss their life stories. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting in the home of organizer Becky Esparza on Wednesday night, the 
five men and three women discussed the origin of their surnames, the languages 
that are most important to them, their favorite recipes and how their parents 
met. And they talked about both world wars, the Mexican Revolution and the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in Vietnam. All I knew was war. I never knew what peace was," said 
Bonnie Lam, a housing specialist with the city of Santa Ana. Coming to the 
United States in 1975 was like being "born again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said they felt sad that language barriers had separated them from their 
own family.  
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother doesn't speak English," Inouye said. "To this day, I can't 
talk to her. We just smile at each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Chavez, a general manager of a manufacturing plant in Fountain Valley, grew 
up in Norwalk and told the others that as a child he was not allowed to speak 
Spanish in school. And he said that is why he has a moderate command of the 
language of his parents and grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Garden Grove Mayor Pro Tem Ho Chung recognized that the inability 
to speak English left many Koreans open to being misunderstood and hated by 
their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Koreans have very high self-esteem and are slow to learn English because they 
are scared of making a mistake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On our side, we have to change . . . but Americans . . . they have to open 
their hearts and try to listen to us too," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The group members grappled with the degree to which people have to assimilate. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton City Councilman Harry Dotson said he wanted more than anything else to 
understand different cultures, but he is uncomfortable when people use the word 
diversity.  
</P>
<P>
 Holding his hands high and interlacing his fingers in a symbol of unity, he 
said, "I hope we do this. Where nobody is any different from anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley College Prof. Frank Marmolejo said he hoped to foster an 
alternative notion of unity, where differences are recognized and celebrated 
and people are not asked to abandon parts of their culture to be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 The dialogues are sponsored by the Orange County Human Relations Commission 
and Orange County Together, an organization formed after the Los Angeles riots 
to promote cultural understanding and tolerance in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Four dialogues are scheduled in the next month, and 40 more people have 
volunteered to host talks in their homes, said Orange County Together executive 
director Pat Calahan. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; EARTH FIRST! ACTIVIST PROTESTS 
ROADWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Earth First! activist remained atop a platform halfway up a 200-foot crane 
at the Foothill toll road construction site Thursday night, vowing to remain 
there for five days to protest the road project. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies surrounded the spot Thursday morning and did not allow 
other activists near the work site high above O'Neill Regional Park.An officer 
said there were no immediate plans to attempt to bring down the man, identified 
as Craig Beneville. 
</P>
<P>
 Earth First! spokesman Patrick Mitchell said Beneville plans to remain on the 
platform for at least five days. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was the second time in a little more than a month that Earth First! 
activists disrupted operations at the construction site. On Sept. 27, they also 
disrupted work at the San Joaquin Hills tollway in Laguna Niguel by chaining 
themselves to bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Telles, spokeswoman for the Transportation Corridor Agencies, the agency 
in charge of toll road construction in the county, said the only impact the 
activists had was to prevent workers from using the crane. 
</P>
<P>
 "But (they) have not stopped any of the operations there. The construction 
schedule has not been impacted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In pre-dawn hours, members of the group, which is opposed to the construction 
of all tollways in the county, hoisted a 3-by-6-foot wooden platform to the 
halfway point of the 200-foot crane, attached it to the equipment and posted 
Beneville there. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said the platform has been rigged in a such a way that if workers or 
authorities try to move the crane, Beneville would fall 100 feet to the ground. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We have upped the ante," Mitchell said, "but it is required."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; FAMILY ROBBED IN HOME INVASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three robbers identifying themselves as police officers forced their way into 
a home Thursday morning and held family members and visitors at gunpoint as 
they ransacked the home. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third home-invasion robbery this week in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery occurred at 11:50 a.m. in the 23000 block of Cavanaugh Road, 
Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said.  
</P>
<P>
 Three men came to the door and, identifying themselves in Spanish as police 
officers, demanded entry, Martini said. One of them held a gun to the head of 
one male victim and ordered all nine family members, some of whom were in other 
rooms at the time, to lie on the living room floor face down, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three friends who unwittingly stopped by for a visit during the robbery also 
were forced to lie on the floor, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 While one robber held the victims at gunpoint, the others ransacked the home, 
taking cash and jewelry. It is unknown if they fled in a car.  
</P>
<P>
 No one in the house, ranging from children to senior citizens, was injured.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, two families were terrorized by armed robbers who burst 
into their homes in Santa Ana and Westminster. Police arrived during the Santa 
Ana robbery and arrested three men, but the gunmen in the Westminster robbery 
remained at large. No one was injured in those attacks. ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; CASPERS PARK SEEKS TREE PLANTING HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They have the trees, now they need hands to plant them. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 live oak saplings will be planted near Ronald W. Caspers 
Regional Park on Saturday to help salve the damage caused by last year's 
firestorm that burned several thousand acres of open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree planting will take place from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Groups and 
individuals interested in volunteering should contact the park at (714) 
831-2174. Caspers park is off Ortega Highway, about 7 1/2 miles east of 
Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The oak trees and a watering trailer were donated by Chevron Petroleum Oil 
Technology. The oil company owns the nearby Coto de Caza development just north 
of Caspers park, and 50 Chevron employees will be volunteering. 
</P>
<P>
 Also helping will be the participants in the county's Adopt-A-Park program. 
Park volunteers pitch in all year with trail maintenance, litter pickup and 
many other activities. Countywide, volunteers in the program save the parks 
system about $1 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 People who plan to come Saturday are asked to bring a round-point shovel, 
sunscreen lotion, a hat and sunglasses. Drinking water, gloves and a light 
breakfast and lunch will be provided by park rangers.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; EDUCATION OFFICIAL TO SEEK BOSS' JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The head of one of Orange County's vocational education programs filed papers 
Thursday to run against his boss for Orange County superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Opp, 53, a Laguna Beach resident who has been chief educational 
officer of the Central County Regional Occupation Program for the last eight 
years, criticized Supt. John F. Dean for not cutting the budget or the staff 
enough during his four-year term. He also called on the department to place a 
greater emphasis on job training for youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there needs to be a change," Opp said in an interview Thursday. "The 
Orange County Department of Education ought to be a leader in the economic 
recovery of this county, and I'm not seeing that in this leadership. Leadership 
should be assisting the school districts in areas of weakness, and that area of 
weakness is job training." 
</P>
<P>
 With a $70-million budget and more than 1,000 employees, the Department of 
Education does not oversee local schools but provides services to the 27 school 
districts in Orange County. The department also collects data for the state, 
runs special education programs and offers alternative schools for juvenile 
delinquents and expelled students. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonpartisan election is June 7. Dean and Opp are the only official 
candidates so far. Today is the filing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dean, 67, a former Whittier College professor who was elected to the post 
in 1990, Opp's candidacy is akin to a slap in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happened to trust and confidence in one's employees. . . . He 
reports to me! We have managers who are supposed to bring me solutions, not 
problems," Dean said Thursday. "If he's been this concerned about things, why 
didn't he tell me? That's what we pay our managers for, to bring problems and 
propose solutions so we can do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Opp said his decision to run for the post, which serves as a figurehead 
for the county education Establishment, is more about himself than about Dean. 
He said he will give priority to job training, business-school partnerships and 
adopting "common sense" curricula. 
</P>
<P>
 Opp grew up in Santa Ana, graduating from Santa Ana High in 1958, and has 
lived in Laguna Beach since 1975. He earned a bachelor's degree in geography 
from Cal State Long Beach and a master's in educational administration from 
Pepperdine Univeristy. Previously, he worked at the Orange and Garden Grove 
unified school districts and in private industry. 
</P>
<P>
 During his first year on the job, Opp promised, he would conduct a department 
audit with an eye toward trimming the bureaucracy. JODI WILGOREN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TWO MEN ARRESTED IN SHOOTING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two reputed gang members have been arrested in connection with the shooting 
death of a 20-year-old Long Beach man who was killed during a confrontation 
this week, Santa Ana police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-day investigation, members of the Police Department's gang unit 
arrested 20-year-old Ezekiel Mugica Rivera of Orange and 18-year-old Alex Nava 
of Santa Ana at their homes Wednesday evening, Lt. Robert Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Gamaliel Serrano, was shot and killed just after midnight Monday 
in the 1500 block of South Bristol Street during "cruising night," a time when 
the street is heavily traveled by young people showing off their cars, Helton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano, whose friends told police he was a member of a Compton gang, was hit 
in the upper body by a single gunshot fired from a car that pulled up alongside 
the one he was riding in, Helton said. Serrano died before reaching the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both cars were cruising on Bristol when an argument broke out and there was 
some yelling back and forth between occupants of both vehicles," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour after the shooting, police arrested a 15-year-old from Santa Ana 
while investigating a burglary. The juvenile, who police believe is also a gang 
member, had a semiautomatic handgun that police later identified as the weapon 
used in the Serrano shooting, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old, whose name has not been released, is being held at Orange 
County Juvenile Hall on suspicion of illegally possessing the weapon and may 
face additional charges, police said. Police declined to say why the juvenile 
has not been arrested in connection with Serrano's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera and Nava -- who told police they are gang members, Helton said -- are 
being held at the Santa Ana Jail on suspicion of murder. Their bail has been 
set at $250,000 each. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; L.A. MAYOR HONORED BY URBAN LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Urban League will honor prominent Americans at its 11th 
annual Awards Banquet today at the Irvine Marriott hotel. Among the honorees 
are former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and musician Benny Carter, said league 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the dinner, which begins at 6:30 p.m., will go to support the 
league's employment-placement and education programs, as well as to create a 
new business-skills training center for minorities, said league President and 
Chief Executive Officer George Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The keynote speaker will be Ray Watson, vice chairman of the Irvine Co. 
According to a league statement, Watson "will offer his thoughts and vision 
about the changing nature of communities in this century." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson was the first manager of planning for the Irvine Co., which is 
developing one of the largest urban environment master plans in the country, 
according to the league. Watson was the company's president and CEO from 1973 
to 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, who served five terms as mayor of America's second largest city, will 
receive the Whitney M. Young Jr. Award in recognition of his leadership, his 
efforts to improve race relations and years of public service, according to the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual awards dinner is the Urban League's major fund-raiser for the year.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SCHOOL BOARD OKS CLOSURE OF FARM

 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District board voted unanimously this week to 
eliminate the Costa Mesa Farm Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the seven board members hinted that the farm, which has been a 
part of the district since the 1930s, was not generating enough student 
participation and could not justify the $110,000 in annual expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, the board reluctantly voted to close the farm June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason we hate to close it is because these are the last ties we have to 
the old Orange County," board member Roderick H. MacMillian said. The farm "has 
had a great history." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have to decide what to do with the 20 acres of farmland, pens 
and stables for animals and a greenhouse. No students or parents came to the 
meeting to protest the move. BOB ELSTON

BOY, 14, CHARGED WITH MURDER IN FOOTBALL STAR'S SLAYING; VIOLENCE: 
MISUNDERSTANDING OVER A DUNE BUGGY PRECEDED THE STABBING. YOUTH WILL BE TRIED 
AS A JUVENILE.

<P>
 A 14-year-old boy was charged with murder Thursday in connection with the 
fatal stabbing of Rancho Alamitos High School star running back Moukda 
Chounlamany, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Molko, who is handling the case, declined to discuss 
the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing was scheduled today in Orange County Juvenile Court in Orange. 
Because of the suspect's age, he will be tried as a juvenile. Under state law, 
prosecutors can only seek to try defendants ages 16 and older as adults, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials did not release the teen-ager's name because he is a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, who is being held at Orange County Juvenile Hall, is a high 
school dropout from Riverside who lives with his grandfather in Garden Grove, 
said Police Sgt. Doug Morrill. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrill described the attack, which occurred during a misunderstanding over a 
dune buggy, as "one of the worst stabbings I have ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Police released more details of the attack. Chounlamany, 18, bled to death 
from a stab wound to his chest that was 3 1/4 inches long and 2 1/2 inches 
wide. He was stabbed once in the chest with a large Army-style knife and died 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old was arrested several hours after the attack, which occurred 
about 9 p.m. Tuesday in the 12700 block of Louise Street. He initially fled but 
returned several hours later and turned himself over to police, Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had run away from the area and went to a relative's house," Morrill said. 
"Relatives of the suspect brought him back to the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation began earlier in the evening when the victim's younger 
brother and some friends who live in an apartment complex on Louise Street were 
congregating around the dune buggy, Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspect believed there was going to be a vehicle theft or a theft from 
the vehicle and ran out to confront the guys," Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group left but returned a short time later in a vehicle driven by 
Chounlamany. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went back to the apartment complex to drop off some friends who live 
there and, as they drove up, they were confronted by the suspect," Morrill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chounlamany was stabbed as he got out of his vehicle, Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood remained somber at Rancho Alamitos High, where flags flew at half 
staff in honor of the slain teen-ager. A message on the school's marquee read: 
"We Love You Moukda." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are kids crying in the hall," Vice Principal Connie Van Luit said. 
"There's still a lot of sadness."

CHURCH OFFICIAL SAYS ACCUSED CHILD MOLESTER CONFESSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The church youth group leader charged this week with molesting four young boys 
confessed to leaders of the First Evangelical Free Church in Fullerton two 
months ago and was stripped of his volunteer job working with youngsters, a 
church spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Webb Blinkhorn, 29, admitted to church officials Jan. 19 that he had 
molested young parishioners after a youth on a church retreat complained to 
another counselor, said church spokesman Jac La Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinkhorn was dismissed "after confessing to molesting and engaging in 
inappropriate sexual activity with four junior high-age boys," according to a 
statement issued by the church. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being removed from the youth group, Blinkhorn was advised to 
seek counseling and asked to stay away from the church, La Tour said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church staff informed the parents of the alleged victims, none of whom 
were in Blinkhorn's youth group, and reported Blinkhorn to county social 
service workers, La Tour said. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia police then conducted a monthlong investigation of the charges, 
which involved three boys from Fullerton and one from Anaheim, said Placentia 
police spokeswoman Corrine Loomis. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to vacate his apartment by his roommates, Blinkhorn left the area and 
was most likely living in Reseda until he turned himself in to police Tuesday 
after a warrant was issued for his arrest, a Placentia investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being held in the Orange County Jail in lieu of $75,000 bond, charged 
with 18 felony counts of lewd conduct with children, she said. Blinkhorn will 
be arraigned Wednesday in Municipal Court in Fullerton and could face up to 30 
years in prison if convicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges mark the second time allegations of sexual misconduct have arisen 
at the church. In 1992, church elder James C. Truxton resigned after admitting 
he molested several young female church members. 
</P>
<P>
 For four years, Blinkhorn spent six to eight hours a week with a group of 
about 10 boys, helping help them with Bible study on Wednesday nights and 
leading a Sunday morning youth program. Blinkhorn underwent a church screening 
process before he was allowed to become a volunteer, La Tour said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinkhorn molested the youths, ranging in age from 12 and 15, in his home 
between January, 1991, and July, 1993, Loomis said.  
</P>
<P>
 Blinkhorn moved to a room in a Placentia home in August, 1993, and lived there 
until about seven weeks ago, his former roommate said Thursday. Blinkhorn 
admitted the molestations to his two roommates about the same time he 
acknowledged the offenses to church staff, said the roommate, who asked not to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike told us what happened and we said, 'It's time for you to leave now. We 
don't want you here anymore.' And he was gone that weekend," the roommate said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 While living in the Placentia house, Blinkhorn frequently brought home members 
of his youth group for Bible study meetings, the roommate said, adding that 
Blinkhorn denied molesting them there.  
</P>
<P>
 "He got along with (the youths in his group) really well. He was basically a 
kid at heart" and a devout Christian, he added.  
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed remorseful and knew that it was wrong. He said he needed help. I 
could see he was distraught. I didn't see him shed tears . . . but I'm sure he 
probably did on his own." 
</P>
<P>
 The church has encouraged Blinkhorn's alleged victims and their families to 
seek counseling and has arranged for a church staff person to make referrals to 
community family counselors, La Tour said.

'FALSE FACTS' USED TO PIN DEATH ON RAPIST, JURY IS TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E. J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors are "testing a neat new murder theory" with "false 
facts" in the case of an admitted rapist charged with killing a 79-year-old 
woman who died a month after the attack, a defense attorney told a jury 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia said the prosecution failed to prove any 
connection between the rape of 79-year-old Mary Ward and her death a month 
later from heart and kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Gumlia said, the district attorney overwhelmed jurors with the horror 
of the rape by repeatedly playing Ward's frantic 911 call, relied on testimony 
of doctors who had no knowledge of Ward's medical history, and then "glossed 
over" the specifics of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a big gap in their case," Gumlia told a Superior Court jury during 
closing arguments Thursday. "Though it's very seductive to say the attack set 
certain forces in motion, it's too much of a leap of faith."  
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia represents Jose Alonso Garcia, 20, a dishwasher from Stanton, who is 
charged with murder, rape and four other sexual assault charges. Jurors in the 
case began deliberating Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia has maintained that the assault did not cause Ward's death and that she 
was ill with lung cancer and other medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. David R. LaBahn, has argued that the attack 
killed Ward's spirit and hastened her death. LaBahn said that before the attack 
in May, 1992, Ward was a "feisty and energetic" woman who loved her friends and 
her church, but became despondent and lost her will to live after the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBahn said that Ward's health was improving, and she would have lived longer 
had she not been traumatized by the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBahn called on testimony from six physicians, psychologists and 
psychiatrists who said there is a connection between the mind and the body, and 
that a person who loses interest in living often dies sooner than someone with 
a positive outlook on life. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Gumlia dismissed such evidence as unproven and still not accepted 
by the mainstream medical community. Gumlia also blasted several of LaBahn's 
medical experts who he said had never examined Ward, nor had a thorough 
understanding of her ailments.

CAFE LIDO CLOSES ON A QUIET NOTE; JAZZ: THE BALBOA PENINSULA CLUB OWNER CITES 
THE ECONOMY AND SHIFTING MUSICAL TASTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the short-lived world of nightclubs, Cafe Lido had a life like 
Methuselah's. For 14 years on the Balboa Peninsula, the handsome supper club 
was one of Orange County's last bastions of straight-ahead jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 But no more. Last month, the Lido shut its doors, a victim, says owner Joe 
Sperrazza, not just of current economic conditions but of shifting musical 
tastes, declining alcohol sales and other changes in ways that the public 
spends its entertainment dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest and certainly the most unsettling in a series of local jazz club 
failures, "it's a profound loss," says trumpeter Ron Stout, who held Sunday 
afternoon jam sessions there. "It's almost too hard to face." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just jazz rooms that are closing. Bogart's, the club in Long Beach 
that had been the hub of the local grass-roots rock scene, closed in December. 
The Rhythm Cafe in Santa Ana folded a year ago in the face of mounting losses, 
ending an ambitious but brief attempt to present high-profile musicians from 
many fields. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, in Orange County and nationally, clubs tend to come and go at 
an almost seasonal pace. But in Orange County, for the past several months, 
jazz clubs have been closing far more rapidly than usual. And while rock clubs 
in the county have been replaced by new ones -- the no-frills Electric Circus 
in Anaheim, Our House in Costa Mesa and Club 369 in Fullerton all have sprung 
up recently, offering local bands at low admission prices -- no new jazz clubs 
have come along. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lido was the last jazz club here that anyone expected to close. Located on 
30th Street since 1988, and on Newport Boulevard before that, it was "was the 
No. 1 jazz spot in Orange County," says Dee Dee McNeil, a former Motown 
songwriter who had been a fixture there on weekends. "Its passing is going to 
be a real loss for the music and musicians as well as the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 "Things had been tough for the last two years, but we thought it would turn 
around eventually," said Sperrazza, a trumpeter who on rare occasions was known 
to join the musicians on his bandstand. 
</P>
<P>
 Sperrazza, who closed the club on Feb. 27, said he's not necessarily finished 
with the business. "We're going to relax a couple weeks, play some golf and 
then start looking for a new place. We're optimistic that in a year we'll have 
another location." 
</P>
<P>
 But "there are so many expenses that don't contribute anything to the 
business, like ASCAP and BMI fees (royalties for the use of particular pieces 
of music), worker's comp charges and the various licensing fees from the city. 
We had to pay all those whether we were full or empty. They weren't a lot by 
themselves, but it all added up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, the current trend in drinking less, with sobriety checkpoints and all, 
and people drinking wine instead of cocktails. Let's face it, this is a whiskey 
business, and the times were changing." 
</P>
<P>
 He attempted to change with them -- offering wine tastings with dinner, 
featuring happy hour prices on appetizers rather than drinks, even adding a few 
rhythm & blues bands to the lineup -- but such efforts failed to do the trick.  
</P>
<P>
 "And our neighborhood has become less desirable," he added. "At one time, 
people used to walk from place to place down here. But there aren't so many 
places to go to now." 
</P>
<P>
 Mucho Gusto, a restaurant in Costa Mesa that offered fusion, Brazilian and 
Latin jazz, closed in January. The month before, Vinnie's Ristorante, almost 
across the street from Mucho Gusto, stopped booking jazz; owner Vincent 
Colandrea's Laguna Niguel club closed the previous September. That summer, the 
music stopped at Maxwell's in Huntington Beach, which had been presenting such 
respected names as saxophonist Teddy Edwards and pianist Cedar Walton. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't part of a national trend, according to bassist Luther Hughes, who 
booked jazz into Vinnie's. Hughes says he sees busy clubs as he travels the 
country with pianist Gene Harris' quartet. "It isn't jazz that's dying. We 
played a weeklong engagement at the Jazz Alley in Seattle recently, and the 
club was packed every night." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the jazz scene is dead by a long shot," agrees Randell Young, 
whose club, Randell's in Santa Ana, is one of the few jazz rooms in Orange 
County that is doing well. "Our business has picked up steadily since we opened 
in 1992," said Young, noting that his February attendance surged ahead of 
expectations, leaving him shorthanded at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bring in different audiences, the straight-ahead fans, the fusion fans, 
the funk fans on different nights. And we expose people to different kinds of 
music that way," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these places (that closed) had poor sound systems, rinky-dink 
lighting and the kitchen door swinging open all the time right next to the 
bandstand. That just isn't very good presentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Others -- including Frank Amoss, president of the Orange County Musicians' 
Assn. Local 7, American Federation of Musicians -- say the declining number of 
jazz clubs is a reflection that "the audience for jazz is disappearing. The 
people who are coming of age now were reared on electric rock 'n' roll. They 
never had the chance to develop an appreciation for jazz. Therefore, they don't 
support it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Phebus presents all sorts of popular music as concert director of the 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, by far Orange County's most successful 
club, and he estimates that attendance at jazz events is down 20% to 30% from a 
few years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 He noted that he had to cancel one of two shows last fall by Joshua Redman, 
one of the hottest young jazz musicians in the country, because of inadequate 
ticket sales. "I'm a jazz fan and would like to say that it's because of the 
economy, but that's not the case. Our other shows continue to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 In its heyday, the Lido offered music six nights a week, and such acts as 
pianist-singer Mose Allison, the Four Freshmen and Poncho Sanchez's Latin jazz 
band played on Sunday afternoons. Perhaps the club's finest moment came in 1987 
when the Cafe Lido All Stars -- led by saxophonist Wayne Wayne, a club stalwart 
since its earliest days -- went all the way to the Final Four in the Hennessy 
Cognac Jazz Search. The competition is an annual nationwide battle of jazz 
bands that rewards the winner with the opening spot at the Hollywood Bowl's 
Playboy Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Wayne credited the club and Sperrazza with the band's success. 
"We were a working band," he explained. "We played together four nights a week, 
every week. We were ready." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne was the backbone of the club in those days," recalls Sperrazza. "He 
probably worked harder to keep jazz flowing here than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpeter Stout credits Sperrazza. "He was never anything but terrific to us," 
Stout said. He is "a real true friend of jazz. It's rare to have the kind of 
rapport with a club owner that we had with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sperrazza admits to getting "choked up" on the club's last day but said not 
all of his feelings are sad ones. "I'm walking away happy, really," he 
explained. "I've worked with so many wonderful people over 14 years. And we had 
such wonderful music."

IRISH 'MUTTS' HARBOR FULL-BLOODED LOVE OF GENRE; MUSIC: CAISLEAN, A TRIO FROM 
ATLANTA, BRINGS ITS 'LUCRATIVE HOBBY' OF TRADITIONAL FARE TO THE SAN JUAN 
CAPISTRANO LIBRARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 So how does a construction inspector for the city of Atlanta, who used to be a 
blues musician, find himself playing fiddle in an Irish traditional band? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a spiritual experience following an Elvis sighting," explained John 
Westerfield, a member of Caislean, a trio that plays the San Juan Capistrano 
Library tonight at 7 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting serious just for a moment, Westerfield said he fell in love with Irish 
music the first time he heard it on the radio. "I had never known what real 
traditional Irish music was until sometime in the mid-'70s," he recalled on the 
phone from his home in Georgia. "Ever since then, I've been pursuing it." 
</P>
<P>
 A guitarist since the late '60s, he got his first fiddle 10 years ago and 
formed a band called Celti Ceili with some like-minded Georgians. The group 
released two albums and played numerous folk and Irish festivals around the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Caislean (pronounced koshlun; it is the Irish word for castle) is a 
stripped-down version of the earlier band, with Whit Wright on guitar, 
bouzouki, bodhran (an Irish drum) and vocals, and Susan Clearman on accordion. 
They draw on numerous Celtic styles and forms from as far back as the 18th 
Century, including airs, ballads, jigs and reels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Westerfield said the band members are driven more by a love of the music than 
by any personal connections or Irish roots. "I think we're mostly mutts. I know 
I am," he said, noting that as far as he knows, his ancestry includes Germans 
and Scots as well as Irishmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Celtic and Teutonic," he said. "I like to get drunk and obey orders." 
</P>
<P>
 Caislean plays festivals throughout the year, but March is the big touring 
season. "St. Paddy's Day is the big bread-and-butter time for us," Westerfield 
said. The feast-and-famine nature of the Irish music business means that he 
needs to keep his day job, but he said that only makes the music all the more 
enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music's not like work. It's more or less a lucrative hobby for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on the Irish music front, popular local group Paddy West returns to 
Orange Coast College on Saturday for its 13th annual St. Patrick's Day 
celebration. The traditional group features George Cavanaugh, Mark Romano and 
Mary Kelly, who play a variety of instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caislean plays tonight at 7 and 9 at the San Juan Capistrano Library, 31495 
El Camino Real, San Juan Capistrano. $3. (714) 493-1752. Paddy West plays 
Saturday at 8 p.m. in the Fine Arts Recital Hall at Orange Coast College, 2701 
Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. $9-$11. (714) 432-5880.

 Rob Mullins, the keyboardist who's been a steady fixture at Southern 
California jazz clubs for close to a decade, says the primary responsibility of 
a musician is to reach his audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think too much of the time, jazz musicians don't consider who's out there 
listening," says Mullins, who lives in Huntington Beach. "After all, they're 
the ones that make your house payments. And, let's face it: Music is 
entertainment. If people aren't entertained, you haven't accomplished 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Mullins plays strictly for his fans. He's also moved by the personal 
gratification that comes from expressing himself creatively, and the 
opportunity the stage provides for making social and political statements. "So, 
for me, it's those things, combined with making the audience happy," he says. 
"I always try to put on a show that makes the audience feel included." 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins appears with his solid quartet -- featuring Crusaders saxman Wilton 
Felder and drummer Ndugu Chancler -- tonight and Saturday at the Room Upstairs 
at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks. One way he'll get his audience involved in his 
performance is to offer such contemporary-flavored, R&B/jazz-oriented songs as 
"Polka Dot Dress" and "One Night in Houston," numbers that are driven by a 
dynamic backbeat pulse provided by Chancler. 
</P>
<P>
 These are selections Mullins loosely groups under the rubric of "groove" 
tunes. He describes the style: 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically the groove is about creating a certain feeling," he says. "It 
doesn't have anything to do with how many notes you play, or how fast. It's 
about how the players in the band play together to create a vibe." 
</P>
<P>
 Vibe?  
</P>
<P>
 "That's playing the specific parts with the correct attitude in each song, 
which will always be different," he says. "When it's done right, and the band 
is creating a feeling, and the crowd is responding, it makes you happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins points out that jazz music influenced by contemporary R&B, as 
exemplified by such artists as the Crusaders, Kenny G and Fourplay, has long 
been more popular than mainstream-based, straight-ahead jazz -- the kind played 
by pianist Oscar Peterson, the Count Basie band and the Modern Jazz Quartet. 
The keyboardist feels the reason for the disparity is the difference in the 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the straight-ahead music, the beat is more implied, more disguised," he 
says. "But in groove-oriented music, there's no question as to where the beat 
is. That's why it's more popular. That doesn't make groove-oriented music 
better. It's just different." 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins has played Le Cafe on several occasions, and owner Dale Jaffe says the 
keyboardist always makes good on his promise to please the audience. "Rob has 
great energy, and he and the wonderful people he brings with him excite the 
crowd," Jaffe says. 
</P>

 Born in Enid, Okla., raised in Ontario, Calif., and Denver, Mullins was 
initially a drummer, then took up piano at age 14 after a freak accident left 
him with a broken leg. After moving to Southern California in the mid-'80s, he 
established himself as a jazz musician with an ear for the public's taste with 
such albums as "Tokyo Nights" and the recent "One Night in Houston." 
</P>
<P>
 Though mostly heard in the Southland, Mullins has traveled to Japan, Europe, 
and last December to Hanoi to perform. The appearance, held New Year's Eve at 
the 750-seat Hanoi Opera House, built in 1911 by the French government, was 
titled "Playing for Peace" and was sponsored by a Colorado family who Mullins 
knows with cultural ties to the Vietnam government. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a unique and exciting opportunity," says Mullins, who, in addition to 
his performance, conducted some clinics at the Hanoi Music Conservatory. "It 
was personally very gratifying to see the enjoyment on the people's faces when 
they heard American jazz. They sometimes got so excited, they'd give me 
ovations in the middle of songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins says his Vietnamese trip will bear fruit in terms of new music. "When 
I went to Japan in 1990, my "Tokyo Nights" album came out of that experience," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'll be working with traditional Vietnamese musical sounds. I like 
incorporating new sounds, new ideas. All this music of the world is influencing 
jazz artists, and I think that's what's exciting about the future."

HAUNTED BY MORTALITY; 'CUT FLOWERS,' A DARK VIEW OF A HEDONISTIC GENERATION, 
DRAMATIZES THE UNDOING OF BEST-LAID PLANS. IT COMES FROM PLAYWRIGHT SAGE 
ALLEN'S OWN DIFFICULT PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes regularly about 
theater for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 "It was a troubling . . . strenuous . . . time." 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Sage Allen sums up her emotion-wracked years from 1984 to 1988 -- 
years when she didn't write one play, years when one loved one after another 
was dying -- with a short pause between each word. They come with a sigh, as if 
a great weight was upon her, then lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "But of course," she adds, "the play comes from those years." 
</P>
<P>
 The play is "Cut Flowers," now at the Victory Theatre, and it amounts to a 
dark summation of the bitter fruits of the '60s. Both Allen and co-stars Salome 
Jens and Joanna Miles admit, with a slight catch in the throat, that the play 
exposes something deeply wrong with the 1960s' spirit of hedonistic liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to think that the title," says Allen, "refers to Devon and Katy," 
her central characters (played by Miles and Jens, respectively), who are, like 
Allen and her actresses, in their 50s. The passing of life is pressing down on 
these women, perhaps especially Katy, a fading actress who might be thought of 
as a Barbara Hershey without the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Jamie, Katy's son, is also cut, cut off in his youth by drugs and 
aimlessness," says Allen. This, she insists, is far from a mere lament for 
aging boomers. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time," she adds, "I purposely made both sons messed up, so that 
even though Devon's son Skeet had the kind of strong and loving father Jamie 
lacked, he still ended up an alcoholic. Skeet may now seem on the rebound, but 
he's still capable of falling, still a hustler." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which means, in Allen's view, that the presence or absence of a father 
can't by itself explain the violent anomie afflicting so many of today's youth 
-- the byproduct of a now-regretful Love Generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen sets her mortality-haunted drama where she lives, in Studio City, "where 
I can hear gunshots some nights" and where, shortly after the Jan. 17 
earthquake, a couple in a nearby home were found slain. "We don't hear about 
middle-class troubles, but when I consider a dozen friends of mine, most of 
whom have had kids who've been in jail or run away or died, and that they were 
given all of life's advantages and still end up lost or worse . . . I just 
don't get it. What happened to them?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Cut Flowers," written in 1988 originally as a one-act for the Ensemble Studio 
Theatre, is Allen's way of exploring, if not answering, that question. But if 
it's also somewhat autobiographical, Jens is a bit more direct on that point 
than the author. "Devon is Sage, absolutely, a creative woman whose life has 
really been up and down." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was born deep in the heart of the Texas Panhandle, in Pampa, "where the 
oil money provided a lot of theater and culture." After her family moved to 
Austin, Allen attended the University of Texas, but she yearned for the New 
York theater nexus of the '50s and transferred to Columbia. However, with her 
mother suffering from cancer, Allen felt the pull back to Texas -- the first of 
several times in her life when family ties pulled her away from professional 
passions. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she did return to New York and began singing with the society orchestra 
led by Lester Lanin, to whom she was married for five years. "Lester was much 
older. I was immature, and it couldn't last," she recalls. Once again, back in 
Texas, Allen married her college sweetheart: "It was meant to be, I think, 
since Barry had also just divorced. It was a big change, since Lester's world 
of celebrities and royalty was a totally different pot of paint from Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry's architecture career took them back to New York, where Allen became 
involved with both the Actors' Studio -- artistic home of Jens and Miles -- and 
a hotbed for new plays, the American Place Theatre. But when Barry's work took 
him to Florida and Allen felt cut off from theater, "I sort of did my own 
thing, the way a lot of women in the '70s did, and came out alone to California 
and connected with theater here." 
</P>
<P>
 She was hit by another shock when Barry suffered a heart attack, but soon he 
came with her back to California, where Allen determined that she could write 
plays -- "and I decided to start with the next thing that happened to me, which 
was a wrong number." 
</P>
<P>
 The wrong number became "Mobile Home" (1980), followed two years later by the 
Orwellian "Bigtime Boogie," directed by revered experimental filmmaker Shirley 
Clarke. Again, real life intruded: Barry died in 1984, and Allen's mother died 
the following year. "I was emotionally wrung out," Allen says, "but I think in 
the end, the writing is better for everything I've gone through." 
</P>
<P>
 Jens and Miles did the first reading of "Cut Flowers" at the Lee Strasberg 
Center's Playwrights Unit workshop, and in an uncommon act of dedication, 
helped see it through to a full production. Jens says it was Miles who "nudged 
and pushed us" to produce the play, but it was Jens who urged Jules Aaron to 
direct. 
</P>
<P>
 "This play's a wake-up call," says Jens. "It's saying that this society is in 
trouble."

GETTING HIT OVER THE HEAD; JAMES KENNEDY'S WILD 'SLOW DEATH' IS AS BOMBASTIC 
FOR THE AUDIENCE AS IT IS BRUTAL TO THE CHARACTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 One thing about the San Fernando Valley's newest resident artistic director, 
playwright James Kennedy: His jackhammer theatrical style drives critics crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, who recently took over the former Gnu Theater and transformed it into 
the Odessa Theatre, has been outraging theater reviewers for 20 years with 
overripe, bombastic plays. Audiences don't seem to mind as much as his dismayed 
critics, give or take a few who have lauded his unpredictability. One thing is 
for sure: Nobody ever dismisses Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 These ruminations were prompted by Kennedy's raw, bus-prisoner drama, "Slow 
Death," which is set in the desert. It's being staged simultaneously with "The 
Session," Kennedy's diametrically different play about a celebrity photographer 
shooting beautiful women. 
</P>
<P>
 (Kennedy and co-artistic director Reese Howard have outfitted the Odessa with 
refinished 70-year-old chairs that are arguably the most comfortable seats in 
Greater L.A. small theater.) 
</P>
<P>
 As an old Kennedy-watcher (from his earliest play, "Winners Circle" -- in 
which critics in the front row were inadvertently sprayed with gobs of mud 
standing in for fecal matter -- to the Howard Hughes-themed "Dogfight" to the 
Van Gogh-themed "Mad Vincent"), I am happy to report that this enfant terrible 
is still marching to the same muse, playing by his own rules and, once again, 
driving patrons to the edge of their patience. 
</P>
<P>
 In the literary parlance of the novelist Thomas Wolfe, dramatist Kennedy is a 
putter-inner, not a taker-outer. Subtlety is a foreign substance. He's never 
met an emotion he doesn't like and won't dramatize, which is both the bane and 
surprise of "Slow Death." 
</P>
<P>
 The title describes the ordeal of four prisoners chained together inside a 
prison bus manned by a deputy sheriff from hell (the demented Mark Harris). 
Unaccountably steering his charges into the desert and onto a remote bombing 
range, the guard turns out to be a mad avenging angel who strips to his shorts, 
smears his body with blood and dances, in genuinely nutty, comic scenes, to 
show tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time the deputy verbally and physically torments the prisoners, 
who are a varied lot, even as each predictably undergoes a histrionic epiphany 
under the boiling sun.  
</P>
<P>
 Rattling their chains, still in their civvies, the prisoners are emissaries of 
life's big con reduced to animalism. The acting is generally hyper with the 
exception of Perry Moore's silken black dude, who, as the play's most 
mysterious character, is its most interesting. In contrast are J. Bartell's 
snarly killer, Philip Sokoloff's amusing, hyperventilating latent pedophile and 
the quartet's nominal guy next door (Brad Henson and his all-American mug), who 
invokes encounters with women from his past (Elise Allen and Ginger Marin). 
</P>
<P>
 Underneath its shrillness (the crazed deputy almost suffocates the play), the 
production is a metaphor for a spiritual wasteland, albeit laid on with a 
trowel. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a theme is symbolized by the prisoners in chains, a brain-fevered desert 
rat (James Andrew Oster) who materializes as if from a rock, railing against 
society's destruction of nature, and finally, the empty, burnished landscape 
(rendered by lighting designer Gregory Santana's hot colors and director/set 
designer Reese Howard's cut-away bus frame, inside of which, facing the house 
all in a row, sit the surly prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy abhors minimalism, discretion, tight focus and a lean, clean style and 
opts, characteristically, for the big moment, the operatic passion and 
visceral, messy stage business. In contrast, he calls "The Session" a party.

SHARING A LOVE FOR THE STAGE; DIRECTING DRAMAS IS NOT A LONELY JOB FOR GEOFF 
ELLIOTT. HE DIVIDES THE WORK WITH HIS WIFE, JULIA RODRIGUEZ ELLIOTT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Geoff Elliott and Julia Rodriguez Elliott aren't exactly joined at the hip -- 
but sometimes it seems that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our particular case, it works out fabulously," says Geoff Elliott. He and 
his wife are joint artistic directors at A Noise Within, where they have staged 
a revival of Arthur Miller's "All My Sons" (1946), which opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think alike; as directors, we have the same vocabulary. We're able to go 
home after rehearsal and talk about it, hope we both saw the same things. 
Usually, directing is a lonely, lonely thing -- and the person at the helm is 
expected to have all the answers. With two people, you don't have that kind of 
pressure," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair -- who last year co-directed an acclaimed production of Thornton 
Wilder's "Our Town" at the theater -- are equally passionate in their praise 
for Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Julia and I consider him one of the premiere American playwrights," says 
Geoff, who also plays the small role of next-door neighbor Doc Bayless in the 
production. "This story deals with ageless issues: family, blood being thicker 
than water, family ties that bind, guilt, lack of guilt, hoping those you love 
lack guilt, our responsibility to ourselves and to our immediate family -- and 
to the family of man and woman. It's very relevant to our daily lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The story centers on the Keller family, post-World War II. "The son has just 
announced his engagement to the older brother's fiancee; the brother was 
reported missing in action three years before," explains Julia, who is also 
company executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "It leads to (a disclosure of) the father's dark secrets, which have to do 
with the war. In the larger picture, if Joe Keller had not done what he did, 
his American dream would've crumbled. He's not a villain, he's a survivor -- an 
extreme example. The play deals with the complex justifications we all have for 
doing horrible acts." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining "All My Sons" in the company's spring repertory season will be 
Moliere's "The School for Wives," March 23 to May 14, and Shakespeare's "All's 
Well That Ends Well," April 6 to May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Elliotts -- who co-starred in last winter's staging of Garcia-Lorca's 
"Blood Wedding" -- met at the University of Florida in Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, Geoff ventured to San Francisco's prestigious American 
Conservatory Theatre; a few years later, Julia joined him at ACT, where they 
spent four years. In 1987, they moved to Los Angeles, and in 1988, their 
daughter Alison was born. "She's at the theater all the time," Geoff says. 
"It's great; several of the other actors have kids here too. I can't imagine 
living any other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Julia says the 2-year-old company, largely composed of ACT alumni, originated 
because "we were doing a lot of repertory, going out of town, and decided we 
wanted to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go through all that training and never get a chance to use it. We didn't 
anticipate this kind of growth, but the response has been so encouraging. Most 
of our audience is from Glendale, Burbank and Pasadena, but we're getting 
people from all over now. Some of them come and stay for the weekend -- and see 
all three plays." Where and When What: "All My Sons." Location: A Noise Within, 
234 S. Brand Blvd., Glendale. Hours: 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 7 p.m. Sunday; 
8 p.m. March 17 to 19; 7 p.m. March 20; 8 p.m. March 31, April 2, 13, 16; 2 
p.m. April 17; 8 p.m. April 22; 2 p.m. April 23; 8 p.m. April 28; 7 p.m. May 1. 
Closes May 1. Price: $10 previews, $15 regular admission, $20 opening and 
closing nights. Call: (818) 546-1924.

WHEN LASSIE COMES HOME; WHEN NEW MOVIE VERSION OF THE POOCH HITS THEATERS THIS 
SUMMER, DEMAND FOR COLLIE LOOK-ALIKES IS EXPECTED TO SOAR. 
</P>

 When the newest "Lassie" movie reaches theaters this summer, Paramount 
Pictures won't be the only one with a chance to profit from the courageous 
hound. Pet stores and dog breeders can expect a surge in customers who simply 
must have a collie of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a common phenomenon. Beer commercials featuring Spuds MacKenzie made the 
American bull terrier popular overnight, industry experts say. After the 1990 
film "Beethoven," St. Bernards became the rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have seen it in a commercial or a movie, everybody wants one," said 
Todd Wick, manager of Pups N' Pets in North Hollywood. "It's like a fad." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a story about the average family visiting their local animal 
shelter in search of a lovable pet. This is about people who desire an exact 
replica of what they've seen on screen. When the dog in question is a mixed 
breed -- a mutt like "Benji," for example -- finding a look-alike can be 
tricky. Not so with purebreds. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best example of the "hot dog" syndrome involves the 1985 
re-release of Disney's animated classic "101 Dalmatians." The black-and-white 
dog quickly shot into the Top 10 of the American Kennel Club's list of popular 
breeds, where it remains. 
</P>
<P>
 But a lot of people smitten with spots didn't realize that Dalmatians are 
highly energetic and prone to deafness, both of which can make them difficult 
to raise. At the same time, experts say, the demand for Dalmatians encouraged 
new breeders to leap into business, which increased risks of genetic defects 
the arise from over-breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar scenario could unfold when "Lassie" makes her big-screen comeback in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 So, potential owners blinded by a case of puppy love may find themselves 
yearning for a dog that might not be suited for them. And even the forewarned 
shopper risks purchasing a poorly bred animal. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to be careful," said Jim Whitman, an executive vice president at 
Petland Inc., which operates a Northridge shop as well as 136 others 
nationwide. "It's buyer beware when a breed gets very popular." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Stardom and dogs share a long history. Rin Tin Tin was the first canine movie 
idol. A Lana Turner-figure in doggy film lore, he was discovered in a deserted 
German army outpost after World War I and went on to star in dozens of films. 
The Alsatian produced such big box office numbers that he was dubbed "the 
mortgage-lifter" for saving his studio from financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since, movies such as "The Shaggy Dog," "Old Yeller" and "Benji" 
have garnered similar success, lending credence to the acting axiom: Never 
share the spotlight with a child or an animal because you're likely to be 
upstaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Other types of animals have grabbed the limelight, including Cheetah the 
chimp, Francis the Talking Mule and Flipper the dolphin. But, according to the 
Film Encyclopedia, Hollywood favors dogs because they are easy to train. And, 
this being the Chinese Year of the Dog, the movie industry will return this 
summer to a proven formula: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Goofy Movie" brings Disney's rubbery hound to a full-length feature. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Yellow Dog" stars Bruce Davison and Mimi Rogers in the adventure of a 
teen-age boy who lands in the rugged wilderness of the Pacific Northwest and 
befriends a trusted dog. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Myth of the White Wolf" continues the adventures of the half-dog, 
half-wolf named White Fang. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is not beyond the realm of possibility, industry experts say, that pet 
stores will soon receive inquiries about wolf pups. When it comes to dogs and 
movies, they say, practical considerations fly out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 The results can be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually it goes something like this: You get an animal you thought you wanted 
and you get it home and it bites your kid or kills your cat. Maybe it barks all 
night. Or it jumps the fence," said Lt. Richard Felosky of the Los Angeles 
Animal Regulation Department. "The breed has a lot to do with it. You need to 
know what to expect from a certain breed of dog and ask yourself if you're 
willing to spend time training the dog away from bad habits." 
</P>
<P>
 Behavior is merely one consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Collies, for example, require twice-a-week brushings because of their long 
hair. "Not a lazy man's dog," Wick explained. And although some pet store 
workers insist that dogs can adapt to any environment, those adorable Labrador 
retriever puppies inevitably grow too large for an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some times when you look at the couple and the dog and think, 'This 
is a match made in heaven,' " said Marlyn Diamond-Gray, manager of Peggy Wood's 
Pet Emporium in Burbank. "Other times you think, 'Maybe not.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Caution was especially warranted during the Shar-Pei craze a few years back. 
Whitman says a fad arose when Neiman Marcus featured the wrinkly Chinese breed 
on the cover of its Christmas catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had people come in and say, 'I've got to have one, I've got to have one,' 
" he recalled. "We told them, point-blank, that the breed has significant skin 
problems that have to be managed. There are special needs with their eyes 
because of all the skin folds." 
</P>
<P>
 Petland stores made customers sign a letter of acknowledgment before selling 
them a Shar-Pei. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent as much time talking people out of the dog as we did selling them 
the dog," Whitman said. "We sent them home with a rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 Some pet stores undoubtedly prefer to make a sale. With the release of its 
annual rankings, the AKC warns that pet shoppers should take care to "choose a 
breed of dog that is appropriate for their needs and not because they think it 
is fashionable." Similarly, Felosky insists that consumers bear the ultimate 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>

</P>

 "It's like shopping for shoes," the shelter official said. "When you buy a 
pair of shoes, you look at color and size, is it made of a comfortable 
material?" 
</P>
<P>
 The variables increase with living, breathing creatures. Felosky suggests 
spending an hour in a public library before beginning the search for a pet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some excellent books that will tell you what you need to know about 
each breed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential owners should ask themselves a number of questions. Do they have 
enough space for the size of dog they want? If they have children, is the breed 
gentle with kids? Do they want the pet to be a watchdog? If so, do they want a 
large dog that will scare intruders or merely a barker to sound the alarm? 
</P>
<P>
 Few of these issues are addressed on the silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the dog's breeding, laymen can know only so much. Industry experts 
suggest that veteran breeders are more reliable. And a breeder who keeps the 
dogs in a clean and spacious environment is less likely to over-breed. 
</P>
<P>
 When buying from a pet store, consumers risk getting a dog from what the 
industry calls "puppy mills" or "back-yard breeders" who recklessly breed 
father to daughter or mother to son to produce as many puppies as possible. 
This can result in dogs that suffer health problems or are nervous and 
hyperactive. Consumers should ask their pet shop plenty of questions about the 
breeder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do our best," Diamond-Gray said. "Our general manager and the vice 
president of our corporation tour all the kennels. They've met the people, had 
dinner in their homes. They've seen how the animals are kept." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, experts say, dog owners who do a little research first are the ones 
who tend to be happiest with the animal they choose. That's vital because many 
breeds live from 15 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For some people, a collie might fill those years with companionship. Others 
might find themselves happier with another breed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, don't pick a dog because it is what's cool and what's 
pretty and what's prestigious," Whitman said. "It's like meeting someone in Las 
Vegas and getting married. You wake up the next morning and say, 'Uh-oh.' " Top 
Dogs 
</P>
<P>
 The American Kennel Club last week announced its most popular breeds of 1993. 
These are the purebred dogs that, among the 136 recognized by the AKC, 
accounted for the most new registrations last year: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Labrador retriever 2. Rottweiler 3. German shepherd 4. Cocker spaniel 5. 
Golden retriever 6. Poodle 7. Beagle 8. Dachshund 9. Dalmatian 10. Shetland 
sheep dog When Picking a Pooch . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Five questions to ask: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Do we have enough time to exercise and care for this dog? 2. Do we have 
enough room? 3. Can we afford to feed this animal? 4. Will it get along with 
our kids? 5. Should we get a male (generally aggressive) or female (gentler)?

TIES THAT BIND; MARGI SCHARFF'S INSTALLATION LINKING MUNDANE ITEMS SHOWS HOW WE 
CONNECT 'TO HISTORY AND TO PEOPLE THROUGHOUT TIME.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Margi Scharff received an invitation to a 72-year-old man's birthday 
party, she began thinking about what to give him. 
</P>
<P>
 She pondered how there must have been many people along the way who had 
affected his life, about how one thing leads to another. She decided that she 
would collect 72 things and connect them one to another. Around her studio she 
found nails, rubber bands, string and rope before she branched out to seek 
other kinds of connectors. The gift ended up 12 feet long, a seemingly endless 
chain that kept the birthday boy enthralled as he pulled and pulled to get it 
out of the box. 
</P>
<P>
 Scharff couldn't forget the idea of connection that she developed putting 
together that gift. In 1992, she created the installation, "A Series of 
Miscellaneous Connections . . ." at Cerritos College's Art Gallery. Since then, 
she has expanded upon that artwork. Its current evolution, at Woodbury 
University's Art Gallery in Burbank, takes viewers on an inventive, joyful 
ride, using the most mundane of objects to send them to the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a portrait of people and how we connect ourselves to history and to 
people throughout time," said Scharff, who collected connecting objects from 
friends as she put the work together. 
</P>
<P>
 She began with a piece of string and thoughts about the less than innocuous 
nature of connectors. Nails pierce an object. Rubber bands hold and expand. 
</P>
<P>
 The linear portion of the installation, which winds its way across one wall of 
the gallery, is made up of everything from car parts, rings, earrings, a tape 
dispenser, clothes and safety pins to nails, neckties, barrettes and keys, lots 
of keys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the kind of person who loses keys all the time," Scharff said. "Keys are 
a particular function of our society. They are about connections and barriers." 
</P>
<P>
 Certain objects would "spring out of line," said Scharff, accumulating into 
groups by color, texture or function. "It's the linear aspect rolling itself 
into balls." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon reaching the end of the chain of connections on the wall, one turns to 
face an explosion of variously sized balls, scattered from floor almost to the 
ceiling, conveying the sense of heavenly bodies in space. Each ball sports 
primarily one type of connector -- electrical wires and cords, rubber bands, 
ties, belts, shoelaces -- to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has been fascinated by the inner workings of things, from the 
rubber-band layers of golf balls to the mazes of electrical appliances, will 
likely be drawn to the tactile nature of these pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 At the opposite end of the gallery is a group of small prints and photographs. 
The mixed-media lithographs, "In the beginning," embody stellar space. 
Scharff's self-portraits are the central focus of the multilayered photographs. 
 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Using my face, I can work figuratively. The prints are celestial scale; 
anything I make sculpturally is going to be human scale," Scharff said. "I 
don't limit myself to a certain set of materials. I feel free not to limit 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 "What I liked about the installation is its narrative quality, its visualizing 
of random thoughts," said gallery director Carolee Toon-Parker. "Like speech 
and language, it goes through transmutations." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real playful piece," Scharff said. "In the beginning I envisioned a 
braid that got thicker. I started out with a set idea and it changed. The 
objects affected one another, and I didn't anticipate that. There were visual 
connections in the shapes of things. And I was surprised by what friends gave 
me, by people's different interpretations of connection." 
</P>
<P>
 Among unanticipated items were a 45 r.p.m. record -- "sound connects you to a 
time," she said -- and baby bottle nipples from a new mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "The playfulness of this (installation) is really important to me," Scharff 
said. "I would like to see people laughing in here. There is humor in odd 
connections. And I do like the belief that you can make art out of anything."

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: A WAREHOUSE FULL OF THRIFT TREASURES; JUST ABOUT EVERY 
CATEGORY IS REPRESENTED AT THE ST. VINCENT DE PAUL STORE. AND REGAL RENTS PLANS 
ITS ANNUAL SALE OF PARTY GOODS.

 OK, I admit it, I'm a junk junkie and so are many of my friends. Our idea of a 
great day is to munch and "junk." And if we uncover a treasure costing 
practically nothing, the day is a huge success. But even if we come home 
empty-handed, it's still been fun if the pickings are good. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing quite like the St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store in Lincoln 
Heights for hunting down treasures at extremely low prices. This warehouse 
store has been here since 1968 and is so vast that it's hard to see all the 
merchandise in just one visit. 
</P>
<P>
 We started with the furniture -- sofas for $30, chairs for $12, tables of all 
sizes for $8 to $80. One wall is devoted to lamps, and some pretty fair ones at 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 The bicycle department is awesome, whether you're looking for one to ride or 
one for exercising. There were 20 to 30 bicycles, priced from $7 to about $25. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about every category is represented at this shop -- office equipment, 
furniture, housewares, toys, shoes and clothes for men, women and children. 
With 2,500 pieces of clothing coming on the floor each day, all neatly sorted 
by paid employees, the depth of the clothing inventory is vast, says Dorothy 
Llamas, the store director. 
</P>
<P>
 My shopping buddy found a wonderful, like-new black cashmere coat with the 
Pearsall's label for $22, and I uncovered a perfect Gucci scarf for 99 cents. 
We both left shopped-out, but happy as clams. We stopped in Chinatown for a 
meal on our way home and -- voila! -- a perfect day. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Vincent de Paul maintains a shelter on Skid Row, a rehabilitation center, 
a camp for underprivileged boys and girls, and is one of the charities helping 
disaster victims.

people line up early for great buys in used (and some new) table linens, 
flatware, dishes, stemware, folding chairs and tables at prices about 50% to 
80% off retail. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's blowout will offer an item the company has never sold before and 
doesn't plan to again -- children's yellow plastic stack chairs for $3.95. 
Preschools should love that. 
</P>
<P>

RELUCTANT NOVICE: WINNING AT LOSING; VISITING A DIETITIAN RESULTS IN A CUSTOM 
DIET -- COOKIES INCLUDED -- AND INSPIRING WORDS.

 Like many overweight Americans, I'm trying to wake up and smell the tofu, even 
if I'd rather have an Egg McMuffin. The extra pounds I've gained over 10 years 
of marriage are an unwelcome albatross around my neck, even if most of them 
have, ahem, settled elsewhere on my endomorphic frame. I have a file full of 
diet recipes and a pantry full of artificial sweetener. But my submission to 
Mrs. Fields, among other temptations, always seems to get in the way of 
permanent progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Having tried the liquid diet route without lasting success (like Oprah), I 
decide to try nutrition counseling. A good friend of mine lost 77 pounds and 
has kept it off for five years through exercise and counseling. She tells me 
the best way to get my money's worth is to seek out a registered dietitian. 
Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist, but a registered dietitian has a 
bachelor's degree. They are also required to intern for six months to a year at 
a teaching hospital. Look for the R.D. accreditation after their name. 
</P>
<P>
 I make an appointment with Joan Levinthal, a registered dietitian in Woodland 
Hills with 15 years experience. Until our appointment, she asks me to keep a 
list of the foods I eat for two weekdays and one weekend day, and note if my 
eating habits vary on Saturday or Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 She also asks me to write down foods I like to eat and list any medications 
taken regularly, including vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
 This sounds easy enough. However, on the day I begin the list I find myself 
trying to eat only sensible foods to impress her. Even this pressure doesn't 
completely curb temptation, though. I still want my cookies and, agonizing with 
pen to paper, record each and every one.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after two days of recording my meals, I head to Woodland Hills for my 
consultation. I down a submarine sandwich and a Diet Coke as I drive. I park my 
car as I dust the bread crumbs off of my blouse. Popping in a mint to offset 
possible onion breath, I catch sight of the dietitian's personalized license 
plate: Diets 4 U. I prepare to say hello tofu and goodby pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 Levinthal ushers me into her office, and I am seated near her desk equipped 
with a computer terminal. Behind me is a table of healthy packaged foods such 
as butter substitutes and sweeteners. We chitchat a moment, and she works up to 
the dreaded question: How much do I weigh? My mind races. Do I give her my 
driver's license weight or the real thing?  
</P>
<P>
 I come clean with the truth. She then says, "Would you mind stepping on the 
scale?" Oh no! How can I tell her to subtract at least two pounds for my lunch? 
Onto her hospital-style scale I hop. YIKES! I am seven pounds heavier than I 
thought. I express some surprise, and think of blaming at least some of it on 
my lunch, but decide to let sleeping subs lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Levinthal explains that the only way to achieve weight loss success is to 
write down personal reasons for wanting to lose and posting them in critical 
places -- on the refrigerator, in a car, at a desk. Friends and family should 
be supportive as well, she says, by laying off the greasy potato chips and 
slippery barbecued ribs. I nod, wondering how to explain this to my Fred 
Flintstone of a husband who knows our butcher by his first name and owns a 
monogrammed meat brand.  
</P>
<P>
 I admit to her that vanity is my primary motivation: I want to look better in 
my clothes. Levinthal seems pleased with my reasons and comments that they are 
positive goals, unlike losing weight for a concerned doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 She then asks to see the list of foods I like. When she sees kung pao chicken 
on it, she says she believes that the popular Chinese dish has as much fat in 
it as four Quarter Pounders from McDonalds. Ouch! Much to my surprise, however, 
she does not lecture me about my cookie addiction. She then calls up a program 
on her computer and punches out a personalized three-day diet for me that 
includes several of my favorite foods -- popcorn, meatless burgers and even 
cookies! I am amazed not only at the foods in the diet but the amount of food I 
can eat -- four times a day -- and still keep my intake at 1,350 calories.  
</P>
<P>
 But the amount of some of the foods is significantly less than I normally eat. 
And the cookies I am allowed are not those I would normally buy. While the diet 
won't be painless, it doesn't sound unreasonable, either. I tell her I think I 
can do it, and she looks at me with confidence and says, "Of course you can." 
Hearing that helps me to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 We wrap up the hour with a quick discussion about some of the fat and sugar 
substitutes available, many of which she has free samples to distribute to 
clients. I take home a plastic bag full of goodies including butter substitutes 
and a folder with my diet in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Levinthal's introductory one-hour consultation with diet program is $60. She 
recommends weekly visits for support in the first month, tapering off to 
bimonthly visits until an individual's goal is reached. Follow-up visits cost 
$30 each.  
</P>
<P>
 Like any dieter, I realize my battle is an uphill one. And while Molly 
McButter isn't exactly fabulous, I bet it tastes delicious if you eat it 
wearing a bikini.

WHEN THE YOUNG GRIEVE; A SUPPORT GROUP OFFERED AT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY CENTERS 
HELPS BRING TEEN-AGERS WHO HAVE ENCOUNTERED TRAGEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HAMMERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Maryann Hammers writes regularly for 
The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gema Mitchell, 16, of Van Nuys experienced more tragic losses last fall than 
many people face in a lifetime. In September her close friend was mur dered 
after a Bible study class. Her aunt's fiance was killed by a drunken driver in 
November. A few weeks later her teen-age cousin was shot to death.  
</P>
<P>
 With no outlet to release her grief and anger, Gema shut down. "I didn't care 
about any of my classes," she said. "My grade-point average fell from 3.5 to 1. 
I am a social person, but I stopped going out. I could barely think. I just 
dropped." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned, Gema's mother searched for a program that would help her daughter. 
She learned about a support group at Kaiser Permanente medical center in 
Panorama City called Teen Age Grief -- better known as TAG -- offered at high 
schools and community centers throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 TAG was created in 1984 by grief counselor Linda Cunningham, director of 
bereavement services at Kaiser. She came up with the idea when two close 
friends, a married couple with three teen-age children, died of cancer within a 
few years of each other. Although support groups for widows, bereaved parents 
and other adults abounded, no groups for young people existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teens need to talk to other teen-agers who understand their issues," 
Cunningham said. "They are scared. They are angry. Adults have no idea what 
these kids carry around with them when they are grieving, and we expect them to 
concentrate on their science and math." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who reads the headlines realizes that today's teens are more likely 
than previous generations to know someone who died violently. According to FBI 
reports, children under 18 are 244% more likely to be killed by guns than they 
were in 1986. In 1992, more than one in five California homicide victims were 
19 or younger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many more teens have lost peers to violence than when TAG started," 
Cunningham said. "Many of these kids have lost more than one friend by their 
senior year. Some have lost four or five friends. A lot have witnessed the 
death -- they have seen the drive-by or the murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not all TAG members lost a loved one to violence. They may be 
mourning a parent who succumbed to cancer or a heart attack; a fellow student 
may have been stricken by AIDS or hit by a car, or a friend may have committed 
suicide. But regardless of the cause of death, fellow TAG members understand 
each other in a way that no one else can, Gema said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how someone dies, they are gone," she said. "You feel like someone 
stole something from you. So everyone in the group has the same feeling of 
being violated. Other people forget anything happened to you and ask stupid 
questions like 'Why are you still crying?' or else they make stupid assumptions 
and they say, 'Why aren't you crying?' " 
</P>
<P>
 TAG members meet for six to eight weeks, and they may repeat the program as 
often as necessary. Teens are encouraged to bring photos, mementos or music 
that remind them of the deceased, and they stage a memorial service, complete 
with poems, flowers and posters in honor of their loved ones. The gatherings 
are anything but morbid, according to Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't sit and cry for an hour and a half," she said. "We don't talk about 
death, but the value of the life of this person. We give them ideas for 
expressing anger without hurting themselves, such as screaming into a pillow or 
writing a letter to the deceased. And we spend a lot of time identifying each 
other's strengths." 
</P>
<P>
 Modesty Cass, 16, who attends TAG meetings at Taft High School in Woodland 
Hills, said the group helped her resolve her anger over her father's death last 
year. A "tissue toss" session, in which she ripped every sheet out of a fresh 
box of tissues, was particularly beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat in the middle of the room, and as I threw the tissues, I was throwing 
away my anger," she said. "Then other members of the group would pick up a 
tissue and give it back to me along with something positive -- a kind word or 
helpful hint." 
</P>
<P>
 In the three weeks since Gema joined TAG, she already has noticed her attitude 
improving. "I am concentrating on my homework, and I am getting it together," 
she said. Where and When LIAISON: GET MAC TOPPER: WHERE AND WHEN What: Teen Age 
Grief support groups. Location: Offered at many high schools in San Fernando 
and Santa Clarita valleys. Also at Kaiser Permanente, Panorama City. Call: TAG 
headquarters, (805) 253-1932, Kaiser's bereavement services office, (818) 
375-3528, or contact a high school counselor.

BABY'S FIRST SCREEN TEST; EXPECTANT PARENTS ARE TURNING TO ULTRASOUND, OFTEN 
JUST TO GET A PEEK AT THEIR UNBORN CHILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Mary Rauch and Ellie Rice started their new business, they sent out birth 
announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs may be the ultimate amniotic enter tainment, a chance for parents-to-be 
to share fuzzy prenatal pictures of their beloved fetus with family and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they opened the doors of their Westlake Village office in October, the 
women have welcomed a steady stream of pregnant Southlanders who don't hesitate 
for a moment to expose their swollen bellies so that spouses, parents, 
siblings, earlier offspring and just plain pals can oooh and aaah over Junior's 
antics in utero. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure is a simple, painless one. The expectant mother settles into a 
reclining chair next to an ultrasound machine, while her guests get comfortable 
on a nearby sofa. A trained sonographer smears Mom's abdomen with goo, then 
runs a probe that looks like a hand mike over the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The probe transmits sound waves into the woman's uterus and receives the sound 
waves that bounce back. Just as a submarine's sonar sees another submarine by 
interpreting rebounding sound waves, the fetal sonograph pictures the unborn 
child as he or she squirms and shifts in the confines of the mother's womb. 
What the sonographer sees on her monitor is simultaneously shown to mother and 
guests on a 20-inch TV screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Obstetricians have been using medical ultrasound since the 1970s to take a 
safe, non-invasive peek at the unborn child. Read skillfully, a sonogram (as an 
ultrasound picture is called) can often, but not always, reveal any gross 
abnormalities as well as the sex of the developing fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauch and Rice stress that their service is for entertainment purposes only. 
"We're not replacing anything the doctor does," Rice tells each new client. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that the service doesn't venture into doctors-only territory, the 
ultrasound equipment has been stripped of the peripherals that would allow them 
to measure the fetus or monitor its heartbeat -- standard on diagnostic 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ultrasound is not a risky procedure in the view of most physicians, even 
ultrasound that has no purpose beyond giving pleasure to the expectant and her 
loved ones. "As long as the mother is getting prenatal obstetrical care, the 
Precious Moments ultrasound should cause no harm to the fetus," said Dr. Fred 
Schaffner, an obstetrician in private practice in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauch had the idea for the service when she was carrying her first-born, 
Aleczandria Grazia, now 3 months old. "I wanted to see and get to know my 
baby," she recalled. But, like many physicians, Rauch's obstetrician saw no 
medical reason to recommend an ultrasound for his healthy, young patient. She 
ended up going to Nevada, where a non-physician technician friend gave her the 
prenatal picture she craved. 
</P>
<P>
 The women insist that all clients be under the care of a physician and prefer 
that they have already had a medical ultrasound. In part, Rice explains, this 
is to ensure that the Precious Moments' sonogram doesn't reveal some 
unanticipated fetal anomaly to an unprepared mother, a potential tragedy that 
they have never encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 Decorated like a cross between a nursery and a media center, the Westlake 
Village office includes such amenities as Barney activity books for 
preschoolers less than rapt at the prospect of viewing their new brother or 
sister. Aleczandria naps near her mother, who can pick the baby up and nurse 
her when she fusses. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, Patti Mosqueda, 26, is in the office to give her in-laws 
their first blurry glimpse of their unborn grandchild. Patti, who is almost 
eight months pregnant, has already had three medical ultrasounds with husband 
Raul, 22, at her side. But this is the first grandchild for Raul's parents, 
Kathy and Andy, and they are impatient to see the next generation of Mosquedas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Mosqueda also hopes that the procedure will reveal whether the baby is a 
boy or a girl. She is of Mexican heritage, she explains, and the old wive's 
tale is that if you are wide, you're going to have a girl. "It's a girl," she 
tells the Mosqueda men, both of whom are rooting for a boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't wait to get here," says Mosqueda, who has been drinking water all 
morning, trying to swell her bladder, which gives the sound waves something to 
bounce off and makes for a better picture. "I got up a 4 o'clock in the 
morning. I couldn't sleep because the baby was kicking so much." 
</P>
<P>
 The young Mosquedas live with Raul's parents in Oxnard, and they banter 
comfortably about such family matters as the odds -- high, it's agreed -- that 
the baby will have big ears and what to name the child. Raul Jr. is universally 
popular. If it's a girl, Patti likes Sara (it means princess) Nicole or Ashley 
Nicole. Most of all, she likes Presley Aaron, which her husband thinks is a 
silly name even for the daughter of a die-hard Elvis fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauch and Rice tell the Mosquedas what to look for if the ultrasound manages 
to home in on their pre-born's developing genitalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "A boy will look like a turtle, and a girl will look like a hamburger bun," 
Rice explains. She reminds the family that even if they glimpse the turtle-head 
structure that indicates the presence of a penis, they shouldn't invest too 
heavily in boy stuff. Ultrasound is only 95% accurate, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights go out, and the show begins. "That's your little person in there," 
sonographer Sherri Cvijanovich says as an undulating shape she identifies as 
the baby's face appears on the TV screen. "Is the mouth open?" the beaming 
grandmother wonders. It is indeed, she learns. There are sighs of wonder as the 
tiny creature raises a recognizable fist and executes an intrauterine 
somersault. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow!" the family cries when they spot the beating heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti is as moved by the shadowy images as if she already had this little 
creature in her arms. "That baby looks like he's smiling," she says proudly. 
"Say hi to Mama." 
</P>
<P>
 The baby is packed low in Patti's uterus, and the sonographer is having 
trouble zooming in on the groin. "I can't buy you anything if you won't show me 
what you are," Patti chides gently. "Be nice," the sonographer urges the fetus. 
"Show me. We don't want shoulder right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoulder, however, is what they get. The ultrasound, which is being videotaped 
for the Mosquedas to take home, is over in 20 minutes, and the sex of baby 
Mosqueda has yet to be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mosquedas, who have just watched a miracle, could care less. Where and 
When What: Precious Moments. Location: 973 Westlake Blvd., Suite 208, Westlake 
Village. Price: The service, which includes a videotape and still photos taken 
during the ultrasound, costs $60, plus tax. Call: (805) 494-1306.

PASTA WITH PIZAZZ; ENCINO'S TRILUSSA, WITH ITS ELEGANT BUT FESTIVE AMBIENCE, IS 
DRAWING CROWDS: 900 FOLKS IN A DAY CAN'T BE WRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you extrude it, they will come. Remember those fateful words. They're a 
restaurant owner's mantra on this side of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley's pasta mania probably accounts for the veritable 
tidal wave of diners flocking to Trilussa, a swank new trattoria. It's drawing 
crowds of up to 900 on busy days, an amazing figure when you consider the 
dozens of Italian restaurants that compete with it up and down the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can't ignore the fact that, food aside, this is simply a gorgeous 
place to eat. Actually, all the Trilussa restaurants (Beverly Hills, Santa 
Monica, Glendale and Rome, Italy) are easy on the eyes: big, airy places with 
an earthy and festive appeal. This spacious place may be the most attractive 
restaurant in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceiling is blond wood punctuated by two skylights. The open kitchen is a 
mass of gleaming white tile. On a gorgeous spring day, it's a real pleasure 
just to sit at a table by the open side doors, getting a hit of sky from within 
and without (the restaurant is adjacent to a small park). In the evenings, of 
course, the thrill isn't the light. It's the madhouse buzz of a ferociously 
popular restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the swank in this dining area comes from the square-jawed terra cotta 
floor and tables smartly set with elegant two-toned tablecloths. Waitresses 
sport little black and yellow bow ties that look like Monarch butterflies; 
fitting attire, as they flit around almost nonstop in the overflow crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 I can do without the restaurant's corny Italian paintings and wall-mounted 
groceries, but the tomato cans and hanging salumeria inside the kitchen strike 
up the appetite on cue. And that's good, because you need an appetite to do 
this menu justice. 
</P>
<P>
 To start with, everyone gets a basket of the chewy, flattish Italian country 
bread known as ciabatta . For reasons I've been unable to deduce, selected 
lucky tables also get wonderful pizza dough focaccia , hot out of the oven, 
lightly brushed with olive oil. (I finally got some on my third visit.) This 
bread foreshadows the restaurant's fine pizzas and its creative bruschette , 
which are not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always thought of bruschette as grilled country bread rubbed with olive 
oil and garlic, with the possible addition of chopped tomatoes and basil, even 
a little cheese. Trilussa serves all those variants and also throws tuna and 
arugula into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about two dozen pizzas, and for me, they're as good as any served in 
the Valley. I have a bone to pick with one of them, though, the delicious 
prosciutto e funghi pizza. It's a crisp matzo-like crust topped with gooey 
whole-milk mozzarella and a tomato and mushroom sauce with a judicious pinch of 
sugar in it. Here's my gripe: They slice the pizza into quarters, but then 
drape two big strips of sliced prosciutto across the top, making it awkward to 
divide. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a bit before choosing from the mouth-watering list of antipasti, because 
the waitress is going to give you a complimentary starter no matter what you 
order. One night the free dish turned out to be a fine antipasto spread in 
itself -- salami, terrific marinated eggplant and zucchini, bufala mozzarella 
and a variety of Italian pickles. Another night, we got a plate of mushy 
polenta, topped with a grainy marinara sauce and a half rack of veal ribs. 
That's what I call generous. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the big draw here, those complex carbos. At Trilussa, pasta 
essentially comes in three forms: angel hair, spaghetti and penne . All three 
are served classically al dente . Now choose your sauce. Penne al salmone , for 
instance, comes with wonderfully smoky bits of chopped salmon.  
</P>
<P>
 If you count tortelloni as pasta (and I do), consider these fine little fat 
green doughnut shapes that the chefs stuff with things like ricotta and 
spinach. But as for that other quasi-pasta, gnocchi, I must report that one 
friend compared them to chewing gum. In truth, Trilussa's gnocchi are passable, 
but they'd never pass the grandmother test. 
</P>
<P>
 Trilussa's prices would, though. There isn't a single pasta costing more than 
$8.95, and it's no problem to eat here for less than $20 a person. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that mantra needs alterations. If you extrude it, dress it up, don't 
overcook it and make the price competitive, then -- Giovanna, bar the door! 
They will come in droves. Where and When What: Trilussa. Location: 16925 
Ventura Blvd., Encino. Suggested Dishes: bruschette tonno e rugola , $3.95; 
pizzas, $5.95 to $8.95; penne arrabbiata , $6.75; penne salmone , $8.25; 
tortelloni di ricotta e spinaci , $8.25. Hours: Lunch and dinner 11 a.m. to 
11:30 p.m. daily. Price: Dinner for two, $28 to $42. Full bar. Valet parking. 
All major credit cards. Call: (818) 905-6595.

DOUBLING OF BOND ISSUE PROPOSED TO COVER QUAKE COSTS; RECOVERY: COMPROMISE 
PACKAGE TOTALS $2 BILLION FOR RELIEF AND RETROFITTING, BUT $650 MILLION WOULD 
GO FOR BAY AREA BRIDGE REPAIR. LEGISLATURE IS EXPECTED TO VOTE MONDAY.

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and legislative leaders agreed Thursday on an expanded 
$2-billion bond issue to pay for Northridge earthquake recovery and for seismic 
safety improvements on highway bridges, with the work weighted heavily toward 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, scheduled for a vote by both houses of the Legislature on 
Monday, also includes a separate $1-billion public school construction bond 
issue, which will nearly triple the amount of bonds initially proposed by 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first indication of a regional split over earthquake recovery funding, 
nearly two-thirds of the highway money is earmarked for work on toll bridges in 
the San Francisco Bay Area. Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said Southern 
California would be shortchanged by the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican governor and leaders of both houses reached the settlement as 
pressure mounted to fashion an earthquake recovery bond program that could be 
submitted to voters on the June 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who favors a temporary 
sales tax increase to finance earthquake recovery, warned that the Assembly may 
not approve the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope it passes. I don't know," he said. "It's going to be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, whose district was hit hard by the Northridge earthquake, protested that 
about $650 million of a $1-billion bond issue for shoring up threatened highway 
bridges statewide would pay for work on Bay Area toll bridges. Brown and Senate 
leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) were the two Democratic negotiators of the 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the governor's proposal, there is a lot of money to take care of the 
Bay Area but not nearly enough for what needs to be done in Southern 
California," Katz said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Swept off the bargaining table during the negotiations was Brown's 
quarter-cent sales tax increase that would be in effect for two years. 
Democrats had proposed that the tax be activated automatically as a backup if 
the bond issue is defeated June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 If voters reject the $2-billion bond issue, Wilson and the Legislature will 
have to start from scratch in paying for earthquake relief, and will be pressed 
to make additional heavy cuts in the state budget or raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, the agreement represented a victory in his steadfast opposition to 
a tax increase as he runs for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson originally had proposed a $1.05-billion bond issue to finance the 
repair of dwellings of low-income victims of the Northridge quake and to 
provide the state's share of funds to accompany $9.5 billion in relief already 
approved by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 His plan received a hostile response from many Democrats, who favored a 
temporary tax increase, and only lukewarm support from Wilson's fellow 
Republicans, some of whom have argued that the money should come from budget 
cuts. Democrats argued that paying off the bonds would be more costly to 
taxpayers than a temporary sales tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 If voters approve the bonds, the debt will be paid off with general tax 
revenues over 20 or 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to make it more attractive to legislators and voters who live 
outside the quake-damaged Los Angeles area, Wilson and key legislators decided 
to double the bond proposal to $2 billion by adding the statewide seismic 
safety retrofit feature. 
</P>
<P>
 The added $1 billion would be spent on strengthening hundreds of highway 
bridges throughout California considered "at risk" during an earthquake. But 
most of the money would pay for seismic strengthening of toll bridges in the 
Bay Area.  
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the state Department of Transportation to more aggressively 
strengthen potentially hazardous bridges throughout California has threatened 
to become an issue in Wilson's reelection campaign. On Thursday, his 
administrators embarked on an accelerated program to retrofit the 1,000 
highest-priority structures in the next year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have warned that if the retrofitting is paid out of existing highway 
funds, the work would occur at the expense of previously authorized 
transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz suggested that the compromise reflected a regional point of view by 
Lockyer, who succeeded Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) as leader of the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a regional standpoint, it shows how Roberti's resignation can hurt 
Southern California because we don't have someone in there who is as strong an 
advocate for Southern California as Roberti was," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer could not be reached for comment, but earlier he praised the 
agreement. "This is not just a retrospective cleanup, but a prospective safety 
improvement of our highways and bridges," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate GOP leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, who advanced the idea of including 
retrofitting, said his proposal made the whole package a "better sell" to 
lawmakers and voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation requires two-thirds approval by each house and majority 
approval by voters statewide. Speaker Brown said at least seven Assembly 
Democrats announced that they would not vote for it. On the Republican side, 
Assembly Minority leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said only about half of 
the 32 Republicans would support it. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddy said Wilson and the lawmakers were warned by the secretary of state's 
office that any bond issue aimed at June 7 would have to be enacted very 
quickly in order for ballots and voters pamphlets to be printed in time. A 
deadline of Feb. 22 set by the secretary of state was ignored by Wilson and the 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wilson and the legislative leaders prevail, voters will face $5 billion 
worth of bonds on the June 7 ballot. These include the $2-billion proposal for 
earthquake recovery and seismic retrofitting, $1 billion for public schools and 
a $2-billion bond issue initiative for parks and recreation that qualified 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed $1 billion for public schools was favored by Democrats and would 
earmark $400 million for new construction, up to $400 million for 
modernization, including campus security measures, and up to $200 million for 
earthquake safety retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the school bonds were included in the agreement because more 
classrooms are a high priority for Democratic legislators because of burgeoning 
school populations in urban districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The school bond proposal would be on the ballot separately and was given the 
catchy title "Safe Schools Act of 1994." But state Sen. Leroy Greene 
(D-Carmichael), author of the new bill fashioned by Wilson and the legislative 
leaders, said he doubted that any of the bond funds would be spent for seismic 
improvements. He noted that schools long have been built to earthquake safety 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene said most of $200 million for proposed seismic safety eventually would 
be spent on new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 50 years, California has financed highway and transportation 
projects on a pay-as-you-go basis that depends on highway user levies, 
including the gasoline tax, truck weight fees and various motor vehicle fees. 
Previously, highway construction was financed by bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Gov. George Deukmejian sought to bail out the state's under-financed 
transportation program with a $1-billion bond issue. It lost at the polls by a 
narrow 500 votes statewide. NORTHERN CALIFOR

SANTA MONICA FREEWAY COULD REOPEN IN MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL and NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heralding good news for thousands of commuters, state transportation officials 
announced Thursday that repair work on collapsed sections of the Santa Monica 
Freeway is moving ahead so quickly that the roadway will be opened to traffic 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
 By working around the clock, seven days a week, the contractors who are 
repairing the world's busiest expressway have pushed work more than a month 
ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway, which normally carries 341,000 cars a day, was closed at two 
points after sections of the elevated roadway collapsed at La Cienega and 
Washington boulevards during the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials set a June 24 deadline for completion of the repairs, but 
offered the contractors incentives for finishing early. They will get a bonus 
of $200,000 a day if they beat the deadline, but will be penalized by the same 
amount for each day beyond the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 If the work is done 30 days ahead of time, the contractors will receive an 
extra $6 million on the $15-million contract. But state and company officials 
say that some of the bonus will be eaten up by the expense of paying crews to 
work extra hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Roberts, chief engineer at Caltrans, said records show that C.C. Myers 
Co., the firm rebuilding the Santa Monica Freeway, has completed 30% of the 
work, while only 20% of the time on the contract has elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's way ahead," Roberts said. "We expect to see that freeway open in May." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 quake damaged freeways in 200 locations. Seventy-eight bridges 
suffered moderate to major damage. Six bridges collapsed, causing closures and 
major detours. 
</P>
<P>
 For commuters, the crippled Santa Monica Freeway has forced traffic onto 
crowded surface streets between Santa Monica and Downtown Los Angeles. 
Typically, the detours have resulted in delays of 20 minutes or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs on four other freeway failures in the north end of the San Fernando 
Valley are also well ahead of schedule, Roberts said. The total repair bill 
will be about $100 million, he said. Incentives to finish early range from a 
high of $200,000 a day to $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Bauer, vice president of C.C. Myers, estimated that the company will 
complete its work about 40 days ahead of schedule, or by mid-May. Clinton C. 
Myers, company president, said he expects to finish the job even earlier, by 
the beginning of May. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ahead of our projected schedule and we hope to continue to accelerate 
and pick up more time," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said that the speedy work does not mean a reduction in quality and that 
the company will cut no corners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job is being built to the highest standards," he said. "There is nothing 
that's temporary or any design criteria . . . being disregarded." 
</P>
<P>
 Although 200 workers are now on the job and two of the crews are already 
working 12-hour shifts, Bauer said he hoped to increase the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said they selected C.C. Myers because the firm was the 
lowest bidder and has a good track record. The company worked on the recently 
opened Century Freeway and the new upper deck of the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Loma Prieta earthquake, the firm was hired to reconstruct two 
quake-damaged bridges on California 1 at Watsonville. Given 100 days to 
complete the job, the company finished 40 days early, Bauer said, despite 
difficulties posed by the weather and terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Bauer said, work on the Santa Monica Freeway has been easier, 
even though it suffered two short setbacks.  
</P>
<P>
 First, workers unexpectedly encountered some old foundations that had to be 
removed. Then they found contaminated underground water, which had to be 
disposed of in accordance with strict state regulations. Myers estimated that 
those problems set the job back about 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had some bad luck," Myers said. Even so, he said, "there's no doubt 
we'll make it in less than 100 days." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments affecting the county's freeways, state transportation 
officials Thursday announced plans by Gov. Pete Wilson to accelerate a program 
of reinforcing 1,000 freeway bridges statewide that have been identified by 
state engineers as seismically unsafe. About 40% are in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Wilson signed an emergency measure speeding retrofit work on fewer 
than 100 unsafe bridges in the county that were damaged by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the comprehensive program announced by Dean R. Dunphy, secretary of the 
state Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, calls for legislation that 
will cut red tape and accelerate work on all unsafe bridges, assuring 
retrofitting of all by 1995. An additional 1,500 bridges across the state are 
being screened for a final time to determine whether any of them also will need 
reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 A comprehensive engineering analysis of bridges in 1992 by Caltrans identified 
716 in Los Angeles County that needed retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported last month that only 115 so far have been strengthened, or 
about 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 10 bridges rated the most hazardous in the county, six have not been 
retrofitted, including some of the county's busiest freeway junctures, such as 
the intersection of the Ventura and the Golden State freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said that strengthening of the junction should be finished within a 
year if the governor's plan is adopted by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest repair job ahead is reconstruction of the collapsed intersection 
of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways, which fell during the quake, 
killing a motorcycle patrol officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Demolition work is far ahead of schedule and almost completed, Roberts said. 
But extensive reconstruction will not be finished until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Freeway should be repaired by mid-May, Roberts said. The Gavin 
Canyon bridge over the Golden State freeway should be done by mid-June.

WHITE HOUSE AIDES TESTIFY ON WHITEWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton Administration lawyers delivered 1,000 pages of documents on the 
Whitewater case to a federal grand jury Thursday while three of six White House 
aides subpoenaed by the panel appeared at a federal courthouse to discuss 
controversial contacts between the White House and federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 The mounting distractions of Whitewater were apparent elsewhere in the capital 
as well. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told Congress of his department's 
effort to comply with the Whitewater special counsel's demands and President 
Clinton, speaking on crime in New York, lashed out at politicians and reporters 
who "twist (words) like taffy, to the nth degree." 
</P>
<P>
 In Little Rock, Ark., meanwhile, auditors from the Resolution Trust Corp. have 
begun examining more than $1 million in billings to the agency by the Rose Law 
Firm over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was prompted by reports that Rose was trying to determine 
whether former partner Webster Hubbell, a longtime Clinton friend and now the 
Justice Department's No. 3 official, had overbilled the RTC for work done by 
the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. had subpoenaed six White House aides and 
four current or former Treasury officials in search of evidence that contacts 
between them might have intruded improperly on the RTC's investigation of the 
Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske and the agency are looking into allegations that the President may have 
benefited improperly from his association with James B. McDougal, owner of the 
failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and partner with the President and First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater Development Corp. The company was 
established to develop a resort community in the Ozarks. Also under 
investigation is the role played by Mrs. Clinton and the Rose firm, in which 
she was a partner, in representing Whitewater and Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret A. Williams, Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff; Lisa Caputo, her press 
secretary, and Mark D. Gearan, the White House communications director, all 
braved a gantlet of photographers and reporters as they headed for a 
third-floor grand jury room in Washington's federal courthouse. Leaving after 2 
1/2 hours of testimony, Williams said she was "really encouraged to be 
participating in something where the finding of fact is important, as opposed 
to innuendo and rumormongering and gossip and sensationalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Caputo also gave testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, a gaggle of protesters, who said they represented conservative groups, 
held signs bearing slogans critical of the Administration. "Fess Up," one said. 
Another declared: "It's Ethics, Stupid."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Gearan showed up at the courthouse, it was unclear whether he was 
called to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a difficult day for people. It's been an emotional day," White 
House counselor David Gergen said later in a Cable News Network interview. 
Another senior White House official said the publicity surrounding Fiske's 
subpoenas had become "painful" for his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Klein, the White House counsel responsible for overseeing compliance with 
Fiske's subpoenas, appeared about 3:30 p.m. at the federal courthouse, carrying 
an attache case with memos, phone logs, letters and other documents related to 
the aides' contacts. Four hundred White House employees had been asked to look 
for germane documents and 30 to 40 of them had provided material that was 
passed on to Fiske. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President and the First Lady complied fully with the subpoenas," Klein 
told reporters, adding that the Clintons had not asserted executive privilege 
to withhold any papers. But he did not disclose whether the Clintons had any 
documents related to the contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Treasury Department plans to deliver a two-foot stack of 
documents to the grand jury today. Treasury officials explained that they had 
taken longer to round up the material because they needed to contact 
supervisors of the agency's 157,000 employees -- including customs employees in 
distant corners of the world -- to satisfy themselves that all relevant 
documents would be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before a House subcommittee, Bentsen said that his office was 
filled with auditors and investigators and that the agency had been forced to 
rent a warehouse to keep all the unsorted trash that officials thought might 
contain relevant material. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hesitate to say come look at my basement at Treasury, because someone would 
probably call me a pack rat," Bentsen said. "We've been holding back our trash 
to the point that I've had to use a warehouse . . . to hold the overflow." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the controversy surrounding the meetings is whether White House 
officials tried to interfere with the investigation by regulators or whether 
the Clintons were improperly informed of progress of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an RTC official said that the Little Rock audit would attempt to 
determine whether the bills from the Rose Law Firm were justified and the 
requested work done. The examination by a team of three auditors is expected to 
take several weeks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC audit brings more unwelcome scrutiny to the Rose firm, which already 
is under investigation by the special counsel's office for its possible 
involvement in the Whitewater case, for possibly destroying evidence. Mrs. 
Clinton and assistant White House counsel William H. Kennedy III also are 
former Rose partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald M. Clark, the firm's managing partner, did not return repeated 
telephone calls seeking comment on the RTC audit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, Hubbell had solicited work for Rose from the RTC, which 
handles the assets of failed savings and loans. The Rose firm was retained in 
1990 by the RTC to sue the accountants of the failed Madison Guaranty, whom the 
RTC accused of misrepresenting the financial condition of the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison was owned by McDougal, the Arkansas businessman with whom the Clintons 
invested in the Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's comments came in a seminar, as he talked about how the public 
debate over national affairs too often involves distortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how many people I've had -- older members of Congress -- tell me 
in the last week how much meaner and more partisan and negative the national 
arena is," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, Democrats went on the attack after a week of reacting 
defensively to mounting Republican demands for a congressional investigation of 
Whitewater. Several defended the Clintons and criticized Republicans for what 
they said is a politically motivated attempt to paralyze the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Rallying around Mrs. Clinton, the Democrats also chastised Republicans for 
alleging that the First Lady may have been guilty of wrongdoing in Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a USA Today-CNN-Gallup telephone poll conducted Monday and Tuesday 
found that 60% of those surveyed believed that Clinton did something unethical 
or illegal in Whitewater. Fifty-six percent believed that of Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But another poll, by NBC and the Wall Street Journal, found that only 16% said 
they believed that Clinton had "committed financial wrongdoing." Thirty-four 
percent said the issue was "just being used for political purposes" and 41% 
said they "don't know enough to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Michael Ross contributed to this story. Did the White House 
Intrude? 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is questioning current and former Clinton Administration 
officials to see if they tried to interfere with the investigation of the 
failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, a thrift owned by a former business

</P>
<P>
 Special counsel: Robert B. Fiske Jr. is probing matters related to the 
financial affairs of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, their Whitewater land 
development partner James B. McDougal, and McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings 
& Loan, which failed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of at least $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 His staff: Fiske has assembled a staff of eight current or former prosecutors 
and more than 20 FBI agents and financial analysts to review more than a 
million documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Inquiries beyond D.C. grand jury: Fiske has established a special grand jury 
in Little Rock, Ark., with an 18-month term, and a separate arm of his staff is 
in Washington to investigate the suicide of White House deputy counsel Vincent 
Foster, who handled Whitewater matters for the Clintons. The Grand Jury 
</P>
<P>
 What they do: Grand juries meet in secret to hear evidence of possible 
criminal wrongdoing. Prosecutors are empowered to issue subpoenas to compel 
witnesses to testify under oath or turn over documents. A majority of the 
quorum of 16 members is needed to bring an indictment -- which is an 
allegation, not a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the secrecy: It is designed to protect reputations of people who are 
investigated but never charged. Grand jurors an prosecutors are bound by 
secrecy, but witnesses and their lawyers are free to discuss the testimony.

SOME GRUMBLE, BUT MOST PRAISE HARDER STATE TESTS; SCHOOLS: OFFICIALS COMPLAIN 
OF GLITCHES OR SAY STANDARDS ARE TOO HIGH. BUT MANY SEE RESULTS, THOUGH DISMAL, 
AS USEFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the dismal results produced by California's pioneering new student 
performance tests offered a bitter pill to public school educators and parents 
this week, not everyone was willing to take the medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the state's biggest teachers union complained that the math 
questions were too hard. Many school district officials said students and 
teachers were not given adequate time to prepare. Others griped that the 
state's new performance standards were too high and that the scoring method was 
too subjective. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two school districts won an admission that some of their reported 
scores were in error, and several other districts have asked state testing 
officials to check into possible mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the architects of the new testing system said the public seems to be 
taking heed of what the scores say about the need to improve schools and are 
focusing on how to make them better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been pleased that the response by teachers and school administrators has 
not been overly defensive," said state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), a 
teacher whose legislation gave birth to the new system of testing, which 
measures student performance against tough standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are concerns . . . but I am not seeing the kind of backlash I was 
concerned about. People are not saying these (tests) are fundamentally flawed . 
. . and that is healthy and encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say the first scores from the new system have not stirred 
dismay -- and some confusion -- throughout the state. For the first time, 
student work was judged against a series of tough standards -- a sharp 
departure from past practice of comparing districts and schools against each 
other. Many were shocked by the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Few students attained the new higher standards in reading and writing, and in 
math California's public school students were found to be very deficient. The 
standards were developed by a task force that included business leaders, school 
board members, testing experts and educators. They were approved by the State 
Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry M. Weinberg, superintendent of the San Diego County Office of Education, 
which advises 43 public school districts in that county, said the response to 
the tests has been positive.  
</P>
<P>
 "We feel challenged by the results, but at least now we know what we have to 
shoot for, and that is great," Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a reference to the tight budgets that school districts have been 
experiencing since the state slipped into recession nearly five years ago, he 
added: 
</P>
<P>
 "The only downside is that we need the resources to help us meet this good 
goal. We've been given this beautiful new racecourse and told to complete it in 
record time with an old Chevy." 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen DiMarco, Gov. Pete Wilson's secretary for child development and 
education, found a similar reaction Thursday when she addressed a Bay Area 
meeting of 35 superintendents from districts throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some talk about problems with (the testing system), but that was a 
secondary discussion for them. This is awkward and uncomfortable, and there is 
some concern about the reliability (of) parts of it," DiMarco said. "But they 
were in favor of having these high, clear standards; they were very focused on 
how to do better." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, criticisms of at least some aspects of the testing system were abundant 
in the aftermath of the public's first look at the scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Weber, president of the California Teachers Assn., which has been an 
enthusiastic backer of the testing system, said the way results were released 
was confusing and the volume of data made it seem as if the tests "mean more 
than they really do." 
</P>
<P>
 Weber, whose union is in the middle of an advertising campaign touting school 
improvements, advocated a return to rankings based on school-to-school 
comparisons. He said it will take five years of testing and refinement before 
the results will be meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want the whole process discredited," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weber said the math questions may have been too tough. The math portions 
of the test required students to diagram and explain their thinking about 
real-life problems, eschewing the typical battery of arithmetic exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure all those math questions should have been asked of the average 
high school student," he said. "A majority of our students are not going on to 
college . . . and certainly not to the University of California." 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of mathematics teachers and university professors disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have, to our great distress, not held ourselves to high standards in the 
past, and we have got to be doing much better," said Kenneth C. Millett, a UC 
Santa Barbara math professor and member of the California Coalition for 
Mathematics and Science, which strongly supports the new standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The math test and the standards are supported even in districts where students 
fared among the worst, including the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
There, more than 80% of the students showed only "limited mathematical 
thinking," attaining only the first rung or two of the test's six-tiered ladder 
of achievement standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The test is reliable," said Amy McKenna, the district's director of 
instruction. "It does give us a picture of where we are and where we need to 
go. They are not too high for what is going to be expected of our students" as 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Sid Thompson, the district's superintendent, also did not object to the 
standards, but he argued that the low scores do not take into account the 
hardships that many of the district's 640,000 students bring to the classroom. 
The district has high proportions of students who live in poverty or who have 
limited English fluency, both of which have been shown to be important factors 
in academic performance, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Genethia Hayes of Project Ahead, which works with parents in 10 of the 
district's inner-city schools, said the problem is not the standards, which 
ought to be high, but the continuing unwillingness or inability of schools to 
help struggling families overcome the obstacles to achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we know the home situation is the greatest factor in success," said Hayes, 
"then why are we not doing more to reach out to parents in ways that help them 
understand what is needed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Bruns, the parent of a student at Palisades High School in Pacific 
Palisades, said she disliked the old, multiple choice-based tests but also has 
criticism for the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old tests were a total crock," Bruns said. "I have not spent a lot of 
time studying (the new tests), but I have a feeling they will need to do a lot 
of work on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Problems in scoring have also surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Results in two Orange County schools -- Corona del Mar High in Newport Beach 
and Fred Newhart Elementary in Mission Viejo -- were thrown into doubt when the 
private company that processed the results acknowledged it had discovered a 
problem in response to challenges by the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, officials of the Downey Unified School District complained of 
missing writing scores and discrepancies in the numbers of students taking the 
math and reading tests, which they believe skewed the results. 
</P>
<P>
 State testing officials said they are investigating about 15 such complaints 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Shelton, a consultant on the testing system, said his office also is 
getting questions regarding the fact that not all the tests were scored. To 
save money, the state scored 40% to 60% of the tests, depending on the subject 
and grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the sample of tests used was more than sufficient to produce reliable 
results. He noted that when individual student scores are added to the system, 
beginning this spring, all the tests will be scored.

NORTHROP OFFERS $2 BILLION IN RIVAL BID FOR GRUMMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wave of consolidations sweeping America's defense industry turned 
aggressive Thursday as Northrop Corp. launched a $2-billion offer to snatch 
Grumman Corp. away from Martin Marietta, which agreed earlier this week to buy 
the firm for $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 If Northrop succeeds, it will have substantially improved its chances of 
surviving as an independent company in what will be a brutal industry 
contraction over the next few years. The alternative raises the risk that 
Northrop, which is based in Century City, might ultimately be swallowed up by a 
predator. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has encouraged the defense industry to eliminate some of the 
excess production facilities that are driving up weapons costs and hurting the 
international standing of U.S. contractors. The Pentagon would prefer two or 
three healthy combat aircraft producers instead of seven companies barely 
surviving on ever-diminishing government budgets. Moreover, a stronger U.S. 
industry will be more globally dominant, theoretically lowering the Pentagon's 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the downsizing is accompanied by deep pain for employees who will lose 
their jobs and for communities that are likely to see large industrial plants 
close permanently. Industry analysts have estimated that 10,000 to 15,000 jobs 
could be eliminated in a merger of Grumman with another firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman spokesman Robert Harwood declined to answer questions about the 
Northrop offer, but Martin Marietta issued a harshly worded rebuttal, asserting 
that it "is deeply disappointed that Northrop has chosen to launch a hostile 
attack that seeks to disrupt" a friendly merger. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta added that "the attack by Northrop degrades the entire 
character of the rational consolidation taking place within the United States 
national security industrial base." 
</P>
<P>
 The tough talk reflects a dramatic change in what has been a gentlemanly 
business, where chief executives often fraternize with one another and talk 
about common goals. Although mergers have been taking place for several years, 
none has been hostile and now for the first time prime contractors are trying 
to eat other prime contractors in a battle for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop denied that it was making a hostile bid. But after failing in two 
previous efforts to acquire companies amid a rapid shrinkage of the defense 
business, Northrop signaled Thursday that it is ready for a tough fight to win 
Grumman, a longstanding manufacturer of Navy aircraft that has highly regarded 
electronics technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to remaining a player in the defense industry, and this 
merger will make us an even larger and more important player," Northrop Chief 
Executive Kent Kresa said. "This is a very positive development for Northrop 
and Grumman." 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting company would have sales of about $8 billion, a bit short of the 
$8.5 billion to $10 billion defense sales of its biggest rivals -- Lockheed and 
McDonnell Douglas. But it would have substantial technology in important areas 
such as aircraft surveillance, Stealth and electronic systems. Northrop has 
about 30,000 employees and Grumman has 18,000, concentrated near its 
headquarters on New York's Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa said it was too early to know how a Northrop-Grumman merger would affect 
the two firm's employment or facilities, although he acknowledged, "There will 
be some things that make sense to put together, that's what restructuring this 
industry is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at Northrop's Hawthorne facility said Thursday's announcement caught 
many of them off-guard, although some expressed optimism that the deal might 
help Northrop grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not concerned," said Terry McQueary, 47, who has worked as a planner for 
Northrop for 13 years. "It's a good time for anybody to make investments now." 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman, however, is already closing some of its facilities on Long Island and 
moving final production of its last aircraft program, the Navy E-2C radar 
plane, to a newer facility in Florida. Northrop, meanwhile, has announced that 
it will close its B-2 bomber plant in Pico Rivera in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent appeal to Grumman employees, Northrop said it would change its 
name to Northrop Grumman Corp. if the acquisition deal goes through. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its acquisition plan, Northrop will offer Grumman shareholders $60 per 
share starting Monday, $5 a share more than the Martin Marietta bid announced 
Monday. Northrop said it has arranged financing commitments from Chase 
Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank for $2.8 billion, providing a huge cushion if 
the company has to match higher offers by Martin Marietta or other potential 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta also has financing that allows higher offers, but its bank 
agreements would top out at about $70 per share, while Northrop could go all 
the way to $80 -- although such a high price is seen as unlikely, said BT 
Securities analyst Wolfgang Demisch. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop had been discussing a possible merger with Grumman for about a year, 
but the company reached a deal with Martin Marietta without allowing Northrop 
to submit any counteroffer, Kresa said in a terse letter to Grumman Chairman 
Renso Caporali. 
</P>
<P>
 "We and our representatives have been negotiating with Grumman in good faith 
since early December, responding to Grumman's clear statements that it was not 
for sale," Kresa wrote. "Now it appears . . . that we were not playing on a 
level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa also asserted that some aspects of the deal struck by Martin Marietta 
are "improper and illegal," referring to an agreement under which Grumman must 
pay Martin Marietta $50 million if its offer is exceeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa declined to say whether the company was prepared for a court fight over 
the issue and did not have any explanation of why Grumman did not want to allow 
Northrop to submit a bid. The two firms have collaborated on various projects, 
including a losing bid for the now-defunct Navy A-12 attack jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa said that based on its $2-billion offer, the deal would not hurt 
Northrop's earnings, and that potential cost savings resulting from the merger 
could add to future profitability. He indicated it was likely he would seek an 
agreement from the Pentagon to share those savings, which normally go to the 
Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional debt could be quickly reduced, he said. Initially, Northrop's 
debt would jump to 63% of its total capital, but would drop below 50% by the 
end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace analysts said a Northrop-Grumman merger would create a formidable 
competitor in the defense industry, although an obvious weakness is that all 
the large aircraft programs at both firms are due to expire before 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combination of Northrop and Grumman is potentially a powerhouse 
technologically and financially," Demisch said. "But it needs the glue of some 
extra contracts." 
</P>
<P>
 But Northrop's appetite to grow may not be satisfied by Grumman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other consolidations that need to take place and we will want to 
continue to play in this," Kresa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Thursday, defense deals were largely for divisions or subsidiaries of 
other companies. Lockheed, for example, bought General Dynamics' Ft. Worth 
fighter aircraft unit and Hughes Aircraft bought General Dynamics' missile 
business. But now the defense downsizing will mean that whole companies will be 
swallowed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa said the Grumman acquisition would significantly enhance Northrop's 
strategy of focusing on three critical areas: combat aircraft, electronics 
systems and commercial aircraft structures. The Grumman presence, Kresa said, 
would give Northrop a broad and integrated product line. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop would also stand to gain strength in Congress, an area in which it 
has long held a weak hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big plus for Northrop in terms of its political clout," said Booz 
Allen Hamilton consultant John Harbison.  
</P>
<P>
 Harbison said that the U.S. aerospace industry's consolidation is improving 
its competitive position so much that European nations are now clearly worried 
about the potential strength that U.S. firms will bring to the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see their industry losing their competitive edge and losing their 
critical mass," Harbison said. "We have really pulled away from Europe. And to 
the extent we improve our world position, it helps the U.S. government because 
it lowers their costs." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of their work shift in Hawthorne on Thursday afternoon, employees 
were handed a one-page announcement explaining Northrop's bid. Employees said 
it was too early to gauge what effect the potential acquisition of Grumman 
might have on their jobs, although many tried to view it in the best possible 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe it'll be good for us," McQueary said. "You have to see it as a 
business opportunity for us that could save jobs rather than cost jobs."

CIA OFFICIALS BLAMED FOR SPY CASE DAMAGE; ESPIONAGE: CONGRESSIONAL REVIEWS OF 
AMES AFFAIR SEE BREAKDOWN OF PLAN TO PREVENT NATIONAL SECURITY BREACHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After a series of closed-door sessions, congressional reviews of the Ames spy 
case tentatively have concluded that top CIA officials were to blame for damage 
caused by a suspected mole's sale of national security secrets to the Soviet 
Union, according to ranking members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate and House intelligence committees are grimly piecing together what is 
now widely described as a painful breakdown by top CIA officials of a plan to 
prevent security breaches of the kind posed by accused spy Aldrich H. Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames and his wife, Rosario, might have been caught years earlier if the CIA 
had fully complied with a 1988 memo of understanding with the FBI on internal 
security, the chairmen of both committees said in interviews. Negotiated and 
approved by the two agencies after a wave of spy disclosures in the mid-1980s, 
the memo outlines a comprehensive security process to ferret out such threats. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of following it by promptly alerting the FBI, which is responsible 
for counterintelligence investigations, to a series of warning signals, top CIA 
officials kept their suspicions inside the agency, the chairmen said. When they 
later did call in the FBI, not enough information or access was provided to do 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA lapsed into a traditional cloak-and-dagger "culture of secrecy," said 
Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intelligence people have a hard time being straightforward, up front with 
legitimate law enforcement investigations that deal with their areas, in this 
case counterespionage," DeConcini said.  
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said 
that, because the CIA repeated mistakes of the past, the Ames case was "a 
catastrophe waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, at one time chief of Soviet counterintelligence in the CIA's Soviet-East 
European division, and his wife were arrested Feb. 21 on charges that they 
conspired to commit espionage. They allegedly were paid an estimated $2.5 
million beginning in 1985 to spy for the Soviet Union and later Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple is accused of revealing the identities of U.S. agents, causing the 
deaths of at least 10 sources helping the United States abroad and vastly 
compromising CIA intelligence efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both houses of Congress are now looking into reports that specific information 
about Ames known by CIA officials was not fully disclosed to the FBI at several 
critical junctures. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, the CIA is not being completely forthcoming about 
counterintelligence and security vulnerabilities, the intelligence committee 
chairmen said. The agency's reluctance, which they attributed to an apparent 
attempt to protect intelligence tactics and personnel, is hindering the 
congressional investigations, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agency is still being defensive," DeConcini said. "Trying to get 
information the last couple of days has been like trying to pull teeth without 
permission. It's hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Ames investigation was launched during the George Bush 
Administration, CIA Director R. James Woolsey, a Clinton appointee, is coming 
under increasing criticism. "Woolsey has been a little reluctant to talk to us 
about the extent of the damage," Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several U.S. officials have noted that, before he became CIA chief, Woolsey 
served on a commission that recommended steps to tighten protection against 
moles. But as director, the officials said, Woolsey largely has failed to 
follow through on those recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers also expressed amazement this week that several top agency officials 
have been promoted by Woolsey, despite apparent lapses in oversight of Ames. 
Among those whose roles are being questioned by lawmakers are Hugh E. (Ted) 
Price and Thomas Twetton, former senior officials in the CIA operations 
directorate who directly supervised Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional sources are now suggesting that major personnel changes may be 
necessary at the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It requires some very strong medicine and that deals with people," DeConcini 
said. "I'm not fingering anybody and I'm not saying who should be considered 
for replacement. But obviously there are some problems there that are hard to 
explain." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of congressional hearings, there is a growing demand for 
legislative action. In the Senate, the Intelligence Committee is preparing 
measures to give the FBI greater power to investigate the financial records of 
intelligence employees. Those measures include FBI access to tax statements, 
bank transactions, credit cards, mutual funds and other personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.) introduced a bill requiring 
leading intelligence officials to file financial disclosure statements each 
year. Heflin said that his intent is "to expose sudden, unexplained or 
incongruent financial gain or holdings to agency review." 
</P>
<P>
 But for someone engaged in espionage, there is no guarantee of truthfulness. 
Ames, for example, lied each year on his federal income tax return, omitting 
his extra income and failing to report his five foreign bank accounts, 
according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters after his appearance before the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, Woolsey promised close cooperation with Congress, the FBI and other 
executive branch agencies in their investigations. He also outlined three steps 
that the CIA will take as it examines the issue: 
</P>
<P>
 * A review of security and counterintelligence policy and procedures by a 
security panel with assistance from Brent Scowcroft, White House national 
security adviser under Bush; former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and W. 
Douglas Gow, former associate deputy director of the FBI for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 * A thorough damage assessment overseen by Rich Haver, a high-ranking 
intelligence official. 
</P>
<P>
 * An independent inquiry by CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz to address 
counterintelligence practices and procedures as they relate to the Ames case. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey called CIA cooperation with the FBI in the case "exemplary" and said 
that he expects it to remain so. "This espionage case is serious," Woolsey 
said. "I will not tolerate excuses or lethargy about these matters and I will 
not offer excuses to our committee or to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate, under pressure from the Justice Department not to conduct an 
independent investigation that might jeopardize prosecution of the Ameses, has 
agreed to a compromise under which Hitz will conduct an investigation and 
report to Congress.

COLUMN ONE; JAPANESE LEARNING TO JUST SAY NO; BUCKING A TRADITION OF AMBIGUITY, 
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MORE DEFINITIVELY DISAGREE -- AT HOME AND AT THE 
NEGOTIATING TABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The year was 1969. President Richard Nixon asked Prime Minister Eisaku Sato to 
impose quotas on textile exports in exchange for the return of Okinawa. Sato 
used a notoriously ambiguous phrase -- "Zensho shimasu" -- which can be 
translated as "I'll take a proper step," or "I'll take a favorable action," but 
often means rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Sato later denied promising quotas, and Nixon spent more than two years 
bludgeoning Japan into accepting them. The incident severely damaged U.S.-Japan 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese reluctance to give a clear, definitive no has confused countless 
other foreigners and snarled international interactions, from casual chats to 
trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambiguity of the Japanese no is so famous that President Clinton, at a 
dinner last year in Vancouver, Canada, with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, 
scribbled this advice to him: "When the Japanese say yes, they mean no." 
</P>
<P>
 But times are changing. Five years after flamboyant legislator Shintaro 
Ishihara urged his nation to stand up to Washington in his controversial book, 
"The Japan That Can Say No," Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa did just that by 
resoundingly rejecting U.S. demands for measurable trade targets in his recent 
summit meeting with Clinton in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no hemming or hawing in the language Japanese negotiators used to 
reject the proposed targets. They said, " Totei doi dekimasen ," or "There is 
no way I can agree with that," according to translator Mariko Nagai, who has 
worked on dozens of U.S.-Japan trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a bit scared about interpreting it, because the language was so clear," 
Nagai said. She said she has seen a trend toward sharper language among 
Japanese negotiators in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's definitive no to Clinton, widely applauded here as a sign of 
Japan's coming of age, symbolizes a shift away from the soft, indirect 
expressions that Japanese have long used to maintain harmony and save face with 
one another. As contact with foreigners increases and the tradition that frowns 
on direct expression weakens, more Japanese are learning to speak more clearly 
and daring to disagree -- in daily life as well as in the international arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Assertiveness seminars and debate training are being imported from the West 
and gaining popularity -- especially among women. Debating skills are being 
formally promoted in the classroom for the first time by the Ministry of 
Education, whose centralized curricula have focused on rote memorization rather 
than on self-expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers are being encouraged to say no to high prices and sales pressure 
tactics. One Tokyo consumer service center has launched a campaign to promote 
"the courage to say no" to salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 The mass media are weighing in with such articles as "Become an Employee Who 
Can Say NO." "The yesman is being weeded out," declared Spa, a trendy men's 
magazine. ". . . If you can't clearly communicate your will, you won't win in 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Such blunt advice bucks centuries of communication techniques designed to 
soften denials with subtlety and understatement, by providing hints and relying 
on the other person to intuitively fathom the real meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 (Certainly, blunt speech has always existed in Japan -- clear orders by the 
boss to the underling, or many husbands to their wives, for example. But to 
casual friends and other acquaintances, Japanese have often spoken obliquely.) 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows why such subtleties of speech developed. The prevailing theory is 
that they sprang from a need for people to get along in this crowded island 
nation. Another common explanation is the Confucian system of hierarchical 
human relations, which makes it difficult for subordinates to say no not only 
in Japan but also in such countries as Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Kikuo Nomoto, a Japanese language expert, said the nation's long history of 
repressive rule, from the feudalism of the Tokugawa Shogunate to the militarism 
of the early to mid-1900s, also stifled expression.  
</P>
<P>
 "The feudal government did not permit criticism, so people developed 
techniques to hide their real feelings," Nomoto said. 
</P>
<P>
 The influence of politics on expression is particularly apparent in the Kyoto 
area, experts say. Some Kyoto phrases carry completely different meanings from 
their surface appearance. To be asked to stay for dinner, for instance, 
actually means "Please go home." Many Tokyoites say Kyoto expressions are the 
most difficult to understand in all of Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 Kyoto Women's University Prof. Kazumasa Hoshino explained that Kyoto was the 
seat of government and center of imperial rule for more than 1,000 years. To 
protect themselves from the many changes of government and to avoid making 
enemies, people learned to cloak their language in niceties and used extreme 
caution in admitting people into their inner circles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, many first-class restaurants in Kyoto won't serve first-time 
visitors without an introduction from a regular customer. The unwitting visitor 
will merely be told that all seats are filled. 
</P>
<P>
 The most provocative theory about the reluctance to say no comes from Yoshimi 
Ishikawa, a novelist and social commentator. He says many Japanese avoid giving 
a clear yes and no because they lack certain absolute values. 
</P>
<P>
 "Westerners have . . . the law of the Bible. In Japan, our god has been our 
emperor, who has never given us any absolute laws. All he says is, ' Ah, so? ' 
('Is that so?') 
</P>
<P>
 "When our absolute value is 'Ah so,' how can we say yes or no?" Ishikawa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such patterns of communication will not be transformed overnight. But sheer 
necessity is fostering some change. 
</P>
<P>
 Nori Shikata learned to say no as a high school exchange student with a 
Midwestern farm family in the early 1980s. Before going to the United States, 
he was told that saying no clearly -- declining a party invitation, for 
instance -- would avoid misunderstandings and not offend Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Shikata, who went on to become a bureaucrat, said directness was the most 
difficult thing he had to learn in the United States. But now he can state his 
views on any number of issues -- and Japan is producing more people like him. 
The number of exchange students going abroad grew to 185,888 in 1990 from 
23,149 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Exchange students return to Japan with a remarkable ability to speak their 
minds, said Junko Kawano of the AFS Japan Assn. exchange program. Although they 
have to readjust to Japanese society, causing initial hardship, the end result 
is that more people can maneuver in both foreign and Japanese situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Training in debate is not limited to those who go overseas. On a recent 
morning at the Ichikawa City Elementary School in the Tokyo suburb of Chiba, 
the second-grade class of Junko Sakuma took an adventure in the art of debate 
with this topic: Do dogs or cats make better pets? 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about tiptoeing around another person's feelings. The verbal jousting 
was fierce, said a recent account in Aera magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The cat side: "Cats have fluffy fur and are cute." 
</P>
<P>
 The dog side: "But not all cats are fluffy!" 
</P>
<P>
 The cat side: "Dogs bark and make a racket." 
</P>
<P>
 The dog side: "But if you train them, they'll be OK!" 
</P>
<P>
 Such classroom debates are spreading, thanks to the Ministry of Education's 
new directive to encourage self-expression and foster debate skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers were first instructed to place priority on speaking skills in a 1989 
ministry directive: "In this era of internationalization, it is necessary for 
children to express their own ideas themselves and communicate them to others." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, newly issued sixth-grade textbooks contained the first-ever 
instruction in rhetorical skills: a lesson called "Let's Debate!" Beginning 
next month, high school students will be able to fulfill an oral communication 
requirement with a debate class. 
</P>
<P>
 More universities too are using debate as a teaching technique. Keio 
University Prof. Atsushi Kusano, who employs it in his class on modern Japanese 
politics, said more people are becoming accustomed to debate through Western 
news shows beamed here, such as the "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" and Cable News 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said people are becoming frustrated with the government's reliance on 
foreign pressure to enact domestic changes and want to debate the issues and 
decide their policies for themselves. That attitude is exemplified by 
politicians such as Ichiro Ozawa, one of the key leaders of the Hosokawa 
coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
 In business as well, debate and assertiveness training are gaining converts. 
Tsutomu Hamaoka, a manager for the Fuji Photo Film Co., began teaching debate 
skills to his department last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamaoka said the exercises of tallying up pros versus cons, or using a devil's 
advocate to provoke deeper thought, may seem routine to Westerners but is 
radical stuff to many Japanese. Many decisions rely more on "feeling" or 
"intuition" than hardheaded logic, he said. Although Westerners are able to 
separate attacks on their ideas from attacks on them personally, Japanese find 
that difficult and thus shun confrontation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no cultural parallel to the devil's advocate in Japan," said 
Michihiro Matsumoto, president of the Management Development Institute, which 
sponsors debate training seminars. "Japanese feel that if you disagree with 
their theories, you are disagreeing with their personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome that feeling, debate trainees are told they are merely playing a 
role unrelated to their true selves. 
</P>
<P>
 Assertiveness training is perhaps even more subversive than are debate 
lessons. Self-assertion has long been frowned upon as selfish -- and American 
-- in a society that requires conformism. 
</P>
<P>
 Now such seminars are in demand by everyone from homemakers to corporate 
managers, said Noriko Hiraki, a social science professor at Japan Women's 
University. She runs seminars privately and for the Psycho Technology Institute 
of Japan, which has tripled the number of seminars and doubled the size of 
classes since its first workshop 10 years ago but still has waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, many of her clients wanted to learn assertiveness because they 
were being transferred abroad. Nowadays, she said, most of the demand is for 
teaching Japanese to speak more assertively to other Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiraki said the old form of ishin denshin, or tacit communication, in which 
both sides know what the other means without being direct, is breaking down. 
Managers are also feeling a growing generation gap with younger people, who are 
less intimidated by seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays, if you ask your young staff members to go out for a drink after 
work, they'll say they have other plans," said Fuji's Hamaoka, 53. "When I 
started out 30 years ago, we would change our plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Nomoto, the language specialist, said young people are losing the ability to 
understand established code phrases for no -- such as "I'll think about it." 
"They come back a week later and ask if you've thought about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinobu Omiya, a 30-year-old office worker for a publishing firm, said her 
generation still ponders excuses before saying no but doesn't really seem to 
need the crutch anymore. But some say this is more a product of bad manners 
than of increased self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are the most conspicuous recruits in the move to learn to say no. Hiraki 
said 70% of her students are female. At one Keio University debate last year, 
all the captains of the 10 debate teams in Kusano's class were women. 
</P>
<P>
 For women conditioned to just say yes, Hiraki's lessons have brought small but 
significant triumphs: the homemaker who said no to a persistent newspaper 
salesperson for the first time in her life; the woman who finally declined a 
friend's invitation to eat at a restaurant she didn't enjoy; the wife who told 
her husband she really wanted to take a bath when he called for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Nozomi Yokoyama, 28, and Kazuko Oura, 26, recently took debate lessons. 
Learning the skills of cool, objective analysis will help their careers, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arata Sato, a Keio University student in environmental studies, said Japanese 
will continue to speak more softly than Westerners but that the era of 
compliance and unvoiced opinions is ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "More women want to continue work after marriage or having children, and we 
have to debate this with our husbands and bosses," she said. "Unless we have 
our own clear way of thinking and can explain it skillfully, we won't be 
persuasive." 
</P>

MEANS: It's impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 PHRASE: Doryoku shimasu. LITERAL MEANING: I'll try OFTEN MEANS: Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 PHRASE: Zensho shimasu. LITERAL MEANING: I'll take a proper step. OFTEN MEANS: 
I won' have anything to do with that anymore.

COMPUTER ABCS FOR CEOS; EXECUTIVES BEAT TECHNO-PHOBIA AT O.C. RETREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It may come as no surprise that many chief executives of major corporations 
are computer-illiterate. The higher up they are, the more embarrassing it can 
be to come out of the closet and seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was with gritted teeth that 31 CEOs came to a $5,500-per-person retreat 
in Orange County this week to admit their techno-phobia and learn to use 
gadgets from personal computers to voice mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm borderline computer-illiterate," said Russell E. Christiansen, chief 
executive of Midwest Resources Inc., an electric and gas utility in Des Moines, 
Iowa. "I thought I better get on with it. I can't be the last one in our 
organization to learn how to use a computer." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Christiansen, one of every three executives attending the seminar said 
they don't use computers at work or at home, said Robert Burns, chief executive 
of the CEO Institutes, a training company that sponsors the seminars along with 
software publisher Computer Associates International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel resort in Dana Point was the 
third in a series of retreats the company has staged for chief executives from 
around the world. It is part of a crusade against the dangers of "technology 
disconnect" between business people and the technology experts they 
increasingly depend on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to show that it isn't so complicated," said Charles Wang, chief 
executive of Computer Associates in Islandia, N.Y. "We're trying to take the 
intimidation out. We're also saying that if you want to use technology as a 
competitive advantage, you have to take the technology up into executive 
management. " 
</P>
<P>
 While their spouses toil away at personal finance programs at home and their 
secretaries become wizards of word processing, some chief executives may have 
been left out of the computer revolution. They've conquered business skills but 
are often too proud to ask for help about computers. Still, they make 
multimillion-dollar decisions when investing in technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel R. Nelson, chief executive of West One Bancorp, a regional bank based 
in Boise, Idaho, with $7.4 billion in assets, said he came to the seminar 
because he spends $2 million a year buying computer equipment he cannot fathom. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of our largest expenditures and it has come to control our lives," 
he said. "I'm always terrified we're going down a blind alley. I've got to 
learn it or I'm going to get run over by it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the seminar, the executives learn along with their technology-shy peers in 
a comfortable, non-threatening environment. Each is assigned a personal adviser 
in case he or she gets lost in the computer world. 
</P>
<P>
 They joke about how they had talked themselves into thinking that you can't 
teach an old dog new tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald S. Freeman, president of Dallas-based Freeman Cos., a $250-million 
company with 1,500 employees that organizes trade shows, said he balked at 
computer manuals that were thicker than the instruction books for the corporate 
planes he pilots.  
</P>
<P>
 Others go to great lengths to hide their lack of knowledge. Carlos Tan, chief 
executive of Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. in San Diego, said he gets his secretary 
to print out his electronic mail. But he never asks her any questions.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm completely illiterate," he said. "For me, this is practical because we're 
about to invest some money in a new computer system." 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar begins with the basics because more than a few executives are 
clueless. 
</P>
<P>
 One man, when asked to activate his computer mouse -- the ubiquitous, 
hand-directed pointing device that controls a moving cursor on a monitor -- 
tried to place it on the computer screen. At the seminar, such faux pas are 
forgiven. Not so at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK if you look bad here," Nelson said. "It's embarrassing back at the 
office. If I went back and said people could only communicate with me by 
electronic mail, I imagine it would be pretty quiet for a couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
 Semi-savvy executives find that the minimum requirement for "computer 
literacy" keeps rising. Margaret S. Wilson, chief executive of the Scarboroughs 
department store chain in Austin, Texas, said she takes her portable computer 
wherever she goes, but only to type in notes. She wants to be a power user. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have programs on my computer that I don't know how to use, like 
spreadsheets or electronic mail," she said. "I'm a frequent user, but not a 
sophisticated one." 
</P>
<P>
 For older executives, learning about PCs is like trying to jump across a 
generation gap. But watching their children play Nintendo games or program 
their videocassette recorders makes some curious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I visited a generating station we own and there was an operator in his 50s 
who was pointing and clicking his way through a computer-control program," 
Christiansen said. "I figured if he could do it, I could." 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-morning Thursday, the tutors had walked the executives through lessons 
on word processing, electronic mail, spreadsheets and personal finance. After 
the initial instruction, Nelson of West One Bancorp scored 16 out of 23 on a 
multiple-choice test of basic computer terminology, such as the meaning of 
"word processor" (a device that allows people to create and edit documents). 
Nelson's score was considered average. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really as difficult as I made myself believe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not such a great leap from using a computer to talking intelligently 
about their use in corporations or making decisions about how to use such 
technology as a competitive tool. 
</P>
<P>
 It's good to know, for instance, that computers can cause antisocial behavior 
like prompting salespeople to communicate with customers electronically instead 
of in person, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember when we didn't have a fax machine in our sawmills," said 
Charles Godfrey, president of Canal Industries Inc., a forest products company 
in Conway, S.C. "The good old days are a memory."

FITNESS FIRMS HIT HOME; MARKETING: EXERCISE EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS ARE 
CAPITALIZING ON THE TREND AWAY FROM HEALTH CLUBS WITH HOME-USE VERSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The machines are getting smarter. 
</P>
<P>
 A treadmill can track your heart rate and automatically turn up the intensity 
if you're not working hard enough. A stair-step machine catches cheaters who 
lean on the handrails in order to seem to weigh less. And today's stationary 
bicycle ratchets down its degree of difficulty to compensate for the 
out-of-shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these features are familiar to people who frequent well-to-do health 
clubs. What's new is that consumers will now find such features on exercise 
equipment for the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers, having established a reputation supplying health clubs, are 
rapidly expanding into the home fitness market. Irvine-based Unisen, which 
makes Star Trac equipment, one of the best-selling treadmills in the world, in 
January introduced an in-home treadmill and stair-step machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Tectrix Fitness Equipment, also based in Irvine, has been scaling down the 
size of its ClimbMax stair-stepper to fit easily into a den or bedroom. Life 
Fitness, maker of the 15-year-old Lifecycle, said that it will introduce nearly 
a dozen cycles and other workout machines for home use within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Home gyms are becoming more popular for several reasons. The population is 
aging, and health clubs are perceived as places for the young. Aging 
baby-boomers have grown up with the conviction that energy and stamina are 
gained by regular exercise. And the physically fit have grown accustomed to the 
commercial machines they use during gym visits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six million folks are leaving health clubs each year," said Michael Blyth, 
executive vice president of marketing for Life Fitness. "That gives us an 
opportunity to capitalize on our name." 
</P>
<P>
 While a constant stream of new members keeps the health club population steady 
at about 16.5 million, he said, the number of home gyms has grown 34%, from 6.1 
million to 8 million, in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 While "home gym" sounds elaborate, the setup can be as simple as a single 
machine that gives its user a cardiovascular workout -- raising the heart rate 
to at least 60% of its maximum performance. Doctors recommend such exercise for 
a minimum of 20 minutes three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Shari Lewis bought a treadmill in January to encourage her husband to exercise 
more. The couple, who live in Corona del Mar, are in their 50s. 
</P>
<P>
 She bought the Star Trac 900, Unisen's first treadmill priced under $3,000 
(it's $2,995), and placed it three feet from their bed, "in front of the TV." 
She said that got her husband's attention. "He can't ignore it this way," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that she and her husband avoid health clubs. "There would be no way 
my husband would go before work or on his way home," Lewis said. Besides, she 
said, "people in the gym are all in their 20s -- real buff or tall and thin." 
</P>
<P>
 Home gyms may well be the answer for some, but only those prepared to pay some 
money. One of the better, professional-quality machines can cost anywhere from 
$1,600 to $3,200. Buyers of a simple stationary bike can get away with spending 
less than $300, however, and some well-made treadmills sell for as little as 
$450 to $500. 
</P>
<P>
 While equipment manufacturers -- and celebrity Jane Fonda, who is hawking a 
portable treadmill via infomercial -- turn their eyes toward the in-home 
exercise market, there is a naysayer among the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Lauer, president of the influential research firm American Sports Data 
Inc., said that the upswing of the past five years is beginning to level off. 
"Home fitness has hit a bit of a plateau," said Lauer, whose company is based 
in Westchester, N.Y. "Some items are up; some are down." 
</P>
<P>
 Lauer sees treadmills and recumbent bicycles, on which riders do not sit 
erect, as the hot, new in-home equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Unisen is with him on that prediction. The company leased a second warehouse 
this year to produce its treadmill and stair-stepper for home use. Opened in 
1978 with three employees, Unisen now employs about 150 people and reports 
annual revenue of $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has made a name for itself among commercial customers. It ships to 
55 countries and has sold four treadmills for use in one of the world's most 
posh hotels, the Regent in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was redesigning its commercial machine for home use, Unisen altered 
the look and electronic capabilities. A focus group set the company straight, 
though, and the machines were eventually made to resemble the commercial 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave them the rhino gun, and they took it and shot us," said Jim 
McPartland, executive vice president. "They wanted the machines they saw in the 
(health) clubs. They got conditioned to those." 
</P>
<P>
 Tectrix is counting on its retail version of ClimbMax to find its way into 
homes. The company began selling a scaled-down version, for $2,095, in October, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Russell, director of marketing for Tectrix, said that stair-step 
machines appeal to the younger end of the baby-boom generation -- people in 
their 30s and 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works the heart harder and faster than a treadmill or exercise bike," 
which minimizes workout time, Russell said. Also, "it takes up considerably 
less space in the home." 
</P>
<P>
 Tectrix, which recently tripled its warehouse space in Irvine, employs 45 
people and reports annual revenue of about $20 million. Two of the founders, 
Michael and James Sweeney, are the sons of a Unisen founder, Jim Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies have never competed head to head, said Russell, but with the 
introduction of Unisen's home stair-stepper, he said, "I guess now we will." 
Peddling Fitness at Home Treadmills, stationary bikes and stair-climbers built

BUYOUT BY PACIFIC INVESTMENT WINS ANALYSTS' PRAISES; ACQUISITION: WITH CONTROL 
OF THOMSON ADVISORY GROUP, FIRM CAN ENTER MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investment analysts on Thursday praised the proposed buyout of a New England 
money manager by Pacific Investment Management Co. as a shrewd maneuver that 
will thrust the Newport Beach firm into the lucrative mutual fund industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very smart diversification move for those guys," Walter W. Cruttenden 
III, head of Irvine brokerage Cruttenden & Co., said of Pacific Investment's 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Investment, known as PIMCO, is a subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Life 
Insurance, California's largest life and health insurance company based on 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly wouldn't bet against them," Cruttenden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Mutual announced Wednesday that it signed an agreement to merge PIMCO 
and four of its divisions with Thomson Advisory Group of Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, expected to be completed by summer, will create a powerhouse in the 
bond and mutual fund markets, managing assets worth about $70 billion, experts 
said. The transaction requires the approval of Thomson shareholders as well as 
state and federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 The new firm, to be called PIMCO Advisors L.P., will be a publicly traded 
company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 PIMCO Chief Executive William Thompson said that the money management firm, 
which has long specialized in selling bonds to institutional holders, had been 
considering ways -- including acquisitions and having its own public stock 
offering -- to get an inroad into the equity market. "We had discussed many 
ideas," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the company chose Thomson after months of discussions with 
officials of its parent, Pacific Mutual, and other prospective buyout 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 PIMCO decided on Thomson in part because it is already a publicly traded 
company and would save PIMCO the expensive procedure of an initial stock 
offering. But more important, Thompson said, Thomson is well-known for selling 
mutual funds to small investors, an untapped market for PIMCO. 
</P>
<P>
 The New England firm also has expertise in selling and managing 401-k 
retirement plans, a market that investment analysts consider lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is a fair deal, analysts said. Pacific Mutual will pay $140 
million to venture-capital groups for a controlling stake in Thomson. The new 
company will then issue 24.7 million shares -- 12.35 million in Class A stock 
and 12.35 million in Class B stock. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the 10 top managers of PIMCO would each control blocs of stock 
worth millions of dollars -- PIMCO officials would not say Thursday exactly how 
much those personal stakes would be worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson pointed out that insiders who hold Class B shares would not be able 
to trade them until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Other holders of Thomson stock will receive Class A shares in exchange for the 
Thomson shares they now own. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Thomson's stock rose $1 
a share to close at $39.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Corp. in Summit, N.J., 
said he expects the new company performance to ensure positive earnings for all 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you are marrying a good bond manager with a good equity manager," 
Lipper said. "And now they can start to put together a good, solid program." 
</P>
<P>
 PIMCO, founded in 1971, has a long record of positive performance. Through its 
institutional customer base, it has grown to manage $54.3 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 PIMCO's Total Return Fund, for instance, has had a 12.5% net return in 1993, 
13.9% for the past three years and 12.8% for the past five years. That compares 
to the Lehman Brothers' Aggregate Bond Index of 9.8% for the last year, 11% for 
the past three years and 11.3% for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lipper said he also expects good results from PIMCO's entry into the equity 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, he said, PIMCO's transformation into a public company will 
inspire its employees. "They will now start to get a stock market valuation on 
their work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some analysts have said recently that the long-running bull market may 
be almost over, William Gross, a PIMCO founder and managing director, said the 
company's decision to enter the equity market is neither ill-fated nor 
ill-timed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the long-range goals of the new firm, he said, is to offer a diverse 
product line for customers, whether they are large institutional stockholders 
or small, private investors who are looking for a safe nest for their funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we have been looking to for some time," Gross said. "Bull 
markets come to an end all the time. And they come back. It would be 
shortsighted to make a business decision based on short-term changes in either 
the equity or the bond market."

BRIEFCASE: TRAVEL AND TOURISM; AIRPORT NOT SURE WHERE IT WILL PUT SOUTHWEST 
AIRLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that Southwest Airlines plans to operate 17 flights, including the two it 
picks up from Morris Air Service, at John Wayne Airport, where will you find 
its counter? 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials aren't sure yet.Spokeswoman Courtney Wiercioch said she 
thinks the Southwest counter will probably be in the south end of the terminal. 
That would be a change for Morris Air passengers, who are used to checking in 
for their flights at a counter in the north end that Morris subleases from 
American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 American will probably be glad to see Morris go. Southwest's expected low 
fares may so badly undercut American on its eight daily flights to San Jose 
that American may pull off the route. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest says it expects to begin service May 26.

INVITRO CORROSIVES TEST GETS OSHA OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 InVitro International said the federal Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration will accept its proprietary product Corrositex as an alternative 
to animal testing to determine how corrosive various chemical and waste 
products are to human skin. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulatory acceptance follows approval of Corrositex by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation in April, 1993, and the Canadian transportation 
agency in January, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the U.S. Department of Transportation have estimated that the 
market for corrosives test products is worth up to $500 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for InVitro said Corrositex enables manufacturers, shippers and 
users of corrosive products to test the materials without resorting to the use 
of live rabbits, as has been the practice in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 OSHA requires manufacturers and users of hazardous materials, including 
corrosives, to provide appropriate warnings for the use of these materials in 
the workplace. The Department of Transportation requires shippers to determine 
corrosiveness in order to appropriately label materials for shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Corrositex gained acceptance, both the U.S. and Canadian transportation 
agencies determined corrosiveness by measuring the time it took a product to 
burn through the shaved skin of albino rabbits.

LIFE FITNESS TO MOVE IRVINE TEAM TO ILLINOIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Life Fitness is moving its 70-person sales and marketing department from 
Irvine to its headquarters outside Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 A company spokesman confirmed Thursday that the Irvine office will be scaled 
down to a district branch of about eight people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving into the consumer market aggressively, and we felt the marketing 
folks and the engineers should be able to sit next to each other during that 
process," said Michael Blyth, executive vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which makes the original programmable stationary bicycle, the 
Lifecycle, had moved its manufacturing plant from Irvine to Franklin Park, 
Ill., when it was owned by Bally Manufacturing Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1991, a management team purchased the company back from Bally for 
$62.5 million and renamed it Life Fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 Blyth said the Irvine employees were all offered jobs in Franklin Park. He 
said the company will consolidate the 60-plus jobs in its main facility and 
hire additional people. ANNE MICHAUD

HARD TIMES IN RETAIL WEIGH ON CLOTHESTIMES' EARNINGS; APPAREL: SALES WERE UP 
BUT PROFITS DROPPED FOR THE ANAHEIM-BASED DISCOUNTER. GRUNGE LOOK LACKED 
APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The weak California economy, fierce competition from department stores and the 
whims of popular fashion conspired against discount retailer Clothestime Inc. 
last year, pushing its revenues up for 1993 but causing lower profits. 
</P>
<P>
 During the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, Clothestime's sales totaled $347.6 
million, up 10% from $315.2 million in 1992. However, same-store sales -- for 
stores that have existed at least 15 months -- dropped 2%. And net income for 
the year was $8.2 million, or 56 cents per share, compared to $8.7 million, or 
58 cents per share, in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales for the fourth quarter increased 6% to $95.1 million, compared to $90 
million during the same period last year. Same-store sales for the quarter fell 
5% from a year ago. Quarterly earnings were $2.1 million, or 14 cents per 
share, compared to $2.2 million, or 15 cents per share, in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were faced with an unusually competitive retail environment -- everybody 
is cutting prices," said Clothestime spokeswoman Jane Whaley. "Also, a lot of 
the fashions (sold at Clothestime stores) lacked universal appeal. The women 
who shop at our stores did not respond well to the grunge look." 
</P>
<P>
 Clothestime, based in Anaheim, specializes in moderately priced clothing for 
young women. More than half of its 539 outlets are in California, which has yet 
to emerge from the recession. The retailer opened 82 new stores in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Millstein, editor and publisher of Fashion Network Report, a retail 
industry newsletter based in New York City, noted that all discount chains were 
hurt last year by both the "grunge look" and aggressive slashing of prices by 
department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clothestime, Ross Stores and Mervyn's (Department Stores) all had a difficult 
year," Millstein said. "It was hand-to-hand combat with department stores such 
as May Co. and Bullock's -- everyone was clubbing each other to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Discount stores lose customers when big-name department stores match prices, 
Millstein said. "Particularly in women's apparel, department stores still have 
a cache." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's fashions didn't help matters. "Young career women, aged 20 to 35, 
were turned off by the grunge look," Millstein said. "They also were turned off 
by the exotic fabrics -- velveteens more suitable for a boudoir than for the 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Millstein said that this year's "more sensible" fashions are bringing 
customers back to the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Johnson, an analyst with the brokerage Johnson Redbook Service in New 
York, said that he, too, expects a better year for Clothestime in 1994. "We're 
looking for 65 cents per share for the year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothestime stock closed at $8 Thursday, unchanged in Nasdaq trading. 
Clothestime Earnings Take a Dip 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a 10% increase in revenues, Clothestime Inc. reported a profit decline 
for fiscal year 1993, ending Jan. 29. The $8.2 million in net income was down 
about 6% from the previous year. Per-share earnings also were down from the 
year before. (Figures in millions of dollars, except per-share data.)

 Going First Class: Travelers with a taste for exclusivity might be interested 
in an auction to be held during a Laguna Art Museum fund-raising luncheon 
Monday at Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest bidder will be able to take a three-day trip to Washington for two 
that would be the envy of most diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip is tailored to appeal to the tastes of viewers of "Washington Week in 
Review," the roundtable discussion of capital journalists seen weekly on PBS. 
The show's panelists are going to speak and answer questions at the luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip includes a private tour of the White House, lunch at the Washington 
Press Club and possibly a chance to see a taping of "Washington Week in 
Review." Associated Travel in Santa Ana has donated two round-trip airline 
tickets to Washington and Hyatt Hotels is pitching in for a two-night stay at 
one of its Washington addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a trip that money can't buy," said Associated Travel President Thomas 
Nulty. Well, usually can't buy. This time, Nulty said he thinks opening bids 
could start around $2,000 -- with all proceeds to benefit the Laguna Art 
Museum.

FRUSTRATION, RELIEF MARK END OF O.C. PROBE

 There were sighs of relief, expressions of frustration and a call for healing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury's decision not to indict sheriff's deputy Brian 
P. Scanlan for the fatal shooting of a fellow officer brought a mixed reaction 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan and his family could not be reached for comment, and his attorney 
declined to say anything. But black community leaders who had sought more 
information about the fatal shooting of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Darryn 
Leroy Robins expressed dissatisfaction with the decision reached by the grand 
jury behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 25 shooting death rallied black community activists who had said the 
lack of information about the shooting of Robins, who was black, by a white 
colleague, was suspicious in its own right. Now they fear their questions will 
remain unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not satisfied, and I believe that many in the community will feel the 
same way," said Eugene Wheeler, a health-care administrator who heads a 
business and civic group called 100 Black Men of Orange County. "We've got no 
official explanation as to what evidence (the grand jury) considered, so it's 
hard for us to know.  
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that it was not a just decision. They have not released any real 
information about what happened, and they may never do that. It's not 
satisfactory because it's short in coming and it's slow in coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates said he would not second-guess the grand jury. "We've all 
been waiting for this decision to occur," Gates said, "so we can try to heal 
the wounds that have occurred because of this tragedy. It's time for that now." 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of rank-and-file deputies said the grand jury decision puts a 
painful issue to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relieved, as I'm sure the vast majority of the Sheriff's Department will 
be," said Robert MacLeod, general manager for the Orange County Deputy 
Sheriff's Assn. "This was a great tragedy, not only for the Robins family, but 
for every member of this department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thought that this portion of the case is concluded and some emotional 
healing can begin, is very comforting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One 19-year veteran sheriff's deputy, who agreed to speak on condition of 
anonymity, said the department has been grieving both for the loss of Robins 
and the emotional devastation Scanlan has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryn Robins is dead, and that is horrible, but Brian Scanlan's life will 
never be the same again," he said. "Two lives have been ruined. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was something that never should have happened, but by no means was this 
something that was planned, or something that was done as a result of somebody 
being black, or somebody being Asian, or somebody being anything. This was a 
training situation that went bad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so distasteful when people try to make this into something that it's not 
so they can get attention, so they can have a forum to speak about other 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Police Chief Stanley L. Knee said he was glad to see the case 
finally resolved. He said that a "lack of information" on the case had fueled 
concerns among the public, and the decision may help resolve some of those 
worries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time there is a police officer involved in a shooting, it's a tragic 
situation, so I think there'll be many people who'll be relieved that it's 
finally over," Knee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knee said he couldn't comment on the grand jury decision itself, because there 
aren't "more than a handful" of people who know enough about what happened at 
the parking lot that day. But, he said, "I trust the system, and I feel the 
grand jury, from its past history, has looked at this case fairly and reached a 
decision based on what was in their heart and what the law allows." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler and others critical of the way the investigation was handled were 
careful not to pin their anger on members of the grand jury. But, they said, 
the grand jury's racial makeup -- predominantly white -- and the fact that it 
takes instructions from the district attorney's office, may have clouded its 
ability to properly examine the facts in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person who advises the grand jury is a (prosecutor) from the D.A.'s 
office," Wheeler said. "He has a great influence on that jury, so is that 
independent? 
</P>
<P>
 "The D.A.'s office is the one that investigated the case. They didn't need the 
grand jury to investigate the case," Wheeler said. "If they wanted an 
indictment, why didn't they (charge) him?" 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the grand jury's decision, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi noted 
that his office had recommended that Scanlan be indicted for involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to see if 19 citizens (on the grand jury) would agree with our 
evaluation," he said in a statement. "The grand jury did not, and we respect 
their collective wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi was unavailable for further comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler said he met with members of the grand jury's criminal committee about 
a month ago and came away feeling that some of them thought his concerns about 
possible racial undertones in the shooting -- and what he felt was a cover-up 
of the facts surrounding the case -- were "paranoid." 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not come out of that meeting feeling comfortable that we would get 
anything out of it, but I dismissed those feelings as my own personal bias," 
Wheeler said. "But today it hit me in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Colquitt, president of the Orange County chapter of the NAACP, said, "The 
NAACP's position was, 'Somebody did something wrong.' We don't know whether it 
was policy, but somebody doing something wrong caused the incident, and when I 
say incident, I mean it wasn't an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it was handled made it look like there was something wrong, whether 
there was or not. We can only hope that the grand jury got everything that they 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Several black community leaders said they hoped the grand jury would take a 
broader look at whether institutionalized problems with the Sheriff's 
Department's training procedures contributed to the shooting, and whether 
broader problems exist within the district attorney's office and Sheriff's 
Department that inhibited the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Jordan, the publisher the Black Orange, a publication for Orange 
County's African American community, who had called for an independent 
investigation into the shooting, said he plans to canvass the community in the 
coming days and decide whether to take further action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume that the grand jury followed the letter of the law, and that with 
what they were presented they came up with a legally binding decision that 
Brian Scanlan was not criminally or grossly negligent," Jordan said. "But I 
don't understand their conclusion. I am disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 According to political consultants, the grand jury's decision should create 
little if any political fallout for the reelection campaigns of Sheriff-Coroner 
Brad Gates or Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tragedy, and everyone feels bad about it, but I don't think 
everyone believes that (the shooting) was done purposely," said political 
consultant Harvey Englander. "Certainly, there was a violation of procedures, 
and the deputy who did it will probably be punished severely, if not taken off 
the force." 
</P>
<P>
 Another political consultant, Mark Q. Thompson, said that most voters will ask 
themselves if any justice would have been served by an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the typical drug creep or rapist who maliciously did something," 
Thompson said. "I don't think anyone is going to be outraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Colquitt, of the NAACP, said he has an envelope full of letters and telephone 
messages from people who contend there was more to the case than publicly 
revealed. He said he is convinced that neither Gates nor Capizzi pushed the 
investigation to its fullest extent. 
</P>
<P>
 But Colquitt said he is equally convinced that it will not matter to Orange 
County voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they went against the old (political) custom in Orange County. 
. . . I don't think there will be any backlash," Colquitt said. "(Scanlan) has 
committed a gross error by taking another person's life. It cannot be 
innocence." NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury's decision not to indict Sheriff's Deputy Brian P. Scanlan in 
the Dec. 25 shooting death of fellow Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins closed one key 
chapter in the case, but several steps still remain: 
</P>
<P>
 * Scanlan's job status: Scanlan remains on paid administrative leave pending 
the outcome of a Sheriff's Department inquiry into the case to determine what 
if any disciplinary action should be taken against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials have already acknowledged that Scanlan appeared to have 
violated department policy by using a loaded weapon during a training exercise, 
and they say they have begun "reinforcing" existing regulations in the minds of 
their officers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Litigation: Members of Robins' family said in December, just days after the 
shooting, that they did not intend to pursue a lawsuit against the Sheriff's 
Department or anyone else over the shooting. But family members have refused to 
discuss the case in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * State or federal investigations: A coalition of minority leaders in Orange 
County, unsatisfied by the handing of the investigation by local authorities, 
have called repeatedly for a separate and independent investigation into the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts have been rebuffed to date, but officials at both the state 
attorney general's office and the U.S. Justice Department have held out the 
possibility that they might review the case once local authorities had 
completed their work.

JURY REFUSES TO INDICT DEPUTY IN FELLOW O.C. OFFICER'S KILLING; JUSTICE: PANEL 
OVERRIDES RECOMMENDATION OF PROSECUTORS, WHO SOUGHT CHARGE OF INVOLUNTARY 
MANSLAUGHTER ON GROUNDS OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE. DECISION RAISES OUTCRY FROM 
MINORITY GROUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury, rejecting the recommendation of local 
prosecutors, decided Thursday not to indict Sheriff's Deputy Brian P. Scanlan 
in the Christmas Day shooting death of a fellow deputy during an impromptu 
training exercise gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision sparked an immediate outcry from minority groups that have lashed 
out at authorities for their handling of the case, which involves the death of 
a black deputy at the hands of a white fellow officer. But the head of the 
Orange County Deputy Sheriffs Assn. said he believed most officers will be 
"relieved" by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had recommended that Scanlan be indicted on involuntary 
manslaughter charges, because they saw his conduct as "not simply negligent, 
but . . . aggravated, reckless and grossly negligent," according to a statement 
by Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
 But Capizzi said prosecutors respected the "collective wisdom" of the grand 
jury in reaching its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel confident," said Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley, "that we can look 
anyone in the eye and know we presented this case fairly, and the grand jury 
simply decided not to indict." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury made its decision after four days of closed hearings that began 
last week and included sworn testimony from 14 witnesses and the examination of 
25 pieces of evidence that were offered by the district attorney's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan, 32, a former Army private and a sheriff's training officer who 
remains on paid leave from the department pending an internal investigation, 
declined to testify before the grand jury. But the panel did view a 90-minute, 
videotaped interview with Scanlan that was made by investigators on the day 
that he fatally shot Darryn Leroy Robins, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 With only rare exceptions, grand juries generally follow the recommendations 
of prosecutors who bring potential criminal cases before them. But Conley said 
the Scanlan case was "a close call" that could have gone either way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue in this case is a close one. Everyone agrees that Brian Scanlan 
didn't handle this right by going up to the officer with a loaded weapon and 
the safety off," Conley said. "What the grand jury apparently decided was that 
it may have been bad, but it wasn't that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting has had an emotional and far-reaching impact in the county, 
creating disbelief among cops in the street, prompting a review of safety 
procedures in the Sheriff's Department and giving voice to a black political 
movement that had remained largely dormant in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not satisfied and I believe that many in the community will feel the 
same way," said Eugene Wheeler, a health care administrator who heads a 
business and civic group called 100 Black Men of Orange County. "We got no 
official explanation as to what evidence (the grand jury) considered, so it's 
hard for us to know." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, for all its volatility, the case came down to a technical reading 
of whether Scanlan's fatal shooting of Robins constituted the "aggravated, 
reckless and grossly negligent" act that prosecutors saw, Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury decided it did not, but just how the panel interpreted the 
legal principles in the case may never be known. Seven members refused to talk 
about the case, most saying they had been instructed not to discuss the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The only word from the jury was a one-sentence release, signed by foreman 
Frank V. Kroeger, that read: 'The Orange County Grand Jury, in the Brian 
Patrick Scanlan hearing, has determined not to return an indictment on this 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said that the grand jury proceedings in the case will not be 
released publicly, but that the district attorney's office is considering the 
release of portions of its own files in the case -- in part to help assuage 
lingering suspicions about what happened on Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see (the evidence in) this case, you see it's not a racial case, 
it's not an intentional case and all the other stuff that people have been 
nervous about," Conley said.  
</P>
<P>
 Robins was killed in a parking lot behind the Twin-Peaks Plaza movie theater 
in Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 While many details of the shooting have slowly and gradually emerged in press 
accounts, authorities offered the official version of the mishap for the first 
time Thursday following the grand jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said that Scanlan had been bothered by techniques used by California 
Highway Patrol officers in a felony car stop in which he had assisted earlier 
in the day. He and Robins then decided to run through some training techniques 
to aid a trainee riding with Scanlan, and they picked the parking lot as their 
locale after responding to a call for assistance at a nearby restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The trainee and another deputy waited around a corner while Scanlan and Robins 
prepared to run through the exercise. Robins played the part of a suspect in a 
car stop, while Scanlan approached the car, drew his loaded, 9-millimeter 
pistol and rested it on the roof of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble developed, Conley said, when Robins, supposedly reaching for his 
registration papers behind his car's sun visor, instead produced a .25-caliber 
handgun -- a maneuver used by Los Angeles gang members. He whipped the gun from 
its hiding place and thrust it out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins was not authorized to carry a second gun on patrol, Conley said, and 
the visor maneuver had not been discussed before the exercise. "Reflexively, 
(Scanlan fired. It was a startled reaction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet hit Robins, who was just inches away from the gun's muzzle, grazing 
his nose and descending through his mouth and lip before finally severing an 
artery in his neck, Conley said.  
</P>
<P>
 As Robins then staggered out the passenger door, Scanlan asked him if he was 
all right, Conley said. The victim's only response was: "Hospital." Scanlan 
himself rushed the victim to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, where he 
was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials did not release the grand jury's vote. Twelve of its 19 members 
would have had to vote for an indictment in order for Scanlan to face charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to see if 19 citizens would agree with our evaluation," Capizzi 
said in his statement. "The grand jury did not, and we respect their collective 
wisdom. . . . Our hearts go out to the families of both these deputy sheriffs. 
This is a tragic shooting that no one involved will ever forget."  
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi referred all further questions on the case to Conley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the grand jury is a patsy," said Jerry A. Matney, 61, of 
Huntington Beach, who was picked to be a member of this grand jury but had to 
surrender his slot because of a back injury. "They pretty much will make their 
own decisions. They're strong individuals. They have their own opinions. 
They're intelligent. They're not easily misled or misguided. I don't think they 
would be led by the nose by the D.A. If there isn't a case there, they won't 
make one." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most controversial police-shooting case faced by the grand jury in 
a decade, and the last one of its magnitude ended with a similar result.  
</P>
<P>
 That came in 1983, when a Stanton police officer shot and killed a 5-year-old 
boy in the boy's apartment after the officer saw a shadowy figure in the 
darkness and mistook him for an armed assailant. The boy was holding a toy gun. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the Robins shooting, prosecutors decided to bring the case before the 
grand jury to decide -- a move that helped insulate the district attorney's 
office from the ultimate decision. And as in the Robins shooting, the grand 
jury decided not to indict the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said that prosecutors could still decide to bring charges on their own 
in the Scanlan case if they "violently disagreed" with the grand jury's 
decision, but that will not happen here. "This is the end of the case," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Scanlan and his attorney, James Stotler of Santa Ana, have refused to 
talk about the case in the past, and neither could be reached for comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan was placed on leave at the Sheriff's Department immediately after the 
shooting, and Sheriff Brad Gates said in an interview that the department will 
now conduct its own internal review to determine what disciplinary action if 
any should be taken against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the department allows Scanlan to return to work, Robert MacLeod, 
general manager of the deputies association, said that in the wake of the 
shooting's emotional trauma, the key question now being asked by many of 
Scanlan's colleagues is: "Is Brian able and does he wish to return to the 
department?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said that department officials have already completed a preliminary 
review of safety procedures as a result of the Robins shooting. That review 
found that current department policy "adequately" addresses issues of officer 
safety, but it did recommend a "reinforcement" of existing regulations for 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we will do and are already doing now is to reinforce (safety procedures) 
during training and briefing sessions. There will be a constant reminder, and 
we will make sure that gets done," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 * EARLIER CONTROVERSY: Grand jury was called insensitive to ethnic concerns. 
A23 How Shooting Occurred 
</P>
<P>
 The Christmas Day shooting of an Orange County sheriff's deputy happened 
during an impromptu training session in a parking lot: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Sheriff's Deputy Brian P. Scanlan approaches Deputy Darryn Robins' vehicle; 
Scanlan takes his loaded 9-millimeter automatic pistol out of its holster, 
brings it to roof of vehicle and out of Robins' view. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Robins hands Scanlan a mock driver's license. Then, he reaches up to visor 
as if to retrieve his registration, but instead produces an unloaded 
.25-caliber automatic pistol and thrusts it at Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Scanlan is startled, steps back and fires. Bullet hits Robins in the face, 
severing his carotid artery and killing him.

REMEMBER THE DROUGHT? WELL, IT MIGHT BE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when you thought it was safe to linger in the shower for a few extra 
minutes, state water officials say California is slipping into another drought. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this winter, rain and snow amounts in the critical mountain regions of 
Northern California -- where most of the state's water originates -- are well 
below normal and even lower than in some of the recent drought years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water supply outlook for the coming runoff year is not encouraging," said 
Gerald Gewe, director of resources planning at the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power. "With only four weeks remaining in the snow season, time is 
quickly running out for any significant recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 The light precipitation is already having an impact. Last week the Department 
of Water and Power announced it would increase rates by 9% beginning in April, 
to pay for additional water that will have to be purchased from other agencies. 
And agricultural areas, particularly in the Central Valley, could be facing 
severe shortages, said Steve Hall, executive director of the Assn. of 
California Water Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the state is not in the same dangerous condition as it was in 1991 and 
1992, the end of the last drought, officials said. At this point, no major 
water agencies in Southern California are proposing restrictions on usage, 
though supplies will be short. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, conditions in the Eastern Sierra qualify as "critically dry," 
under criteria established by the California Department of Water Resources. In 
the Western Sierra, conditions are on the borderline between dry and critically 
dry. The state suffered dry and critically dry conditions in all six years of 
the recent drought. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this winter, precipitation in the State Water Project's giant watershed 
on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada is at about 70% of normal. In the 
watershed on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, where the City of Los 
Angeles gets most of its water, snowpack is 59% of normal. And in the Los 
Angeles Basin, where some communities collect important ground water supplies, 
precipitation is just 53% of normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not much different than when we were in the drought," said Maury Roos, 
chief hydrologist for the state. And there is little hope that things will 
change much in the next few weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The devastating six-year drought ended last year when a statewide deluge 
filled parched reservoirs and erased water use from our top 10 list of 
concerns. But the window of opportunity for such relief this year is rapidly 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the state's water supply arrives in the rains and snows of December, 
January and February. March and November are the next best months for 
precipitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some years when April makes a difference, but not many," said Roos. 
If the rain hasn't arrived by April 1, chances are that it won't, Roos added. 
</P>
<P>
 One bright spot is the Colorado River, where the water supply is expected to 
be at normal levels this year, according to figures provided by the 
Metropolitan Water District. The MWD, which imports and distributes about half 
the water consumed in Southern California, gets about half its supply from the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservoir storage statewide is close to normal levels for this point in the 
year because of the large amount of water left over from last year's unusually 
heavy rains. But the storage level will soon begin dropping below normal levels 
as the runoff from the winter's sparse snowpack fails to replenish the 
reservoirs as quickly as the water is drawn for use. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be living off the carry-over storage," Roos said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's reservoir storage may not go as far as it would have in years 
past. Water agencies are now required to devote a greater share of the 
available water to environmental uses, such as releasing water into the 
Sacramento Delta to aid fisheries. That will cut down on the amount of 
reservoir storage that will be available for Southern California consumers, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I worried? Sure," said Duane Georgeson, assistant general manger of the 
Metropolitan Water District, which serves a six-county region from San Diego to 
Ventura. "We've got enough storage for one dry year. But with two, you're in 
the soup." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's water agencies were criticized in the last drought for allegedly 
mismanaging reservoir storage. Some authorities said agencies released too much 
water from storage too early, leaving the state severely short of supplies when 
the drought persisted longer than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, officials at the key Southern California water districts are not yet 
suggesting there will be cutbacks at the tap this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is, as long as people stick to their good habits," said the DWP's Gewe. 
</P>
<P>
 Gewe said that even though the drought officially ended last spring, 
consumers' conservation habits did not. Gewe said that water consumption is 
still down about 20% from pre-drought levels -- about the same level of 
conservation noted during the drought. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drought lasted long enough that the habits became permanent," Gewe said. 
And the habits are assisted by hardware, as tens of thousands of low-flush 
toilets and low-flow shower heads were installed by Californians during the 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgeson said that demand among the MWD's customers is down by about 10% to 
12% from 1991 levels, despite increased population. He attributed the 
difference to ongoing, habitual conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news for California, because water officials are increasingly 
worried about the weather trends and the possibility that the state is in a dry 
period that could last for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1993 being the only wet year in the past eight, experts are concerned 
about the long-term trend. "Was last year the end of the drought, or just an 
anomaly in an ongoing drought?" Gewe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists have speculated that the weather patterns of the last 100 
years or so have been much wetter than the region is historically used to. The 
recent drought, some say, could signal a return to a drier weather pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does make one wonder if 1993 is just a fluke and we are living in an 
extended dry pattern," Roos said. The Dry Look

on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada is less than normal, and well below 
last year's mark.

LAST-SECOND DEAL ENDS CANYON OAKS DISPUTE; PARKLAND: THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS 
CONSERVANCY ANNOUNCES IT WILL BUY THE SITE. TOPANGA RESIDENTS CHEER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The longest land-use dispute in Los Angeles County history came to a startling 
conclusion Thursday as the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy announced that it 
would buy the proposed site of a controversial development in Topanga Canyon -- 
just minutes before the Board of Supervisors was to vote on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Topanga residents packing the board's cavernous Downtown chambers 
jumped to their feet and applauded as Supervisor Ed Edelman unveiled the 
eleventh-hour deal, which was hammered out in grueling overnight negotiations 
and is as historic as the tortuous tale of the project itself. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board approves the deal later this month, the $19.9 million the 
conservancy offered for 662 acres in the canyon's Summit Valley area would be 
the highest price paid by the state agency since its 1979 creation. The 
conservancy intends to preserve the land in its natural state for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 The move scotches plans to develop Canyon Oaks Estates -- a proposed private 
links-style golf course and 97 luxury home sites on 257 acres -- and ends a 
nasty fight pitting neighbor against neighbor that began 16 years ago when a 
different developer proposed a similar, but much larger, project. 
</P>
<P>
 Years of vehement community protest appeared to have taken their toll in what 
detractors considered a rare victory against a well-financed opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Wilson, president of the Canyon Oaks Estates partnership, said the 
corporation was tired of fighting a battle that he said in recent months had 
degenerated into smear tactics and personal attacks. In fact, he said, the 
corporation, part of a Disney family trust, will lose money -- money he said 
cannot be recouped through tax write-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to reach a resolution," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Oaks had rejected previous purchase offers from the conservancy, which 
has acquired more than 20,000 acres in the Santa Monica Mountains for use as 
public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very positive first step," said Wilson, who helps manage the trust 
established by the late Sharon Disney Lund, daughter of the late Walt Disney. 
Canyon Oaks is part of the trust, which is unrelated to other Walt Disney Co. 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Thursday's announcement, plans to develop Canyon Oaks Estates will 
remain before the county. If supervisors and the conservancy fail to finalize 
the deal before April 5, Wilson said the corporation will press forward with 
its proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joseph T. Edmiston, conservancy executive director, said he does not 
expect any difficulty in realizing the agreements reached during a 19-hour 
negotiating session that ended at dawn Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money for the purchase -- about $14.1 million -- will come from 
Proposition A funds already earmarked for land acquisition in the Santa Monica 
Mountains. That transaction will put 432 acres into public hands. The remaining 
230 acres will cost about $5.8 million, due in August, 1995. Those funds are 
expected to come from Proposition 180, a statewide parks initiative on the June 
7 ballot, or through fund-raising efforts, Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors, who have final say over disbursement of Proposition A funds, are 
scheduled to vote March 29 on releasing the initial $14.1 million to the 
conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes of the deal's announcement, Topanga residents who earlier had 
been noisily picketing the project outside the county building were shaking 
hands with Canyon Oaks lawyers and managers, promising to work together to make 
sure the agreement holds. 
</P>
<P>
 To all but the tiny group of negotiators, news of the deal was a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was like totally shocked," said Roger Pugliese, vice chairman of the 
Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community and one of the project's most vociferous 
critics. "But it could not have gone better." 
</P>
<P>
 It first became apparent that something was in the works about 9:45 a.m. 
Thursday when a Canyon Oaks attorney asked for a 30-minute delay in the 
supervisors' hearing. Edelman, credited with brokering the deal, granted the 
attorney's request and hinted that something historic was about to take place. 
</P>
<P>
 That delay was key, providing enough time for an arm of the conservancy -- the 
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority -- to meet in Calabasas and 
take an emergency vote to purchase the property. As soon as news of that 4-0 
vote was telephoned Downtown, supervisors resumed their meeting and announced 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Topanga residents burst into applause and cheers, prompting 
Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke to bang her gavel and shout: "Forgive me, 
but this is not a football game." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a far happier ending for opponents than that anticipated just 24 hours 
earlier, when both sides believed that the project would ultimately end up 
before a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in the last-minute negotiations said the impasse only began to 
lift Tuesday night when Edelman visited the property about three miles south of 
the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed to me that we had to make a last-ditch effort to see if there 
was a will to resolve this thing," said Edelman, who called Edmiston from his 
car phone while driving back along Pacific Coast Highway to arrange the meeting 
with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 a.m. Wednesday, both sides sat down for the first time in months in 
Edelman's eighth-floor office. Later that evening, talks moved to the 
49th-floor conference room of a Downtown law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only took potty breaks," said Edmiston, adding he did not leave until 
about 6:30 the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the conservancy had made previous offers to buy the property, Canyon 
Oaks executives had rejected them. Wilson said the past proposals were turned 
down because the conservancy did not have access to the money necessary to 
support its offers, which were only for the 257 acres proposed for immediate 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 But the availability of Proposition A funds in the fall made it possible to 
bid for the entire property, which straddles Topanga Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama with which the Canyon Oaks story ended was appropriate, considering 
that its history includes dozens of public hearings, a flurry of lawsuits, and 
uncounted accusations of sleaze and malfeasance. 
</P>
<P>
 Permits for the project were first requested in 1978. Two years later, it was 
unveiled as the Montevideo Country Club, with 257 homes, a commercial center, 
golf course, country club and hotel. The mastermind of the deal was the 
ruddy-faced son of a Polish cavalry officer, Christopher Wojciechowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-charging and blunt, Wojciechowski won few friends in bucolic Topanga 
Canyon as he lobbied to get permits for his projects. A decade after it was 
proposed, the project was significantly scaled back by county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1989, the debt-saddled Montevideo Partnership was forced to file for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing debts of $28 million. As the 
partnership was being reorganized, supervisors in 1991 rejected the most recent 
version of the project. Two weeks later, however, the board changed its mind 
and sent the project back into the county bureaucracy for revisions and public 
hearings. The revised proposal only emerged from the Regional Planning 
Commission in December. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, however, the leadership of the partnership had changed. 
Wojciechowski was forced out and replaced by his partner, Sharon Disney Lund, a 
USC schoolmate who had lent the developer $5 million for his project. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Lund, who died last year, the project name was changed, as was its 
scope. Promoters claimed that it was more sensitive to the environment, but 
many neighbors complained that it was the same project with a new name. 
</P>
<P>
 They highlighted the connection with the Disney family and complained that the 
trust's deep pockets could keep plans alive at great cost. Opponents 
characterized a $500,000 grant offered by Canyon Oaks to improve the 
community's trails as a bribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, when Wilson promised Thursday that the $500,000 would still be donated to 
the community, no one turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
 As conflict intensified in the past year, both sides launched publicity 
campaigns that savaged each other and sought to stain the personal reputations 
of key players. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Oaks officials characterized opposition leaders as hypocrites, accusing 
them of protesting new development even as they made illegal additions to their 
homes and allowed their septic systems to overflow into Topanga Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes attacked the Walt Disney Co., portraying such characters as Mickey Mouse 
and the Seven Dwarfs as fanged money-grubbers. Earlier this week, 
schoolchildren picketed the company in Burbank, carrying signs that read "Don't 
Mickey Mouse with our mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, opposing sides shook hands, then stood next to each other with 
forced grins and appeared at least on the surface to forgive and forget. 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowd filed out of the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration, a little 
boy stood cheering on a wall. After a friend asked what he was up to, he 
shouted: "We're going to Disneyland!" Arrested Development 
</P>
<P>
 Topanga Canyon Land to be Purchased by Conservancy 
</P>
<P>
 A state parks agency, Los Angeles County officials and a developer crafted a 
last-minute plan that would turn the site of a proposed 257-acre housing and 
golf complex into public parkland. Most recently known as Canyon Oaks Estates, 
the project was at the heart of the longest land-use dispute in county history. 
Entire purchase involves 662 acres. What is Preserved 
</P>
<P>
 The 257 acres contain streamside habitat and more than 400 oak trees and 
native plants such as coastal sage scrub, chapparal and grassland, Site is also 
home to coyotes, deer, hawks and mountain lions. What is Rejected 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan had been approved, this area would have had 97 home lots, 153-acre 
golf course and a tennis club. Three artificial lakes were planned, along with 
a waste-water treatment plant. The project would have called for the grading of 
3.29 million cubic acres of earth. Developers promised to relocate 102 of the 
151 impacted oak trees on-site and restore the native plant communities on 108 
acres. How the Deal Works: 
</P>
<P>
 The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, an arm of the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy, voted Thursday to purchase land owned by Canyon 
Oaks. The process: 
</P>
<P>
 * Authority Thursday asked the Board of Supervisors to set aside $14.1 million 
in Proposition A park funds to allow purchase of 432 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 * The authority would handle purchase, but supervisors must release the funds. 
They are to vote on the request March 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Escrow deadline: April 5. If sale does not close, developer will ask 
supervisors to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining 230 acres to be purchased with funds from Proposition 180, a 
statewide ballot initiative, or other sources. Payment deadline: August, 1995.

DROUGHT MAY MAKE COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when you thought it was safe to linger in the shower for a few extra 
minutes, state water officials say California is slipping into another drought. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this winter, rain and snow amounts in the critical mountain regions of 
Northern California -- where most of the state's water originates -- are well 
below normal and even lower than in some of the recent drought years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water supply outlook for the coming runoff year is not encouraging," said 
Gerald Gewe, director of resources planning at the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power. "With only four weeks remaining in the snow season, time is 
quickly running out for any significant recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County gets its water in part from the ground, and in part by 
purchasing imported Colorado River and State Water Project supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both supplies are at risk during a drought," said Stan Sprague, general 
manager of the Municipal Water District of Orange County, which sells imported 
water in the region on behalf of the Metropolitan Water District. "There's not 
a lot of water percolating into the underground, and that basin is like a 
savings account." 
</P>
<P>
 There is enough imported water available through the Metropolitan Water 
District to replenish Orange County's ground-water supplies through June, 
Sprague said, but he added that that assessment could change if the area gets 
no more rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing in the Prado Dam. It's still empty," added James A. Van Haun, 
executive assistant to the manager of the Orange County Water District, which 
manages all Orange county ground water.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the long term it's alarming. It's always alarming because you never know 
if you're going to enter into another seven-year drought or 10-year drought or 
what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Prado Dam Basin provides about 75% of the water for 2 million Orange 
County residents, percolating into the ground and then being pumped back out to 
consumers by various cities, and the water level is about as low as it was 
during the six-year drought, Van Haun said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, the district plans to allow just as much water to be pumped out 
of the ground this year as last year, because it is purchasing water from the 
Metropolitan Water District to replenish the supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 About 22 Orange County cities rely mostly on ground water, and Fullerton is 
one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping we'd have another year like last year. But here it's March 
already, and it's looking like we're certainly not going to do it," said Larry 
Sears, water system engineer for the city of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton pumps 75% of its water from the ground, paying the Orange County 
Water District for those rights. The city purchases the other 25% from the 
Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's board of directors will consider raising the rates it charges 
cities for pumping ground water when it meets Wednesday, Van Haun said. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase being contemplated by the board could translate into a 4% to 5% 
rate hike, Sears said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Water District decided last week to raise its rates effective 
July 1, and Fullerton consumers will feel the sting of that hike too, Sears 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 South County cities that rely wholly on imported water may also see rate 
increases because of that hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power announced it would 
increase rates by 9% beginning in April, to pay for additional water that will 
have to be purchased from other agencies. And agricultural areas, particularly 
in the Central Valley, could be facing severe shortages, said Steve Hall, 
executive director of the Assn. of California Water Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the state is not in the dangerous condition of 1991 and 1992, the end 
of the last drought, officials said. At this point, no major water agencies in 
Southern California are proposing restrictions on usage, although supplies will 
be short. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, conditions in the eastern Sierra qualify as "critically dry," 
under criteria established by the California Department of Water Resources. In 
the western Sierra, conditions are on the borderline between dry and critically 
dry. The state suffered dry and critically dry conditions in all six years of 
the recent drought. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not much different than when we were in the drought," said Maury Roos, 
chief hydrologist for the state. And there is little hope that things will 
change much in the next few weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The devastating six-year drought ended last year when a statewide deluge 
filled parched reservoirs and erased water use from the top 10 list of 
concerns. But the window of opportunity for such relief this year is rapidly 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the state's water supply arrives in the rains and snows of December, 
January and February. March and November are the next best months for 
precipitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some years when April makes a difference, but not many," said Roos. 
If the rain hasn't arrived by April 1, chances are that it won't, Roos added. 
</P>
<P>
 One bright spot is the Colorado River, where the water supply is expected to 
be at normal levels this year, according to figures provided by the 
Metropolitan Water District. The MWD, which imports and distributes about half 
the water consumed in Southern California, gets about half its supply from the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservoir storage statewide is close to normal levels for this point in the 
year because of the large amount of water left over from last year's unusually 
heavy rains. But the storage level will soon begin dropping below normal levels 
as the runoff from the winter's sparse snowpack fails to replenish the 
reservoirs as quickly as the water is drawn for use. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's reservoir storage may not go as far as it would have in years 
past. Water agencies are now required to devote a greater share of the 
available water to environmental uses, such as releasing water into the 
Sacramento Delta to aid fisheries. That will cut down on the amount of 
reservoir storage that will be available for Southern California consumers, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1993 being the only wet year in the past eight, experts are concerned 
about the long-term trend. "Was last year the end of the drought, or just an 
anomaly in an ongoing drought?" said DWP's Gewe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists have speculated that the weather patterns of the last 100 
years or so have been much wetter than the region is historically used to. The 
recent drought, some say, could signal a return to a drier weather pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does make one wonder if 1993 is just a fluke and we are living in an 
extended dry pattern," Roos said.

GOLF COURSE'S NEW HOLE A HAZARD; EMERGENCY: A SINKHOLE 80 FEET LONG, 40 FEET 
WIDE AND 30 FEET DEEP THREATENS TO UNDERMINE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY AND UTILITY 
LINES IN DANA POINT. A CRUMBLED DRAINAGE CHANNEL IS BELIEVED TO BE THE CAUSE. 
</P>

<P>
 Emergency crews are scrambling to repair a huge crater in a Dana Point golf 
course and a damaged underground drainage channel that threaten to undermine 
the nearby Pacific Coast Highway and sewer and gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The hole, estimated to be 80 feet long, 40 feet wide and 30 feet deep, was 
discovered by maintenance workers near the 13th green at The Links at Monarch 
Beach golf course Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, nobody knew what created the mysterious hole, but eventually, Orange 
County public works officials found evidence that an aged drainage channel 30 
to 40 feet underground had partly crumbled, probably causing the ground above 
it to sink. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could cause catastrophic failure if the roof (of the channel) was to 
finally cave in," said Jim Miller, Orange County's chief of flood control 
design. "The main thing is we don't want additional movement or dropping to 
occur." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for problems -- the four-lane coastal highway is only 25 feet 
away -- prompted the County Board of Supervisors this week to declare a local 
emergency in the area and authorize an initial $200,000 for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, county crews had begun fixing the broken 14-foot-high drainage 
channel, although officials still do not know the extent of the damage. Workers 
are laboring in the damp darkness of intact sections of the channel, trying to 
support the vulnerable tunnel with a concrete foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really like a mining operation, working deep inside the culvert," said 
Jim Williams, an engineer for the county's Environmental Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The project could take six months and hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
finish. And, if the hole expands, it could cause a break in the highway, 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the situation continues to deteriorate, it could cause damage to PCH," he 
said. "If it was sudden, someone (on the roadway) could get hurt. But we are in 
there to prevent something like that from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Golf course spokesman Ben Cagle said the course remains open and there is no 
danger to players. The damaged area has been roped off and lies just off the 
13th green near the Ritz Cove housing development on the ocean side of Pacific 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The crater in the golf course apparently appeared overnight, Miller said. Golf 
course employees "told us when they went home on Sunday afternoon, everything 
looked OK, but when they came in on the 21st, they saw it," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 County crews later discovered that the sinkhole was only a symptom of a 
problem about 30 to 40 feet underground, Miller said. The sinkhole can easily 
be filled, but fixing the underground channel will take much longer, Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the damage is near a junction connecting an old section of the storm 
drain to a newer one, Miller said. A break at the junction has allowed water to 
seep into the ground and dirt to sink into the big channel.

GRAND JURY WON'T INDICT DEPUTY IN COLLEAGUE'S DEATH; LAW ENFORCEMENT: 
PROSECUTORS HAD SOUGHT MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES IN SHOOTING OF A BLACK OFFICER 
DURING AN EXERCISE. DECISION ANGERS MINORITY GROUPS. 
</P>

<P>
 Rejecting the recommendation of prosecutors, the Orange County Grand Jury 
decided Thursday not to indict Sheriff's Deputy Brian J. Scanlan in the 
Christmas Day shooting death of a fellow deputy during an impromptu training 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision sparked an immediate outcry from minority groups that have lashed 
out at authorities for their handling of the case, which involves the death of 
a black deputy at the hands of a white fellow officer. But the head of the 
Orange County Deputy Sheriffs Assn. said he believes most officers will be 
relieved by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had recommended that Scanlan be indicted on involuntary 
manslaughter charges, because they saw his conduct as "not simply negligent, 
but . . . aggravated, reckless and grossly negligent," according to a statement 
by Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said of the grand jury's decision: "I 
feel confident that we can look anyone in the eye and know we presented this 
case fairly, and the grand jury simply decided not to indict." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury made its decision after four days of closed hearings that began 
last week and included sworn testimony from 14 witnesses and the examination of 
25 pieces of evidence offered by the district attorney's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan, 32, a Sheriff's Department training officer who remains on leave from 
the department, declined to testify before the grand jury. But the panel did 
view a 90-minute videotaped interview with Scanlan made by investigators on the 
day that he fatally shot Darryn Leroy Robins, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 With rare exceptions, grand juries generally follow the recommendations of 
prosecutors who bring potential criminal cases before them. But Conley said the 
Scanlan case was "a close call" that could have gone either way. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the grand jury apparently decided was that it may have been bad, but it 
wasn't that bad," Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting has prompted a review of Sheriff's Department safety procedures 
and rankled minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not satisfied, and I believe that many in the community will feel the 
same way," said Eugene Wheeler, a health care administrator who heads a 
business and civic group called 100 Black Men of Orange County. "We got no 
official explanation as to what evidence (the grand jury) considered, so it's 
hard for us to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how the grand jury interpreted the legal principles in the case may never 
be known, since members contacted said they had been ordered not to discuss 
their deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins was killed in a parking lot behind a Lake Forest movie theater. 
Although many details of the shooting have slowly and gradually emerged in news 
accounts, authorities offered the official version of the incident for the 
first time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said that Scanlan had been bothered by techniques used by California 
Highway Patrol officers in a felony car stop in which he had assisted earlier 
in the day. He and Robins then decided to run through some training techniques 
to aid a trainee riding with Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 The trainee and another deputy waited around a corner while Scanlan and Robins 
prepared to run through the exercise. Robins played the part of a suspect while 
Scanlan approached the car, drew his loaded 9-millimeter pistol and rested it 
on the vehicle's roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble developed, Conley said, when Robins, supposedly reaching for his 
registration papers behind a visor, instead produced a .25-caliber automatic 
handgun and thrust it out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins was not authorized to carry a second gun on patrol, Conley said, and 
the visor maneuver had not been discussed before the exercise. "Reflexively, 
(Scanlan) fired," Conley said. "It was a startled reaction." The bullet severed 
an artery in Robins' neck.

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / JAMES BORNEMEIER: TRIUMPH OF PARTY POLITICS OVER 
IDEOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to toughness on immigration issues, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-El 
Cajon) has few peers. 
</P>
<P>
 During his 6 1/2 terms in Congress, Hunter has tirelessly fought to gain 
control over the U.S.-Mexico border, the country's superhighway for illegal 
immigration. With anti-immigrant feeling in California rising and his 
GOP-leaning 52nd District encompassing most of the state's southern boundary, 
Hunter's tough stance is a political no-brainer. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pushed for the construction of a 10-foot steel wall to replace the 
ragged chain-link fence long regarded as a mockery of border security. 
</P>
<P>
 He has sought improvements to border roads, giving U.S. agents better mobility 
to pursue the thousands of illegal immigrants who cross northward every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a host of other House Republicans, he has demanded a tightening of 
immigration procedures and begged for some enforcement muscle to back up the 
dry rhetoric of federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
 And last year, in a notable success, he shepherded an appropriation through 
Congress aimed at hiring 600 new Border Patrol agents. It was a rare concrete 
accomplishment amid the swirl of emotional proposals over the immigration 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 He quickly dubbed it the Hunter Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So why then, during debate on the California earthquake aid bill last month, 
did Hunter vote for a budget-cutting amendment that would have slashed some of 
the very Border Patrol funds he fought so hard to get? 
</P>
<P>
 Because Hunter faced a dilemma: be true to his immigration views or to 
Republican fiscal values? Party loyalty won -- and in this Congress it has been 
winning these contests as much as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like the idea that there were some Border Patrol funds (cut) in the 
bill," Hunter explained, "but I figured that what I was successful doing last 
year I could do again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter's optimism is founded on his amendment's comfortable margin of victory. 
But to Democrats who have tracked Hunter's Border Patrol votes, his shifting of 
positions is nothing more than political opportunism. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is wholly inconsistent," said Rep. Neal Smith (D-Iowa), the 
Appropriations Committee "cardinal" who controls Border Patrol funding. "One 
year he votes to cut $78 million (from the Border Patrol), the next year he 
votes for adding $60 million, then he votes to delay the 600 agents (funded) in 
his own amendment. To me this is serious business, not political business. 
</P>
<P>
 We should figure out the number of agents needed and pay for them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's yearning is woefully ill-timed. Congress has rarely been so partisan. 
Vote studies by Congressional Quarterly show that Democrats and Republicans in 
both chambers voted with the majority of their parties (and against the 
majority of the other party) more often in 1993 than in any year in the 
previous four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter is one of 11 Republicans who voted the party line 98% of the time. Only 
two others were more dutiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors converge to explain the rampant partisanship, but all spring 
from Bill Clinton's occupancy of the White House. 
</P>

 After 12 years of Republican presidents, Clinton's embrace of controversial 
issues cleaved Congress into neat partisan camps. In order to keep the Clinton 
program moving ahead, Democrats blocked more Republican floor amendments, in 
turn yielding more procedural votes that naturally break along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The net effect is that any hope for bipartisan unity -- on virtually any major 
piece of legislation -- can be kissed goodby.

 The hard-headed Hunter, a member of the House GOP leadership who recoils at 
the idea of accommodation with Democrats, can be counted on to vote the GOP 
party line -- even if it imperils his own prized legislative victories. Indeed, 
the ascension of party orthodoxy in the 103rd Congress seems to have energized 
Hunter, who likes nothing better than a good round of bruising political 
fisticuffs.

 "You have to do what you think is right, (but sometimes) you don't have a 
chance. These large spending bills are put in large blocks so the argument can 
be made that you have to vote for more spending because something you like in 
the bill will otherwise be denied. I reject that notion."

 Fifty-seven-year-old Juana Basilia Alfaro worried about her daughter's safety 
ever since that big earthquake in January, so she left her home in El Salvador 
for the long journey to Los Angeles to make sure her Silvia was safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite by chance, she joined other immigrants who had crossed the border near 
Nogales, Ariz., on Tuesday afternoon. She squeezed herself with 19 others 
inside a pickup truck that had parked along a rural highway. The group had 
pooled their money and offered the driver $600 for overnight passage to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At sunrise the next morning, as the truck traveled past Barstow, the driver 
apparently fell asleep at the wheel. The vehicle drifted off Interstate 15 and 
smashed into an earthen drainage culvert. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 20 people crammed inside the pickup, 12 were killed. The other eight -- 
including the driver -- were injured. One of the fatalities carried the address 
of Alfaro's daughter in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the San Bernardino County coroner's office, Silvia Guadalupe 
Alfaro of Los Angeles made the dreaded drive Thursday morning and confirmed her 
worst fears: Her mother was one of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Juana Basilia Alfaro had been unsuccessful in getting a visitor's visa 
during several trips to the U.S. Consulate, she apparently decided to make the 
trek north without immigration documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was coming because she loved me, to take care of me," Silvia told 
KVEA-TV outside the morgue. She had not seen her mother in several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Silvia spent the rest of the day with a psychologist. And 2,000 miles away, a 
country recovering from a dozen years of bloody civil war -- a conflict that 
sent 1 million of its people fleeing north -- mourned the loss of some of its 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a national tragedy in El Salvador," said Gerardo Sol Mixco, the 
consul general for El Salvador in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As the day grew longer, family after family drove up to the bunker-like 
coroner's office in San Bernardino. In communal embraces, in tears and in 
whispers, one by one, families went inside to face death. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, the bodies of four Salvadorans had been identified by 
relatives. Sol Mixco said they were Alfaro; Aida Hernandez, 34; Gloria Alicia 
Barrientos, 36, and Heber Noe Penate, 26.  
</P>
<P>
 The body of a fifth person, a Guatemalan, also had been identified, Sol Mixco 
said, although he did not know the name. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the tragic ride were offered Thursday by Jose Rosales, 20, whose 
survival was characterized as a miracle by his physician at San Bernardino 
County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosales said he and the other travel-weary immigrants, most from El Salvador, 
happened to fall into step as a group earlier this week. They walked across the 
border and came upon the man with a pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men joined the driver in the front seat, and a woman sat in the lap of the 
man closest to the passenger door. In the bed of the truck, under a camper 
shell, the other 16 travelers hunkered down for the last leg of their journey. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle weighed 1,700 pounds more than the manufacturer's recommended 
gross weight rating, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosales said he could recall little about the crash Wednesday morning, which 
occurred after 12 hours on the road. When he awoke on the hard desert floor, he 
tried to wake up the person lying next to him.He soon realized the person was 
dead. Then Rosales passed out again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to better my life," he said, eyes wet with emotion as a knot of 
reporters crowded around his hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
 His left leg, right ankle and collarbone were broken, and his jaw was scarred. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dev Gnanadev said the young man would probably make a full recovery, 
although his immediate future was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Los Angeles said 
the survivors would be interviewed about their immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 When their physical conditions improve, some could be deported or held as 
witnesses if criminal charges are filed against the driver, said INS spokesman 
Rico Cabrera. 
</P>
<P>
 INS investigators have not yet interviewed the driver because he remains in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol has identified him tentatively as Aidan B. 
Ordonez, and investigators planned today to take his fingerprints for positive 
identification, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, families who believed their relatives may have been in the 
pickup gathered at the offices of the Central American Resource Center, waiting 
for news. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of anguish in the community about this," said Carlos Vaquerano, 
a spokesman for the social services organization.  
</P>
<P>
 The organization has set up a Barstow Victims Fund at its Bonnie Brae Street 
office in Los Angeles. 
</P>

from San Bernardino and Nazario from Los Angeles.

OIL PRODUCERS FORGE PACT TO BUILD PIPELINE; ENVIRONMENT: THE PROJECT, WHICH 
WOULD RUN 130 MILES BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD AND THE SOUTH BAY, IS BEHIND SCHEDULE 
AND STILL FACES NUMEROUS HURDLES. BUT TANKER TRANSPORT MUST END OVER THE NEXT 
TWO YEARS.

 In a bid to settle a lengthy battle over how to transport crude oil from the 
Point Arguello offshore field near Santa Barbara, the field's major oil 
producers have signed a memorandum of understanding to build a $150-million, 
130-mile pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline project would carry oil from Bakersfield to refineries in the Los 
Angeles Basin -- including Chevron's refinery in El Segundo and Texaco's 
refinery in Wilmington -- along a route past Santa Clarita and through the San 
Fernando Valley and central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Arguello crude would reach the new line via the existing All American 
Pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 The project -- a joint venture of Chevron U.S.A. Products Co., Texaco Trading 
& Transportation Inc., Anschutz Co. and Pacific Pipeline System Inc. -- 
replaces an earlier proposed pipeline route along the coastline south of Santa 
Barbara. That route was opposed by the Los Angeles City Council, questioned by 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and eventually abandoned by Chevron as 
too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that this is a win-win-win for the county of Los Angeles," said 
Norman L. Rooney, Pacific Pipeline president. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline could provide the long-term alternative to oil tanker traffic 
along the coastline from Santa Barbara. The California Coastal Commission has 
required that tankering be eliminated over the next two years. Also, Rooney 
said, it could lessen environmental and safety risks, since it would be 
constructed using up-to-date technology that would reduce its vulnerability to 
earthquakes. It also would take some of the load off older pipelines -- one of 
which dramatically ruptured in the Northridge quake -- and trains now being 
used to bring crude oil into Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists and other critics see numerous hurdles before the 
pipeline can go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have agreed on the route, but the people on the route haven't agreed 
with them," said Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Hernandez. Hernandez 
described the route choice as "a classic example of environmental racism. . . . 
They've chosen a route through densely populated minority and high-use areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez prefers what is known as the Cajon pipeline route through the El 
Cajon Pass. In the past three years, he said, the council has voted for three 
motions opposing a permit for the section of the Pacific Pipeline route through 
heavily populated portions of the San Fernando Valley and central Los Angeles 
that remains from the earlier proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, who have opposed shipment of crude by tanker until a new 
pipeline can built, were equally skeptical of the new route's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still feel that this may be the most difficult pipeline to get through the 
(permitting) process," said Lisa Weil, policy director the American Oceans 
Campaign. Chevron and the other producers, she predicted, "will use this to 
continue to find loopholes to allow their tankering from Point Arguello to 
continue past the deadlines imposed by the Coastal Commission last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission approved the interim use of tankers by Chevron, contingent upon 
the oil companies and pipeline builders meeting several milestones. The 
producers must also end all tanker use by Jan. 1, 1996, regardless of whether a 
pipeline is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron is currently barred from using tankers because it failed to meet a 
Feb. 1 deadline that required a commitment to a specific pipeline project. It 
was also supposed to have the key permits required by various municipal 
governments and agencies with jurisdiction over the pipeline route. 
</P>
<P>
 And to get these, it has to have an approved environmental impact statement 
for the entire route. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not on schedule," said Alison Dettmer, coastal program analyst with 
the Coastal Commission. "I don't even think they can get the local approvals 
until fall of 1994, based on their current schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmentalists and regulators had expected Chevron to ask the Coastal 
Commission to amend its tanker permit and resume tanker operations because of 
the decision to back the Pacific Pipeline. But a Chevron spokesman said 
Thursday that no such request was contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the Pacific Pipeline hope to begin construction in early 1995 
and to open the line by the time tanker use must end. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo of understanding "gives us the funds to make the project work while 
we negotiate funding for the overall project," said Rooney, the Pacific 
Pipeline president. One financing agreement has already been signed, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Larry Perkins, project coordinator for Chevron U.S.A. Inc., said Chevron 
committed itself to the new route largely because it is shorter and less 
expensive than the first proposal, which would have cost $215 million, compared 
with the new route's $150-million price tag. Also, it will let the company 
transport crude oil from Kern County oil fields, which have faced a bottleneck 
coming into the Los Angeles Basin. New Route for Offshore Oil 
</P>
<P>
 In the continuing battle over shipping crude from the Point Arguello offshore 
oil fields to refineries in Los Angeles, an oil industry consortium has 
proposed a 130-mile pipeline from Bakersfield through Santa Clarita to El 
Segundo and Wilmington. The line would connect with the existing All American 
Pipeline, Council opposes the urban segment of the latest route; the proposal 
Cajon Pipeline is one alternative.

EUROPE; KOHL MAY BE PUSHING BOULDER UPHILL IN TOUGH ELECTION YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Germany's marathon election year begins Sunday with a state Parliament vote in 
Lower Saxony that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union is 
virtually certain to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kohl has been barnstorming the northern state, trying to stave off a 
snowball effect from the first of 19 votes that will culminate in a general 
election on Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The chancellor, an underdog in his own reelection bid, is reading the polls 
that give his center-right party 38% of the vote in Lower Saxony and define 
victory as anything exceeding 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kohl is concentrating on the October election and putting aside everything 
that might disturb the picture," said Martin Sueskind, Bonn bureau chief of the 
Munich daily Suddeutsche Zeitung. But he added, "The feeling of the people is 
that the CDU is on a downhill course and (that) the bandwagon will be against 
them when they are defeated in Lower Saxony." 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Democrats governed Lower Saxony for 14 years before losing to a 
coalition of the left-of-center Social Democratic Party and the Greens 
ecologists in 1990. The state's Social Democratic minister president, Gerhard 
Schroeder, is a popular figure who just might lead his party to an absolute 
majority on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 An outright victory in Lower Saxony would boost the chances of the Social 
Democratic candidate for chancellor, Rudolf Scharping, who now leads Kohl in 
opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers are watching Lower Saxony also to see if extreme rightist 
parties or new independent parties of the center right attract the 
discontented. 
</P>
<P>
 The main issue in the state and federal campaigns is the economy, and on that 
score the Christian Democrats are in bad shape. Germany is in the throes of the 
worst recession since its postwar economic miracle took off. The German welfare 
state is shrinking, and reunification has turned out to be far more costly than 
Kohl had promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment is running 10.5% nationwide and 17.1% in the former East Germany. 
Kohl fought for reunification and won reelection in 1990 with the help of 
eastern voters. But now, eastern disaffection could tip the scales against him. 
In the eastern Brandenburg local elections in December, his party came in third 
behind the former Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kohl is a wily, combative politician with a knack for comebacks, and few 
political observers are willing to write him off after 12 years in office. At 
his party's congress in Hamburg last month, Kohl quashed talk of an internal 
coup, telling his rivals to fight then and there or not at all.  
</P>
<P>
 Kohl is appealing to rightists with issues such as patriotism and family 
values and emphasizing his foreign policy experience over the economy. He is 
counting on voters to act conservatively in troubled times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lower Saxony is one part of the puzzle, but you don't know what the whole 
picture looks like," said an official close to Kohl. He added that Germans feel 
freer to protest in a local election than in a federal ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Democrats rule nationally in a coalition with the smaller Free 
Democratic Party. Some in Kohl's camp fear that if the Social Democrats do not 
win Lower Saxony outright, they could seek a coalition with the Free Democrats 
and set, one aide said, an "uncalled-for example" for the national election. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been talk in political circles that the national election results 
could be so divided that the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats would be 
forced into a "grand coalition" or co-government. Both Kohl and Scharping are 
trying to avoid that. 
</P>
<P>
 Scharping is attempting to persuade the electorate that his party is centrist, 
united and capable of governing -- not a perennial, bickering bridesmaid. 
</P>
<P>
 He is buoyed by the polls that say Germans want change. In one poll published 
Thursday by the Hamburg weekly Die Zeit, 60% of more than 1,000 Germans 
surveyed nationally said they want a change in the federal government in 
October. Discontent was clearly higher in the east, with 73% saying they want 
change compared with 57% in the west.

SOUTH ASIA; MANY PAKISTANIS IRKED BY PLAN TO HONOR A BHUTTO; A $9.4-MILLION 
TOMB IS SCHEDULED TO BE BUILT FOR EX-LEADER ZULFIKAR ALI BHUTTO, THE PREMIER'S 
FATHER. BUT HE WAS HANGED AS A MURDERER.

 Does a prime minister hanged as a murderer merit a multimillion-dollar place 
of repose? 
</P>
<P>
 Add that his daughter is now this nation's leader and the controversy that 
still swirls around the charismatic Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's tenure in office 
further heats up a sizzling political issue in Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sind, where many farm laborers live little better than medieval serfs, the 
provincial Cabinet two months ago approved construction of an imperial-sized, 
$9.4-million mausoleum for the late prime minister and rabble-rousing founder 
of the Pakistan People's Party. 
</P>
<P>
 That lavish expenditure in a province running a $233-million budget deficit, 
where impoverished city dwellers lack basic services like running water, has 
reopened debate about the larger-than-life figure known as "ZAB" and his 
checkered legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only two ways that Pakistan's most controversial politician, 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, is looked at," D. Shah Kahn, a political observer, has 
said. "Either as a knight in shining armor, who came to deliver the people from 
the drudgery of an outdated and repressive political system, or as a nemesis 
that was inflicted on Pakistan. . . . There is hardly a problem for which 
Bhutto is not blamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Not coincidentally, the late leader's daughter, Benazir, was elected to her 
second term as Pakistan's prime minister three months before the decision to 
build the tomb was made by fellow People's Party members who control Sind. 
</P>
<P>
 She has approved the plan for a 56,000-square-foot edifice at the family's 
ancestral burial ground near Larkana where Bhutto's remains are now interred. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds are supposed to come from the Sind and national governments, the 
private sector and foreign donors, with the mix still a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
 Because Bhutto's 1971-77 reign remains a watershed in Pakistani life, the vote 
by Sind's leaders couldn't help but stir big controversy. And since Benazir 
Bhutto's appeal and support repose in large part on her claim to her father's 
populist mantle, the real issue is not history, but present-day politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was wicked and a villain," Muhammad Siddique Farooque, spokesman of the 
opposition Pakistan Muslim League, said predictably of the late creator of his 
party's bitterest and most successful rival. "People hold him responsible for 
the dismemberment of Pakistan. He used coercive methods, had people killed and 
beaten." 
</P>
<P>
 Some newspapers have objected that Bhutto's legacy is too disputed for the 
public to spend money on his tomb or the separate memorial complex that his 
daughter wants to build in Rawalpindi on the site of his death. They suggest 
that People's Party members and other sympathizers contribute money instead. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Bhutto was hanged in a cell in the Central Jail here, a year and a 
half after being deposed by Gen. Zia ul-Haq. The feudal landholder who rocketed 
to power with his spellbinding harangues in favor of "Islamic socialism" had 
been tried and found guilty of abetting the murder of an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no underestimating the significance of his deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 On the positive side: Bhutto framed Pakistan's 1973 constitution, the first in 
the country's history passed by a legislature elected on the basis of one 
citizen, one vote. He demanded that Pakistan become self-reliant in the nuclear 
field, which from a Pakistani point of view made the country able to treat 
India as an equal, since it is believed capable of producing an atomic bomb. He 
gave people hope that their miserable lives could be better. 
</P>
<P>
 The minus side: By refusing to deal with the party that won a majority in East 
Pakistan in 1970, the autocratic Bhutto may have served as a catalyst for the 
breakup of the country and the creation of present-day Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he dismissed the left-wing government in the province of Baluchistan, 
touching off an insurgency in which about 10,000 people perished. A New Bhutto 
Bombshell 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistanis are deeply divided over the decision by lawmakers in an 
impoverished region to spend $9.4 million for a mausoleum for Zulfikar Ali 
Bhutto, the former prime minister, hanged as a murder. The project was backed 
by his daughter, present Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The Bhutto legacy 
remains hot and divisive for Pakistan: Was he a hero a villain for this nation?

CHRISTOPHER WON'T MEET CHINA DISSIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Thursday that he has no plans to 
meet with any political dissidents when he visits Beijing this weekend, and one 
of his top aides hinted that Chinese officials may have asked the secretary not 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, the Chinese government rounded up several prominent dissidents, 
including Wei Jingsheng, the country's best-known advocate of democracy.Wei was 
subsequently freed. There had been speculation that he or some other Chinese 
dissidents would meet with Christopher during the secretary's visit to Beijing, 
which starts tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 By scuttling such a meeting, the Chinese government would keep the dissidents 
out of the spotlight and prevent them from gaining a platform from which to 
disseminate their views. Chinese leaders would also be able to maintain the 
outward appearance of unity and consensus that, even in times of internal 
struggle, they try to present to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked at a news conference in Tokyo whether he will see any advocates of 
democracy during his Beijing trip, Christopher carefully replied, "I don't have 
any plans to do so at the present time." Several aides went further, saying no 
such meeting is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, Chinese dissidents issued statements on human rights and 
announced the formation of a labor union.

BLACK HOMELAND REGIME NEAR COLLAPSE; SOUTH AFRICA: LEADER OF BOPHUTHATSWANA

<P>
 The bizarre black homeland government of Bophuthatswana, one of the strangest 
creations of apartheid, appeared close to collapse Thursday night after four 
days of raucous strikes, running street battles and scattered gunfire in the 
tiny capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of chanting, cheering protesters celebrated by looting shops and 
burning and stoning vehicles in the dusty streets of Mmabatho after local radio 
reported that the autocratic president, Lucas Mangope, had fled by helicopter. 
His whereabouts could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mangope clearly had lost control, since his once-feared police and 
military forces were crumbling in the face of demonstrators' demands that the 
nominally independent homeland be reincorporated into South Africa and its 
voters be allowed to take part in the country's first free, all-race elections 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Mmabatho was quiet by midnight, residents said, with police manning roadblocks 
around government buildings and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 But early today, South African army troops took up positions at the South 
African Embassy in Mmabatho. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, armed white extremists streamed into Bophuthatswana. There 
were no immediate reports of clashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha said the troops had been sent in 
because of unrest Thursday and the deployment of white rightists. Botha, in a 
statement released early today, said their main mission was to protect embassy 
staff and their families but that they also were on hand "to maintain law and 
order and to protect South African citizens and their interests should the 
situation deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone in Mangope's civil service, from firefighters to teachers, 
honored a general strike Thursday to protest his repressive policies. Shops 
were shuttered, offices closed. And senior members of his handpicked 
administration had deserted the smoke-filled, embattled capital. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, hundreds of local troops and police had joined the 
uprising, allowing students to climb atop armored military vehicles and 
defiantly wave flags in support of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people, including a policeman, were reported killed and more than 70 
injured in clashes this week. At least 37 were wounded Wednesday by police 
firing buckshot and tear gas in tense running battles through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 International observer missions, who are flooding into South Africa for the 
elections, issued an appeal for peace. "We deplore the use of force and call on 
all concerned, and particularly the security forces of Bophuthatswana, to 
prevent further casualties and loss of life," said the statement, issued by the 
U.N., Organization of African Unity, European Union and Commonwealth observer 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangope has refused to take part in South Africa's historic elections next 
month. More important, he announced that he would not let other political 
parties campaign in his territory nor permit polls to open for the estimated 
1.4 million voters in his nominal control. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangope, 69, insists his country is free and independent. But South Africa is 
the only nation to recognize it. He has ruled with near-dictatorial powers 
since the engineers of apartheid created Bop, as it is called, and nine other 
homelands and territories in the 1970s as a way of separating the races. 
</P>
<P>
 Bop became the most successful of the homelands, drawing rich revenues from 
platinum mines and gambling casinos at Sun City.  
</P>
<P>
 All the homelands are to be abolished after the April 26-28 election and 
reincorporated into South Africa, according to the interim constitution.

NIXON IGNORES YELTSIN SNUB, SAYS 'I REMAIN HIS FRIEND'; RUSSIA: FORMER 
PRESIDENT WAS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING GAFFE BY MEETING FIRST WITH OPPOSITION 
FIGURE RUTSKOI. 
</P>

<P>
 Ignoring a public snub, former U.S. President Richard Nixon said Thursday that 
his friendship and support for Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin remain 
untarnished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here as his friend and I remain his friend. I wish him well," Nixon 
said at a reception in his honor given by the U.S. ambassador. No high-ranking 
Russian official attended. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, an angry Yeltsin had announced that neither he nor any member 
of his government would receive the 81-year-old former President, one of 
Yeltsin's earliest supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin aides said Thursday that Nixon's transgression was meeting with 
opposition leaders before first paying his respects to Yeltsin. Especially 
offensive to Yeltsin was Nixon's Monday meeting with former Vice President 
Alexander V. Rutskoi, who was recently released from jail after being accused 
of treason in attempting to overthrow Yeltsin last October. Rutskoi now intends 
to run for president of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The president was absolutely right not to receive Nixon because the latter's 
schedule initially contained disrespect to Russian statehood," Foreign Minister 
Andrei V. Kozyrev said in a television interview. "The problem is not that he 
met with representatives of the opposition, or people who are closer to 
criminals, to my mind, than to the opposition. The problem is that he did it 
wrong, in the wrong order, ignoring courtesy and tact." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nixon aide Dmitri K. Simes said it was the Yeltsin administration that had 
suggested the dates for Nixon's visit; then, at the last moment, officials said 
Yeltsin would not be able to see Nixon until the very end of his trip. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to further aggravate Russian-Western relations, Russian authorities 
Thursday arrested a man who they said was a German spy, the Interfax news 
agency reported, citing "a well-informed source." The arrest could not be 
confirmed, and no other details were available. 
</P>
<P>
 If that report is true, the arrest would be the latest salvo in a new 
espionage war between Russia and the West that began last month with the 
American arrest of CIA official Aldrich H. Ames and his wife on charges of 
spying for Moscow.  
</P>
<P>
 At the reception Thursday night, Nixon, the picture of diplomacy, steered 
clear of these sore spots and took pains to soothe Russia's wounded superpower 
pride. Nixon took issue with recent suggestions that Russia is no longer a 
great power to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is a great power, has been in the past and will be in the future," he 
said. Russia and the United States will continue to have differences, he said, 
but they will be more like the frictions between the Americans and Britain or 
France. "The differences will be between friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon also reminisced about previous visits to Moscow. Traffic, he said, is 
much fiercer than when he stayed in the Kremlin as the guest of Soviet leader 
Leonid I. Brezhnev. "It's worse than the Santa Ana Freeway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still unclear whether Nixon will meet with ultranationalist leader 
Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky.

SPY SUSPECTS ORDERED TO TRANSFER OVERSEAS MONEY TO U.S.; ESPIONAGE: FEDERAL 
JUDGE SEES 'SUBSTANTIAL PROBABILITY' AMES AND HIS WIFE WILL BE CONVICTED. 
FREEZE ON THEIR DOMESTIC HOLDINGS IS EXTENDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge, declaring that there is "a substantial probability" accused 
spies Aldrich H. Ames and his wife will be convicted of espionage, Thursday 
ordered them to transfer to their U.S. accounts hundreds of thousands of 
dollars from overseas banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruling at the request of federal prosecutors, U.S. District Judge Claude 
Hilton also extended indefinitely a freeze on the Ameses' domestic holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark J. Hulkower told the court that the couple had 
"dissipated" most of the estimated $2.5 million they received from their 
Russian handlers, leaving the government well short of recovering all of their 
ill-gotten gains. 
</P>
<P>
 At a two-hour court hearing, an FBI official also disclosed that Aldrich Ames' 
superiors at the CIA first were alerted to his sudden wealth in 1989 when he 
paid cash for a $540,000 house in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time anyone had given such an early date for the CIA's 
initial tip that Ames had wealth beyond the means provided by his agency 
salary. Some members of Congress have criticized the CIA for not moving sooner 
against Ames, whose spending later included buying a 1992 Jaguar and the 
expenditure of $99,000 for improvements on his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames was questioned about the purchase of the house during a routine lie 
detector test that CIA officers are given periodically. But he convinced his 
superiors that he had inherited money from his father-in-law in Colombia, FBI 
supervising agent Leslie G. Wiser Jr. testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiser said that the Ameses began depositing tens of thousands of dollars in 
cash in Washington area bank accounts beginning in 1985, when authorities 
allege his espionage began, but sought to avoid scrutiny by making individual 
deposits of less than $10,000, the threshold at which banks are required to 
report transactions to the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Plato Cacheris, Ames' attorney, argued in vain that prosecutors had failed to 
prove that funds held by Ames in five bank accounts in Switzerland, Italy and 
Colombia are linked to allegations of espionage. Restraining the funds also 
imposes "a severe hardship" on the family, especially the care of the Ameses' 
5-year-old son, Cacheris contended. 
</P>
<P>
 In ordering the Ameses to transfer the money, however, Hilton agreed with 
Hulkower that funds overseas would not be subject to control by the U.S. 
government if the couple is convicted. He said that they probably could not be 
forced to forfeit those funds under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Hulkower said that Swiss officials, despite a mutual assistance agreement with 
U.S. law enforcement officers, have refused to freeze the accounts or even 
provide information about them on grounds that espionage is a political crime 
not covered by the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lack of security for foreign funds unless he is ordered to bring 
the money back here," Hulkower told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors stressed that Hilton's orders only place restraints on the Ameses' 
money and do not amount to seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, a 31-year veteran of the agency, at one time served as chief of Soviet 
counterintelligence in the CIA's Soviet-East European division. He and his wife 
were arrested on Feb. 21, nine months after being placed under surveillance by 
the FBI, when officials feared that they were about to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing olive-drab prison clothing, the Ameses exchanged frequent whispers as 
they sat in court behind their defense lawyers. Rosario Ames shook her head to 
signal "no" when Wiser said that after her arrest she had admitted her husband 
received millions of dollars from the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, when Ames was posted to Rome for three years to help recruit spies 
for the CIA, he already was passing information to the Russians, officials 
said. Once overseas, he suspended his cautious practice of making limited cash 
deposits and instead began funneling up to $1.9 million through accounts in 
Switzerland and Italy, then wire-transferred $600,000 to his U.S. bank 
accounts, an act that would not trigger any federal reporting, Wiser testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiser said that the CIA learned Ames had foreign bank accounts sometime 
between 1990 and 1992 but apparently did not determine that he was spying, even 
though his official government salary never exceeded $69,000 annually.

GOP SENATOR PLEADS INNOCENT TO FALSE CLAIMS 
</P>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) pleaded innocent Thursday to charges of 
falsifying his Senate expense account to collect $3,825. 
</P>
<P>
 Durenberger has denied any criminal wrongdoing and said in a statement 
Thursday: "I am absolutely confident that I will be exonerated in a trial and I 
look forward to vindication." 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer asked U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Harris to transfer the case to 
a federal court in Minnesota. There was no immediate ruling on that request. 
</P>
<P>
 Durenberger said "not guilty" when asked how he pleaded to the charges. Harris 
allowed him to remain free on his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator is charged with making false claims to the Senate and with 
conspiring to make false claims. If convicted on both felony counts, he could 
face up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Durenberger, who is leaving the Senate after this year, was formally denounced 
by Senate colleagues in 1990 for the alleged financial improprieties.

1993 AIDS CASES ROSE 111%, WITH WIDER DEFINITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of new AIDS cases unexpectedly more than doubled last year under a 
broader definition of the disease and a sharp increase in the number of 
infections among heterosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had projected that 1993 
AIDS cases would jump 75% in the first year of the new definition.It actually 
increased by 111%, from 49,016 in 1992 to 103,500 in 1993, the agency reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the CDC expanded its definition to include those infected with HIV 
who also have a severely suppressed immune system, tuberculosis, recurrent 
pneumonia or invasive cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the AIDS cases under the new definition were reported in the first 
three months of the year. The surge had dropped off by the end of 1993, and CDC 
officials said they expect the number of 1994 cases to drop below last year's 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups most affected by the expanded definition were women, blacks, 
heterosexual intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS cases resulting from heterosexual contact jumped 130% last year over 
1992, from 4,045 to 9,288. Women accounted for about two-thirds of heterosexual 
cases, but the number of men who are infected through heterosexual contact also 
is increasing.

GOP EXPECTS A BONANZA AS POLLS SHOW HARM FROM WHITEWATER; POLITICS: SOME 
REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS SAY IMPACT COULD EXTEND TO FALL ELECTIONS. WILL 
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM CLINTON? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican strategists, already savoring the discomfort inflicted on President 
Clinton by the burgeoning Whitewater controversy, now hope to reap a much 
larger political bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
 With polls showing Whitewater hurting both the President and the First Lady, 
some GOP officials said that the impact could extend to Democrats running in 
next November's congressional races and inflict long-term damage on the 
national party as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Paxon (R-N.Y.), chairman of the GOP Congressional Campaign 
Committee, said Thursday that Clinton is becoming "a serious liability" to 
Democratic candidates. A year ago they would have sought his support, he said, 
but "a majority of them now probably will distance themselves from him." 
</P>
<P>
 If Republicans register gains in Congress and Clinton is further weakened, the 
result could be a major setback in the Democrats' efforts to regain their old 
dominance of national politics. And the GOP has developed a two-part strategy 
to pursue that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans in Congress are keeping up attacks that have already led to the 
appointment of a special Whitewater counsel, the firing of White House lawyer 
Bernard Nussbaum and heavy pressure for full-blown congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, GOP Chairman Haley Barbour, in Denver attending a national 
meeting of state Republican chairmen, said that the party's strategy outside 
Washington is to leave Whitewater to the press. Almost daily reports of 
document shredding, improper White House meetings and other alleged misconduct 
have kept the White House on the defensive and the issue at a fast boil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats have this fraudulent defense that it's all being stirred up by 
the Republicans," Barbour said. "When the Washington Post, L.A. Times and New 
York Times dig all this stuff up, they can't say it's Republicans doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have been attacking Clinton on the Whitewater issue for several 
months and Barbour, in an interview with Denver Post editors Wednesday, 
declared that, while he doesn't know what the Clintons did, "they are doing the 
best job of looking guilty I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Democrats in Congress have launched similar steady attacks 
on Republican presidents in the past. Democrats dogged President George Bush in 
the controversy over diversion of U.S. aid that helped arm Iraq in the years 
before the 1991 Persian Gulf War. They also attacked President Ronald Reagan 
over the Iran-Contra scandal, which involved sale of U.S. arms to Iran in 
exchange for the release of American hostages, with proceeds from those sales 
going to finance Contra rebels in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases the Democratic majority in Congress conducted sweeping hearings 
into the controversies -- a step that it is now resisting on Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Some GOP officials attending the Denver meeting, apparently unaware of 
Barbour's strategy of leaving Whitewater to the press, were outspoken in saying 
that it would hurt the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 California Republican Chairman Tirso del Junco called Whitewater "more serious 
than Watergate" and Jeanie Austin, who jointly chairs the Republican National 
Committee, called it "definitely a negative for Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour said that he has refused to go on television to discuss the issue and 
"abet my adversaries' defense." Democrats, he said, tried to get him to appear 
on television with Democratic Chairman David Wilhelm "but I've turned them 
down. It would make it look political." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm said that he had agreed to go on a television show with Barbour, but 
he vehemently denied that Democrats had tried to get the Republican chairman to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to go on television with him," Wilhelm said. "That's a pretty 
transparent argument he's making. The Republican Party is basing its entire 
strategy on Whitewater. It's their great political hope. They have nothing to 
say on health care or welfare reform or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans, including former Vice President Dan Quayle, have raised the 
specter of Watergate. And Rep. James H. Quillen (R-Tenn.), who has called on 
Clinton to resign, said that all telephone calls to his office have favored his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), who has led the attack in the House, insisted 
that, while he expects hearings into Whitewater eventually to produce "a 
blockbuster," he believes that any remedies for wrongdoing will be civil rather 
than criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), who has pressed the attack in the Senate and 
pushed for congressional hearings, insists that "this is not an attempt to 
injure the presidency." 
</P>
<P>
 But his attacks have gotten under the President's skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans have decided that Sen. D'Amato will be the ethical spokesman 
for the Republican Party in the Congress," Clinton declared at one of two press 
conferences this week at which he discussed Whitewater. The comment was a 
sarcastic reference to an old Senate Ethics Committee inquiry that ended in 
1991 with a rebuke of D'Amato for not preventing his brother from using his 
office on behalf of a defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) has dismissed the idea of 
congressional hearings as "a political circus" and said: "All they want to do 
is to throw up a lot of dust and embarrass the President." And several 
Democratic senators, including John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV of West Virginia 
and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, rose to Clinton's defense on the Senate floor 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), declaring that Congress has a 
clear right to conduct hearings, said: "Let's stop all the finger-pointing and 
let's get on with the hearings." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign 
Committee, said whether Whitewater remains an issue in the future will "depend 
mostly on what the President does now, and to a secondary extent what he did in 
the past." 
</P>

EX-CLINTON PARTNER SAYS PAPERS IN FOSTER'S OFFICE BELONG TO HIM; ARKANSAS: 
MCDOUGAL CLAIMS WHITEWATER FILES WERE LOANED TO WHITE HOUSE AIDE FOR HIM TO DO 
TAXES ON FAILED REAL ESTATE PROJECT. NEW DETAILS EMERGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Whitewater papers found in the White House office of the late Vincent 
Foster were legally the property of James B. McDougal, President Clinton's 
former business partner, and were not intended to be in Foster's possession at 
the time of his death, according to several sources involved in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Whitewater controversy erupted in December with the discovery that 
a White House official had found the papers in Foster's office shortly after 
his apparent suicide in July and had transferred them quietly to the Clintons' 
private attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The new details, provided by McDougal in an interview at the home of a friend 
here and by sources who did not want to be identified, provide insight into the 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of a December, 1992, contract by which Clinton and his wife, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, sold their interest in the Whitewater Development Corp. 
to McDougal, Foster was to have prepared the land company's delinquent taxes 
and promptly return all Whitewater-related documents to McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foster was swamped with his duties as deputy White House counsel and 
feeling pressure because of failed White House nominations and the botched 
firing of five aides in the White House travel office. He delayed preparing the 
tax returns for six months, and the papers still sat in his office at the time 
of his apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vince had them because he had been working on the taxes, and then he killed 
himself before returning them," said a senior White House official involved in 
handling the Whitewater case. "Instead of McDougal having them, we had them, 
and the rest is history." 
</P>
<P>
 The papers, which McDougal said are a much more complete record of 
Whitewater's finances than the Clinton representatives have acknowledged, were 
found in Foster's office within hours of his death on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, who announced his resignation last 
weekend amid continuing Whitewater revelations, quietly removed them from 
Foster's office and sent them to David Kendall, the Clintons' private attorney. 
Kendall declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons initially refused to release the papers to the Justice 
Department, which was investigating the failure of a savings and loan owned by 
McDougal. They yielded only after Kendall negotiated the terms of a Justice 
Department subpoena that covered a wide range of Clinton papers. 
</P>
<P>
 But questions about the Clintons' handling of the matter persisted for weeks, 
finally forcing them reluctantly to approve the appointment of a special 
counsel to investigate the Whitewater case. Robert B. Fiske Jr., a Republican 
from New York, subsequently was named to the post. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview this week, McDougal said that -- when the Clintons sold their 
interest in the Whitewater real estate project to him in December, 1992, for 
$1,000 -- the contract called for the tax returns to be prepared by Foster, a 
longtime friend of the Clintons and, like Mrs. Clinton, a former partner in the 
prestigious Rose Law Firm in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract gave Foster 90 days to complete the task. Afterward, he was to 
return all the underlying documentation to McDougal or to his Little Rock 
attorney, Sam Heuer. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal said that Foster was working from the only complete set of Whitewater 
financial documents, including the general ledger, deeds and contracts, records 
of all land transactions, canceled checks and previous tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal said that he had sent all this material to the Clintons at the 
Arkansas governor's mansion in December, 1987. The papers were physically 
handed over to the Clintons by William Henley, the brother of McDougal's 
ex-wife, Susan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the 90-day period in which he was to complete the tax 
returns, Foster called Heuer to plead for more time. Those early weeks of the 
Clinton Administration had been hectic, including the controversies over the 
nomination of Zoe Baird and probable nomination of Kimba M. Wood to be attorney 
general and numerous other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vince told me he had an incredible workload and couldn't get these taxes done 
this quickly," Heuer said in an interview. "I told him not to worry about it, 
and ultimately he did produce them." 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal said that he began to grow impatient by June and called Foster's 
office to learn what had become of the taxes and the Whitewater papers. "He 
never called back," McDougal said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Heuer said that Foster called "sometime in June" to say that he was 
"getting the taxes together." Heuer said he received a packet containing the 
completed returns from an accounting firm hired by Foster to do the final tax 
filings in the summer of 1993, a few weeks after Foster's death. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the Whitewater papers used to prepare the returns -- the complete 
Whitewater financial record -- were not returned with the tax papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Heuer said that although his client is entitled to the Whitewater papers, he 
is not interested in pursuing the matter now. "How can I call the President of 
the United States and say: 'Give me the documents?' " Heuer said. "Besides, I'd 
just have to bear the cost of copying them and turning them over to the special 
prosecutor."

REVIVAL OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMIT SOUGHT; POLITICS: PROP. 73 WAS RULED 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN 1992, BUT ITS BACKERS ARE ASKING THE STATE SUPREME COURT TO 
AMEND THE MEASURE'S OBJECTIONABLE PROVISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Backers of Proposition 73, a successful 1988 state ballot measure that limited 
campaign contributions in state and local elections but was later struck down 
by federal courts, have launched an effort to revive the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia) and state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp, an 
independent from San Francisco, are planning to file legal papers Monday asking 
the California Supreme Court to correct any unconstitutional provisions and 
reinstitute the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's precedent for the court going in and modifying ballot measures to 
clear up constitutional questions and fulfill the wishes of the voters," 
Johnson said Thursday. "We intend to ask them to do just that." 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of Proposition 73 was declared unconstitutional in a February, 1992, 
final ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court ruled 
that the measure discriminated by favoring incumbents because its contribution 
limits -- $1,000 for individuals and businesses and $5,000 for political action 
committees -- were based on a fiscal year instead of an election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Since challengers usually do not decide to run until a few months before an 
election, the appeals court declared, incumbents would have an advantage under 
Proposition 73 to build up large campaign war chests by tapping contributors 
several times in the years before an election. They suggested that the law 
instead should have been based on an election cycle, meaning a donor could give 
up to the limit only one time before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson still disagrees with the ruling, but said he and Kopp believe the 
state Supreme Court can easily fix any flaws in the law -- and that the 
justices have suggested they would be willing to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas said in a December ruling on a related case that 
the constitutional questions underlying the rejection of Proposition 73 are 
matters of state law. In a footnote to the written opinion, Lucas said "one can 
only wonder" why backers of Proposition 73 had not asked the state Supreme 
Court to step in. Problems with the measure, Lucas said, "are arguably 
susceptible to a construction by the state's highest court that repairs any 
constitutional infirmity." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the chief justice was suggesting the state Supreme Court might 
be able to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't have a more direct invitation," Johnson said. "Clearly they have 
the power to recast the language of the measure to remove any problems and 
effectuate the intent of the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Some participants in the fight for campaign-finance reform welcomed news of 
the effort by Johnson and Kopp, who co-authored Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just my own opinion, but at this point I think any limitation would 
be better than what we have now," said Bob Stern, co-director of the California 
Commission on Campaign Financing, a private research organization. "It has its 
flaws, but at the same time it will start to clean up the process and reduce 
the perception that government is corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
 But others expressed concern. Ruth Holton, executive director of California 
Common Cause, a political watchdog group, said she is concerned about reviving 
Proposition 73 because "contribution limits themselves don't answer the whole 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have elected officials simply spending more time raising money," 
Holton said. "You need the counterbalance of spending limits and public 
financing." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 73 was approved by 58% of the voters in the June, 1988, election, 
beating out a rival campaign-finance measure, Proposition 68, which got 53% of 
the vote. The election came amid growing concerns that the huge amount of 
campaign cash contributed to lawmakers each year by special-interest groups was 
having a corrupting influence on the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Although voters approved both, the measures have mostly been mired in the 
courts ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 68, which included spending limits and public financing of races, 
was almost immediately thrown out by the courts because its rival got more 
votes -- and included a ban on public financing. Proposition 73, meanwhile, was 
in effect for the 1990 elections, and dramatically reduced the amount of 
campaign cash contributed. It dropped from $79.4 million in 1988 to $52 million 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from contribution limits, the measure included a ban on transfers of 
campaign cash between candidates, a tactic commonly used by legislative leaders 
to maintain their hold on power. Its campaign finance restrictions applied to 
candidates for local and state office. 
</P>
<P>
 When the measure was ruled unconstitutional in 1992, backers of the rival 
Proposition 68 responded by asking the state Supreme Court to reinstitute their 
campaign finance proposal, reasoning that it had gotten a majority vote and 
would fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
 Their pleas were rejected in the December opinion written by Lucas. But the 
same ruling yielded the revelation that the state Supreme Court justices might 
be willing to tinker with Proposition 73 to make it pass constitutional muster.

CLINTON CALLS ON YOUTHS TO HELP CURB VIOLENCE; CRIME: HE PROMOTES HIS NATIONAL 
SERVICE PROGRAM AT BROOKLYN COLLEGE. HE URGES POLITICIANS TO LOWER THEIR OWN 
LEVEL OF HOSTILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton urged young people Thursday to join in neighborhood efforts 
to reduce violence -- and pointedly called on his neighbors in Washington's 
political precincts to tone down their own level of hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech pitching his Americorps national service plan to students at 
Brooklyn College, Clinton likened the social impact of Washington's political 
combat to that created by "the cumulative, instantaneous, reactive, macho 
violence you see in media entertainment programs." 
</P>
<P>
 "When people turn on television and they see their national government, what 
do you inevitably see?" Clinton said. "People with words, using extreme words 
to characterize conduct or activity or positions. The other politicians do it, 
the media do it; always trying to twist it like taffy to the nth degree." 
</P>
<P>
 The President included his own behavior in his criticism, adding: "I think all 
of us in positions of public responsibility need to think about that, need to 
think about what kind of message we are sending to young people when they see 
that kind of conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton never mentioned the ongoing controversy over his financial dealings in 
the Whitewater real estate partnership in Arkansas. But the flap has turned the 
last several weeks into some of the most bruising of his presidency. Although a 
federal prosecutor already is investigating allegations that Clinton may have 
benefited improperly from his investment in the Whitewater Development Corp. 
and his relationship with the former owner of a failed savings and loan, 
Republicans have intensified their efforts to force congressional hearings on 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how many people -- I've had older members of the Congress tell 
me just in the last week how much meaner and partisan and negative the national 
arena is," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the speech, Clinton wove together three of his favorite themes -- 
crime reduction, national service and spiritual renewal -- in a call for 
Americans to help "reclaim our streets, our schools, our communities and our 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Evoking the memory of Kitty Genovese -- a young woman murdered 30 years ago in 
the neighboring New York borough of Queens while dozens of neighbors ignored 
her cries for help -- Clinton portrayed his national service plan as a way for 
Americans to both combat crime and rebuild lapsed bonds of community. "It is 
not enough for any of us to ever say again what was said here 30 years ago: 'I 
don't want to get involved,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's national service program, which allows young people to earn 
college scholarship money by working in neighborhood organizations, will begin 
this summer. In a so-called "summer of safety," Americorps intends to place 
about 6,000 volunteers in anti-crime initiatives, ranging from support 
positions in police departments to youth counseling programs. The full program, 
which will begin this fall, is expected to place as many as 20,000 volunteers 
in an array of service groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Clinton toured a Brooklyn police precinct and met privately 
with Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York's Republican mayor. Giuliani had refused to 
attend the Brooklyn College forum.

WHITE HOUSE AIDS ROSTENKOWSKI BY HERALDING CHICAGO JOB CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration gave an eleventh-hour boost Thursday to Rep. Dan 
Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), the embattled chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, by announcing that a federal Job Corps center will be built in his 
hometown of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich came to Rostenkowski's Capitol Hill office 
with the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year House veteran is at the center of a two-year federal grand jury 
investigation into his financial affairs, including an allegation that he 
improperly traded $22,000 worth of postage stamps for cash. A federal 
prosecutor here has said the inquiry is in its final stages but no grand jury 
action is expected before Tuesday's primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Perceived as politically weakened by the controversy, he has found himself in 
a tough, five-way race in which his leading opponents are Chicago Alderman Dick 
Simpson and state Sen. John Cullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Job Corps facility will not be in Rostenkowski's congressional 
district, he was portrayed as its major sponsor. The center is expected to 
provide job skills for 500 young people annually. Construction costs are 
expected to range from $20 million to $30 million, and annual operating costs 
have been projected at $6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a giant step forward," Rostenkowski said, as Chicago Mayor 
Richard M. Daley listened on a speaker phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich said the event was not staged to help Rostenkowski's reelection and 
noted that Chicago was among nine cities chosen as Job Corps sites. The other 
eight locations were announced without the same fanfare, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chairman and the chairman's office were very helpful in providing 
technical assistance for the application," Reich said without smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 And a beaming Rostenkowski seemed glad to claim whatever credit might come his 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a congressman and this is what I do and I'm glad to bring home the 
bacon," he said. Asked whether he thought the announcement would help his 
campaign, he replied: "I hope so. I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton virtually endorsed Rostenkowski in a visit to Chicago last 
week, terming him indispensable for passage of health care legislation and the 
Administration's other high-priority measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich's announcement fit neatly into the theme of the Chicago Democrat's 
reelection effort: that he can do more for Chicago because of his seniority and 
his chairmanship of one of the most powerful committees in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois Democratic Sens. Paul Simon and Carol Moseley-Braun attended the 
ceremony in Rostenkowski's office as a show of support for their colleague. 
Although they stopped short of formal endorsements, both had kind words for the 
struggling candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny Rostenkowski has provided real leadership -- a willingness to do gutsy 
things," Simon said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just delighted to be part of this group," Moseley-Braun said.

NAVY SECRETARY ASSAILS SEX ABUSE, MILITARY POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Navy Secretary John H. Dalton said Thursday that he is embarrassed by 
allegations of unpunished sexual harassment in the military and dissatisfied 
with Pentagon policies against abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton's comments before the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee came a 
day after four women, representing the four military services, told a House 
committee that they were sexually harassed and then punished or put in dead-end 
jobs for complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the harassers went unpunished or received mild reprimands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reading those statements made my blood boil," Dalton told Sen. Arlen Specter 
(R-Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Secretary, those allegations were not exactly news," Specter replied. 
"The essence of the complaint is that their grievances were not taken 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton described a "traffic light" strategy in which Navy personnel are 
educated on the kinds of comments and behavior that cross the line of 
propriety. But he said more must be done to ensure that allegations are treated 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not pleased with the level of progress," Dalton said. "If those 
statements we heard yesterday are any indication, I'm embarrassed by it." 
</P>
<P>
 The most extensive and emotional testimony Wednesday came from a Navy 
lieutenant and a Marine sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines are part of the Navy Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony was particularly embarrassing to the Navy after the 
much-criticized investigation into the 1991 Tailhook Assn. convention. Scores 
of women have said they were abused and harassed during the convention by 
drunken Navy fliers at a Las Vegas hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Adm. Frank B. Kelso II, chief of naval operations, who moved up his retirement 
date after the Tailhook scandal, accompanied Dalton at the hearing Thursday but 
said nothing about the latest allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Defense Secretary Edwin Dorn acknowledged Wednesday that "some 
egregious cases of sexual harassment have been handled incompetently and 
insensitively."

RACE AGAIN CROPS UP AS THORNY ISSUE IN PANEL'S MAKEUP; GRAND JURY: CRITICISM 
HAS CENTERED ON PREDOMINATE USE OF WHITES IN CASES INVOLVING MINORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In rejecting the recommendations of the district attorney's office and 
refusing to charge a white sheriff's deputy with manslaughter in the shooting 
death of a black fellow officer, the Orange County Grand Jury finds itself once 
again at the center of a controversy involving race. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the grand jury system in Orange County was attacked as lacking 
ethnic diversity and racial sensitivity after it recommended a moratorium on 
all immigration to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsequent public outcry, primarily from Latino groups, drew the interest 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, which is investigating claims of 
institutional racism in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, attorneys in the murder case stemming from the bludgeoning 
death of high school honor student Stuart A. Tay argued loudly, but 
unsuccessfully, that the grand jury's indictments against several Asian 
defendants in the case should be thrown out because Asians had been 
systematically excluded from serving on the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge ruled there was no legal requirement for "quotas" on the jury, after a 
population expert testified during a hearing on the case that there appeared to 
have been a "systematic exclusion of Asians and other minorities" in assembling 
the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 When the next grand jury was impaneled last July 1, it consisted of 15 whites, 
two Latinos, one African American and one Native American. Their average age 
was 64. At least one Latino alternate has replaced the American Indian juror 
during the year. The two previous juries were overwhelmingly elderly and white. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's population, according to the most recent census figures, is 
65% white, 23% Latino, 10% Asian and 2% African American. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no evidence has surfaced in the shooting death of Deputy Darryn 
Robins to suggest that race played a part, minority groups raised concerns over 
the speed and thoroughness of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many were particularly upset by a lack of public information in the case and 
pushed unsuccessfully for state and federal civil rights investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall M. Schulman, one of the defense attorneys in the Tay case who had 
argued for greater diversity on the grand jury, said he has no reason to 
believe that race was a factor in the grand jury's decision not to indict 
Deputy Brian P. Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 But he renewed his call to keep the grand jury out of the business of weighing 
indictments in criminal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grand jury may be a fine watchdog group for governmental oversight," he 
said. "But when it comes to indictments, we don't need them." Alluding to the 
total secrecy surrounding grand jury proceedings, Schulman said it was better 
to "get everything out in the open and heard in front of regular people sitting 
on a regular jury. Not just these handpicked old folks." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is a 19-member independent panel of citizens that serves mostly 
as a watchdog, in that it it analyzes and investigates claims of government 
waste and inefficiency. But the jury, whose members are selected by local 
judges, can also bring charges against defendants in criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although representatives of the grand jury say they constantly seek a more 
diverse mix of applicants, they say few minorities are willing to tackle the 
job, which pays $25 each day the grand jury meets and often requires five-day 
workweeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the grand jury produced a report calling on county officials to 
try to attract a larger pool of jury candidates by producing public service 
announcements, brochures, flyers and other advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 There are indications that some of the measures may be working. Applications 
for the 1994-95 grand jury showed an increase in diversity in age, gender and 
race, some grand jurors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There definitely needs to be more minorities on it. You do not get a cross 
section of the community," said Jerry A. Matney, 61, who would have been on 
this year's grand jury if not for a back injury that forced him to surrender 
his position. "The problem is, you've got to be wealthy, a housewife or 
retired." 
</P>
<P>
 When the 1993-94 grand jury went through its weeklong training course last 
year, one member made the lack of minorities an issue, Matney said, "even to 
the point that this person wanted to help subsidize minorities to be on it." 
Matney declined to name the individual.

D.A.'S PROBES OF SHOOTINGS CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a matter of policy, the Orange County district attorney's office routinely 
investigates all cases in which a police officer shoots and wounds or kills 
someone.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite an increasing number of such shootings, from about 10 each year in the 
early 1980s to 30 in 1990, the district attorney's office has not filed 
criminal charges against an on-duty officer for a shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say that an investigation by an independent, outside agency such as 
the district attorney's office should ensure that the public will have more 
faith in the outcome, and forestalls the criticism that comes when police 
investigate themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting victims and their survivors have criticized this process, however, 
maintaining that it is not independent enough. And police shootings have 
triggered numerous wrongful-death lawsuits, some of which have resulted in 
large settlements to the plaintiffs, even when there were no official findings 
of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, law enforcement officials say, state law allows police to shoot 
someone in self-defense, or to protect others when the officer has a 
well-founded belief that the threat of injury or death is immediate. If so, 
officers can use all the force necessary to end the danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, police may shoot at fleeing felons as long as the suspect, armed or 
not, presents a danger to the public or has committed a violent crime, such as 
murder, rape, robbery or mayhem.

AUTHOR DILLARD JOINS FRAY OVER CENSORED TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid a growing dispute over censorship, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Annie 
Dillard on Thursday ridiculed state education officials for pulling a sample of 
her work from a statewide English test. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Board of Education last December deleted an excerpt from Dillard's 
"An American Childhood" from the test being given this month to 10th-graders in 
public schools. Kathryn Dronenburg, a board member from El Cajon, said the 
passage was removed from the test because of "violence" in the description of a 
snowball fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Eastern kids threw snowballs," Dillard said in a prepared statement issued 
on the eve of today's board hearing to review the controversy over the deletion 
of Dillard's story and two works by fellow Pulitzer Prize-winner Alice Walker. 
</P>

 "We even threw snowballs at moving cars. It wasn't very smart of us, but it 
was great fun. It's comical that the censoring conservatives in California find 
the notion of throwing snowballs corrupting," she said in the statement 
released by her New York publicist.

 Dillard's "American Childhood" is the story of her girlhood and adolescence. 
She won the 1975 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction for "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek," a

<P>
 The censorship flap stems from two separate incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, a Riverside newspaper printed a passage from Walker's "Roselily" 
along with questions about it from last year's test. State Department of 
Education officials said they deleted the excerpt because it had been the 
subject of protests from Christian fundamentalists and because the 
confidentiality of the test had been compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action, the Board of Education last December approved the 1994 
test, known as the California Learning Assessment System. But the board, on the 
recommendation of Dronenburg and board President Marion McDowell, vetoed the 
Dillard excerpt and another Walker story, entitled "Am I Blue?"

HAYDEN DECLARES CANDIDACY FOR GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing outside a cafe made famous by a federal corruption investigation, 
state Sen. Tom Hayden on Thursday formally declared his candidacy for the 
Democratic gubernatorial nomination on a platform of "renewal through reform." 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise move a month ago, the Santa Monica lawmaker said he would seek 
his party's nomination in the June 7 primary unless the other Democratic 
candidates, Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, 
embraced his political reform agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Hayden said that Brown and Garamendi have failed to publicly 
champion the reform cause, so it's up to him to raise the issue of undue 
influence by special interests at the Capitol. The winner of the Democratic 
primary is expected to face Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden made his announcement outside Pennisi's Cafe, located a few blocks from 
the Capitol, where former Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier) was secretly 
videotaped in June, 1988, receiving a $3,000 check from an undercover FBI agent 
in exchange for his help on a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said that videotaped breakfast meeting "was not an isolated case but 
part of a larger pattern of activity" that has prompted convictions in an 
ongoing federal political corruption probe. Montoya was convicted of corruption 
charges and is serving a six-year federal prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The same cafe was the site of a 1987 meeting at which then-Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Van Nuys) demanded an illegal payment from a San Diego hotel developer. 
Robbins subsequently was convicted of corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, 54, was a leader in the anti-war and civil rights protest movements of 
the 1960s. He served in the state Assembly for a decade before his 1992 Senate 
victory.

EX-CONSUMER AGENCY HEAD TO RUN FOR INSURANCE POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Conran, who until this week was the director of the California Department 
of Consumer Affairs, announced Thursday that he is running for the Republican 
nomination for state insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Conran served as director of the department for three years before stepping 
down.As director, he supervised an undercover investigation into fraudulent 
automobile repair work by Sears. The investigation resulted in Sears paying an 
$8-million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Conran, 41, who lives in Orinda, will face Assemblyman Chuck Quackenbush 
(R-Cupertino) and Wes Bannister, the owner of a Huntington Beach insurance 
firm, in the GOP primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his major priorities include continuing workers' compensation 
insurance reform -- including looking at rates and competitiveness -- and 
cracking down on medical and workers' compensation insurance fraud that he said 
costs consumers and businesses millions of dollars every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Conran also pledged to fight to keep insurance rates low by promoting consumer 
choice in a more competitive marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) 
are seeking the Democratic nomination for state insurance commissioner.

SOME OF THE KEY PLAYERS IN CANYON OAKS ESTATES DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nearly 16-year battle over what was ultimately called the Canyon Oaks 
Estates drew dozens, perhaps hundreds, into the political fray: from ex-hippie 
homeowners to union construction workers; from wildlife activists to Walt 
Disney's daughter. Here are a few of the players who shaped the discourse and 
helped fashion the surprise deal that may preserve as open space the 257-acre 
property and more than 400 surrounding acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Edelman, county supervisor: After taking a tour of the property Tuesday 
afternoon, Edelman asked the property owners to negotiate the possible sale of 
the land to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. Edelman had been to Summit 
Valley before, but said he was especially moved by his latest visit. "I was so 
struck by the beauty of the place, I decided we had to try one last thing to 
save it," he said of the last-minute talks. "It's a win-win situation." During 
his two decades in office, Edelman has been an unflagging supporter of 
conservation causes, including opposing the development of Canyon Oaks in all 
its incarnations. Although his stands on land issues have earned him some vocal 
detractors, Edelman was reelected by 75% of voters four years ago. He is 
retiring at the end of this term next December and says he is considering a 
university teaching job or a return to practicing law. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy: As 
the 14-year head of the conservancy, the baritone Edmiston was the state 
agency's main negotiator. He has called the Summit Valley area of Topanga 
Canyon one of the most significant wildlife niches in the Santa Monica 
Mountains, and he has tried to acquire part of the land for the conservancy 
before. The Canyon Oaks deal would be the latest in a string of successes for 
Edmiston, who recently masterminded the acquisition of Jordan Ranch in Ventura 
County from entertainer Bob Hope and the donation of Barbra Streisand's 24-acre 
Malibu Estate. Despite tight budgets for public land purchases, he has been 
able to cobble together deals that brought 20,000 acres into the fold of 
protected land in the Santa Monicas. The Canyon Oaks deal, though, was in a way 
the most thrilling, Edmiston said. "With the project minutes away from possibly 
being approved, this is certainly the most dramatic announcement we've ever 
made," he said. "It's one of the better examples that, even in curmudgeonly 
middle age, don't let cynicism get you down because people in adverse 
circumstances can come together and have victory for all sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Wilson, president, Topanga Oaks Inc.: Though rarely seen at hearings 
or public relations events involving the Canyon Oaks Estates proposal, in the 
back rooms Wilson was the project's leader and the one who made the decision to 
negotiate with the conservancy. He said he made the choice to forgo potential 
profits from the development based on a desire to settle the rancorous issue. 
"Let's work together to make this happen," he told opponents of the project 
after the deal was made. Wilson took over control of the project from Sharon 
Lund, Walt Disney's daughter, who died last year. The 50-year-old Glendale 
resident also is vice president of administration of the company set up on 
behalf of Disney's heirs, called Retlaw Enterprises Inc. (Retlaw is Walter 
spelled backward). He has worked for the company for 25 years. Despite the 
decision to offer the land to the conservancy, Wilson said he still believes 
Canyon Oaks Estates would have benefited the area. "We still feel it's an 
excellent project and one that is environmentally sensitive," he said. "And if 
the conservancy is not able to conclude the transaction, we will ask the Board 
of Supervisors to approve it as proposed." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Petrulas Nissman, chairwoman, Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community 
(TASC): Unaware of the late-night deal, Nissman led dozens of placard-bearing 
opponents of Canyon Oaks to the Los Angeles Civic Center Thursday morning to 
try to sway the supervisors against the development. "I keep crying," she said 
after learning about the conservancy deal. "They're the happiest tears since my 
children were born." As she has done in the past, Nissman on Thursday took her 
children, now 10 and 13 years old, out of school so they could accompany her to 
the protest. "My husband and I looked at this as a lesson in civic 
responsibility and government," she said. In 1977, Nissman moved to a Topanga 
Canyon home just over a mile from the proposed development site. Soon 
afterward, she joined the community group TASC, which had been founded by 
architect and longtime Topanga resident Bob Bates in 1963 to preserve the 
canyon's woodsy feel. Nissman became the group's chairwoman three years ago. 
The two agree that the skirmishes over Canyon Oaks have been some the toughest 
in three decades of battling development. "It's been one continuous war for 30 
years, and this is the culmination of our efforts," Bates said. "And what a 
beautiful ending."

RESEARCHERS TO REVISE PATIENT CONSENT PROCEDURE; SCIENCE: FOLLOWING A REPRIMAND 
FROM A FEDERAL AGENCY, UCLA PSYCHIATRISTS WILL INCREASE THEIR WRITTEN 
EXPLANATIONS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA TEST RISKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 UCLA researchers studying a schizophrenia drug are revising their procedures 
for informing patients about potential risks from the studies and are 
increasing oversight of the research after they were chastised by a National 
Institutes of Health committee, university officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A draft of the NIH report also found no evidence that the clinical treatment 
of the subjects in the experiment was inappropriate and that the study's design 
was "scientifically and ethically justifiable," said UCLA clinical psychologist 
Keith M. Nuechterlein, co-leader of the study with Dr. Michael Gitlin.  
</P>
<P>
 The NIH review was prompted by complaints from the families of Antonio 
Lamadrid and Greg Aller, who charge that both suffered severe relapses when the 
drug was withdrawn from them during the study to determine whether patients 
could maintain improvements without medication -- thereby avoiding the drug's 
potentially serious side effects. Lamadrid committed suicide (he was no longer 
enrolled in the program at the time), and Aller threatened to kill his parents 
and planned to travel to Washington to assassinate then-President George Bush, 
he said, at the order of space aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 C. Kumar Patel, vice chancellor of research at UCLA, said the university has 
conducted the study responsibly. "We take very seriously our responsibility to 
people who volunteer to participate in research studies, and have fully 
cooperated with (NIH) over the past three years in continually reviewing and 
enhancing the informed-consent process in this study," said Patel.  
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Aller, Greg's father, angrily denounced the report as a "whitewash. 
NIH didn't talk to one single patient or one single family (other than the 
Allers and the Lamadrids)," he said in an interview. "They talked to us because 
we complained, but they didn't get hold of anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Lamadrid's brother Enrique, a Spanish professor at the University of New 
Mexico in Albuquerque, told The Times he was gratified that the NIH report said 
that "they should have acted, should have done more" to prevent Antonio's 
suicide. "There are things there that prove to me that I was right in making 
the complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lamadrid family has also filed a wrongful-death suit against UCLA because 
of the suicide, Enrique Lamadrid said. 
</P>
<P>
 NIH officials would not discuss the case or the report Thursday "because it is 
still under investigation," according to a spokesman for the National Institute 
of Mental Health, which funded the research. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft, issued by NIH's Office of Protection From Research Risks, was 
distributed this week to UCLA and the families involved, and both groups have 
30 days to respond before a final report is prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 The report does not discuss any potential punishment of the UCLA researchers. 
"Historically, that office has seen its mission as educational rather than 
regulatory," said George Annas, a lawyer and ethicist at Boston University. 
"They want to teach people how to do things right rather than sanction them for 
doing things wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gary Tischler, chairman of UCLA's psychiatry department, said the 
university would not object to the report's conclusions. "We're very 
comfortable with its recommendations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tischler and Nuechterlein said that the informed-consent papers signed by 
patients upon enrollment in the study have been revised once and are being 
revised again to incorporate more information about the study and its potential 
side effects. Much information that had previously been given to patients 
orally will now be written, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tischler also said that the university would add a patient to the 16-member 
review board that oversees experiments on psychiatrically impaired patients. It 
will also establish one or more independent review boards to monitor studies 
where the researchers also provide clinical care for the subjects being 
studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside reaction to the report was mixed. Annas, for one, thinks the UCLA 
study was poorly designed and that treatment of the subjects whose medication 
was withdrawn should have been resumed before symptoms reached a severe stage. 
"You could bring them close to relapse, then start treating them again. The 
arguments about what could be learned (by withdrawing medication) are secondary 
to the potential for damage to the patients," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schizophrenia is a severely disabling illness affecting more than 1.2 million 
Americans and is characterized by delusions, hallucinations and severe 
disorders in thought processes. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern about virtually all antipsychotic drugs -- including Prolixin, 
which was used in the UCLA study -- is that they have severe side effects. 
Prolixin and other drugs can cause a permanent movement disorder called tardive 
dyskinesia. Gitlin and Nuechterlein's hope was that patients could be weaned 
from the drug to reduce the likelihood of such outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuechterlein and UCLA officials argued forcefully that patients withdrawn from 
the drug were monitored very carefully for the return of symptoms and that the 
researchers were prepared to restore treatment when it became necessary. "When 
it's needed, medication is given and that overrides any research need," 
Tischler said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aller and other parents have argued that they and the subjects were not 
adequately warned about the severity of the potential relapse. Robert Aller 
also charges that he and his wife "practically begged" the team to restore 
treatment to Greg Aller, but that their request was refused until it was too 
late. (Greg Aller is now under private care and his condition is much better, 
according to his parents.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Nuechterlein said that when the medication was withdrawn, "we . . . tried 
to make the best decision we could with the information we had." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that no suicides occurred during the study among patients whose 
medication was withdrawn. Enrique Lamadrid confirmed that his brother was no 
longer enrolled in the study when he committed suicide.

SANTA MONICA FREEWAY COULD REOPEN IN MAY; TRANSPORTATION: ROUND-THE-CLOCK WORK 
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK PUSHES REPAIRS TO THE EXPRESSWAY MORE THAN A MONTH AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Heralding good news for thousands of commuters, state transportation officials 
announced Thursday that repair work on collapsed sections of the Santa Monica 
Freeway is moving ahead so quickly that the roadway will be opened to traffic 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
 By working around the clock, seven days a week, the contractors who are 
repairing the world's busiest expressway have pushed work more than a month 
ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway, which normally carries 341,000 cars a day, was closed at two 
points after sections of the elevated roadway collapsed at La Cienega and 
Washington boulevards during the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials set a June 24 deadline for completion of the repairs, but 
offered the contractors incentives for finishing early. They will get a bonus 
of $200,000 a day if they beat the deadline, but will be penalized by the same 
amount for each day beyond the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 If the work is done 30 days ahead of time, the contractors will receive an 
extra $6 million on the $15-million contract. But state and company officials 
say that some of the bonus will be eaten up by the expense of paying crews to 
work extra hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Roberts, chief engineer at Caltrans, said records show that C.C. Myers 
Co., the firm rebuilding the Santa Monica Freeway, has completed 30% of the 
work, while only 20% of the time on the contract has elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's way ahead," Roberts said. "We expect to see that freeway open in May." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 quake damaged freeways in 200 locations. Seventy-eight bridges 
suffered moderate to major damage. Six bridges collapsed, causing closures and 
major detours. 
</P>
<P>
 For commuters, the crippled Santa Monica Freeway has forced traffic onto 
crowded surface streets between Santa Monica and Downtown Los Angeles. 
Typically, the detours have resulted in delays of 20 minutes or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs on four other freeway failures in the north end of the San Fernando 
Valley are also well ahead of schedule, Roberts said. The total repair bill 
will be about $100 million, he said. Incentives to finish early range from a 
high of $200,000 a day to $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Bauer, vice president of C.C. Myers, estimated that the company will 
complete its work about 40 days ahead of schedule, or by mid-May. Clinton C. 
Myers, company president, said he expects to finish the job even earlier, by 
the beginning of May. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ahead of our projected schedule and we hope to continue to accelerate 
and pick up more time," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said that the speedy work does not mean a reduction in quality and that 
the company will cut no corners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job is being built to the highest standards," he said. "There is nothing 
that's temporary or any design criteria . . . being disregarded." 
</P>
<P>
 Although 200 workers are now on the job and two of the crews are already 
working 12-hour shifts, Bauer said he hoped to increase the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said they selected C.C. Myers because the firm was the 
lowest bidder and has a good track record. The company worked on the recently 
opened Century Freeway and the new upper deck of the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Loma Prieta earthquake, the firm was hired to reconstruct two 
quake-damaged bridges on California 1 at Watsonville. Given 100 days to 
complete the job, the company finished 40 days early, Bauer said, despite 
difficulties posed by the weather and terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Bauer said, work on the Santa Monica Freeway has been easier, 
even though it suffered two short setbacks.  
</P>
<P>
 First, workers unexpectedly encountered some old foundations that had to be 
removed. Then they found contaminated underground water, which had to be 
disposed of in accordance with strict state regulations. Myers estimated that 
those problems set the job back about 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had some bad luck," Myers said. Even so, he said, "there's no doubt 
we'll make it in less than 100 days." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments affecting the county's freeways, state transportation 
officials Thursday announced plans by Gov. Pete Wilson to accelerate a program 
of reinforcing 1,000 freeway bridges statewide that have been identified by 
state engineers as seismically unsafe. About 40% are in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Wilson signed an emergency measure speeding retrofit work on fewer 
than 100 unsafe bridges in the county that were damaged by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the comprehensive program announced by Dean R. Dunphy, secretary of the 
state Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, calls for legislation that 
will cut red tape and accelerate work on all unsafe bridges, assuring 
retrofitting of all by 1995. An additional 1,500 bridges across the state are 
being screened for a final time to determine whether any of them also will need 
reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 A comprehensive engineering analysis of bridges in 1992 by Caltrans identified 
716 in Los Angeles County that needed retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported last month that only 115 so far have been strengthened, or 
about 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 10 bridges rated the most hazardous in the county, six have not been 
retrofitted, including some of the county's busiest freeway junctures, such as 
the intersection of the Ventura and the Golden State freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said that strengthening of the junction should be finished within a 
year if the governor's plan is adopted by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest repair job ahead is reconstruction of the collapsed intersection 
of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways, which fell during the quake, 
killing a motorcycle patrol officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Demolition work is far ahead of schedule and almost completed, Roberts said. 
But extensive reconstruction will not be finished until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Freeway should be repaired by mid-May, Roberts said. The Gavin 
Canyon bridge over the Golden State freeway should be done by mid-June.

MISSING FEMA INSPECTOR IS FOUND ASLEEP IN RENTAL CAR; SEARCH: ROBERT FRANCIS 
FISHER HAD DISAPPEARED 10 DAYS AGO. POLICE SAY THERE ARE INDICATIONS HE HAD 
BEEN USING COCAINE IN RECENT DAYS.

<P>
 Missing FEMA Inspector Robert Francis Fisher was found Thursday after an 
exhaustive search, and those looking for him -- especially the Los Angeles 
Police Department -- are none too happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, 39, who raised fears in his brother and police when he disappeared 10 
days ago, was found sleeping in a rental car parked near his Sepulveda 
Boulevard motel before dawn. "There are indications Mr. Fisher had been using 
cocaine in recent days," Los Angeles Police Lt. Gene Brummell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was down the street the whole time," said a relieved but angry Rodney 
Fisher, 31, who had been going door-to-door in search of his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Francis Fisher, an Oakland construction inspector working on a FEMA 
contract checking buildings for earthquake damage, was last seen by colleagues 
on Tuesday evening of last week as he headed for his room at the Comfort Inn at 
8647 Sepulveda Blvd. in North Hills. When he had not been seen or heard from 
for several days, his brother -- also a FEMA contract inspector from Oakland -- 
brought in the LAPD's Missing Persons Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives ran down leads, checked the morgue, as many of the 250 or so local 
hospitals as they could, and even County-USC Medical Center to see if Fisher 
had shown up dead or injured as an unidentified John Doe. His brother, Rodney, 
and others combed the neighborhoods where Fisher had been working, asking 
residents if they had seen him. 
</P>
<P>
 A patrol officer found Fisher about 2:50 a.m., when the officer stopped to 
talk to some women standing on a street corner near Fisher's motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he asked the girls out there on the corner, they said: 'Yeah, he's right 
over there. We know exactly who you're talking about.' They took him straight 
to him," Rodney Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He either was or had been under the influence of coke," said Detective 
Raynette Sincosky of the missing persons unit. 
</P>
<P>
 When police brought the wayward inspector back to his motel room, his brother 
asked Fisher what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had nothing to say," Rodney Fisher said. "He just looked at me. He was 
ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Fisher said he put his brother on the first plane back to Oakland on 
Thursday morning. But first, he took him to the FEMA contractor's office to 
apologize, and drop off his FEMA-issued cellular phone and portable computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached in Oakland, Fisher acknowledged he had been missing without notifying 
anyone "for a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked about the police report of cocaine use, he said: "I'd rather 
get back to you on that." He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Rodney Fisher, Sincosky said she too had spent an awful lot of time 
looking for Fisher, and was worried about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really didn't have friends down here that we're aware of, and no criminal 
history," Sincosky said. "And luckily for him, he still doesn't. He probably 
doesn't have a job though." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hall, Fisher's boss at Suncoast Associates Inc. of Edmonds, Wash., which 
employs both Fishers, had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed, for all the problems he put me through and my friends 
through," Rodney Fisher said. "I'm happy he's safe and he's back, but I'm 
disappointed in him."

GUN CONTROL ADVOCATE PRAISES ROBERTI; POLITICS: SARAH BRADY MAKES APPEARANCES 
FOR EMBATTLED STATE SENATOR, WHO IS FACING RECALL CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nationally known gun control advocate Sarah Brady swept into Los Angeles on 
Thursday to throw her support behind embattled state Sen. David A. Roberti, who 
is fighting a recall effort being staged by what he calls "assault weapon 
extremists."  
</P>
<P>
 Brady, the wife of former White House Press Secretary James Brady, who was 
badly injured in a 1981 assassination attempt against President Reagan, was the 
big attraction at both a news conference for Roberti and later at a 
$250-a-plate fund-raising dinner attended by about 350 people at the Biltmore 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's our hero," Brady said at a news conference of the Van Nuys-based 
Democrat who faces an April 12 recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, who heads Handgun Control Inc., the national organization that took the 
lead recently in winning passage of a federal gun control law, praised Roberti 
for what she called his courage in authoring a 1989 California ban on 
military-style semiautomatic weapons, often loosely dubbed assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, who put in an appearance at the news conference via a satellite feed 
from Sacramento where he was attending to earthquake legislation, has 
complained that the recall is the work of a small band of gun-rights advocates 
who are trying to punish him for his 1989 law. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a question, Roberti said that it was not the Religious Right 
out to get him but "more the survivalist and the Aryan rights" groups.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time Brady appeared on behalf of Roberti, his foes stepped up 
their efforts to broaden the appeal of their campaign to recall the senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents released by Kevin Washburn, an attorney who has been a leader in 
efforts to pass the "three strikes and you're out" initiative and heads the 
pro-recall forces, cited newspaper reports of Roberti's support for former 
California Supreme Court Chief Justice Rose Bird and his personal antipathy of 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's initiative was seen as an attempt by Roberti's foes to shed the 
image that they are -- as Roberti has repeatedly asserted -- exclusively 
composed of gun-rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 While the movement has been heavily influenced by Second Amendment 
enthusiasts, the anti-Roberti coalition also includes groups that are critical 
of the senator's soft-on-crime stands, according to Washburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper accounts distributed by Washburn on Thursday showed that in the 
mid-1980s as conservative groups attacked Bird for delaying enforcement of the 
death penalty, Roberti predicted that the chief justice would win reelection 
and "end up looking like Joan of Arc." Roberti also praised the Bird-led 
Supreme Court as a "strong, meaningful, stand-tall court," according to 
newspaper stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti campaign press secretary Staci Walters said that while Roberti 
personally opposes the death penalty, "he has repeatedly voted for laws to 
expand capital punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady's appearance Thursday is likely to continue to strengthen Roberti's 
efforts to elevate his recall fight into a statewide, if not a national, 
crusade against gun enthusiasts that can reap political dividends down the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady's group has already supplied Roberti with a mailing list of its more 
than 100,000 California members, which Roberti is using to solicit campaign 
fieldworkers and money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next several weeks, James Brady will make an appearance of his own in 
California on behalf of Roberti. It is also expected that the Brady 
organization will assist Roberti in tapping into the Hollywood community for 
more star-power, according to Roberti advisers. One possibility being discussed 
is having Hollywood celebrities walk precincts for Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Roberti's political advisers are privately hoping that turning the 
recall into a high-profile election will help propel the senator to higher 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti is expected to announce today that he will enter the Democratic 
primary for state treasurer. He has also filed to run for a Los Angeles-based 
Board of Equalization seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti said Thursday that he doesn't care if his own political career is 
swamped by the recall if it "means we have saved the life of one single child" 
by helping take assault weapons off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue is bigger than me," he said at the Thursday morning news 
conference outside County-USC Hospital featuring four doctors who decried the 
many gunshot wounds they treat daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gail Anderson, head of the hospital's emergency services department, said 
the hospital treats 1,500 gunshot patients annually. Anderson and Dr. Glen 
Rogers argued that stricter gun control laws are needed to reduce the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers was one of three operating room physicians who were shot during a wild 
melee at County-USC Hospital on Feb. 9, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night, Roberti held a fund-raiser for his "Beat the Recall" campaign 
at the Biltmore Hotel. About 25 members of the the Coalition to Restore 
Governmental Integrity, made up of groups supporting the recall, picketed 
outside to commemorate victims who have suffered because of Roberti and his 
soft-on-crime philosophy, said Russ Howard, one of the recall's top 
strategists. 
</P>
<P>
 Washburn told reporters that his background in the victims rights movement 
nationwide would be used to combat the recall movement's image as the work 
solely of firearms enthusiasts. Washburn has taught classes on victims' rights, 
for the U.S. Department of Justice, to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on board to begin talking about victims' rights and the failed leadership 
of David Roberti," Washburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, actor Beau Bridges, who played Jim Brady in a TV movie about Brady's 
shooting, told reporters that Sarah Brady's energy and commitment had drawn him 
into the gun control movement.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; SOAP OPERA FORUM FOCUSES ON CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can soap operas save the world? 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a medium to reach people deeply and emotionally," Gloria Carlin, 
an actress who played Charity Gatlin on "General Hospital," said at a forum in 
North Hollywood on the power of daytime drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum -- held at the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences theater on 
Lankershim Boulevard Wednesday night and titled "Can Soaps Save the World?" -- 
focused on the educational use of television to change social attitudes through 
characters and plot lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's discussion focused on how some soap operas in Mexico, India and 
Venezuela are seeking to change attitudes on reproduction, the empowerment of 
women and other social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Panelists also included David Poindexter, president of Population 
Communications International, and Cecile Guidote Alvarez, a representative from 
Balintatow Theatre Television Productions, a Venezuelan soap opera series 
production company. It was moderated by actress Jeanne Cooper, who plays 
Catherine Chancellor on "The Young and the Restless." 
</P>
<P>
 Executive producer Roger Pereria talked about how he created 'Humraahi," a 
52-episode Indian soap opera designed to educate the Indian people on 
overpopulation. One of the main characters was a young woman who was being 
pressured into pregnancy by her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the year 2000, India will have 1 billion people," said Pereria of the 
current birthrate in his country. "A girl must not be forced into marrying 
until she is ready for it. Unless there is significant attitude change in this 
area, achieving a lower birthrate is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing research done by his own company, Pereria said the series, which is 
preparing for its second season, created a small but strong change in attitude 
among its viewers. Fewer viewers accepted the premise that a girl should marry 
and have children early, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ratings are not yet in on the overall effectiveness of such 
educational programming in soap operas, audience members said a lot can be 
learned from these pioneering efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, there are millions of people in the world who believe that if we do 
not use media carefully, we will not survive," said Miguel Sabido, a Mexican 
television executive and one of the panelists featured in the discussion. JEFF

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; EVENTS TO COINCIDE WITH WORLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Civic boosters hope to kick Glendale into the spotlight with a myriad 
marketing and sports activities planned around World Cup soccer finals in 
Pasadena in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup provides an opportunity for Glendale's business and 
entertainment venues to capture the attention of thousands who will visit 
Southern California to attend the event, city administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among activities scheduled to coincide with the games is a dribbling contest 
entitled "I Get My Kicks in Glendale." The June 11 event will feature 300 to 
600 people kicking a soccer ball around an 18-mile course, said Nello Iacono, 
director of parks, recreation and community services. 
</P>
<P>
 Each participant will be required to kick the ball up to two-tenths of a mile 
around the course -- set to start in Kenneth Village and culminate in a food 
fair at Verdugo Park. Fees for the event are $7.50 for youths and $10 for 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been chosen by Legacy Tour to host soccer skills competitions 
April 9 at Verdugo Park. The event, which is open to the public, will challenge 
soccer enthusiasts to dribble, pass and shoot the ball, Iacono said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are also developing a proposal for two evening festivities, centered 
around a Harley-Davidson/surfing theme and a country-Western barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 These events, scheduled to brought before the City Council for approval in 
April, will be held during soccer finals in June, said Robert McFall, assistant 
city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 These activities are designed not only to promote Glendale, but to capitalize 
on soccer's increasing popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer is as large as baseball at our parks at both the organized and 
unorganized level," Iacono said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted this week to appropriate $7,500 to hire the public 
relations firm Roland & Associates to develop an agenda for World Cup 
activities in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency is also being asked to allocate $7,500 in promotional 
monies. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm will coordinate activities with World Cup USA, design promotional 
materials and implement a "full-service" media campaign, McFall said. JENNIFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; NEW SEPULVEDA BLVD. CRACKDOWN IS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city should extend its recent crackdown on Sepulveda Boulevard businesses 
to include all 24-hour restaurants, liquor stores and other businesses that are 
magnets for crime, community leaders said this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The call by Don Schultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn., and 
neighborhood watch activist Romana Catton to target the businesses marks the 
first time residents have called on city leaders to focus on all-night 
establishments. "With any 24-hour operations that cannot convincingly 
discourage loitering and congregating during late hours and early morning 
hours, police and city departments should review and discontinue those 24-hour 
operations," Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not anti-business," Catton added. "It's nice to have a 24-hour gas 
station available. But in an area with so much crime, you don't need anything 
open like a doughnut shop or a burger shop or a Laundromat. These are just a 
place for prostitutes and drug dealers to loiter and do their business." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Catton and Schultz have testified at public hearings or written letters 
to the city to complain about businesses that lure crime to their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz and Catton want the city Zoning Department or City Council to identify 
and investigate all 24-hour operations along Sepulveda Boulevard as possible 
magnets for crime. Those that are determined to have a high crime rate should 
have their hours reduced and possibly be required to hire security, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a precedent, Schultz cited the city Zoning Department's crackdown last week 
on five Sepulveda Boulevard motels. As part of an investigation initiated by 
City Councilman Marvin Braude to eliminate prostitution that surrounds these 
locations, the owners of all five were told to hire security or risk closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Catton and Schultz also cited a recent investigation into Orville's Originals 
doughnut shop on Sepulveda Boulevard, a 24-hour operation considered a public 
nuisance by police. 
</P>
<P>
 But both community leaders exercised caution while calling for such a probe of 
the 24-hour shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you only go after places that serve alcohol, you are discriminating," 
Schultz said. At the same time, he added, "I don't think this applies to the 
Kinko's Copies on Sepulveda." JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; LAWYER HAS LARGEST CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of seven candidates running for three open San Fernando City Council seats, 
newcomer Arthur M. Kay, a lawyer, has by far the largest election campaign 
fund, reporting $17,000 in total contributions received. 
</P>
<P>
 According to campaign disclosure statements filed last week, all of Kay's 
money came from his law firm, Law Offices of Arthur Kay. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Godinez, an engineer with the Los Angeles Department of Public Works, had 
the second largest war chest, with $3,436, and incumbent Doude Wysbeek had the 
third largest, with $1,760. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Baltierrez reported $1,526 in contributions, incumbents Jose Hernandez 
and Dan Acuna reported $1,350 and $350, respectively, and John Becker reported 
a campaign budget of $0. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Ed Guzman failed to submit his campaign statement on March 3, and 
had still not done so by Thursday afternoon. He is being fined $10 per day 
until he does, said City Clerk Wilma Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 The early statements, which cover the period from Jan. 1 to Feb. 26, do not 
necessarily represent who has the most financial backing. Some candidates, such 
as Mayor Acuna, held fund-raisers after the March 3 deadline for the 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates are required to file another financial disclosure form March 31, 
which will update their overall campaign contributions. That statement will 
cover the period from Feb. 27 to March 26. 
</P>
<P>
 If a candidate fails to submit a statement, the case is handed over to the 
city attorney for further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The election will be April 12. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE, BURBANK; 5-CITY COALITION SEEKS BIKEWAYS 
MASTER PLAN 
</P>

<P>
 In a few years, Glendale residents may be able to ride to Pasadena 
unencumbered by traffic, noise or diesel fumes. Not in a car, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo Verdugo Transportation Coalition members are hoping to connect the 
coalition's five member cities -- Burbank, Glendale, South Pasadena, Pasadena 
and La Canada Flintridge -- with a series of bicycle paths. 
</P>
<P>
 To expand its vision of commuting on two wheels instead of four, the coalition 
formed a bikeways task force, which is charged with combining the bikeways 
master plans of each city into a regionwide system, said Steve Adams, Glendale 
assistant city manager. The coalition contracts with Glendale to use Adams as 
its staff planner. 
</P>
<P>
 The bikeways task force submitted a letter of intent to the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments last week to be considered for a $100,000 grant 
to draft a regional bikeways plan, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bikeways master plan would study how to connect bike paths slated in 
cities throughout the region -- most of which have yet to be built, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also propose means to combine bicycle facilities, and determine 
methods to convince drivers that biking isn't only for recreation, but is a 
convenient, and maybe quicker, way to get to work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale does not have a bikeways master plan, but plans to hire a consultant 
later this year to create one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arroyo Verdugo Transportation Coalition, formerly the Tri-Cities 
Transportation Coalition, works to promote regional mobility, and coordinate 
and plan transportation systems on a regional basis. JENNIFER OLDHAM

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: POWER TOOLS DONATED TO L.A. FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For firefighters, the collapse of the Northridge Meadows Apartments tested not 
just mettle but hardware as well. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latter that was found lacking, said Capt. Craig Morrison of the Los 
Angeles Fire Department's Urban Search and Rescue Team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the confined space, the heavy gas-powered tools used to break through the 
floor to reach victims spewed fumes, and were deafeningly noisy. Rescuers had 
to wrestle with unwieldy saws to free human bodies from the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 So for Morrison, it was sheer good fortune when Makita U.S.A., the La 
Mirada-based tool distributor, announced it was interested in donating to the 
cause of earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The company quickly dispensed with the idea of sending money, said Makita 
Senior Vice President Pat Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the firm invited rescue officials to go catalogue shopping, leafing 
through the firm's list of products to find exactly what they wished they had 
in Northridge on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? Morrison found himself looking over $20,000 worth of new 
state-of-the-art electric power tools in a donation ceremony at Fire Department 
offices in Sherman Oaks on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Northridge Meadows, there wasn't enough room to work with the traditional 
tools. We made do with what we had -- with hand saws and stuff like that," 
Morrison said. The new, electric-powered tools are quieter, pollution-free and 
easier to handle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have more finesse with tools. In Northridge, we were cutting wooden 
structural materials right off of people. I mean, for that, you really need 
something precise," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Makita's gift included two 3,500-watt generators, circular saws, reciprocating 
saws and a chain saw. Makita has also offered to provide servicing and training 
to the Fire Department. JILL LEOVY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE TO BRING BACK SUMMER CURRICULUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to boost flagging revenues and student confidence, Pierce College 
will return to its full summer curriculum this year. But the college plans to 
cut several classes from the following spring and fall semesters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when we didn't offer full summer school last summer, a lot of 
students became very concerned," said William Norlund, vice president of 
academic affairs at Pierce. "Some were thinking we weren't even going to be 
around for them to get a two-year degree, which was ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 Beset by a budget crisis last spring, Pierce College administrators canceled 
the 150-course summer school. They decided at the last minute, however, to 
offer 40 summer classes because of pressure from students. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the decision to shrink the summer program might have cost the 
school even more, as enrollment stayed low in the fall, Norlund said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the students may have decided to go elsewhere during the summer and 
just stayed," Norlund said. Like other community colleges, Pierce receives 
funds based on the number of students in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce will probably trim 100 of its 1,800 fall semester classes and 150 of 
its spring classes next year to help offset the cost of summer school, Norlund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we're going to have a lean fall schedule," Pierce President 
Lowell Erickson said. "And the students will hopefully go into classes that are 
being offered and therefore raise the average class size a little. There are a 
lot of classes that aren't completely filled." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the areas very likely to be cut include courses in the humanities, 
philosophy, arts and social sciences that often have small enrollments, Norlund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer program offers mostly the popular general education classes in 
areas such as English, math, chemistry, biology and psychology. KURT PITZER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT REORGANIZING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Community College District announced Thursday that it is 
reorganizing its administration -- effectively cutting three positions -- in an 
effort to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Fausto Capobianco said that within the district's Educational 
Services Division, the positions of director of student services and director 
of instructional programs have been consolidated into a new position called 
senior director of educational services. 
</P>
<P>
 That post has been filled by Victoria Munoz Richart, former vice president of 
academic affairs at Mission College in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 The directorship of student services has been vacant for several months, 
Capobianco said. 
</P>
<P>
 An administrative analyst position in the office of the president of Mission 
College has also been cut and the person who held the position reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Also slashed was the position of executive assistant to the district 
chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosalind Goddard, who vacates that position, will become acting associate dean 
of administrative services at Southwest College in Los Angeles. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CLERK PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO EMBEZZLING 
</P>

<P>
 A clerk who worked in Calabasas Municipal Court pleaded not guilty Thursday to 
charges of embezzling more than $2,400 that had been paid by traffic violators 
and those filing small claims lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Zulma Rodriguez is free on her own recognizance after being charged with three 
felony charges, including embezzlement of public monies and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David Sotelo asked a judge Thursday to set bail at $50,000, 
saying Rodriguez had given two weeks' notice at her job and indicated she was 
planning to move to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities began an investigation of Rodriguez, a 31-year-old woman who also 
uses the name Troche Zulma, when a man reported in December that he received 
collection notices after paying $92 in cash to settle two tickets, according to 
Sotelo. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators with the Municipal Court and the district attorney's Bureau of 
Investigation have determined the court is missing $2,455.44. Investigators are 
still trying to determine whether any other funds are involved, Sotelo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez worked at customer windows at the courthouse and received payments 
for traffic tickets and small claims filing fees. She also provided translation 
services for Spanish speakers, Sotelo said. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing was set for March 22. THOM MROZEK

DEFENDANT SAYS HIS WIFE TREATED HIM 'LIKE A SLAVE'; COURT: MOOSA HANOUKAI 
TESTIFIES HE KILLED HER IN A FIT OF RAGE. HE TELLS THE COURT SHE FORCED HIM TO 
SLEEP ON THE FLOOR OF THEIR WOODLAND HILLS HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sobbing throughout his testimony, a man who admittedly killed his wife in a 
fit of rage told a Superior Court jury Thursday that his wife had abused him 
emotionally and treated him "like a slave" during much of their 25-year 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Moosa Hanoukai, 55, faces a prison sentence of 15 years to life if a jury 
convicts him of second-degree murder for beating his wife to death with a 
wrench in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Through tears, Hanoukai testified Thursday that he did not object to being 
forced to sleep on the floor of the couple's Woodland Hills home because his 
wife intimidated him. "She would start arguing, cursing, cursing my mother and 
father," Hanoukai said in Farsi, translated by an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by defense attorney James E. Blatt why he did not buy his own bed, 
Hanoukai responded sobbing, "she wouldn't let me." 
</P>
<P>
 While Blatt has acknowledged that his client is a killer, he has argued that 
Hanoukai should be convicted of manslaughter instead of murder because he was 
the cowed victim of years of intense abuse by a wife who controlled almost 
every aspect of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Blatt is presenting a "cultural defense," in which he hopes to 
convince the jury that Manijeh Hanoukai continually challenged his client's 
manhood, a violation of the family's Iranian-Jewish culture in which males are 
dominant. Divorce, Blatt said, would have brought shame to the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a dark blue prison jumpsuit and rarely raising his eyes as he 
testified, Hanoukai, an Iranian immigrant, testified that he endured a marriage 
in which he was constantly being ordered around and was the frequent target of 
his wife's vitriolic attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 'do this,' 'do that,' 'don't do that,' 'sleep here,' 'don't sleep 
here,"' Hanoukai said in Farsi, bursting into tears and resting his head on his 
arms. "I became her slave." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai testified that after his brother-in-law criticized his spending 
habits for buying a deck of playing cards in 1978, Hanoukai turned the couple's 
clothing business over to his wife to avoid confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 After the family came to the United States in 1982, they bought a home in 
Woodland Hills and opened a women's clothing store in Huntington Park. Almost 
immediately, Hanoukai said, his wife began forcing him to sleep on the floor 
and prohibited him from spending any money. Hanoukai told the court he even had 
to ask her for money to buy cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever it was she was telling me, I would obey," he testified. "I didn't 
make any personal decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Hanoukai said, would call him stupid in front of others. " 'Shut 
up,' she would say. 'You're garbage. You're filth. You're nothing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai said that one day while his mother-in-law was visiting, his wife told 
him, "I kicked you out of the bedroom and I'll kick you out of the house," at 
which her mother began laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai's testimony will continue today .

PROSECUTORS TARGET 2 SUSPECTS FOR 1ST '3-STRIKES' CASES IN VALLEY; CRIME: SCOTT 
MCKISSICK, CHARGED WITH DRUG POSSESSION, AND LEON BLUNT, HELD IN CAR THEFT, ARE 
BOTH EX-CONVICTS.

<P>
 In the first "three-strikes" cases in the San Fernando Valley, authorities 
Thursday picked a man shot while allegedly trying to steal a car at El Camino 
Real High School, and a second man arrested on suspicion of drug possession who 
was stopped for not wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Because both defendants have two prior convictions, each faces 25 years to 
life in prison under the new "three-strikes-and-you're-out" law that went into 
effect Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not exactly the type of case I envisioned crossing my desk," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert L. Cohen, who filed the drug case. "However, we are 
here to enforce the law as it is written." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant, Scott McKissick, a 33-year-old Chatsworth man, was charged with 
possessing .08 of a gram of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a usable quantity," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKissick pleaded not guilty Thursday in Van Nuys Municipal Court and was 
ordered held in lieu of $100,000 bail. He was arrested Tuesday afternoon after 
Los Angeles police officers saw him walking in Van Nuys "in a slow, deliberate, 
slumped manner," Cohen said. McKissick entered a car and police stopped it when 
they saw McKissick was not wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
 He was initially arrested on charges of being under the influence, but 
officers later found a glass vial containing suspected drugs, according to 
Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 McKissick was convicted of armed robbery in 1981 and armed residential 
burglary in 1986, authorities said, but no further details were available. 
</P>
<P>
 If McKissick had no record, the case probably would have been filed as a 
misdemeanor, Cohen said, and he would likely have been placed in a drug 
diversion program instead of being sent to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second case, to be filed today in Van Nuys Municipal Court, Leon Blunt 
will be charged with assault on a police officer for allegedly attempting to 
run over a Los Angeles Unified School District police officer at Reseda High 
School on Wednesday, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Blunt, a 38-year-old Los Angeles man on parole from an auto 
theft conviction, has an extensive criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was prepared late Thursday afternoon by Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry 
Diamond, who said the criminal complaint will allege that Blunt was previously 
convicted of robbery, attempted robbery and auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
 After allegedly stealing a car, Blunt and a second man were seen cruising the 
parking lot at El Camino High on Wednesday, Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Aaron Mengazzi saw the two allegedly breaking into a student's vehicle 
and approached, but Blunt allegedly attempted to run over the officer with the 
car, "coming within a foot of him," Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mengazzi dodged the car and shot, hitting Blunt in the leg, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt was arrested without further incident.

MOTORIST SETTLES CIVIL LAWSUIT AGAINST JACK NICHOLSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles man who sued actor Jack Nicholson for allegedly using a golf 
club to smash the windshield of his Mercedes-Benz during a traffic dispute has 
settled a lawsuit against the movie star, an attorney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Scott Blank of Hollywood accused the Oscar-winning actor in a lawsuit 
filed last month in Los Angeles Superior Court of shattering his windshield and 
causing him to fear for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 8 incident began at a Studio City intersection when Nicholson got out 
of his car stopped at a red light and repeatedly struck the roof and windshield 
of Blank's car because he believed Blank had cut him off in traffic, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A settlement was reached in the civil case, according to Tina Levy, a 
secretary for Charles E. Ruben, the attorney representing Blank, who declined 
to return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy said she could not elaborate on the details of the settlement, including 
the day it took place. However, according to court records, the lawsuit was 
dismissed March 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson, whose film credits include "A Few Good Men," "Hoffa" and "The 
Shining," still faces criminal charges stemming from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city attorney's office filed a complaint against the 
57-year-old actor earlier this month charging him with one count of vandalism 
and one count of assault. He is scheduled to be arraigned March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles English, an attorney representing Nicholson, declined to comment on 
whether the settlement of the civil case would affect the outcome of the 
criminal charges filed against his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent accusations that his golf swing was employed on the wrong side 
of the law, Nicholson is scheduled to serve as celebrity host of the 23rd 
Police-Celebrity Golf Tournament. Funds raised at the May 14 event will benefit 
the families of slain, sick or injured officers.

TRIAL DATE SET FOR SUIT OVER PLAYBOY BAN AT FIRE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge set a trial date for a lawsuit filed by a Los Angeles County 
fire captain against his department over a ban on Playboy and other adult 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Department Capt. Steve W. Johnson, with the backing of the 
American Civil Liberties Union and Playboy, filed a lawsuit last December in 
Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that his First Amendment rights are being 
abridged by a policy that prevents him from reading what he wants at his 
Antelope Valley fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 County fire officials issued a sexual harassment policy in July, 1992, banning 
sexually oriented publications from all work locations, including dormitories, 
restrooms and lockers. The policy was designed to prevent a sexually charged 
environment in fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson decided Thursday to let a jury 
resolve the issue and set a June 7 trial date. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be a precedent-setting case that will provide 
guidelines in the workplace," Johnson said during a telephone interview 
Thursday. "We need sexual harassment guidelines without giving up our 
constitutional rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Les Tolnai, a senior deputy for the Los Angeles County counsel, who is 
representing the Fire Department in the lawsuit, said the department enacted 
the rule to prevent female firefighters from filing sexual harassment claims 
caused by hostile work environments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire stations provide minimal privacy," Tolnai said. "So reading publications 
with nude photographs is the same as displaying nude photographs, which would 
create a hostile work environment."

DRIVER KILLED AND 4 HURT AS CAR CROSSES ROAD AND HITS 3 VEHICLES

 A Castaic man may have fallen asleep behind the wheel when he drove his car 
over a divider on Soledad Canyon Road in Santa Clarita on Thursday, killing 
himself and injuring four others, a sheriff's deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43-year-old driver, who police declined to identify pending notification 
of his family, was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital and later 
pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 6 a.m. near Greenbrier Mobile Home Park when the 
man, who was traveling east, drove over a raised concrete divider and 
sideswiped an oncoming pickup truck, which slid into eastbound traffic and 
overturned, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Clint Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car continued traveling against traffic and collided with a minivan, then 
crashed into another pickup truck and stopped in the middle of the road. The 
drivers of the second pickup and the minivan lost control and drove into the 
bushes, Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might have fallen asleep," Bowers said of the car's driver. "The road is 
straight and there was no reason for him to make a turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no indication that he lost control or there was mechanical failure 
or erratic driving prior to the collision," he said. "He drove over it 
gradually. It looked like it was a lane change." 
</P>
<P>
 Those injured were treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital and 
released, except Vernon Bean, 70, of Canyon Country, who was driving the second 
pickup. He suffered broken legs and was admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated accident near Castaic, a truck trailer delivering newspapers 
spilled diesel fuel after it rear-ended another truck, forcing the California 
Highway Patrol to close three northbound lanes of the Golden State Freeway 
south of Osito Canyon Road, a CHP spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the first truck) went across four lanes of traffic, struck the center 
divider and went through it," CHP Officer Wendy Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to rest on the other side of the highway, about 50 to 60 gallons 
of fuel had spilled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second trailer overturned and dumped pallets of cardboard onto the road; 
its detachable truck came to rest on the highway's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the 4:45 a.m. accident.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CAMPUS SMOKING BAN MAY BE EXPANDED; HEALTH: 
PRACTICE IS ALREADY BANNED IN OFFICES AND CLASSROOMS, BUT COLLEGE OF THE 
CANYONS TRUSTEES GIVE INITIAL OK TO STRICTER REQUIREMENTS.

<P>
 The ban on smoking at the College of the Canyons may be expanded to include 
the outdoor sports stadium, uncovered stairwells and a 20-foot area surrounding 
campus doorways. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking is already banned in offices and classrooms, but college trustees 
Wednesday gave initial approval to the stricter requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, what we've done is taken smoking out of classrooms and out of 
hallways and put it outside," Trustee Bruce Fortine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ban also applies to formal campus events held outside, such as a 
recent cultural arts festival or the weekly farmers' market. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban will come up for a final vote April 20. If approved, it would take 
effect immediately, according to college public information officer Sue Bozman. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean you can't smoke in the parking lot," Bozman said. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials have been discussing smoking prohibitions since November. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the college standpoint, we're concerned with the health issue," Fortine 
said. "There was a feeling by the board that a (complete) no-smoking policy 
would be too restrictive." 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking has been prohibited for more than six months at all indoor and outdoor 
facilities and events involving Santa Clarita's public high schools and junior 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees at the William S. Hart Union High School District expanded their 
restrictions to outdoor events in August to qualify for $30,000 a year in 
federal Tobacco Use and Prevention Education funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city has been considering a smoking ban that would prohibit 
smoking in restaurants, workplaces and enclosed public areas. Commercial 
businesses such as banks, malls, theaters and Laundromats are also covered. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the ordinance in December, but changed direction a 
month later when nearly 200 people packed City Hall. Restaurant owners said 
their customers would be driven into nearby unincorporated areas where no ban 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more public hearings will be held to discuss Santa Clarita's tobacco 
control ordinance before it is voted upon. Those meetings have been delayed by 
the Jan. 17 earthquake and its battering of City Hall.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BOARD OKS NEW SECONDARY SCHOOL BOUNDARIES IN

 Now that the shouting is over, about 1,200 to 1,400 incoming students will 
attend different junior and senior high schools beginning in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Capping months of controversy, William S. Hart Union High School District 
trustees voted unanimously Wednesday night to adopt new boundaries, reflecting 
the opening of Valencia High School and La Mesa Junior High School this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan applies to incoming seventh-, ninth- and 10th-graders, and will 
expand in consecutive years to cover higher grades. Current sophomores, juniors 
and seniors are not affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Dividing the district's 11,000-plus students among four high schools and four 
junior highs has been controversial because new schools aren't located so 
children from an elementary school or neighborhood can be shifted as a group to 
a nearby site. 
</P>
<P>
 The school districts' limited finances mean that they cannot purchase ideal 
property for campuses, and must rely upon voter-approved bonds or developer 
agreements to secure land wherever they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two new schools are in the wrong places, basically," Trustee Patricia 
Hanrion said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents have said they'd prefer their children going to a crowded 
neighborhood school rather than being bused to a different site. However, the 
district has to shift students to use the new campuses and relieve chronic 
crowding. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they never built another home, you'd need to have more capacity at the 
junior high and senior high because there are so many students at the 
elementary level," said Lew White, district facilities director. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier proposals caused some parents to blast other neighborhoods. Most 
notably, some Saugus parents complained about their children attending junior 
high school in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are stuck with it, and what we're trying to do is meet your desires and 
comply with the law," Trustee John Hassel told a group of more than 130 parents 
at the board meeting. "What I'm impressed with is people have moved past the 
complaint stage and are trying to cure the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The newly adopted boundary plan includes "priority" options, which will allow 
students assigned to distant schools to have priority to transfer back to a 
closer campus if enrollment allows. Students not addressed under the priority 
system may still request a transfer under open enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan calls for: 
</P>
<P>
 * Upper Bouquet Canyon area elementary school students -- once designated to 
attend Sierra Vista Junior High School in Canyon Country -- will attend Arroyo 
Seco Junior High in Saugus. When the elementary school in the Plum Canyon area 
opens -- estimated in the fall of 1996 -- students in those neighborhoods would 
attend Sierra Vista and later Canyon High School, but will have the priority 
option to attend Saugus High School. Any tract homes in Plum Canyon sold after 
April 1 will go to Sierra Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 * Students now at Meadows and Old Orchard elementary schools in Valencia who 
live north and west of McBean Parkway and east of Rockwell Canyon Road will 
attend La Mesa Junior High in Canyon Country. They will have the priority 
option to transfer to Placerita Junior High School in Newhall. Current 
ninth-graders from the Meadows and Old Orchard attendance area will remain at 
Hart High School rather than go to Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
 * Youths living near Arroyo Seco Junior High, including the Northbridge 
housing tract, will attend that school. Anyone moving into a new home there 
will attend La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 * High school students in the Bouquet Canyon area are slated to go to Valencia 
High, but have the priority option to remain at Saugus High.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY VOTES TO AMEND GENERAL PLAN TO INCLUDE 
PARKS, TRAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parks, playgrounds and hiking trails are now officially among the priorities 
for the future of this high desert city. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the City Council voted unanimously to amend the city's General 
Plan to include the parks, recreation and trails element, which serves as a 
long-term blueprint for the city's recreational needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides providing for playgrounds and other recreation areas, the element 
includes a vast network of walking and biking trails that will eventually link 
with other trails throughout northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Jim Ledford said passing the amendment was an important step. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of those foundation blocks -- that once you've got it, you've got 
something very special." 
</P>
<P>
 Implementation of the various projects will be in step with the planned 
50-year implementation of the overall General Plan, said principal planner 
Laurie Lile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we're going to go out and start building next week -- parks are 
built as they're needed," Lile said. "But we are trying to ensure that the 
community has these things for a better quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the element, which was nearly a year in the making, improves the 
city's chances of getting funding for some of the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to get grants when you've got a plan," she said. "And now we've 
got it in black and white." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Pluss, who served on the citizens panel that helped draft the element, 
said there is a very basic need for some of the projects contained in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no safe place to walk and ride now," the self-proclaimed "middle-age 
bicyclist" told the council during a plea to pass the amendment. "There will be 
if this is activated." SCOTT GLOVER

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY TO SEEK FEMA FUNDS FOR COWBOY POETRY 
FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT GLOVER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are asking the federal government for $13,000 to help pay for 
the relocation of an upcoming festival that was displaced by the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay $15,000 to hold next month's Cowboy Poetry, Music and Film 
Festival at the historic Melody Ranch Motion Picture Studio in Newhall. The 
event was originally slated for the William S. Hart High School auditorium at a 
cost of $2,000, but had to be moved after the auditorium was severely damaged 
in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is applying to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for funds to 
cover the difference. But some residents are questioning the legitimacy of 
asking FEMA to help pay for the new venue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just outrageous," said Deborah Luck, a Canyon Country resident. 
"Those funds are supposed to be for people who still don't have a roof over 
their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 City spokeswoman Gail Foy said city officials would be remiss in their duties 
if they did not ask for assistance. If FEMA does not pick up the tab for the 
new location, the additional expense would come out of the city's general fund, 
Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at this as an additional legitimate expense caused as a result of the 
earthquake," Foy said. "We ask for anything that we can possibly ask for, but 
that doesn't mean we're going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 She defended moving the three-day festival, which begins March 25, to the 
famous movie ranch, saying alternatives would have cost the city more. She said 
holding the event in a tent with the necessary acoustic properties would cost 
$27,000, and that canceling the festival would result in the loss of between 
$30,000 and $40,000 in advances paid to entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way, we're planning to break even," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Luck, who has unsuccessfully lobbied the city to install street lights on 
a stretch of Soledad Canyon Road where a woman was recently murdered, said the 
city should not be spending money on the festival at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inappropriate," she said. "I can tell you we need a lot of things in 
this town a lot more than we need a cowboy poetry festival."

FAMILIES MOURN LOVED ONES KILLED IN CRASH; TRAGEDY: FIVE OF THE 12 DEAD HAVE

 Fifty-seven-year-old Juana Basilia Alfaro worried about her daughter's safety 
ever since that big earthquake in January, so she left her home in El Salvador 
for the long journey to Los Angeles to make sure her Silvia was safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite by chance, she joined other immigrants who had crossed the border near 
Nogales, Ariz., on Tuesday afternoon. She squeezed herself with 19 others 
inside a pickup truck that had parked along a rural highway. The group had 
pooled their money and offered the driver $600 for overnight passage to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At sunrise the next morning, as the truck traveled past Barstow, the driver 
apparently fell asleep at the wheel. The vehicle drifted off Interstate 15 and 
smashed into an earthen drainage culvert. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 20 people crammed inside the pickup, 12 were killed. The other eight -- 
including the driver -- were injured. One of the fatalities carried the address 
of Alfaro's daughter in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the San Bernardino County coroner's office, Silvia Guadalupe 
Alfaro of Los Angeles made the dreaded drive Thursday morning and confirmed her 
worst fears: Her mother was one of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Juana Basilia Alfaro had been unsuccessful in getting a visitor's visa 
during several trips to the U.S. Consulate, she apparently decided to make the 
trek north without immigration documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was coming because she loved me, to take care of me," Silvia told 
KVEA-TV outside the morgue. She had not seen her mother in several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Silvia spent the rest of the day with a psychologist. And 2,000 miles away, a 
country recovering from a dozen years of bloody civil war -- a conflict that 
sent 1 million of its people fleeing north -- mourned the loss of some of its 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a national tragedy in El Salvador," said Gerardo Sol Mixco, the 
consul general for El Salvador in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As the day grew longer, family after family drove up to the bunker-like 
coroner's office in San Bernardino. In communal embraces, in tears and in 
whispers, one by one, families went inside to face death. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, the bodies of four Salvadorans had been identified by 
relatives. Sol Mixco said they were Alfaro; Aida Hernandez, 34; Gloria Alicia 
Barrientos, 36, and Heber Noe Penate, 26.  
</P>
<P>
 The body of a fifth person, a Guatemalan, also had been identified, Sol Mixco 
said, although he did not know the name. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the tragic ride were offered Thursday by Jose Rosales, 20, whose 
survival was characterized as a miracle by his physician at San Bernardino 
County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosales said he and the other travel-weary immigrants, most from El Salvador, 
happened to fall into step as a group earlier this week. They walked across the 
border and came upon the man with a pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men joined the driver in the front seat, and a woman sat in the lap of the 
man closest to the passenger door. In the bed of the truck, under a camper 
shell, the other 16 travelers hunkered down for the last leg of their journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosales said he could recall little about the crash Wednesday morning, which 
occurred after 12 hours on the road. When he awoke on the hard desert floor, he 
tried to wake up the person lying next to him. He soon realized the person was 
dead. Then Rosales passed out again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to better my life," he said, eyes wet with emotion as a knot of 
reporters crowded around his hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
 His left leg, right ankle and collarbone were broken, and his jaw was scarred. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dev Gnanadev said the young man would probably make a full recovery, 
although his immediate future was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Los Angeles said 
the survivors would be interviewed about their immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 INS investigators have not yet interviewed the driver because he remains in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Tom Gorman contributed to this story. McDonnell reported 
from San Bernardino and Nazario from Los Angeles.

MIKE DOWNEY: KINGS ARE A STUDY IN INEPTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I went to a hockey game Wednesday night, but could not recognize the home 
team. What a dreadful and painful experience it was, watching what has become 
of the Los Angeles Kings, a good bunch of guys and a once-upon-a-time good 
team. They rolled over and played dead like dogs during the game, then hid like 
mice when it was over. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a team in need of a heart transplant, this "team of fat cats," as 
Coach Barry Melrose dutifully blistered them after a 4-0 defeat to Chicago that 
revealed the Kings at their lousiest, laziest worst. I left the Forum sorry for 
whatever economic hardship owner Bruce McNall might or might not be having, 
because this truly was a night when every man, woman and child in Inglewood 
deserved a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans were hard on the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Melrose said, "The fans were too kind to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he was even harder on the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about making the playoffs and we haven't got one player who wants to 
make the playoffs," the coach said, seething. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess those Anthony Robbins courses haven't helped. 
</P>
<P>
 The only real reason to attend a King game these days is to pay respects to 
King Wayne himself, the deserving Wayne Gretzky, as he waits and waits and 
waits for a shot at breaking Gordie Howe's goal record so he can get out of the 
limelight and on with his life. I have to give Gretzky all the credit in the 
world for all of his quiet candor -- he agreed with every word Melrose said -- 
and the gentle stabs at good humor he made after hearing his own teammates 
booed at the Forum as though they were all in town visiting from Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky said, "There's absolutely no reason and no excuse for not being sharp 
and not being ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky included Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not doing anything, either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again he drew a blank against Ed Belfour, the goalie from Chicago who has 
never let one Gretzky-shot puck past him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was with all the effort he could muster, I thought, that Gretz got a 
crooked smile on his face and said that Belfour wasn't the only one who had 
kept him from scoring in his career -- that, in an exhibition once, writer 
George Plimpton had denied him, too. I have no idea when this was, however, 
since my only published record of Plimpton on ice is when Boston once used him 
in goal against Philadelphia and he stopped Reggie Leach on a penalty shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, comedy tomorrow, tragedy tonight at the Forum, where sadness now rules. 
The Kings have quit. Their power play is a joke. Their speed and hustle have 
vanished. Their inadequacies abound. During their first 20 minutes against 
Belfour, they peppered him with all of seven shots. He could have ordered a 
submarine sandwich from Subway and eaten half of it before anybody from the 
Kings came near his crease. The Blackhawks could have used six skaters and 
given Belfour tickets to go see Jay Leno. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third period, the Kings took six shots, none by Gretzky. Somebody leave 
a wake-up call for Gordie Howe for 1995. There isn't much time before the '94 
playoffs, which the Kings should enjoy greatly on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose, no fun to be around any more, said, "We're a terrible team. There are 
no excuses. If anybody says there are, it's bull . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky, not much fun himself at the moment, said, "He's probably right. The 
talent we have is a lot better than the situation we're in. Consequently, 
(Melrose's) respect for the hockey club is dwindling." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised the coach said what he said? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm surprised he didn't say it sooner," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose, once full of wit and mischief, is mad as hell and not going to take 
much more of this. Gretzky, always docile but rarely down in the dumps, looks 
wrung out and sounds sadder than sad. McNall, once the Tommy Lasorda of merry 
hosts, is unhappily enduring the most stressful year of his public life. The 
hockey team that once gave all three heartfelt joy is giving them nothing but 
heartburn now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings have become bums. 
</P>
<P>
 No, that's being too kind to them.

A TRAGEDY REVISITED; TIM CREWS' WIFE LAURIE IS STILL ASKING WHY A YEAR AFTER 
THE FATAL BOATING ACCIDENT.; FRIENDS AND FAMILY ASKED SAME ABOUT HER 
ENGAGEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a boat being pulled from the still water of Little Lake Nellie, not 
far from the dock where Tim Crews and Steve Olin were killed last spring. That 
dock, once thought to be too long, is on dry land now. The lake is down this 
year and the shore is about 75 feet away.  
</P>
<P>
 The first time Laurie Crews walked from her house to see where her husband's 
boat had rammed that dock was the day of his funeral. She walked alongside Kirk 
Gibson and Bobby Ojeda, and they spent time talking, trying to make some sense 
out of it. But she knows now it can never make sense, especially to her three 
small children. Still, they try. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say what if -- what if the water was lower and it hadn't been such a 
wet season, what if Timmy wasn't with the Cleveland Indians and living so close 
to camp, what if we wouldn't have had the picnic that day . . . ?" Laurie said 
Tuesday, tears welling in her eyes. "But I have to think that if it's your 
time, then it's your time. I guess, it was Timmy's." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been times that Laurie Crews yelled out the window at her husband, 
angry that he would take a chance and go boating in the dark. It was about an 
hour after sundown last March 22 when Crews, 31, Olin, 27, and Ojeda got into 
Crews' 18-foot Skeeter bass boat to do some fishing. Olin, Ojeda and their 
families had driven from the Indians' spring training camp in Winter Haven to 
spend the day on the Crews' new 45-acre ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had played with my toys and gone (horseback) riding, then the guys had 
played on the tractor, and then Timmy wanted to show off his toy, his boat," 
Laurie said. "I asked him not to go, saying, 'Don't you think it's getting too 
dark?' But that didn't do much good. Timmy even spent 45 minutes getting the 
water pump to work . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 It was cloudy, the last overcast night Laurie remembers from that spring, and 
there are no street lights in this rural area of Central Florida. Perry 
Brigmond, a family friend, arrived late and drove his truck to the shore, 
flashing his lights to let Tim know he was there. Tim turned the boat toward 
home to pick him up, pushing the throttle to 39 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The nose of the boat rose when he gunned it, and when it came down, it had 
slammed into the end of the 185-foot wooden dock that juts out from a 
neighbor's back yard. The boat hit the dock head-level, decapitating Olin and 
killing him instantly. Part of Ojeda's scalp was torn off, but he was saved 
through surgery. Crews was taken to an Orlando hospital, where he died 10 hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went running down to the lake and it was so dark that I ran into a 
chain-link fence," Laurie said. "The paramedics were there, and Tim was already 
on a stretcher, so I ran further and I saw Bobby out of the boat, then I looked 
in the boat and saw Steve. . . . And I remember the paramedic telling me that 
Tim was being airlifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in the hospital room, I had this feeling that Timmy was trying to 
decide whether he should leave or stay. He would get bad, then he would get 
better, then he would get bad again. I think he was trying to decide if he 
should come back and be part of a person, if he could do that. But if Timmy 
couldn't do it perfect, he couldn't do it. He would have been miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are friends and relatives of Laurie Crews who still have trouble driving 
up the narrow clay road that leads to the top of Autumn Lane, where Laurie and 
Tim built their dream house, a large two-story country home set against a 
backdrop of rolling green pasture. They had moved in only six weeks before the 
accident, and after, many of Laurie's friends told her she should move out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't think I should be here, in this big house by myself with three 
kids, with the lake right here and all," Laurie says. "But I couldn't leave 
here. I wasn't even unpacked when it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Suitcases remain in the upstairs recreation room, still packed with Tim's 
spring training clothes. Boxes of photographs and memorabilia of his six years 
with the Dodgers are nearby, below the walls where one day Laurie will hang 
them. And outside is the dock that claimed her husband's life. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two months after the accident remain a blur to Laurie. She remembers 
trying to explain it to her children, Trisha, 10, Shawn 5, and Travis, 3. She 
remembers not being able to get out of bed and feed the kids; then the first 
day she was able to. She says it was her children who made her pull herself 
together. She also had a ranch to put together. There were fences to build and 
horses to tend to. She remembers it all as being very spooky. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie and Patti Olin, Steve's wife, spoke frequently during that time by 
telephone. They had met the day of the accident, and had vowed to stay 
connected for life. Patti also had three children, two babies and a 3-year old. 
Together they stood at Cleveland Stadium for a special ceremony on opening day, 
an extremely emotional time. But when Laurie was brought to Dodger Stadium to 
attend that opener, she said it was devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Crews had been with the Dodger organization since the winter of 1986, when 
he was traded by the Milwaukee Brewers for Greg Brock. He played for the 
Dodgers some of 1987 and most of 1988, then became an effective middle-relief 
pitcher. The Dodgers did not pick up his or Ojeda's contract after the 1992 
season, however, and both signed with Cleveland. One of the few photographs 
that Laurie has been able to display is the one taken on Family Day during the 
1992 season. It is the last family photograph and shows all five Crewses 
dressed in Dodger uniforms.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tim being gone a lot, that wasn't easy," Laurie says. "I used to always tell 
my girlfriends that I would trade my life for theirs, and they would say, 
great. But I would have loved to be in my house every day and know that Tim was 
going to come through the door after work and we would have dinner together, 
rather than eating alone. Obviously, the money is nice and I wouldn't change 
anything, but we looked forward to such a day when we could just sit here and 
have a normal life." 
</P>
<P>
 The scars on Laurie's heart are far from healed. She can talk about the 
accident almost in the third person, but she can't say much about her and Tim 
without breaking into tears. What's more, she says, most everything she has 
done the last year has met with disapproval of those closest to her.  
</P>
<P>
 The boat she bought recently raised some eyebrows, and when she sold Tim's 
truck, that became a problem for some. Friends thought she should have taken 
the children to counseling and were amazed that she hasn't sought therapy for 
herself. But nothing has driven a wedge between her and her friends more than 
her relationship with 24-year-old Sean Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after Tim died, Laurie met Griffith, who was building fences for 
her on the ranch. They became close quickly, Griffith moving in shortly after 
they met. Now, they are engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie says the news was greeted with disdain by most of her close friends and 
relatives, who questioned how she could be dating so soon. She said Ojeda, who 
had invited Laurie to Cleveland to witness his comeback, reneged on the 
invitation when she said she wanted to bring Griffith. She and Patti Olin quit 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted Sean with me in Cleveland for emotional support," Laurie said. "What 
people don't realize is that with them isolating themselves from me, who did I 
have? I had Sean and the kids, and that brought us closer together. Staying 
away was probably the worst thing they could do.  
</P>
<P>
 "I understand it was hard for everybody because it happened so fast, but I 
didn't plan it. People think I'm replacing Timmy, but no one can ever take 
Timmy's place, not in my mind or in my kids' minds. We spent 15 years together, 
and we were married for 13. When I thought of growing old, I never thought I 
would be without Timmy." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie says friends are worried that Griffith, who is nine years younger than 
she, is after her money. Financially, Laurie is very comfortable, thanks to 
Tim's baseball pension and an insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to sell everything and go live in a shack to see if he's for 
real," Laurie said. "Sean is good with the kids, and he's not taking Timmy's 
place. The kids like him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I look at it is, there are two sides to a tunnel, a dark side and a 
light side. Bobby, Patti and I all started out in the middle because it was a 
tragic thing. You can choose which way you want to go, and I wasn't going down 
the dark end. It's very easy to put yourself in a grieving situation, where you 
look at photo albums or put on music that reminds you of Tim or sit down and 
have too many drinks. But where do you think you are going to go, upward? No 
way. I wasn't going that way.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it had just been me, it would be easy to be just depressed. But I had 
three kids who depended on me, I had people coming to work for me and they 
depended on me to have a job for them. Everybody deals with things their own 
way. I'm sorry if mine has been easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all have turned their backs on Laurie. Some say they have tried to call 
her but that she hasn't responded. Many of her friends from Tim's days with the 
Dodgers have been in touch, including the wives of Jay Howell, Brett Butler and 
Dennis Cook. Tim Belcher has tried to reach her. So has Dave Anderson's wife, 
Gina. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda, who delivered a eulogy at Tim's funeral, called to 
congratulate her when he heard she had a boyfriend. "Tell him to take care of 
my kids," Lasorda said.  
</P>
<P>
 And recently, Patti Olin called. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody still expects me to be Tim's wife, but he's not here anymore and 
people have a hard time accepting that," she said. "Just because I have Sean 
doesn't mean I don't grieve. It used to be that there is a certain period for 
mourning. Well, mourning for me is always. It's not like it's been a year and I 
can stop mourning now. I don't think I will ever get over it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's late afternoon at the Bass & Bridle, as Tim and Laurie named their ranch, 
and the children are home from school. Little Travis has been there all along, 
quietly watching "Dennis the Menace" on television in the other room. But 
Travis soon comes and tugs at Laurie, wanting to know why his show has suddenly 
disappeared. He doesn't understand where Dennis went. He doesn't understand 
that the show is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Trisha recently went on a trip with some friends and talked about some things 
that were bothering her. Later, Laurie spent some time working through those 
things with her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were other things after the accident that Trisha had to deal with. 
At school, she heard her dad had been drunk when he drove the boat. Crews' 
blood-alcohol content of .14 exceeded the legal limit of .10 for driving a 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to Trisha, 'You were there that day, and you saw your daddy. Do you 
think he was drunk?' " Laurie said. "He drank beer and a swig of vodka on the 
boat. But there was never a question of not wanting him to go boating because I 
thought he was drunk. That never crossed my mind. I didn't want him to go 
because it was dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Trisha sits down at the dining-room table to do her homework, and Laurie 
spends time helping her before walking the visitor down to the lake. On the 
way, she stops at the barn, introducing her six horses in addition to the 15 
others Laurie boards there. Her dog, Stetson, is sleeping under a horse trailer 
with a couple of the cats. Her other dogs are playing in the lake and hunting 
through the brush on the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two weeks before the accident, a friend of mine and I were talking 
philosophically, and she asked me what I would do if I ever lost a child," 
Laurie says. "I told her I would probably go into the insane asylum. Then we 
took it further and said, what if we lost our husbands? And we decided, same 
thing, we would probably get committed. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you never know what you are going to do. You never know how you are going 
to react. You have to walk in somebody's shoes before you make judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has their own way of dealing with things."

SKIING / WORLD CUP AT MAMMOTH; SCHNEIDER RUNS AWAY WITH A MILESTONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More amazing than Vreni Schneider's 50th World Cup victory Thursday, a slalom 
that the Swiss star led from start gate to finish, was her contemplation of 
retirement at 29. 
</P>
<P>
 She's some has-been. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider dropped some hints after winning her sixth World Cup slalom of the 
season and moving past Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg into the World Cup overall lead 
heading into next week's finals at Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider left the drama to the also-rans, posting the fastest times for both 
runs to win with a total time of 1 minute 18.52 seconds. Katja Koren of 
Slovenia was a distant second, 1.43 seconds behind, and Germany's Martina Ertl 
finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Island's Carrie Sheinberg was the top American, posting a career-best 
11th place. She said watching Schneider race is like attending a clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must be something she does that we don't," Sheinberg said. "Because she 
beats us by a lot. I really don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement? 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider is skiing down the back slope of perhaps her best season. She is 
coming off an Olympics at which she won three medals -- gold, silver and bronze 
-- to add to the two gold medals she won at the 1988 Calgary Games. 
</P>
<P>
 She has won more medals -- five -- than any other female skier. 
</P>
<P>
 She is within striking distance of Annemarie Moser-Proell's record of 62 World 
Cup women's victories.  
</P>
<P>
 After Schneider's Mammoth victory, Swiss coaches and teammates presented her 
with a gray sweatshirt with "50 Times" printed in blue block letters across the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider appears to shock herself with each achievement. She might be shocked 
again next week at Vail, where she may very well clinch the second overall 
title of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking up 100 points with her latest triumph, Schneider overtook Wiberg in 
the overall standings and leads by 41 points. Wiberg finished fourth Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, now the World Cup overall is on my mind," Schneider said. "Then, 
I'll go home and, in the quiet of my home, make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said her chances of returning next year are 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
 Another number, 62, might enter into her decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, 62 is something to shoot for," Schneider said of Moser-Proell's 
record. "But I think it's too many wins for me to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 American expectations are more modest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheinberg is trying to pick up the slalom slack left when Julie Parisien, a 
three-time World Cup winner, announced that she was taking a sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
 After a disappointing season through December, the 21-year-old Sheinberg 
gained momentum into the Olympics, where she placed a surprising 18th in 
slalom, the best U.S. finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheinberg had the 14th-fastest time in the first run and moved up three 
positions with a second-run time of 39.67, and a two-run total of 1.21:82. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheinberg said her problem has been self-confidence. After her top-20 finish 
in the Olympics, she was asked to give a motivational speech to the basketball 
team at her former high school in Port Washington, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it helped me as much as it helped them," Sheinberg said.

USFSA WON'T STOP HARDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Figure Skating Assn. said Thursday that it will not pursue legal 
action that would prevent Tonya Harding from competing in the March 20-27 World 
Championships in Chiba, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a decision by a federal judge Wednesday in Portland, Ore., which 
granted Harding a temporary restraining order preventing immediate action 
against her, the association said in a statement that it is "deeply concerned 
with the court's ruling and its impact on the USFSA's ability to govern the 
sport . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But the USFSA said that it will not try to have the ruling overturned in the 
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals because of time constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 An attempt by the USFSA to reschedule a disciplinary hearing for Harding 
within 45 days was rejected by Harding's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a Portland newspaper, the Oregonian, reported that U.S. Department 
of Justice and Detroit law enforcement officials will not continue 
investigations into whether Harding played a role in the Jan. 6 assault in 
Detroit against rival Nancy Kerrigan. A Portland grand jury will report its 
findings on March 21, the day Harding is scheduled to skate for the first time 
in Japan. RANDY HARVEY

SOCCER TOUR GETS STARTED AMID UNFULFILLED PROMISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 World Cup officials on Thursday launched the much-publicized Legacy Tour '94 
in ceremonies held next to a pockmarked and muddy field at the Nickerson 
Gardens housing project in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg presided over the unveiling of a small 
"Skills Court" -- a fenced-in area covered with artificial turf topped with 
sand.The unkempt field adjacent to the festivities was supposed to have been 
the site of the World Cup's first Inner-City Soccer Program.  
</P>
<P>
 That field was the scene of another World Cup press conference, held on Nov. 
24, 1992. At that time Rothenberg announced, along with officials of Rebuild 
LA, that the field would be reseeded and refurbished and provided with lights. 
Officials said the work was scheduled to begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen months later, the field remains unimproved. Rothenberg said Thursday 
that it would be upgraded, some time after April 22, when the Legacy Tour 
officially begins.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's coming," Rothenberg said of the work. "The field is played on so much, 
it's tough to get started." 
</P>
<P>
 The ambitious Inner-City Soccer Program had promised to improve soccer 
facilities, supply tickets to national-team games and first-round World Cup 
matches, conduct clinics with national team players in "neglected areas of Los 
Angeles," and conduct training sessions at the U.S. soccer training facility at 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 How many of these goals have been reached is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials have made much of their effort to get urban children 
interested in soccer, a sport with few roots in the black community. The Legacy 
Tour is a national program designed to leave a "legacy" of soccer around the 
country. Some cities will receive the small courts and others will have 
existing soccer fields upgraded.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; TANANA EXPERIMENT NOT GOING VERY WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels hoped they could resurrect the magic, bringing pitcher Frank 
Tanana's arm back to life.  
</P>
<P>
 They still hope that Tanana will be able to rejoin the Angel rotation 14 years 
after he left it, but reality is setting in. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanana, 40, struggled again Thursday in an 8-7 loss to the San Francisco 
Giants, yielding six hits, five walks and four earned runs in 2 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The temptation is to worry, but that would take away from what I'm trying to 
do," Tanana said. "I'm just going to have to pitch my game and show them I have 
the ability to get outs." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen batters have reached base in 4 2/3 innings against Tanana, who has a 
17.36 earned-run average. Tanana was behind nearly every hitter Thursday and 
had poor control of his curve and changeup. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had to come in with his fastball," Manager Buck Rodgers said. "When he 
does that, he can't pitch. He just doesn't have that kind of fastball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels would love to keep Tanana, but are wondering if they would be 
better off with rookie Brian Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanana is expected to be given at least two more starts before the Angels 
reach any conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tanana: "Management knows it's hard to judge the first two or three 
outings. . . . . Of course, when you give up as many runs as I have, that's 
easy to say, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Giant reliever Steve Frey faced his former teammates for the first time since 
his January departure as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would come to this," said Frey, who 
yielded two hits and three earned runs in 2 2/3 innings. "I thought I'd always 
be an Angel." 
</P>
<P>
 Frey wanted to stay with the Angels, but when they refused to tender him a 
contract by the Dec. 20 deadline to avoid arbitration, he became a free agent. 
The Giants wound up winning his services by offering a two-year, $1.83-million 
contract with $150,000 in incentives. The Angels offered a two-year, 
$1.7-million contract. BOB NIGHTENGALE

RIVERSIDE WOMEN BASKETBALL PLAYERS SCUFFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two former UC Riverside women's basketball players were allegedly attacked by 
current team members Tuesday afternoon at a restaurant near the school. Monica 
Vargas, the team's defensive player of the year during the 1992-93 season, 
sustained a concussion as a result of the altercation. 
</P>
<P>
 The former players, Jennifer Newsome, 22, and Vargas, 21, left the Riverside 
basketball program in the past year after disputes with the coach and 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 The women reported the incident to Riverside Police. No charges have been 
filed pending an investigation, which is expected to be completed in a week. 
The police report will then be reviewed by the District Attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director John Masi said the matter had been referred to Vice 
Chancellor Louis Leo. School officials would not identify the players and have 
instructed team members not to go to the restaurant until the matter is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsome and Vargas were treated at the university's health center on 
Wednesday, saying they had been kicked and beaten, causing bruises on their 
bodies and welts on their heads. Vargas complained of headaches and on Thursday 
was referred to Riverside General Hospital, where she was said to have a 
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 According to various accounts, Newsome and Vargas went to the restaurant to 
eat and visit waitress Rachel Rosario, a former UC Riverside All-American 
basketball player. While they were eating, two members of the Riverside team 
came into the restaurant and were joined later by five more players. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's assistant manager said neither the players nor Newsome and 
Vargas acknowledged each other. According to witnesses, Newsome went outside 
and the seven players also left. Vargas left moments later. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, words were exchanged between Vargas and a player. Vargas said she was 
hit and knocked to the ground by one of the players. Newsome said she was 
restrained from coming to Vargas' aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsome said she broke free and attempted to intercede but was also attacked. 
A restaurant employee said he observed Newsome on the ground being struck by 
two players. The fight broke up when a police officer arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside program was the subject of a Times story in October in which 
players were critical of Coach Debbie Woelke and the program. Newsome and 
Vargas were among the most vocal in their criticism. Masi investigated the 
complaints and took no action.

FREMONT COACH CITED AFTER BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY SANDOVAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Fremont High assistant basketball coach was cited by Fresno police for his 
alleged role in a brawl after Tuesday night's Southern Regional Division I 
tournament game between Fremont and host Fresno Bullard. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Houston is accused of hitting Rick Browning, Bullard assistant 
athletic director, who suffered a cut over his eye.Browning needed several 
stitches to close the wound. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when most of the Fremont and Bullard players were shaking 
hands after their first-round playoff game, won by Bullard, 81-60. Three 
technical fouls had been called during the game against Fremont players. 
</P>
<P>
 As fans and players were leaving, Louis Radford, a Fremont player, allegedly 
ran behind referee Pete Caldwell and punched him in the head.  
</P>
<P>
 Bullard administrators tried to restrain Radford after the incident while fans 
and players gathered around him. The crowd began pushing when Fremont players 
and coaches, who said they had not seen the alleged assault, tried to find out 
what happened, Fremont Coach Sam Sullivan said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We came out and two big men had Louis by the throat and waist," Sullivan 
said. "We didn't know what he had done and tried to make them let him go. 
That's when the pushing started." 
</P>
<P>
 Browning was then struck in the face, allegedly by Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno Unified School District officials said they will examine a videotape of 
the disturbance today.  
</P>
<P>
 Radford's status has not been determined, Fremont Principal John Haydel said.

FOR VISITORS, A DEEP HOLE IN THE ROAD; COLLEGE BASEBALL: NORTHRIDGE, WITH 
PSYCHOLOGICAL EDGE OF A WOEFUL FACILITY, HOPES TO PARLAY HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE 
INTO A CONFERENCE TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One national periodical called Cal State Northridge's baseball facility the 
worst in NCAA Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 The outfield wall at Matador Field is made of cinder block. Two different 
colors, no less.  
</P>
<P>
 There's a black high-top tennis shoe sitting on top of the home dugout that's 
been there so long it's starting to crack and fade. 
</P>
<P>
 The home clubhouse looks like a railroad boxcar. In several places, duct tape 
holds what's left of the carpet to the cement floor. There is no carpet in the 
visitors' clubhouse, because there is no visitors' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Hawaii believed the Matadors' home-field advantage was more like a 
mine-field advantage. When the Rainbows showed at Matador Field and looked 
around, the players weren't at all shocked. They figured a bus would be taking 
them to the real field when warm-ups concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked if it was our practice field," Northridge outfielder Jonathan 
Campbell said. "We said, 'Uh, no.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Rainbows weren't exactly enamored of the lumpy field conditions. After the 
series opener, a Hawaii infielder showed the next day wearing a mouthpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he went a little too far," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge pushed Hawaii further and swept the three-game series. But that was 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 If a fourth postseason berth in as many seasons of Division I competition 
awaits, Northridge (9-10) must first take care of business at home. The 
Matadors open Western Athletic Conference West Division play at 2 p.m. today 
with a key series against the conference-favorite Rainbows. 
</P>
<P>
 For obvious seismological reasons, Northridge recently renamed the school gym 
The Epicenter. Suggested change for the baseball field: Decrepicenter. But be 
it ever so humble, there's no place like. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "(Winning at home) is a prerequisite," Coach Bill Kernen said. "You have to do 
the job at home to have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-game series with Hawaii, ranked 24th in the nation by Collegiate 
Baseball, gives Northridge a chance to prove its mettle at the opening gun. 
It's time to get those home fires burning, or the season might be toast. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the way the Matadors struggled during nonconference play, Kernen 
figures the only way the team will qualify for an NCAA regional is by winning 
the overall conference title. The winner receives an automatic NCAA bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances of an at-large bid are slim because Northridge is 1-6 against 
nationally ranked competition, Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its record and ranking, Hawaii (14-6) may be ripe for the picking. The 
Rainbows have yet to play a game on the mainland. Northridge played 17 of its 
first 19 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Northridge finished behind Fresno State in the five-team WAC West 
and the Bulldogs recorded a division-high 10 victories at home. Northridge won 
nine home games -- and finished tied for second with Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen predicts that a record of 15-9 would be good enough to win the title, 
and that the conference race will be so tight, "probably four games will 
separate the top (team) from the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which has won five of its last seven, is a respectable 8-9 on the 
road. Since baseball is the most stat-happy of sports, here's some quick math: 
If the Matadors again win nine WAC home games and continue to play at a .500 
pace on the road over the 24-game conference season, Kernen hits his mark of 
15-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the week, four of five WAC West Division members had winning 
percentages of .500 or better. Hawaii is considered the favorite; no other WAC 
team is ranked nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rainbows are followed by San Diego State (13-6), Cal State Sacramento 
(9-7), Northridge (9-10) and Fresno State (7-11). 
</P>
<P>
 It's a free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't stand head and shoulders above anybody," Kernen said. "And neither 
does anybody else."

HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL / SEASON PREVIEW; MANLET QUIETLY BUILDS WINNER AT SIMI 
VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The middle-aged man threw his arm around Suzanne Manlet and beamed with pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my first shortstop," he bellowed time and again to anyone within 
earshot at the Simi Valley High softball tournament last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Landreth could not hide his admiration. He wanted everyone to know that 
Manlet, the Simi Valley softball coach who has guided the Pioneers to the 
state's top ranking, was his protege. 
</P>
<P>
 Landreth wanted everyone to know that the 14-year-old shortstop he once 
coached in an Oxnard youth league had grown up to be one of the most successful 
softball coaches in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Manlet must have made a lasting impression on Landreth 27 years ago because he 
even remembered her birth date. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, he presented Manlet with a cake at the tournament in honor of her 
41st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Manlet eventually grew embarrassed of Landreth, who was at the tournament as 
an Apple Valley High assistant coach, but she was heartened by the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 She is not one to step into the spotlight or boast about her success, so it 
stands to reason that she would eventually become uncomfortable with anyone's 
excessive crowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her record speaks clearly: Manlet is 245-76-1 in 13 seasons. Anyone 
with a winning percentage of .763 must have a coaching secret, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I've had a lot of talented kids," Manlet said. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt. But Manlet has helped mold them, including seven players who have 
gone on to play Division I softball. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior right-hander Sara Griffin, the 1993 state player of the year, is 
arguably Manlet's best yet. Griffin, who passed up a scholarship to UCLA and 
signed with Michigan, credits Manlet with much of the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a really positive attitude. She's very organized and very punctual," 
Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized and punctual may sound like pale praise, but Manlet has based her 
coaching philosophy on those fundamentals. Practices are run with the same 
structure and repetition of a top college team. Manlet ensures that every 
player stays focused on a designated role. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knows how to deal with people," Griffin said. "She doesn't put individual 
pressure on people that can't handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 The approach is simple but effective. Simi Valley went 26-1-1 last year, won 
the Southern Section Division I championship and was ranked No. 1 in the state 
by Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think last year's group of individuals each had a role and knew what I 
expected of them," Manlet said. "And because of it, I think all 16 players felt 
the same thrill that I did." 
</P>
<P>
 After 16 years of coaching softball, Manlet is still a student of the game. 
She frequently attends coaching clinics and as many college games as she can. 
When she isn't trying to improve as a coach, she is on the field as a player. 
Manlet plays in slo-pitch and fast-pitch leagues two to three times a week. At 
one point, she was playing five nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love the sport," she said. "I go out there and give it my all." 
</P>
<P>
 She coaches with the same enthusiasm. Watch Manlet coach from the third base 
box and see an adult not afraid to gush like a teen-ager. When a Simi Valley 
player gets a key hit or makes a great play, Manlet jumps up and down like a 
child on a trampoline. It's as refreshing as it is unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 Manlet completed Hueneme High about six years before most colleges fielded 
softball teams. Not playing in college is her biggest regret. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hueneme, Manlet was a year-round athlete, participating in track, 
basketball, softball and volleyball. But softball was her No. 1 love. She 
wanted to play for Northern Arizona, but because her mother had a heart 
condition and family funds were low, Manlet enrolled at Cal State Northridge 
even though the Matadors did not have a team. 
</P>
<P>
 She graduated from Northridge and earned her teaching credential in 1976. Two 
years later, Northridge fielded its first intercollegiate softball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had one (wish), it would be to play college ball," she said. "I really 
wish I had had a chance. But it's something that just won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Top area teams: 
</P>
<P>
 SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 26-1-1 (12-1-1, 1st in the Marmonte League) 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Suzanne Manlet, 14th year 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin makes the state's top-ranked Pioneers nearly impossible to beat. Only 
Camarillo managed it last season. In 23 games, only Agoura scored an earned run 
off the hard-throwing right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 In three season, Griffin has struck out 452 in 349 innings. She has an 0.12 
earned-run average and a 42-4 record. Last season she proved just as dominating 
with the bat. She batted .404 and clubbed a home run to lift the Pioneers to a 
1-0 victory over Los Alamitos in the Southern Section Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other starters return, including catcher Julie Difatta, center fielder 
Jessica Cunningham and second baseman Jenny Conmay. Shortstop Tracy Hansen, who 
batted .370 with 14 runs batted in, sustained an arm injury and is not expected 
to rejoin the team for at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 ALEMANY 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 22-8 (9-3, tied for 1st in Mission League) 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Dudley Rooney, 11th year 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, ranked No. 8 in the state by Cal-Hi Sports, have six starters 
returning, all juniors, including right-hander Sophie Contreras (20-3, 0.10 
ERA), who struck out 145 in 160 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means I'll be a great coach for two more years," Rooney cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 The other half of the returning battery is catcher Jamie Moore (.333). First 
baseman Alba Cano (.415) is the Indians' top returning batter. Sonja Maldonado 
will move from the outfield to second base. Tammy Alcantar (.347) is the 
shortstop and Esmeralda Macias (.300) is the veteran left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Dominguez, a hard-hitting sophomore, has earned a start at third base. 
Dominguez is six for seven with three doubles and two triples in the Indians' 
first two games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany, a Division III team, is perhaps the best hitting team in the region. 
And with Contreras in the pitching circle, the Indians will be tough to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 BUENA 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 20-6 (13-1, 1st in the Channel League) 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Sharon Coggins, 13th year 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs won a section title in 1989, and Coggins says they could win 
another this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine starters return. And no team in the region has better depth at pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Jenifer Malson (12-2), a rise-ball pitcher, is the returning ace. The 
staff also includes right-handers Tonya Triana, Rhondi Golden (4-1) and 
freshman Nicole Greathouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden, who has committed to Northwestern, also will play third base. Kristy 
Weber (.360), who has signed with Toledo, returns in center field. Senior twins 
Tammy and Jenifer Peck, who play second base and left field, are attracting 
interest from New Mexico. Both batted over .300 and combined for 26 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 SAUGUS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 15-9-1 (7-5, 3rd in the Foothill League) 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Ron Hilton, 12th year 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus has been riding a roller coaster the past couple of years. In 1992, on 
the strength of seven starting seniors, the Centurions advanced to the Southern 
Section 3-A Division final. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, with only three starters returning, Saugus barely earned a 
playoff berth and lost in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with seven returning starters, Saugus is ready to again contend for the 
championship. All nine starters play for a traveling team in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the best team I've ever had," Hilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Jamie Gillies (7-2, 0.62 ERA) will handle the pitching duties and 
junior Jeanine Giordano (.270) is the catcher. Junior Kelli Kranz (.340) and 
sophomore Chris Gill (.280) are power hitters. Senior Kim O'Leary, a slap 
hitter, batted .388. 
</P>
<P>
 CAMARILLO 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 23-7 (12-2, 2nd in the Marmonte League) 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Darwin Tolzin, 4th year 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Laura Richardson, who helped Camarillo win a section title in 1991, 
graduated last year and is playing at San Luis Obispo. In addition, there are 
no seniors in the starting lineup. But don't be fooled. Tolzin, once a top 
pitcher in men's fast-pitch leagues, has built a program that should remain 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Melanie Richardson, Laura's sister, is ready to take over at 
pitcher. Richardson and sophomore Krista Peterson shared pitching chores at the 
junior varsity level last season and will do the same for the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 Five starters return, including sophomore first baseman Jessica Zeise, 
sophomore designated hitter Sarah DeWoody and junior shortstop Julie Borchard, 
the Scorpions' Nos. 1-3 batters in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Five sophomores and two freshmen will start, but that doesn't necessarily mean 
it's a rebuilding year. "This is the best offensive team I've ever had," Tolzin 
said. "I'm really happy with this team." 
</P>
<P>
 NEWBURY PARK 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 20-7 (9-5, 3rd in the Marmonte League) 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Wally Thornhill, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
 Five starters return from last-year's overachieving team, including senior 
right-hander Carolina Bernal (10-3), who finished with an 0.47 ERA. Once again, 
Bernal will shoulder the bulk of the load, but will get some relief from 
sophomore right-hander Kristi Fox, who was 14-0 on the junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 Returnees include power hitter Jann Thorpe (third base) and slap hitter Brandi 
Funk (second base), who batted .326 with a .419 one-base percentage. Junior 
Mandy Cunningham (.230) is a returning catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior varsity team went 25-0 last season behind sophomore shortstop 
Melissa Thornhill (.541), the coach's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 HOOVER 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 23-2-1 (9-1, 1st in the Pacific League) 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Kirt Kohlmeier, 5th year 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover lost the irreplaceable Nancy Evans, who is playing for top-ranked 
Arizona. Sophomore right-hander Tina Kinney is no Evans (at least that's what 
she has been telling teammates), but she will keep the Tornadoes in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Shannon Feliz, a power hitter, is a four-year starter and one of six 
who return. Catcher Meredith Butler, who played outfield last year, and second 
baseman Emily Carlson are three-year starters. 
</P>
<P>
 QUARTZ HILL 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 20-6 (14-1, 1st in the Golden League) 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Coy Ray, 7th year 
</P>
<P>
 Six starters return, including pitchers Mary Flores and Correna Berlinger, 
both of whom were 10-3 last season. Ray is hoping one will outshine the other. 
"I'm looking for one pitcher to step up," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Lolita Allen (catcher), Nicci Manduca (third base) and Cindy Sims 
(shortstop) each hit above .300 last season. Manduca has given a commitment to 
play for Purdue. Senior Amanda Richards returns at first base.

SOUTHERN SECTION TO TAKE FURTHER AIM AT POOR SPORTSMANSHIP; PREP SPORTS: 
GOVERNING BODY PLANS TASK FORCE TO PRODUCE A BOOK ON THE SUBJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 In an attempt to control trash-talking, profanity and violence in high school 
sports, the Southern Section Executive Committee said Thursday it plans to 
produce a "Book on Sportsmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, the section's acting commissioner, held up a stack about 
eight-inches thick of boys' basketball ejection slips during the section's 
general council meeting at the Sequoia Athletic Club. He then held up a 
considerably smaller stack that included all girls' sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purity is still there in girls' sports," Crowley said. "The guys want to 
knock each other on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 To compile the book, the section will set up a task force, which will include 
representatives from such groups as athletes, student-body presidents, coaches, 
boosters, principals and section administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Sportsmanship is addressed in the section's constitution and by-laws, which 
direct those involved in high school athletics "to emphasize the proper ideals 
of sportsmanship, ethical conduct and fair play." Donn Clickard, representing 
the Southern Section Executive Committee, said the section wants the words to 
become reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping to get it all underway by the end of the school year," said 
Clickard, athletic director at Atascadero High. "And hopefully in the future it 
is something the State Federation will also adopt." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved a cost-containment proposal that will require all 
proposals coming before it to address the financial implications on member 
schools and the section at large. 
</P>
<P>
 In non-action proposals brought before the council: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eric Walter, the Liberty League president, proposed that all profits from 
playoff competition be returned to the section. Presently, profits are split 
between the participating schools (25% each) and the section (50%). Under 
Walter's proposal, all member schools would share monies equally. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Liza Daniels, principal of Inglewood Morningside High, presented 
recommendations from the Blue Book committee regarding sportsmanship to be 
included in the section's 1994-95 by-laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The bench conduct rule would disqualify any player who leaves the bench or 
team area during a fight from participating in the remainder of the game. Also, 
he or she would be ineligible for the next game. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach ejection rule, which originally called for the game to be forfeited 
if a coach is ejected, was amended. It now reads that if a coach is ejected, he 
would be suspended for one game. 
</P>
<P>
 These recommendations will be voted upon at the council's next meeting, April 
28.

CAMPBELL QUITS AS CONCORDIA BASKETBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concordia women's basketball Coach Sharon Campbell resigned Thursday after one 
season with the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, who supplemented her part-time position coaching the Eagles with 
work as a residence counselor at the university, is pursuing several other jobs 
that would combine coaching, teaching and administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles were 15-13, 5-5 in the Golden State Athletic Conference, under 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a difficult decision for me because I like it here and this program 
has so much potential," Campbell said. "However, I know that now is the time to 
move into a full-time role."

SHE SAID, HE SAID / ANN CONWAY AND PATRICK MOTT: A 'MILLION' NICHE AND TIDY 
IDEAS ABOUT PIGEONHOLES THE SIZE OF CLOSETS

 W e've bumped into the book "Dress Like a Million (on Considerably Less)" by 
Leah Feldon ($20, Villard Books). In it, the author, who also wrote "Dressing 
Rich," describes the five corners of today's fashion: Bas Couture, MTV Chic, Le 
Sportif Motif, Classic Chic and styles worn by YEEPS (Young Environmentally 
Enlightened Professionals). We knew all of you fashionably hip would want to 
know about this. And, of course, you'd want our unbiased opinions about these 
LOOKS of the '90s . . .  
</P>
<P>
 SHE: First, definitions of the five fashion looks: Feldon calls Bas Couture 
"dressing down." Actually, bas (pronounced bah ) literally means "low" fashion, 
she writes. It is the opposite of haute couture or high fashion. "It is a 
studied casualness -- distressed jeans, thrift store frocks, Doc Martens, 
over-large clothes, mismatched styles . . . textures." 
</P>
<P>
 MTV Chic ensembles are usually "skintight," she observes. "Spandex, Lycra, 
leather and lace are the main fabrics." 
</P>
<P>
 Le Sportif Motif is about "dressing like a jock . . . in leotards, stirrup 
pants, motorcycle jackets, dresses shaped like wet suits." 
</P>
<P>
 Classic Chic is all about "simple elegance, taste, class . . . sticking to the 
best of the classics and eschewing any style that smacks of trendy," Feldon 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 YEEPS dressing is the '90s version of the '70s preppy look and the '80s yuppie 
style. "They like natural fabrics, live in . . . cotton chinos, cords, blue 
denim shirts, loafers, earth tones. Round, horn-rimmed glasses add to the 
look." 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I was all set to call Feldon another trendoid gimmick-monger until I read 
her take on that classic chic business. After each category she lists the pros 
and cons of each look, and the first three entries have as many things to damn 
them as to recommend them. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the only bad thing she has to say about classic chic: "If you're the 
adventuresome, experimental, avant-garde, artsy type, you could be bored by 
classy understatement. Classic chic is not on the cutting edge of fashion. 
Sorry, but that's the only drawback I can think of." 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry? I bless you, Ms. Feldon. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I love the way she lists examples of men and women who have epitomized 
the looks about which she writes. Her examples for classic chic include Jackie 
Onassis and the two late greats, Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to bas couture , she calls Diane Keaton its "grandmother" and 
says Sinead O'Connor epitomizes the look. 
</P>
<P>
 Her examples for MTV chic? Madonna, of course. And Marisa Tomei, the Hell's 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Flo-Jo and Jane Fonda represent Le Sportif Motif. 
</P>
<P>
 The YEEPs look? "Thank yous," she writes, "to the Gap and clones, Calvin 
Klein, Ralph Lauren and Katharine Hepburn." 
</P>
<P>
 Where do you fit in? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Classic when I have money. Low-end YEEP when I don't. If I'd listened to 
my mother and become a lawyer, I could have all the Austin Reed suits and Bally 
loafers and cashmere sweaters and Turnbull & Asser shirts and Hermes ties I 
wanted. As it is, the Dockers people and I are on very good terms. And I'm 
still on the Land's End mailing list. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd guess you're more of an MTV/classic hybrid. Yes? 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Gasp! How did you know about my leather, spandex and Lycra? (OK, so I 
have three leather jackets and a million bathing suits.) 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, you've pegged me to a tee. I love the classics -- wear them 90% of 
the time -- but when I party I love to wear something fitted and sexy. Will I 
ever grow up? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Not if you're lucky. It's all a matter of being yourself and, more 
importantly, knowing yourself. You can pull all that off, both psychologically 
and physically. But you'd never in a million years go for that bas couture 
stuff, right? You and grunge are not on speaking terms, right? (Right?) 
</P>
<P>
 I'm more limited. Even if I were sleek and had coal-black hair and could 
actually wear MTV duds, I still wouldn't. I'd feel foolish, as if I were in a 
costume instead of clothes. But I would feel comfortable in a hacking jacket 
and boots, which actually is more of a costume than simple clothing. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Bas couture rubs me the wrong way. It's just too cute, too 
look-at-little-old-rag-doll-me. I wouldn't be caught dead in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Put me in the desert, though, and I can do a pretty good imitation of the Le 
Sportif Motif look. I've found my all-black wardrobe doesn't cut it in sun 
country, so I've bought some pastel workout togs. Now, if I only had Jane's 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Yes, I've often thought that too, provided that Jane's body was sitting on 
my couch at the time. But (hee hee) I digress. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm with you on the sporty clothes. You don't necessarily have to have a body 
that you could strike matches off of in order to look good in a nice 
coordinated jogging suit. The problem is, some of them cost as much as a nice, 
coordinated business suit. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's join Ms. Feldon in calling for the death of bicycle shorts as a 
fashion statement. Bike shorts were made for one reason: to keep your thighs 
from chafing when you ride. They were not made for lounging around the carrot 
juice bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Got the legs for bike shorts? Good. Use them to spin the pedals.

 Espadrilles have become required equipment for spring in an array of fabrics, 
colors and novelty designs. "This season's flirty floral skirts and dresses are 
very feminine and very light," notes Cassie Hughes of Esprit. "So a shoe is 
needed that's easy, relaxed, not stuffy." Esprit offers versions that fit the 
rage for natural, raw fabrics. Try the daisy flat ($22) or macrame-top platform 
($31), both with jute wedge bottoms. The Rebirth of Cool

 While T-shirts are still a staple in wardrobes of the hip, young and male, 
retro-inspired sweaters are going over big -- both in popularity and in size. 
The faves? Those that recall the be-bop age of jazz, such as Unitryb's knits 
made with diamond patterns or wide, vertical stripes. "It's a timeless look," 
says designer Jeff Catalano of the San Diego label. And that's key now even 
among trendy teens. "Style is everything," he adds, "and it's good to see young 
people getting into that." Yo, Karly Karl

 There's a house party going down at the House of Chanel with Grandmaster Karl 
Lagerfeld doing his take on hip-hop flavored streetwear. Divas are stepping out 
in sneakers detailed with patent leather ($545) and holding up their oversized 
denim shorts ($600) with signature suspenders ($165). "We're getting calls for 
the suspenders like you won't believe," says Roger Martin, director of the 
South Coast Plaza boutique. The one-size-fits-all shorts, complete with a 
stitched quilt pattern on the back pockets, are almost sold out, Martin adds. 
And they haven't arrived in stores yet. Chanel-clad rap fans can show their 
colors with a logo-splashed bandanna ($55). Sweet Touch

 Sugar, lemon and a dash of herbs. Sound like the makings of dessert? Try the 
ingredients for a formula to remove hair. It's an ancient Egyptian recipe 
that's become the hottest alternative to waxing. Known as body sugaring, the 
process is gentler on skin than hot wax, which can irritate. And the paste 
leaves skin soft and smooth, says Jean Azar, a spokesman for Juan Juan Salon in 
Beverly Hills. "It's 100% natural. It also removes more hair than wax does, so 
it doesn't have to be done as often." Prices start at $10 for the area above 
the lip and go to $60 for a full-leg treatment. ROSE APODACA

FACE TO FACE, RACE TO RACE; BLAME AND GUILT. GUILT AND BLAME. THE UPROAR OVER 
NATHAN MCCALL'S ANGRY MEMOIR UNDERSCORES THAT THE SEARCH FOR UNDERSTANDING 
BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE HAS BARELY BEGUN. 
</P>

<P>
 As a restless adolescent, Nathan McCall had a sure way to vent his rage: He'd 
get together with his buddies and thrash a passing "white boy." Any white boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating a victim with sticks, kicking him in the testicles and stomping on his 
head as it gushed blood, "made us feel good inside," McCall writes in his 
autobiography, "Makes Me Wanna Holler -- A Young Black Man in America." 
</P>
<P>
 McCall and his pals also had a way to release sexual tension: They lured 
unsuspecting neighborhood girls -- African American girls -- and gang-raped 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming of age in the 1960s and '70s, McCall committed burglaries, took drugs, 
dealt drugs, robbed people, did drive-bys and shot a young black rival in the 
chest point-blank. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that moment," McCall writes, "I felt like God." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later and on the road to promote "Holler," McCall looks dazed as 
he enters the glistening lobby of the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In many corners, television and radio hosts have adopted the handsome author 
with the hip goatee -- now a reporter at the Washington Post -- as their latest 
media darling. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, McCall stepped into the crucible of L.A. talk radio and 
abruptly became a lightning rod for a city brimming with its own rage about 
violence, race and responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 During Michael Jackson's KABC radio show, listeners learned that McCall 
received a 30-day sentence for shooting that black man, but later got 12 years 
for robbing a white-owned McDonald's. To McCall, the message was clear: "The 
Establishment holds very low regard for the value of black life as opposed to 
the value of white property." 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Jackson interrupted, the civility draining from his British lilt. " You 
hold very low regard for black life. We haven't tried to kill anyone. You 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 Callers were no more gentle. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, McCall, 40, took off his African-style cap and laid his sports 
coat on one of the hotel room's two queen beds. Slumping into an antique chair, 
his head lolled back like a slug-drunk prizefighter's. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was clear to me early on that the interview was going to be more like a 
feeding frenzy than a dialogue," McCall says, his words slipping out in a long 
sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 But what can you expect? he asks. Jackson made him sound as if he hadn't 
transcended his criminal youth, hadn't grappled with the convoluted meaning of 
his actions; made him out to be "just another black man making excuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is not the only reader to find McCall infuriatingly adept at blaming 
"the white man" for his failings. "Black rage by itself, deeply justified 
though it is, is no longer news," the New York Times Book Review said, later 
adding: "Mr. McCall does not sound like an easy person to live or work with." 
</P>
<P>
 But other critics heap praise on McCall for what they see as his unflinchingly 
honest insight into America's cycle of responsibility and blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while McCall gets hammered and soothed, his book may be emerging as a 
painful catalyst for people struggling toward a higher and more complex level 
of race relations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan McCall grew up in Cavalier Manor, a working-class black neighborhood in 
Portsmouth, Va. Built in the early '60s, the neighborhood boasted big homes and 
streets named after prominent African Americans: Belafonte Drive, Basie 
Crescent, Horne Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall's stepfather, retired Navy, worked weekdays as a guard at the naval 
shipyards and did weekend gardening jobs in a white suburb. Nathan and his 
brothers lived a "Huck Finn" childhood, playing cowboys and Indians, skinny 
dipping in a nearby lake and mowing lawns for spare change. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavalier Manor was the sort of supportive community that pundits mourn these 
days, where neighbors watched each others' children for signs of misbehavior 
and teachers and parents chatted after church. 
</P>
<P>
 As Nate and his friends edged uneasily into adolescence, though, a flood of 
influences swept away their innocence. While concerned parents talked about 
self-respect and the dignity of work, the dudes on the corner taught that peers 
conferred street respect. And that respect accrued most readily, he writes, to 
"a crazy nigger or a baad nigger." In a long series of small decisions, McCall 
evolved from mischievous scamp to petty criminal to dangerous thug. 
</P>
<P>
 His conscience spoke up from time to time, urging him, for instance, to 
explain himself to the mother who had tried so hard to insulate him from the 
ugly life he embraced. But, McCall writes, "I couldn't process my confusion 
sufficiently in my own head to explain it to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, remorse occasionally flickered through his consciousness after a 
criminal act. But added respect on the street invariably chased that soft 
emotion into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall finally went to prison for pointing a .32 caliber pistol at a 
McDonald's manager's head during a robbery: "Intuitively," McCall writes from 
his then-19-year-old perspective, "I sensed he was an Uncle Tom, one of those 
head-scratching niggers, willing to put his devalued life on the line to 
protect the white man's property." 
</P>
<P>
 His prison stint put him in contact with the usual sources of unofficial 
rehab: Nation of Islam Muslims, cellblock philosophers. The strongest 
influence, however, may have been Richard Wright's "Native Son," the classic 
novel about Bigger Thomas, an angry young black man who blunders into violence 
and is imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall saw in Bigger the same "restless anger, hopelessness, the tough facade 
among blacks and a deep-seated fear of whites -- that I'd sensed in myself but 
was unable to express." 
</P>
<P>
 The book made him sob. It also made him read more and inspired his desire to 
write. Eventually, McCall wrote so well that he was offered a journalism 
scholarship to Norfolk State University, where he had once robbed students. He 
accepted it when he was paroled after three years in prison and excelled. 
</P>
<P>
 In the March 7 New Yorker, Henry Louis Gates compares McCall's book to Claude 
Brown's "Manchild in the Promised Land" and to Wright's novels. He says McCall 
may well provide the voice of a generation and warmly applauds his 
metamorphosis: "Bigger Thomas becoming Richard Wright." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates also notes a puzzle. While the prison transformation is 
comprehensible, another is less so: Why did Nathan McCall become Bigger Thomas 
in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 That question may be at the root of what rankles those who seem ready to 
string up the adult McCall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCall stares across a small desk in his hotel room: "I think the first 
inclination of a white person is to say, 'I haven't oppressed anybody. I 
haven't seen anyone oppress anybody. So what are they talking about?' It's 
often hard trying to explain to a white person how you experience oppression 
and then how you internalize it, and what you do with it once you internalize 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even now, there are people who wonder what McCall is talking about. In 
"Holler," the author describes his climb through the ranks of journalism, from 
a small Virginia paper, to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, to the coveted 
newsroom of the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 He perceived racism at every step, including confrontations that his white 
colleagues saw as the standard conflicts that ignite amid fierce competition. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall stands by his interpretation but acknowledges that oppression is often 
in the eye of the beholder: "You don't even know half the time whether 
something is really attributable to racism or not. . . . Race has gotten so 
much under our skin that it's hard to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 He also says that "to a certain degree, nothing held me back but my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 But then, of course, a young mind is invariably shaped by outside influences. 
It took awhile before even McCall noticed the forces he now believes undermined 
his identity. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls his beloved grandmother, Bampoose, who would come home from her 
housekeeping job with a wealthy family and hold McCall and his brothers up to 
the example of their flawless white children. 
</P>
<P>
 And on weekends, the boys often went with their stepfather to the fancy suburb 
where he gardened. They seethed at having to pull crabgrass for a white woman. 
They thought less of their stepfather for doing so, and later McCall would 
bristle at a white boss's nagging. 
</P>
<P>
 Countless men of McCall's age will read such scenes and think back to their 
own youth. They pulled weeds. Bosses heaped abuse on them. Yet they took it as 
a fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
 For many people, a man's repeated discussion of such matters might sound like 
sniveling, plain and simple. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall ruminated on that a few years ago when he returned to his hometown and 
saw two white men driving a truck with "lawn and garden care" on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 It dawned on him, he says: "My stepfather had a business." 
</P>
<P>
 But then, those white gardeners weren't burdened with the nagging knowledge 
that since slavery, whites have had a tradition of humiliating black adults and 
treating them as children. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a white man working for another white man, that kind of degradation and 
humiliation is not an issue, the issue is the job," McCall says, pressing his 
fingers together until the tips turn beige. "For us, the issue has always been, 
'Am I gonna have to face the prospect of exchanging a paycheck for humiliation? 
Is it going to be conditional?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Those questions, McCall says, kept him from seeing heroism in his stepfather's 
hard work: 
</P>
<P>
 "When I looked at my stepfather, I think that may have been one of the first 
times I saw limitations. Does this mean I'm gonna be a gardener, working for 
white folks down the road? As a 13-year-old, I looked at him as a potential 
role model, and I looked at the guys hanging on the corner, who were posturing 
and acting bad and at least giving the perception that they were men, and the 
choice for me was easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a warped model of manhood contorts the psyche, and confuses the clean 
distinction between victim and victimizer that a frustrated society 
increasingly demands. Even as a prospering professional, McCall writes about 
his gang assaults on "white boys," for example, not with remorse for the 
physical and psychic damage he inflicted, but with regret that he no longer has 
that therapeutic outlet: "Man, that used to take the stress outta me." 
</P>
<P>
 Challenged about that, McCall again spins the wheel of 
responsibility-and-blame: He only started hating whites after a bunch of white 
boys beat him up in junior high, he says. And don't forget that when he was a 
boy, whites sometimes drove by in cars, threw things at him, and called him 
"nigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, he asks, "How often in interviews do white people ask other white 
people if they have remorse?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, McCall's voice catches as he reflects on the televised beating, 25 
years after his assaults, of Reginald Denny. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that struck me most about that," he says, "was how so many innocent 
people get consumed, get eaten up by this racial hatred. . . . (Later) I saw 
(Denny as) this guy who really, really embodied forgiveness. . . . They didn't 
catch a Klansman. They caught a good human being coming through there. And that 
hurt me." 
</P>
<P>
 Which doesn't mean McCall agrees with those who would throw away the 
prison-door key for Denny's attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The front end" is the place to stop crime and address racial animosity, 
McCall says: Improve education, create opportunity. Filling more prisons with 
"three strikes and you're out" legislation won't work, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every 17-year-old you lock up, there's someone else who just celebrated 
his 17th birthday. If he's subjected to the same forces that shaped the 
thinking of the first 17-year-old, then he will replace him." 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. Stop the wheel! society might shout at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 If dangerous young men, such as those McCall describes in his book, were 
locked up for longer spells, wouldn't the streets be safer for the majority of 
young black men who have never committed a crime -- for McCall's own 
20-year-old son? Would the number of mothers crying at children's funerals not 
decline if more violent criminals stayed behind bars? 
</P>
<P>
 McCall ponders that. "Yeaaaah, I guess you could say that. . . . But you know, 
you could probably say the same thing about me. . . . (And) here I am. I think 
I've been trying to contribute something ever since I got out of prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a caller to Jackson's radio program -- who identified herself as a 
black woman -- didn't care that McCall has been creative, rather than 
destructive, for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe you should be behind bars," she said, reflecting society's growing 
frustration with the slaughter on the streets and a growing impatience for 
solutions -- future Nathan McCalls be damned. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall agrees there is a growing impatience. 
</P>
<P>
 But to give in to that, he says, "suggests that society has done everything it 
can do to address the problem. And that's not the case."

THE FALL COLLECTIONS / PARIS; A QUIET RETURN TO ROMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ROURKE, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every season, one show here goes beyond fashion. It gives people a slice of 
Paris life they could never find on their own. This time, the Xuly Bet show was 
the ticket. Staged on an empty floor of Le Samarataine, a local department 
store, and attended by all the usual suspects from the fashion industry plus a 
hundred or so of the designer's friends, it was a reminder of where style is 
born -- in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 A rock band played "Foxy Lady," the Jimi Hendrix number, and at least half the 
crowd thought of it as music from their parents' generation. They were the half 
who brought the freshest style to the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with Lamine Kouyate himself. He's the twentysomething Mali native who 
designs the Xuly Bet collection. Imagine him dressed in a tailored white shirt, 
sleeves rolled well above the elbows, topped by a fitted white T-shirt touting 
his company name and the slogan "100% Pure Afro." 
</P>
<P>
 Tied around his waist were a patterned red sweater rolled up like a cummerbund 
and, over that, the sleeves of a navy peacoat. In khaki pants, with African 
trading beads around his neck and wrist, dreadlock bangs pushed back against a 
crew cut, eyes sparkling, knees bending to the beat of the music, he was the 
joyous host of a huge, earthy bash. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience provided the best street fashion show of the week. One outfit was 
built around a kente-cloth baseball hat and a bush jacket cut from a patchwork 
of African textile. Another standout played day against evening wear, with a 
white T-shirt, satin slip dress, rhinestone "princess" necklace and pink Fair 
Isle cardigan sweater. A man in a monkey-fur hat shaped like a bell would have 
been surprised to hear that monkey was the preferred fur this season at Chanel. 
A woman with rhinestone-studded hair veiling her face turned out to be one of 
the models. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Paris underground, surfacing at the barely civil hour of 3 p.m., its 
cultural roots newly dug up from Africa, Asia and Europe as well as the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Xuly Bet's collection was meant for this crowd to admire. Teal and black 
herringbone slip dresses with long flared skirts, patchwork plaid shirtdresses 
that hugged the models straight to their heels, leopard-print fishnet tunics 
and turquoise print tube dresses were among the best of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Kouyate has used tight, stretchy tube dresses as a first layer for several 
seasons. Karl Lagerfeld does something similar and calls it the "skin dress." 
Kouyate puts shorter tunics or longer tweed jackets over his. Lagerfeld might 
add a complete suit. 
</P>
<P>
 For some women, the skin dress could become part of a modern wardrobe, as 
indispensable as leggings. But those who put functional dressing ahead of the 
latest look might find it too contrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest trend to emerge on Paris runways this season is sure to catch 
on. Romantic dressing, especially with a glamorous edge, has pushed away the 
waifs, the grungettes and the motorcycle mamas who overran French fashion last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 This return to romance shined through in some of the youngest as well as the 
oldest Paris collections, Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Valentino among them. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chanel, black sequined evening dresses had short, bell-shaped skirts to 
accent the hips. Big hips played a key part in several collections. Vivienne 
Westwood actually added cushions to the models' hips for her show. Curves like 
that haven't been seen since the Victorian era. 
</P>
<P>
 Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld's bigger game plan this season was to host a 
fashion Olympics. Black chiffon dresses with cashmere cardigan sweaters had 
bold pink or yellow stripes at the neckline, cuffs and hem, to imitate 
athletes' active wear. Black tulle evening pants had ivory racer's stripes down 
the side. And models wrapped short velvet unitards in vast cashmere scarves 
that looked like their national flags. Naomi Campbell wore a British flag 
shawl, Linda Evangelista had the Canadian maple leaf design, and Carla Bruni 
wore the triple stripes of her native Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic-inspired day wear ranged from a skater's dress with quilted leather 
belt and short circle skirt, to ski suits, parkas and warm-up pants in downhill 
racer fabrics. Most were mixed with pastel tweed jacket suits and tank-top 
dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagerfeld skated too close to the ice follies with some brightly colored 
skirts that looked like monkey-fur snowballs. Otherwise, the Chanel Winter 
Games gave yet another blast of energy to those venerable tweed suits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Standouts at Saint Laurent were a raspberry suede bathrobe coat whipstitched 
in lighter red, a black cashmere T-shirt worn with sable-cuffed black gloves, 
and a quilted parka in a silky print of red roses against a deeper red 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple chic ranged from a charcoal gray shirttail jacket over lighter gray 
wide-legged pants to a perfectly proportioned black velvet evening dress with a 
deep inverted pleat from the waist. Saint Laurent showed it with a black velvet 
belt and a sculptured gold cuff bracelet on each wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valentino, evening wear ruled the runway. A gold lace suit had a 
scallop-edged cardigan jacket that all but covered a short matching skirt. A 
black wool suit had black sequins and silk braid to decorate flap pockets. The 
bosom of a bronze chiffon evening gown was wrapped and twisted for a Grecian 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Valentino and Samarataine kept daytime skirts above the knee. Red and 
black were a favorite color combination. And fattened pumps or tall, satin 
boots were the referred footwear. Some of Valentino's evening boots were 
trimmed in marabou. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of Paris can be told in a short list: 
</P>
<P>
 * Skirts are short again. Most designers showed them just above the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jackets cover the hips or stop just above the waist. Most of the longer 
styles curve in at the waist. Shorter versions are wide enough to make the 
waist look smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 * Knee-length coats and coat dresses are a strong look. The best have small 
buttons the same color as the coat, nothing brassy or bright. Designers showed 
them with tall, flat-heeled boots or with tights and short, lace-up boots with 
heels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Suits with matching skirts and jackets in subtle tweeds are a focus. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pantsuits, especially in shiny wool fabrics such as gabardine or flannel, 
have pleated menswear pants and relaxed shirtlike jackets. Pants are a strong 
option for day. Some designers showed them with thicker high-heeled shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Evening wear is long and romantic, but not droopy, dopey or mopey. Dresses 
have a definite shape that gives them some energy. Call it an edge.

CAFE SOCIETY / MEZZALUNA: MANY PHASES OF FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE SEIPP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Place: Mezzaluna, an Italian restaurant and bar, 9428 Brighton Way, 
Beverly Hills; (310) 275-6703. 
</P>
<P>
 Atmosphere: Swirly, busy (especially on Tuesday nights), loud. Over delicious, 
upscale Italian food, single women attract immediate interest ("I saw you 
sitting alone . . . and I admire that"), bodies jostle at the crowded bar, 
swanky music plays loudly, a wood-burning fireplace flickers, and big hair (men 
and women) tumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving Up Style: White aprons over black "Mezzaluna" T-shirts and black jeans 
for the waiters; for the waitresses, the same aprons with provocative black 
tops, paired with neck interest (black velvet choker with dangling topaz) and 
black jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venetian chef ("May I make you up something special tonight? . . . My 
sardines are fresh, not oily, as in can") wears all white. 
</P>
<P>
 Customer Themes: Brown leather bomber jackets; colorful vests; crisp white 
shirts or crisp polka-dotted blouses; designer jeans; black cowboy boots; lacy 
bodysuits; business suits; for the well-fed European, middle-aged man look: 
teddy-bearish sweaters over small-collared shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hair Apparent: For the women: Heather Locklear-like blond tresses artfully 
fall forward over eyebrows and behind ears, or big, permy locks tumble and 
shake. For the men: the ubiquitous silver shag, usually chin or mid-neck 
length. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessories: Expensive-looking Swiss watches, usually with a thick, chain-link 
band ("Is my watch expensive? Well . . . it's all relative"); shiny gold or 
studded belts; hoop earrings; velvet or pearl chokers; newly acquired phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Rule: If thou art a single man and thou spotteth a single woman, thou 
shalt effortlessly slide thy cup of coffee over to her table -- and sitteth 
with her, before she realizes whateth is happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Observations: The ultra-protective host and waiters immediately notice any new 
man who's joined a single woman's table. Behind the man's back, they'll signal 
to the woman -- to see if the man is a "yea" or a "nay." 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "My ex-girlfriend was a Sikh for awhile. . . . She showed me her 
driver's license -- she had on a full turban and everything." 
</P>

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: GONE -- LIKE MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DEBRA GENDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>

 Like model Ines de la Fressange before her, Claudia Schiffer has fallen out of 
favor with designer Karl Lagerfeld. It seems la Schiffer had the gall to appear 
in a Fanta soft drink ad. This, Lagerfeld told W magazine, was "stooping too 
low."  
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the designer's shows Monday in Paris, Schiffer disappeared 
without so much as a congratulations, according to Reuters. (De la Fressange's 
crime? The former Chanel model posed for a bust of Marianne, France's national 
symbol.) 
</P>
<P>
 C'est la vie. Who needs a temperamental German designer anyway when you've got 
a rich American magician? Yes, it's true. David Copperfield proposed to 
Schiffer recently while the pair vacationed in the Caribbean. "Her answer was 
yes," said Copperfield in April's Esquire. Schiffer says that in her native 
Germany, "not knowing about David Copperfield is like not knowing about Michael 
Jackson." Hmmm. Perhaps another superstar might be better, Claudia. Like 
Siegfried or Roy? 
</P>
<P>
 Captain's Log: Our copy of Victoria's Secret Swimwear Edition arrived this 
week and we were struck by how patriotic the "Premier (sic) Issue" is. Cover 
model Elle Macpherson dangles from a sailboat wearing a bikini that looks like 
an American flag -- minus about 40 states.  
</P>
<P>
 "Drawing from over a decade of expertise designing beautiful, superb fitting 
lingerie," reads the catalogue's introductory page, "we've created this 
extraordinary collection with the same meticulous eye to quality, design and 
fit." (But not, apparently, to typos.)  
</P>
<P>
 Spotting an attractive suit, we pulled out our Citibank Visa and noted that 
we're a "Premier Member." "Oooh," squealed the Victoria's Secret operator: 
"You're the first one to order from that catalogue!" Guess that makes us the 
premier customer. Oh, stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping Sagas: We heard everybody brought their kids to the Barneys opening 
Saturday, but, frankly, our kids aren't Barneys material. They eat Crunch 'N' 
Munch in the aisles and whine over who deserves hideous pink vinyl dress-up 
shoes. Not only that, fashion irony is completely over their heads. Why, they'd 
take one look at, say, a baby-doll dress and pronounce it babyish.  
</P>
<P>
 So we piled in the station wagon and headed for Target, where -- surprise -- 
it was Dollar Days. Will the owner of a yellow Mercedes please move their car? 
alternated with It's not fair! till we fled the place, exhausted. But not 
before carting away several hundreds of dollars' worth of bargains. It was a 
good day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thin Gold Line: Just like they teach you in film school, the camera does 
fiddle with reality -- or what passes for it. Designers Sonya Rykiel, 
Gianfranco Ferre and Christian Lacroix have alternately juiced up or scaled 
down their collections this week in Paris, apparently for the benefit of 
filmmaker Robert Altman, there to shoot his look at ready to wear, 
"Pret-a-Porter." And if all went as planned last night 400 guests converged for 
a party staged by Altman and Paolo Bulgari. 
</P>
<P>
 The jewelry scion used the fictional party sequence as a glamorous backdrop 
for the introduction of a new line of Bulgari jewels. Endorsement-happy Claudia 
Schiffer and Brandi -- the latest teen-age head turner -- presented the line. 
And the entire affair was immortalized by Helmut Newton. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Is This Night Different?: Just in time for Passover later this month is 
the arrival in our synagogue gift shop of kosher lipstick. Colors include Milk 
'N' Honey Mocha, Promised Land Pink, Dead Sea Red and Galilee Garnet. For $8, 
you get "purity, cleanliness and quality." But, oy, the colors. Our Sheyn Ponim 
pink turned Pepto-Bismol on our lips faster than you could say pass the gefilte 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Semiotics of Smelling: When you talk about Calvin Klein's new fragrance -- 
and we know that you will -- don't call it unisex. "That's not the word I use," 
insisted Klein in an interview with Women's Wear Daily. "But I am working on 
those kinds of ideas. It's about sharing a common thing." And in the cautious 
'90s, sex isn't necessarily it. 
</P>
<P>
 Around Town: It's official. Singer k.d. lang will perform during the May 5 
California Fashion Industry Friends of AIDS Project L.A. benefit honoring Isaac 
Mizrahi . . . O.J. Simpson will appear Saturday at I. Magnin in Beverly Hills 
from 2 to 4 p.m. to promote DKNY menswear and his favorite charity, Camp Ronald 
McDonald. The store is making a contribution to the camp for children with 
cancer and will match donations made by the public.

BEHIND THE SCENES; TOGA PARTY GUARANTEES PLENTY OF SHEET THRILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 150 guests who attended a toga party to support the Eastbluff Boys and 
Girls Club in Newport Beach on Saturday took the ancient Romans to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wore the get-up of their favorite Roman gods and goddesses, while others 
showed their nuttier, mere mortal side at the event held in the club's gym. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like Halloween in Circus Maximus. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a tourist with a Hawaiian shirt and clashing plaid toga; a nun in a 
revealing backless black sheath with torso-sized cross; a soldier in a 
camouflage cloak and helmet, and a mom-to-be with pacifiers and booties 
dangling from her blue satin wrap. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Caesar's day, the togas were also personalized by their length and the 
manner in which they were draped. 
</P>
<P>
 The pieces of cloth were semicircular, oval or rectangular. They were 
carefully wrapped around the body, falling gracefully into folds that reached 
the knee, calf or ankle. Tucked under the right arm and hung over the left 
shoulder, the garments were fastened at the shoulder with brooches or grape 
bunches and adorned at the waist with tassel cords or gold chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Embroidered borders, vibrant silk fabrics, loose tunic undergarments and hair 
decorations -- bands, caps, scarves and laurel wreaths -- completed the look. 
</P>
<P>
 The awkward moments? Seeing men trying to maneuver without easily accessible 
pockets.

FAUX PAS REPORT: THE SPORTY JACKET IS ALL WET FOR WORK: GENTLEMEN NEED AN 
OVERCOAT OF SORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winter is winding down, but we're still facing some cool, and even wet, 
mornings as we make our way to work. Unfortunately, most people don't have a 
high enough rank in the company to warrant a parking space near the front door, 
and a brisk walk through the elements is the way they start the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Guys who go to work in blazers or suits are presented with a bit of a fashion 
problem. When it's cold or drizzly, they'll show up at the office wearing a 
sporty, bright, light jacket in place of an overcoat. And while they may only 
be wearing it from the door to the desk, it can make an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to have a traditional overcoat; in fact, you don't usually 
need one living here," says John Shaw of Alex Sebastian in Costa Mesa. "What 
you need is a basically neutral jacket that covers your suit coat." 
</P>
<P>
 To fill the need, try a tame ski parka or some of the other lighter, sportier 
jackets that have good long sleeves and that drop low enough to at least cover 
your wallet. And don't freak out about your wallet shrinking when you buy one; 
most outerwear jackets are on sale now. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoulder politics: In a perfect world, you could wear heart-patterned pink 
underwear as a headband to the office every day and yet be judged by how you 
get the job done. But of course, there are politics to traditional office dress 
that pertain to everyone. And even though styles have loosened up over the 
years, there are still some things you don't do. Unfortunately, no one's told 
the women who show up for work wearing off-the-shoulder tops. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a conservative environment, you're sending out the wrong signal," says 
fashion consultant Sara D'Allessandro of Yorba Linda. "Save those 
off-the-shoulder blouses and dresses for evening wear." 
</P>
<P>
 The bare shoulder look can be OK if you're in a hip, creative business, but 
don't take it too far. You don't want to look like you went from a wild night 
of clubbing straight to the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lint loathing: How can you tell if your boss has gone to lunch? If he's 
wearing dark wool slacks or she's got on a dark wool skirt or dress, check the 
lap. A white linen napkin will probably leave a telltale imprint of lint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a fact of life that this is what napkins do," says Terry Barbour of 
Nordstrom in Costa Mesa. "Not many people bring something to lay under their 
napkins." 
</P>
<P>
 The key? Carry a lint brush or roller in the glove compartment to clean up 
after lunch and, before you leave the restaurant, give a quick, subtle brush 
with your hand to remove any large, white pieces.

FOR WHISKERS ONLY; WHETHER AIMING FOR A DIFFERENT LOOK OR A BETTER MATCH, MEN 
ARE USING NEW GELS TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF THEIR BEARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM KISSEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Dave Cordova decided to change his look, he drove past the mall and 
beyond the hair salon to the corner drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just easier, and cheaper, to change the color of my beard and mustache 
than it is to go out and buy a new outfit," says Cordova, a Los Angeles 
hairdresser whose mustache and goatee have gone from purple to blond to black 
in the last 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 David K. (his professional name), an L.A. wardrobe stylist, went for a less 
drastic change, coloring his neatly trimmed mustache and beard a rich shade of 
brown. "It has a lot of attitude and gives some character to my face," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Over-the-counter, shampoo-in products formulated for facial hair -- everything 
from mutton chops and French forks to handlebars, goatees, beards and sideburns 
-- are expected to be the biggest thing in men's hair care since Grecian 
Formula. After all, 42.5% of American men cultivate some form of facial hair, a 
recent study by the Home Testing Institute shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Although primarily a fashion statement, the penchant for growing whiskers may 
have deeper roots, experts say. "Most men probably don't know they are sending 
signals of maturity, competence and sexual prowess when they grow facial hair," 
explains Helen Fisher, an anthropologist and author of the book "Anatomy of 
Love." Fisher also suggests that there is a correlation between a man's beard 
thickness and his testosterone level. "It acts as a signal to females that the 
male is not only virile but mature and ready to take on the world and fight off 
danger." 
</P>
<P>
 With so much at stake, no wonder many guys go to the trouble of using hair 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our market research told us that more men are growing facial hair today, and 
many are seeing their first gray hairs as early as 25, or earlier," says 
Dominic DeMain, group vice president for Combe Inc., the White Plains, N.Y., 
maker of Grecian Formula 16 and Just for Men Shampoo-in Haircolor. "In fact, 
many men won't grow facial hair because it tends to come in with gray, or red, 
or it just doesn't match the hair on their heads at all." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Combe and a handful of other companies have developed products 
aimed squarely at men's chins. Combe's Just for Men Brush-In Color Gel for 
Mustache, Beard & Sideburns sells for about $5.69 in grocery and discount 
drugstores. Its biggest competitor is Men's Choice by Clairol, a $5.49 gel that 
works on beards and head hair. Another entry, Dark & Natural by Carson 
Products, is designed for African American men. 
</P>
<P>
 Brush-In Color Gel and Men's Choice offer color in the form of thick gels that 
promise not to drip and not to leave any color buildup. They also promise to 
work in less than five minutes, a claim expected to lure a new category of 
users: men who have eschewed hair colors because they feel awkward standing 
around with chemicals on their heads or beards for 30 minutes or more.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, many men remain skeptical of hair colors, particularly those promising 
a quick fix, says Ross Goldstein, president of Generations Insight, a San 
Francisco company that tracks trends among baby boomers. For such a product to 
attract a man, he says, "Number one, it has to work, and secondly, it has to be 
fast, convenient and easy to use. In that order."

A WAY TO SAVE TIME, MONEY ON DYE JOBS?; HAIR CARE: COLOR-ENHANCING SHAMPOOS AND 
CONDITIONERS PROMISE TO OFFSET FADING EFFECTS. BUT THEY DON'T DO WONDERS FOR 
THE TINT OR TEXTURE OF TRESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new color-enhancing shampoos and conditioners seem just right for the 
'90s. They promise to make busy women who dye their hair less dependent on the 
salon, or the Loving Care, by offsetting the fading effects of sun and shampoo 
between treatments. Some women swear by them. But others wonder if the 
potential savings in time and money is worth the extra hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 In evaluating whether these products will work for you, take note of what they 
do and don't do. Enhancers won't cover roots or gray. Instead, they are 
designed to add color to hair previously treated with permanent color, helping 
to blend ends and roots between treatments. They are temporary and contain no 
peroxide, but they can stain tubs, towels and even hands. And, as the labels 
warn, they may irritate sensitive skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are my impressions of a sampling of enhancers I recently put to the test 
on my fine, curly, easily fried, blondish hair. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clairol Color Hold ColorRefresher, 4 ounces, $4.49 in drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the enhancers have serious staining capability, this one left 
scarcely any visible color on the tub, so I used my ivory-colored towels with 
confidence. Nary a stain resulted. After a quick blow dry, my hair felt soft 
and smooth, and looked very shiny. I carefully searched for newfound gold on my 
ends and thought I saw some, but no one commented on a change in my hair's 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 J.F. Lazartigue Colour Reflecting Hair Conditioner, 3.4 ounces, $31 at the 
J.F. Lazartigue shops in Beverly Hills and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about indulgent. Between the steep price tag and the directions 
stipulating that the creamy, pearlized, honey-colored mixture be left on the 
head for anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, I felt totally decadent using this 
product. (Pardon me while I postpone my life, I thought to myself as I waited 
for the minimum time to lapse.) What the product lacked in color effect 
(negligible), it more than made up for in its conditioning ability. My hair 
emitted a shine, even from the slightly enhanced split ends that appeared 
mended. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Mitchell Creatives Color Infusing Shampoo, 8 ounces, $9.95 at beauty 
salons. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the products I tried, this one appeared to have the most color in it. I 
applied the prescribed small amount, whipped my hair into a frenzied lather and 
waited five minutes before rinsing. It stung my eyes. My newly tinted tresses 
were a tangled web when I finished, so I applied conditioner, as the bottle 
suggested. Although that helped, I wasn't nearly as pleased with the texture of 
my hair as I was with its slightly more golden color. 
</P>
<P>
 Mastey Colour Refreshing Shampoo, 8 ounces, $8 at beauty salons. 
</P>
<P>
 This shampoo is by far the gentlest to the hair of all the non-conditioning 
enhancers I tried. It was possible to use the product without following up with 
a conditioner. It blended the roots with my over-processed ends, and I was 
satisfied with the texture of my hair, but I still needed a dye job in the 
worst way. 
</P>
<P>
 Aussie Intermissions Color Enhancing Shampoo, 10 ounces, $4.99 at drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
 The most affordable of the shampoo enhancers I tried, this one was also the 
most problematic. I applied the shampoo to my palms as suggested, but a bit ran 
down the side of my already wet tub and stained it to the point that I had to 
get out the Ajax. Because the label suggested a second application, I repeated 
the process immediately. I noticed a marked difference in the color, but I was 
unhappy with the strawlike texture of my hair, even after an application of 
conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In my experience, the new color enhancers have a long way to go. They seem too 
weak to reduce the frequency of color appointments, as a Roux rinse can. And 
because some of them are nearly as messy as a rinse and seem to wreak havoc 
with already taxed tresses, the effort isn't worth the side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 With the money saved forestalling a salon appointment, you may have to invest 
in a deep conditioner. For now, the best bet may be a combination of enhancers: 
I may try the Mastey shampoo and follow it with either the Lazartigue or 
Clairol conditioners.

SCREEN STYLE / BETTY GOODWIN: A SPANISH ACCENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "Belle Epoque." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: In the spring of 1931, a young Spanish soldier (Jorge Sanz, 
pictured) deserts the army and befriends a painter and his beautiful daughters; 
he becomes sexually entangled with all four women. A Spanish movie directed by 
Fernando Trueba, "Belle Epoque" is an Oscar nominee for best foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Lala Huete, who has designed costumes for several films 
and television series in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "When he imagined the film, Fernando (Trueba) talked a lot about 
Renoir's 'A Day in the Country,' Huete said. "That was the concept -- the fresh 
air, the joy, the movement, the sexuality, the light. I used that freedom to 
move through different time periods with the clothes. All the film is about 
that -- freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Fans of vintage clothing will soak up the wispy, drop-waist floral 
dresses; handsome silk blouses with unusual collars and buttons, and 
elaborately embroidered hand-me-down wedding gowns. Each sister -- Clara 
(Miriam Diaz-Aroca), Luz (Penelope Cruz, pictured), Rocio (Maribel Verdu) and 
Violeta (Ariadna Gil) -- is as best-dressed as the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Huete evokes a pastoral yet modern style by breaking rules and freely 
borrowing ideas and shapes from the '20s through the '30s. Although most 
countrywomen of the time dressed strictly in dark colors, the sisters wear 
yummy pastels, and their hemlines wander from just below the knee to mid-calf. 
Violeta is the most fashion forward in her wide trousers and menswear-inspired 
shirts. As Huete pointed out, "At that time, only maybe five women in the 
country wore trousers and they were either painters or intellectuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: The myriad varieties of satin bras, culottes and nightgowns -- not the 
frilly sort, but simple and luxuriant. 
</P>
<P>
 Details: The Spanish twist on fashion is unmistakable in heaps of espadrilles 
(worn while frolicking through the country), lace mantillas and wedding veils, 
and handmade crocheted sweaters and dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: Photos of Spain's early "intellectual" and sports women of the 
time, fashion magazines such as Vogue and Blanco y Negro, paintings by Jose 
Gutierrez Solana. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: The sisters' clothing, lingerie and accessories were either newly 
designed or purchased from antique shops in Madrid, London and Paris. 
Espadrilles were custom-made in Madrid.

BEHIND THE SCENES; SPRING SUITS BOTH MODELS AND GUESTS JUST FINE IN 'FANTASY' 
PREVIEW BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The grand ballroom of the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point was the setting for a 
sweeping fashion show that displayed something for everyone -- from casual to 
couture. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth annual "Fashion Fantasy" spring preview show last week benefited 
the Health Resources Center of the Women's Pavilion at South Coast Medical 
Center in Laguna Beach.It was sponsored by the Laguna Niguel Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 450 people in the audience were outfitted to match the models: 
Hats and light-colored spring suits were on show, on and off the runways. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel stores participating in the show were Casual Lifestyles, 
Champagne, Chez Joey New & Nearly New Designer Clothing, Fullers for Men & 
Women, Just Clever, Mel's Boutique, Meryl Jeran Couture, Mi Place, Nancy's 
Merry-Go-Round, Something Moore, T J Maxx, T. Stephens & Company and Vogue 
Alley. Salon Salon in Monarch Beach styled the models' hair for the 
fund-raiser.

 I'll confess to a certain prejudice, only because it will enhance my eventual 
conclusion. I don't read Redbook magazine, its jazzy advertising campaign about 
modern women who juggle notwithstanding, because I think of it in terms of the 
old Redbook -- all home and hearth, lots of recipes centered on convenience 
foods and fashion spreads reminiscent of the fabulous '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfair of me, I'm sure, but then, that's what prejudice is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 So I wasn't too excited about "This Old Heart of Mine," a collection of 
stories that appeared in Redbook between 1964 and 1991. I know Redbook has a 
reputation for exceptional short fiction, but still: I didn't expect much from 
a collection of stories about Janet and Danny, who, as you might expect, go 
from being young folks in love to grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest stories are interesting bits of social history, fragments of the 
pre-Betty Friedan era, when men were graduate students and women were 
hard-working wives until they got promoted to be penny-pinching, stay-at-home 
mothers. At the time, they might have made some readers feel better about their 
own frustrations, since Janet tended to gripe and fret more than her share.  
</P>
<P>
 But hindsight is always 20-20, and a reader today will see immediately that 
Janet is uncomfortable with her plight -- and has good reason to be. 
</P>
<P>
 In a word, the woman is a crank -- resentful, angry, anxious, depressed, upset 
with her subservient plight and her self-indulgent husband. She's working her 
derriere off, waking before the heat goes on and barely getting home to cook 
dinner, and he's enjoying his morning coffee before he heads to the library to 
do the research she's sure he isn't finishing fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
 If this was a nonfiction history, I doubt Janet and Danny would have made it 
past the first kid; they'd be a divorce statistic by now. The odd advantage to 
fiction, though, is that Merrill Joan Gerber can make them stay together, can 
force the long view upon them, even if they blow it short term. So they grow, 
and the writer grows with them, and by the time the kids are old enough to go 
to the zoo even the most cynical of readers is hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 What Gerber grows into is subtlety -- an ability not just to chart Janet's and 
Danny's ups and downs but to convey the shadings of emotion they experience on 
the way from one to another. 
</P>
<P>
 The story about the zoo trip is particularly surprising: Any mom who's ever 
wished for 10 seconds to herself will empathize with Janet's frustrating 
morning, getting the kids ready for a jaunt she doesn't want to take, only to 
find that her husband has gotten distracted and thrown the whole outing into 
scheduling jeopardy.  
</P>
<P>
 We're right there with her when she explodes, and announces her intention 
simply to stay home and relax. What's surprising is what happens when she gets 
her wish. If the outcome seems a little pre-modern (I imagine a larger 
percentage of moms today, many of whom work besides, might actually take the 
free time and figure out how to cope with their feeling of abandonment), Gerber 
does bring the reader up short. For all of a mom's complaining, part of the 
time-strain problem is that she usually does want to be with the kids. This 
story looks at just how fierce, and irrational, that yearning can be. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not suggesting that we have early Updike here, those glorious stories that 
demanded reading and rereading, whose physical descriptions often seemed to 
reach up off the page and form a third dimension. 
</P>
<P>
 There is not the economy of style that makes Joyce Carol Oates' work so 
stunning. Some of the earliest stories, in particular, cry out for just another 
rewrite, for a moment's more consideration; Gerber knew well enough what she 
was up to, even at the beginning, to be self-assured -- and the moments when 
she faltered stand out in relief. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gerber's stories have a synergistic advantage; they mean more gathered 
together than any of them would have alone. The collection is worthwhile 
because it is so unusual -- because it allows the reader to see both how the 
characters and their creator have grown over time. It's rare that we get to see 
so lasting, and focused, a relationship.

AFTER 6 YEARS, LEAR'S WILL FOLD WITH PUBLICATION OF APRIL ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frances Lear, owner and founder of Lear's, announced Thursday that the New 
York City-based magazine will cease publication after the April issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Lear began her magazine in 1988, directing it toward intelligent, mature women 
who were looking for more than fashion and beauty stories in a women's 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed a magazine could hold up a mirror for women over 40 and raise 
their self-image. Lear's made older women visible in a culture that overlooked 
them," Lear said in her farewell address. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's circulation reached 503,000 last year, but it was plagued with 
advertising difficulties. As a single publication, Lear's was unable to match 
the attractive group advertising rates offered by its Conde Nast competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lear does not plan to abandon her audience, just her medium. Her next venture 
is videotapes. Lear Television's first video subject, scheduled for summer 
release, is women and money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future is in direct-marketing products to a mass audience of women 
through advanced telecommunications," Lear said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lear's staff will remain on the payroll until March 25. Caroline Miller, 
Lear's former editor-in-chief, left last month to become editor of Seventeen 
magazine. GAILE ROBINSON

THE TONYA AND NANCY LURKING WITHIN US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN SHOALES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; San Francisco-based humorist Ian Shoales 
does regular features for Weekend Edition each Sunday on KCRW-FM in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The epic Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan tale is behind us, joining other brief 
blips on the screen of human history. I think I've isolated its significance, 
and its ultimate meaning. Our fascination with Tonya and Nancy is nothing less 
than the yearning for our own psychic dualities to be merged. 
</P>
<P>
 See if these helpful comparisons don't strike a chord: TONYA is to NANCY as 
Freud is to Jung, as bowling is to golf, Joan Crawford to Katharine Hepburn, 
Nixon to Kennedy, beer to lite beer, macaroni to spaghetti, Fox to PBS, or 
cigarettes to nonsmoking. Tonya is to Nancy as a doughnut to a bagel, TV to 
movies, domestic violence to divorce, a dirt road to the information 
superhighway, a Chevy to a Volvo, John Belushi to Chevy Chase, an angry shout 
to a muffled sob, an all-beef hot dog to a turkey frank, a convenience store to 
a clothing store, or Tommy Lee Jones to Rickie Lee Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 It's AM to FM, Irving Berlin to Cole Porter, cheeseburger to cottage cheese, 
United States to Canada, K Mart to Target, Vegas to Disney World, Africa to 
South America, malt liquor to ale, 7 & 7 to margarita, dim piano bar to karaoke 
bar, World War I to World War II, crack to cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya might be addiction, and Nancy habit, but if Tonya is habit, Nancy is 
cold turkey. If Tonya is cold turkey, Nancy is a 12-step program, but if Tonya 
is a 12-step program, then Nancy has always been a teetotaler. If Tonya has 
always been a teetotaler, Nancy is an addict currently working on her memoirs 
at the Betty Ford Center. If Tonya is the Betty Ford Center, then Nancy is a 
health-care professional. 
</P>
<P>
 If Tonya were Arsenio, Nancy would be Letterman. Yet if Tonya were Letterman, 
then Nancy would be Leno, and if Tonya were Leno, Nancy would be Ted Koppel. 
The irresistible force, the immovable object. Space, time, yard sale, estate 
sale, wink, nod. Which is the blind horse? We're talking rayon and silk here, 
felony and misdemeanor, passionate affair and guilt-ridden adultery, 
Jean-Claude Van Damme and Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lewis and Martin, Kansas and 
Oz, House and Senate, lust and desire, desire and love, losing and winning 
(relatively). 
</P>
<P>
 We're looking at gaps as small as the difference between "McGyver" and "Star 
Trek" or "Mission: Impossible" and "Star Trek: the Next Generation." The Nancy 
within likes any title with a colon in it, yet it's the Tonya inside who 
rejoices at sequels! We can be either one at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Feel like ordering a pizza? You're indulging your Tonya. Some Thai food might 
hit the spot? That's Nancy talking. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the Jacksons? Interest in the Jackson family is certainly 
Tonya-esque. Yet if La Toya is Tonya, then Nancy is Michael, if Tonya is 
Michael, then Nancy is the Jackson Family, and if Tonya is the Jackson Family, 
Nancy is the Jackson Five. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is Partridge Family, which is Brady Bunch? We will never be content 
until we learn to marry the Tonya and Nancy inside. 
</P>
<P>
 So many of us despair before we've even begun. There's no blame in this. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, if Tommy Lee Jones did marry Rickie Lee Jones, she'd still be 
Rickie Lee Jones, even if she kept her maiden name. Think about it.

FILLMORE MAY RESCUE DAMAGED THEATER; REPAIRS: ENCOURAGED BY RESTLESS CHILDREN 
AND DETERMINED RESIDENTS, OFFICIALS NOW HOPE TO SAVE WHAT LOCALS CALL 'THE 
SHOW.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 12-year-old Raelene Rodriguez and her sixth-grade friends, the Fillmore 
Theater was the thing to do, the place to see and be seen on Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The restrooms were rundown, and some seats were broken, and there were spider 
webs and stuff, but every week there was a good movie," Raelene said. "That's 
where I had most of my fun." 
</P>
<P>
 When January's earthquake hit Fillmore, causing $250 million in devastation, 
what parts of the aging theater that did not immediately hit the ground 
sustained major structural damage. Today, a jagged brick roof line and a 
replicated art Deco marquee peek over the scaffolding that nearly shrouds the 
shuttered theater and its neighbors on hard-hit Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss it a lot," Raelene said. "Now, I just stay home, or maybe go to Santa 
Paula with my parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, city officials have said the building might be damaged beyond 
repair -- even if enough money could be raised to reconstruct it. But 
encouraged by restless children and determined residents, officials are now 
leading the effort to save what locals call "The Show." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Fillmore's Redevelopment Agency sent an offer to the building's 
owner to buy the property for an undisclosed price. If the offer is accepted, 
the agency would determine whether the building can be salvaged and how much 
that would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the theater is an historic building, it cannot be demolished until a 
structural engineer's report is sent to the state historic preservation office. 
City Manager Roy Payne and other city officials hope the state office tells 
them the building is worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater now belongs to longtime Fillmore resident Dale Larson. But Larson, 
who fulfilled a lifelong dream when he purchased the theater two decades ago, 
says that at age 76 he's in no position to start over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said if Larson accepts the offer, the city would not mind shouldering 
the costs of operating the theater with a corporation or nonprofit agency. A 
growing assortment of locals -- banding together under the name "Save the Show" 
-- say they are eager to assist in the city's search for business partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Socially, how many things are there to do in this town?" said John McKinnon, 
one of the local residents who is trying to keep the theater open. "It's like 
an anchor. It's been there forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the theater has been there for 77 years. Dorothy Haase, executive 
director of the Fillmore Historical Museum, said the Barnes Theater, as it was 
first known, opened for business Oct. 2, 1916. The owner, Merton Barnes, 
himself a vaudeville man, booked vaudeville acts, speakers and stage plays in 
addition to movies at what one county newspaper termed "the finest theater in 
the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Decorated in "cream white and soft green," the theater boasted about 500 seats 
with "lazy back tilts" and a trap door in the stage for disappearing acts, 
according to newspaper advertisements and documents from the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a railroad town," Dale Larson explained. "The vaudeville troops would 
come in by rail, perform at the theater, and stay over at the Fillmore Hotel." 
Like the movie theater, the hotel also suffered grave earthquake damage. It was 
demolished last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater changed hands many times before Dale and Marilyn Larson purchased 
it 23 years ago, determined to revamp the aging cinema and make a living out of 
showing motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband always wanted to have his own little movie theater," said Marilyn 
Larson, now in her late 50s. "He always worked in (theaters) when he was a 
youth." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, after Dale Larson retired from the aerospace industry, the 
couple moved from an Orange County suburb to Fillmore with their two daughters 
and the deed to a rather dilapidated theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked all summer on it," Marilyn Larson remembered. "We put everything we 
had into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Because she loved the look of the Ahmanson Theater in downtown Los Angeles, 
the couple set out to imitate it in Fillmore, painting the theater's interior 
walls black, hanging red velour curtains over the screen and reupholstering the 
seats in the same red velour. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days out of seven they worked at the business of running the only movie 
theater for 25 miles around. "We booked our own movies and we were as selective 
as we could be," Marilyn Larson said. Wholesome movies fared best. "We played 
as many Gs as we could, many PGs, and very few Rs. It's a family town. You play 
a Disney, you pack the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, the couple sold the business end to Harold Graves, a local 
resident, though they retained ownership of the property itself. Graves could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, the Larsons have given the city permission to demolish the 
theater if necessary. Dale Larson had still not received the purchase offer 
from the city by Thursday, but said he would happily take a look at it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, various local residents are hatching plans to assist the city 
if Larson does sign on the dotted line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a dying piece of Americana there," said Wendy Basil, a former 
Hancock Park resident who, charmed by Fillmore's size and quaint atmosphere, 
bought a nearby ranch a month before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Basil and her husband, John Lockhart, both public relations executives in 
Los Angeles, are trying to persuade a large theater corporation to help revive 
the movie house. Undaunted by the scheduled fall opening of a seven-screen 
theater in nearby Santa Paula, Basil and Lockhart believe they can sell the 
project to a theater chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband and I were kind of jaded city people and this was kind of stepping 
back in time," she said, recalling her one visit to the theater a week before 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents hope to persuade one or more of the community's wealthier 
residents to invest a slice of their assets in the effort, or perhaps create a 
nonprofit organization that would eventually own and operate the cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Newman, a local screenwriter, searched for the words to describe why he 
cares so much about one building's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to describe if you're used to going to mall theaters," he said. 
"But it had a small-town feel."

COUNCIL AGAIN BACKS FACTORY OUTLET COMPLEX; DEVELOPMENT: MEMBERS OVERRIDE 
APPEALS OF PLANNING COMMISSION VOTE THAT APPROVED THE 22-ACRE CAMARILLO 
PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo City Council -- for the second time in 14 months -- has rejected 
appeals of the Planning Commission's approval of a factory outlet mall and 
given its formal blessing to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 After a sometimes tense four-hour public hearing during which council members 
questioned the motives of appeals filed by the Oxnard Union High School 
District and Camarillo resident John Johs, the council voted unanimously late 
Wednesday to approve the facility. The 22-acre project will be south of the 
Ventura Freeway between Carmen Drive and Las Posas Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A third appeal, filed by Ventura County, was withdrawn Wednesday after county 
officials said they were satisfied that road improvements to be built in 
conjunction with the mall could handle the extra traffic generated by the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose said he remained convinced that the project was 
thoroughly researched and would benefit the city. The council first voted 
unanimously for the project in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have absolutely no qualms about this project," Gose said. "I believe this 
will benefit our community. The presentation tonight by our staff made my 
decision one of the easier ones that I've had to make recently." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the council's decision, Camarillo is lagging behind Oxnard in a race 
to build the county's first factory outlet mall. While the Camarillo project 
will not break ground until July, the Oxnard project, about five miles away 
between Rose and Rice avenues, is already well under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo project has faced a host of bureaucratic and legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1993, after the project was first approved by the Planning 
Commission, the council heard appeals and voted to uphold the commission's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, however, Oxnard developer Stephen Maulhardt and retired Camarillo 
businessman Richard Lundberg filed a Superior Court lawsuit charging that city 
officials had failed to assess the project's full environmental impact. Last 
summer, a judge ordered a full environmental impact review and ruled that a 
proposed tax rebate to the developer, Los Angeles-based Koll Co., amounted to a 
gift of public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the legal setback, the developers continued with plans to build the 
mall. Camarillo officials, calculating that the mall would generate between 
$400,000 and $475,000 annually in sales tax revenues for the city, agreed to 
pay for the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 After the environmental review was published in late 1993, the developers 
asked the commission to reconsider the proposal, which the commission again 
approved. A few days after that, the three most recent appeals were filed, 
forcing the matter back before the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Wednesday's vote, the council questioned the motives of the appellants. 
Oxnard school officials based their appeal on a claim that the district would 
be adversely impacted by the numbers of families with school-age children that 
the project would draw to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city planning and legal staff members said the project will 
contribute the maximum amount of development fees to the district allowed by 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials declined to comment on the decision Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 When the council considered Johs' appeal, members questioned why he objected 
to the project on the basis of its impacts on traffic and the Oxnard school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael Morgan asked Johs why he was registered to vote in Oxnard 
and has his automobile registered there if he claims to be a Camarillo 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Johs responded that he was legitimately concerned about the project's impacts 
on the school district and traffic, and accused the council of engaging in 
"character attacks." 
</P>
<P>
 After Johs was asked by Morgan whether his mother, Ann Johs, had once served 
as an Oxnard City Council member and president of the Oxnard Chamber of 
Commerce, Johs accused the council of raising a personal line of questioning 
that had no bearing on his right to appeal the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a legal resident of Camarillo," Johs said. "There is nothing politically 
motivated about what I am doing here." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the lengthy hearing was taken up by consultant and staff readings of 
the environmental impact report. After the hearing, the council uniformly 
praised the project and quickly approved it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very concerned about people's motives in this situation," Morgan said. 
"But regarding the mall itself, I have no questions. The staff report answered 
them all. I'm happy with this project." 
</P>
<P>
 Koll Co. spokesman Peter Tilton said he was pleased with the council's 
decision and its support of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are definitely encouraged," he said. "We remain confident this project 
will be good for our company and partners, and good for the city." NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 Despite possible legal challenges, the Camarillo Factory Outlet Mall 
groundbreaking has been tentatively set for July. Completion of the first of 
two phases planned for the 22-acre development is expected by late fall, 
officials said. Tenants for the 250,000-square-foot mall have not been 
announced.

SUSPECT IN FATAL SHOOTING OF SIMI MAN CHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors on Thursday charged a 19-year-old Port Hueneme man with murder, 
robbery, cruelty to an animal and a special circumstance that could send him to 
the gas chamber in the shooting deaths of a Simi Valley man and his dog. 
</P>
<P>
 And friends of his alleged victim -- Andrew Anderson -- clapped, jeered and 
yelled insults as a judge denied bail to defendant Timothy Chrestman, an 
unemployed fish-boat laborer whose only other brush with the law was for 
possessing marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman is charged with fatally shooting the 24-year-old Anderson and 
Anderson's dog in the mountains above Ojai on March 4 in order to steal the 
victim's pickup truck, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chrestman's arraignment Thursday, about two dozen friends of the victim -- 
including his 22-year-old girlfriend, Lori Quinn -- clapped loudly at the 
judge's decision to deny bail. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chrestman dropped his head in apparent frustration and began walking out 
of court, some in the crowd screamed insults at him. 
</P>
<P>
 A bailiff rushed over and ordered them from the court. Anderson's parents did 
not attend the arraignment, which was continued until March 30 to give 
Chrestman's lawyers time to review police reports and other evidence against 
their client. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman's parents were seated a row behind the supporters of their son's 
alleged victim. When the clapping began, Chrestman's mother dropped her head 
and began to sob. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chrestman family has received some threats to their safety since Timothy 
Chrestman's arrest, Deputy Public Defender Brian Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzpatrick said Judge Bruce Clark should not have tolerated the outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obviously improper to do that kind of stuff," Fitzpatrick said, adding 
that the judge "should not allow that to happen without admonishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Anderson's girlfriend, Quinn, said she was happy that the judge 
denied bail to Chrestman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope he stays in jail forever," said Quinn, tears welling up in her 
eyes. Quinn said she and Anderson had dated for three years and planned on 
marrying, perhaps in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to be Andy's mother-in-law," said Lori's mother, Cathy Quinn. "We 
were looking forward to that, and now it's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Quinn said she wants Chrestman to be convicted of the maximum penalty and 
to receive the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want life without parole or the death penalty," she said of Chrestman. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley said prosecutors have not decided 
whether to seek the death penalty in the case. But by filing the special 
circumstance that accuses the defendant of shooting Anderson while robbing him 
of his truck, they can seek the capital punishment for Chrestman, Frawley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman has one criminal conviction on his record, authorities said. He was 
found guilty of misdemeanor drug possession last year, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have said that Chrestman shot Anderson as he stood next to his 
truck preparing to drive home from his half-day fishing trip about noon March 
4. Frawley said Thursday that the victim was shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Chrestman then shot Anderson's dog -- Sheila, an 
Australian shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, described as an avid outdoorsman and a loyal friend, was last seen 
early March 4 when he left his parents' home in Simi Valley to go fishing in 
the Ojai area. He had planned to return by 2 p.m. and was scheduled to work at 
his job at Blue Cross of California in Westlake by 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At his job and at home, he had often mentioned how popular his 1990 4x4 Toyota 
pickup truck seemed to be with young people. The truck had a camper shell, a 
fresh blue paint job and new tire rims, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the carjackings that are going on, we had talked about it as a 
group" at work, said Anderson's supervisor, Sandy Hogsett. She and another 
co-worker also came to Chrestman's arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a very close-knit group," said Hogsett. "Yesterday, they had to close 
part of the office down, the part where Andy worked." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Anderson arrived at the campground the morning of March 4 for 
fishing, Chrestman had been at the remote site for two full days, said defense 
attorney Fitzpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman had been dropped off by his father, who planned to pick him up later 
that weekend, Fitzpatrick said. The defendant had camping gear and food with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 While Fitzpatrick said the motive in the case is a mystery, he does not 
believe it is robbery, as the district attorney has charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my understanding that the victim still had his wallet on him with his 
credit cards," Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's definitely a piece of the puzzle that's missing in my mind 
that's going to take further investigation," he said. "I don't think it's as 
black and white as the district attorney believes." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said Chrestman is not the type of person who should face the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything in his background at all that would justify that," he 
said. "This is a kid who has never before been in any serious trouble and 
suddenly he finds himself in these circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cathy Quinn, the mother of Anderson's girlfriend, said she often heard 
Anderson say he would never die fighting for his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told Lori that if someone ever wanted the truck, he would hand them the 
keys," she said.

D.A. CONSIDERS USING '3-STRIKES' LAW IN POT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY and JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors said Thursday that they are considering filing 
their first charges under the state's new "three-strikes-and-you're-out" law -- 
against an Oxnard man accused of cultivating seven marijuana plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston A. Shelton, 36, was arrested on suspicion of cultivating the plants 
only hours after the new law took effect Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 He may be eligible for prosecution under the new statute because he has at 
least two previous armed-robbery convictions, said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Kevin J. McGee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking into his background now," McGee said Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton was arrested at his home in the 1200 block of West Fir Street about 
7:30 p.m. Monday, Oxnard police spokesman David Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton's parole officer had received a tip that the defendant was cultivating 
marijuana in his garage, Keith said. The parole officer visited Shelton's home 
and, with backup from Oxnard patrol officers, searched the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers found the plants, some of them three feet tall, in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 If charged and convicted under the new law, Shelton would face a sentence of 
25 years to life. The statute prescribes such a sentence to anyone with two 
prior serious or violent felonies who commits any felony on a third offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton is being held in the Ventura County Jail without bail for violating 
the terms of his parole, authorities said. He is scheduled to appear in 
Superior Court on March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said Shelton's case presents local prosecutors with a dilemma because 
the latest incident appears to be relatively minor compared to his previous 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this was a violent felony or a serious felony that he had just been 
arrested on, in all likelihood we would be proceeding on the 
'three-strikes-and-you're-out' now," McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, however, Shelton is not charged with the specific allegation of 
violating the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee also said the new law gives prosecutors some discretion to not file 
enhanced charges if a defendant's third or final strike does not appear serious 
enough to merit a life term in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he said that could apply in a low-level felony case in which the 
defendant had been convicted of two serious or violent charges 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury has instructed his 
attorneys to file charges under the new law in cases that merit them, although 
the state district attorney's association did not support the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the law and we're going to do our best to make it work in Ventura 
County," McGee said. "There's no doubt we need a habitual offender statute."

OXNARD SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP OWN MATH TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frustrated with low scores on statewide assessment tests, Oxnard Elementary 
School District leaders have decided to develop their own eighth-grade math 
test that they say will be a better measure of their students' math abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's board of trustees voted 4 to 1 to retest the district's 
1,200 eighth-graders with the yet-to-be-developed exam that -- unlike the 
statewide test administered last year -- would quiz students in Spanish or 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's quiz would be given in addition to the California Learning 
Assessment Systems tests, in which state students were measured not against 
each other but according to performance standards set by a task force that 
included educators, school board members, business leaders, parents and testing 
experts. The tests were given last spring in grades four, eight and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said Oxnard is the first district they know of that has 
reacted to the California Learning Assessment Systems quiz by writing its own 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, district officials criticized the statewide test for failing to 
correctly assess basic math skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state test gives too much emphasis on reasoning and it fails to deal with 
basic arithmetic," District Supt. Norman R. Brekke said. "We need to know 
whether our students can do basic math." 
</P>
<P>
 About 42% of the district's students have limited English proficiency, trustee 
Mary Barreto said. Such students were at a disadvantage understanding questions 
dealing with reasoning on the English-only test, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 The board's move Wednesday came the same day the state released the results of 
the assessment tests, in which Oxnard's eighth-grade math scores ranked 14th 
out of the 17 districts in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the Oxnard school district scored below the state average in most 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The board may later decide to design new tests for all grades in writing, 
reading and math but decided to begin with the eighth-grade math tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to test our students to know where they are," trustee Jack T. Fowler 
said. "If we get good results in this test, we will try to implement tests in 
writing and reading for all grades." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler, who suggested to the board that the district implement its own test, 
said the state test does a good job in measuring students' abilities to solve 
problems but it fails to test basic skills.  
</P>
<P>
 "The state test has moved from specific questions and answers to more creative 
thinking," Fowler said. "We have to make sure first that students can handle 
basic math before problem-solving math." 
</P>
<P>
 The board directed the school district to put everything else aside and work 
on developing the test. Students should take the test within the next two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to four district math teachers will design the exam, which will include 
eight problems -- two each in subtraction, multiplication, division and 
addition, said Kathy Cooper, a school district employee in charge of developing 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will either hire an outside contractor to score the tests or rely 
on volunteers from the Parent Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 If the PTA volunteers score the tests, it will cost the district about $100 to 
develop and implement the test, Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no additional cost beyond $100, which would cover the paper 
supply to print the tests," Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
 District board Chairman James Suter, who voted against implementing the new 
test, agreed that the state assessment did not correctly evaluate students' 
abilities. But he said the board could obtain an assessment of students' 
performance through other means. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the board has to do is to ask the teachers," said Suter, who was a 
teacher for 35 years. "The teachers always know what their students can do 
because they always check through weekly quizzes or tests." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fowler said he cannot accept that district students are doing as badly as 
the state assessment results show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have confidence that our teachers are doing a good job and the students can 
do much better than they did in the state test," Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, if we don't do well in this test, then yes, we have a problem," Fowler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Oxnard schoolteachers agreed that the statewide test does not reflect the 
students' math skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids can do better with basic math than they did in the state test," said 
Barbara McFayden, an eighth-grade math teacher at Fremont Intermediate School. 
"They need to be tested on what they have been taught."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SCIENCE FAIR TESTS STUDENTS' CREATIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many of the students at Mesa Junior High School in Somis, the hardest part 
of entering a project in their school science fair was to come up with an 
interesting idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where they make that creative leap," said Debby Dunn, a science 
teacher at Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the eighth-grade girl who won the grand prize in the science fair at 
Mesa this week, finding a topic was no problem: She got the idea from her 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, 14-year-old Michaela Vanoni said, one of the more difficult parts 
about her experiment was just waiting to see the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaela, one of several Mesa students who will go on to the Ventura County 
Science Fair next month, wanted to answer one question: Will water hyacinths 
act as a biological filter? 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother had read in a magazine that the plants could filter pollutants from 
dirty water, acting as a sort of natural decontaminant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michaela had to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 After doing the initial work of filling two buckets with dirty ditch water and 
two with clean well water, and then putting hyacinth plants in each, all she 
could do was wait. 
</P>
<P>
 First she waited several weeks for the plants to do their work. Then she had 
to wait for results from the lab where she had the water samples tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was suspenseful," she said. "I had to wait until the test came to see if 
my project worked." 
</P>
<P>
 It did. And Michaela said she's excited to take her results to the Ventura 
County Science Fair on April 19-21. 
</P>
<P>
 All sixth- through eighth-grade students at Mesa are required to do science 
projects. But not all are able to come up with their own topics or lucky enough 
to have their parents suggest ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 For these children, Dunn said she has books giving different ideas for science 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best ideas are not found in books, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones that come out of the books are more cookbook-y and they're not as 
original," Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, students who win the Mesa science fair are those with the most 
original ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the first-place winner in the medical science category this year 
was Chellie Moore, whose project examined whether people who suffer from asthma 
are able to exercise better when they use inhalers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she has asthma herself, Chellie performed exercises for her experiment 
and also enlisted help from her brother and several classmates. Her conclusion: 
Inhalers help. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Dunn said, the eighth-grade student has to do a follow-up experiment to 
find what type of inhalers work best. MAIA DAVIS

 In honor of Arbor Day, local garden clubs will host free tours and talks in 
the Conejo Valley Botanic Garden in Thousand Oaks on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 After two tree-planting ceremonies -- scheduled for 1 p.m. and 2 p.m -- 
members of the Conejo Valley and Westlake garden clubs will take visitors 
through the Botanic Garden, showing them an orchard of rare fruit trees, a 
butterfly garden and many varieties of native plants. 
</P>
<P>
 A family tour is scheduled for 3 p.m., and a general tour will start at 3:30 
p.m.. Both begin at the garden entrance off Gainsborough Road between Lynn and 
Moorpark roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights include the more than 60 unusual fruit trees, including sapote (a 
light green fruit that tastes like pudding), capulin cherries (which look like 
supermarket cherries but have a different flavor) and cherimoya (which taste 
like a cross between pineapple and banana). 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the offbeat trees will not be in bloom, but an expert will be on hand 
to answer questions, said Andrea Hager, a member of the rare fruit growers 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 Club members are hoping the events will help raise public awareness of the 
Botanic Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more crowds have been coming to the garden, more and more families," 
said Carmen Oblinger, who volunteers at the Botanic Garden. "People are 
starting to get the message." STEPHANIE SIMON

 Sheriff's deputies have arrested two Moorpark residents on suspicion of 
assaulting or intimidating a 13-year-old witness in the rape of a 12-year-old 
girl, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Mendez, 18, was taken into custody March 2 and released from County 
Jail on Tuesday.She was charged March 4 with threatening a witness, a 
misdemeanor, and is scheduled to appear March 21 for a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Morales, 21, was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of threatening the 
same witness. He was being held without bail in County Jail for allegedly 
violating the terms of his parole and was scheduled to be arraigned today in 
Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests came after the 13-year-old boy told deputies that Morales punched 
him in the back of the head and Mendez threatened him with a knife, according 
to Sheriff's Sgt. Marty Rouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez is described as the girlfriend of Roberto Magdaleno, 22, who is accused 
of raping the 12-year-old Nov. 1 inside a recently constructed house, which was 
vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is scheduled to go to trial April 25, Deputy Dist. Atty. Rebecca Day

 Thousand Oaks business owners seeking recognition for their efforts to slash 
waste have until Tuesday to apply for the city's annual WasteWatch awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The program honors businesses, nonprofit organizations and schools that have 
found innovative ways to cut the amount of garbage they generate.Companies that 
help build the market for recyclables by buying largely recycled goods can also 
win an award. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the WasteWatch program is countywide, each city offers its own 
awards. The Thousand Oaks City Council will honor winners with a plaque at a 
council meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a regional program that's both pro-environment and pro-business," said 
Thousand Oaks' recycling coordinator Grahame Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many businesses in Thousand Oaks and Ventura County that have 
become waste-efficient," he said. "They benefit themselves by reducing trash 
costs and they benefit the environment too. We're prepared to recognize and 
promote them." STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AIRPORT MERGER PLAN RAISES CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 concerned pilots, airport business owners and aviation 
enthusiasts crowded into a County Government Center conference room Thursday 
for a meeting on proposed changes to the county's Department of Airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Called by Supervisor John K. Flynn, the meeting was held to discuss a proposed 
merger of the county's Department of Airports into the Public Works Department, 
and an idea to eliminate the post of airports administrator -- a position 
vacant since late last year when Marshall A. MacKinen resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, the first of several to be held on the subject, pilots 
expressed concerns that the merger would be harmful for the county's two 
airports in Oxnard and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do we want to change something if it already works?" asked Steve Barber, 
Confederate Air Force wing leader at Camarillo Airport. "If it's not broke, 
don't fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to county Public Works Director Arthur Goulet, the merger could 
save about $200,000 annually in the airport department's enterprise fund. 
Currently, the fund is valued at about $4.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn told the uneasy crowd that the proposal was still just a proposal and 
that no formal decisions on the airports will be made soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will end up meeting with you folks many times," Flynn said. "Remember, 
we're just talking about an idea here. Please try to keep your minds open."

 A popular downtown Ventura burger stand was temporarily closed after health 
inspectors discovered a roach infestation there, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Top Hat Burger Palace at 299 E. Main St. was closed for one day last month 
after the insects were spotted during a routine inspection, according to a 
county report.County health workers on Feb. 1 noticed roaches in the main food 
preparation area, including on the condiment table, the report says. The 
establishment was reopened the next day after the roaches were removed, 
according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Other closures for February: 
</P>
<P>
 * Carniceria Colima at 2746 Vineyard Ave. in Oxnard was closed several hours 
on Feb. 28 while owners cleaned up dirty water in a meat locker and cleaned an 
employee bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * J & S Produce at 3400 Los Angeles Ave. in Somis was closed on Feb. 28 and 
reopened the next day. Health officials cited the business for not having a 
toilet and hand sink available for employees, officials said. KAY SAILLANT

<P>
 A head-on collision injured three people, closed California 33 for an hour, 
and may have contributed to a second accident in Oak View, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the highway closed in both directions near Creek Road after the 2:30 p.m. 
accident, firefighters worked for nearly half an hour to extricate two people 
from their mangled pickup, county fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two victims were taken to Ojai Valley Community Hospital with serious 
injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A passenger from the other truck sustained minor injuries and was also taken 
to the Ojai Valley hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their conditions were not available late Thursday, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision occurred when one truck drifted across California 33 and slammed 
into an oncoming vehicle, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the crash, traffic was rerouted to Creek Road, where a 
motorcyclist sustained a broken leg in a second accident at 2:49 p.m., 
according to Ojai authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcycle accident may have been related to the increased traffic on 
Creek Road, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The names and hometowns of all the victims were withheld by the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 California 33 was reopened at 3:44 p.m. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BULLETPROOF GLASS FOILS BANK ROBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 43-year-old drifter attempted to rob a Wells Fargo bank in Ventura on 
Thursday morning, but he was stymied by bulletproof glass and arrested by 
police as he exited the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Rodderick Johnson was taken into custody by Ventura Police Officer Ross 
Nideffer about 9 a.m. in the parking lot of the Wells Fargo branch on South 
Chestnut Street.Witnesses told police they saw Johnson loitering in the area 
and fishing a cardboard box from a trash can before the bank opened. 
</P>
<P>
 He later entered the bank, approached a teller, placed the cardboard box on 
the counter and said: "This is a robbery, give me all your money," police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teller, protected by bulletproof glass, then tripped the silent alarm and 
sat down on the floor out of view. The bank manager called police and gave 
dispatchers a description of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Nideffer arrested Johnson at gunpoint without incident just as other officers 
were arriving as back up. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI Special Agent Larry Dick said Johnson later told him he wanted to get 
caught. "He was fed up with living on the street and having an alcohol problem 
and a drug problem, and he felt getting arrested possibly would help him get 
his life back together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson described himself as a self-taught artist and musician. JULIE FIELDS

QUAKE-DAMAGED SIMI LIBRARY TO REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR., SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After several delays, county officials said Thursday that the 
earthquake-damaged Simi Valley Library will reopen March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 And as an unscheduled bonus for patient patrons, the library will 
simultaneously become the only such facility in the county to offer fully 
automated checkout. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Langville, a manager with the Ventura County Library Services Agency, 
said damage to the large, concrete columns leading to the Tapo Canyon Road 
library caused the extended delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're doing right now is strengthening the columns," he said. "They 
were either damaged or weakened during the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the facility reopens, Langville said, the new self checkout computers 
will trim lines at the counter and allow the library to spread its staff 
thinner and stay open longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we intend to do is stretch the staffing out over a longer period of time 
so we can keep the library open more hours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 New hours, scheduled to go into effect April 4, will be 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Mondays through Thursdays and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Library hours between March 21 and April 4 will be noon to 8 p.m. Mondays and 
Tuesdays, 2 to 8 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays, and 1 to 5 p.m. Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the new system, residents will be able to check their books out 
electronically and leave with a receipt telling them when the items are due. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a system that has been going into libraries gradually around the 
country," Langville said. "The working models have actually only been in 
library buildings for less than a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Librarians will still be on duty, though, to aid in registration, paying fines 
or even checking out books the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said the city agreed to install the devices at 
a cost of about $75,000 to ensure longer library hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton also applauded the scheduled reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased that it's finally going to open," he said. "Obviously, it 
is something that the community wants and needs and has really missed." 
</P>
<P>
 One casualty of the reopening will be the bus-like bookmobile parked outside 
the library since the Jan. 17 quake. Although popular with residents as a 
temporary way to get access to books, Langville said the vehicle will be moved 
when the real doors reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted with how people have received the bookmobile," he said. "It's 
been a very popular thing out there, and the people have really been fascinated 
by the bookmobile and taken with it."

PLANNERS CANCEL PICNIC FOR CONEJO VALLEY DAYS; FESTIVITIES: THEY CITE THE COSTS 
OF THE OPENING EVENT, SAYING IT WAS EITHER ELIMINATE IT OR CUT BACK THE ACTUAL 
FIVE-DAY CELEBRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing financial problems, organizers of Conejo Valley Days have canceled a 
popular picnic, scheduled March 20, that traditionally had launched the spring 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands attended the picnic in past years, but it became too large a drain 
on the Conejo Valley Days budget, organizers said Thursday. The picnic costs 
the volunteer organizing committee $6,000, said Pete Turpel, Conejo Valley Days 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't feel comfortable about this," Turpel said of the cancellation. 
"Nobody feels good about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the giant picnic, volunteers are scrambling to put together a 
smaller event to fill the gap, said Bob Rickards, chairman of this year's grand 
marshal contest. If the plan comes together, the event would be put on by this 
year's two grand marshal contestants as a fund-raiser, Rickards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominees compete to raise the most money for charity to win the honor of 
presiding over the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller event would not have the array of food, souvenirs and beer booths 
as past picnics, Rickards said. But it would feature entertainment and serve as 
an opportunity for families to come together and celebrate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working on it," Rickards said. "The bottom line is we need to have a 
very low overhead." 
</P>
<P>
 In the giant picnic's heyday, as many as 4,500 residents turned out to eat 
chicken barbecued by the Conejo Valley Rotary and meet contestants for Conejo 
Valley Days grand marshal, said Steve Rubinstein, executive director of the 
Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no admission charge, but food and souvenirs were sold. The Rotary 
gave 5% of the proceeds from food sales to the Conejo Valley Days committee, 
but that only amounted to about $500, Turpel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, costs for park rental, insurance and security rose to $6,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our costs have gone up," Rubinstein said. "It's purely monetary." 
</P>
<P>
 The Western-style Conejo Valley Days festival will go on as scheduled April 27 
to May 1. It may even net a small profit to provide seed money to the volunteer 
committee that will take over festival planning after this year without the 
chamber's guidance, Turpel said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, only about 800 or 1,000 people have turned out for the 
picnic, as bad weather and shifting locations made it less appealing, Turpel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably weren't the best promoters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers did not realize until recently that they had underbudgeted 
expenses for this year's festival and had to find something to cut. The only 
other option was to cut two days from the festival's five-day run, Turpel said. 
</P>
<P>
 By axing the picnic, the organizing committee expects to keep its $465,000 
budget from spilling into the red, Turpel said. The cost of setting up the 
festival's beer and food tents, rides and commercial booths is made up with 
ticket sales and a percentage from concessions, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the festival lost money and the committee still is paying off 
that debt. For that reason, organizers had considered cutting the picnic for 
the past two years, but no one had the heart to do it, Turpel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we kept it was because it was such a tradition," he said.

SUPERVISOR URGES OAK PARK RESIDENTS TO SUPPORT ANNEXATION; COMMUNITIES: MARIA 
VANDERKOLK SAYS THOSE LIVING IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREA SHOULD VOTE ON JUNE 
ADVISORY BALLOT TO JOIN THOUSAND OAKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk is urging Oak Park residents to vote for 
annexation to Thousand Oaks in a June advisory ballot measure -- a position 
that has angered leaders of the unincorporated community. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure is intended to allow Oak Park residents an opportunity to 
state their preference from among three options: incorporation as an 
independent city, annexation to Thousand Oaks, or continuation as an 
unincorporated community. The results will not be binding on the Board of 
Supervisors or the Thousand Oaks City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council, an elected body that 
advises the county on Oak Park issues, said VanderKolk's decision circumvents 
the intent of the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The politicians should keep out of this and give a chance for the people to 
decide for themselves," said Ron Stark a longtime member of the council. "From 
what I know about Oak Park, this is the least attractive alternative. We don't 
want to be a part of Thousand Oaks and they don't want us. I think it's the 
worst idea in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said she was not circumventing voters. On the contrary, she said, 
it was she who first pushed for the ballot measure seeking voters' sentiments 
on the issue. She made her decision to write a ballot argument in favor of 
annexation purely out of fairness, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware of one individual arguing for incorporation, and I'm assuming the 
MAC (advisory council) is going to take a position," she said. "We needed 
someone in favor of annexation for balance, and I do believe that (annexation) 
is the best course of action." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk, who is not seeking reelection, emphasized that the vote will be 
purely advisory and will simply be used by her successor and the advisory 
council to determine Oak Park's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I have no idea what the people there want, and I don't think 
anyone else really does either," she said. "That's why we're doing the 
measure." 
</P>
<P>
 Two candidates vying to replace VanderKolk on the Board of Supervisors 
questioned her decision to argue for annexation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's an advisory vote, why take a position to influence the public when 
you're trying to gauge their opinion?" said Frank Schillo, a Thousand Oaks 
councilman running for supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo had argued against the ballot measure when VanderKolk brought it 
before supervisors in January. He said the $8,500 cost was a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Jere Robings, also running to replace VanderKolk when she leaves the board 
in January, 1995, said her decision does not reflect the desires of Oak Park 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no basis to understand why she decided in favor of annexation," he 
said. "I assume she's talked to the same people I have in the community, and of 
the hundreds of people I've talked to, annexation is the least favorable 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 But Madge L. Schaefer, another candidate for the supervisor's seat, said she 
had no quarrel with VanderKolk's decision to take a stand on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is that the people who are affected by this make the 
decision," Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor candidate Trudi K. Loh could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park leaders and county officials have been struggling for years to 
determine how best to provide basic services to the community of about 15,000 
just east of Thousand Oaks, said Dr. George Anterasian, another member of the 
Municipal Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Anterasian said the community has felt left out by the county, and has 
complained for years about a lack of community services. The three options 
presented on the ballot are considered the best alternatives to address that 
concern, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "All three options have their advantages and disadvantages. But there is no 
clear-cut best option. Most people that I know do not favor annexation," he 
said. "It is difficult to believe that the concerns of our small community 
would be well-addressed by a city of 100,000." 
</P>
<P>
 While the advisory council has struggled with the issue -- often criticizing 
VanderKolk and the county for allegedly ignoring its concerns -- it has made 
little progress toward solutions. A year ago, the panel recommended against 
incorporating as an independent city because it would require residents to pay 
higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said she decided to seek the ballot measure after years of 
frustration on how to solve Oak Park's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not happy with the status quo. They are like the county's 
unrecognized stepchildren. They don't get the same level of service of other 
cities," VanderKolk said. "But they want things, like a new ZIP code, that I 
can't give them. County budgets continue to shrink and I am just one voice on a 
board of five. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something has to change. The people have to make a choice about what to do."

COTTON LEADS MATER DEI TO VICTORY; PREP BASKETBALL: FRESHMAN SCORES 36 POINTS 
AS MONARCHS ADVANCE TO REGIONAL FINAL BY BEATING FRESNO BULLARD, 84-68. 
</P>

<P>
 Mater Dei's basketball team looked to the future and it looked bright. 
</P>
<P>
 Schea Cotton, the Monarchs' fab freshman, took his game to a higher level, 
leaving Fresno Bullard standing flat-footed Thursday. Cotton scored 36 points 
in a 84-68 victory at Ocean View High School that put Mater Dei in Saturday's 
Southern California Division I Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (33-0), ranked No. 2 in the nation by USA Today, will play 
Crenshaw (24-5), ranked fifth. Crenshaw defeated Mater Dei, 63-61, in last 
season's final. 
</P>
<P>
 That the Monarchs have another crack at Crenshaw is due mainly to Cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I see him play, he does something I've never seen before," Monarch 
guard Miles Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 What Cotton did this time was help the Monarchs avert disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton scored 18 points in the first half, when the Monarchs were struggling. 
The score was tied, 33-33, at halftime, but Bullard (25-4) was clearly pressing 
the issue while Mater Dei was stressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, the Monarchs' sharp-shooting senior, was having an off-night. He 
finished with 21 points, but made only seven of 19 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Shaun Jackson, who averages 14 points, spent the game in foul trouble 
and was scoreless at the half. Clay McKnight, a three-point specialist, 
couldn't seem to free up for a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 So that left Cotton, a tenderfoot when it comes to these sort of pressure 
games. But, on Thursday, ability, not experience, mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schea just put us on his shoulders," Monarch Coach Gary McKnight said. "Have 
you ever seen a freshman do that in a state playoff game?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton scored six consecutive points late in the second quarter to blunt a 9-2 
Bullard run and keep the Monarchs close. It was a preview of coming highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei put away the game with a 15-4 run to start the fourth quarter. 
Cotton scored eight of the points. 
</P>
<P>
 He dunked off a lob pass from McKnight on one possession. The next time down, 
Cotton went base line for another slam and the Monarchs led, 68-51, with 3 
minutes 54 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton made 14 of 19 shots, including six dunks, despite being double-teamed 
almost every time he touched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a lot more emotional out there tonight," said Cotton, who transferred 
from Bellflower St. John Bosco in December. "I felt I had to get hyped up. 
There was so much riding on this game." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the Monarchs seemed to catch that enthusiasm in the second half. 
Mater Dei scored 51 second-half points. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who picked up his third foul early in the second quarter, scored 11 
points in the second half. He had six during a four-minute stretch in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Shaun gets the ball around the post, he creates havoc," McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon caused a little chaos as well. Although he shot poorly, he had 11 
rebounds and smothered Bullard's Shannon Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who averages 21, scored 15, but made only five of 20 shots. The 
Monarchs also closed down center Kevin Swillis. He scored six points in the 
first five minutes, but scored only six more the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you got to find other ways to help the team," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, on Thursday, Cotton was the way.

DALY GETS BACK IN THE SWING; GOLF: HE SHOOTS 69 IN FIRST COMPETITIVE ROUND IN 
FOUR MOUTHS, TRAILS LEADERS BY TWO SHOTS IN FLORIDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>

<P>
 The two-iron shot flew high and straight, over the water and over the shiny 
new sponsor's car that had been set out on a platform in the middle of a little 
pond for maximum exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 It kept rising and rising, soaring much higher than two-irons are supposed to. 
Deflected only slightly by a warm Florida breeze, it cleared the five-foot 
waterfall easily and stopped dead on the 18th green, 30 feet from the hole and 
269 yards from where it had begun its flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery that had ballooned to perhaps 4,000 erupted in applause and 
squeals, oohs and aahs that echoed all over the course. 
</P>
<P>
 The word spread quickly: John Daly was back. 
</P>
<P>
 Two putts later, Daly had birdied the 585-yard par-five hole and finished his 
first competitive round of golf in four months with a two-under-par 69, putting 
him two shots behind co-leaders Bernhard Langer of Germany and Brandel Chamblee 
after the first round of the Honda Classic on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, all seemed well again on the PGA Tour. The prodigal son had 
returned. Detention had been served. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension of Daly, currently the best draw in golf unless Arnold Palmer 
or Jack Nicklaus happens to be in town, was over. Life amid the palm trees and 
fancy fairways was good again. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Blond Bomber from Memphis stalked off in a sulk in mid-round of a 
tournament in Hawaii last November, forcing PGA Commissioner Deane Beman to 
suspend him, the tour was left again with 200 guys named Mark who all hit nice 
five-irons to the green and who blend in the minds of the paying public like 
vanilla ice cream in a white dish.  
</P>
<P>
 From the moment Daly was given a last-second spot in the 1991 PGA 
Championship, and drove all night just to make his first tee time en route to 
winning the tournament, his celebrity has mushroomed remarkably. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of it is the public's fascination with a golfer who got drunk a lot, 
occasionally trashed his home, often squabbled with girlfriend-turned-wife both 
in private and public, went to drug rehab centers as frequently as others go to 
the dentist, and still came out week after week to thrill galleries with a 
special kind of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of it is that special kind of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about his memorable second shot on No. 18 Thursday, a shot that not 
only was terribly risky but also about 60 yards beyond the distance that most 
mortals can hit a two-iron, Daly said, "I had a great lie and it was downwind, 
so it probably only played about 240." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about other comparative shots, Daly mentioned a one-iron that he 
hit last year in the U.S. Open at Baltusrol. That one went 301 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of shot I remember," he said, as if 269-yard two-irons are what you 
do at the neighborhood pitch and putt. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, in his first round back, there was no easing into things. That's not 
Daly's style, and that's why the crowds love him. Except for the par-threes, he 
always out-drove his playing partners, Nick Faldo and Mike Hulbert. Daly 
usually viewed their second shots from 70-80 yards up the fairway. On the 
par-four 16th, a 440-yard hole, a couple of course marshals decided to measure 
Daly's drive to the foot. He hit it 329 yards and had to ease up on his 
second-shot wedge so it wouldn't fly the green. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly made the phrase grip and rip a part of the tour lexicon. In golf, and in 
life, he goes for it all. In a sport of singles hitters, he is Babe Ruth. If he 
played football, Al Davis would hire four Olympic sprinters and make him 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 When his round ended Thursday, and he emerged from the tiny tent where the 
players sign their scorecards, he was king of the tour again. Programs and 
visors and golf balls were thrust his way to sign. Security guards had to form 
a wedge as he walked and signed, occasionally stopping to accommodate an 
especially loud squeal from a 70ish female autograph seeker. It was hard to 
imagine a greater frenzy had the celebrity at hand been Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, who will turn 28 April 28, is trying hard to handle all this, while 
being a model citizen, too. His most recent suspension was not his first 
altercation with golf's powers-that-be. He hopes it was his last, just as he 
hopes that he has had his last taste of alcohol, his last domestic dispute and 
his last tantrum with his own furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to expect today," he said. "I didn't expect to play that 
well, to hit the ball that well . . . It was nice having that big crowd out 
there. That's a whole lot better than it was in 1991, before the PGA, when it 
was just me and my caddie and the scorekeeper, out there all alone." 
</P>
<P>
 He was quick to attribute at least part of the large gallery, highly unusual 
for a Thursday at any PGA event, to the presence of Faldo, considered by many 
the world's best golfer. Daly has also said a number of times, leading up to 
this comeback round, that he was grateful for the chance to get back this soon 
and that "I need the tour more than it needs me." 
</P>
<P>
 From the reaction of the crowd when his two-iron sailed 269 yards on No. 18, 
that might be debatable. 
</P>
<P>
 John Daly is back. And that's good for the PGA.

UCLA TURNS IT ON IN TIME FOR VICTORY; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: ZIDEK AND CHARLES 
O'BANNON EACH SCORE 18 POINTS, BUT BRUINS UNIMPRESSIVE IN DEFEATING LOWLY 
OREGON STATE, 78-67. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 UCLA slogged closer to the finish line Thursday night, pinning a 78-67 defeat 
on lowly Oregon State in a decidedly unimpressive performance that didn't 
exactly boost Ed O'Bannon's confidence level about the Bruins' chances in the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Knocking off No. 10 Louisville, then following it up by struggling against a 
Beaver team heading for its worst record in 92 years sort of does that to you. 
</P>
<P>
 Is UCLA simply turning it on and off, depending on the opposition? O'Bannon 
considered the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is we're going to have to turn it on and keep it on because if we 
play like this again, we'll be on an early flight home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, it seems pretty clear that nobody knows UCLA's flight pattern, 
and this is not exactly what you expect after 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Bruins, 21-5 and 13-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference, well, let's just 
say they've had much better games against much better teams than the Beavers 
(6-20).  
</P>
<P>
 This certainly has not been Oregon State's season. Not after seven consecutive 
defeats, a 2-15 conference record, its first 20-loss season and more than a few 
Beaverites calling for Coach Jim Anderson's bald head on a platter. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Brent Barry playing the best game of his career and the Bruins 
playing sort of half-interested, UCLA had to come from behind in the second 
half to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 It was still a four-point game, 67-63, when Shon Tarver scored after a rebound 
with 3:19 to play. Tyus Edney's short jumper from a left-side angle made the 
score 71-63 a minute later and UCLA closed it out with seven free throws the 
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA made it look difficult, although Barry had a hand in that. Rick Barry's 
son scored a career-high 31 points, including 20 in the first half when Jim 
Harrick tried defending him with Ed O'Bannon. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry had 10 points in the second half going against Tarver. 
</P>
<P>
 It took eight minutes for UCLA to fall behind by nine points in the first 
half, which ended with 11 UCLA turnovers and the Bruins trailing, 34-33. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, Harrick was wringing the life out of his rolled-up program and 
wondering where he was going to get some relief. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't come from his bench, which produced exactly two points in limited 
duty, that from Cameron Dollar in 23 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Zimmerman and Marquis Burns were the only other non-starters to get 
into the game and they were on the court for a total of nine minutes. Kevin 
Dempsey didn't budge. Harrick kept Dempsey on the bench for the first time in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins finally pulled themselves together and moved ahead to stay when 
Charles O'Bannon's jumper with 11:15 to go gave them a 54-52 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles finished with 18 points and a career-high four blocked shots. George 
Zidek matched O'Bannon's point total and put up his own career high with 14 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver struggled with only eight points and Ed O'Bannon made only four of 14 
shots, but Harrick said it is important to note the result on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, he said, the Bruins didn't lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played real good, we just played OK, not good enough to win a tournament 
game, but good enough to win tonight," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure we were ready mentally and emotionally to play, but we'll be 
ready next week, I'll tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Beavers were coming off a six-game losing streak in which they 
were outscored by an average of 25 points a game. So the pressure wasn't on 
them, Barry said, because the Beavers' destination was nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have anything to lose and that's something the big underdog always 
has," he said. "Those are the toughest games teams that are ranked have to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O'Bannon said it's way past time for UCLA to play games like the one 
that just ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it is," he said. "Maybe guys are saving it, putting it in 
second gear, cruising. We've got to stop it or we're going to get embarrassed 
before we get to the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 One more game remains for them to get it right. That would be Saturday 
afternoon in Eugene against Oregon. After that, it's tournament time. Early 
flights home beckon.

EVEN IN VICTORY, LAKERS ARE EMBARRASSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The amazing thing was that the Lakers could talk so clearly in their locker 
room late Thursday night. That would have seemed difficult to do after nearly 
choking so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 At least they salvaged a victory while losing face, blowing a 28-point lead in 
the first quarter to the NBA's worst team and falling behind in the third 
period before giving themselves the Heimlich to hold on and beat the Dallas 
Mavericks, 106-101, at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 11,149 often disbelieving, disgruntled fans, Vlade Divac got his second 
triple-double of the season with 22 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists, the 
latter tying a career high. The Mavericks almost got their biggest comeback 
victory ever, only to fall short. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone asked me the question if it would have been embarrassing if we had 
lost," James Worthy said. "It's still embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 Countered Coach Randy Pfund, when someone suggested he can't be too happy even 
with a victory: "I am 1,000% happy. In this league, you take a win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks arrived with the worst offense in the NBA and their leading 
scorer, Jamal Mashburn, home with a strained hip muscle. That left only one 
active player averaging in double figures, Jim Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened seemed inevitable. The Lakers needed six possessions to grab 
a 10-point lead, 12-2, then made that seem like a warm-up. The cushion grew to 
20 points at 32-12 less than 10 minutes into the game, then finally to 28, 
42-14, on Worthy's driving layup with 29 seconds left in the opening period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers shot 64% that first quarter, compared to 25% for the Mavericks, and 
got offensive contributions from all eight who played. The lead then remained 
at better than 20 points through the midpoint of the second quarter, and when 
Dallas began to whittle away, the intrusion seemed innocent enough. 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime, however, the Mavericks were within 66-55, even as the Lakers shot 
65.9%. A little more than two minutes into the third quarter, the deficit 
dropped to 68-60, then 72-70 before the teams traded baskets. Then it happened 
-- with 2:21 to go on Tim Legler's 16-footer -- a tie game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks -- the Mavericks without their best player -- had used a 64-36 
run to gain a 78-78 tie, so noted by the boos directed at the Lakers. It only 
got louder when Dallas temporarily took a one-point lead near the end of the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our legs started shaking, we were losing confidence and we couldn't make a 
basket," Divac said. "They got closer and closer, and it got worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing to live dangerously, the Lakers fell behind, 90-86, early in the 
fourth, before moving back ahead, 94-90, Worthy supplying a spark with a jumper 
and a feed to Divac for a layin. That held up for the win as the Mavericks got 
as close as two points and were down by three, 104-101, with 47 seconds left 
when forced to foul intentionally.

NBA ROUNDUP; HOUSTON'S DEFENSE STOPS SEATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The defense that kept the Houston Rockets atop the Midwest Division almost all 
season put them back in first place again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets held Seattle to 29 points in the second half, including four 
points in the final 6:27, Thursday night at Houston as they overcame an early 
14-point deficit to defeat the SuperSonics, 87-82. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave Houston a .002 percentage point lead over San Antonio in the 
Midwest Division. The loss for Seattle ended a six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Seattle went 5:11 without a basket and was whistled for a pair 
of illegal defense violations. Houston used a late 8-0 run to take the lead for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Sam Cassell put Houston ahead, 83-80, with two free throws with 26 
seconds to play, but Shawn Kemp's basket with 17 seconds remaining pulled the 
SuperSonics to within one. Cassell was fouled again and converted to give the 
Rockets a three-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 100, Portland 97 -- Latrell Sprewell scored 22 points at Oakland 
to help the Warriors avenge their worst loss of the season. The Warriors lost, 
137-108, at Portland on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat snapped Portland's four-game winning streak and was its second loss 
in the last 12 games.

MORNING BRIEFING: WORLD WAS A LOT NICER PLACE WHEN GRAHAM, BROWNS REIGNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Otto Graham, who knew something about winning when he quarterbacked the 
Cleveland Browns to seven championships in 10 years, is not happy with the 
current win-or-else philosophy of football. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then (1946-55), I don't think the fans or media were anywhere near as 
cruel as they are today," he told Mark Woods of Florida Today. "The picture has 
changed. Not just in sports, but all walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the stands -- and I'm talking about high-class people, doctors, 
lawyers -- they get up there and have a few drinks and turn into animals. I 
wish there was some way you could take all the fans into a locker room when 
their team has lost. Let them see those 300-pound guys with tears rolling down 
their cheeks and blood flowing from different wounds. They're human beings, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Graham: The 72-year-old Hall of Famer is not pleased with some of the 
players, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I see a player get in the end zone doing one of those crazy 
dances, my stomach hurts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What is Jack Nicklaus' playoff record in regular PGA Tour events? 
Faint praise: Peter May, the Boston Globe's pro basketball writer, apparently 
doesn't think much of the Lakers. In writing about the Celtics' Acie Earl, he 
noted that Earl played well against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In NBA terms, that is akin to saying your blind date had a good personality 
and didn't perspire too much," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty optimistic: If nothing else, the Mighty Ducks are optimistic in their 
first year. On March 4, they started printing playoff tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 No change: After Charles Barkley of the Phoenix Suns was ejected from a game 
against the New York Knicks, he took a shot at the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have been worried, but the Knicks can't score," he said. "I watched 
(the rest of) the game on TV. They couldn't score on TV, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Nicklaus has a 13-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Oscar De La Hoya, commenting on the fighting style of Jimmi 
Bredahl, whom De La Hoya defeated last Saturday: "He was holding me. I would 
hit him, hurt him, and (he would) just hold me. I believe he wanted to make me 
his girlfriend." SHAV GLICK

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: KMPC FIRINGS PROVE YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you work in sports-talk radio, it seems you can get away with just about 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Do something as tasteless as calling Nancy Kerrigan "Mr. Ed" and playing the 
theme song from the old television show about a talking horse, as KMPC's Joe 
McDonnell did last week, and at worst you'll be told to knock if off. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell a 16-year-old caller to stick a gun in his mouth and pull the trigger, as 
did XTRA's Lee Hamilton not long ago, and, wow, you'll be fined all of $250. 
</P>
<P>
 Go too far in your criticism of a team carried by your station -- a dastardly 
deed -- and you might get suspended for a couple of days, as McDonnell has 
been. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't ever, ever get a sponsor ticked off. That is a firing offense, as 
Brian Golden and Doug Krikorian, KMPC's midday co-hosts, found out. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden and Krikorian, along with morning host Charlie Tuna and a couple of 
disc jockeys from KMPC's sister station, K-LITE, were supposed to go to Willow 
Springs March 2 to test-drive a sponsor's cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Krikorian told program director Scott O'Neil he would be busy that day, 
working on a budding acting career. He had to attend a rehearsal for a bit part 
he has in a movie about Ty Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil told Krikorian OK, as long as Golden was there. But Golden, battling 
flu, decided to skip the test drive so he would be fit enough to do a four-hour 
boxing show the next day with Johnny Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't think the test drive was that important," Golden said. "I 
thought it was more important that I be ready to go on the air on Thursday. It 
was my indiscretion, my fault, that I didn't call. I didn't know who to call in 
Willow Springs, but I should have called the station." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he was still sick -- "It was easy to see he was very sick," Ortiz 
said -- Golden showed up to do a remote show from the Bonaventure Hotel, where 
a news conference was being held for the fight card marking the reopening of 
the Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, Golden got a call from O'Neil to report to the station for a 3 
p.m. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Oh no, I'm in trouble,' " Golden said. "But I never dreamed I 
would get fired." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden said the meeting with O'Neil and Bill Ward, the station's general 
manager, was amiable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no shouting or anything like that. We talked and then I was told to 
step out in the hall," he said. "Then I was called back in and told I was being 
terminated." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden, a sports columnist and reporter for the Antelope Valley Press, said 
KMPC knew he would be missing the next two weeks because he was going on 
assignment for his newspaper to baseball training camps in Arizona and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling seemed to be that since the station would probably be sold (to 
Capital Cities) by April 1, and that since I was going to miss 10 days anyway, 
that I might as well be terminated now." 
</P>
<P>
 But why Krikorian too? 
</P>
<P>
 Said O'Neil, who is fond of both: "What Brian did was definitely a fireable 
offense. I feel terrible about what happened, but by not showing up, and not 
calling, he blew a major account for us. Business is business. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for Doug, it's unfortunate. He and Brian had become closely identified 
with each other, and we just felt we needed to go in a different direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the mistake had already been made and the account lost, one wonders what 
was gained by the firings. There is speculation that KMPC sought to cut its 
payroll as the sale to Cap Cities nears. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the sale falls through, you never know, Golden and Krikorian might be 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were fired last June in a cost-cutting move, then brought back in October 
and paired up as a good-guy (Golden), bad-guy (Krikorian) tandem. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a good mix -- Golden's straightforward approach contrasting with 
Krikorian's acerbic comments -- and the ratings for the midday show almost 
tripled, going from a .3 share to a .8. 
</P>
<P>
 When on-air talent is fired despite increasing ratings -- for whatever reason 
-- you know strange things are going on. 
</P>
<P>
 That also was evident when Dodger reporter Larry Kahn and Angel reporter Jeff 
Biggs were recently told to return from spring training to work in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, it was another cost-cutting measure, even though the teams pick up 
most of the expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of all people, Golden figured to be the last guy to get fired. No one else 
works as hard, or is as popular, both inside the station and out, and no one 
seemed to have such a promising future. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were the program director at XTRA, I would have been on the phone to 
Brian the second I heard about what happened," O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden, besides doing the daily four-hour radio show, was still writing four 
columns a week for his newspaper, plus covering a sporting event most nights. 
He covered 129 Dodger and Angel home games last year, and he averages about 
20-25 stories and columns a week. 
</P>
<P>
 After covering a night game in Los Angeles, he sometimes would sleep at KMPC 
or stay in a motel, rather than drive back to his home in Lancaster. Wherever 
he stayed, he would be at work by 6 a.m. for a 10 a.m. show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured it took at least one hour of preparation for every hour I was on 
the air," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a business dominated by brash, self-absorbed, attention-seeking types, 
Golden was a breath of fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked in radio in Oklahoma after graduating from Penn State in 1980, but 
found he didn't like the business and opted for newspaper work. One thing that 
bothered him was that radio required him to draw too much attention to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more comfortable just being a conduit for information," he said. "That's 
all we should be." TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Lamb and Andre Aldridge are the new midday hosts at KMPC, but in the 
station's revolving door, it will be Paola Boivin with Aldridge next week, 
although every day but Wednesday and Thursday there is Angel baseball at noon. 
It will be Lamb and Larry Kahn in the afternoons, as Joe McDonnell takes more 
time off. . . . KMPC's popular boxing show, "Ringside With Johnny Ortiz," will 
continue on Fridays, usually 4-5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon got an impressive 7.1 TV rating. UCLA-Louisville 
basketball on Channel 7 later Sunday got only a 2.7. . . . Verne Lundquist has 
signed a new contract with CBS that will allow him to do NBA basketball for 
TNT, which also signed Hubie Brown to a new four-year deal. . . . ESPN has 
given Dick Vitale a contract through 2000. That should do something for 
Vitale's insecurity, featured in a recent Sports Illustrated story. . . . CBS' 
coverage of the NCAA tournament pairings will be carried live Sunday at 3:30 
p.m. . . . Among CBS commentators working the tournament will be former UCLA 
stars Larry Farmer and Ann Meyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on ESPN for cutting away from the GTE West senior golf playoff at Ojai 
last Sunday for "SportsCenter" and college basketball. . . . Shame on UCLA for 
not finding a television outlet for Thursday night's game against Oregon State. 
. . . Channel 7 is apparently so hard up for a sportscaster it took out an ad 
in the Hollywood Reporter this week. . . . NBC announced that Joe Gibbs will 
work in the "NFL Live" studio with Jim Lampley, Will McDonough, O.J. Simpson 
and Mike Ditka next fall. He will be given six weeks off to devote to his 
NASCAR racing team, but will still do features during that time. . . . Barry 
Bonds has a role in Wednesday's "Beverly Hills 90210" on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC no doubt is pleased that Tonya Harding will compete in the World 
Championships in Japan this month. The network will have three successive 
nights of prime-time coverage March 25-27. NBC this week added Robin Cousins, 
1980 Olympic gold-medal winner, to its broadcast team. . . . NBC also announced 
that Chris Evert will miss the Family Circle Cup, the French Open and Wimbledon 
because she is expecting her second child sometime between the French Open and 
Wimbledon. Tracy Austin will fill in for Evert. . . . On April 17, CBS will 
launch "Eye on Sports," an anthology show to be shown on 15 Sunday afternoons 
this spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first of four fights to be carried on ABC's "Wide World of Sports" this 
year, promising heavyweight Jeremy Williams of Long Beach takes on Larry Donald 
Saturday. Alex Wallau, although now a network vice president, will call the 
fight with Dan Dierdorf. Delayed coverage of the Florida Derby will also be on 
"Wide World." . . . ESPN's "Outside the Lines" series takes a look at sports 
gambling Monday at 5 p.m. . . . Magic Johnson's first "One-on-One" special on 
Fox will be televised Tuesday at 8 p.m. His guests are Tom and Roseanne Arnold, 
Garth Brooks and Shaquille O'Neal.

 Angel outfielder Bo Jackson, who says he's feeling the best he has all spring, 
celebrated his .400 batting average with a little extra-circular activity. He 
took his bow-and-arrow into the bleachers Thursday after everyone departed, 
shooting quite accurately at a target about 50 yards away . . . First baseman 
Eduardo Perez, who felt Giant outfielder Willie McGee's teeth sinking into his 
head in a collision at first base, shrugged off the pain and hit a three-run 
homer in the ninth inning."It was great because I got to hit it in front of my 
godfather (Orlando Cepeda)," Perez said. "He said, 'You hit that for me, 
right?' " . . . The Angels are expected to make their first wave of roster cuts 
today, but no veterans will be included, Rodgers said. They probably will send 
out: Pitchers Troy Percival, Ron Watson, Kyle Sebach, Bruce Egloff, Kyle 
Sebach, Bob Gamez and John Fritz; catchers Jose Monzon and Fausto Tejero; and 
outfielder Mark Sweeney. BOB NIGHTENGALE

FRENCH'S PASS DOESN'T FIND TARGET AND NEVADA TOPS FULLERTON, 68-64 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 James French made all the big plays down the stretch for Cal State Fullerton 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He just wishes he could have that last one back. 
</P>
<P>
 French scored seven points in the final 2:56, but turned the ball over with 
nine seconds to play as Nevada held on for a 68-64 victory in the first round 
of the Big West tournament at the Thomas & Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
 French's driving layup with 1:42 to play gave the Titans a 64-60 lead. But a 
three-point basket by Nevada's Jerry Hogan with 1:18 left and another by Shawn 
Pughsley with 24 seconds remaining put the Wolf Pack ahead, 66-64. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Fullerton timeout, French took the ball to the left of the key and 
tried to force a bounce pass to Chris St. Clair in the corner. Nevada's Marcus 
Iverson intercepted and fired a pass to Jimmy Moore, who laid it in for the 
clinching basket with six seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris was wide open for the three," French said. "I tried to fake Iverson up 
and bounce-pass it to him, but that was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth-seeded Nevada (11-16) advanced to today's quarterfinals against 
top-seeded New Mexico State. Fullerton, which had beaten Nevada twice in the 
regular season, ended the season at 8-19. MIKE REILLEY

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NATIONAL ROUNDUP; THIS TIME, MINUTEMEN GET IT DONE EARLY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Massachusetts didn't wait until the final seconds to beat Temple this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth-ranked Minutemen opened the Atlantic 10 Conference championship game 
at Amherst, Mass., with a 24-3 run and then held off a couple of second-half 
bursts by No. 12 Temple on the way to a 70-59 victory Thursday night and their 
third consecutive conference tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two times the teams met this season, Massachusetts (27-6) came away 
with one-point victories, both on baskets by Mike Williams. One was a 10-foot 
jump shot with three seconds left at Massachusetts. The other was a 25-foot 
banker with eight seconds to play at Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Williams got the Minutemen going with a three-point basket eight 
seconds into the game. The junior guard also had an answer when the Owls opened 
the second half with an 11-0 run to get to within three, making consecutive 
three-point shots to make it 41-32 with 15:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
 After Temple (22-7) closed to within 41-36, it was Williams' three-point play 
that capped a 5-0 run to make the score 46-36. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did what we had to do to win," Massachusetts Coach John Calipari said. 
"Champions step up in a game like this. This is what you live for." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Williams, who finished with 21 points: "Somebody had to step up. I was 
saying before the game I didn't want any last-second shots. I had enough of 
those." 
</P>
<P>
 The Minutemen earned the Atlantic 10's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament 
and are expected to be seeded second or third when the pairings are announced 
Sunday. Temple will receive an at-large bid and should be seeded fourth or 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to wait and see what happens in the games this weekend," Calipari 
said. "I don't know, though, how many teams are better than we were tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 21 St. Louis 80, Dayton 46 -- The Billikens ended Jim O'Brien's coaching 
career with one of his worst defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 In a first-round game in the Great Midwest Conference tournament at 
Cincinnati, St. Louis (23-4) led at halftime, 49-16. The Flyers had more 
turnovers (18) than points or shots attempted (17) at the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton fired O'Brien on March 2, but he stayed on for the rest of the season. 
The Flyers (6-21) lost their last three games, leaving O'Brien's record at 
61-87.  
</P>
<P>
 The 34-point loss was the Flyers' second-worst this season. They lost to 
Cincinnati by 39. 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis State 91, No. 22 Alabama Birmingham 86 -- The Tigers played perhaps 
their best game in their first losing season in 13 years as they upset the 
Blazers in the first round of the Great Midwest tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Five players scored in double figures for Memphis State (12-15). The Tigers 
outrebounded the Blazers, 39-29, and kept Alabama Birmingham (22-7) from 
getting into an offensive flow. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 25 Texas 96, Texas Christian 75 -- The Longhorns used their pressure 
defense to rout the Horned Frogs in the first round of the Southwest Conference 
tournament at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas (23-7), the regular-season conference champion, had 22 steals, including 
seven by Terrence Rencher. The quicker Longhorns, who also had a much deeper 
bench, forced the Horned Frogs (7-20) into numerous mistakes. OTHER GAMES Carl 
Ray Harris scored 29 points and made five of Fresno State's Western Athletic 
Conference tournament-record 13 three-point baskets as the Bulldogs eliminated 
Texas El Paso, 88-66, in the quarterfinals at Salt Lake City. Harris made five 
of seven three-point shots. In all, the Bulldogs (19-9) were 13 of 21. Fresno 
State bettered the record of 11 set by Wyoming in 1989 and matched by New 
Mexico last season. . . . Russell Larson scored 28 points and Randy Reid 26 as 
Brigham Young coasted to a 96-65 victory over Utah in another WAC tournament 
game. Larson made 12 of 14 shots as the third-seeded Cougars (20-8) eliminated 
Utah (14-14). Reid made seven of 10 shots. . . . San Diego State made only 16 
of 60 shots and lost to regular-season WAC champion New Mexico, 61-45. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John's (12-16) ended a six-game losing streak with an 80-72 victory over 
Pittsburgh at Madison Square Garden in the first round of the Big East 
tournament. The defeat was the ninth in a row for the Panthers, who finished 
the season 13-14 under Paul Evans. He was fired last week, but stayed on to 
finish the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley Person scored 28 points to help Auburn upset Vanderbilt, 81-56, in the 
first round of the Southeastern Conference tournament at Memphis. Auburn 
(11-16), seeded sixth in the SEC West, eliminated Vanderbilt (16-11), which was 
seeded third in the East. The Tigers outrebounded the Commodores, 41-30. . . . 
In another SEC game, Georgia (14-15) advanced to today's quarterfinals against 
top-ranked Arkansas by defeating Louisiana State, 83-70. The Tigers (11-16) had 
their first losing season in 17 years. LSU Coach Dale Brown was hit with two 
technical fouls in 14 seconds and was ejected with 7:29 to play in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati made it six in a row over DePaul by beating the Blue Demons, 95-86, 
in a first-round Great Midwest Conference tournament game. There were 64 fouls, 
including technicals on both coaches. Cincinnati (20-9) made 11 of its last 12 
free throws to clinch the victory. Invitation Only

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; USC POISED TO WIN TITLE AFTER VICTORY OVER OREGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The USC women's basketball team clinched at least a tie for the Pacific 10 
championship Thursday night with an 85-74 victory over Oregon and will try to 
win it outright Saturday against Oregon State at Lyon Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1,205 at the Sports Arena, USC won handily, running off to a 
second-half lead that reached 27 points with 4:35 to go. The Trojans, in 
raising their league-leading mark to 15-2 (22-3 overall), got a big night in 
the low post from Lisa Leslie and Tina Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 The duo teamed for 37 points and 18 rebounds, easily enough to withstand an 
eight-for-14 three-point shelling by Oregon's Jessica Schutt, who finished with 
34 points. Oregon fell to 18-8, 12-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans thus stayed a step ahead of Stanford, which defeated Washington 
State, 87-58. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Oregon State doesn't figure to go out quietly Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In USC's 63-56 victory Jan. 6 in Corvalis, Leslie and Oregon State's Kristina 
Lelas wound up in a confrontation which resulted in Lelas winding up on her 
back, minus one tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 After Thursday's game, Miller indicated her team guarded the wrong three-point 
shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Missy Crowshaw leads the Pac-10 in threes (46.2%), so she was the focus of 
our defense," Miller said. "So what happens? The other girl (Schutt) kills us." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie and Thompson steadily pushed the Trojans to a 38-29 halftime lead, 
leaping over Oregon's big front liners, Sara Wilson (6 foot 3) and Debbie 
Sporcich (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
 USC point guard Nicky McCrimmon, until she twisted a knee with 3:08 left, 
energized USC's transition game in the second half, boosting the Trojans to 
20-point leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon's last gasp seemed to come at the 10-minute mark, after Schutt and 
Sporcich had trimmed a 17-point Trojan lead to 13, 58-45.  
</P>
<P>
 But then Leslie scored twice underneath, Karleen Shields tipped in a Thompson 
miss and added two free throws for a 66-45 edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State 83, UCLA 62 -- Tanja Kostic scored 33 points and grabbed nine 
rebounds to lead the Beavers (17-9, 9-8) past the Bruins (15-11, 10-7) at 
Pauley Pavilion. Amy Jalewalia led UCLA with 14 points.

 Tony Harris scored 18 points to lead Washington State to a 77-71 victory over 
Stanford Thursday night at Pullman, Wash., and keep alive the Cougars' hopes 
for an NCAA tournament bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory puts Washington State, Stanford and Arizona State into a three-way 
tie for fourth place in the Pacific 10 Conference, each with a 9-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars (19-10 overall) and the Cardinal (16-10) traded leads most of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 16 California 62, Washington 56 -- Lamond Murray scored 20 of his 22 
points in the second half at Seattle to lead the Golden Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's performance came on a night when sophomore guard Jason Kidd 
struggled. Kidd finished with 12 points on two-for-12 shooting. Kidd made only 
one of seven three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal (22-6, 13-4) will wind up its regular season at Washington State on 
Saturday. Maurice Woods led Washington (5-21, 3-14) with 18 points.

ONE BAD PASS KNOCKS TITANS INTO EXIT LANE; BASKETBALL: FRENCH SCORES A BUNDLE 
LATE, BUT HIS TURNOVER WITH NINE SECONDS LEFT HELPS NEVADA WIN, 68-64. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's a moment Cal State Fullerton point guard James French will replay over 
and over in his mind the next few months -- a bad pass, a turnover and a memory 
he wishes he could erase. 
</P>
<P>
 French scored seven points in the final 2 minutes 56 seconds but turned over 
the ball with nine seconds left and ninth-seeded Nevada held on for a 68-64 
victory over the eighth-seeded Titans in a Big West tournament first-round game 
Thursday at the Thomas & Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada (11-16) advanced to today's quarterfinals against top-seeded New Mexico 
State by beating the Titans for the first time in three meetings this season. 
</P>
<P>
 And that left Greg Vernon, Fullerton's only senior, wondering if the Titans 
(8-19) had looked past Nevada, which they had defeated, 97-72, exactly one 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out thinking that because we had already beat Nevada twice in the 
regular season, it was going to be a cakewalk," said Vernon, who finished with 
13 points. "But it wasn't. This was a good learning experience for our guys 
coming back next year." 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly was a learning experience for French, a junior who made all the 
big plays down the stretch but just couldn't make the last one. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a running one-handed shot with 2:56 left and added a three-pointer 35 
seconds later. And his driving layup with 1:42 remaining pushed the Titans' 
lead to 64-60. 
</P>
<P>
 But a three-pointer by Nevada's Jerry Hogan with 1:18 left and another three 
by Shawn Pughsley with 24 seconds left put the Wolf Pack ahead, 66-64. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Fullerton timeout, French took the ball to the left of the key and 
tried to force a bounce pass to Chris St. Clair in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 It never got there. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada's Marcus Iverson stepped into the passing lane and grabbed the ball, 
then fired it to a Jimmy Moore, who laid it in for the clinching basket with 
six seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris was wide open for the three," French said. "I tried to fake Iverson up 
and bounce pass it to him, but that was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 One that left Fullerton Coach Brad Holland frustrated, but not pointing 
fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can make a mistake like that," Holland said. "He had made some big 
plays for us down the stretch. I felt very comfortable with the ball in his 
hands. I'll talk to him about it later. He's mentally tough. He'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans blew a 36-31 halftime lead by missing their first five shots. 
Nevada took control with a 14-2 run in the first 4:13. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a horrible way to start the second half," Holland said. "I thought 
that was a real key to the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Vernon brought the Titans back into it by scoring seven points in a 
13-1 run midway through the half. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mistakes in the final minutes cost the Titans a chance at their first 
Big West tournament victory since 1990 and ended a frustrating season in which 
they registered their worst record since going 4-23 under George McQuarn in 
1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go 8-19," Holland said, "you're falling short in some areas. But we 
were competitive this season, and our players could hold their heads up high 
when they come back next season." 
</P>
<P>
 For Vernon, a four-year letterman, the loss caps a frustrating season and 
college career. The Titans were winless in the tournament during his four years 
at Fullerton, and he played on only one winning team, last season's 15- 12 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really hate to see it end this way," he said.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; MONDESI A VIRTUAL LOCK TO BECOME RIGHT 
FIELDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can pencil in Raul Mondesi as the opening-day right fielder. It is 
virtually his job to lose and has little to do with the injuries that have 
beset Cory Snyder. Mondesi has been touted by Manager Tom Lasorda for the last 
two years and was the favorite coming into camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first seven exhibition games, Mondesi is batting .300 and has 
three stolen bases. He threw out two runners in a recent game and has made some 
key catches. Of the Dodgers' seven hits in an 8-0 loss to the Atlanta Braves on 
Thursday, Mondesi had two. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not too many players know I can throw, but maybe more know now," Mondesi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 feet 11, Mondesi weighs 215 pounds, an increase of 60 since he signed 
with the Dodgers in 1988. He is often kidded by his Dominican Republic 
teammates about how much he eats, but most of his weight gain is muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks like a big crab," said Miguel Batista, a friend who pitches for the 
Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser, who started against the Braves, threw mostly fastballs, giving 
up four runs and eight hits in four innings. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The legality of Chan Ho Park's hesitation pitch has become hotly debated among 
major league umpires, who may watch Park when he pitches Sunday to determine 
how they will deal with it.  
</P>
<P>
 Park has a series of unorthodox deliveries, but what had some New York Mets 
confused Monday was his hesitation shortly after the start of his windup, a 
pause so long that three times batters stepped out of the box.  
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda didn't think the umpire should allow time out after Park had begun his 
windup, hesitation or not. But National League umpire Bruce Froemming, who 
worked first base during that game, is not so sure. So he held a meeting 
Wednesday with Park, his interpreter Don Yi and Dodger pitching coach Ron 
Perranoski to discuss the topic. Ed Vargo, the league's director of umpires, 
may also attend Sunday's game to check out Park.  
</P>
<P>
 Rule 8.01a states that a pitcher must begin his windup while touching the 
pitching rubber with his pivot foot and the other foot free. "From this 
position any natural movement associated with his delivery of the ball to the 
batter commits him to the pitch without interruption or alteration." MARYANN 
HUDSON

IRVINE BREAKS BAD HABIT AT GOOD TIME; BASKETBALL: LEAD DWINDLES, BUT ANTEATERS 
HOLD ON FOR 53-48 VICTORY OVER SANTA BARBARA AT BIG WEST TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Senior point guard Lloyd Mumford said he never once thought, "Here we go 
again," but you can bet it was on the mind of every UC Irvine fan in the Thomas 
& Mack Center Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Santa Barbara did its best to hand the Anteaters a run-away victory in the 
opening game of the Big West Tournament, but -- staying true to their 
season-long form of flailing in the face of prosperity -- Mumford and Co. 
refused to take the gift graciously. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as winning ugly goes, this one turned out to be a fright mask. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara missed 20 of its first 22 shots and made only five of 34 in the 
first half, but the Gauchos forced the Anteaters to make some clutch plays and 
free throws down the stretch before finally succumbing, 53-48. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine led by 14 early in the second half, but the Gauchos scratched their way 
back to within 49-48 with 19 seconds left when Clayton Madden made one of two 
free throws. Anteater guard Chris Brown was fouled on the ensuing inbounds play 
and made both free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Santa Barbara guard Phillip Turner drove the length of the floor and 
fired a bounce pass past Kyle Milling and out of bounds and Brown scored a 
layup on a long inbounds pass with four seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Only then was Mumford assured of having at least one more game in his college 
career. The Anteaters (8-19) play Utah State at 1 p.m. today in the 
quarterfinals. They split the season series with the Aggies, handing Utah State 
one of its two conference losses at home and losing in Irvine in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were able to maintain the intensity that we usually just show flashes of," 
Mumford said. "I guess it was the atmosphere and the situation here. We're not 
a last-place team and we wanted to show it. And that positivity spread among 
our team." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the inability to make the ball go through the ring was spreading 
negativity throughout the Gaucho ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confidence is a very fleeting thing," Santa Barbara Coach Jerry Pimm said, 
"and we obviously had some anxiety creeping in. It was a nightmare. It's not 
easy to sit there and watch a team that was shooting 48% in conference go 
through that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it doesn't do any good for me to butt heads with a player. My approach is 
to remain calm and patient. It's been Irvine's pattern to have some dry spells 
and we were counting on it in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters, who held a nine-point lead over the Gauchos at halftime March 3 
but 15 minutes later trailed by 20 points, obliged again. Santa Barbara 
outscored Irvine, 13-2, in a five-minute stretch midway through the second half 
and appeared poised to beat the Anteaters despite woeful shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a typical win for us," Irvine Coach Rod Baker said, unable to keep 
from smiling. "Of course we haven't had many wins, but this was typical. We 
played pretty well, then relaxed to make it more competitive and then made some 
plays down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 The Not-So-Fabulous Baker Boys should have led by at least 30 at the 
intermission, but they only shot 39% and had 12 turnovers in the first half to 
manage a 26-14 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Baker discouraged his team had failed to take advantage of Santa Barbara's 
inept shooting? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had seen us play this year, you would know I'm never unhappy when 
we're up," he said. "The thing is we played at the level (of intensity) that 
we're supposed to play at. I beat these guys all week in practice and I think 
they're excited about this tournament. We want to stay here all weekend and we 
want to be on the floor, not watching." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the Gauchos, who ended the season with a 13-17 record, Pimm's worst 
in 13 seasons at the school, harbored the same lofty goal. But it was bound to 
end on a day when their top three scorers in Big West play -- Doug Muse, Turner 
and Mark Flick -- were a combined eight of 37 from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine had only one player in double figures. Brown, who made three of eight 
three pointers, finished with a game-high 16 points.

LYNWOOD GIRLS OVERWHELM BUENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynwood High players and coaches said they knew it was only a matter of time 
before their pressure defense wore down Ventura Buena.  
</P>
<P>
 They were correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the third quarter of Thursday night's Southern Regional 
Division I girls' basketball semifinal at Lynwood, Buena led by one point. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lynwood outscored the Bulldogs by 22 points the rest of the way to win, 
59-38, and advance to the regional final on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew Buena was going to come out and play us tough for a couple of 
quarters," said Timicha Kirby, who led Lynwood with 25 points. "But we knew our 
defense would pull us through." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive year that the Knights (31-1) defeated the 
Bulldogs (25-3) in the state tournament. Last season, Lynwood beat Buena in the 
regional final by 11 points and went on to win the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of natural athletic ability, they have much more than us," Buena 
Coach Joe Vaughan said. "They should be good." KENNEDY COSGROVE

INGLEWOOD DEFEATS DOMINGUEZ; DIVISION II: SENTINELS HOLD OFF DONS, 60-56, AFTER 
PIERCE FOULS OUT.

 When Compton Dominguez High forward Jaimie Gillin stepped to the foul line 
needing two free throws to tie the score with five seconds to play, Inglewood 
Coach Patrick Roy knew the shots would mean more than a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way we could beat them in overtime without Paul Pierce," Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roy didn't have to worry about an extra session without his star, because 
Gillin missed the front end of a one-and-one and the top-seeded Sentinels went 
on to defeat the Dons, 60-56, in the Southern Regional Division II semifinals 
Thursday night before 2,100 at Inglewood High. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Pierce's fifth foul that sent Gillin to the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood forward Abdul Benjamin went to the foul line for a one-and-one with 
four seconds to play. He missed his first attempt, but Dominguez guard Thomas 
Prince stepped into the lane too early, giving Benjamin another chance. He took 
advantage, making both shots to close the door on fourth-seeded Dominguez 
(30-3). 
</P>
<P>
 "He bailed me out," Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels (30-3) will play East Bakersfield (27-4) the final Saturday at 
Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But their season was on the verge of ending when Dominguez took a 50-45 lead 
with 5:12 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Pierce, who had 16 points and 11 rebounds, the Sentinels went on a 10-0 
run to lead, 55-50, with 3:08 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was concerned for a minute," Pierce said. "I felt I wasn't playing well, I 
was letting them down. They needed me down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez was led by Prince and Gillin, who each scored 14 points.

SANTA CLARA PRESSED INTO LOSS; DIVISION IV BOYS: SAN DIEGO LINCOLN FORCES 24 
TURNOVERS AND PREVAILS, 83-52. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS ELLO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the Santa Clara High boys' basketball team, a surprisingly good season 
ended on a dismal note Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to handle the defensive pressure applied by San Diego Lincoln, the 
Saints rarely got the ball to their best player, Damian Cantrell, committed 24 
turnovers, and fell apart in the second half of an 83-52 loss in the semifinals 
of the Southern Regional Division IV State playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good season overall because nobody expected us to get this far," 
said Santa Clara Coach Lou Cvijanovich, whose team finished 20-9. "But, 
obviously, it wasn't a very good ending." 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln (23-7) had a lot to do with that. The Hornets, aptly named because 
they really did swarm on defense, took Santa Clara out of its patient offensive 
sets, forced an up-tempo style, and then blew the game open with a 26-4 run to 
start the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets played so well they even surprised themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought for sure it was going to be a slowdown type of game," said 
Lincoln's 6-foot-8 center Mark Sanford, who scored 24 points. "But the way we 
were able to press them and get into our running game turned it into a 
fast-paced style." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints actually started well with Cantrell hitting a three-point basket 
and a layup to help build a 7-0 lead. But by the end of the first quarter, 
Lincoln had forced eight turnovers and pulled ahead, 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
 By that point, Cantrell probably felt like a star wide receiver whose 
quarterback keeps getting sacked. After he scored 37 points in each of the past 
two games, Cantrell hardly figured in the offense Thursday because his 
teammates couldn't control the ball long enough to get it to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell finished with 16 points before fouling out in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guards simply did not do their job," Cvijanovich said. "We were trying to 
get into what we do best, but we couldn't do it. Lincoln has a lot of 
tremendous athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, because it battled the taller Hornets to a standstill on the 
boards, Santa Clara trailed by only seven, 34-27, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln, with its pressure, turned the third quarter into a track meet, racing 
from end to end for layups while the Saints gasped for air. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Louis Johnson scored breakaway layups on three consecutive 
possessions, and Sanford ended the spurt with two consecutive uncontested 
dunks. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two minutes remained in the third quarter, and Lincoln's lead had 
grown to 60-31. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted the blowout," Sanford said. "We want the teams we're going to be 
playing later to be taking note that we're a team to be reckoned with." 
</P>
<P>
 Next up for Lincoln, in the Southern Region Division IV finals, is top-seeded 
Verbum Dei, which beat Santa Clara by only six last weekend in the Southern 
Section 4-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lincoln's awfully good," Cvijanovich said. "They've always had a lot of good 
athletes, but now they have size and poise as well. We simply couldn't handle 
them."

ALEMANY ACCELERATES PAST MISSION BAY; DIVISION II GIRLS: UNBEATEN INDIANS WIN, 
68-51, BEHIND FUNICELLO'S 30 POINTS. 
</P>

<P>
 They had to abandon their school after the Jan. 17 earthquake, and have been 
road warriors since. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't mattered. The Alemany High girls' basketball team has played with 
abandon, beating every opponent. That didn't change Thursday night as the 
Indians routed Mission Bay, 68-51, at St. Francis High in the Southern Regional 
Division II semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But it almost did. The Buccaneers nearly beat Alemany (30-0) at its own game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers (28-3) brought their fans, who filled half the gym. They 
brought their pep squad and littered the place with posters. They nearly turned 
this into a home game about 140 miles away from their San Diego campus. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alemany is used to foreign surroundings. The Indians simply raid gyms, 
quiet hostile crowds and beat all opponents. These nomads are practically 
knocking on the door of Oakland Coliseum Arena, site of the state final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we're going to play well Saturday (in the regional final), because 
now they're getting a taste of what it's all about," said Alemany Coach Melissa 
Hearlihy, who celebrated her 200th victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Bay tried to stop her at 199 with a scratching, hustling, 
defensive-minded effort. Alemany jumped to a 20-10 lead after one quarter, 
thanks to seven Buccaneer turnovers. But Mission Bay forced 10 turnovers in the 
second quarter, went on a 10-0 run and closed the gap to 29-26 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Buccaneers didn't have anybody taller than six feet, and 6-foot-3 
Alemany sophomore Carly Funicello scored a career-high 30 points, 18 in the 
second half. She also had 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on fire," Funicello said. "I was having the time of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany had more turnovers (10) than shots (six) in the second quarter. And 
with 2 minutes 39 seconds to play in the third, Mission Bay took a 35-34 lead 
on Brea Lowary's three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played strong defense," Funicello said. "They got into our passing 
lanes. They were a tough team." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly McKay (12 points, seven assists) hit a jump shot and drove for a layup 
to help restore order for Alemany, giving the Indians a 40-35 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Funicello helped complete Alemany's startling 24-2 run, scoring 13 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Samantha Rigley (12 points) hit a three-pointer with 2:57 that ended the run 
and put the game out of reach, 56-37. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians shot 50% from the field while holding Mission Bay to 28%. Alemany 
will face Woodbridge, an 84-63 winner over San Bernardino, in Saturday's 
regional final in Anaheim. STATE SCOREBOARD

CAL LUTHERAN PLAYS TO REACH ROUND OF EIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal Lutheran men's basketball team will attempt to take a step into 
uncharted territory at 3:30 p.m. PST today when the Kingsmen play Greensboro 
(N.C.) in a semifinal of the NCAA Division III South-West sectional at the 
University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (25-2) defeated UC San Diego, 95-81, Saturday to advance to the 
third round of the Division III playoffs for the second time in the past three 
seasons, but a victory over Dixie Conference champion Greensboro (25-3) would 
propel the Kingsmen into the round of eight for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look at (Greensboro), it's like looking in the mirror," Coach Mike 
Dunlap said. "They're a lot like us. They like to run and they play man-to-man 
defense. If we have an advantage, it might be inside. We seem to be a little 
bit bulkier than they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Forwards Brad Apple (16.5 points a game) and Cory White (15.8) and guard Kevin 
Beard (15.8) are the leading scorers for the Pride, which averages 95.7 points. 
Cal Lutheran averages 94.2. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Damon Ridley (20.2) and forwards Derrick Clark (15.9) and Rupert Sapwell 
(12.5) will lead the Kingsmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal Lutheran-Greensboro winner will play the St. Thomas-Hampden-Sydney 
(Va.) winner for the sectional championship Saturday with the winner advancing 
to the final four at Buffalo (N.Y.) State College on March 18-19. JOHN ORTEGA

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD; DREAM PROPELS PEPPERDINE'S JONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As his splendid college basketball career is about to conclude with a third 
trip to the NCAA tournament, Pepperdine forward Dana Jones was asked to divulge 
his secret. 
</P>
<P>
 What was the driving force throughout a career in which the former North 
Hollywood High player was named first-team All-West Coast Conference three 
times and made the WCC all-tournament team four times? 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is my dream to play at the next level is what keeps me 
going," said Jones, a 6-foot-6 senior forward who is averaging a team-high 18.5 
points and 9.9 rebounds and was most valuable player of the WCC tournament 
after the Waves defeated San Diego, 56-53, in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of telling myself this is what I want to do," he said. "It's in 
the back of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 While pursuing his dream to play professionally for the past four seasons, 
Jones has become the leading rebounder (1,028) in Pepperdine's 56-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 He also leads in steals with 206, is the Waves' third-highest scorer (1,662 
points) and needs 13 to pass Eric White at No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no small feat that Jones will graduate in April with a degree in 
sociology; in his four years, he attended the summer session three times to 
complete his course work. 
</P>
<P>
 He might not think about it much, but when Jones reflects on his Pepperdine 
experience, his thoughts center on Coach Tom Asbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was one of the first key recruits Asbury landed after he replaced Jim 
Harrick. Together, Jones and Asbury have led Pepperdine to at least a share of 
the WCC title the past four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'll miss him, because I'll always come around," Jones said of 
Asbury. "But as far as playing for him, yeah. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a very good relationship. We've grown together. He's been a great 
help in my success here." 
</P>
<P>
 Tragedy hit the Asbury family before the 1993-94 season when the coach's 
oldest daughter, Stacey, who had battled anorexia nervosa for nearly six years, 
died of heart failure in September. She was 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury considered taking an extended leave of absence. Instead, Asbury, Jones 
and the Waves stayed together and struggled to a 12-10 start before winning 
their last seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a matter of everybody wanting to play every night, everybody 
knowing their role and everybody playing consistently at the same time," Jones 
said. "The past couple of weeks we've done that. The result is we've won 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 In the WCC tournament final, Pepperdine trailed most of the game until Jones, 
who had a game-high 17 points, hit a layup with 1 minute 42 seconds left to put 
the Waves ahead for good. A national television camera caught Jones and Asbury 
embracing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just looking at him, I could see happiness on his face," Jones said of 
Asbury. "We've been through a lot this year. To have this happen to us . . . 
it's appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine has an NCAA tournament record of 4-11. The Waves' past two trips 
resulted in early exits: a 71-51 loss to Seton Hall in 1991 and an 80-70 defeat 
by Memphis State in 1992. Jones played in both games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first two years it was fun and everything," Jones said. "The atmosphere 
was great. But now I just want to go and play hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have just as good a chance as anybody. We want to play hard and with 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 An upset by 1993 WCC tournament champion Santa Clara over highly touted 
Arizona in the first round last season could provide inspiration for 
Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't take that as a shock, though," Jones said. "Why couldn't they beat 
Arizona? It's a tournament. I think that's why they call it March Madness." 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: Mike Spears (Hueneme) had 24 points, six rebounds and three 
blocked shots as Westmont upset No. 5 Azusa Pacific, 83-79, for the Golden 
State Athletic Conference tournament championship. Spears, a 6-6 senior forward 
who is averaging 15.5 points and 5.2 rebounds, made 10 of 17 shots from the 
field to help the Warriors gain an automatic berth in next week's NAIA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Hill (Cleveland), despite his 12.8 scoring average and 40.2% accuracy 
from three-point range, has been removed from Washington State's starting 
lineup. The Cougars (18-10) entered this week's Pacific 10 Conference series 
with Stanford and California needing two victories for a chance at an NCAA 
tournament berth. Hill scored a team-high 18 points the last time Washington 
State played Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 D.J. Jackson's scoring average has dipped to 10.3 points for top-seeded New 
Mexico State, which will play either Cal State Fullerton or Nevada in today's 
second round of the Big West tournament. Jackson, from Antelope Valley College, 
has made 50 three-point shots but has scored only nine points in the past three 
contests.

SANTA ANITA; SKYLAUNCH RALLIES IN STRETCH TO BEAT NANCYS FRENCH FRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Skylaunch, ridden by Gary Stevens, lagged back until the stretch to win the 
$40,000 feature by 1 1/4 lengths Thursday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancys French Fry, the favorite under Fernando Valenzuela, finished second, 2 
1/4 lengths in front of Private Premier in a field of seven in the allowance 
race for 4-year-olds and up, all carrying 118 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Skylaunch, a 6-year-old Kentucky-bred gelding, covered a mile over a fast 
track in 1:35 4-5 and paid $5.60, $2.80 and $2.40 as the second choice. He 
earned $22,000 for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancys French Fry returned $2.80 and $2.20 and Private Premier, with Eddie 
Delahoussaye aboard, showed at $2.60. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancys French Fry made her move on the final turn and had the advantage at the 
furlong marker but could not maintain the pace. Private Premier had the lead by 
a head at the three-quarter mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens won his third race in the ninth aboard longshot Wild Lightning, paying 
$39.20 for the win. He won the third race aboard Gavel Gate.

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; TRAINER OF GO FOR GIN WOULD RATHER GO FOR 
THE ROSES AGAIN 
</P>

<P>
 Trainer Nick Zito likes to give tours of his 1994 enclosed pickup truck, 
parked not far from his barn at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Want a picture of Strike The Gold?" Zito says. 
</P>
<P>
 He reaches into the back of the truck, for a package of about 100 winner's 
circle pictures from the 1991 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Want me to sign one for you?" Zito says. 
</P>
<P>
 Zito autographs the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't even tell I trained the horse," Zito says. "You got to look close to 
see my hand on the far left-hand side. That's my nose, too." 
</P>
<P>
 On one knee in front of Zito, in full view, is a smartly attired man in a 
straw hat. He has one pair of binoculars hanging from his neck, and is looking 
out through another set, effectively blocking his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can ask everybody else in that picture, and not one of them knows who 
that guy is," Zito says. "What would a guy be doing while they're taking a 
winner's-circle picture, looking out through a pair of binoculars?" 
</P>
<P>
 Zito goes to the front of the truck, opens the door and pops a cassette into 
the tape player. It's a tape by John Asher, the award-winning Louisville 
broadcaster, of interviews before and after Strike The Gold had won the Derby, 
with a call of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play it every once in a while," Zito says. "When I'm down, this tape picks 
me back up." 
</P>
<P>
 Zito reaches into the glove compartment and produces a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's from a guy in Louisville I know," he says. "A very important guy there." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter says something about The Man Upstairs asking Zito to have a seat in 
His living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows?" Zito says. "Could be an omen." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Philip Zito, 46, is in need of a Kentucky Derby fix. His first Derby 
starter, Thirty Six Red, ran ninth in 1990, and then came Strike The Gold the 
next year, thundering down the stretch to beat Best Pal by 1 3/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks before the Kentucky Derby, Strike The Gold finished second behind 
Fly So Free in the Florida Derby, and Zito will run a two-horse entry Saturday 
in the $500,000, 1 1/8-mile race. The big horse in the barn is Go For Gin, who 
has won three stakes, and he will be coupled with Crary, winless in three 
starts this year. They are the mild 3-1 morning-line favorites in what will be 
a capacity field of 14 3-year-olds. Actually, 15 horses were entered Thursday, 
but the rules restrict the field to 14, based on purses earned in graded 
stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Paulson bred and owns 50% of Crary, in partnership with Joe Cornacchio 
and Bill Condren, who bought Go For Gin as a yearling for $150,000. Cornacchio 
and Condren also raced Strike The Gold with B. Giles Brophy, a partnership that 
unraveled after the Derby. Because of a disagreement about the management of 
the horse, there were lawsuits and finally the colt was sold at auction, with 
Cornacchio and Condren out-bidding Brophy by paying $2.9 million. Strike The 
Gold won only five races, but he was a big-stakes horse and was retired to stud 
last year after piling up purses of $3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Zito, caught in the middle as the owners squabbled, long ago wearied of 
talking about their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sale of the horse was a stupid charade," he said this week, happy to 
relay the news that P.G. Johnson, his training replacement when Brophy traveled 
on, had in effect fired the owner this week, citing "major philosophical 
differences." 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin is a son of Cormorant and Never Knock, which makes him a half 
brother of Pleasant Tap in a family that includes Pleasant Colony, winner of 
the 1981 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very consistent horse," said Jerry Bailey, who has ridden Go For 
Gin in all but one of his seven races. "He finished second last time, even 
though he wasn't at his best that day." 
</P>
<P>
 In his last race, the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream on Feb. 19, Go For Gin 
came from slightly off the pace on a wet track and missed catching Dehere by 
three-quarters of a length. Dehere, who would have been favored in the Florida 
Derby, underwent surgery this week for a lower-leg fracture that will sideline 
him for about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin had won four consecutive races, all by comfortable margins, before 
the Fountain of Youth. His overall record is four victories and two seconds in 
seven tries. Bailey knew about the colt's potential before he ran his first 
race. Last August, on the morning of the Travers at Saratoga, Bailey made a 
special trip to the track to ride Go For Gin in a workout. In the afternoon, 
Bailey won the $1-million Travers with Sea Hero, his Kentucky Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry wouldn't have come out that day to work just any horse," Zito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zito's other horse, Crary, was not a priority for Craig Perret, who has opted 
to take Ride The Rails, the third-place finisher in the Fountain of Youth, in 
the Florida Derby. Zito has hired Joe Bravo to ride Crary, who had been ridden 
by Perret in his first six starts, including a second on Feb. 20 behind Patton, 
one of the fastest horses in Florida before he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Zito will split the horses after the Florida Derby, sending Crary to Keeneland 
for the Blue Grass Stakes on April 16 and running Go For Gin in the Wood 
Memorial the same day. Go For Gin might be the most important horse in the barn 
right now, but Sara Zito, the trainer's 9-year-old daughter, prefers Crary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call him Junior," she said. "He looks like Strike The Gold. Only he doesn't 
bite as much." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a lot of buzz at Gulfstream about Canaveral, unbeaten in two 
starts, but he probably won't be able to run in the Florida Derby. With 15 
horses entered, Canaveral wound up on the also-eligible list and needs a 
scratch to get in. "I'm a bit discouraged about this," trainer Frank Brothers 
said. "The horse has been training very well and we were set on running. Maybe 
it'll be a blessing in disguise. We'll just have to regroup and figure another 
path (to the Kentucky Derby). There's an allowance race here the last day of 
the meet (next Wednesday), and another possibility is the Louisiana Derby 
(March 19)." Canaveral probably won't run even if another horse scratches. 
"That 14 hole would be a tough spot for an inexperienced horse," Brothers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the field, in post-position order: Line Dance, Fabulous Frolic, Crary, 
Ride The Rails, Amathos, Holy Bull, Halo's Image, Dramatic Gold, Lahint, 
Rocky's Halo, Mr. Angel, Lynn's Notebook, Go For Gin and Robannier. . . . Chris 
McCarron, who would have ridden Dehere if he were running Saturday, has taken 
the mount on Lahint. . . . Trainer Mel Stute and jockey Alex Solis, who came 
from California to win the 1986 Florida Derby with Snow Chief, are back with 
Robannier. . . . Dramatic Gold, winner of the Bradbury at Santa Anita, will be 
ridden by Corey Black. . . . Behind the Nick Zito entry on the morning line is 
Holy Bull at 4-1. . . . All of the horses will carry 122 pounds.

ALL SIGNS PROVE BAD FOR VILLAGE CHRISTIAN; DIVISION IV GIRLS: ST. BERNARD ENDS 
CRUSADERS' SEASON WITH 83-56 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A large banner draped in the St. Bernard High gym accurately forecast Thursday 
night's semifinal of the Southern Regional Division IV State girls' playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stomp On The Village People," the sign read, and the defending state champion 
Vikings obliged, polishing off Village Christian, 83-56. 
</P>
<P>
 With a front line that includes 6-foot-4 forward Marte Alexander and 6-2 
forward Olympia Scott, St. Bernard (27-5) towered over the Crusaders (26-3), 
whose tallest player is 5-11 senior center Christy Ludwig. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who will play at Stanford next season, had 26 points, 19 rebounds and 
five blocks. Alexander, who signed with Arizona, had 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we did a good job considering the size disadvantage," Village 
Christian Coach John Domke said. "They just have a great team." 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian kept the score close and trailed by only eight with 2 
minutes, 43 seconds remaining in the third quarter, but St. Bernard pulled away 
to a 58-41 lead heading into the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely four minutes later, the Crusaders trailed by 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best team we've played so far as far as aggressiveness and 
defending the post," St. Bernard Coach Lori Pawinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior guard Trisha Palmquist led the Crusaders with 18 points and Lindy James 
had 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just too good," Palmquist said. "There was really nothing we could 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to stop St. Bernard's powerful front line, the Crusaders tried 
driving the lane to draw fouls. The tactic proved ineffective, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it worked real well in the first half," Domke said. "But we just 
couldn't capitalize in the end."

EXPLOSIVE LYNWOOD WEARS DOWN BUENA; DIVISION I GIRLS: KNIGHTS RALLY IN SECOND 
HALF WITH PRESSURE DEFENSE TO WIN GOING AWAY, 59-38. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Lynwood High players and coaches said they knew it was only a matter of time 
before their pressure defense wore down the Buena girls' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 They were correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the third quarter of Thursday's State Southern Regional 
semifinal, Buena led by a point. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lynwood outscored the Bulldogs by 22 the rest of the way to win, 59-38, 
and advance to the regional final on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew Buena was going to come out and play us tough for a couple of 
quarters," said Knight forward Timicha Kirby, who scored a game-high 25 points. 
"But we knew our defense would pull us through." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Buena Coach Joe Vaughan: "In terms of natural athletic ability, they have 
much more than us." 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the second consecutive year that the Knights (31-1) defeated the 
Bulldogs (25-3) in the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Lynwood beat them in the regional final by 11 points and went on 
to win the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right at the end of the third quarter was a turning point," Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I thought we got a little careless with the ball. You have to keep them 
in a half-court game." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, that's exactly what Buena did. The Bulldogs' zone defense 
and inside strength caused problems for Lynwood, as Buena center Michelle 
Giordano drew foul after foul near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano, a 6-0 senior who has enjoyed a brilliant career at Buena and has 
signed with Arizona, scored 10 first-half points, all on free throws. But she 
scored only five in the second half before fouling out. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a great game, and I wish her all the best at Arizona," Kirby said of 
Giordano. "But it's team defense that wins championships and that's what we 
thrive on here at Lynwood."

CAMPBELL HALL FALLS AS BUZZER-BEATING BANK SHOT IS ON MONEY; DIVISION V BOYS: 
PACIFIC HILLS OVERCOMES NINE-POINT DEFICIT IN FOURTH QUARTER TO ELIMINATE 
VIKINGS, 44-42. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 At various times Thursday night, Campbell Hall High played at its peak and at 
its worst in a Southern Regional Division V semifinal against Pacific Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the Vikings, the worst came in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Danny Brummel hit a 10-foot bank shot as the buzzer sounded to 
give Pacific Hills a 44-42 victory at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall, the Southern Section Division V-AA champion, did not score in 
the final 4:33, blowing a nine-point lead. The Vikings also turned the ball 
over four times in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The final turnover occurred when point guard Damon Glymph was called for 
traveling in the backcourt with four seconds to play while being closely 
guarded by two defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Hills Coach John Bobich called for a lob play from Bryan Sterling 
underneath the basket to Brummel. Sterling (15 points) had tied the score 
seconds earlier on a fadeaway jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall countered by having 6-foot-10 center Alex Lopez (18 points) 
guard the throw-in, but Sterling lobbed the ball perfectly to Brummel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if we stayed within striking distance we would have a chance," Brummel 
said. "When I let it go the angle looked good to bank in," 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall played a superb first half, taking a 29-18 lead. And Pacific 
Hills still trailed, 42-33, with 4:33 to play after Campbell Hall's Simeon 
Woodall (11 points) hit one of two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings attempted only three shots the rest of the game, partly because of 
the turnovers and partly in a conscious effort to slow the tempo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't match their effort or level of concentration over the last few 
minutes," Campbell Hall Coach Jon Palarz said. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling behind, 6-0, in the opening minute, the Vikings outscored 
Pacific Hills, 29-12, the rest of the first half. The Vikings used a trap 
defense to force six turnovers over a four-minute span late in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Glymph was the catalyst for the defensive effort. He came off the bench and 
had three steals, all of which led to baskets or opportunities at the foul 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The run ended at the half, when little-used sophomore Justin Wallace hit an 
18-footer as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall was not called for a personal foul until late in the third 
quarter. Meanwhile, Brummel picked up his third foul in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Hills (23-9) rebounded behind Brummel and Sterling to pull within 
35-33 early in the fourth quarter before Lopez scored six straight points, 
setting the stage for the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (24-9) had trouble taking care of the ball in the second half, 
committing 11 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a jump on them at halftime," Wallace said. "It's just a shame we had 
to play our best quarter and our worst quarter in the same game."

DIGEST: TWO CITY HIGH SCHOOLS DROP BOYS' VOLLEYBALL

 Cleveland and El Camino Real highs will not field boys' volleyball teams this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Because El Camino Real already had filled the maximum number of paid coaching 
positions -- 23 -- allowed by City Section guidelines, the school was forced to 
drop a sport when it added boys' soccer earlier this season.The school chose to 
drop boys' volleyball in part because Coach John Theisen left the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The City instituted the limit on coaching positions in 1991 as a 
cost-containment measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most schools were not up to their maximum (then)," City Commissioner Barbara 
Fiege said. "Now, because we're making a push to add as many sports as we can, 
and there seems to be more students than ever before who want to participate, 
(the limit) is starting to become a difficulty." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland dropped boys' volleyball because it could not find a replacement for 
last year's coach, Tim Gaines, a walk-on who also coached the girls' team. 
Gaines resigned after the fall season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland officials said they hope to field a girls' team in the fall and a 
boys' team next spring. KENNEDY COSGROVE

SANTA MARGARITA SCORELESS IN FINAL 3:20 OF ITS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though Santa Margarita led much of the way and had a four-point lead late 
in the game, the Eagles looked as if they were there for the taking. 
</P>
<P>
 University of San Diego High School obliged and took Santa Margarita out of 
the Division III Southern California Regional tournament with a 41-39 victory 
in front of a standing-room-only crowd of 3,000 at University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-seeded Dons will play top-seeded Pacifica at 11:30 a.m. Saturday at 
the Anaheim Arena for the regional title. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita (25-7) had plenty of chances to be in Saturday's game, but 
missed free throws and turnovers were the Eagles' downfall. They missed nine of 
16 free throws and made two key turnovers in the last two minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles scored four consecutive points on baskets by Brendan Mulligan and 
Brian Finneran to take a 39-35 lead with three minutes, 20 seconds left. But 
they never scored again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the tide was turning a little," Santa Margarita Coach Jerry DeBusk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it turned toward USDHS and it never turned back. Josh Merrill hit one 
of two free throws to make it 39-36 with 2:50 left and Scott Pharis converted a 
Mulligan turnover into a layup that made it 39-38 with 2:16 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita held the ball until Brad Finneran threw a lazy half-court pass 
that Merrill intercepted. Merrill missed his layup, but Tony Gutierrez scored 
on a rebound with :32 left. Gutierrez also made his foul shot to give USDHS a 
41-39 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they started getting tentative, that allowed us to play the passing 
lanes," USDHS Coach Jim Tomey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita stayed tentative on its next possession. After Brad Finneran 
failed to get the ball inside to his brother Brian, he tossed up an 18-footer 
that missed badly. USDHS's Clint Cummings got the rebound and was fouled with 
three seconds left. He missed the front end of a one-and-one to give the Eagles 
one more chance. 
</P>
<P>
 After a timeout, Brian Finneran threw a baseball pass to Brian Scoggin, who 
threw up an off-balance turnaround jumper from 22 feet that hit the back of the 
rim. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, all DeBusk could think about was all the misses opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our best chance came when Merrill picked up his fourth foul with seven 
minutes left," DeBusk said. "I told our team, we had to make our run now. But 
we didn't capitalize." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles held Merrill, who averaged 21 points and 14 points, to 13 points 
and eight rebounds, but they couldn't handle the quickness of Gutierrez (14 
points, four rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
 "He hurt us with his drives and he made his free throws," Brad Finneran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Merrill: "They were collapsing on me so other guys had to step up. And 
they did, just like they have been all year." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Santa Margarita stepped up to the free throw line and shot mostly 
blanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to convert the free throws, but (Thursday) we just didn't do it," 
DeBusk said.

SAILORS EARN ANOTHER SHOT AT BREA-OLINDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICK McGRANE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First the good news: The Newport Harbor girls' basketball team has earned a 
spot in the Southern California Regional Division III championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonus prize? The Sailors get to face top-seeded Brea-Olinda, the same team 
that beat them by 30 in last week's Southern Section Division III-AA title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor paced by 16 points and 11 rebounds by senior guard Gina Heads, 
never trailed Thursday as the Sailors knocked off San Diego Section champion 
and second-seeded Santee Santana, 61-53. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not bad news, that's fantastic news," Newport Harbor Coach Shannon 
Jakosky said, referring to the Sailors' rematch with Brea-Olinda at Anaheim 
Arena at 9:30 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we played them in the finals last week, we came out and lost the game in 
the first three minutes. Our whole goal was to get back to The Pond. Now we've 
done that. Our kids are just thrilled to get to play Brea-Olinda again." 
</P>
<P>
 The rematch was made possible by the Sailors' stingy man-to-man defense, which 
limited Santana, San Diego County's top three-point shooting team, to just one 
three-point field goal. Cathy Bass, the leading three-point shooter in the San 
Diego Section, missed all eight of her three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main goal was to stay on top of their three-point shooters," said Heads, 
who had 14 points at halftime. "We knew that was their main game plan. But 
coming from Orange County, we're used to playing a lot of man-to-man defense. 
We were able to shut them down." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor (24-7), which scored just two points in the first quarter 
against Brea-Olinda, led 20-12 after one quarter.

OENNING, WOODBRIDGE DEFEAT SAN BERNARDINO; DIVISION II GIRLS: SENIOR SCORES A 
TEAM-HIGH 21 POINTS IN 84-63 VICTORY. WARRIORS FACE UNDEFEATED ALEMANY IN 
FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They applauded as she maneuvered through a throng of smiling teammates after 
leaving the game late in the fourth quarter, but still more seemed appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Jamie Oenning finally took her seat after receiving several hugs, 
high-fives and pats on the back, fans of the Woodbridge High girls' basketball 
team stood and kept clapping . . . and clapping . . . and clapping. 
</P>
<P>
 The standing ovation lasted several minutes, and that seemed only right after 
watching the standout senior guard score a team-high 21 points in leading 
Woodbridge to an 84-63 victory over San Bernardino in the semifinals of the 
Division II Southern California Regional on Thursday night at Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is absolutely a dream," Oenning said. "My whole career has been like a 
dream to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love these fans and I love this school. I couldn't have written a better 
ending to my last home game." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the Warriors' fans, Oenning still has at least one more game 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge (31-0), the Southern Section Division II-AA champion, will play 
Alemany (30-0), the division II-A champion, for the regional title at 1:30 p.m. 
Saturday at the Anaheim Arena. Alemany defeated San Diego Mission Bay, 68-51, 
in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino (26-7) lost to Alemany, 49-46, in the division title game. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time Woodbridge has advanced to the regional championship 
game, and Oenning is a big reason the Warriors are making the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Oenning, who also had six steals and four assists, scored 15 of her points in 
the first half. Oenning's shooting and passing sparked the Warriors' 15-2 
second-quarter run, which helped Woodbridge lead, 44-30, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore forward Melanie Pearson (20 points, 13 rebounds) increased the lead 
to 21 points, 51-30, on a pass from Oenning with 6 minutes 30 seconds remaining 
in the third quarter. Warrior freshman guard Erin Stovall also played well in 
the quarter, scoring eight of her 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors' lead eventually grew to 23 points, 57-34. San Bernardino, 
however, would not quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by their quick, talented backcourt of La Tonya Kindle (23 points) and La 
Cresha Flannigan (16 points), the Cardinals went on a 10-0 run to cut the lead 
to 13 points, 57-44. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cardinals would get no closer because they had problems getting the 
ball . 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge had a 45-30 advantage in rebounding for the game. The Warriors 
controlled the game in the fourth quarter and the Cardinals became frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Celeste Gude, San Bernardino's powerful 6-feet-6 center, was removed from the 
game with 2:07 left and Woodbridge leading by 25, 81-56. Gude, who averages 13 
points and 13 rebounds, had 10 points and seven rebounds.

BREA-OLINDA EASILY GETS FINAL BERTH; DIVISION III GIRLS: ERICKSON SCORES 26 
POINTS AS LADYCATS GET 86-33 VICTORY AGAINST SAN LUIS OBISPO. 
</P>

<P>
 For once, Nicole Erickson was not in control. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting an emotional battle in her final game in her home gym, the four-year 
starter for three-time State champion Brea-Olinda turned out to be a softie. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson was practically in tears from the time she stepped off the floor with 
seven minutes left in the game, the crowd of about 700 giving her a 45-second 
standing ovation, until well after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson scored 26 as Brea defeated San Luis Obispo in the Division II 
Southern Regional semifinal, 86-33, Thursday. The Ladycats (31-0) face Newport 
Harbor at 9:30 a.m. Saturday at Anaheim Arena. It will be a rematch of last 
week's Southern Section final in which Brea-Olinda scored a 70-40 victory. 
Newport beat Santee Santana, 63-51. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson, who shot 47% from the field during the regular season, had been in a 
15-of-57 slump (26.3%) the past three games, but she made her first five 
attempts and eight of her first nine. She finished nine of 11, but one miss 
occurred when she threw the ball at the basket as the halftime buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult to control my emotions," Erickson said. "I think we should 
just let it go. Look -- I'm crying again." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was her last night to play on her home court and she went all out," 
sophomore guard Kiyoko Miller said. "She was awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson scored from every angle, dished off six assists, and had four steals 
and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 She had 22 points at halftime and Brea had a 48-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 San Luis Obispo showed patience on offense and trailed, 10-6, with 3 minutes 
16 seconds left in the first quarter. Then the unthinkable happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea scored 42 consecutive points with Erickson getting 22 of them. The 
largest lead of the game was 61 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Hudson scored 12 points and grabbed four rebounds after missing the 
Regional first-round game with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Said San Luis Obispo Coach Dean Treanor: "They're better than I thought. The 
tough thing about getting a scouting report on them is that everyone tells you 
you don't have a chance. How do you tell your girls you don't have a chance? 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew their first quarter scores and we just wanted to stay with them. Then 
their talent took over." 
</P>
<P>
 Treanor said he was frustrated officials let the game get as physical as it 
did, especially with his nine-player team. He also was disappointed that Brea's 
starters opened up the second half and that they played in the opening minutes 
of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of respect for their program until I saw this," Treanor said. "I 
leave here without the same respect."

<P>
 Mike Elias is a sailor, not a figure skater, but Australia's Neville Wittey 
might consider wearing knee pads today when the two meet to conclude the first 
round robin of the Congressional Cup at Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Elias, who represents the host Long Beach Yacht Club, was still bitter after 
Thursday's racing about having Wednesday's victory over Steve Grillon taken 
away on a protest by Wittey, who was in a different race. 
</P>
<P>
 "In race-car circles, there's a Richard Petty, and here there's petty Wittey," 
Elias said at the postrace news conference. "I'm going to race him in the 
morning and that's going to be a lot of fun."  
</P>
<P>
 Elias, like most locals, has been overmatched by the world-class competitors 
in five previous Congressionals. So it hurts to have any victory taken away, 
especially on a protest by someone in another match. RICH ROBERTS

 Shawna Robinson became the first woman to win a Grand National stock car 
racing pole Thursday as she led the opening round of qualifying for Saturday's 
Busch Light 300 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, the second-fastest qualifier a week ago at Richmond, Va., beat 
former Grand National champion Joe Nemechek for the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the only woman to win either a race or a pole in a NASCAR touring 
series, having won a 1988 NASCAR Dash Series event and three Dash Series poles 
in 1989.

<P>
 Robinson failed to qualify in four of 28 races in 1993, her first full season 
on the Grand National circuit.

<P>
 Robinson's Chevrolet Lumina turned a lap at 174.330 m.p.h. on the 1.522-mile

Brewing Co., claiming his likeness was used without his permission in one of 
the brewery's magazine ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcombe, 67, alleges in the suit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court 
that an ad for Killian's Red Beer in the Feb. 14 Sports Illustrated resembles a 
photograph taken of him in the 1950s. A Coors spokesman said the company was 
assured by the ad agency that the art was original.

 FACING OFF: A tagger who spray-painted a high school will be among the 
speakers at a victim/offender gathering tonight at Chapman University, along 
with one of the school's officials . . . . The Victim Offender Reconciliation 
Program, a private group in Orange, is marking at the event its 1,000th case of 
bringing together criminals and their victims. But program director Mike 
Niemeyer says the discussions will be low-key: "People are just going to tell 
stories. We aren't going to editorialize. Just let the audience take them for 
what they are."

 MOSCOW CRUSH? Striking a more convivial tone as he continues his visit to 
Russia (A9), former President Richard Nixon reminisced about his previous stays 
in Moscow, not to mention time spent on Southern California highways. At a 
reception on Thursday, he noted that traffic is much fiercer than when he 
stayed in the Kremlin as the guest of Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. "It's 
worse than the Santa Ana Freeway," he said. 
</P>

 ART LESSON: Local artist Emigdio Vasquez is known for his many outdoor murals 
in the Anaheim area depicting daily barrio life. But you can also see what 
matters to Vasquez through his current 25-painting exhibit at the Anaheim 
Museum, which will run through March 19. Several of those pieces, which range 
from $600 to $3,000, have already sold. Says the museum's Darrell L. Ament: 
"Mr. Vasquez's paintings remind me of the rich cultural diversity of Anaheim's 
history."

 JUNIOR TEE OFF: Every year the major golf companies band together for a major 
convention in Anaheim, to promote the latest in equipment and apparel and the 
game itself. This year's three-day event, which starts this afternoon at the 
Anaheim Convention Center, is trying for a wider audience. It will include a 
Saturday afternoon seminar for junior golfers. Among the hosts: Teen-agers Ted 
Oh of Torrance, who played in last year's U.S. Open, and Kellee Booth of Coto 
de Caza, the current junior women's champ.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; PAYING THE HIGH PRICE TO 
POLICE SCHOOLS

 As part of a plan to reduce violence at city schools, the Los Angeles Unified 
School District proposed hiring 22 additional campus police officers and 300 
campus security aides at a school safety hearing Monday. The extra security 
personnel -- tagged at a cost of $3.5 million a year -- would supplement the 
district's 295-member force and would place an officer at each high school and 
middle school campus. The recommendation comes in the wake of fatal shootings 
at Reseda and Fairfax high schools last year and the death of a Cleveland High 
School student shot while walking home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should the LAUSD spend $3.5 million to hire additional security officers for 
its campuses? 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Castro, chairwoman of the Los Angeles school board's School Safety 
Committee: 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe every secondary school needs a police officer. Every student has 
a right to a safe and clean school. My concern is that this is $25 million 
total for our school police. I think the Legislature needs to fund that above 
classroom dollars. . . . It's essential. In this day and age, you need a police 
officer just to take care of daily, routine things. I was very supportive of 
putting them in uniform. It is a deterrent." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kladifko, principal of Reseda High School, where a student was shot and 
killed last year: 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled by it. What we've done to try to give us campus aides is we 
have parent volunteers. But many of them work and can't come to campus. With 
funds the way they are, we just can't get more adults to the campus to help us 
supervise. . . . Just the fact that you have a uniformed officer on campus is a 
deterrent. The No. 1 issue for the Legislature and for us is to try to keep our 
campuses safe and secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Slavkin, Los Angeles school board member who organized the Emergency Task 
Force on Youth Violence following the two high school shootings: 
</P>
<P>
 "For those campuses (currently without police officers), it makes a big 
difference. It provides a greater sense of security for the students, teachers 
and parents. It doesn't make all the problems go away, but it's an important 
step forward. . . . In a community where the LAPD is too limited in its 
resources, it's essential. The law enforcement response is very important, but 
the other critical piece is to help the kids in our schools. Police alone and 
metal detectors alone are not going to change the conditions under which kids 
grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Rivera, assistant to Supt. Sid Thompson, who proposed the increase in 
school security: 
</P>
<P>
 "It will improve the conditions of safety at the individual school campuses. 
The additional police officers could (allow the district to place) one officer 
at each of the district's senior and middle schools. . . . The aides will 
provide a large number of personnel who will be providing a patrol for the 
school. We do believe that there will be a significant improvement in school 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Bennett, principal of Parkman Middle School in Woodland Hills, which does 
not have an officer assigned to the campus: 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a good idea. It would be an extra pair of eyes (on campus). . . . 
In most cases, the problems really come from outsiders. If they see someone in 
a uniform, they're not about to do some of the stuff they could do. . . . 
Schools have the same problems as everybody else. I think we do a fairly good 
job considering the limits on our time. The more adults the kids see on campus, 
the less likely they are to do nonsense. . . . The kids want 'em, the parents 
want 'em, the staff wants 'em."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: ROBBINS ANYTHING BUT WELCOME IN OLD POLITICAL NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>

 KNOCK, KNOCK: Former state Sen. Alan Robbins just happened to be in the 
neighborhood of the 20th Senate District office in Van Nuys so he decided to 
drop by. And why not? After all, Robbins carried the flag for the district for 
nearly two decades while voters returned him time and again to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 On this recent day, however, Robbins was on leave from the halfway house in 
Hollywood where he has been staying since his release from federal prison in 
Lompoc. And the folks in the 20th District office were not crazy about seeing 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, the current occupant of the Senate seat, Democrat David A. Roberti, 
is busily fighting a recall attempt. And the last thing Roberti needs is for 
Robbins -- convicted on political corruption and tax evasion charges -- to try 
to renew an old friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's challengers are already trying to make an issue out of Robbins, and 
the fact that Roberti had tapped him many years ago to chair the Senate 
Insurance Committee. During his tenure as committee chairman, Robbins got 
himself into trouble by extorting money from people in exchange for legislative 
favors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either he (Roberti) knew about it and was corrupt, or he didn't know about it 
and was inept," said Dolores White, a GOP candidate trying to unseat Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti maintains he was disappointed and disgusted by his former colleague's 
lawlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 It was against this backdrop that Robbins showed up the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The senator doesn't want to have anything to do with him," said Staci 
Walters, Roberti's campaign communications director. "He feels like he was 
deceived." 
</P>

 FAILED ATTACK: Peter Repovich, the LAPD officer seeking the Republican 
nomination for the state Assembly seat formerly held by Pat Nolan, bombed 
Wednesday night when he attacked his chief Republican adversary, Municipal 
Judge James Rogan, before a crowd of some 250 GOP stalwarts. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to a mini-convention of Glendale and Burbank Republicans, Repovich 
denounced Rogan as a Johnny-come-lately convert to the GOP who in fact had been 
a top activist in the Democratic Party during the Ronald Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Rogan only joined the GOP in 1988. True, he had been a member of the 
California Democratic Party Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of that bothered the Glendale-Burbank Republicans who eagerly lapped 
up the judge's fire-and-brimstone rhetoric Wednesday about Democratic lawmakers 
who despise "moral absolutes" and mollycoddle criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating Repovich's flanking attack, Rogan produced a handwritten 1989 
letter from former President Reagan, praising him for his new-found GOP 
allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
 If that wasn't enough, one Republican conventioneer jumped up to wave a copy 
of a voter registration document showing that Repovich had been a Democrat 
himself before joining the GOP in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Musurlian, an aide to U.S. Rep. Carlos Moorhead, another candidate for 
the Nolan seat, also berated Repovich, who reportedly has raised $350,000 for 
his campaign and hired a New York-based consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter, you're paying an awful lot of money for bad advice to take shots at a 
guy who has served his community very well," Musurlian told an approving crowd 
after Repovich attacked Rogan. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the numbers told the story: Rogan got 65 of 78 votes cast by the 
official delegates to the mini-convention and Repovich got none. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the debacle, Repovich was undeterred. "The 43rd District is bigger 
than this convention," he said afterward. As for Musurlian, he said he would 
bow out for unity's sake. 
</P>

 SAY WHAT? Mayor Richard Riordan, this city's most often quoted 
speaker-in-training, has once again found himself explaining comments that he 
says were misinterpreted. The problem is that this time he may have to explain 
the explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Reseda on a tour of Councilwoman Laura Chick's 3rd District, the 
mayor stopped by her district office to chat with city employees and answer 
questions of business leaders, school supervisors and others. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first questions came from a city employee who wanted to know if 
they can expect a raise next year. The mayor said it would be unlikely, 
considering the city's financial problems and his plan to add more police 
officers. But he said he was committed to protecting city jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when another employee -- obviously dissatisfied with his answer -- 
jumped in. "Wasn't there an article in the paper yesterday where you were 
quoted as saying we get paid too much?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan hesitated, then launched his explanation. "Uh . . . you get paid . . . 
I don't know . . . That was done in a very informal setting where they got that 
and let me just say this: That's not what I said. What I said is that city 
employees get significantly more than the private sector and that is one reason 
why your jobs should be protected because you couldn't maintain your standard 
of living in the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me? 
</P>

 CLOSING RANKS: The Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. this week obliquely 
supported state Sen. David Roberti in his bid to beat back a recall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 VICA, the Valley's preeminent business group, denounced the April 12 recall 
election as a waste of money (the registrar-recorder/county clerk has estimated 
the special election costs will exceed $800,000) and pledged to seek a change 
in state law to prohibit recalls from being launched against lawmakers during 
the last year of their term unless the recall advocates prepay the cost of the 
special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Term limits, it will be remembered, will force Roberti to step down from his 
Senate seat in December anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, VICA stopped short of blessing Roberti himself, perhaps a distinction 
that's too fine to be appreciated by many observers. "We're not endorsing 
Roberti as a person, we don't do that," said VICA leader David Fleming. It can 
be expected that VICA's position will be fully aired in a campaign mailer to 
voters from Roberti. Likewise, the views of two north Valley Republicans in 
good standing -- Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson and ex-congresswoman 
Bobbi Fiedler, who are also giving aid and comfort to the embattled senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiedler's position is that the recall is wrong-headed because it is a waste of 
tax dollars, while Bernson's position has fewer shadings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hal believes the Mr. Roberti has been a dedicated and effective lawmaker, but 
more importantly we also believe it is big waste of tax money to hold a special 
election when the senator is only eight months away from leaving office 
anyway," said Bernson aide Francine Oschin.

 Rostenkowski case -- A story that appeared Tuesday in The Times said that 
prosecutors conducting a grand jury investigation into the financial affairs of 
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) had remained on the case despite the change from 
a Republican to a Democratic Administration.The top attorney, U.S. Atty. Jay 
Stephens, was replaced by U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr. after President Clinton 
took office. However, the career prosecutors conducting the day-to-day 
investigation remain the same.

PANEL REJECTS BID TO MAKE U.S. PAY PRISON COSTS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A California lawmaker failed in an attempt to ease the financial burden of 
state by making the federal government pay for imprisoning illegal immigrants 
who commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) advocated a proposal to require the 
federal government to either imprison illegal immigrants convicted of felonies 
or reimburse states for the costs of jailing them. But the bill failed on a 
procedural point in a House Judiciary subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman, however, did win approval of a provision that would require the 
attorney general to consider the number of illegals in state prisons when 
making grants to states to help keep violent, repeat offenders behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a modest first step, but we're going to make bigger steps before this 
process is finished," Berman said afterward. He said that he would seek support 
from the Clinton Administration for additional federal payments to offset state 
costs for dealing with illegal immigrants who commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 California alone now pays $375 million a year to imprison 18,112 illegal 
immigrants, Berman told members of the House Judiciary subcommittee on 
intellectual property and judicial administration. "It's an enormous drain," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) strongly endorsed Berman's plan, arguing 
that the federal government "is not picking up its share of the load." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) regarded as a leading Republican spokesman on law 
enforcement issues, also backed Berman's original proposal to make the federal 
government responsible for imprisonment of alien felons. 
</P>
<P>
 But the provision was killed on a point of order raised by Rep. William J. 
Hughes (D-N.J.) who objected that Berman's amendment was not germane to the 
bill's main purpose: helping states pay for the cost of long-term incarceration 
of violent criminals with multiple convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Hughes agreed that states have been shortchanged by federal failure 
to control immigration. "I think it's disgraceful we haven't provided funds." 
Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee approved a bill to authorize $3 billion over the next five 
years for federal grants to states to help pay for life imprisonment for 
violent felons convicted for the third time under "three strikes laws" recently 
approved by California and other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the subcommittee narrowly rejected, 8 to 7, a proposal by McCollum, 
to authorize $10 billion in federal grants to states on condition that all 
state prisoners serve at least 85% of their sentences.

OCEAN VIEW SEES STAR IN HUGHEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a sophomore, Miles Hughey couldn't hack it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't ready physically," Ocean View Coach Steve Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started off good and had a game-winning hit in my first game," Hughey said. 
"But I played shaky defense and I got sent down to the JVs." 
</P>
<P>
 But after spending the rest of the 1992 season with the junior varsity and 
then working all summer to improve, Hughey won the starting shortstop job last 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 And he started producing. He hit .410 with 29 runs batted in last season, 
helping the Seahawks reach the Southern Section Division I quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Hughey has drawn the attention of professional baseball scouts.  
</P>
<P>
 Barrett said there are plenty of reasons the scouts like Hughey. 
</P>
<P>
 They like the senior's 6-foot, broad-shouldered, 185-pound frame and the speed 
that comes with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's unbelievable from home to first," Barrett said. "He can flat out run." 
</P>
<P>
 And he can hit. Hughey batted .410 with 29 RBIs last season. "He has a little 
bit of power, too," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 And his defense has improved dramatically since his sophomore season. "Miles 
has good hands and feet, a strong arm, and he's a smart player who plays real 
hard. He has some intangibles," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the best players in the county right now. Shortstops like Miles, 
with a little pop in their bat, are always in high demand." 
</P>
<P>
 But last season, Hughey was just another bat in the Seahawks' potent lineup 
that featured five players who hit .400 or better. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rivera hit .518, scored 30 runs, drove in 22 runs and stole 32 bases in 
the regular season. Mike Bellovich hit .468 and drove in 37 runs; Justin 
Brunette hit .440 with 24 RBIs, and Jeff Buchanan hit .414 in the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Hughey is the lone returner and he might be a marked man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I try too hard and swing at the pitcher's pitch," Hughey said. "I 
put pressure on myself to produce for the team, but I know there are other 
sticks in the lineup. I'll take that free base any day." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett hopes he can find someone to produce behind Hughey. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still looking for a guy to protect Miles so they won't pitch around 
him," Barrett said. "The guys hitting behind Miles will have to keep the 
pitchers honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughey hopes his Seahawks will be able to knock off preseason favorites 
Fountain Valley, Edison, and Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 And he knows the early-season rankings -- Marina is listed 11th in the nation 
by USA Today, Edison sixth in the county, and Fountain Valley ninth in the 
county -- don't amount to much. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were No. 1 after we won the Loara tournament last season," Hughey said. 
"Then we finished third in league.  
</P>
<P>
 "We won't be intimidated when we play them," he said. "We'll be competitive, 
and they'll have to come and beat us." 1993 / IN REVIEW

Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Brian Ponchak, now with USC, won league co-MVP honors after leading 
Fountain Valley to the league championship. The Barons advanced to the second 
round of the Southern Section Division I playoffs, but were eliminated by 
Sherman Oaks Notre Dame, 6-5. . . . Pitcher Todd Belitz of Edison, who shared 
league MVP honors with Ponchak, helped the Chargers reach the second round of 
the playoffs, where they lost to eventual Division I champion Esperanza, 2-0. . 
. . Ocean View, the third-place team, defeated Glendale Hoover, 9-7, in the 
second round. But the Seahawks lost in the quarterfinals to Encino Crespi, 4-2.

<P>
 The biggest addition to Westminster's lineup is Montgomery, a junior transfer 
from Fountain Valley. Montgomery had 29 runs batted during the regular season 
to help the Barons win the league championship. Montgomery will hit third in 
the lineup, pitch and play third base. He had five hits in Westminster's first 
two games, a 7-6 loss to Long Beach Jordan and a 7-2 victory over Bolsa Grande. 
Matlock returns to play shortstop after hitting .325 in a half-season last 
year. He missed the second half last season after a pitched ball broke his his 
hand. Valles led off last season and hit .365. Rodriguez returns at catcher and 
will alternate hitting fourth or fifth with Glasby, who had 24 RBIs for the 
junior varsity team, which finished 17-6 last season. But Batesole will depend 
on defense to keep the Lions close. Said Batesole: "If everybody stays healthy 
and Sorensen, Montgomery, Torres and Berumen give us solid pitching, we could 
make a run at a playoff berth."

 Brian Ponchak, the co-MVP of the league last season, is now at USC. But his 
younger brother, Chris, picked up where he left off by hitting a grand slam and 
recording a save in the Barons' 5-4 victory over Marina in the quarterfinals of 
the Loara tournament Tuesday. Chris Ponchak, Keller, Hudson, Perkins, and 
Liuzzi are the five pitchers competing for positions in the starting rotation. 
Hoppie and Roman, both second-team all-league selections last season, should 
play prominent roles on offense. LaRuffa hopes Yanagisawa will also drive in 
runs and said Burford is one of the best young hitters in the county. "We have 
some young kids who would have played more last year but we had such a dominant 
senior class," LaRuffa said. "We should be near the top of our league, but it 
will be tough. There are no breathers in this league."

 Hard-throwing right handers Jon Ward (Cal State Fullerton) and Ryan Brannan 
(Miami) have led the Oilers in the past two seasons, and now it's Dillard's 
turn. Dillard doesn't fit the profile physically--he pitches left-handed and is 
6-foot-2, 175 pounds--but Dodd hopes Dillard can lead the staff. "He's not a 
strikeout pitcher, but we don't want him to try to strike everybody out," Dodd 
said. "We want him to get the ball to guys who will make the plays for us." One 
of those players is shortstop Daedelow, a three-year starter and first-team 
all-league selection. Center fielder Yadrick, who played running back for the 
football team, is also a key defensive player. "I'm a little nervous about this 
season," Dodd said. "We have a good little ball club, but the league is so 
strong. But we always know that in a 14-game league season, the most talented 
team may not always win it."

 Tereschuk takes over after spending the past seven seasons as coach at 
Whittier California, where he won one league championship. Tereschuk, the 
younger brother of Laguna Hills Coach Pete Tereschuk, played for the University 
of San Diego, then worked as an assistant at Long Beach Wilson. "We'll be solid 
on defense," Tereschuk said. "We have a good pitching staff and some decent 
speed." Miedecke has established himself as the staff ace, pitching a 
four-hitter with 11 strikeouts in the Friars' 4-2 victory over Anaheim Tuesday. 
Krotz, who had a home run in the victory, and Rossi give Servite stability up 
the middle. Tereschuk hopes Greene, Shaia and Berlanga can contribute 
offensively. "I'm not interested in what happened last year," Tereschuk said. 
"I just want us to improve."

 Gildea and Hughey are two reasons Barrett says the Seahawks can crack into the 
top three in the league. Gildea finished the regular season with an 8-1 record 
and a 1.44 earned-run average, then won two playoff games to help the Seahawks 
advance to the quarterfinals. Hughey batted fifth last season and is regarded 
as one of the best shortstops in the county. "I think we'll be the best 
defensive team in the league," Barrett said. Churchill (.360) and Foreman 
(.320) return to provide good gloves on the infield. Delachica, who started 
eight games in the outfield as a freshman, and sophomore pitcher Carr are two 
young players Barrett hopes will contribute immediately. "Cory Carr's going to 
win a lot of games for us," Barrett said. That is, if the Seahawks can generate 
enough offense. Ocean View averaged five hits in its first three games.

 Although the Vikings were ranked 11th in the nation is USA Today's preseason 
poll, they were unranked in the Orange County poll. Fountain Valley, ranked 
ninth in Orange County, beat Marina, 5-4, in the quarterfinals of the Loara 
tournament Tuesday. Renfrow said he hopes Sailor and Sipkovich will step up as 
seniors to lead Marina in the tough Sunset League. "If the pitching stays 
healthy, it could be a good year," Renfrow said. The rest of the team isn't bad 
either, with eight starters returning.

 The Chargers return four starters from last season's Sunset runner-up team, 
including two of the league's best pitchers. Belitz, the team's best 
power-hitter, is a hard-throwing lefty who shared league MVP honors with 
Fountain Valley pitcher Brian Ponchak. Surdock, a second-team all-league 
selection last season, also plays shortstop. "There's not a better 1-2 
combination than Belitz and Surdock," Huntington Beach Coach Mike Dodd said. 
And Barilla, another lefty, gives the Chargers added depth. Said Harrell: "Of 
our 21 victories last year, we have pitchers coming back that had 16 of those." 
Hanoian returns at the top of the lineup after earning first-team all-league 
honors as a sophomore. Robert Caton, a first-team all-league third baseman, 
graduated but Keyser will try to replace him. "We have the potential for a good 
year," Harrell said. Sunset coaches agree, pegging Fountain Valley, Edison and 
Marina as the favorites.

 Nelson didn't have a banner first year as the Saints failed to win a league 
game. "We had a tough season," Nelson said. "We had a bunch of injuries and 
ineligibilities. We never had the same group together." It didn't start out any 
easier this season for Santa Ana because the Saints first scrimmaged Dana 
Hills, then opened the season against Capistrano Valley. Dana Hills and 
Capistrano Valley are the No. 1 and 2 teams in the county and feature two of 
the nation's top high-school pitching prospects, Seth Etherton and Pete Zamora. 
"We saw Etherton and Zamora back-to-back," Nelson said. "But I told our kids 
that lots of teams aren't going to get a lot of hits against them." The Saints 
managed only two against Zamora and Capistrano Valley, but the Saints will have 
to manufacture runs against everyone this season. Mata is a three-year starter 
and Fausto returns in center field.
