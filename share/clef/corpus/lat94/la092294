 TRASH TRIUMPH: East Ventura County residents are applauding a decision by 
Waste Management not to truck trash from the city of Oceanside to the Simi 
Valley Landfill (B6) . . . It's the latest go-round in a game of who gets trash 
from where. Though the Simi Valley dump has escaped the clutches of its 
neighbor to the south, Oceanside still has its eye on sites in Lancaster, 
Bradley and the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 KICKING BARRIERS: They may be best friends, but when it comes to playing 
football it's every girl for herself. . . . Chrissy Sanford kicks for the 
Newbury Park High School football team and Joy Barry does the same for rival 
Thousand Oaks High (C8). . . . The 16-year-old juniors are part of a statewide 
trend -- 71 girls played varsity football in California last year, more than 
five times as many as in 1991. . . . Their skill on the field has snuffed some 
of the skepticism from spectators -- and teammates. Said Joy: "They've come to 
respect what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 COVER OF NIGHT: Some cyclists have discovered a new way to hit the road: after 
dark. (Ventura County Life, Page 8) . . . Mountain bike riders are taking to 
Ventura County trails at nightfall -- but with powerful battery-operated lamps 
to light the way. . . . Aside from the danger of riding into unseen objects -- 
say, a cow -- night riding offers special rewards. "It's so cool and quiet," 
said Paul Sailor of Ventura. "All you hear are crickets and the wind in the 
trees." 
</P>
<P>
 FIT AS A FIDDLE: For some exercise buffs, bulging biceps aren't everything. . 
. . That's why Shana Sable of Simi Valley gave up bodybuilding competitions a 
few years ago for a new kind of contest: fitness shows. Sable won a regional 
competition of Ms. Fitness America, and will represent California at the 
nationals in November. . . . Contestants are judged on -- you guessed it -- 
fitness, as well as strength, coordination and flexibility. Sable, 30, believes 
the popularity of the hybrid sport is growing. "It's definitely appealing to 
the masses."

DOWN SO LONG LOOKS LIKE UP?; MAYBE, BUT UCLA FORECAST SURELY IS WELCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is that really good news we're seeing or are we just glad not to be seeing so 
much bad news? 
</P>
<P>
 The newest data indicates California is in a recovery mode, so for a moment 
forget everything you may have heard to the contrary. Although the comeback is 
slow and uneven in such categories as employment, the UCLA Business Forecasting 
Project points to a net increase of 111,000 jobs by year's end. Maybe that's 
not the second coming of prosperity but the UCLA forecast is a surprising 
reversal from the June report, which predicted a 0.1% drop in employment for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the aerospace layoffs expected from the Martin Marietta-Lockheed 
merger and Hughes Aircraft's virtual shutdown of its Fullerton complex, 
California will "not go back into recession," according to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that, we submit, is something. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all parts of the state are experiencing improvement. There are good 
developments in Orange County, where the unemployment rate dropped to 5.9% in 
August from 6.6% the month before. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County, alas, is not expected to have job growth until at least 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the northern and central parts of California are faring better 
than the south. Still, California's overall unemployment rate is expected to 
fall from about 9% -- which is nearly three percentage points above the 
national rate -- to 7% in 1997 because of new jobs and slower growth in the 
labor force. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the state's renewed vibrancy will come from small entrepreneurial 
businesses. The cost of doing business here is still too high and efforts to 
reduce expenses and cut red tape must continue. In this regard, a little relief 
is in sight. The California Department of Insurance is enacting its biggest 
reduction ever in workers' compensation rates, slashing by 16% the base 
premiums paid by businesses to insure their employees against on-the-job 
injuries. The reduction is expected to create a one-time savings of about $800 
million for thousands of California employers who purchase workers' 
compensation coverage. The rate cut -- the third in 15 months -- stems from a 
big drop in worker injury claims since long-awaited reforms of workers' comp 
became law.  
</P>
<P>
 And that too, we submit, is not nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 True, structural changes in aerospace and other California industries will 
continue to slow the state's recovery. The road back will be bumpy, because the 
wave of downsizing in large companies, utilities and financial institutions is 
not over. 
</P>
<P>
 And new uncertainties loom: jittery financial markets, the prospect of another 
interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve Board and a slowing national economy. 
</P>
<P>
 So it not surprising that Californians do not feel secure in the idea that 
things are becoming better. But it seems like this time, at long last, things 
really are looking up.

INNER-CITY WATCH; HELP WANTED

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a sad and disturbing commentary on urban conditions when anyone can look 
at the landing of U.S. troops in Haiti and wish, even for a moment, even only 
half-seriously, that those troops were deployed instead on the streets of 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James Mays, head of Unity Survival Action for South-Central Los Angeles, 
this week called for an attack, of sorts, on the problems plaguing the area.He 
suggested that former President Jimmy Carter and retired Gen. Colin L. Powell 
come "out here and talk to gangbangers and criminals and tell them they're 
coming to reinforce the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Mays no doubt was using the hyperbole of the moment to make a symbolic point: 
The problems here at home are daunting too, and political leaders need to pay 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 That's certainly true. Government too often looks the other way rather than 
deal with the deep problems of poverty, discrimination and crime. Some of 
America's urban problems are out of control. But what mustn't get lost in the 
discussion is that some parts of life here still remain in the control of the 
people.  
</P>
<P>
 People here can and should demand something of their political 
representatives. They can work in large and small ways, as Mays and countless 
others do daily, to make life better. Many are doing that at block club 
meetings. Through community projects. At local schools. In sports leagues. In 
scout troops. By pooling financial resources. This description of urban America 
is no description of paradise. But it's no description of Haiti, either.

DESERT BILL -- A MESSY ANTICLIMAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enough is enough. In the hope of derailing the California Desert Protection 
Act in the fading days of the congressional session, a small band of Republican 
senators is engaged in yet another stalling tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years have passed since the bill was introduced. It has been compromised 
to meet almost every objection. It is favored by the vast majority of 
Californians and endorsed by nearly every newspaper in the state, and it passed 
both houses of Congress with bipartisan support. So why do a few Republicans 
want to kill it by preventing a conference from ironing out differences between 
Senate and House versions? 
</P>
<P>
 They say the bill, which would protect about 8 million acres of fragile 
desert, would overburden the already strapped National Park Service. But we 
suspect the real reason is different. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's chief sponsor in the Senate is Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat in a 
tough reelection race against Rep. Mike Huffington. Some Republicans want to 
deny her the right to tout passage of the act in the campaign's final weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate leadership has now scheduled a cloture vote, possibly as early as 
today. Feinstein believes she has the 60 votes needed to shut off any 
filibuster and send the bill to conference. An alternative is a possible deal 
between Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), chairman of the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee, and the panel's ranking Republican, Malcolm Wallop of 
Wyoming. Wallop would accept the bill only with certain amendments that would 
benefit his home state. Johnston would add a New Orleans jazz park and other 
goodies for Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 We oppose such last-minute pork-loading. All sides have had ample time to 
shape the bill. The chief price of cloture probably would be that Feinstein 
would have to accept an odious House-imposed provision making the East Mojave 
Scenic Area a preserve rather than a full park, thus allowing hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a disgraceful, messy anticlimax to years of hard work. One does not 
have to be a Feinstein supporter to see that the act is an investment in 
preserving California's natural heritage for posterity. The intolerable 
parliamentary guerrilla warfare being waged against this landmark legislation 
must come to an end.

DISCOVERY OF CANCER GENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I'm writing to clarify one point in an otherwise excellent article on the 
discovery of BRCA1, the first inherited breast cancer gene to be identified. 
Although, women who inherit this gene have a tendency to have earlier onset of 
breast cancer, and ovarian cancer, a large proportion of the women who get 
breast cancer from BRCA1 are not under age 30. Many women in these families 
were 50 or older before developing cancer. As we become able to test 
individuals and families, I feel certain that it will be found that most or all 
cases occur after age 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriate families for genetic counseling and testing are those with several 
relatives with breast, ovarian or related cancers. A genetic counselor can 
determine, based on family history, if gene testing is appropriate. While the 
testing may be a year or more away, some people may wish counseling sooner. A 
common misunderstanding is that genes for breast cancer are inherited only 
through the mother's side. The genes for familial breast and colon cancers can 
be inherited through the mother or the father, so analysis should include a 
complete history of both sides of the family.

 * In science, it is a dictum that discoveries spawn more questions. Ellen 
Goodman (Commentary, Sept. 18) would have had us wait for the discovery of the 
breast cancer gene; she now wants us to wait for the cure. I suggest that we 
should not simply "wait." It is equally critical, in the interim, to attempt to 
resolve the many ethical, legal and financial issues that all scientific 
discoveries bring to the forefront. We can use the available time to reach a 
consensus on such diverse and divisive issues as: a) ethical considerations for 
procreation, if we know that the offspring will be subject to a 
life-threatening condition; b) availability of health insurance coverage for 
those known to be carriers of suspect genes; c) privacy considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible to sit back and complain, instead, that we want to avoid 
scientific progress, if we are not ready for it.

GANG PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I very much appreciate the commentary of state Sen. Gary Hart, "Prisons Over 
Schools: Formula for Failure" (Sept. 6). As an individual who grew up in East 
Los Angeles, I have been acutely aware of the gang problem all my life. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 20 years I have closely observed gang issues and worked closely 
with gang projects. Sen. Hart's comments are very accurate. I would like to 
take them one step further. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything the criminal justice system does reinforces the gang problem 
because the gang mentality is a stance against the mainstream culture. Going to 
prison is a "badge of courage" for a gang member. That's why even though the 
prison system continuously utilizes a bigger portion of the state budget, there 
are more and more gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The gang problem has reached the level of a social catastrophe. That's why we 
of the Coalition for the Transformation of South Central L.A. are creating 
responses to the gang problem which offer possibility to gang members and 
at-risk youth. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone would like information about the coalition's projects, please call 
us at (800) 959-3950.

JOB SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Job Security? It's Just an Illusion," Commentary, Sept. 19: In 
criticizing the doctrine of "at-will employment," Reginald Alleyne frequently 
mentions that employment at will is dead in other industrialized nations. By 
this, one can assume he means primarily the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 What he does not mention is that unemployment in the EU averages over 11% of 
the work force, as opposed to 6% here. Most economists agree that one of the 
reasons for the fact that, even during a recession, U.S. unemployment levels 
never approach European levels is the flexibility of American labor laws, 
specifically the facility with which employers can hire and fire workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing our employment system, a system that has consistently given us the 
lowest unemployment in the Western World seems nothing short of insane.

HAITI INVASION AVERTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Bill Clinton was lucky (Sept. 19). We were lucky. But he has no reason to 
celebrate. The Haiti policy was a disaster and we should never have gotten to 
the point where the reputation of the United States depended upon us doing 
something we should never, ever do. 
</P>
<P>
 Just because we achieved something at the point of a gun does not mean it is 
right, moral or OK. There is a vast difference between using diplomatic 
pressure and military force. The failure of diplomatic pressure does not 
justify military force. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his advisers evidently do not understand this. I hope Congress 
starts an immediate inquiry into Clinton's Haiti policy. Heads should roll.

<P>
 * Now that the invasion of Haiti has been averted, but the intervention has 
begun, it is time to consider what principles ought to guide our foreign policy 
in similar cases in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 To judge by the volume of criticism aimed at the President, it would seem that 
the only legitimate use of our armed forces is where we have a vital national 
interest at stake. But have we honestly thought through what that means? 
</P>
<P>
 On the West Bank of the Jordan, Norwegian troops put their lives at risk in 
the cause of peace between Palestinians and Israelis. Pakistani soldiers served 
and died alongside Americans in Somalia. Bangladesh -- Bangladesh! -- is 
contributing what forces it can to Haiti. Those countries have no conceivable 
interest, let alone a vital national interest, in any of these places. 
</P>
<P>
 The term national interest is diplomatic language for "What is in it for me?" 
Is it to be American policy that while we will fight and sacrifice where we 
have something to lose or to gain, we will leave it to countries like Norway, 
Pakistan and Bangladesh to bear the burden where "mere principles" like peace 
and freedom and human rights hang in the balance?

 * Anne-christine d'Adesky in her article "The Nightmare That Is Haiti: 
Gunshots in the Quiet of the Night" (Opinion, Sept. 18) is correct in 
describing the fear that the "elite" of Haiti are feeling, but wrong as to its 
source. Dead wrong. The elite are not, with some exceptions, supporters of 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the poor masses of Haiti; they are in bed with Raoul 
Cedras as they were with Jean-Claude Duvalier before him, and will be with 
anyone in power who will keep their businesses prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
 When revenge is in the air, the elite are not afraid of the ruling military 
killing those in prison, as d'Adesky implies, but fear the masses attacking the 
wealthy elite who have oppressed them for years. 
</P>
<P>
 I know about gunshots in the night. My father, Paul J. Alexander MD, in the 
wee hours of the morning of May 23, 1986, was shot to death as he lay asleep in 
Port-au-Prince. His crime, as part of a rural health project funded by the 
Agency for International Development, was working to have a semiautonomous 
government entity stock only inexpensive, useful pharmaceuticals like 
penicillin and digoxin, and not high-priced, high mark-up drugs. The elite 
families (and I use the term with disdain) didn't like this policy and as 
surely as the thugs who entered my parents' house that night, they pulled the 
trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is their turn; the poor my father dedicated his life to helping will 
have power, and the elite can now live in fear.

 * Re "Soldiers' Blood, to Fill a Vacuum" by Tom Clancy (Commentary, Sept. 15): 
Once again we are treated to amateur soldier Clancy and his fictional account 
of U.S. military policy. This time he is attacking President Clinton, with whom 
he shares the distinction of never having been in the real U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
 Clancy's criticism of Clinton's plan to invade Haiti would be more believable 
if his memory were not so faulty regarding the Reagan/Bush Caribbean gunboat 
diplomacy he holds up as justifiable. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican gunboat diplomacy can be just as stupid as that of the Democrats. 
Clearly, we have two amateurs -- Clinton and Clancy -- vying for air time.

HAITI WATCH: WHAT'S NEXT NOW?; CLASH OF TWO CULTURES AS U.S. FORCES SETTLE IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The political washing machine that is the Administration's Haiti policy 
proceeded apace Wednesday: load, agitate, spin. 
</P>
<P>
 After threatening invasion, then managing to avoid it, then ordering U.S. 
troops to land, only to see them stand by amid continued brutality, President 
Clinton now says he will not tolerate more violence in Haiti. Right move. 
</P>
<P>
 CEDRAS WATCH: Haitian authorities were up to their usual dirty business. They 
used bats, whips and tear gas to terrorize crowds who gathered Tuesday to cheer 
the arrival of U.S. troops. No surprise there. The arrival of those troops 
didn't deter the thugs. One man was clubbed to death while reporters took notes 
and the American military personnel stayed back. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing by idly is not an American tradition, but the rules of engagement set 
by last weekend's deal between Washington and the junta called for U.S. troops 
to use force only in self-defense or to prevent a massive threat to Haitian 
stability. Crowd control and other policing chores were to be left to Haitian 
authorities. The unchecked brutality, which was not part of that bargain, 
prompted a warranted clarification of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 So U.S. Secretary of Defense William J. Perry announced Wednesday that more 
than 1,000 American military police will oversee Haitian police; the U.S. 
police, and human rights monitors, will arrive shortly. Establishing order and 
discipline will pose a huge challenge given the Haitian authorities' sordid 
history. But Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras has been told to rein in his soldiers and 
police. The message is stop the "unnecessary force" -- a euphemism forthe 
deplorable beatings -- or face aggressive action by the American troops. Good 
move.

 ARISTIDE WATCH: Perry also met with ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
who, after a few days of mostly glaring silence, finally, if not exactly 
gushingly, thanked the United States for its intervention. Aristide also called 
on all Haitians to reject violence. That won't happen without the presence of a 
strong multinational peacekeeping force and a vigilant U.S. press. And it won't 
happen without a consistent U.S. policy message: It's a new ball game, watch 
your step.

CULTURE, BEHAVIOR: WE ARE WHAT WE WATCH; JUNK MEDIA: WE CONTROL PRODUCTS THAT 
INJURE OUR BODIES, BUT WHAT OF THOSE THAT CONTAMINATE OUR MINDS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONELLA H. MEADOWS, Donella H. Meadows is an adjunct professor of 
environmental studies at Dartmouth College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New reports come out every month or so about the decline of the American mind. 
Every study shows a direct correlation between poor intellectual performance 
and frequent television watching. No surprise. There are roughly as many 
studies showing that television rots the mind as there are studies showing that 
junk food rots the body or that cigarette smoking rots the lungs -- as if we 
needed studies. 
</P>
<P>
 As a society, we're doing more and more to deglamorize and control tobacco 
products. Enough of us are intent on healthy diets that even the junk-makers 
are cutting back (a little) on fat, sugar, salt and chemicals. But so far, 
we're doing no more than gripe about inane ads, violent movies, obscene songs, 
vitriolic talk-shows, stupid sitcoms, though they degrade our minds, our 
families and our nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't our children write? Have you ever looked at the script of a TV show, 
even a news show, even a sober PBS documentary? There is no logical flow. The 
words are there as commentary on the pictures. The pictures are chosen not to 
build up a sequence of thought, but to engage the emotions. Sustained 
intelligence is hard enough in a visual medium even if that were the intent of 
the producers, which it rarely is. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do families fall apart? We spend more time with the smart-talking families 
on TV than with the real ones next door or even in our own house. Media 
families are not known for their patience, compassion, productivity or 
thinking. How often do you see sitcom characters working with a sense of 
commitment? Or reacting to an idea with anything other than a wisecrack? How 
often do you catch them in an act of civic responsibility? 
</P>
<P>
 Why are our politics venal and divisive? On talk shows everything is black and 
white, our side and their side. Facts are twisted to ridicule one side and make 
the other look good. How can a child listening to steady streams of distortion 
learn to be open to ideas and to test them for truth?  
</P>
<P>
 Why does our nation lead the world in materialism, irresponsible sex and 
violence? Hundreds of times a day, the ads tell us how to solve every problem 
by buying something. Between the ads, the shows have one purpose -- to hold our 
attention until the next ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Poisoning by media is even more harmful than poisoning by cigarettes or 
saturated fats, because it destroys not just individuals, but culture. Culture 
is shared consciousness, the common experience, the small things we all know, 
the characters in our stories, the morals those stories carry. Culture is what 
we absorb as we grow up, what we see and hear so often that we call it reality. 
Out of culture comes behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Our culture used to be derived from experience with land, tools, materials, 
family, neighbors, nature. Now it is invented in the fantasy shops of New York 
and California by people who only want to keep us dazzled and watching. 
Visitors from abroad are shocked by the brutality, stupidity and artificiality 
of what we let these people broadcast into our heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose we decide to do something about this cultural assault. At first 
glance, it isn't clear what to do, since our blasted minds have lost the 
distinction between free political speech, which is essential to democracy, and 
free commercial speech, which can undermine democracy along with everything 
else worthwhile. If we keep the two straight, we can come up with as many ways 
to restore our culture as ways to protect our lungs. We can start with the 
disposition of our multibillion-dollar gift of the public airways to private 
profit-makers.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, there's the "off" switch. It's hard to turn, I know, because, 
like tobacco and junk food, junk culture is addictive. It fills us with 
illusion to the point where we don't know how to lead real lives. It sedates 
our kids so we don't have to spend time with them. But, as with other 
addictions, the price of that cheap comfort is way too high. 
</P>
<P>
 The government could help us stay clean, by keeping pushers off the streets 
and out of our living rooms. But ultimately, it's up to us to decide what goes 
into our own and our children's lungs, mouths, eyes, ears and minds.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: FEED A VAGRANT, GO TO JAIL IN SAN FRANCISCO; 
THE CITY BY THE BAY IS ALMOST MEDIEVAL IN ITS TREATMENT OF THE HOMELESS AS 
INHUMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications.

<TEXT>
<P>
 This week, Keith McHenry is sitting by the phone waiting for a call to come 
down to Superior Court in San Francisco to face a felony charge arising from 
his efforts to feed the city's homeless. San Francisco has piled other felony 
charges on him. So this Good Samaritan faces a possible life sentence under 
California's three-strikes-and-you're-out law.  
</P>
<P>
 For feeding homeless people in San Francisco, McHenry has been arrested 92 
times since 1988, though never tried and never convicted. Right now, the U.N. 
Commission on Human Rights in Geneva has his treatment under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Anywhere from 6,000 to 15,000 people in San Francisco are in shelters or 
flophouse hotels or making do in alleys and parks. The homeless, the 
panhandlers and kindred sidewalk sentries are disturbing to many folks, most of 
all the downtown businesses who want them off Union Square, Civic Center and 
the parks. Let 'em go someplace else, like Oakland.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, as in many other cities across the country, the homeless are a mixed 
bunch, very much the same as the homeless in another tough era for poor folk, 
described by Sir Thomas More in his "Utopia," published in 1516. Discussing 
vagrants in 16th-Century England, More talked of people looking for work but 
not finding it, vets ("those who often come home crippled from foreign or civil 
wars") and assorted victims of the profit motive. In More's time, it was the 
enclosures. Today, it's jobs heading south.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, as now, homeless included the insane, either left to wander the streets 
or, at the discretion of arresting officers, dropped off at the hospital or the 
jail.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Frank Jordan's Matrix program, launched in 1993, saw the San Francisco 
homeless hassled viciously, their bundles of belongings and carts tossed into 
garbage trucks. Harassment extended to McHenry and his fellow members -- among 
whom are homeless people -- of Food Not Bombs. Their crime has been to feed the 
homeless and to assert that homeless people are full citizens with full 
citizens' rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Out of 720 arrests and an expenditure by the city of $5 million on homeless 
hassling, only one Food Not Bombs volunteer, Robert Norse Kahn, has gone to 
trial, handed 60 days (being appealed) for giving a woman a bagel in one of the 
city parks. On May 10, McHenry was charged with felony possession of a milk 
crate while staffing a literature table.  
</P>
<P>
 The charge for which McHenry awaits imminent trial stems from an incident on 
May 13, when he and a 71-year old male companion entered the office of 
Supervisor Barbara Kaufman in City Hall to distribute literature about their 
organization.  
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Kitz, an aide to Kaufman, demanded that they get out. McHenry recalls 
that he proffered a leaflet, saying, "Here, you might as well take one." The 
aide slammed the door and McHenry says he put out his hand to stop it from 
hitting his friend. The glass hit his hand and severed an artery. Claiming 
McHenry had punched out the glass, police arrested him and charged him with 
felony assault.  
</P>
<P>
 In "Utopia," More wrote that "it would have been much better to provide some 
means of getting a living, that no one should be under this terrible necessity 
first of stealing and then of dying for it."  
</P>
<P>
 Now, as then, there aren't enough jobs, and many cities and states are 
deciding that the way to deal with the sort of social collapse represented by a 
homeless person is to criminalize poverty. Close down public assistance, close 
your eyes and hope that the homeless, the single mothers, the down and out will 
disappear.  
</P>
<P>
 Across New York City there are thousands of abandoned buildings taken over by 
the city that homeless people rehab and move into. The city sells the sites to 
speculators, who have the police kick out the homesteaders, then raze the 
structures. So much for allowing the helpless to help themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure, a persistent panhandler or a scrofulous vagrant can be tiresome, even 
frightening. But so long as the prevailing social attitude is to answer all 
problems with prisons, there will be more panhandlers and more vagrants.  
</P>
<P>
 The historian Gaston Roupnel reports that citizens of 17th-Century Dijon, in 
France, were forbidden to feed the poor: "In the 16th Century, the beggar or 
vagrant was fed and cared for before he was sent away. In the early 17th 
Century, he had his head shaved. Later on, he was whipped; and the end of the 
century saw the last word in repression -- he was turned into a convict."  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this kind of progress occurs more quickly now than it did three 
centuries ago.

TV REVIEWS; NBC'S STRONGEST EVENING OF THE WEEK HAS ITS WEAK SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a single evening, NBC goes from one extreme to the other. NBC has flat-out 
the best comedy series of the new season in "Friends" and flat-out one of the 
worst in "Madman of the People." Each premieres tonight in a lineup that, 
despite "Madman," promises to be the network's strongest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, NBC's "Martin Short Show," whose second episode aired Tuesday, is 
flat-out flat, as well as baffling and disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 The sexy, urbane "Friends" -- from Marta Kauffman, David Crane and Kevin 
Bright, the people responsible for the HBO super-comedy "Dream On" -- starts 
fairly strongly tonight, improves next Thursday and in week three gets on a 
grand, hilarious, rip-roaring roll. It's the perfect series to bridge "Mad 
About You" and "Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 Its premiere has the burden of sorting out the major characters in this 
communal comedy, six singles in the their 20s who spend much of their time 
slouching around -- in their spacious pad and in the casual cafe/coffee house 
where some of them work -- talking about being single. It sounds vacuous, and 
it is, sort of, but wittily vacuous, with crisply written dialogue adroitly 
executed by the show's strong ensemble cast: Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, 
Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow and Matt LeBlanc. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can hardly stop smiling," one roomie says. "I can see that," another 
responds. "It looks like you slept with a hanger in your mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a hub character here, it is Cox's Monica, an assistant chef whose 
passive brother (Schwimmer) moves in with the group after his wife leaves him 
for a woman. All of the characters are likable and funny, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that the cafe and apartment look somewhat alike -- and that the 
schmoozing and blizzard of acerbic one-liners occur in both places -- 
juxtaposing these locales gets confusing. And the notion that all of these 
attractive people would remain platonic while flopping around together is a bit 
far-fetched. Yet these are nit-picks, and "Friends" has so many good moves that 
there's really nothing to dislike. It's all so light and frothy that after each 
episode you may be hard-pressed to recall precisely what went on, except that 
you laughed a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 And look, no hanger. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Madman of the People" is something you'd like to mothball and hang in a vault 
indefinitely. It has a great time slot following the enormous hit "Seinfeld," 
but little wit or intelligence with which to fill it. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it's one of the fall season's least likable new comedies, squandering 
Dabney Coleman in a near humorless half hour about an abrasive hotshot magazine 
columnist who finds himself working for his daughter when she becomes 
publisher. He doesn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman has made a living being snide and insulting for laughs. A master at 
it, he has played obnoxious TV characters before, but usually in comedies 
("Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," "Buffalo Bill" and "The 'Slap' Maxwell Story") 
that had the redeeming virtue of being funny. Here, as star columnist Jack 
Buckner -- who lives for ticking people off in print and in person -- he is 
obnoxious minus any of the good stuff, a cynical iconoclast whose caustic digs 
are nasty without being comical or even clever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madman of the People" is black comedy sans the comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Right away tonight, Jack clashes with his daughter, Meg (Cynthia Gibb), over 
matters ranging from trivial to serious, including her decision to oust one of 
his best friends, the magazine's inept music critic. The dismissal scene 
irritatingly careens over the top before weakly concluding with a stab at gooey 
sentiment.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's a tossup which is the more grating locale: the magazine office 
or the Buckner home, which Jack shares with his inhumanly patient wife, Delia 
(Concetta Tomei), and their 24-year-old ne'er-do-well son, Dylan (John Ales). A 
second daughter and her schnook of a husband also surface tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Things get worse. As bad as the premiere is, it is absolutely brilliant 
compared to the second episode, which finds Jack accused by his family and 
angry neighbors of killing a robin whose chirping kept him awake at night. A 
withering cross-fire of dead animal and cheap sex jokes ensues, leading to 
another maudlin finale -- prompting you to conclude that euthanasia would be 
best for the entire series. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can make this work," Meg assures her father. Unlikely. With "Seinfeld" as 
a brawny lead-in, "Madman of the People" may thrive in the ratings, but if 
episodes 1 and 2 are representative, it will never work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that worked in last Thursday's debut of "The Martin Short Show" 
was a "Dave" parody starring Short's marvelous mega-nerd character, pointy 
haired Ed Grimley. Unfortunately, the rest of the show might have been written 
by Grimley, I must say. 
</P>
<P>
 The second episode on Tuesday -- with Steve Martin playing himself, but as an 
egomaniacal sex addict -- was better, yet still less than you'd expect from a 
half hour deploying Martin and Short, two of the best physical comics in the 
universe, on the same stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Short in this epic talent pool are regulars Jan Hooks and Short's 
fellow "SCTV" alumnus, Andrea Martin. In fact, Tuesday's episode was a sort of 
"SCTV" reunion, initially featuring a moderately funny reprise of an old "SCTV" 
quiz show spoof, "Half-Wits." Former "SCTV" star Eugene Levy repeated his 
quiz-master role while also directing the episode. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure of "The Martin Short Show" is disorienting, even messy. Short 
plays himself as the star of a TV show, even using real-life anecdotes to 
create the impression that the NBC series is autobiographical. Yet Hooks, who 
isn't Short's wife, plays his wife, a fictional actress whose professional name 
is Meg Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 This show-within-a-show format has its roots in the comedy of Jack Benny, 
Burns and Allen and, more recently, "It's Garry Shandling's Show" on Showtime 
and Shandling's phenomenal current series, "The Larry Sanders Show" on HBO. The 
difference is that "The Martin Short Show," which Short executive produces 
himself, does it ineptly. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much performing talent, and a production staff whose credits include 
"SCTV," "The Larry Sanders Show" and "The Simpsons," Short's series should be 
much funnier than it is. Wall-to-wall Ed Grimley would be a welcome 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Friends" premieres at 8:30 and "Madman of the People" at 9:30 tonight on 
NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39). "The Martin Short Show" airs Tuesdays at 8:30 on 
NBC.

THEATER REVIEW; THE GROUNDLINGS: STILL CRAZY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Happy birthday, Groundlings. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this week, the 
comedy/improv troupe that spawned Laraine Newman, Jon Lovitz and Paul "Pee-wee" 
Reubens, among many others, showed off its history with a raucous celebration 
featuring some of its illustrious alums. While Monday -- the evening that was 
devoted to the 1970s -- was more of a nostalgia trip than real comedy, it 
managed to be funny just by osmosis. In fact, several people in the back of the 
theater were laughing so hard that it sounded as if they needed medical 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the '80s celebration, was funny by anyone's standards. In one improv, 
audience members were asked to supply the occupation of a woman, to whom Phil 
Hartman would then perform a rock love song. Someone yelled out "dog clipper" 
(we trust this was not a plant). Amazingly, Hartman came up with a lyric that 
rhymed "Doberman pinscher" with "10-incher." That might have taken Stephen 
Sondheim several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the written routines, two were close to brilliant. One featured an 
automated Abraham Lincoln (Jim Jackman) from the Hall of Presidents speaking 
about the Constitution. When his technology goes haywire, Jackson goes into a 
hilarious, sputtering dance that's choreographed with the exactitude and weird 
modernism of Robert Wilson, with a touch of Michael Jackson (at one point, 
President Lincoln grabs his crotch). 
</P>
<P>
 The second routine, "Barflies," starred Melanie Graham, Deanna Oliver and 
Deryl Carroll as three of the sorriest drunks this side of Charles Bukowski. 
This skit, too, went far beyond comedy into some exhilarating, heightened 
reality where stock characters overflowed with unexpected humanity.  
</P>
<P>
 Graham was also terrific as a white trash litigant on "People's Court" and as 
one of the always dependable waitresses at Dupars, who flies to the rescue of 
diners at the mercy of trendy Melrose Avenue waiters more concerned with 
Madonna gossip than service. 
</P>
<P>
 William Schreiner directed the '80s evening, and Gary Austin, the company's 
original artistic director, showed up to commandeer the '70s alums. Perhaps in 
a tribute to that decade, Austin looks as if he has preserved his hairstyle 
with meticulous accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 While the improv under Austin's direction never took flight, some of the 
routines were funny. Phyllis Katz was fascinating as a parakeet trapped in a 
woman's body, and Lynne Stewart figured out that a killer imitation of Leslie 
Caron in "Gigi" comes off even better if it's delivered by a second-rate, 
Middle Eastern belly dancer who can barely speak English. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one to let a good idea go fallow, the next night Stewart played a Mexican 
entertainer who did a phenomenal Judy Garland. Most of the abundant show-biz 
jokes worked, with the exception of Sandy Helberg's hostile telethon host, 
Jackie Muldavin. The character's Jerry Lewis-like combination of self-pity and 
rage would have been interesting if he hadn't enlisted audience members and 
then mercilessly insulted them.  
</P>
<P>
 Julia Sweeney performed "Pat," the one-joke androgyny she made famous on 
"Saturday Night Live." She was charming as Mea (Culpa), a character so 
submissive she apologizes for surprising a robber. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Cathy Shambley had a lovely moment in "Too Much Time," as a woman 
whose date calls to say he will be late. Sitting before the mirror with an 
unexpected couple of minutes, she glances through a fashion mag and begins to 
make up her face to look like one of the pouty nymphs in an advertisement, 
transforming from an attractive woman to a horror. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience seemed familiar with these routines, but to this first-time 
visitor, many of them were a revelation. Are today's Groundlings carrying on 
this noble tradition? I couldn't say, but, if you're curious, the troupe's new 
show, "Good & Twenty," has its premiere on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Groundling Theatre, 7307 Melrose Ave., Hollywood. Tonight and Friday at 8 
p.m. $35. (213) 934-9700. Running time 2 1/2 hours.

ABT RETURNS WITH A DREARY 'MANON'; DANCE REVIEW: KENNETH MACMILLAN'S 
DRAMATICALLY SLOW WORK HAS ITS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PREMIERE AT ORANGE COUNTY 
PERFORMING ARTS CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Too bad it's not called "Lescaut." 
</P>
<P>
 With the dynamic Gil Boggs in the role of the predatory, stage-managing 
brother Lescaut, Kenneth MacMillan's "Manon" shifted its central focus. 
</P>
<P>
 As danced Tuesday by American Ballet Theatre at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, Boggs commanded attention whenever he was onstage, unexpectedly 
overshadowing the other characters danced by Cynthia Harvey and Guillaume 
Graffin. 
</P>
<P>
 At least for two acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Then MacMillan killed off Lescaut, and the focus rightfully returned to the 
other two. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California premiere of the New York company's first full-length 
version of "Manon" opened a six-day engagement at the Center that will also 
include a mixed-repertory program. Derived from the original Abbe Prevost 
18th-Century novel, MacMillan's "Manon" nevertheless follows the plot of 
Puccini's opera "Manon Lescaut" rather faithfully, more faithfully than 
Massenet's earlier opera "Manon." 
</P>
<P>
 But MacMillan opted for a pastiche Massenet score (orchestrated and arranged 
by Leighton Lucas and Hilda Gaunt), which incorporates nothing from the opera. 
Against Massenet's limpid salon music, however, the choreography too often 
looked overwrought. On the other hand, it would probably look overwrought no 
matter what the music. 
</P>
<P>
 MacMillan carried over some of the techniques he had used in the earlier story 
ballet, if not, as in the case of the fright-wigged prostitutes, some of the 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Much attention was given to create a sense of milieu, particularly unsubtle 
social, political and economic oppression. With lots of bits of busy-ness on 
the sidelines to illustrate heartless class struggle, MacMillan actually often 
looked preoccupied with trees at the expense of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Extraneous characters danced up a storm and ate up time in the slow-paced 
narrative. Sometimes the choreography was strikingly ungainly, as in the foot 
lift assists in the pas de trois of Manon, Lescaut and Monsieur G.M. In some of 
his most poignant moments -- the deported prostitutes arriving in Louisiana, 
for instance -- MacMillan undercut his own best interests: in this case with 
silly synchronized group head-rolls or having all the women fall down at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The four central pas de deux required much athleticism, which Harvey as Manon 
and Graffin as Des Grieux made look more like hurdles to be overcome than 
opportunities for emotional expression. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, until the final act, the rapport between Harvey and Graffin was 
hardly ideal. She was cool and elegant and more persuasive in moments dedicated 
to the high life than to the love she was supposed to show toward her lover. 
Graffin was noble in the character's protracted passive suffering, but somewhat 
troubled in technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Both fortunately came alive in the final scenes of murder, madness and death 
in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 In the thankless role of Lescaut's Mistress, Kathleen Moore managed to keep 
her dignity and technique intact, even in the parodistic duet with the drunken 
Lescaut, a prototype of the women-will-endure-anything-from-an-abusive-man duet 
that MacMillan raised to dubious heights in "Mayerling." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Owen made Monsieur G.M. a true sophisticate. Ethan Brown was a 
properly heartless Jailer, Lucette Katerndahl a giddy Madame. Robert Underwood, 
the Beggar Chief, offered some of the clearest, unsmudged turns in the air all 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The women of the corps managed the jejune prostitute dances well enough, 
despite the requisite hitching up of their dresses every four measures. The 
male corps showed similar strength as gallants and dandies. Someone should 
teach the soldiers how to march, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Georgiadis designed the oppressive orange rug-remnant scenery. Thomas 
R. Skelton lit the scenes warmly. Charles Barker conducted an alert Pacific 
Symphony with clarity and elegance, if with low-powered energy. 
</P>
<P>
 One wants to be a booster for the company during its current financial 
struggles. Quoted in an essay in the program booklet, ABT artistic director 
Kevin McKenzie thanks his dancers for giving up 10 weeks of work (only 10?) to 
help the company "contain costs." He says financial conditions would have been 
even worse without the bookings last year at the Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the company as a whole danced strongly and looked committed to the 
threadbare narrative. The opening night cast will appear with two other sets of 
principals in performances of "Manon" Friday through Sunday. A mixed bill is 
set today. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Ballet Theatre will dance works by James Kudelka, Twyla Tharp and 
Natalia Makarova (after Petipa) today at 8 p.m. at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. The company will dance 
MacMillan's "Manon" Friday through Sunday at 8 p.m. and on Saturday and Sunday 
at 2 p.m. Tickets, $18 to $55, through Ticketmaster, (714) 740-2000 or (213) 
480-3232, or at the Center, (714) 556-2787.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; FOGERTY SHOWS HIS CREEDENCE CREDENTIALS; A 90-MINUTE BENEFIT 
PERFORMANCE AT THE HOUSE OF BLUES INCLUDES MANY OF THE OLD SONGS, VITALLY 
RENDERED BY A TRUE ROCKER IN HIS FIRST FORMAL CONCERT IN EIGHT YEARS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of the "Emergency Blues" benefit concert on Tuesday at the House of 
Blues had fun placing estimated values on some of the items at their silent 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, the money's for charity, so why not declare as "priceless" an autographed 
Mickey Mantle baseball cap or signed Ringo Starr drum skins? Even if we're just 
talking three- or four-figure bids here. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Sting would have to chuckle if he saw his Tiffany key chain listed as 
priceless -- and a concert-goer did laugh out loud when he saw an autographed 
T-shirt from Traffic, the tour bomb of the year, in that category. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no denying, however, that the evening's music had a priceless 
quality: the first formal concert performance in eight years by John Fogerty, 
the former leader of Creedence Clearwater Revival and one of the greats of 
American rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Fogerty, who'll be 50 next year, has only made about half a dozen stage 
appearances since his 1986 solo tour, but they were short sets, no more than 
three or four songs -- as at the 1993 ceremony in which Creedence was inducted  
</P>
<P>
 into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Fogerty and a three-piece band spent almost 90 minutes on stage 
Tuesday. Most of the time was devoted to Creedence-era songs, many of which he 
hadn't played since the group broke up in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking eager and trim in black shirt and jeans, Fogerty opened with a tip of 
the hat to Creedence's early days and roots by playing "Suzie Q" and "I Put a 
Spell on You" -- '50s rock hits that Creedence reprised on its 1968 debut 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Fogerty's songs that established Creedence as one of the premier 
groups in rock history -- songs, from "Bad Moon Rising" and "Fortunate Son" to 
"Green River" and "Who'll Stop the Rain," that combined sometimes biting social 
observation with the energy and economy of '50s rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching Fogerty play guitar and sing with such authority Tuesday, it was hard 
to believe that he has been away from the rock arena for even a few weeks. Rock 
'n' roll seems to run through the man's veins -- 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 And the vitality of the music was mirrored in the celebration of the evening 
itself. In the spirit of that great American philosopher of the moment James 
Carville, it's the music, stupid.  
</P>
<P>
 True enough: It's the quality of the songs, fundamentally, that stands as the 
measure of most artists. Our appreciation of those songs, however, can be 
enhanced or lessened by the actions of the performer or the setting in which we 
hear them. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing sounds more hollow than social protest by someone whose own behavior 
suggests compromise or corruption. At the same time, few factors highlight the 
liberating qualities of rock 'n' roll music as much as benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident at the Greek Theatre on Monday when Elton John began a 
four-night engagement that will raise an estimated $750,000 for the Elton John 
AIDS Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the songs John sang during the evening have been bigger hits 
for him, the most moving moment was John's version of "The Last Song," a tune 
he wrote in 1992 with lyricist Bernie Taupin about a father's coming to terms 
with a son who is dying of AIDS. At the end of the number, John bowed his head 
softly, as if in silent prayer -- a gentle punctuation mark that summarized the 
often lonely and heroic struggles surrounding AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Fogerty's spirited performance at the House of Blues mirrored the 
optimism and determination of the half-dozen women who organized the event. The 
show and auction raised more than $200,000 for Jamie Belmont, a Toluca Lake 
woman who underwent a recent bone marrow transplant, and Stop Cancer, a Los 
Angeles organization that awards research grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bruce Springsteen and Paul Rodgers came out to join Fogerty on the 
night's closing number, the emotional peak came earlier with a blistering 
version of "Fortunate Son." Fogerty wrote it during the Vietnam War as a 
working-class attack on the way politicians and the wealthy were often able to 
wave the flag while getting their own children excused from battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it stands equally as a testimony to the power of the individual to get 
things done, including, on this night, the kind of grass roots benefit efforts 
reflected in "Emergency Blues." In this humanitarian setting, the pricelessness 
of Fogerty's art was underscored all the more dramatically.

 Real Improvement: The first matchup between ABC's defending ratings champion 
"Home Improvement" and NBC's Emmy Award-winning "Frasier" was a decisive 
victory for Tim Allen & Co. National ratings figures showed Wednesday that 
"Home Improvement" not only was unhurt by its new time slot and competition 
Tuesday night, but its ratings were also 4% higher than its average last year. 
"Home Improvement" was seen in about 21.6 million homes, compared to 13.8 
million for "Frasier" -- which suffered a 17% drop in ratings over its average 
of a year ago. Still, NBC, which is trying to establish a solid presence on 
Tuesdays, said its ratings for the new prime-time lineup were 38% higher than 
last season's Tuesday night average. THE ARTS

 NEA Gets Reprieve: The proposed National Endowment for the Arts budget got a 
reprieve from its battles with the Senate Wednesday when a House-Senate 
conference committee agreed with a House proposal to cut the agency's 1995 
budget by less than 2%. The Senate, miffed at a controversy last spring over 
performance artist Ron Athey, had voted to slash the arts budget by 5%, 
targeting 40% cuts for visual arts, theater and presenting and commissioning 
programs. The conference committee threw out the targeted cuts, allowing the 
NEA to decide where to trim, pending congressional approval. Wednesday's 
proposal would reduce the NEA's $170.2-million budget by $2.4 million. The 
measure goes back to both chambers for a vote, possibly by the end of the week.

 Controversy on Video: Meanwhile, the above-mentioned Athey's "Four Scenes in a 
Harsh Life," the controversial program that provoked the NEA backlash, has been 
released on home video by its distributor. The hourlong performance, which 
includes various onstage rites of body modification -- including piercing and 
bloodletting -- is available for $69.95 by calling 1-800-REEL-GAY. Writers 
Showcased: Three Los Angeles artists are among 10 writers nationwide selected 
by cable's HBO to be showcased next month in the HBO New Writers Project 
Festival. The festival, which takes place Oct. 12-30 at the Stella Adler 
Theatre in Hollywood, features four programs of one-act plays, selected from 
more than 2,700 submissions. Los Angeles-based participants are Heather Morgan 
("Dad, Cancer, Fear & Boys"), Nancy de Los Santos ("The Answer to My Prayer") 
and Maryanne Melloan ("The Blonde at the Party"). HBO launched the New Writers

 'List' Returning to Theaters: Although it's already out on video, Steven 
Spielberg's multi-Oscar-winning film "Schindler's List" will return Friday to 
55 U.S. and Canadian theaters, including Los Angeles' Fine Arts Theatre and 
Orange County's South Coast Town Center. The Holocaust-themed film also 
continues to be screened for high school students, with an estimated 1 million 
students having seen it so far as part of a free educational program. 
Meanwhile, "Schindler's List" will add to its honors when it receives the 
Studio Crystal Heart Award at the Oct. 27-31 Heartland Film Festival in 
Indianapolis; and in Beverly Hills on Oct. 1, Spielberg will receive the 1993 
Chaim Weizmann Award for Philanthropic Leadership from the American Committee

B.B. KING'S BLUES CLUB OPENS WITH A TOAST AND GOOD SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 B.B. King raised a glass Tuesday at the new Universal City nightclub and 
restaurant bearing has name and toasted the invited audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this can be the beginning of a very, very long friendship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The beginning ? 
</P>
<P>
 For blues fans, the love affair with King has been going on ever since he 
started making records nearly 45 years ago. He's perhaps the most influential 
electric guitarist in blues history and certainly one of the most revered blues 
figures, period. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's hoping that B.B. King's Blues Club -- sister to a club that opened in 
his hometown of Memphis two years ago -- will showcase the blues as a vital and 
fresh art form. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's half as vital and fresh as King's performance Tuesday -- which was 
followed by a later, open-to-the-public show -- the club will achieve his goal. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrating both the opening of the facility, located on the second floor of 
CityWalk, and his recent 69th birthday, King and his eight-piece band were 
remarkably vigorous and inspired, covering all bases of modern blues and 
concluding with a spirited version of "The Thrill Is Gone," his 1970 pop hit 
and signature song. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the show, while greeting such well-wishers as Ike Turner and Gladys 
Knight on the patio, King said that the venue was inspiring -- and not just 
because he gets a percentage of the take for lending it his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we could have had clubs like this when I was just coming up," he said. 
"It has that old feeling, and we're hoping we can keep that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 B.B. King's Blues Club does have as much of the feeling of an intimate 
Southern club as you could reasonably expect to find in CityWalk's prefab urban 
environment. The design -- three levels with no spot much farther than 30 feet 
from the stage -- gives as much intimacy as is possible for a 500-capacity 
club.  
</P>
<P>
 The decor, too, gives an old Southern feeling, with many features -- including 
pounded metal ceilings and a copper Greek revival entrance -- coming from old 
Southern homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, much of the talk in the crowd was about the difference between 
King's and the other new L.A. club trying to create a similar environment: the 
House of Blues. The consensus was that B.B. King's seems more natural and 
cozier than the House of Blues (which is twice as large) and has less of a 
"Hollywood" feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 One difference is that B.B. King's will be "strictly blues and R&B," said 
Tommy Peters, the club's managing partner, in contrast to the House of Blues' 
eclectic booking policy. National touring acts will be booked on Fridays and 
Saturdays. (Upcoming shows include the Chris Cain Band on Friday and Saturday, 
Maria Muldaur on Sept. 30 and blues guitarist Phillip Walker on Oct. 1.) 
</P>
<P>
 A house band will perform Monday through Thursday, while Sundays will 
alternate between a Detroit night with a band featuring members of Was (Not 
Was) and a New Orleans set including former members of the Meters. Sundays will 
also feature a gospel brunch. A smaller room, called Lucille's after King's 
famed guitar, is also being readied, with plans to host acoustic blues and 
related acts.

 Today's menu of local album releases includes Will Brady's one-man acoustic 
blues effort; "Homespun: A Collection of Fullerton Artists," a collaborative 
project involving five bands and three poets; and a recording of the blues-rock 
Rhythm Lords. Ratings range from * (poor) to **** (excellent). Three stars 
denote a solid recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 *** Various Artists 
</P>
<P>
 "Homespun: A Collection of Fullerton Artists" 
</P>
<P>
 Homespun Productions  
</P>
<P>
 Compilations are scattershot by nature, but this one, an attractively packaged 
showcase for five bands on the non-punk side of Fullerton's alternative scene, 
has a good ratio of hits to misses. 
</P>
<P>
 Born too late for the free-form, freak-flag-flying '60s, Plato's Stepchildren 
attempt to re-create the mood of a hippie coffeehouse or a late-'60s college 
radio station where the pot was a bit too plentiful. The instrumentalists, 
mainly on bongos and acoustic guitars, try to keep a sense of coherence, but 
it's undermined by singers who spend too much time letting out whoops and 
animal noises as if they were part of a kindergarten class exercise in 
unfettered self-expression. One suspects that the Incredible String Band might 
have sounded like this in its most precious and diffuse moments; one also 
suspects that the ISB had the good sense not to release anything it recorded at 
such moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe's Art, fronted jointly by Al Olefer and former Don't Mean Maybe member 
Jeff Fairbanks, takes in some familiar indie-rock territory with its three 
tracks. While the songs aren't stunning, the band rocks cleanly and with an 
edge. It throws in enough jarring shifts to remind everybody why Fairbanks' old 
band often was compared to the Minutemen, but it more than balances any arty 
inclinations with its solid grounding in such reliable sources as the Rolling 
Stones, the Meat Puppets and the Velvet Underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Trip the Spring goes two for three: "Felt" never finds a center for Kevin 
Dutton's theatrical declamations, but "Long Yellow Weeds" (urban pastoral, nice 
sense of innocence and wonder) and "Motel Limbo" (urban afflicted, believably 
tormented) make for good bookends. Some might find Dutton's earnest, stagy 
style a bit much (think of David Bowie and Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson, with a 
touch of the Celtic airy quality of the Incredible String Band's Robin 
Williamson thrown in), but his voice is distinctive, and when he has a good 
role he is effective. The band is very strong instrumentally, with a firm and 
flexible rhythm section and a bevy of artful touches from lead guitarist John 
Kraus. 
</P>
<P>
 Moonwash Symphony comes through with a beautiful, hymnal air, "Nightingale," 
that front man Shon Sullivan sings mostly in German. It's hard to believe a 
melody this lovely wasn't borrowed from the European folk-classical tradition, 
but if Sullivan came up with it himself, he's to be congratulated. "Try" rides 
a darkly tunneling, Joy Division-like bass line and finds its way to some 
catchy melodic hooks as it evokes a moment of romantic crisis. Gentle seduction 
through strong craftsmanship is the band's method, and it works. 
</P>
<P>
 Room to Roam, in contrast, is a boisterous, bash-it-out crew. But it also 
knows how to throw out a strong melodic hook. "Leap of Faith" and, especially, 
"Fall Again" have the combination of humability and roughed-up alarm that are 
the stuff of many a KROQ hit. The loose, hard-driving attack works well (but 
the drumming shouldn't be quite this sloppy). 
</P>
<P>
 Interspersed between band segments are readings by three poets. Michael Mollo 
and Tom Rush are outraged by the usual stuff that outrages anti-Establishment 
types, and they express said outrage in the usual way (Rush is a respectable 
performer of his apocalyptic vision, "In the Time of the Plague"). The one 
worth hearing more of is Mark Obermeyer, who oozes sarcasm but is sufficiently 
funny and inventive in his wordplay to get away with it. "Orientation," his 
ridicule-heaping response to therapeutic attempts to reverse the sexual 
orientation of gay men, scores its intended ironic points but is memorable 
mainly for the fun he has doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 Will Brady 
</P>
<P>
 "Next Door to the Blues" (cassette) 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of money, not talent, is the only problem with this solo-acoustic debut 
by Brady, a veteran singer-guitarist from Laguna Beach who formerly played rock 
with Honk and traditional blues in the Brady & Siegel duo. 
</P>
<P>
 He has drawn all but one of these 12 tracks from performances along his usual 
round of club and coffeehouse gigs. Brady plays an amplified acoustic guitar 
with lots of reverb effects to give it more bite -- probably a necessity in the 
pubs where solo performers have to contend with the chattiness of cafe society. 
On record, though, it means getting used to a guitar sound that has too much 
brittle snap in the treble strings and too much boom in the bass. 
</P>
<P>
 With that caveat, Brady has come up with a tasty collection. The song 
selection -- drawn mainly from good, traditional outside sources but avoiding 
the too-familiar -- is varied in style, mood and tempo. Brady delivers 
everything in a clear, nuanced voice that carries his own interpretation rather 
than trying to mimic his sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beatin' Like a Tom-Tom," an Ernie K. Doe song, is a sad-eyed little gem that 
Brady milks for innocent charm. A Mance Lipscomb rag-blues, "Good as I Been to 
You," finds Brady willing to spice rural blues with a touch of urban jazz. 
"Ha-Ha in the Day Time," a wry lament by Percy Mayfield, hits some crying notes 
a la John Hammond that capture the speaker's real sense of hurt. Brady plays it 
straight with unvarnished, if somewhat restrained, regret on his own 
composition, "There's Nothing I Can Do About It Now." 
</P>
<P>
 He excels with rhythmic, rocking guitar work and more traditional blues solo 
licks; some of his jazzy sorties are less effective as he breaks away from a 
song's rhythmic base and fails to make the lone guitar swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to vibrant live-in-studio recordings by such solo blues acts as Paul 
Geremia and Robert Lucas, Brady's album isn't next door to ideal; it's pretty 
far down the block. He deserves a shot at recording under optimal 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 (Available for $10 plus $2 shipping from Will Brady, P.O. Box 9065, South 
Laguna, CA 92677-9065)  
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 Rhythm Lords 
</P>
<P>
 "Happy Hour" 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Records  
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to find a distinctive niche in the well-mapped world of blues-rock; 
this band from Long Beach and Orange County hasn't found one yet. But with 
their first full-length album, the Rhythm Lords at least are carrying on a wide 
search for something to call their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Front man Dale Peterson offers original songs in a variety of styles, 
including a Stevie Ray Vaughan-like tense, swirling shuffle ("The Bell Has 
Tolled"), a Looziana swamp-fever workout ("Voodoo Queen") and a jumping, 
Chicago-blues instrumental showcase ("Happy Hour"). The Rhythm Lords also move 
in some unpredictable directions, covering dark, dire songs by Tom Waits ("Down 
Down Down") and Bob Dylan ("Everything Is Broken"). So far, though, the magic 
formula that would separate this group from the large pack of worthy aspiring 
roots bands hasn't turned up. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean that fans of bands such as the Paladins, the Fabulous 
Thunderbirds and the James Harman Band won't find things to enjoy on "Happy 
Hour." Peterson has a solid, husky blues voice, and his guitar playing is 
consistently nimble, emphatic and tasteful (there's none of the egotistical 
show-for-its-own-sake that bogs down less worthy contenders). 
</P>
<P>
 In his best original, "Pay His Way," Peterson brings a laconic gallows humor 
to bear as he captures the sense of frustration and vulnerability pervading 
neighborhoods where street crime is out of control. Band member Eric Von 
Herzen, who has been heard on several of Social Distortion's bluesier tracks, 
gives the Rhythm Lords a second able soloist, and the rhythm section plays with 
a snap that lives up to the band's name. Good production abets the crisp 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the missing key that would turn all this ability and integrity into 
something special? It's inspiration, something nobody can pinpoint or describe 
until it suddenly appears. Sometimes it arrives when bands honor their calling 
and keep plugging away long enough to stumble upon it. 
</P>
<P>
 (Available from Rebecca Records, P.O. Box 3301, Long Beach, CA 90803, (310) 
987-1050). * The Rhythm Lords will open the Orange County Blues Festival Oct. 1 
at 11 a.m. at Doheny State Beach in Dana Point.

DANCE REVIEW; SMUIN BALLETS: POPULAR IS AS POPULAR DOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you put the words ballet and popular songs together, the question is 
usually whether or not dance can enhance a work that already has us happily 
singing along with it. 
</P>
<P>
 What sort of pirouette, for instance, adds to the already overwhelming romance 
of "Unchained Melody" Or, during "Heartbreak Hotel," will a classically trained 
dancer's princely posture interfere with memories of the King's perfect, 
pretzel-like moves? 
</P>
<P>
 These and other mysteries were taken on by Smuin Ballets/SF on Tuesday, 
launching a weeklong engagement at the James A. Doolittle Theatre. Headed by 
veteran San Francisco-based choreographer Michael Smuin, the new company of 13 
superbly trained dancers presented "Dances With Songs," 24 short works, most of 
which are set to Top-40 hits or standards. 
</P>
<P>
 A former artistic director of San Francisco Ballet, Smuin has also 
choreographed for television, nightclubs and theater, experience reflected in 
his movement vocabulary -- ballet with liberal sprinklings of jazz, country and 
Western dancing and Broadway show strutting. What Smuin relies on most, 
however, is the beauty of balletic forms -- the uplifted languor of 
curvaceously drifting arms, the allure of elegantly unfolding legs in pointe 
shoes or high heels, the nifty ways you can move from arrow-straight arabesques 
into romantic clinches. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it was enough: In Pascale Leroy's seductive ballet barre to Nat King 
Cole's "Unforgettable." Or in the Gipsy Kings' "No Vivre," passionately 
performed by Tiffany Heft. The latter began in silhouette, as did several 
pieces, to show off well-made shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, these shapes were enhanced by Sara Linnie Slocum's smoky lighting 
and Sandra Woodall's costumes, which ranged from drifty angelic gowns to quirky 
cowgirl chic.  
</P>
<P>
 Taking on "Heartbreak Hotel," Andre Reyes showed what Elvis could have done if 
only he had attended the School of American Ballet (it's hard to know if this 
is a good thing). Ex-Kirov dancer Nikolai Kabaniaev dances the same solo for 
the rest of the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Duets were less successful, somehow remaining on the surface of passion, 
offering familiar versions of partnership. Some were cute (a vaudevillesque "On 
the Sunny Side of the Street," a "Straighten Up and Fly Right"); a few were 
pretty but failed to extend already powerful vocal and instrumental 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 An also-on-tape gospel choir, contagiously singing "Oh, Happy Day," for 
instance, was the accompaniment for a kind of three-ring circus finale.  
</P>
<P>
 It was exhilarating. And a little confusing. Smuin is out to please, and an 
evening of such eclectic fare is often pleasant. There are no surprises, no 
irony, no discovery. It's possible he's leaving that for another evening.

MAN HELD IN ROBBERIES OF MAR VISTA AREA HOMES; CRIME: AT LEAST 14 WESTSIDE 
BREAK-INS ARE TIED TO SUSPECTED ROBBER. POLICE SAY HE WAS APPREHENDED AFTER 
FLEEING FROM AN OFFICER, GLANCING BACK AND RUNNING INTO A TREE.

<P>
 Los Angeles police have arrested a man they believe is responsible for a spree 
of robberies since July in which a gunman broke into Westside homes, tied up 
the occupants and made off with their valuables -- often in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested the man last week as he was walking in a Mar Vista 
neighborhood that had been the scene of several robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Lt. Al Michelena of the Pacific Division said Willie Sims, 
35, of Los Angeles may have done many, if not all, of the 14 house robberies 
reported to police between July 31 and Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims was booked on five counts of armed robbery and violating his parole, 
stemming from a previous burglary conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 In all but one case, in which a victim was punched, the gunman did not hurt 
the occupants of the homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were almost ready to give the guy the nickname of 'Nice Guy.' But 
(instead) we caught him," Michelena said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His (method of operation) was pretty distinct. He'd tie his victims up with 
duct tape and would wear a ski mask and gardening gloves." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the robberies took place in Mar Vista, there had been similar 
incidents in West Los Angeles, the Wilshire area and Beverly Hills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigations into the cases are ongoing, with detectives in Beverly Hills 
and three Los Angeles Police divisions working to ascertain which of the 
robberies Sims may have been responsible for. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelena said police are seeking a second gunman that witnesses reported in 
some of the robberies. Police are also looking into the possibility that Sims 
committed other crimes, such as residential burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said it is not clear why certain houses were targeted. The robber would 
often break in, instead of entering through unlocked doors or windows, and 
appeared to be focusing on single-family homes in middle-class neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, the robber would bind victims with duct tape, cover their faces 
and take cash, jewelry, VCRs and television sets. Often the gunman made several 
trips, hauling the booty out to the victim's car and then stealing the vehicle, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The break in the case came Friday night after Los Angeles police increased 
patrols in the Mar Vista area. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Sgt. George Aitchison spotted Sims walking in the vicinity of 
Victoria and Coolidge avenues at about 8:30 p.m. Sims matched the description 
provided by witnesses -- right down to the white tennis shoes the robber 
reportedly wore, Michelena said. 
</P>
<P>
 After briefly speaking to Aitchison, Sims fled, and the officer pursued him, 
Michelena said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims looked back to see if he was being pursued and ran into a low-hanging 
tree limb, police said. The impact knocked Sims to the ground and rendered him 
briefly unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a classic movie, running into a tree and knocking himself out 
like that," Michelena said.

TOPICS / SHOW BUSINESS; CASTING THEIR TALENTS IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT WYNNE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 22, Kristen Trucksess was flying high. The young actress had just arrived 
from New Jersey and within weeks landed her first role on television. 
</P>
<P>
 At 30, she has fallen back to earth. The roles have become fewer and farther 
between. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel frustrated because I was the young newcomer, the 22-year-old blonde," 
says Trucksess, who waits tables at a Santa Monica restaurant. "Now, it's 
harder."  
</P>
<P>
 But Trucksess, who played Howard Hesseman's girlfriend on one episode of "Head 
of the Class," won't give up. Like a growing number of other actors who hope to 
transcend the world of bit parts, she appears in "showcases" -- talent shows in 
which actors rent theater space to strut their stuff in front of invited film 
and television talent scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The showcases, performed in theaters, high school auditoriums and comedy clubs 
throughout Los Angeles, feature groups of scenes, comedy skits and stand-up 
acts. Lately, they have been popping up faster than bootleg T-shirt salesmen on 
Venice Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen years ago, if you had an agent, that was enough," says David Giella, 
casting director for Reuben Cannon and Associates. "Not any more. Now there's 
hundreds of more agents and thousands more actors." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides using agents, struggling actors often try to draw the attention of 
talent scouts by appearing in local theater productions. The showcases are a 
more aggressive means of self-promotion. They are usually free, held one or two 
nights and are only attended by talent scouts and actors' friends. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Monday night, Trucksess and 19 other actors were marketing 
themselves at the Matrix Theater on Melrose Avenue. They performed a series of 
two-person scenes at a show produced by Marcy Kaplan and her assistant, Alison 
Gale. The actors paid $175 each for theater rental and other costs. As each VIP 
entered the theater, they were handed a package of resumes and head shots. 
After the show, they were feted with white wine and pate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan, a 30-year-old actress who has appeared on "Beverly Hills, 90210," 
charmed a dozen or so producers and agents into the venue. So far, showcases 
have served her well. After a performance several months ago, she was invited 
to audition as Adam Sandler's love interest in "Airheads," although she was not 
cast.  
</P>
<P>
 Monday night's guests included Tri-Star producer Rob Fried ("Rudy" and the 
upcoming "Only You") and Gabe Sachs, an executive producer of comedies and 
reality programs for Universal Television. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an impressive format because it's a way to showcase acting ability with 
writing that most viewers are familiar with," Fried says. The night opens with 
a black comedy featuring Benjamin King as a handsome hunk with a nervous 
streak. The loud applause for King and partner Jules Guevara washes over him 
like a soothing balm. Since graduating from UC Santa Barbara, King has suffered 
through audition hell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been six months and there's been rejection left and right," King says. 
He recently left his agent. Carey Eidel, 37, has enjoyed as much exposure as 
any actor on the program. Still, the man who played Richard Lewis' brother in 
the Fox sitcom "Daddy Dearest" (canceled after 13 episodes last year) is 
looking for one more break. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 15 years of pursuing a goal and getting on a series, the series ended 
and my career stopped," Eidel says. "What I wanted was to let people know who I 
am at this time. I want one person who I don't know to say, 'I like your work,' 
and I want to have one person invite me to an audition." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eidel was followed by Kaplan and partner Randall Slavin, who drew several 
chuckles and a couple of howls as a couple suffering through a first date. On 
Wednesday night, Sachs, the Universal Television executive producer, was among 
those at the Diamond Club on Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by comedian Laura Milligan, this showcase featured sketch comedy, 
musical satire and stand-up by actors playing cult members who interrupt the 
show to hawk a ridiculously expensive seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not making a dime," says Milligan, 31. "I'm just hoping to get something 
out of this and it will be worth it in the long run." In addition to the troupe 
of unknown actors, such stars as Bobcat Goldthwait also appear, hoping to 
polish new material. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is scheduled to run five more Wednesday nights. Milligan works the 
phones every day because she can't afford to advertise.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, director Ben Stiller caught the program. And Sachs was thrilled by 
the show: "I've paid $20 for a comedy show and I didn't laugh as much." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone takes a shine to showcases. Ron Sossi, artistic director at the 
Odyssey Theatre on Sepulveda, remains a skeptic. "I don't know how seriously 
casting directors take people who do these scenes," said Sossi, who advises 
actors to appear in local theater productions. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors remain unfazed. Trucksess has "thought of quitting the Hollywood 
aspect of my career, maybe going into theater, but I would never quit acting." 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday night's show, Trucksess' answering machine was blinking wildly. A 
manager and a screenwriter called. Would she have time to "take a meeting?" 
</P>
<P>
 You bet.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; REWARD RAISED TO $100,000 IN SLAYING OF BRINKS 
GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Brinks Inc. is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of a man wanted in the Sept. 6 slaying of one of its 
armed guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard, Dennie Plese, was shot in the back of the head at close range as he 
delivered bags of money to Manufacturers Bank at 9701 Wilshire Blvd.Beverly 
Hills police say the gunman ambushed Plese at about 8:40 a.m., before the bank 
had opened. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman escaped with an undisclosed sum. Plese, 61, died in the lobby of 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially the armored car company had offered $10,000 but raised the reward to 
$50,000 two days after the fatal robbery, and then to $100,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes at $10,000 (witnesses) are scared to come forward. At $50,000, they 
may be still a little too scared. But $100,000 -- they'll call us," said 
Domminck Deiro, a Brinks security officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are checking out several leads that have been telephoned to a 
hot line: (310) 288-2650. 
</P>
<P>
 A sketch of the gunman has been circulated. He is described as white or 
Latino, in his early to mid-30s, between 5 feet, 9 inches and 5 feet, 10 inches 
tall, with black hair and a mustache and a long, narrow face. He has a medium 
build and was wearing a dress shirt, tie and dark pants at the time of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Plese, of Valencia, was a 36-year veteran of the Brinks company. He spent most 
of his career as a messenger, in charge of walking the money from the armored 
car into financial institutions, Brinks officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the third Brinks employee killed on duty since 1976 in the Los Angeles 
vicinity, Deiro said. SUSAN STEINBERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTWOOD; DRIVER HELD AFTER CRASH KILLS 1, HURTS 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A speeding Jeep overturned on Sunset Boulevard early Tuesday, killing one 
passenger and injuring four others, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Paul Hadley, 23, of Westwood, was booked on suspicion of felony 
manslaughter and held on $35,000 bail, said Los Angeles Police Officer David 
Kennedy.Police said they suspect Hadley was intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 A 23-year-old man whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives 
died at UCLA Medical Center, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other men and a woman, all in their 20s, suffered injuries that were not 
believed to be life-threatening, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the Jeep, estimated to be traveling at more than 60 m.p.h. -- 
with the top and sides removed -- was westbound on Sunset Boulevard at Bellagio 
Road about 2:25 a.m. The driver apparently lost control of the vehicle and it 
overturned, tossing out five passengers, LAPD Sgt. Doug Laird said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hadley, who was uninjured, was the only one in the car wearing a seat belt and 
was not thrown from the vehicle, Laird said.

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; HARD TIMES ON THE POLO CIRCUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE , SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Domingo Questel crouches forward in the saddle, his horse's hoofs digging up 
divots in the plush, closely cropped grass. His left arm extended, he swings 
his mallet and, with one long, pendular swipe, sends a small white ball sailing 
to the far end of the field -- with a pack of uniformed equestrians in hot 
pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion is a tournament in Pacific Palisades, at the emerald-green polo 
field in Will Rogers State Park. Questel is riding this day with a team of 
corporate executives, doctors and lawyers, but he's not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a hired gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Like half a dozen other professional polo players who are regulars at Will 
Rogers, Questel makes his living tournament-to-tournament -- paid by 
well-heeled amateur teammates, called patrons, to bolster their competitive 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 The life of such pros, who number about 500 nationwide, belies polo's image as 
the sport of royalty, the rich and the famous. Most play without guaranteed 
contracts. They receive no medical insurance in a sport in which serious 
injuries abound. And their expenses, which include keeping a string of several 
ponies, are steep. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most polo pros make barely enough to get by. Only about 100 of the 
professionals who belong to the United States Polo Assn. earn enough to do 
nothing but play the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the lot of the average polo pro, the ones who aren't getting the top 
jobs and are below the elite level, to just make a living," says Edward 
Scanlon, treasurer of the polo association, the governing body of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a message Questel constantly hammers home to Manuel, his 10-year-old son. 
"I tell him every night to go to school and study hard to be someone, not to 
play polo," says the Moorpark resident, who also has two daughters. "It's too 
hard to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 The polo circuit isn't the first place one would expect complaints about hard 
economic times. Described as the sport of kings, polo is decidedly upscale, as 
the membership of the Will Rogers Polo Club attests. 
</P>
<P>
 The club counts among its members real estate developers and financiers, a 
television producer, a surgeon, a manager of rock 'n' roll bands, several 
corporate CEOs and a string of attorneys. Sonny Sassoon, Vidal's son, belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's definitely the Mercedes and BMW crowd, though Will Rogers Polo Club is 
less exclusive than most. At one of the club's recent tournaments, picnickers 
lined the field, many of them eating pink-boxed lunches and sipping wine. A 
number of women in the crowd wore sun dresses and straw hats, and men sported 
golf shirts and khakis. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is affluence here, but in a non-pretentious sort of way," says Westside 
resident John Greer, who was at Will Rogers with his wife, Carrie, to watch the 
match. "I would like to get involved in the sport if I had the wealth to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for most pros -- generally one or two of whom play on each four-member 
team -- polo is no windfall. Although pros with the best handicaps (see 
sidebar, Page 15) command large fees, the majority do not. Questel, clearly 
better than his amateur teammates but in the middle rank among pros, earns from 
$700 to $1,000 for a two-day weekend tournament at Will Rogers. That, players 
say, is the average range of pay for someone at his skill level. 
</P>
<P>
 The earnings vary depending on how often tournaments are held. Another factor 
is location. In Southern California, tournaments in Santa Barbara and Indio 
attract wealthier patrons, who pay more to have a pro on their teams. 
</P>
<P>
 And the lifestyle is not that of a high-flying professional athlete. Like many 
other pros, Questel, 39, hauls his own horse trailer with a pickup, traveling 
to polo tournaments across Southern California in trips that each last up to 
four or five days. From January until the end of April, he plays often in 
Indio, where there are roughly 17 fields and some of the biggest money that 
California polo has to offer. From May to July, he plays frequently in Santa 
Barbara. Then he competes at Will Rogers through October, when the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 On the road, there is no four-star hotel room to repair to at the end of the 
day; often it's a bargain motel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The costs can be daunting. The meter starts ticking with the price of a polo 
pony -- up to $12,000 or more. Players need at least two, and most have four or 
more so they can hop on a fresh mount between periods, called chukkers, in a 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping a horse -- which means paying for stable space, grooming, feeding, 
shoeing and veterinary service -- costs an average of $4,800 a year, pros say. 
Tack -- equestrian equipment such as saddles and bridles -- is another $1,000. 
The wooden mallets, which break frequently, run about $95 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the polo club memberships that pros must pay if their patrons 
do not pay for them. The Will Rogers Polo Club charges about $3,000 a year, or 
$250 a month -- inexpensive compared to some clubs, where membership can cost 
$18,000 or more a year. 
</P>
<P>
 For Questel and other polo pros, these expenses can become burdensome because 
there is no guarantee there will be enough tournament income to cover the 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is no patron, there may be no paycheck.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they call you, but sometimes you have to sit down and call them to 
find out if they want you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many polo pros try to develop other income sources. Questel, for instance, 
buys, trains and sells horses when he's not involved in tournaments. Mark 
Cruse, a 40-year-old pro from Thousand Oaks who belongs to the Will Rogers 
club, not only trades polo ponies, he also manages ranches and consults with 
people who want to build them. And he referees polo matches, which pay about 
$500 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sidelines become crucial in the event of injuries, a persistent hazard on 
the polo circuit. Separated shoulders, broken bones and sprains are common. 
Players, who race up and down the field on horses galloping at about 35 m.p.h., 
say they never walk off the field without a fresh bruise or cut. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent match at Will Rogers, one player's departure with a broken 
collarbone barely slowed play. Questel lost an eye to the sport in his first 
year of play, 1979, when a mallet struck him in the face. He now wears an eye 
patch. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you haven't been injured, you're not playing the game right," says C.D. 
LeBlanc, a 95-year-old former polo amateur who remembers the days when Will 
Rogers himself played Sunday afternoons on the field that bears his name. 
LeBlanc had his nose broken at least half a dozen times and says he crushed or 
shattered numerous other bones. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, the pros keep playing. For Questel, the reason is that since 
his childhood in the Dominican Republic, polo has been what he does best. For 
Bruce Gaither, a 34-year-old Will Rogers club member from Sun Valley, it's that 
he simply loves the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaither chose polo over law school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to go through life just trying to earn money," he says. 
"Sometimes I can't believe God lets me do this for a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaither is typical of most professional polo players -- a skilled rider who 
started out as a stable hand and eventually moved on to the polo field. In 
1983, he dropped out of college in Florida. With $11 and a dog, he moved into a 
tent, his job as a stable hand leaving him just enough money every week to buy 
apples, peanut butter and dog food. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he got his chance. He trained horses for a patron who, during polo 
matches, faked that he had groin injuries so he could put Gaither in as his 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, in addition to playing, he teaches polo in clubs throughout Southern 
California.  
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to make it as just a polo pro and I starved," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons and pros both acknowledge that many pros have a hard time on the polo 
circuit, but there is no serious effort on either side to change the situation. 
The pros do not appear eager to organize and the patrons seem unlikely to 
improve their pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Polo pros recognize that although they raise the level of competitiveness on 
the field, their services are easily replaced, even eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Polo is played by a lot of Republicans who are not friends of the unions by 
any stretch of the imagination," says Scanlon, who has sponsored professional 
players himself. "If Domingo all of a sudden costs you $18,000 (a year) instead 
of the $9,000 you're used to, you'll call a couple of friends and play with 
them instead." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing polo's visibility is the best way to make the game a lucrative 
sport for more of its professional players, Scanlon says. The key, he says, is 
attracting television coverage; the U.S. Polo Assn. is working on a plan to 
have the sport televised as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the International Polo Federation is negotiating with the 
International Olympic Committee to once again make polo an Olympic event. Polo 
players have not taken part in the Olympics since 1936. The International 
Olympic Committee is reluctant to put polo back, Scanlon says, because it 
considers equestrian events too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that matters to Gaither, who says he will continue to play polo 
professionally even if the money and exposure never improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty addicted to this polo thing," he says. "I just wish that I had 
started playing a lot earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Questel takes a dimmer view of life as a polo pro. "I don't recommend it," he 
says.

THE LONG AND SHORT OF THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Polo players must have superior riding skills, excellent eye-to-hand 
coordination and ponies that are fast, aggressive and able to stop and turn on 
a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some horses would rather do a turn like a 747," says Lloyd Segal, president 
of the Will Rogers Polo Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Polo is said to have been played in Persia as early as the 1st Century. It 
later caught on in Tibet, China and India, where it was picked up by British 
cavalry officers. The sport became popular in England and was introduced in the 
United States in the 1870s. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, pro and amateur players are ranked based on handicaps that ascend 
according to proficiency, from minus-2 to 10. Few players in the United States 
are rated above 6, and only 10 in the world have attained a ranking of 10, 
according to the U.S. Polo Assn. Many of the top players are from Argentina, 
where the sport is popular and some of the best polo ponies are bred.  
</P>
<P>
 Professionals with handicap ratings of 10, known as "10-goal players," can 
make half-a-million dollars practicing for and playing in the U.S. Polo Assn.'s 
Open Championship, the finals of which are being held Sunday in Long Island, 
N.Y.  
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California polo circuit, however, rarely attracts 10-goal 
players. Its stops include the field at Will Rogers, the Los Angeles Equestrian 
Center arena in Burbank, the Fairhills Riding Club arena in Topanga, as well as 
clubs in Santa Barbara and Indio.  
</P>
<P>
 A regulation-sized polo field is 300 yards by 160 yards. There are four 
players on a team and each has a specific position, either offense or defense. 
The object of the game is to score as many goals as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset of matches, the handicap ratings of each team's players are 
added up. The difference is awarded to the lower-rated side in the form of 
goals on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A match is divided into six 7 1/2-minute periods, called chukkers. Since the 
horses would be hard-pressed to play back-to-back chukkers, players have 
several of them on hand -- sometimes as many as six. 
</P>
<P>
 The play can be rough, with competitors hooking mallets and bumping each other 
with their ponies. The rules revolve around the concept of a right-of-way 
established by the path of the ball. Penalties result in a free shot by the 
opposing team; the more severe the penalty, the shorter the distance of the 
penalty shot. MARY MOORE

VENICE: PROPOSED CHANGES TO BOARDWALK SETUP DRAW CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to express my opposition to three potential changes to the Venice 
boardwalk area. 
</P>
<P>
 First, I oppose straightening the bike path along the sand. As a tourist and 
visitor to Venice, I enjoy the charm of the winding path around the grassy 
areas. Also, I predict that the path would be more dangerous if straightened as 
people would be more inclined to speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, I oppose restricting performers to specific nook areas. Half of the 
charm is walking down the strand and "bumping" into different acts and 
performers. Making specific performance areas would sterilize the area; Venice 
is so much fun because of its informal nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, I oppose an overall redesigned boardwalk with new brickwork, etc. I 
love visiting Venice because it is not a trendy, Yuppie attraction. There's 
already a Third Street Promenade -- the area doesn't need another one. I love 
to visit Venice because it is unique and has its own character. 
</P>
<P>
 As both a tourist and consumer I will be less inclined to visit Venice if the 
proposed changes occur. Sure, Venice merits upkeep, but don't give it an entire 
face-lift. I visit Venice because of its quirky nature and not because it is 
organized and attractive. Don't change Venice, please. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In any change-related situation, special interests and community activists 
show up. While tiny in number, they purport to speak for the entire community 
-- most members of which could care less. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of this occurred at the Venice Town Council meeting in June. The 
bulk of the meeting dealt with the plans for the Boardwalk. The Town Council 
had sent out a questionnaire regarding the expenditure of Proposition A funds 
for Ocean Front Walk. Of the 145 questionnaires that were sent out, 67 were 
returned. Only 20 people said they had participated in the Coastal Conservancy 
workshops regarding Ocean Front Walk. Also, only 20 people said they were 
familiar with the Pollard/King revitalization plan for the walk. And, only 22 
of the respondents said they fully approve of the plan, while an almost equal 
number said they approve of the plan in concept only and wanted modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 10 people at the meeting. Only four were on the board of directors 
and there are only 42 paid-up members of the organization. Yet, with this small 
number of people at the meeting, and an unimpressive number of questionnaire 
respondents in favor of the Pollard/King plan, Mark Ryavec, the director of the 
Venice Boardwalk Assn. and an outspoken proponent of the Pollard/King plan, 
tried to force an endorsement of the plan at the meeting. I brought up the 
question of whether or not there was a quorum to make such a policy decision. 
The chair of the meeting, to her credit, said it would be inappropriate to vote 
at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 What I find disturbing is that Mr. Ryavec, aware of the lack of representation 
at the meeting, tried very hard to push a vote for an endorsement. When I asked 
him why he wanted to do this, he remained silent. 
</P>
<P>
 So, who speaks for Venice? Mark Ryavec desperately wants people to think that 
he and the various organizations he works with do. But it just ain't so. 
</P>
<P>
 A close examination of the membership lists of the various organizations that 
Mr. Ryavec says support the Pollard/King plan, which Mr. Ryavec claims to have 
authored, reveals numerous duplicate names -- i.e., people in one organization 
who are also in other organizations. A neat way to orchestrate what appears, on 
the surface, to be a great amount of support. 
</P>
<P>
 The people opposing the plan have shown up in large numbers at public meetings 
and argued against the plan. Do they speak for Venice? I don't know. All I can 
say is that it is obvious that there are a lot of people opposed to the plan.  
</P>
<P>
 The point is that supporters of the Pollard/King plan should stop crying foul 
and admit that they represent the community no more than their opponents. Then, 
let the discussion continue without self-righteousness and with a bit more 
candor.

HOLLYWOOD: MIX-UP IN NAMING OF SQUARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the sponsor of the proposal to create Raymond Chandler Square in Hollywood, 
I wish to clarify a misperception implied by a recent letter ("Hollywood: 
Street Name Change Draws Fire," Matthew L. Lesniak, Sept. 4). 
</P>
<P>
 The letter complained about the spate of street name change proposals in 
Hollywood, in which a historic name may be pasted over with that of a more 
recent figure. In the same breath, the letter linked my just-adopted project to 
a wholly unrelated proposal in a different City Council district (to rename a 
one-block portion of Tamarind Avenue in honor of L. Ron Hubbard). 
</P>
<P>
 Your readers should know there is absolutely no connection between these two 
projects. In proposing that the intersection of Hollywood and Cahuenga 
boulevards be designated as Raymond Chandler Square, I determined to avoid any 
disruption caused by a street name change. Raymond Chandler Square is not a 
street name and not part of any official address (though I hope residents and 
visitors will come to use the name informally). 
</P>
<P>
 Consideration of Raymond Chandler Square underwent the same deliberative 
process employed in the designation of any historic or cultural site as a city 
monument. My argument to the Cultural Heritage Commission focused on Chandler's 
place in the city's literary pantheon, and on the fact that the location 
approximates that of Philip Marlowe's office -- the starting point for a series 
of legendary journeys through the troubled soul of Los Angeles. The commission 
unanimously approved the proposal at two separate meetings, as did the City 
Council's Arts, Health and Humanities Committee and ultimately the full 
council. Raymond Chandler Square is now Historic-Cultural Monument No. 597 of 
the City of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, the author of such novels as "The Big Sleep" and "The Long Goodbye," 
died in 1959, with all his books substantially set in Los Angeles. No one 
opposed honoring Chandler with his own square. To the contrary, city 
officialdom turned out to be packed with Chandler aficionados, as Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg and cultural affairs chief Al Nodal immediately embraced the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 By designating Hollywood and Cahuenga as Raymond Chandler Square, Los Angeles 
has in a small way acknowledged its debt to the writers who have struggled to 
depict this most complicated of cities. Rather than erase history, Raymond 
Chandler Square celebrates it.

CIVIC CENTER: FALLOUT OVER CAMPAIGN TACTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Mr. (Frank J.) Gruber's letter of Sunday, Sept. 4, in which I 
was criticized by name: I had hoped that the rhetoric regarding RAND's Civic 
Center Plan for Santa Monica would have abated after the June vote. Perhaps Mr. 
Gruber has not heard of being "magnanimous in victory." 
</P>
<P>
 The point of my July letter was to bring to the attention of your readers how 
modern elections are fought. First, limit your opposition's ability to reach 
the public. The City Council's decision to schedule this vote in June, as 
opposed to the petitioners' request for November, was not to move quickly with 
financing of a new police headquarters. Both sides supported the new 
headquarters. The council and RAND used this issue solely to win. What happened 
when they did? They postponed financing this vital public safety facility 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, reinforce the "public safety issue" and obscure the environmental and 
cost issues during the campaign. Even a cursory look at RAND's mailings prove 
this point. Outspend your opposition nearly 40 to 1, more than $20 per vote, 
and more than Mr. Gruber's favorite whipping boy, Sen. (Tom) Hayden, spent in 
his entire statewide gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the McCarty Beach Hotel issue, which was resolved in a November vote 
and in which both sides had sufficient time and money to reach most voters, 
only 35% of the voters participated this time. Only 21% approved. Not quite the 
mandate, but certainly a "landslide" to RAND patricians who believe that the 
only thing that is important is to "win." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of building heights still alludes Mr. Gruber (as does the fact that 
I withdrew from the consideration of SMRR's endorsement for City Council). 
There is no height limit that cannot be circumvented by setbacks and 
step-backs. 
</P>
<P>
 The important issue is shadows, both onto Ocean Avenue and the so-called park. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months before the June vote, I predicted its outcome within two percentage 
points. For what it's worth, let me make these additional predictions: 
</P>
<P>
 1. With a multiyear development agreement in hand, RAND will sell most, if not 
all, of its property, profiting handsomely from its campaign donations. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Some building heights (as measured by normal people) will exceed 80 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The County Courthouse will not expand in Santa Monica. Even so, traffic and 
air pollution in this area will worsen. 
</P>
<P>
 4. New park space will be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Santa Monica will not get a new Police and Public Safety Headquarters for 
at least four years. 
</P>
<P>
 6. The plan will cost taxpayers and recipients of vital city services far more 
than it will bring in additional tax revenue.

 WRIGHT MOVE 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Wright, a former standout basketball player at USC and Iowa, has been 
hired to coach the Santa Monica High girls' basketball team. He replaces Heidi 
Overseer, who became coach at Chadwick. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, a Santa Monica policeman, played at USC in 1984 and at Iowa from 
1985-1987. George Raveling, the USC basketball coach, was Wright's coach at 
Iowa for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite announcing that he had enlisted in the military, the 6-foot-6 Wright 
was selected by the Detroit Pistons in the NBA draft. He was a physical 
education instructor and assistant basketball coach at Navy for a year and then 
had two years of flight school training. 
</P>
<P>
 After fulfilling his military commitment, Wright played professional 
basketball for Louvain, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, 30, worked for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for two 
years and has worked for the Santa Monica Police Department for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited not only because I'm getting back into basketball, which I 
enjoy, but because I can work with young people on campus," Wright said. UNDER 
PENALTY 
</P>
<P>
 West Los Angeles and Valley colleges engaged in a penalty-filled Western State 
Conference South Division game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teams were penalized 26 times for 235 yards. Standout Oiler running 
back Michael Black was ejected late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley won, 27-8. SMASHING DEBUT 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Taylor made school history Saturday as the first African American to 
coach Santa Monica College in a football game and he won his debut in 
impressive fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corsairs had nine players score in a 65-19 victory over Rio Hondo. 
</P>
<P>
 Corsair quarterback Jorge Blanco threw for 211 yards and three touchdowns with 
no interceptions. Receiver Nakia Wheeler had touchdown receptions of 63 and 35 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Quincy Wimbush had touchdown runs of seven and four yards, Robert 
Hayes had a seven-yard scoring run and John Houston had a 14-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never expected to score 65 points," Taylor said. "It came as a complete 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really hit a good niche in the second half. In football, when you hit a 
couple long passes and the team is playing good defense, it's hard for 
opponents to play catch-up." 
</P>
<P>
 Can the Corsairs produce that same type of scoring power Saturday at Santa 
Barbara? 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the campus here is asking that question," Taylor said. "Santa Barbara 
had a bye and saw us play. I'm sure they will be ready for us and we'll be 
ready for them." TRASH TALKING 
</P>
<P>
 Venice co-coach Tony Chretin is impressed with San Pedro's play on the 
football field, but he is not a big fan of the Pirates' demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really play an intimidating physical style of football, which we like," 
Chretin said. "They don't back down from anyone. But we don't like the verbal 
aspect of their team. They try to verbally intimidate you by trash talking. We 
don't do any trash talking." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams meet Friday night at Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen someone score a touchdown with their mouth," Chretin said. 
"They're capable of scoring with their helmets and their shoulder pads the way 
the game is supposed to be played." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, Chretin was unimpressed with his team's play in a 24-6 win over 
Hollywood. Chretin said his team was uninspired. Demetrius Posey, who carried 
nine times for 41 yards, twisted his right ankle while running the sweep and is 
out indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior running back Ronnel Jamar will replace Posey, the Gondoliers' leading 
rusher, against San Pedro. CASHING IN 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax came back a winner from its Las Vegas trip, defeating Silverado, 27-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver Ivan Torres had touchdown receptions of 89 and six yards. Defensive 
back Tanquary Clark scored on a 65-yard punt return and running back Anthony 
Gillespie scored on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, Jermaine Walton and Lewis Torres each had two interceptions and 
Darrick Houston had one. The strangest turnover, however, came when Deneal 
Davis wrestled the ball away from a Silverado player and ran 15 yards. SEAN

 Take this job and punch it: When employees of the Chiat Day ad agency in 
Venice take a break, they can watch television, shoot pool or pound away on 
punching bags in the recreation room. "We thought this would say to everyone 
that we're all in this together," said spokeswoman Adelaide Horton. 
</P>
<P>
 To emphasize the point, the punching bags are decorated with caricatures of 
the agency's bosses.

 The spy who surfed in from the cold: During a recent fund-raising dinner, 
Pepperdine University President David Davenport quipped that the school is 
becoming internationally known. He was referring to a charge by a former KGB 
colonel that Pepperdine collected Russian defense industry secrets under cover 
of a U.S. government-funded program. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport added that the school has also gained renown in another area. The 
hero of "The Chamber," John Grisham's latest thriller, is a Pepperdine grad.

 William Wallace, the owner of the Los Angeles Star, sold the newspaper in 
1856, he wrote that he was getting out of town because "the flush times of the 
pueblo, the day of large . . . pocketbooks, are past."  
</P>
<P>
 L.A., he predicted, would be characterized by "picayunes, bad liquor, rags and 
universal dullness, when neither pistol shots nor dying groans" would have any 
effect and "when earthquakes would hardly turn men in their beds!" We think 
Wallace was way off base -- at least about the earthquakes.

 Always on thin ice: With the L.A. Kings' preseason beginning, it's time for 
Angelenos to receive a pep talk from Police Sgt. Joe Friday (Dan Aykroyd), who 
had this to say in the 1987 version of "Dragnet":  
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, this city isn't perfect. We need a smut-free life for all our citizens, 
cleaner streets, better schools, a good hockey team. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Kings won't have so many picayunes on the roster this year.

building back after the computer convention is over.

SCOTT HARRIS: BOYZ WILL BE BOYZ, DESPITE FLAP OVER ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 8:17 in the morning and you're on the air with the slimmer half of 2 Fat 
Mexicanz. "Yo, yo, yo! What's up?!?" 24-year-old Eric Vidal shouts into the 
mike. "Speedy, a.k.a. Funkmouth, is in the house. What you doin', Funkmouth?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm chillin'," replies Funkmouth. Also known as Speedy Mercado, he is the 
Baka Boyz' new sidekick. "Just hangin' with the man, Eric V!" 
</P>
<P>
 Or something like that. Unless you speak hip-hop, it's hard to keep up with 
the Baka Boyz, the "2 Fat Mexicanz" of billboard fame. Baka, incidentally, is 
pronounced BAKE-ah, a tribute to the Vidal brothers' hometown, Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, Eric's 21-year-old brother Nick, the more voluble and, at 247 
pounds, the more voluminous half of 2 Fat Mexicanz, was out tending to personal 
matters. But that isn't what Eric V tells his listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had to get his stomach pumped! He got a couple of burritos stuck in 
there!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You know what they say: Boyz will be boyz. Their fans expect nothing less. 
Although many people don't appreciate their sense of humor, the Baka Boyz are a 
phenomenon. Thanks to their irreverent house party style, KPWR, the 
Burbank-based station better known as Power 106, zoomed from No. 9 to No. 5 in 
the mornings in the L.A. market in the most recent quarterly Arbitron ratings. 
Their listeners are mostly young adults and teen-agers; surveys show their 
audience to be 63% Latino, 12% African American and the remaining 25% white, 
Asian and "other." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this must irritate people who've been offended by the Baka Boyz 
billboard campaign. Perhaps you've seen the ads that boldly feature the "2 Fat 
Mexicanz" slogan and the Vidal brothers posing in the buff. In one ad, Eric 
covers his derriere with a pepperoni pizza, while Nick shields himself with the 
box it came in. The biggest ruckus was caused by an ad that showed the brothers 
eating pizza while sitting on toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 To the charge of bad taste, Power 106 quickly pleaded no contest, replacing 
the toilet ads with one showing the Baka Boyz holding a surfboard. But station 
management and the Boyz resisted the allegation, made in dozens of letters and 
a protest outside their Burbank studio, that the ads promote negative 
stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, listen to the Baka Boyz, 2 Fat Mexicanz," wrote Al Reyes, executive 
director of the California Chicano News Media Assn. "And let's dredge up old 
movie and literary images of the fat, jolly and lazy Mexican." Other critics 
likened the Baka Boyz to such stereotypes as Stepin Fetchit and Jose Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
 Power 106 management couldn't have been surprised that some folks were shocked 
by an ad campaign designed to be shocking. On the other hand, the Baka Boyz had 
been using the "2 Fat Mexicanz" slogan for 18 months, long before they secured 
the plum morning assignment, and nobody said shame on you. Nor was there any 
protest that this 72,000-watt station employs a promotional spot in which the 
booming voice of an announcer describes the Baka Boyz as "72,000 pounds of fat 
Mexican power!" Nor was there concern that a nickname the brothers use for each 
other, "Fatback," is a play on a familiar slur . "A fatback is someone who can 
pinch fat on his back," Eric explains, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is that a billboard, unlike a radio frequency, can't be tuned 
out. It's up there, like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute exposed a generation gap. Michelle Mercer, the 27-year-old program 
director for Power 106, expressed surprise that so many critics seemed to read 
"fat" as implying laziness and stupidity. Activists talked about the harmful 
impacts on young Latinos, but some seemed so oblivious to youth culture that 
they thought the trendy spelling of "boyz" and "Mexicanz" implied illiteracy. 
Yo, professor! Ever hear of "Boyz N the Hood"? 
</P>
<P>
 For the Baka Boyz, it's a happy coincidence that "phat," pronounced "fat," is 
high praise, sort of like "cool." Mercer, in fact, wanted the billboards to say 
"2 Phat Mexicanz." The Vidal brothers knew better. Their style is 
self-deprecating, not hipper than thou. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But grown-ups will be grown-ups, so in a kind of compromise, the offending 
billboards soon will be altered to say "2 Fat Proud Mexicanz." After 
discussions with the Hispanic Media Coalition, a group that combats negative 
stereotypes, Power 106 agreed to the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't mean, however, that the Baka Boyz are planning any makeovers, 
because they know their success is rooted in something deeper than billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, they were teen-agers who hustled ads to buy air time for 
their own hip-hop show on a 35-watt station in Bakersfield. Lazy? Stupid? The 
terms that come to mind are ambitious, hard-working, bold, savvy. It's just 
that the Baka Boyz would rather give the credit to pizza and burritos.

 Dillard's Faces FTC Action: The store chain is violating federal law by making 
it unreasonably difficult for credit card holders to purge unauthorized 
charges, the government says. The Federal Trade Commission alleged that Little 
Rock, Ark.-based Dillard Department Stores Inc. employs illegal tactics to 
avoid paying the tab for charges its customers claim were made without their 
permission. Dillard's also has illegally reported negative information about 
the card holders to credit bureaus and has initiated unwarranted collection 
procedures against them, the FTC said. The commission is seeking an order 
requiring Dillard's to issue refunds or to credit the card holders' accounts 
where appropriate, and to instruct the credit bureaus to correct their records. 
Dillard's, which has more than 200 stores, had no immediate comment.

ARBY'S TO PAY $525 MILLION FOR LONG JOHN SILVER'S CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of Arby's roast beef restaurants said Wednesday it agreed to pay 
$525 million in cash for Long John Silver's Restaurants Inc., the nation's 
biggest chain specializing in fish and seafood. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal will create a restaurant company with a combined 4,200 stores 
generating more than $2.5 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposed addition of Long John Silver's nearly 1,450 locations to our 
existing system of 2,800 Arby's restaurants will propel us overnight to the top 
tier in the quick-service restaurant industry," said Nelson Peltz, chairman and 
chief executive of Triarc Companies Inc. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Triarc would become the sixth-largest U.S. fast-food company, according to 
Technomic Inc., a Chicago-based restaurant consulting firm. McDonald's Corp. 
heads the list at $14.2 billion in domestic systemwide sales in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the deal closes, Triarc plans to begin making menus from both chains 
available at the company-owned Arby's and Long John Silver's restaurants. 
Franchisees will be encouraged to do the same. Restaurants will display logos 
of both companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to appeal to consumers seeking variety as well as convenience. It 
may also give Triarc more leverage when negotiating for supplies, advertising 
space and prime real estate locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Triarc also believes Long John Silver's is a good partner for Arby's because 
the Lexington, Ky.-based seafood chain has a strong dinner menu while Arby's 
sandwiches appeal to lunchtime diners.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; INTEREST RATE FEARS PUSH DOW DOWN 17.49 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fears of higher interest rates pushed stocks sharply lower for the second 
consecutive session Wednesday as yields on Treasury securities shot higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials extended a 67-point loss suffered Tuesday and fell 
an additional 17.49 to 3,851.60. An unexpectedly sharp rise in the nation's 
trade deficit Tuesday had led analysts to fear that the Federal Reserve Board 
would soon raise short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fears were supported early Wednesday when Wayne Angell, former Federal 
Reserve governor and current chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Cos., said 
there was a 60% chance that the Fed would tighten policy at its Sept. 27 open 
market policy meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Angell's statement, plus an unexpectedly large increase in housing starts, 
moved the markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond hit 7.80%, its highest close since June 24, 1992. 
Short-term bills were hit too, with the discount rate on three-month bills up 
by 0.18 percentage point to 4.79%. The bill's yield to maturity jumped to 
4.91%.  
</P>
<P>
 "People are giving more credence to the fact that the Fed may move next week," 
said Joe LaVorgna, money market analyst at the UBS Securities unit of Union 
Bank of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund managers and stock pickers face flat returns this year, and "with worries 
about the Fed raising rates again, and so little confidence in the capability 
of the stock market to make new gains, the temptation is definitely there to 
try to lock in this quarter's profits," said Jim Solloway, research director at 
Argus Research.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a good degree of wanting to move fast, owing to a lack of confidence 
about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were also responding to weakness in the dollar, which ended lower 
against the Deutsche mark and marginally higher against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two big uncertainties," said Dick Hoey, chief economist at Dreyfus 
Corp. "Will the dollar plunge against the yen, and will the public willingness 
to buy stock funds evaporate? If either of those things happen, that will be 
very bearish for the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 12 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume totaled 351.84 million shares, up from 325.89 million on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes also lost ground. The NYSE's composite index fell 1.20 to 
254.71. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.90 to 461.46. The Nasdaq 
composite index fell 6.03 at 760.71. 
</P>
<P>
 At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 3.38 to 454.77. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields started out firmer, but they dipped after the government 
reported that housing starts rose 2.1% in August, boosted by a double-digit 
jump in apartment construction. The report suggested to analysts that the 
economy may be growing faster than expected, stirring fears of inflation. But 
the report also indicated that single-family construction, which represents 
about 80% of new housing construction, fell 2.7% in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year bond yield stood at 7.80% at the end of yesterday's session, up 
from 7.77% on Tuesday. With the long bond approaching 8.0%, bonds are becoming 
more attractive, said Bernadette Murphy, executive director at M. Kimelman & 
Co. "If investors can get an 8% return . . . without any risk, they will tend 
to go into a yield instrument rather than buy stocks." 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks attempted a recovery in late morning as bonds trimmed their losses, but 
then headed south again in early afternoon. The Dow Jones industrials were down 
48 points in mid-afternoon before a technical rally cut those losses by more 
than three-fifths near the end of the session. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Economically sensitive stocks were hit hard by the specter of higher 
interest rates. The Federal National Mortgage Assn. fell 1 3/8 to 80 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial stocks were hit hard, amid the perception that higher interest 
rates could derail the economic recovery. Caterpillar led the Dow industrials 
lower and fell 1 1/4 to 54 1/8. Auto and paper issues also fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail stocks fell after Prudential Securities downgraded Nordstrom stock to 
"hold" from "buy" and cut its estimate of the department store company's future 
profits, saying sales growth will be lower than expected. Nordstrom fell 2 
15/16 to 39 13/16 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital Equipment led the action on the NYSE and rose 1 1/8 to 29, extending 
Tuesday's gains after Cowen & Co. upgraded the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overseas stock markets were mixed, with the Tokyo and Frankfurt markets 
rising but London and Mexico City falling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Coffee rose to its highest price in more than two months amid concern that a 
lack of rain in Brazil is adding to crop damage caused by two frosts during 
June and July. Coffee for December delivery rose 3.35 cents to $2.3135 a pound 
on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Little to no rain has fallen in coffee growing regions of the country since a 
second frost stung coffee trees on July 10. No rain is expected until at least 
next Monday, and longer range forecasts call for hotter and drier weather than 
normal.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A PASSIONATE MIXTURE OF HISTORY, POLEMIC AND ROMANCE; 
CORELLI'S MANDOLIN BY LOUIS DE BERNIERES; PANTHEON $24, 437 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The brutal Nazi occupation of Greece in World War II had an ironic if bloody 
footnote. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be entirely outclassed by Hitler, Mussolini had wanted a place of his 
own to conquer. He tried Greece, but the Greeks beat his soldiers so badly that 
the initially reluctant Germans had to move in to help. The occupation was 
partitioned for awhile; in the Italian zones, as a rule, it operated less 
harshly. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mussolini was overthrown and Marshal Pietro Badoglio surrendered to the 
Allies, he instructed Italian troops not only to stop fighting but to prepare 
to resist the Germans. The Italian command in Greece hesitated; the Germans did 
not. They attacked their former allies, imprisoning and executing thousands of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the background for "Corelli's Mandolin," set on the Ionian island of 
Cephalonia where the Italians and Germans both maintained garrisons. Louis de 
Bernieres has produced an exuberant jumble of a novel: a mixture of history, 
polemic and romance, and written with a wit that is incandescent and overheated 
by turns. 
</P>
<P>
 Its three principal characters -- a redoubtable Greek doctor, his beautiful 
and even more redoubtable daughter, and a lyrically impulsive Italian captain 
who is billeted on them -- are larger than life. They also display a number of 
authorial stretch marks. 
</P>
<P>
 These are particularly bothersome at the start, when De Bernieres introduces 
us to his small Cephalonian community just before the war. There is a forced 
touch of Garcia Marquez's Macondo, an effort at comic fabulousness. There is 
the immensely fat and sodden village priest, Father Arsenios, and Velisarios, 
the village strongman who lifts donkeys and carries around a small cannon, 
which he fires off like a pistol, to impress. Part of its discharge impresses a 
young fisherman, Mandras, who comes to Dr. Iannis for treatment and falls in 
love with Pelagia, his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor, a free spirit and a humane but passionate Greek patriot, is 
initially portrayed with a degree of arch grandiloquence. He is at work on a 
history of Cephalonia but can't strike the proper heroic note; and each 
evening, relieving himself in the garden, "he nitrogenated the herbs in strict 
succession." 
</P>
<P>
 This incenses Pelagia; in turn, her goat chews on the doctor's manuscript. 
"Pelagia, your accursed ruminant has eaten everything I've written tonight," 
Iannis expostulates. The two are proud of each other -- the unconventional 
Iannis wants his daughter to become a doctor -- and when war comes, each 
becomes a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 War, in fact, floats "Corelli's Mandolin" off its whimsical dry dock. It 
provides rigors and tragedies that give the author scope to exercise his powers 
for horror, irony and sweet human comedy without seeming forced. The account of 
the Italian army's disastrous winter campaign in the northern mountains is told 
brilliantly through the wistful and outraged voice of Guercio, an Italian 
soldier whose hidden homosexuality and vocation for heroic sacrifice fuse 
radiantly at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Lodged in Dr. Iannis' house, the Italian captain, Corelli, manages to bridge 
after a stormy start the gap between invader and invaded. His pacific nature, 
his lyrical optimism and his astounding proficiency on the mandolin state a 
humane alternative to the barbarism of war. 
</P>
<P>
 His solution to the dehumanization of a communal military latrine is to 
organize the users into a choir. When a fanatical Nazi officer happens by, 
Corelli returns the "Heil Hitler" with a "Heil Puccini." The German will 
eventually be confronted -- tragically, it turns out -- with his own humanity; 
but the process begins when Corelli magnanimously inducts him into the choir. 
Because he has no voice, he is assigned the position of "dotted demisemiquaver 
rest." 
</P>
<P>
 The comic inventiveness -- the mandolin is well-chosen for its flowery 
ornamentation of sad songs -- is inseparable from the tragedy. De Bernieres may 
overdo the whimsy at times, but he is terribly convincing about the awfulness, 
whether it is the massacre of the Italian garrison by the Germans, Dr. Iannis' 
fearsome improvisations as he sews up the terribly injured Corelli without 
medical supplies (he uses four mandolin strings), or the wretched, starving 
state of Greek villages during and after the war. (When an American relief 
officer walks through a village with his one Greek word, "Hungry?" he fails to 
emphasize the question mark, and the starving peasants scrounge him up a 
banquet.) 
</P>
<P>
 De Bernieres has not only written an impassioned story; he has written it from 
an impassioned point of view. Mandras, Pelagia's former fisherman-fiance, 
becomes a communist guerrilla, commits all kinds of atrocities, shirks fighting 
the Germans, and returns, grossly fat, to attempt to rape her. It is, to say 
the least, a shorthand way of taking historical sides on a civil war in which 
there was plenty of horror to go around.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the forced beginning, and routine ending that hastily sums up 50 years 
of postwar Greece through Pelagia, her adopted daughter and the daughter's son, 
the author has mostly used his passion well. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflated at times; at others, "Corelli's Mandolin" is authentically outsized 
and alluring.

THEATER REVIEW; STRONG ACTING HELPS STOP-GAP SPREAD THE WORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 One of the abiding oddities of American culture is that for many kids, their 
first contact with theater isn't in a real theater, where one is accustomed to 
suspending disbelief and surrendering to the powers of illusion, but in a 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Often what they get there is therapy theater, actors doing interactive 
playlets with messages. Some theater people seem bothered that in therapy 
theater, the play is most definitely not the thing. Rather, it is a means to 
one of many ends: understanding AIDS, perhaps, or diversity education, or drug 
or rape prevention. It represents the extreme of an ideology, now dominant in 
U.S. arts funding circles, that art is meant to heal (and that artists who 
would rather disturb had best go elsewhere). 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, STOP-GAP, a troupe based in Santa Ana, has amassed 16 years of 
good indication that its kind of therapy theater does heal. Monday at South 
Coast Repertory, where 18 STOP-GAP actors served up a sampling of the scenes 
and playlets they will be bringing to Orange County and Los Angeles area 
schools in the coming year, the indication was right there on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Two boys named Tim, one 17, the other 16, and a 17-year-old girl named Louise, 
all of them in a drug recovery program, performed scenes from "Under Pressure," 
about a young man driven to drugs through alienation from his callous father. 
From the scenes, it seemed as if the piece (by Robert Knapp, who writes most of 
STOP-GAP's material) blames all the teen's problems on the father, which may or 
may not be a good message. But the recovering kids themselves appeared and 
sounded confident and strong -- a good, living message indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, an observer could learn as much from the audience as from the action 
onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting up scenes from the group's newest play, "comPASSION," STOP-GAP 
co-founder and director Don R. Laffoon asked for story ideas about AIDS from 
the audience. A number of young people said they felt the HIV-positive 
character should be a girl who had picked up the virus through sex. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That such a scenario is relatively unlikely might raise questions about the 
AIDS education being offered in local schools. (Laffoon was able to steer the 
plot around to involve the more likely cause of intravenous drug use with dirty 
needles). 
</P>
<P>
 Later during the same piece, a boy in the audience suggested that an AIDS 
victim in need of support and understanding might turn to his or her parents. 
His comment met with a chorus of guffaws. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One hopes that those who guffawed were still in the audience for the last 
scene of the evening, from "When No Means No," a longtime staple of the 
STOP-GAP repertoire. The piece is about a woman named Susan forced to realize 
that she never has gotten over a rape she suffered as a teen-ager. Her mother's 
advice about dating always (and incredibly) had emphasized kissing technique 
over security (another parental screw-up here). Finally in the play, mother and 
daughter come together in understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, so parents and families do matter, and maybe kids should talk to old Mom 
and Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, the scenes involving less pressing social issues featured the 
best, most energetic acting. Tracy Merrifield, Ron Santos and Patrick Vivanco 
were funny in "You Decide," a story of peer pressure and dominance. An improv 
scene, "An I for an Eye for an Aye," designed to teach the merits of 
assertiveness and compromise over aggression, got the most laughs, especially 
when Isabella Whitfield burst on as a rude customer in a toy store. The 
audience loved Whitfield -- another reminder why actors, even in therapy 
theater, enjoy playing the bad guy.

BLACK FLAG'S GINN GETS BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Ginn still moves to his own peculiar rhythm. The guitarist and songwriter 
says he has no regrets about abruptly disbanding the pioneering Los Angeles 
punk act Black Flag in 1986 or about his virtual disappearance from the rock 
scene in the years since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never got into music to be a professional musician," says Ginn, speaking by 
phone from outside Seattle during his first long, national tour since the Black 
Flag days. He performs in Los Angeles for the first time in eight years on 
Thursday at the Whisky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been very fortunate to play the music I want," he says. "I feel I 
have to work very hard to stay in that position, to not get trapped into things 
because of money or conventional views of success." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been singer-poet Henry Rollins who has enjoyed the most mileage from 
his years in Black Flag, even if it was Ginn who composed all the music, wrote 
most of the lyrics and created the raucous, jazzbo-punk style that's still 
influential today. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last eight years, Ginn says, he has simply preferred to make his music 
in private, while running his growing SST Records label and playing lots of 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 About two years ago he began jamming with bassist Steve Sharp and drummer 
Gregory Moore. Out of that has come an unexpectedly prolific recording output 
from Ginn -- five albums so far, released both under his own name and as an 
instrumental band called Gone. 
</P>
<P>
 His newest album, "All the Dirt That's Fit to Print," was just released. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pretty much the tip of the iceberg," he said. "I'm always recording, 
pretty much on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
 The current tour has had the trio performing mostly new material, while 
sometimes mixing in a handful of old Black Flag songs, including "Nervous 
Breakdown" and "Jealous Again," all sung by Ginn. 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy of his old group is not something Ginn spends much time thinking 
about. He says that Black Flag ended when he began to feel his creative freedom 
threatened by other expectations within the group.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that they wanted more conventional measurements of success -- and the 
values had changed," he says. "I could no longer keep experimenting like I had 
thought we had." 
</P>
<P>
 While it lasted, Black Flag was at the heart of an underground South Bay music 
and art scene that launched such important local bands as the Minutemen and 
such visual artists as Raymond Pettibon, Ginn's brother. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Lawndale-based SST Records, the small independent label he 
created to release Black Flag's singles, served as an early vehicle for Sonic 
Youth, Soundgarden, the Meat Puppets and other acts of lasting influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginn has mixed feelings about what has been done with the do-it-yourself 
example set by Black Flag and SST, which helped pave the way for the acceptance 
of hard-edged underground rock from the likes of Nirvana. "I like when people 
take the influence and do something good with it," he says. "But if they just 
take something and commercialize it and cheapen it, I'm not proud of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Too much of what's come in the newest wave of alternative rock, he says, is 
"weak, conservative music." And the struggle of bands in the '80s -- finding 
their own club gigs, traveling endlessly in crowded vans on low budgets -- is 
sometimes forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot more opportunity, but at the same time there's been a certain 
amount of stagnation that's set in, inevitably," Ginn says. "It's taken for 
granted and there's less a sense of self-reliance." 
</P>
<P>
 * Greg Ginn, with Rig and Transition, plays tonight at the Whisky, 8901 Sunset 
Blvd., West Hollywood, 8 p.m. $10. (310) 652-4202.

OFFICIALS VOW TO EXPEL INSTIGATORS OF GANG BRAWL AT LEUZINGER HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Centinela Valley School District officials, hoping to calm fears at Leuzinger 
High School, will meet this afternoon with a group of students, parents, 
teachers and local law enforcement officials to discuss a gang-related brawl at 
the school Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the goal of the meeting is to find a way to avoid a repeat of 
the incident, which drew about 35 sheriff's deputies and Hawthorne police 
officers to the campus and led to the arrest of seven youths, including at 
least five Leuzinger students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office has not filed charges against any of the 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators used videotape of the incident shot by campus security guards 
to identify students involved in the fight, said Leuzinger Principal Sonja 
Davis. At least 10 students have been suspended, including three who were 
arrested, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say all students who attacked other students will be 
suspended and either transferred out of the school or expelled from the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students, worried that the violence may continue, stayed away from campus 
Monday, Davis said. Since then, the campus has been calm and most of 
Leuzinger's 2,800 students have returned to class, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the calm, however, sheriff's patrols on and around the campus have 
increased and may continue indefinitely, Davis said.  
</P>
<P>
 The fight, which pitted blacks against Latinos, was apparently started by 
several Latino gang members in retaliation for an off-campus shooting Sept. 14 
that left one Latino dead, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Jacobo, 19, died Sept. 15 at Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center. The 
shooting, which occurred during an argument between three Latino and three 
black youths on Inglewood Avenue near 147th Street, strained racial tensions at 
Leuzinger, where Jacobo was a former student.  
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the tensions, school officials called the meeting today to 
discuss installing a schoolwide outdoor public address system at Leuzinger, 
using hand-held metal detectors, setting up a 24-hour hot line for parents and 
students to voice concerns, and introducing a Safe School Zone policy in the 
district, Supt. Joseph Carrillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Safe School Zone would allow stiffer penalties for drug dealers and anyone 
possessing a firearm in a 1,000-foot area around each school in the district. 
The Centinela Valley school board is scheduled to vote Oct. 11 on the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus administrators began using metal detectors Tuesday as a precautionary 
measure. Officials say they hope screening students at random will keep them 
from bringing weapons to class and deter youths who are not students from 
trying to get on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials will decide Friday whether to keep the detectors.

HARBOR PANEL TO HELP L.A. FIGHT LEGAL CHALLENGE TO FUND ALLOCATION; LAW: 
COMMISSIONERS APPROVE $100,000 TOWARD THE CITY'S DEFENSE EVEN THOUGH THE SUIT 
COULD FORCE RETURN OF $69 MILLION TO THE PORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Port of Los Angeles finds itself in the awkward position of fighting a 
suit that would enrich the port by millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles faces a lawsuit that could make it return $69 million 
to the port. 
</P>
<P>
 But, ironically, harbor commissioners agreed last week to contribute $100,000 
toward the city's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay another $100,000 to retain two Los Angeles law firms, said 
Winston F. Tyler, the port's chief lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Veltman, a retired trucking company owner from West Los Angeles, is 
suing port cities throughout California for the money the cities took from 
their respective ports under state law during the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A special bill passed by the state Legislature during the 1992-93 budget 
crisis permitted cities to take excess funds from their ports. 
</P>
<P>
 Veltman argues that the law is unconstitutional and hopes to force the cities 
to repay the $140 million diverted to the cities' general funds between 1992 
and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The class-action suit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also names the State Lands Commission, the Department of Finance, Lt. 
Gov. Leo McCarthy, state Controller Gray Davis, the cities of Long Beach, 
Oakland, San Diego, San Francisco and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Veltman's attorney, Richard I. Fine, said transfer of the money violates the 
California Tidelands Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't give the money as an outright gift," Fine said. "It's against the 
California Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 He argues that port authority trust funds were established specifically for 
navigation, commerce, fisheries and other harbor uses. The funds, contributed 
by taxpayers, cannot be used to balance city budgets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $69 million the Port of Los Angeles transferred to city coffers is the 
most money paid out under the state law. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, the city diverted $21 million. Harbor commissioners there have 
also agreed to help pay legal fees to fight the suit.  
</P>
<P>
 Other ports in the state handed over a total of $60 million to their cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, however, the port refused to give money to the five cities in 
its region on advice from its attorney, C. Michael Cowett, who said the law is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowett said he expects San Diego to be removed from the suit.  
</P>
<P>
 Fine said it could be a conflict of interest for the Los Angeles and Long 
Beach harbor commissions to help pay for the defense. They are now spending 
more money to block the ports from getting back the funds that they are 
entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles harbor commissioners do not see it that way. Commissioners 
Carol R. Rowen and Leland Wong said the board agreed to pay the $100,000 
because the port, too, is named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision to pay half the initial legal fees does not commit it to 
paying more money as the litigation proceeds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However Tyler, the port's attorney, said the intent of the cost-sharing 
between the city and the port is to continue sharing costs to fight this suit.

MOUNTAIN BIKERS PRODUCE UNHAPPY TRAILS FOR SOME; RECREATION: RESIDENTS AND 
HIKERS COMPLAIN THAT THE CYCLISTS SPOOK HORSES AND FLOUT TRAFFIC LAWS. 
OFFICIALS IN A FEW PENINSULA CITIES ARE DISCUSSING WAYS TO DEAL WITH THE 
SITUATION.

 Marc Smoot is 37, but he feels like a kid again when he rushes down dirt 
trails on his mountain bike. He especially enjoys the sound of crickets and 
smell of flowers when he rides at night, guided by a bicycle lamp as powerful 
as a car headlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoot is among hundreds of cycling enthusiasts attracted to the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula's hilly terrain and freedom of its open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 While Smoot says he is always courteous to other trail users, a small number 
of bikers have failed to follow his lead. 
</P>
<P>
 On the road, cyclists traveling in packs as large as 80 sometimes hold up cars 
and flout traffic laws. And off the road, mountain bikers occasionally clash 
with hikers or spook horses and their riders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past month, officials in two of four peninsula cities have discussed 
ways to keep mountain bikes off horse trails, and another city says complaints 
regarding mountain bikes are increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some (mountain bikers) that are considerate, and some that barrel 
over those hills," says Palos Verdes Estates resident Georgeann Dorn, who sent 
a letter to City Hall complaining about reckless mountain bikers after her 
husband narrowly escaped being run over twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates City Hall, which had never had any complaints about 
mountain bikes before, has received about half a dozen over the past few 
months, said Scotty Steiner, secretary to the City Council and the city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rolling Hills Estates, the equestrian committee also received a complaint 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Rolling Hills, where mountain bikes are banned from horse trails, 
Councilman Godfrey Pernell said at a recent council meeting that he spotted 
bikers near the gated city's trails, and City Manager Craig R. Nealis promised 
to notify Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputies patrol three of four peninsula cities, and say they have not received 
any formal complaints, but if mountain biking became a major issue, they could 
deploy horse, motorcycle or mountain-bike patrols.  
</P>
<P>
 The mountain bike, known for its thick frame and wide tires, has grown in 
popularity over the past several years. But in Rolling Hills Estates, an 
ordinance banning all bicycles from the city's 30 miles of horse trails dates 
to 1979, said City Manager Doug Prichard. Rolling Hills' ordinance dates to 
1990, said City Manager Nealis. 
</P>
<P>
 Violating the ordinances is a misdemeanor, punishable by a $1,000 fine and up 
to six months in jail. But, officials say the ordinances have rarely, if ever, 
been enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest peninsula city, Rancho Palos Verdes, also contains the greatest 
number of off-road trails: about 100 miles. But officials say that less than 
10% are on city property or are officially recognized. Officials add that they 
haven't received complaints about mountain bikers disturbing other trail users. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palos Verdes Estates, police officials say the city's fire trails winding 
through undeveloped areas are off-limits to hikers and bikers, but they rarely 
enforce the ordinance. Prichard attributes any recent rise in complaints to 
students on summer break. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain bikes are banned from horse trails because a mountain bike whooshing 
down a dirt trail can easily spook a horse, causing the rider to be thrown or 
the biker to be kicked. 
</P>
<P>
 But a more serious peninsula problem, say some officials, is caused by street 
cyclists attracted to the peninsula's hilly terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides traveling in packs that may hold up traffic, the cyclists run stop 
signs and break speed limits, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, when a group of cyclists was hogging the road, said Palos Verdes Estates 
Police Sgt. Dan Dreiling, "we rounded them all up and cited them."  
</P>
<P>
 Clarke McTaggart, son of Rancho Palos Verdes City Councilman John C. 
McTaggart, cycles through the peninsula with a group of other cyclists almost 
every Saturday. Clarke McTaggart has also been ticketed by Palos Verdes Estates 
police for running a stop sign. (He says he beat the $111 ticket in court 
because the officer who wrote the ticket was not the one who reportedly saw him 
run the sign.) 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke McTaggart says cyclists do not blow through traffic signs because they 
think they're invincible or above the law, but because they are going slow 
enough to see it is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've certainly gone through stop signs without stopping," Clarke said, "but 
generally I'll look and go." 
</P>
<P>
 As for holding up traffic, Clarke McTaggart acknowledges that large groups of 
cyclists and cars may not mix well. But he said cyclists understand that and 
they try to watch out for cars. The Hermosa Beach resident could not remember 
anyone being hit by a car since he began combing the hills three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone's riding like an idiot," Clarke added, "people tell him."

PORT OF LOS ANGELES; COUNTY WOULD PAY FOR DREDGING DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have agreed to 
compensate the port for any damages if the corps goes ahead with a plan to 
place contaminated landfill in port waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army Corps proposes dredging 132,000 cubic yards of sediment and debris 
from the entrance channel to Marina del Rey and storing it on the ocean floor 
as part of the port's Pier 300/400 expansion project.The plan was rejected by 
the California Coastal Commission last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Army Corps spokesman Fred-Otto Egeler said he expects the corps to 
resubmit the proposal and start work on a long-term solution for buildup of 
debris in the navigation channel at the marina. The commission may approve the 
project if a long-term plan is developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The port, which initially expressed concern about the corps plan, now has "a 
responsibility to respond to the project," Dwayne Lee, the port's deputy 
executive director for development, told harbor commissioners at a meeting last 
week.  
</P>
<P>
 The Harbor Commission agreed to go along with the county's proposal to pay for 
damages if the corps' operations interrupt work on the pier expansion, which 
began Sept. 6.  
</P>
<P>
 Lee said the Harbor Commission needed to act on the agreement because Mayor 
Richard Riordan supports the dredging and disposal plan. SUSAN WOODWARD

POLITICAL NOTES: BROOKS BRINGS IN BIG NAME TO DOLE OUT CRITICISM OF HARMAN'S 
RECORD 
</P>

 BIGWIG FOR BROOKS: U.S. Senate Minority Leader Robert J. Dole(R-Kan.) stumped 
for Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks last weekend in her campaign 
for Congress against Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 At a fund-raiser Saturday at Manhattan Beach Country Club, he tied Harman to 
President Clinton, a favorite theme of Republican challengers across the 
country this season as Clinton's popularity sags. Dole cited a survey from 
Congressional Quarterly, which showed that Harman voted with Clinton 90% of the 
time in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you support President Clinton 80, 90% of the time, 90% in this case, you 
are on the endangered species list all across America," Dole said. "I don't 
think the American people support President Clinton 90% of the time. In most 
states it's 25% or 30%." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole held up a Time magazine photo of a smiling Harman and Clinton after the 
House narrowly voted to back his deficit-reduction plan last year. Brooks has 
started using the picture in her campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad enough you had to vote for it but don't look happy about it," Dole 
said to the crowd of 135 people, most of whom paid $250 per plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those votes include programs helpful to the South Bay, including 
funding for the production of military aircraft, said Harman spokesman Roy 
Behr. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's appearance was as much to boost Brooks' stature as it was to attack 
Harman. Dole gave Brooks a check for $2,500. On his way to the airport after 
the event he promised her campaign manager, John Perkins, that the National 
Republican Congressional Committee would give financial support to the race as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every party from time to time has a good election cycle, and this is a good 
election cycle for us," Dole said. "If we don't make the most of it, it is our 
fault." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PUTTIN' ON THE RITZ: Harman escalated her attacks on Brooks at a fund-raiser 
she held Friday with five other female members of the U.S. House's freshman 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman chided Brooks on several issues and questioned her commitment to 
abortion rights. Many Republicans say Harman gained crossover votes two years 
ago because her opponent, then-Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, 
did not favor abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opponent in this race opposes federal funding of abortions for poor women, 
opposes the assault weapons ban, opposes the crime bill and was once quoted as 
saying that Congress doesn't have any jurisdiction over abortion," she said at 
the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey. "She's wrong on all counts." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks believes that funding of abortions is better made at the local level or 
by private groups, her campaign manager said. She also supports state funding 
of Planned Parenthood programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the crowd of about 270 people supporting Harman were Nancy Daly, close 
friend of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, and Ron Florance Jr., the son of 
Brooks' challenger in the June Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 GAME OF CHICKEN: It was one of the few times Brooks and Harman have crossed 
paths: A town hall gathering of South Bay officials in Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were at the Malaga Cove Library to listen to Sally Katzen, a 
representative of the federal Office of Management and Budget, who tried to 
allay complaints that the federal government imposes laws on cities but doesn't 
give them any money to implement them. A recent example is the Americans With 
Disabilities Act, which requires cities to improve handicapped access. 
</P>
<P>
 There were few fireworks. Brooks asked Harman if her campaign paid for 
Katzen's air fare. In answering no, Harman shot back: "This is not a campaign 
event." 
</P>
<P>
 But participants needed only to look outside to see electioneering. Just out a 
window, someone dressed as a chicken paced back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
 The faux-poultry is the Brooks campaign's way of saying that Harman will not 
agree to a one-on-one debate, as opposed to a League of Women Voters forum 
scheduled for Oct. 2. Harman's campaign says the upcoming event will be debate 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the chicken, Harman spokesman Roy Behr just laughs. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 WHO'S THE NRA?: South Bay lawmakers who supported gun control legislation 
could have a new political action group to reckon with: a local chapter of the 
National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun rights advocates formed the NRA Members Council of the South Bay several 
months ago to become more active in local politics. (It also plans a community 
program to teach gun safety). 
</P>
<P>
 A possible target: Rep. Harman, who backed a five-day waiting period for gun 
ownership and voted last month for the crime bill, which includes a ban on 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not be difficult to get anyone to volunteer against Jane Harman, I 
can tell you that," said Ed Worley, coordinator of NRA Members Councils in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new chapter's parent group has not not endorsed Brooks, who opposes 
attempts to restrict gun ownership, with conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't see a need for the proliferation of weapons of destruction," said 
Brooks' campaign manager, John Perkins. Brooks "would not turn away" NRA 
support, Perkins said, but, he added, "we want to make sure that they know her 
position." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 BOILING POINT: In most years, the campaign for a seat on the board of a water 
district captures very little interest. Candidates rarely campaign. Incumbents 
often go unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this year in the West Basin Municipal Water District. Recently, incumbent 
Charles Stuart and challenger Robert Katherman went to Torrance Superior Court 
to put an end to a dispute over Katherman's ballot statement. Three other 
candidates for the seat were not involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge William C. Beverly ordered the registrar of voters to remove a paragraph 
in Katherman's statement that charged that Stuart received $16,000 to attend 
meetings, water conservation ceremonies and out-of-town conventions. Katherman 
quoted a local newspaper as his source. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart, who has been on the board since 1987, said the passage distorted the 
truth. He said his $16,000 pay was not only for his work with the West Basin 
district, but also as a director on the Metropolitan Water District and other 
committees. He denied that he went on junkets or luxurious trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very pleased," Stuart said of the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
 And surprisingly, Katherman agreed. He said he is now convinced that Stuart 
was fairly paid, and that it would have been "inappropriate" to include the 
paragraph in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherman tried to get his name taken off the ballot, but it was too late. He 
now says he is endorsing Stuart.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EL SEGUNDO; CITY TO REQUIRE PERMITS FOR RAVE GATHERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to control vandalism and crowds, the City Council voted Tuesday 
to require promoters to buy a permit to hold large pay-at-the-door parties 
called raves. 
</P>
<P>
 Police can easily identify parties without permits and clamp down on 
trespassers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will help to nip rave parties in the bud," Councilman Liam B. Weston 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, four to six illegal parties have been held in empty 
buildings or warehouses in the city, Police Chief Tim Grimmond said. Typically, 
the organizers of a rave party pretend to be interested in renting or leasing 
commercial property and then copy the keys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After spreading the word about the location of the party, on the appointed 
night they let themselves in, collect admission at the door, and then leave the 
area before police are aware of the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "The places are pretty much trashed by the time we get there," Grimmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance requires party promoters to meet the Health Department and 
Fire Department requirements for large gatherings and to show that they have 
permission to use the property. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; COUNCIL ASKED TO CURB ROWDY ROCK CONCERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents angry about noise and rowdiness at recent concerts at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills have asked the City Council to tighten control of the events. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing Tuesday, residents complained of music so loud it rattled their 
windows, and of people urinating in public and using profanity that could be 
heard miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the site for these concerts that are by definition loud and 
vulgar," said Carson resident Gary Colbath. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 complaints were lodged after a performance by Metallica, a heavy 
metal rock group, and a Lollapalooza concert tour stop that included the 
Beastie Boys and Smashing Pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The council directed the city attorney to review whether any city ordinances 
could be used to reduce littering and other problems caused by concert-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the power to tell the university to stop these concerts," Mayor 
Michael I. Mitoma said. 
</P>
<P>
 But university officials have made concessions to neighbors. They canceled the 
last two rock concerts scheduled for this year and said they would meet with 
residents to discuss future concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents groups don't want any additional concerts scheduled on the 
campus. They said they plan to involve state and local politicians in their 
effort to prohibit concerts on the Dominguez Hills campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot go on like this, said Colbath, who heads one of the residents 
groups. "Something has got to happen."  
</P>
<P>
 The shows have been held at or near the Olympic Velodrome, an outdoor cycling 
arena built for the 1984 Olympics. The nonprofit Dominguez Hills University 
Foundation raises about $300,000 per year to maintain the facility, said Nick 
Curl, who manages the site. Much of that money comes from the concerts, Curl 
said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: GARDENA; PETITION OPPOSES MARKET NEXT TO WETLAND AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 1,000 residents of Gardena and neighboring communities have signed a 
petition opposing plans to build a market next to a natural wetland area in 
Gardena, organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremiah George of the recently formed Gardena Quality of Life Committee said 
the petition will be presented to the Gardena City Council next month. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials want a vacant 10-acre strip of land at Artesia Boulevard and 
Vermont Avenue developed for a Smith's Food & Drug Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Gardena residents want the land turned into a recreational area that 
would incorporate an adjacent 7.3 acres of wetland forest, known as the Gardena 
Willows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want to see a market go in there because the area is a remnant 
of a huge wetland area, and it's so biologically significant," George said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee held a forum at the Nakaoka Center Monday night to discuss the 
city's plan and alternative uses for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth W. Landau said the issue comes before the council at a 
public hearing on Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be the appropriate time for the alternatives to come forward," 
Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gardena Quality of Life Committee is working with the Los Angeles 
Recreation and Open Space Committee, another residents' group that first 
proposed a recreational alternative to the development. SUSAN WOODWARD

<P>
 The Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation Department will begin constructing 
a center next month to house information and objects reflecting the island's 
history, geology and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1-million, 3,200-square-foot building will be built on a half-acre parcel 
in Avalon Canyon, which the county will lease from the Santa Catalina Island 
Co., said Sandra J. Fiorenza, the department's capital projects manager. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300,000 visitors are expected annually at the center, and admission will 
be free, Fiorenza said. It is expected to open by next summer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will be financed through state bonds and Proposition A funding for 
open space. SUSAN WOODWARD

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; CULTURAL GROUP SINGS THE PRAISES OF SINATRA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Torrance businessman Sam Fuji wants to bring Japanese culture to America, and 
he thinks Frank Sinatra -- or at least the crooner's songs that are karaoke 
favorites -- can help. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronics executive is one of the founders of Nikkei International 
Assn., a nonprofit group that plans to use the culture and traditions of Japan, 
such as karaoke, to promote cultural understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 In karaoke contests, at least one verse of a contestant's song must be in 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 'My Way' they sing the first part in Japanese, and the second in English 
or Spanish," Fuji said. "A lot of American people start learning Japanese that 
way . . . that's what we are aiming for." 
</P>
<P>
 The group plans a national karaoke contest, but also will provide a business 
network, educate people about Japanese culture and raise money for charity.  
</P>
<P>
 Fuji stresses that people of all races and cultures are welcome to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "To understand each other through culture is the biggest goal for us," Fuji 
said. "We always welcome other people to join us too." 
</P>
<P>
 The group will hold its organizational meeting Sunday at Sambi of Tokyo 
Restaurant in Downey.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; HOMES ON MAX FACTOR SITE GIVEN GO-AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rezoning of the 12-acre former Max Factor site at El Segundo Boulevard and 
Van Ness Avenue has opened the way for the construction of 108 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council changed the zone from industrial to residential use last 
week, giving Manhattan Beach developer Bob Comstock a tentative go-ahead for a 
proposed gated community near the city's Holly Park neighborhood. The 
200,000-square-foot Max Factor building would be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 3-1 vote, Mayor Larry Guidi abstained and Councilman Steven Andersen 
voted against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed development, called The Greens, will include eight styles of 
homes that Comstock estimates will sell for $160,000 to $200,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a third of the one- and two-story houses will border the Chester 
Washington county golf course to the north and east of the site. Comstock said 
he hopes to start selling the houses by January and begin construction in the 
spring.  
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to decide next week whether half of the homes will be 
made available through the city's affordable housing program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, the city's redevelopment agency provides low- and 
moderate-income families with money to help make a down payment. Families do 
not have to make payments on that loan until after the primary mortgage is paid 
off or the house is sold, said Bud Cormier, director of the redevelopment 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 If the measure is approved by the council, Cormier said, the agency will set 
aside up to $250,000 of the agency's $650,000 budget for this project. No other 
city money will be used in building or selling the homes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city stands to gain tax revenue if homes are built on the site, 
critics of the plan say additional housing will create new problems for the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some major concerns about the project," Guidi said. It could strain 
city services, including police patrols and local schools, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agent Guy Hocker said the development also could hurt the local 
housing market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have loads of low to moderate housing (in the city) going for very 
low prices," Hocker said. JON GARCIA

PEOPLE: NINE-YEAR PRISON STAY COLORS CHINESE PAINTER'S WORK IN A POSITIVE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, Chinese painter Liu Xun found that 
nine years of hard work with no creative outlet sharpened his sense of color 
and beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 "My painting was totally different" after being in prison, Liu said. "Before I 
just painted what I saw . . . now I use color and mental images to show the 
beauty of nature and society." 
</P>
<P>
 Now 71 years old, Liu has become one of the best-known painters in China. His 
impressionistic works combine elements of traditional Chinese painting and 
Western art. 
</P>
<P>
 From Monday to Wednesday, 36 of his paintings will hang in the Carson 
Community Center as part of the celebration of the facility's 10th anniversary. 
It is the first time his works have been displayed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson Mayor Michael I. Mitoma and Los Angeles businessman Gene Kim met Liu in 
China. Mitoma brought the artist's work to the attention of Carson's Fine Arts 
Commission. Mitoma and the Koreatown Assn. of Los Angeles, which Kim heads, 
arranged Liu's trip after the Fine Arts Commission chose him for the 
anniversary event. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitoma invited Liu to visit because contemporary Chinese art doesn't get much 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis in China is not on art now, it's on economic growth," Mitoma 
said. But through Liu, Mitoma said, he learned about the community of artists 
in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Liu is deputy director of the Beijing Academy of Painting, chairman of the 
Beijing Assn. of Artists and vice chairman of the Literature and Art Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his artistic interests, Liu also runs a major hotel in Beijing. He 
allows the artistic community to gather in the hotel and lets poor artists 
display their work in the hotel's gallery.  
</P>
<P>
 Liu taught himself to paint at 17, after he was assigned to an acting group 
during a stint in the Chinese Army. Being around artistic people encouraged him 
to try other art forms, he said, speaking through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 He does landscapes because places he has visited stick in his mind, he said. 
After contemplating the scene -- often for a very long time -- he paints from 
memory. Once inspired, he works without eating or sleeping until finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Most artists start their painting career too young to be good painters, Liu 
said. His own work has been profoundly affected by his experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Liu's father, a munitions factory worker, died before he was born, and his 
mother, an illiterate laborer, struggled to support the family. One of the 
works Liu brought for the Carson exhibit is a portrait of his mother, whose 
struggle to survive inspired him. 
</P>
<P>
 Liu, who rarely sells his work, gives most of them to friends. He has promised 
to give one to Carson in appreciation for the city's interest in his art.  
</P>
<P>
 The Carson exhibit focuses mainly on his recent works. Liu says the vibrant 
colors in his landscapes reflect a joy that contrasts with the dreariness of 
prison and the other hardships in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the act of completing a painting brings an emotional response.

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; SUB CULTURE; CATALINA ISLAND SINKS TO NEW DEPTHS WITH 
UNDERWATER ATTRACTIONS IN AN EFFORT TO ATTRACT MORE TOURISTS 
</P>

<P>
 The one-man submarine swirls around the wreck of a fishing boat like a Captain 
Nemo ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The encrusted hull of the fishing boat, seen through the sub's glass dome, is 
furry with kelp and overrun with garibaldi and calico bass. The pilot maneuvers 
to get a better look. He is alone on the bottom of the sea until a voice 
intrudes on the vessel's intercom: "What's your depth?" 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-five feet down.  
</P>
<P>
 The pilot is in Catalina Island's Hamilton Cove, where would-be aquanauts are 
trained to captain the 10-foot submarine, the Sea Urchin. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 people have taken the submarine-pilot course, first offered this 
summer by a Canadian company that hopes its personal underwater craft will 
become a recreational rage like Jet Skis. 
</P>
<P>
 And just down the shoreline, the Santa Catalina Island Co. has added a 
semi-submersible boat, the Starlight, that takes three dozen passengers at a 
time on an underwater tour of kelp forests. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few months, the new attractions have opened the depths of 
Catalina's bays and coves to the masses. Although it's too early to tell, 
island officials hope the subs will boost tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest draws that Avalon has are its pristine bays and harbors," 
said Avalon Mayor Ralph J. Morrow. "This helps. It's an adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't have come at a better time. Tourism, the island's lifeblood, 
declined 14% in 1993. This year it is running about 5% ahead of last year.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to hold our own as a legitimate attraction, right there with Knott's 
Berry Farm and Disneyland," said Jon Hardy, owner of Argo Diving Services and 
immediate past president of the island Chamber of Commerce. "We have to create 
legitimate, good rides, to bring people here, ones that don't do any 
destruction to the island." 
</P>
<P>
 As tourist attractions, submarines have caught on elsewhere. Six years ago, 
Atlantis Submarines launched a $79-per-person, 48-passenger submarine tour in 
Kona, Hawaii. The vessels proved so popular there that the company has added 
four more throughout the islands. The company offers similar tours in the Grand 
Cayman Islands, along with a $275-per-person tour of a shipwreck 800 feet 
underwater. 
</P>
<P>
 On Catalina, the passenger submarine Starlight is not completely submerged, 
but its 36 passengers get a similar experience. They sit six feet underwater as 
the pilot, above the surface, steers through Lover's Cove. The vessel replaced 
the Phoenix, a glass-bottom boat that had been in operation since 1931.  
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted something unique," said Joe Caliva, director of sightseeing for 
Santa Catalina Island Co. "We wanted to try to get Catalina on the cutting edge 
of what's happening in tourism." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Catalina Island Co. and others have long explored getting submarines 
that could go completely underwater, but a $7.5-million price tag proved too 
costly. By contrast, the Starlight, where passengers are just below the 
surface, costs about $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The $18-per-person tours have proved so popular that the company is 
considering adding another boat, Caliva said. 
</P>
<P>
 On deck, a captain throws food to the fish, causing them to swarm near the 
windows below deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Totally awesome. Is that how you say it here?" Disa Persson, 23, of Denmark, 
said as she looked through the windows at the swarms of topsmelt -- thin, 
six-inch-long fish with neon blue stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fascinated by this," she said. "I really wanted to see the underwater." 
</P>
<P>
 But those who go down in the one-person submarine have more than sightseeing 
as their motive for taking the plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't go down there just for the marine life; you go down there to say 
you've done it," said Kristina Denzler, 23, a diving instructor on the island 
who took the class. "It's a trip." 
</P>
<P>
 The underwater adventure doesn't come cheap. It costs $199 for the three-hour 
pilot class and underwater excursion in the Sea Urchin. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer, the company that owns the sub tried to entice customers by 
placing a full-scale model of it at Avalon Aquatics, a Catalina dive shop. The 
working vessel is launched from a barge at nearby Hamilton Cove. 
</P>
<P>
 There, instructor Jon Council, a former marine researcher in the Pacific 
Northwest, gives students a complete rundown of the sub. The life support 
system, he tells them, includes a scrubber that collects carbon dioxide as a 
pilot exhales; at the same time, a tank fills the sub with oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 A safety diver follows the sub at all times. The vessel is connected to a 
tether and can be pulled to the surface quickly in case of emergency. Pilots 
can also unscrew a bolt and release the sub's weight to make it return to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has had no accidents in 300 or so dives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost idiot-proof," said Denzler, the scuba instructor. "In (scuba) 
diving you have to worry about (pressure) tables and decompression. You don't 
have to here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots lie prone, facing the front glass dome, to operate the controls. Once 
inside, students get a trial run-through, with the sub still on the barge. When 
that is finished, the vessel is lifted into the water. Just partially 
submerged, the sub drifts for a bit, as Council has the pilot check for leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the plunge. When the pilot turns three knobs, air is released from three 
chambers, and the sub gradually sinks. The first few minutes can be a bit 
nerve-racking for first timers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right at first you are checking all the points for leaks," said Timo 
Hakkarainen, 15, of Olympia, Wash., whose uncle surprised him with a lesson 
during a recent visit to the island. "It's going through your head. Then you 
just get enthralled. You just don't even think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 In about seven minutes, the sub glides to 85 feet below the surface. Students 
start the thrusters, which make the vessel move back and forth. Most pilots are 
directed to a boat wreck, a popular scuba diving spot, because it attracts 
marine life. 
</P>
<P>
 On Bruce Moody's first plunge, schools of calico bass and a barracuda swarmed 
the white submarine, perhaps attracted to the light. Other pilots have spotted 
a seal, which dances around the sub and peers through its front and top domes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big difference between seeing something on video and in a camera 
and actually looking at it," said Moody, 34, of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Moody, a scuba diver since he was in his teens, spent time learning the 
controls. Pilots have to learn how to level off the submarine by releasing or 
taking in air. If too much air is brought into the sub, it will rise to the 
surface. That could be a problem if a yacht is in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was concerned about remembering the controls," he said. "You're piloting 
the submarine for the first time. That's why it's more for the adventurer, the 
thrill seeker, the adrenaline junkie." 
</P>
<P>
 Or it's for the technically inclined like John (Scotty) McGregor, 73. A 
retired aerospace engineer, he took the class three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was quite easy to learn," he said. "I was more interested in the 
handling of the submarine than the sightseeing." 
</P>
<P>
 The West Los Angeles resident barely fit in the submarine: He's 6 feet, 4 
inches and weighs 240 pounds. But he did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was more or less filling every inch," he said. "It took a bit of doing to 
get me in." 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor, who started scuba diving in the late 1940s, has wanted to go solo in 
a submarine since a visit to the Grand Cayman Islands, where the pilots in a 
research sub let him man the controls with their close supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Urchin, McGregor said, has him hooked. He wants to take a more 
advanced course that will soon be offered in Vancouver, B.C., where pilots 
learn how to operate submarines that go to great depths. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The class is all part of Sea Urchin Submersibles' plans to put subs in the 
hands of the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underwater is a huge, unexplored area of the world that is not tapped 
out," said company director Jonathan Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, subs like the Sea Urchin have been marketed to researchers, 
oil companies and the military. Newman's company and a manufacturer, 
International Hardsuits Inc., have joined together to mass-produce the Sea 
Urchin for dive clubs, marine shops and fishing enthusiasts. The price: 
$125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a guy who owns a $17-million jet come in," he said. "He wants to buy 
one for his yacht. . . . We're basically putting out an underwater sports car." 
</P>
<P>
 The company placed the Sea Urchin at Catalina because of its proximity to a 
large market. But with the tourist season coming to a close on the island, the 
sub is headed elsewhere. The vessel will be taken early next month to Jules 
Undersea Lodge, an underwater hotel in Key Largo, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Next spring, company officials say it is likely they will return to Catalina 
with an updated version of the vessel, which can reach depths of 1,000 feet, 
compared to the 300-foot limit of the current craft. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most new pilots, however, aren't as interested in the craft as a marvel of 
technology. They just want an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Litchenberg, a computer programmer and gift shop clerk on Catalina, 
wanted to plunge in the sub ever since she sat next to the pilot of a passenger 
sub on a trip to Hawaii last year. 
</P>
<P>
 She went solo in the Sea Urchin in August. After she surfaced and the sub was 
pulled back to the barge, Litchenberg was eager to tell people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my kids first off," she said. "My son said, 'What happened to your 
claustrophobia?' But it didn't matter. I did it." Alone Underwater 
</P>
<P>
 1) The sub is connected to a barge by a cable and tether. The pilot is 
instructed how to check for leaks and monitor the oxygen level. 
</P>
<P>
 2) A safety diver removes the cable, leaving the tether connected to the sub. 
When the sub drifts about 50 feet from the barge, the instructor gives OK to 
submerge. 
</P>
<P>
 3) The sub is again tested for leaks. The pilot can now begin a slow descent 
to the bottom of the ocean. Safety diver stays with submerged vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 4) The sub goes 85 feet below the surface in five minutes. Pilots attempt to 
get close to lobsters, garibaldi and calico bass in the wreck of a fishing 
boat.

TORRANCE NEIGHBORS DIVIDED ON PROPOSAL FOR MCDONALD'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to construct a McDonald's restaurant on Crenshaw Boulevard has 
divided a Torrance neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents see the golden arches as a nicely landscaped and designed 
property that would be a good use for a vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents foresee choking traffic, Big Mac wrappers blowing along their 
streets, and car and pedestrian traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is proposed for 23601 Crenshaw Blvd., near 236th Street. On one 
side of the property is a Hof's Hut restaurant, and on the other an office 
building. The City Council plans to make a decision on the proposal Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The McDonald's would attract more cars to Crenshaw Boulevard, where traffic 
already has increased since the opening of the Torrance Crossroads shopping 
mall, residents told the council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it increase traffic in the area? Hell, yes," said Larry D. Mikelson, an 
attorney whose office is in the building next to the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikelson said a McDonald's in that location would attract pedestrian and car 
traffic through the parking lot of his office building, creating a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 A petition signed by 34 residents said: "McDonald's will increase traffic, 
noise and pollution in our once-quiet neighborhood. We urge you to vote against 
the building of this McDonald's to keep our streets safe and quiet for our 
families."  
</P>
<P>
 But resident Leonard Kasari said a restaurant would be an improvement over a 
dusty, vacant lot. "I think that their use of the property will improve it." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy came before the council after the city's Planning Commission 
approved the project Aug. 3. City Councilman George Nakano filed an appeal of 
the decision and brought it before the council for review. MARY GUTHRIE

PENINSULA HIGH POSTS 37 MERIT SEMIFINALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Peninsula High School placed 37 students in the semifinals for 
National Merit Scholarships, the most of any school in the state and ninth 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, with almost 2,900 students, finished No. 1 in the state two years 
ago and third last year. Scholarship semifinalists are estimated to represent 
the top 0.5% of the national graduating class.

pool of about 15,000 semifinalists competing for 2,000 scholarships, worth 
$2,000 each, to be awarded in the spring.  
</P>
<P>
 An additional 4,700 students will be awarded scholarships for meeting criteria 
of scholarship sponsors and educational institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Semifinalists were chosen from more than 1 million juniors attending nearly 
19,000 U.S. high schools.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: CAFE & DELI: JUST PLAIN GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many shoppers begin or end an outing on San Pedro's Pacific Avenue at the San 
Pedro Cafe & Deli in downtown San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cafe is a plain place. On one wall, behind the 10-seat counter, hangs a 
poster from the movie "My Little Chickadee" featuring Mae West and W. C. 
Fields. Opposite, nearly hidden behind high-backed vinyl booths on a shelf 
lined with marine artifacts, is a plate commemorating the Three Stooges. 
</P>
<P>
 If you happen to be going out for a long day of shopping (or boating, for that 
matter), you might consider stocking up on the Cafe's manhandler breakfast 
($5.95): two eggs, two sausages, two strips of bacon, two pancakes, a ham steak 
and hash browns. However, most customers go for the biggest sellers -- omelets. 
There is a shrimp omelet ($5.95), mixed with bay shrimp, mushrooms and onions 
and topped with a hollandaise sauce, and an Italian model ($5.95) that features 
sausage, ricotta, mozzarella and marinara sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 11 a.m., the Cafe features a $2.99 special of two eggs; a choice of 
turkey bacon, sausage or turkey sausage; and a choice of buttermilk pancakes, 
beans and tortillas, bagel and cream cheese, or biscuits and gravy, which 
should cover fans of Midwestern, Mexican, Jewish and Southern breakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
 For lunch, the one-third-pound freshly ground hamburgers ($4.25 to $5.25) take 
over the best-seller list. Served on a wheat bun, they come with pasta salad or 
french fries. Among the familiar list of sandwiches is meatloaf ($5.25) with 
jack cheese and grilled sourdough, an open-faced hot turkey with mashed 
potatoes and gravy ($4.95), chicken or tuna salad ($5.65) and chicken fried 
steak ($5.95). 
</P>
<P>
 The San Pedro Cafe & Deli is at 605 S. Pacific Ave . , San Pedro. (310) 
547-0961. Open Monday through Saturday 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday 7 a.m. to 3 
p.m. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

 KEEPING THE PEACE 
</P>
<P>
 Like every teacher and administrator at Leuzinger High, football Coach Fred 
Boehm returned to work this week concerned about racial tensions in the wake of 
Friday's fight between Latinos and African Americans at the Lawndale school. 
</P>
<P>
 Leuzinger's 42-player team includes 21 African Americans and 13 Latinos. A 
division along racial lines could prove disastrous for a team rated among the 
best in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boehm was proud to report that his players, for the most part, stayed out 
of Friday afternoon's fight, which broke out only a few hours before the 
football team boarded buses for a night game at Duarte High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids did a super job of trying to maintain order," Boehm said. "All of 
our kids were wearing their jerseys, so they were very (conspicuous). Our squad 
sort of stuck together and made sure that none of their teammates got wrapped 
up in (the fighting). 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the players in the weight room and off campus as soon as we could. It 
took quite a while to clear the campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Boehm said the incident took its toll on the Olympians, who played poorly in a 
20-20 tie with Duarte. It also didn't help that five starters were held out of 
the game for various reasons, none directly related to the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know (the fight) had an effect, but I don't want to elaborate on 
that," Boehm said. "We have to overcome this type of adversity and maintain our 
focus. I try not to get negative about this. I can understand how emotions get 
very high." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight, which students say involved hundreds, was touched off by last 
week's shooting death of a former Leuzinger student, a Latino, by African 
American youths near Lloyde Continuation High School in Lawndale. Both the 
shooting and the fight involved gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all a part of it," Boehm said. "Just because we're Leuzinger High 
School doesn't mean we can change society for two or three hours every day. 
We're just part of society. . . .If you work here, you have to deal with the 
environment down here. That's the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a lot tougher if we didn't have so many good kids to work with." 
GOING HOME 
</P>
<P>
 For 28 seasons, he was the embodiment of Carson High football, leading the 
Colts to a 235-66-1 record and eight City Section titles. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, however, Gene Vollnogle becomes the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollnogle, who coached Carson from the time the school opened in 1963 until 
his retirement from teaching after the 1990 season, will be on the opposing 
sideline when the Colts meet Los Alamitos in an intrasectional game Friday 
night at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollnogle is a varsity assistant and the junior varsity coach at Los Alamitos, 
located near his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's bringing the JV team down to Carson on Friday," said Carson Athletic 
Director Saul Pacheco, who talked to Vollnogle on Monday. "He's looking forward 
to it." 
</P>

 Carson's struggling varsity team might have a hard time beating its old coach. 
The Colts have been outscored, 77-13, in losses to Bishop Amat and San Diego 
Morse. Los Alamitos is 2-0, ranked No. 2 in the Southland by The Times and has 
the state's longest current unbeaten streak (36-0-1). GOING HOME, PART 2 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County native son will take his football team into hostile territory 
when Hawthorne meets highly regarded Mater Dei (2-0) at Santa Ana Bowl on 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne Coach Dan Robbins attended Mission Viejo High, where he competed on 
the football and wrestling teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's L.A. versus Orange County," Robbins said of the matchup. "I'm excited. 
We don't get much chance to play teams down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne's last game against an Orange County school was an exciting one. Los 
Alamitos beat the Cougars, 20-14, in overtime in the 1991 Southern Section 
Division III quarterfinals in Robbins' first season as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins expects a similar struggle against Mater Dei, ranked third in the 
Southland by The Times. He compares the Monarchs to another Catholic school, 
Loyola, which beat Hawthorne in the 1992 and '93 season openers. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Mater Dei) is just amazingly disciplined," Robbins said. "In their first two 
games, according to the films, they only had two penalties. We've got our work 
cut out for us." ALL IN THE FAMILY 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins is happy with the progress of junior quarterback Siteina Latu, who, in 
his second varsity start, passed for 128 yards and three touchdowns Friday in 
Hawthorne's 22-9 victory over Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has developed every week," Robbins said. "I was pleased with the way he 
ran the team against San Pedro (a 25-14 victory Sept. 9), and I was pleased 
with the way he threw the ball against Culver City." 
</P>
<P>
 Siteina is the third Latu brother to play quarterback for Robbins. Kalvein 
called signals when Robbins was Hawthorne's freshman coach, and Joseph played 
quarterback when Robbins was the sophomore coach. Both older brothers went on 
to play free safety for the varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Siteina's the third and the last (brother)," Robbins said. "He's the most 
talented at the quarterback spot." STAR WARS 
</P>
<P>
 With a 2-0 start, Mary Star's football team has already equaled last season's 
victory total, when the team was 2-8, and is close to matching its victory 
total in the three previous seasons combined. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stars were 3-26 from 1991-93, a dismal stretch in which Dino Andrie was an 
assistant under Mike Marinkovich. Now the coach, Andrie says Mary Star is 
capable of reaching the playoffs for the first time since 1990, the year it won 
the Santa Fe League title. The Stars return to the Santa Fe League this season 
after two years in the Camino Real League. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrie, who played on winning Mary Star teams under Joe Radisich in the late 
1970s, says the program is slowly regrouping. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on our way back," he said. "It takes time. In the last couple of the 
years, we lost a lot of close, heartbreaker football games. I think we needed 
to get over the hump. Our seniors went through some growing pains. Now they've 
matured. The experience is showing." 
</P>
<P>
 Depth remains a problem at Mary Star -- the varsity has only 21 players -- but 
there's no shortage of talent. In Saturday's 27-7 victory over Narbonne, Iggy 
Galaz returned the opening kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown and tailback Danny 
Pulu rushed for 174 yards and two TDs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Narbonne has 1,800 kids and we have 270," Andrie said. "I think that makes 
(Saturday's victory) even more of an accomplishment." UNDER CONTROL 
</P>
<P>
 Morningside, coming off an 0-9 season, has started the 1993 season 2-0 with 
victories over Inglewood and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the Monarchs must be jumping for joy, right? Well, not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of morale, even when we were 0-9, it wasn't that bad," Coach Ron 
Tatum said. "It's pretty much the same now. We put things in perspective last 
year. We came out and set a goal to improve every week. I think we did that. 
From there, we just ended it and started a whole new chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we still have things in perspective. We've played two (nonleague) 
games. Leuzinger will be the third." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, don't get too down or too excited. Tatum, though, has been 
pleased with his team's play. Standouts have included running back-linebacker 
Donechio Long, running back Peter Suggs, linebacker Darnell Ned and defensive 
linemen Anthony Jenson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs have also gotten a big boost from sophomore Rashaad Reed, who 
plays quarterback and free safety. A talented athlete, Reed reminds some of 
Stais Boseman, arguably the best athlete in school history. NOTABLE 
</P>

 Former Torrance High standout Kim Blankinship, a sophomore outside hitter for 
Loyola Marymount, was named the West Coast Conference women's volleyball player 
of the week. Blankinship had 33 kills, 24 digs and a .362 attack percentage 
last week as the Lions (4-4) lost to San Diego State and beat Colorado State in 
the LMU-Red Lion Hotel Conference Challenge. Loyola travels to South Bend, 
Ind., this weekend to compete in the Notre Dame Golden Dome Invitational, 
facing the host school on Friday and Rice on Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Celeste Adams of Loyola Marymount was named Soccer America's national goalie 
of the week for her performance in a 1-0 victory over ninth-ranked Santa Clara 
on Sept. 11. Adams, a freshman from Bishop Montgomery, had five saves in the 
shutout, which was the biggest victory for the Loyola women's team in two years 
of existence. Adams also was named West Coast Conference defensive player of 
the week. . . .

FINANCES: ASSESSING TAX FOR LIBRARY SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An open letter to Gardena Mayor Donald L. Dear: 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot believe that Gardena, with its relatively solid tax base due to 
playing upon people's vices, has failed to follow Carson and Lomita in 
assessing a mere $28.50 per year, per house, to support library services. 
</P>
<P>
 The library system is the cornerstone of democracy.How can we hope to have an 
informed electorate at all income levels without adequate access to 
information. Instead of finding ways to keep the public out, we should be doing 
everything in our power to bring them in. 
</P>
<P>
 We complain about the youth who seem to have too much time with which to cause 
trouble. "They just aren't as good as we were" is the cry of generations who 
are old enough to be homeowners. However, we extended our school day, and week, 
by spending much time in the library. For $28.50 a year this household is 
willing to offer the same opportunity to today's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to do the right thing. Show a little political courage and 
leadership. Bring the issue back to the City Council and vote for extending 
library services.

MURDER: OFFICIAL ATTENTION TO SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As mayor of Gardena, I want to vehemently protest your newspaper's reference 
to the city of Gardena, which appeared on Sept. 8 in the South Bay section in 
the article "Reopening the Book on a Shocker." The article, written by Jeff 
Kass, is about the book "In the Best of Families." The book "recounts the 
grisly 1983 murder of the wife of Ronald Reagan's personal attorney in Palos 
Verdes Estates." 
</P>
<P>
 What does this have to do with Gardena? Absolutely nothing. That is, nothing 
until palos Verdes Estates Police Lt. Ed Jaakola is quoted as saying, "Suppose 
it had been a murder in Gardena. No one would have cared." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Gardena does care. Gardena is shocked at the reference by a police 
lieutenant that even suggests that there is any comparison from one city to 
another, based on wealth or fame, when a crime occurs, much less such a heinous 
murder as the one referenced. The statement is a personal affront to the 
citizens and dedicated police officers of Gardena. Using the quotation as a 
boldface headline to tease the reader's interest is indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
 As mayor I speak for the citizens and dedicated employees of Gardena when I 
say Gardena deserves better; so does any city. Los Angeles Times staff should 
be censured for stooping to exploitative journalism that features one city's 
newsworthiness at the expense of another. As for Lt. Jaakola, he should at 
least be reprimanded as an object lesson in poor public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 DONALD L. DEAR 
</P>
<P>
 Gardena  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad Lt. Ed Jaakola ("Reopening the Book on a Shocker," South Bay section, 
Sept. 8) works in the rarefied atmosphere of Palos Verdes Estates instead of 
with the lesser mortals who live in Gardena. Believe me, Lt. Jaakola, if it had 
been "a murder in Gardena" we would have cared. Come join the rest of us down 
on Earth.

ANIMALS: CANCELLATION OF FAIR'S ELEPHANT RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Education and Action for Animals commends Mayor Steve Napolitano and the City 
Council for protecting the safety and welfare of Manhattan Beach residents and 
fair-goers by canceling the traditional elephant ride at the 1994 Old Home Town 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, EAA has been lobbying against elephant rides at the fair due to 
the danger of having a wild animal involved in capture, training and constant 
transport. 
</P>
<P>
 Education and Action for Animals, under no circumstances, sanctions or 
supports the use of any animals at the fair. In our continuing efforts to 
educate the public about the cruelty and danger involved with exotic animal 
novelties, we will staff a booth at this year's fair in the free-speech area.

MORMONS: BIBLICAL BASIS FOR THEIR BELIEFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to thank Mary Guthrie and her team for the well-researched article with 
respect to the Mormon Church ("Mission of Diversity," Aug. 18). As a member of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it is good to see 
conscientious attempts to cover all sides of a story. Members of the church 
acknowledge the difficulties of objective reporting of religious issues, but 
this article shows it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the reported comments by Father Gregory Coiro, who is 
identified as a spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, 
mischaracterize the doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints and then suggest that persons who join the church are not "well 
grounded" in Christianity. It is a shame that the Catholic Church, which has 
long experience in being mischaracterized, would engage in such tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that members of the Mormon Church do not believe that they will 
"become God." The question for Mormons is whether Jesus Christ has the power to 
change people or to "make over" souls, into his own image. For Mormons, the 
answer to this question is a resounding "yes." Mormons do not believe that this 
is a process which is completed before death, but that it is part of a process 
of eternal progression. 
</P>
<P>
 One would hope that those who do not believe Jesus Christ has the power to 
infuse believers with his character, would at least acknowledge the 
reasonableness of other Christians in so believing. As Mormons believe and the 
Bible confirms, Jesus Christ sought the intimate unity of believers, "as thou, 
Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us" (John 17:21). 
Believers, eventually, thus "shall be like Him" (I John 3:2) and the ultimate 
goal of the Christian journey is to come unto the "measure of the stature of 
the fullness of Christ" (Ephesians 4:13). 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints thus respectfully 
proclaim the power of Jesus Christ to change lives and to change people to 
become, in eternity, like Him. Over the years, I have discussed these issues 
with Catholic thinkers and clergymen, many of whom have expressed similar 
beliefs as their own. Although members of the archdiocese may believe 
differently, we would hope that they would at least acknowledge, as 
"well-grounded," doctrines different from theirs, but which proclaim the 
atoning power of Jesus Christ whom we worship together.

ENVIRONMENT: WAYS TO USE RECYCLED WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Benning's article in the South Bay edition, "Pitch Touts the Joy of 
Treated Sewage Water," is unfairly critical of recycled water. This is one 
"new" water supply that actually has the potential to fill a good part of the 
huge water deficit predicted for the future of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Mr. Benning chooses pejorative and derogatory expressions to spice up his 
piece at the expense of a perfectly good source of water. Over several decades 
and hundreds of uses of this water, not one user has suffered financial loss or 
any health complaints. That is a very impressive record for a product about the 
raw origin of which Mr. Benning is constantly reminding his readers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that all water is ultimately recycled water, millions of times 
over. Why insist on calling it "treated sewage water" when recycled water is so 
much more appropriate, accurate and attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you ever call the newsprint on which The Times is printed "treated trash 
paper"? Of course not; The Times proudly reminds us that its newsprint contains 
recycled paper. Do you turn up your nose at the beer bottle or can made of 
recycled glass or aluminum? Never! Let us then not be so harsh with recycled 
water that is proved safe, reduces discharge into Santa Monica Bay, and 
provides relief from droughts that are sure to increase in frequency as we grow 
into an even bigger region.

WATCH THE SKY INFLATE; BATTERIES, TIGERS ARE SHAPES OF THINGS TO COME IN TUSTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a member of the Times Orange County 
Edition staff. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Travis will play there. So will the Beach Boys and America. There will 
be a petting zoo, arts and crafts exhibits, plenty of food, carnival rides for 
children and a classic car show. 
</P>
<P>
 A quickie reprise of the Orange County Fair, perhaps? Another "Taste of . . ." 
event? No, this particular happening has something the others don't, and the 
man behind it all isn't shy about pointing it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every town has a 'Taste of Your Aunt Millie's Rhubarb.' Every town has a 
fair," said John Korff. "I mean, nothing against farm animals and cotton candy, 
but this is something different." 
</P>
<P>
 What Korff's festival has is . . . balloons. Hot-air balloons, to be precise, 
more than 100 of which will be floating gracefully over Tustin Ranch and 
environs on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. It's a spectacle that's rare in such a 
populated place -- and, organizers say, downright unprecedented in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Most balloon festivals take place out in the middle of nowhere because, well, 
that's where balloonists usually head. There are more places to put down, a 
consideration since balloons go pretty much wherever the wind takes them. 
There's also less bureaucratic hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing such a festival to Orange County has been a minor logistics miracle, 
with busy airports and skeptical local authorities and crowd-phobic neighbors 
to consider. So why bother? Why not head out to Temecula or Perris or other 
less-congested ballooning meccas? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Smith's Festival of Ballooning has a corporate sponsor to consider, 
a corporate sponsor who wants to attract lots of people to the event. The whole 
thing started last year when Korff, a sporting events promoter with offices in 
Irvine and New York, was attending the famed Albuquerque balloon festival with 
an official of Smith's, a supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smith's guy wondered aloud about launching a new event to bring attention 
to the chain, and Korff suggested a balloon festival. The exec asked what the 
connection would be between supermarkets and balloons, and Korff told him to 
look up at the shaped balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's Tony the Tiger. There's the Ray-O-Vac battery. . . . There's 
Alka-Seltzer. There's a giant condom. I think we have the store covered." 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 shaped balloons will be here over the weekend, most of them sponsored 
by companies. The sky will fill with giant corporate images, bringing the art 
of product placement to new heights -- literally and figuratively. (There will 
also be non-commercial balloons, including three from the Forbes collection: a 
genie, an elephant and a parrot that's 400 feet -- 35 stories -- tall.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has a bad opinion about balloons," said Korff, who has turned a 
balloon festival in New Jersey into one of the state's biggest tourist 
attractions. It was important to start the festival in a major, family-oriented 
population area, he said, and it was important to make a big splash right from 
the start for what he plans as an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't start small and get big. If you start small, you'll never get out 
of puberty," he said. "There's so much stuff (to do) here, people get cynical 
after a while." 
</P>
<P>
 A balloon festival, Korff said, will be unusual enough to get people's 
attention, and he expects as many as 100,000 to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 The ascensions, scheduled once in early morning and once in late afternoon, 
are the spectacular main attraction. Clusters of three and four balloons will 
be released in waves about 30 seconds apart until all 100 or so are airborne, a 
process that takes about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 (The public will not be able to ride in balloons this time around, although 
that may change in future editions of the festival). 
</P>
<P>
 So awe-inspiring is the sight, Korff said, that announcers at balloon 
festivals must remind distracted parents to keep track of small children.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every dad turns into Ansel Adams," Korff said, mimicking a father leaning 
back at an awkward angle to get a shot. "It's a chiropractor's dream." 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't merely a spectator sport, either. "Spectators get down and actually 
help (the balloonists). It's like you're standing in the backfield with Joe 
Montana," said Korff, an enthusiastic showman -- one press release compares him 
to P.T. Barnum -- who likes to cloak his hyperbole in sports metaphors (signing 
up the shaped balloons for the festival is like "getting the Steffi Grafs" of 
tennis). 
</P>
<P>
 Festival-goers who arrive early are often recruited to help crews roll out the 
balloons, which can be several hundred feet high when inflated. Then they might 
be asked to help hold the balloon gondolas earthbound while pilots await their 
turn to head skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 Once aloft, the balloonists will be playing a game of hare and hound. A lead 
balloon goes out with a head start of 15 to 20 minutes and, after floating some 
distance, puts down and rolls out a giant "X" on the ground. The other 
balloonists try to find the spot and drop a bean bag as close to the target as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 It's harder than it sounds. Balloonists follow the breeze, but winds can shift 
after the lead balloon takes off; also, wind direction varies at different 
altitudes.  
</P>
<P>
 There are other navigational competitions as well, with balloonists competing 
for $25,000 in prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning air has been so still of late that balloonists will likely stray 
no more than a mile or so from the launch site. In the afternoon, with a breeze 
blowing, they will probably go four to five miles.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometime between 7:45 and 8:15 p.m., after the balloons have returned from 
their afternoon flight and the sun has set, many will be partially inflated. 
The effect, as they are lit from within by their gas flames in the darkness, is 
called a "balloon glow," and Korff likened it to "huge Chinese lanterns." 
</P>
<P>
 Korff said mornings are the most beautiful time to watch a launch but 
predicted that the late-afternoon ascensions will draw the most spectators, 
largely because of the entertainment that follows. Country star Randy Travis 
will play the main stage Friday night; the Beach Boys and America perform 
Saturday. Both concerts start at 7 p.m.

 Sunday's concert, beginning at 4 p.m., has an oldies theme, with performances 
by ex-Supreme Mary Wilson, the Grass Roots, the Turtles and Gary Puckett. 
Festival tickets ($15 per day, $5 for ages 6 to 12, free for children under 6) 
include general admission seats to the concerts. Reserved seats, also including 
festival admission, are $30. 
</P>
<P>
 Other daily entertainment will include local pop and jazz bands, strolling 
mimes, jugglers, magicians and puppeteers.  
</P>
<P>
 But rising above all, in more ways than one, will be the balloons. And though 
they'll be visible for miles around, Korff -- ever the showman -- couldn't help 
but wish for just a little more attention:  
</P>
<P>
 "My dream situation is to have the wind shift and have the balloons go out 
over the 5 and 405." How a Hot-Air Balloon Works 
</P>
<P>
 As cool air inside the balloon is heated, it expands and becomes lighter than 
outside air. This causes the balloon to rise. Altitude is the only factor a 
pilot can control. The only way to steer is by riding wind currents. Average 
cruising altitude is 3,500 feet. 1) A fan blows cool air into a 60- to 
75-foot-high balloon made of rip-proof nylon. A propane burner is lighted and 
heats the air until the balloon rises. To launch, ropes anchoring the balloon 
to the ground are untied. 2) The flight path is affected entirely by wind. To 
change direction, the pilot heats or cools air inside the balloon, which rises 
or falls in search of currents. 3) To land, the pilot catches a current toward 
the landing area. The balloon descends when hot air is slowly released from a 
vent at top or less propane is burned. Did You Know? * At festivals: Balloons 
may be launched and rise 1,000 to 2,000 feet, then hang in place over the site 
until increasing winds force landings. For rides, balloons are anchored in 
place with a cable and ascend or descend as desired. * Best time to fly: At 
sunrise or just before sunset with winds under 5 to 7 m.p.h. * How high: 
Balloons may fly up to 15,000 feet. * Construction: Modern gondolas are made of 
aluminum and enclosed by wicker. * Pilot training: Must be certified by the 
Federal Aviation Administration, pass a written exam and flight tests and log a 
specific number of flight hours. * How many: There are more than 2,500 sport 
balloonists in the United States. * History 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1700s, French brothers Jacques and Joseph Montgolfier created the 
first hot-air balloon by anchoring the opening of a 35-foot-wide bag to the 
ground over a fire. On Nov. 21, 1783, the first untethered manned hot-air 
balloon flight took place over Paris. During the Civil War, hot-air balloons 
were used to report Confederate troop movements. The official distance record 
for a hot-air balloon flight, a 2,788 mile crossing of the Atlantic, was set in 
1987. Sources: Smith's Festival of Ballooning, World Book Encyclopedia, Times

DEADPAN ALLEY; FOOTBALL FAN KATHLEEN MADIGAN SCORES WITH A SUBTLE STYLE SHE 
CALLS 'SARCASM LIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Madigan is a low-key, engaging comedian. Her subtle style relies on 
imagery and substance. She is not a high-energy stage stalker. So it came as a 
surprise when the St. Louis native talked about how she spends her Sundays: 
glued to the TV set, thoroughly enjoying one of America's more violent 
pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is my favorite sport," she explained earlier this week from her 
rented Hermosa Beach home. "I like hockey, but I wouldn't go out of my way to 
see a game, especially out here. I'm not a Kings fan. My dad and brothers all 
watched sports (when I was) a kid. I talk about sports in my act. I could sit 
on Sunday from 10 a.m. and watch football until the last game is over on TNT, 
watching full-grown men beat the hell out of each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Madigan, who plays the Irvine Improv through Oct. 2, remembers her mother's 
disapproving tone when she asked if her daughter would be perched there all 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, Mom. I'm going to go get a Coke at halftime and come right back," the 
younger Madigan replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fascination with the game has extended beyond passive viewing. She was in 
a fantasy football league last season, but didn't have the time for it this 
year. So for now she's content with making a wager or two on the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sister's Nevada marriage a couple of weeks ago was a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Vegas trying to pick all that stuff. It was perfect because (the 
wedding) only took six minutes out of my gambling time," said the comic, who 
has been on "The Tonight Show" an impressive three times since debuting with 
Jay Leno in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another surprise to find out that Madigan has moved West, especially 
after spending a good portion of her career saying, roughly, that for all she 
cared, L.A. and its incumbent traffic and congestion could break off and sink 
into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done most of the TV stuff," she said, referring to credits that include 
"An Evening at the Improv," "Bob Hope's Ladies of Laughter," a commercial for 
the US West telephone company and the HBO special "Women of the Night III."  
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to do more than that, it's nice if you're out here. I put it off 
as long as I could. Actually, this area is real nice, if you don't have to 
leave. I can walk to the bank. I can walk to the beach. But sooner or later, 
you have to go into the big city." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman with the Midwestern roots is not, however, ready to fully commit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you could talk me into buying out here. Maybe if I had a 
million dollars that I could just let go of and didn't care. Even if I were a 
normal person, I don't think I'd buy something. But I bet you could get O. J.'s 
house real cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 This, she said, points out another way the coast is amazingly different than 
the Midwest. She was surprised to find that celebrities out here have homes on 
the street and that not all of them live in mansions nestled high atop the 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably drove past (O. J's) a million times and didn't even know it. In 
Chicago or St. Louis, (big stars) have huge palatial estates that are far out. 
They are not mixed in with everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Just having a home is a concession for Madigan, 28, who until moving here kept 
her room at her parents' house in St. Louis, figuring it would be a waste to 
set up housekeeping when she's on the road 75% of the time, mainly headlining 
at clubs, with an occasional corporate gig thrown in. College bookings, though, 
she prefers to leave to others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is inviting. It's like Satan calling you. But I just have a problem 
entertaining 18-year-olds. I prefer to work a week of clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to work on your act," she explained, referring to the campus 
promoters and audiences who expect an hour of well-tested material. "It's hard 
to keep their attention. I'm sure No. 1 is Carrot Top. They enjoy him. They 
make me a nervous. . . . Teen-agers, I'm sure, are very nice people as 
individuals, but as a group. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The college circuit today, she contends, is not the same one that Woody Allen 
and others worked 20 or 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't start doing what they want, you'll eat it every night. What they 
want are things they can relate to, which could exclude people over 30." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Madigan's style ("sarcasm light," she calls it) isn't tailored to the 
college crowd, it hits home with just about everyone else. It's clever. It's 
about life. It's challenging. She's been nominated three times as best female 
club comic in the American Comedy Awards.  
</P>
<P>
 Her quick trip to the top was not a calculated move. She earned a journalism 
degree from Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville and went to work for 
an athletic club's in-house magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole career has kind of been an accident," said Madigan, the fourth of 
seven kids. "I never really thought about it, to tell the truth. I had friends 
at the Funny Bone in St. Louis and had been in there enough to see what open 
mike was like. One night a guy and I did it on a dare. I just kept doing it for 
fun. Then, once they paid me, I figured, 'That was easy.' I kept my day job for 
a year and half, then quit." 
</P>
<P>
 She has been doing stand-up for about six years and, as her move to Hermosa 
Beach indicates, she's making a more concerted effort to tap into Hollywood. 
Exactly what she wants to do hasn't crystallized yet, but she knows she's going 
to be careful. She doesn't want to take a sitcom that might bomb, sending her 
back to the clubs to prepare another time-consuming run at the brass ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wide open," she admitted. "I don't think I could be a 9-to-5 comedy 
writer. How many fat jokes can I write? Maybe five to 10 years from now. At 
times, the road gets a little chaotic. The mail is chaotic. Where I'm going to 
be is chaotic. Which is fine for me right now. I'll be the first one to know 
when I snap." 
</P>
<P>
 And just in case the right role comes along, Madigan is putting the foundation 
in place -- which means acting lessons. But she's realistic about her thespian 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to at least get the basics down. I'm not going to be Meryl 
Streep or anything. I won't be playing a Polish immigrant." Kathleen Madigan 
discusses: 
</P>
<P>
 * Her father on education: "He wouldn't pay for our college, and then he would 
say, 'College -- these are the best years of your life.' And I'm thinking, 'Oh 
yeah, right, Dad -- three jobs, junk car, no money. Pinch me, I'm dreaming.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Her bowling career: "I was drunk and needed shoes. I'll give bowlers credit. 
I think they're steroid-free." 
</P>
<P>
 * Motherhood: "I get those maternal feelings, like when I'm lying down on the 
couch and I can't reach the remote control." 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Kathleen Madigan. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Through Sunday, Oct. 2, except Monday, Sept. 26. At 8:30 p.m. Tuesdays

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK

 Those Darn Accordions! "Squeeze This!" F lying Fish  
</P>
<P>
 Those Darn Accordions! is a Bay Area band with 10 members: eight accordionists 
plus bass and drums. What -- they couldn't find two more accordionists? 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, this group doesn't expect to be taken seriously, which makes it that 
much more fun. Go ahead -- just try to hold back a smile during 
accordion-centric reworkings of songs by Grand Funk Railroad ("We're an 
Accordion Band"), the Charlie Daniels Band ("The Devil Went Down to Georgia") 
and, proving that nothing is sacred to squeeze-box players, Jimi Hendrix 
("Fire"). 
</P>
<P>
 Lest it start to sound as if it's one big joke, check out the demonically 
swinging rendition of Louis Prima's Swing Era standard "Sing, Sing, Sing." They 
also deliver a stylistically credible performance of "Viva Seguin," a Mexican 
polka by conjunto music pioneer Santiago Jimenez (Flaco's father). 
</P>
<P>
 The group includes such originals as "The Bowling King" and the truly 
affectionate "The Story of Lawrence Welk," tunes that inhabit a loopy middle 
ground between the B-52's and Talking Heads. 
</P>
<P>
 No, there aren't any enduring philosophical statements. And anyone who has, as 
I do, a dozen or so accordions stashed throughout his house and garage can't 
pretend to be totally objective. That said, and with apologies to Bono, I think 
I have found what I'm looking for. RANDY LEWIS

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kinks, "Arthur (or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)" (1969) 
Reprise  
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, critics hailed the release of two concept albums: this one and 
"Tommy" by the Who. "Tommy" went on to become a feature-length film, a staple 
on classic rock radio and a popular Broadway musical. The equally ambitious 
"Arthur" has received far less attention. Indeed, during much of the '80s, it 
wasn't even available in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arthur" originally was conceived as the score for a British TV musical. The 
project was aborted by financial problems, but thanks to Ray Davies' incisive 
songwriting, this stirring album -- centered on "a plain and simple man in a 
plain and simple working-class position" -- stands on its own as one of the 
decade's finest recorded works. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 12 songs chronicle a number of key events in the life of the fictional 
Arthur Morgan and in the history of the declining British Empire. "Victoria" is 
a tongue-in-cheek idealization of the golden age of Queen Victoria when "life 
was clean" and Britain ruled lands stretching from "Canada to India . . . 
Singapore to Hong Kong." The rousing track is one of the Kinks' most propulsive 
rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the songs on "Arthur" are more subdued and thoughtful. The warm 
and compassionate "Some Mother's Son" tells the story of a young soldier 
brutally killed in a trench during World War I. "Shangri-La," which guitarist 
Dave Davies once called the best single that the Kinks ever recorded, is 
another achingly beautiful song; it finds Arthur trapped in a mundane suburban 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Davies ultimately paints his patriotic protagonist as a bit of a dupe for 
placing his faith in a soulless social system based on material comfort. The 
world can be a cruel place, Davies says -- a sentiment reinforced by "Arthur's" 
unjust position in the shadows of the omnipresent "Tommy."

NIGHT SHIFT: COFFEEHOUSE IN SANTA ANA POURS ON THE CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A favorite pastime among some Orange County residents is griping about the 
lack of culture and community here, and the absence of a downtown hub that 
traditionally breeds these things. But those who know better can tell you that 
great digs filled with exciting people pepper the county map. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even the believers will admit to occasionally whining over distances. 
Their plea: Why can't a few cool places end up near each other, making 
coffeehouse-bar-gallery-club hopping a pedestrian experience? (And let's not 
forget to make that experience one that doesn't shut down by 10 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 That wish is finally coming true along North Main Street in downtown Santa Ana 
where, in between Dark's Art Parlour and the Caged Chameleon art galleries, the 
city's first full-service coffeehouse, Koo's Art Cafe, opened late last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the place full-service because of the tall order that owners Lou 
Bribiesca, Dennis Lluy, Allan Benavides, Dan Montano hope to fill. The four 
spent eight months transforming an abandoned turn-of-the-century house into a 
haven for creativity. The walls, ceiling and trims have been saturated in 
multiple colors, the wood floors marked with a giant sun and moon and the rooms 
filled with comfy cast-off furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a weakly lit neon sign flashing "Koo's Chop Suey" remains in front as a 
reminder of the former Chinese take-out restaurant that inhabited the house 
starting in the 1940s. City records show a minister lived there around 1918.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the twentysomething partners hope Koo's will serve as a community 
meeting place, a study hall, a showcase for local bands of every persuasion, a 
pulpit for everyone from poets to politicians, and (in two months) a gallery 
with monthly exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Bands plug in and perform most Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from 
9 p.m. until about 11 or "when the band poops out," said Lluy, who is 
responsible for booking the talent at Fullerton's all-ages concert hall, the 
Ice House. There is never a cover, so everyone can sample the local music 
scene. The cafe will present Kooslapalooza on Oct. 1 at 6 p.m., featuring eight 
local bands including March, Supernovice, Permanent Green Light, Ice and Back 
Door. 
</P>
<P>
 More traditional coffeehouse fare is offered every Wednesday, which is 
open-mike night after 8 p.m., when patrons display their talents in poetry, 
prose, music and whatever else they like.  
</P>
<P>
 Friday is BYOD night -- "D" as in drum. The Drum Circle, from 7 p.m. to 2 
a.m., encourages everyone who is a drummer or dreams of being one to join in. 
Chanting is optional. 
</P>
<P>
 The percussion instruments patrons bring from home are of every shape, size 
and quality -- as is the rhythmic beat, which could tap the primitive in us all 
and prove a fine outlet for releasing aggression. It's just impossible to hear 
anything over the, uh, music, making the evening a bit of a drag for 
conversation. But Lluy said, "It's more of a vibe thing really, where people 
can come in, make noise and meet people." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it's this whole concept of providing a cool vibe that's really behind 
Koo's Art Cafe. The emphasis here is more on "art" than "cafe," though the 
place does serve a good selection of coffee drinks ($1.50 to $2.50), hot 
chocolate ($1.50) and bottled Hansen drinks $1.25, along with a menu that 
includes grilled cheese sandwiches ($1.50), quesadillas ($1.25) and veggie 
burgers ($2.25). 
</P>
<P>
 Coffeehouse fans need look beyond strictly finding their jolt in the caffeine. 
Koo's lets you go off and get a little cuckoo all in the name of cultural 
expression. And we could use more of that in these parts.

 Athletic events often commit a portion of their proceeds to worthy causes, but 
it's difficult to imagine a bigger success story in the county than the annual 
Race for the Cure, a fund-raiser for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's event raised $271,000, which helped support education, research, 
screening and treatment of breast cancer. One of the programs, for instance, 
offers free mammogram screening for low-income women 40 and older (test prices 
range from $50 to $300). 
</P>
<P>
 This year's running at Newport Center is Sunday, with two 5K runs (one for men 
and women, one for women only), a one-mile adult run/walk and a one-mile run 
for kids. There's also a recognition ceremony for breast cancer survivors, who 
also have a 5K division of their own. The top five finishers will receive 
commemorative awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the event drew 6,500 participants, 2,500 more than its 1992 debut. 
About 500 of them wore pink visors, signifying that they were survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Both courses start and finish in front of the Pacific Mutual building on 
Newport Center Drive, and both feature rolling hills and a downhill finish 
(along with a nice view and ocean breezes). The top three finishers in each age 
group will receive awards. 
</P>
<P>
 From noon to 5 p.m. Saturday, (and again Sunday from 7 a.m. to noon), there 
will be a health and fitness expo with exhibits, live entertainment and 
children's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the run are encouraged to collect pledges (in addition to a 
race entry fee). Of the run's proceeds, 75% will go to local programs, and 25% 
will go the National Komen Breast Cancer Research Fund. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The state will sponsor its second Free Fishing Day of the year Saturday, which 
means it's OK to fish without a license. The lakes at El Dorado East Regional 
Park in Long Beach (just west of the San Gabriel River Freeway at Wardlow Road) 
will be stocked with 3,000 one-pound channel catfish. Festivities and fishing 
are from 8 a.m. to noon. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Race for the Cure run/walk. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sunday, Sept. 25. Registration opens at 6:30 a.m. Morning start times 
are 8:15 for the women's 5K run/walk; 8:27 for the adult one-mile run/walk; 
9:30 a.m. for the men's and women's 5K run/walk; 10:20 for the kids' one-mile 
run/walk (for children 12 and under). 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Starts and finishes at the Pacific Mutual Building, Newport Center 
Drive, Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From Pacific Coast Highway, head north on Jamboree Road and turn 
right on Santa Barbara Drive. Turn left on Newport Center Drive; Pacific Mutual 
will be on the left. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $25 for adults, $15 for children (includes T-shirt).

SPECIAL SCREENING: BOWERS EXPLORES HISTORY VIA DOCUMENTARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 "We just don't think there's any question that cinema is the art of our modern 
culture," says Brian Langston, a spokesman for the Bowers Museum of Cultural 
Art in Santa Ana. "We couldn't think of not being involved in film to augment 
our programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Though known as a showcase of more traditional paintings, sculpture and 
crafts, the Bowers has stepped up its commitment in recent years to offering 
films as part of its admission, Langston explains. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent Italian film series -- which featured Vittorio De Sica's "The 
Bicycle Thief" and Federico Fellini's "La Strada," among others -- is a good 
example. An ongoing series of documentaries, which continues tonight with "The 
'20s: From Illusion to Disillusion," is another. 
</P>
<P>
 This 80-minute film uses newsreel and other archival footage to describe the 
world during the 1920s. Covered are the stock market crash of 1929, the 
emergence of Charles Lindbergh and Ernest Hemingway, and the rise of Hitler and 
Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 29, three short films (each about 15 minutes long) arrive. The first 
looks at the life of filmmaker D. W. Griffith, who created "The Birth of a 
Nation" and is generally considered the greatest silent-movie director. The 
others examine the careers of magician Harry Houdini and showman P. T. Barnum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The films (like the one devoted to D. W. Griffith) are valuable, we think, as 
a way to introduce our patrons to the important people in cinema," Langston 
says. "Maybe from there, they'll go on to learn more and see more" of their 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The series takes a traveling approach Oct. 6, when it takes a look at 
Florence, a hub of the Italian Renaissance. "Florence, Portrait of a City," at 
55 minutes, describes the city that was so influential as a cultural center, 
figuring prominently in the development of Michelangelo and other artists. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 13, KOCE Channel 50's production "Visions of California: The Story of 
California Scene Painting 1925-1950" will be shown in conjunction with Bowers' 
ongoing "California, the Golden Years" exhibition of plein-air paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 It's back to the early days of movies Oct. 27 with "Gangsters, Daredevils and 
Earthquakes," a group of four little-known shorts made in the '20s with (as the 
name pretty much implies) outlaws, daredevil stunts and natural disasters as 
the themes. 
</P>
<P>
 W. C. Fields is the subject Nov. 3. The "W. C. Fields Festival," a 68-minute 
biography, features snippets from some of his better-known movies, including 
"My Little Chickadee" and "David Copperfield." 
</P>
<P>
 Another star, albeit a pint-sized one, is featured Nov. 10. "Classic Shirley 
Temple" presents a series of shorts she made during the early '40s, including 
"Managed Money" and "Merrily Yours." 
</P>
<P>
 The full-length silent film "The Mark of Zorro" will screen Nov. 17. The 1925 
movie starring Douglas Fairbanks will be accompanied by Robert Israel on piano. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Fairbanks' contemporaries, Mary Pickford, will be spotlighted Dec. 8. 
Five shorts, all about 10 minutes long, will screen, including "In Old Madrid" 
and "Sweet Memories," both from 1911. 
</P>
<P>
 The last offering of the year, on Dec. 15, is a series of newsreels from the 
'20s, documenting several events, including the play of the New York Giants, 
the speeches of Mussolini and the discovery of Pompeii. 
</P>
<P>
 What: "The '20s: From Illusion to Disillusion." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Today, Sept. 22, at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Bowers Museum of Cultural Art, 2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the Santa Ana (5) Freeway to 17th Street and head west to 
Main Street, then head north. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $4.50 for adults, $3 for seniors and $1.50 for children 12 and 
under. Museum admission includes the series. 
</P>

WHEN WINE AND FOOD ARE VINTAGE, THE PROSE FLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to the Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wine used to be a passion of mine. I tasted a lot, I read even more. But 
temperance eventually held sway, and the rule these days is, a beer after 
skiing, wine on only the most special occasions. Does nirvana count as a 
special occasion? 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I first spotted announcement of a winemaker dinner featuring 
Chateau d'Yquem, considered by many to be the greatest white wine in the world, 
in a handout newsletter from Costa Mesa's Hi-Time Cellars. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner would take place at Antoine in Newport Beach. The menu listed five 
courses, starting with foie gras, to be prepared by Jean-Pierre Lemanissier, 
whom local restaurant writers had recently named chef of the year -- and at 
least five extraordinary vintages of the only Sauternes the French officially 
designate "first great growth." 
</P>
<P>
 My wife ogled the food courses, I the wines; four eyebrows went up and stayed 
there. Then the orbs below alighted on the $275-per-plate price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Right around that time Barbra Streisand -- who's merely like buttah, mind you, 
not foie gras -- had no problem charging $350, with no food of any kind. 
Keeping that in mind, spending less than that on what could be the meal of a 
lifetime seemed almost feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 30 people decided it was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most jaded wine critics find it hard not to lapse into the purplest 
prose when writing about Yquem. Observations run from effusive to 
embarrassingly effusive. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent column, The Times' Dan Berger quoted the "rarely so enthusiastic" 
Oz Clarke's assessment in his "Encyclopedia of Wine": "Your mouth feels coated 
with succulence for an eternity after swallowing the wine . . . no wine in the 
world can touch Chateau d'Yquem." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Asher, in his book, "On Wine," recounts a passage he happened upon in a 
used-book store, in which a wine writer from an earlier generation tells of 
serving a red wine connoisseur his first taste of Yquem: "He passed into 
rapture."  
</P>
<P>
 A pre-dinner champagne reception featured 1976 Salon le Mesnil and 1985 
Perrier-Jouet Fleur de Champagne (the flower bottle competitor of Dom 
Perignon). Several guests retained a glass of the far superior Salon at dinner 
-- as a palate cleanser. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu: Foie gras sauteed with sweet corn and Sauternes sauce with the 1975 
Yquem. Steamed scallops with a seaweed salad and saffron broth with the 1976. 
The 1986, sauteed cod with a lobster sauce gratin. The 1988, roasted squab with 
cabbage and truffle sauce. The 1966 side-by-side with the as-yet-unreleased 
1989, orange mousse Charlotte with chocolate crisps. 
</P>
<P>
 I went in with as critical a palate as I could possibly muster and upon 
sampling the first wine of the evening. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I passed into rapture. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfumed and intense, pineapples, peaches and hazelnuts, amazingly viscous, 
young and fresh. . . . "Like a pretty lady walked by," said Hi-Times Cellar 
owner Chuck Hansen about the aromas.  
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious difference between Sauternes (such as Yquem) and most white 
wines is that they're sweet. Not sort of sweet, like "dry" champagne. Sweet as 
in ambrosial, as in nectar of the gods -- gloriously, mind-bogglingly sweet, 
all thanks to a fungus called botrytis, or "noble rot." But the differences 
don't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of winemakers use machines to pick their grapes; Chateau 
d'Yquem has them picked by hand, a single grape at a time. Other vineyards 
measure yield in bottles or cases; it's been said that each vine at Yquem 
yields a single glass of wine. Most good white wines can improve for a few 
years in the bottle; Yquem can keep for a century or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson bought this wine. He stopped in at the Chateau in 1787 to 
purchase it personally from the Comte de Lur-Saluces. The count's 
great-great-great-grand nephew, the Comte Alexandre de Lur-Saluces, flew in 
from Bordeaux to attend the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to the first course: Foie gras and Sauternes is a classic wine-food 
pairing. Lemanissier's duck liver preparation -- the wine he used for cooking 
was Chateau Suduiraut, among the finest Sauternes next to Yquem -- would surely 
have eclipsed any lesser wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, way bettah than buttah. 
</P>
<P>
 I was unworthy. A Talking Heads song kept going through my head: "How did I 
get here?" But as the 1976 Yquem was put before me, I thought, Y ask Y? The 
wine was massive, tropical, redolent of honeydew melons and orange blossoms, 
and on another plane.  
</P>
<P>
 Satori. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the second course, the menu hadn't even bothered to mention the caviar 
that adorned the scallops, or the heavenly fried leeks with white asparagus on 
the side. But it was the 1986 Yquem that undid me. Add vanilla and spice to 
pineapple and apricots, a myriad of subtle nuances all in action-packed 
concentrations, and a lingering finish that could be measured in minutes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1988 introduced citrus notes alongside the apricot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tastebud orgasm. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 was the baby of the lot and had not yet begun to blossom. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the 1966 at first seemed like an aging dowager enjoying tea and 
crumpets, but with the second sip, she'd only recently gone through the change 
and was still pretty active at the tennis club. On the third sip, she was 
coolly toodling about town in her convertible Jaguar with her young lover, the 
tennis pro. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Those unconvinced that they'd get their money's worth at a dinner like this 
should keep in mind that the younger wines that were served retail for $200 per 
bottle -- at least $250 in restaurants -- while the older vintages we tasted 
can easily double that. 
</P>
<P>
 Most winemaker dinners, however, cost a fraction of the Yquem dinner. To get a 
realistic handle on such events, I also attended a dinner featuring Beringer 
Winery at Raffaello Ristorante in Orange; that meal cost $39. 
</P>
<P>
 At both ends of the spectrum, winemaker dinners are apparently a win-win-win 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 For the restaurateur, a room that might normally be vacant on, say, a Monday 
evening, isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 For the winery, said Beringer representative Mark Pighini, the dinners "show 
the wine in the light you'd like it to be shown -- with food, lots of fun, in a 
casual but classy atmosphere, as opposed to having it stacked three to five 
cases high at the end of a supermarket row." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the public, noted Raffaello owner-chef Mario Petillo: "People love the 
value of these dinners. If you go out and order a dinner like this and pay a la 
carte, and they open five bottles of wine for you. . . . " A table mate cited 
several reasons she attends winemaker dinners. "It's a great value," she said, 
"but mostly it's meeting the different people. Everybody starts out a perfect 
stranger, but by the end of the night. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most winemaker dinners at Antoine run less than $100, but Saturday, the 
restaurant again offers a stellar meal with a $275 price tag: Three vintages 
each of Chateau Petrus -- the pride of France's Pomerol region, consistently 
rated among the best Bordeaux -- and its sister California estate, Dominus, 
will be featured. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is a more modest $50 when Eberle Winery and winemaker Gary Eberle are 
featured at a four-course meal at Sfuzzi Bistro in Costa Mesa on Wednesday. 
Formerly with Estrella River Winery, Eberle has been producing Chardonnay and 
superb Cabernet Sauvignon on his own in Paso Robles for more than a decade.

 You can "Hang 10" tonight at the grand opening of the 10th location of BJ's 
Chicago Pizzeria at a benefit for the Surfrider Foundation, which, 
coincidentally is celebrating its 10th year. The party includes all-you-can-eat 
pizza and dancing to music by the Surftones. Cost at the door is -- you guessed 
it -- $10. Surfrider is dedicated to protecting the world's beaches and oceans 
through conservation, research and education. 
</P>
<P>
 The party starts at 6 p.m. Promoters promise you won't be board.

 Also playing by the numbers, Robert Mondavi Wine & Food Center celebrates its 
fifth anniversary Friday with a five-course dinner, and the price tag is $125 
(and that's 5 cubed). 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Mondavi will host the black-tie-optional event. A different Robert Mondavi 
Reserve varietal wine will accompany each course. For example, executive chef 
Sarah Scott has paired the winery's 1991 Pinot Noir Reserve with loin of 
venison stuffed with wild mushrooms and a Pinot Noir sauce. Dinner begins at 7 
p.m.

 If you're looking for somewhere different to go for Italian cuisine tonight, 
you might consider a Swedish restaurant. Gustaf Anders says arrivederci to 
Sweden for a change, offering a five-course Italian meal and wines to match. 
Included are pasta shells with black truffles and an Italian cheese course. 
Dinner begins at 6:30 p.m.; $59 per person plus tax and tips. 
</P>
<P>
 If you miss the Italian cuisine, you can still catch Verdi and Puccini arias 
at an encore "Evening of Opera" at Gustaf Anders on Monday. Three singers from 
Opera Pacific's Overture Company will perform between 6:30 and 8:30 p.m. 
There's a cover charge of $5 per person.

SWEET, PUNGENT FLAVORS OF INDONESIA CAPTURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Indonesia may be the world's fifth largest country, but its cuisine is not 
well known abroad. Apart from the Dutch, onetime colonial masters of the vast 
Indonesian archipelago, Westerners just don't seem to crave this exotic 
cooking, distinctively perfumed with such ingredients as lemon grass, galangal 
root and coconut milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants like Asian Deli could change that. This Orange establishment 
serves surprisingly good food for its setting, which is best described as 
modest. The interior is little more than a few tables covered in pink oilcloth, 
about a dozen hardbacked chairs and a counter, which is where you order. (There 
is table service if you insist, but it's faster to use the counter.) 
</P>
<P>
 A few batiks and ceremonial masks hang precipitously from the walls, but apart 
from them this could be any mom and pop cafe in the universe. Come casual, even 
to the point of dressing down. Indonesia is hot and humid; no one here will 
object if you choose to dine in a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Deli has been around for several years, but the place was recently 
acquired by Jakarta native Fred de Groot, and food here has improved 
considerably of late. 
</P>
<P>
 De Groot's kitchen is now being run by a wonderful chef from Java named Hapsa, 
who makes occasional forays out of her kitchen to see how guests are enjoying 
the food. I'll wager she is rarely disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to begin a meal is with the finger snacks popular throughout 
Indonesia. Lumpia , for instance -- Indonesian egg rolls, larger and meatier 
than their Chinese cousins, rounded out nicely by minced cabbage and bamboo 
shoots. Or kroket , and if that name sounds familiar, it's because the name 
comes via Dutch from the French word croquette . An Indonesian kroket is a 
crisply fried cylinder of potato stuffed with dry shredded beef. The spicing, 
on the sweet, pungent side, has nothing European about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemper is another good appetizer -- a warm cylinder of sticky rice with a 
filling, here shredded chicken loaded with coriander. Indonesians typically 
wrap lempers in plastic wrap and carry them around like sandwiches. The star 
appetizer is martabak , an egg-rich crepe with a filling of spiced ground beef. 
This restaurant rolls, stuffs and chops a martabak into eight delicious pieces, 
which are then topped with a cucumber peanut relish (they're still to be eaten 
with the fingers) for a remarkably low $1.75.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Satay (also spelled sate) is meat grilled on tiny bamboo skewers, probably the 
best-known Indonesian street food. 
</P>
<P>
 At Asian Deli, the chicken satay comes coated in a sweet glaze, the pork satay 
has a tender crunch. Best of all, though, is sate udang Bali, skewered shrimp 
smothered in a turmeric-based sauce thickened with crushed candlenut, an 
Indonesian cousin of the macadamia with an indescribable flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 A good way to acquaint yourself with this cuisine is to order nasi rames , a 
mixed rice plate. Some of the foods on it are more heavily spiced than others, 
so it's a good barometer for the rest of the menu. For this dish, white rice ( 
nasi ) is surrounded by a quintet of cooked foods: rendang , diced, dry spiced 
beef; telur sambal , a softly boiled egg coated with chili sauce; gado-gado , 
steamed mixed vegetables like tofu and bean sprouts in an unctuous peanut 
sauce; ayam goreng , yellow- colored barbecued chicken rich in spices, and a 
mountain of tiny fried fish and fried peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasi goreng , the Indonesian version of fried rice, is another possibility. 
Hapsa cooks hers with barbecued pork and plenty of egg, making it ideal for 
breakfast and a perfect foil for sambal , the thick Indonesian chili sauce. 
Kwetiau are rice noodles fried and served with a variety of toppings or eaten 
in soup with duck meat or won ton. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Deli does not serve rijsttafel , the traditional Indonesian rice table 
feast that can contain as many as 30 dishes. Instead, you can look for several 
dishes about as far from European influence as is possible to imagine. One such 
dish is called pempek , rubbery fish cakes not unlike Japanese kamaboko, which 
are sliced in half then stuffed with bits of fried egg. 
</P>
<P>
 Ikan bakar rica , which comes in a large glass bowl, is essentially a fish 
curry made with coconut milk. Ikan is the word for "fish" in Bahasa Indonesian 
(Indonesia's official language). In this case, the fish employed is the bony, 
sweet tilapia, cut into chunks, skin still on. Try the curry spooned onto a 
mound of rice steamed in coconut milk; it's wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 Rendang is one more signature dish for fine Indonesian cooks. Almost every one 
of them makes a version of this dish, which is essentially dry meat that has 
been stewed in spiced coconut milk until all the liquid boils off and the meat 
is nearly liquid itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Hapsa's rendang is terrific, the crumbly beef coming in chunks that you mash 
into rice with chili sauce. It's possibly the most intense dish here, and 
definitely the one you remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the least familiar class of Indonesian food is the sweets, which 
mostly seem to be squiggly things floating around in parfait glasses filled to 
the brim with ice, palm sugar and coconut milk. Es cendol is the one with tiny 
green bits of sago-flavored cornstarch. Es kacang is red beans and sweetened 
milk. You might enjoy these desserts on a hot day, but I won't tell you they 
are a must. If you've just gotten hooked on this cuisine, there's no point in 
rushing things. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Deli is inexpensive. Appetizers and pastries are $1.25 to $5. Soups and 
noodles are $2 to $6.25. Indonesian dishes are $3.50 to $8. Drinks and desserts 
are $1.25 to $3.

 How I spent my summer vacation: 
</P>
<P>
 I spent it, nearly every penny, in the shadow of the Space Needle, a blackened 
salmon burger in hand, listening to some of the best music in the world, in a 
beautiful place that was most certainly not Orange County. So there.  
</P>
<P>
 I usually haul up to Seattle over the Labor Day weekend -- not just because I 
have family and friends in the area, but because this is when the city hosts 
its Bumbershoot Festival, which is kind of like our county fair, except instead 
of corn dogs and Three Dog Night, they get ballet, Tony Bennett, grunge rock, 
African music, Allen Ginsberg, Ken Kesey, the aforementioned blackened salmon 
burgers (I sometimes have one in each hand), crab cakes, Lebanese garlic 
chicken, focaccia and corn dogs if you really need one. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a great city, from the museums to the panhandlers. The more recent 
architecture isn't too appalling, and the older stuff more than makes up for 
it, from Victorian houses to jet-age neon business places. It has communities 
that act like communities, a vibrant street life, places to congregate, plus 
the monorail and ever-present Space Needle to give the impression that you're 
in a Disneyland without borders, with that early '60s vibe, where everything 
seems to be leaning expectantly toward the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's all this oxygen stuff here?" string whiz David Lindley asked the 
festival audience, and it is pleasantly disarming, having all this velvety real 
air to breathe. I'd lucked into a red convertible through a free rent-a-car 
upgrade and was so determined to make the most of it I had the top down in the 
rain half the time. Even their rain seems better than we have here, though I do 
admit Seattle isn't my favorite gray place to be come January.  
</P>
<P>
 But in September? You wake up happy; subject the stomach to a breakfast of 
Tabascoed shrimp paella , drenched blueberry pancakes and black coffee at the 
Athenian Restaurant in the Pike Street Market overlooking Elliot Bay; wander 
the old downtown with its inviting mix of style and seed; perhaps go canoeing 
on Lake Washington, gorging on fresh blackberries growing along the shores of 
the arboretum, then hit the festival at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 There, you stop off for the requisite salmon burger, that onion-jeweled orb of 
kings, and hit the performance stages: Richard Thompson weaving his dark Celtic 
musical tapestries; Me'Shell Ndege'Ocello fusing funk, jazz and hip-hop; the 
St. Petersburg Ballet actually being kind of wretched, and Bonnie Raitt playing 
to an audience of more than 30,000. (It probably didn't hurt that, rather than 
a $30 ticket, Raitt's show was included in the $9 festival admission.) 
</P>
<P>
 Things seemed very right with the world when watching South African singers 
Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens dancing and leaping about in lion skins and 
such, celebrating their nation's new freedom, while the sleek monorail glided 
by behind them. It's like that "Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow" they used to sing 
about on Disney's Carousel of Progress. 
</P>
<P>
 I love Seattle so much that I refuse to move there now that so many other 
Southern Californians are mucking it up. Besides, it's kind of fun to stay down 
here and complain. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite part of the old Carousel of Progress ride was on the way out, when 
you'd walk by a miniature model of the "city of the future." It was a night 
scene, all twinkling lights and lagoons, linked by monorails and aerial 
tramways. Everything was clean, modern and tropical.  
</P>
<P>
 I'd probably despise the thing now, having seen the planned-community 
sterility of Irvine. But back then it raised for me the same question Seattle 
does now: How shall we live? 
</P>
<P>
 That question, which definitely warrants being bothered with, presumes that we 
have some actual say over the manner in which we live. That supposition is 
implicit in our way of life, wrapped up in that "life, liberty and the pursuit 
of happiness" stuff. The human-scaled life in Seattle and a handful of other 
U.S. cities gives me hope that we perhaps can create the sort of world we'd 
want to live in. 
</P>
<P>
 But take a good long look down any major O.C. thoroughfare -- at the soulless 
mini-malls, garish billboards and gated condo compounds -- and tell me there's 
anything resembling someone's best intentions involved. Fountain Valley ain't 
exactly Florence, is it?  
</P>
<P>
 I do another column for this newspaper, called Fixations (shameless plug: It 
runs Tuesdays in Life & Style), that covers people in the county who bother to 
be a little different. It's a varied bunch: Barbie addicts, opera-writing 
doctors, tightrope-walking retirees and such. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, through no design, I've hit on a run of stories that could bear the 
heading "Idyllic O.C." -- conversations with people who saw this place at its 
best. Their stories are rich with orange orchards, local dances, beach parties, 
surf, woodies and 16-pound lobsters pulled from local waters. 
</P>
<P>
 These people still see some of that rustic magic in the county, though one of 
them, it should be noted, does so by living in a rock in Laguna Canyon. It may 
not be so easy for the rest of us, though I have to say this past summer may 
have been the most beautiful one I've seen here. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I get so caught up in the day-to-day bustle, I forget I'm even on a 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
 But this summer had an undeniable shimmer to it, in the breeze, the sunsets, 
starlight and other things I rarely bother to notice. It was a great barbecue 
summer. I'd go to them expecting to stay an hour and would still be there when 
the tiki torches were burning out. 
</P>
<P>
 So I've been loving this place more than ever, though it also seems 
bittersweet to me, as if it's a love that's intensified because I know the 
thing is passing away, inevitably as youth. 
</P>
<P>
 I stepped into my back yard one recent morning. The sun was coming in warm at 
an angle, and the sky above was an inverted bowl of pure blue. Solitary as a 
poem, a huge crow circled above the house. As with hawks, its wings only made 
single flaps at lazy intervals, the rest of the time riding currents that must 
have been as palpable to him as ocean currents are to us. Over a quarter-hour 
they slowly spiraled the bird up and away. 
</P>
<P>
 I wondered: From its vantage, did our streets and homes look to him as the 
miniature "city of the future" had appeared to me? The cheap postwar boom 
houses and force-fit condo tracts; the business roofs with their corroding air 
conditioners; the money-sanctioned graffiti of billboards; the anxious, 
ant-like traffic, the asphalt laced over the Earth like a constricting net. Is 
this how we shall live?

3-HOUR TOUR: DIG ANCIENT HISTORY WITH A THAI TO THE PRESENT 
</P>

 Shake out those bones and learn all about fossils at Ralph B. Clark Regional 
Park in Buena Park. There's a whale of a tale to be told, and, in fact, the 
Interpretive Center boasts the most complete adult fossil whale -- "Joaquin" -- 
on display in the world. You can catch your own catfish at the park, but 
there's barbecued catfish, and smaller fish to fry, at Thai Nakorn. 
</P>
<P>
 3:15 to 3:45: Joaquin the Whale was found in Laguna Niguel when a route for 
the proposed San Joaquin Hills toll road was being surveyed. (That proves the 
toll road's good for something.) 
</P>
<P>
 Why was he moved to Clark Regional Park? "This is the only facility in Orange 
County dedicated to fossils," staff paleontologist Lisa Babilonia-Jones 
explained. Joaquin's beautifully preserved 26-foot skeleton is the Interpretive 
Center's star exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Another display uses stacks of National Geographic to show the geological 
history of the park. It's apparently like some giant filo pastry: "As time 
passes, the layers accumulate like magazines on a shelf. . . . The cliffs and 
hills of Clark Park are composed of 21 layers, each of which contains its own 
collection of fossil organisms." 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know there were three types of camel hereabouts during the Pleistocene 
era? Two types have been found at the park, as has an example of our state 
fossil, the saber-toothed cat. 
</P>
<P>
 But my favorite exhibit was the giant ground sloth. You wouldn't know it to 
look at him, but, according to Babilonia-Jones, "over the years the (exhibit) 
cables have stretched, and his bones are out of alignment. Now we're doing 
chiropractic work rather than paleontology." 
</P>
<P>
 The center is one of three facilities in the United States that houses fossils 
from its own dig sites. You can watch volunteers work on the fossils, or if 
you're 18 or older, you can be one of those volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 3:45 to 4:30: Sign in at the center and check out one of two trail guides for 
the same marked path: "Walk on Our Wild Side" is a nature walk, "Rockin' 'Round 
the Park" a fossil walk; both are geared to families. 
</P>
<P>
 Sample entry for the fossil walk: "Hey! Did you bring your scuba gear? At one 
time that is what you would need. You would be under about 150 feet of water 
just offshore. . . . Across Rosecrans Avenue would have been the beach!" 
</P>
<P>
 Fossils were first discovered here in the 1950s, but scientific collecting did 
not begin until 1969. About 4,000 specimens were recovered over the next five 
years. Marker No. 5 on the trail marks the main dig site, LC-40, where 
saber-toothed cat, giant ground sloth and tapir fossils have been found. At 
Marker No. 6, a bench on Coyote Hill overlooks the ball field, oil fields and 
parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
 What is possibly the least visually interesting site, at Marker No. 8, may be 
the most interesting of all. Between 1952 and 1973, 350 million cubic yards of 
sand and gravel were removed from the site then known as the Emery Borrow Pit 
and used to construct the Santa Ana and Riverside freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 4:30 to 5: Mallards, coots and grebes are common sights at the lake. Herons 
and egrets are frequent visitors in the morning, and you'll also spot the 
occasional kingfisher. You can fish for bass and bluegill, but if you're over 
16 you'll need a license. A bridge leads past a playground that has little 
rocking motorcycles to a pretty little island in the middle of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 5 to 6:15: No, Thai Nakorn is not the Asian version of Tiny Naylor. The chairs 
in fact look straight out of IHOP, with a few folding chairs thrown in for good 
measure. There's a mounted deer head, pheasant and framed butterflies on the 
walls at one end of the room, an elaborate woodcarving at another and a 
television in every corner.  
</P>
<P>
 The waiters and waitresses wear little headsets, and don't worry if they all 
take turns coming to the table. We said, "Somebody else is helping us" half a 
dozen times before we figured out they were all supposed to be helping us. We 
started with a salad of barbecued catfish ($5.95); the fish came chopped and 
mixed with a marvelous hot and sour sauce and served on a bed of cabbage, mint 
and other greens. Dried salty beef ($5.95) was like juicy beef jerky, and very 
addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 An innocent request for fried pomfret fish with chili, garlic and sauce ($9) 
brought a look of terror to the face of our waiter-of-the-moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, it's too hot, it's too hot!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When we insisted, he offered to bring the sauce on the side. "That's OK, put 
it right on the plate," we said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sauce came on the side, and what came had little to do with chili and 
garlic and much to do with sweet and sour. There was apparently no way to get a 
taste of the sauce we ordered because, waiter after waiter, all of whom were 
trying to help, explained that the sauce is made fresh and the chef couldn't 
make it unless we ordered another dish. 
</P>
<P>
 While I could have gotten as testy as a saber-toothed cat, the sauce that came 
was wonderful. And a Thai fruit combination ($4) including jackfruit, palm 
seed, water chestnuts, coconut milk and shaved ice soon had me purring instead 
-- content, in fact, as a giant sloth.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; VOLUNTEERS TO CLEAN PARK'S PLAYGROUND

<TEXT>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed to help with a community cleanup of the Las Palmas Park 
tot lot Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should bring their work gloves," said San Fernando Recreation and 
Community Service Director Ed Montan.Volunteers will sand and reseal the wooden 
playground equipment, which has splintered over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup project starts at 9 a.m. and will wrap up about 5 p.m. Volunteers 
can work just an hour or two or work all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get 50 to 75 people to show up, that will be great," Montan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tot lot playground, which has swings, interconnecting tunnels, ramps, 
bridges and ladders, was built in 1991 by volunteers after a $45,000 
fund-raising campaign. It is located at 505 S. Huntington St., San Fernando. ED

AROUND THE VALLEY: THERE'S NO CURBING VAN AND CAB FARE WAR AT BURBANK AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 East and West Germany are unified. North and South Korea are talking about 
talking again. And even the Irish Republican Army is shelving its bombs, for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when will peace come to Burbank Airport, where feuding cabbies and shuttle 
van drivers have for years exchanged nasty glares, disparaging remarks and the 
occasional knuckle sandwich? 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of this long-running rivalry is a dispute over who gets to work 
the curb closest to the terminal and, thus, has first shot at arriving airline 
passengers, the bread and butter of these working-class chauffeurs. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no small matter. Cabbies and van drivers work long hours, with most of 
their income going to gasoline, insurance and the cab companies. The few extra 
fares they can get due to better access is the difference between a steak and 
good whiskey at the end of the day or cold baloney and watery beer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a dog-eat-dog world out there and these drivers are fighting for every 
bone. 
</P>
<P>
 But to understand the turf war, it is important to know the turf. In front of 
the terminal's main exit, there are four median islands that run parallel to 
the building. The first island has a white curb, which everybody knows is only 
for loading and unloading passengers -- from private cars. The next island -- 
with the coveted curb -- is controlled by the shuttle vans, under a decree by 
airport management. The cabbies share the third island, behind the vans and 
about 50 yards from the terminal. And the last island is for the free hotel 
shuttle vans. 
</P>
<P>
 This arrangement ticks off the taxi drivers, who contend they are losing 
business to the shuttle vans because passengers leaving the terminal see the 
vans first. There they are, the cabbies complain, hidden away behind a Berlin 
Wall of shuttle vans, cast into unprofitable outer darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not right," fumed taxi driver Razmik Asaturyan as he cooled his 
heels at the taxi island. "Everywhere else in the country -- Washington, New 
York -- the first curb is for taxis." 
</P>
<P>
 Some van drivers don't see what all the fuss is about. Sure, they have better 
access to passengers, they say, but most of their business comes from 
passengers with reservations anyway. They call the complaints sour grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The taxis resent us because they've been here for a long time and then the 
shuttles come along recently and get a piece of the pie," said Larry Clement, 
who supervises the vans at the airport for a major shuttle line. 
</P>
<P>
 Clement has seen the rivalry between the two sides heat up, even resulting in 
fistfights. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't always like this. About a year ago, the cabbies happily 
controlled the first island while the second was set aside for vans. The van 
drivers, of course, hated that.  
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials moved the cabbies to the third island, setting aside the 
first island for private cars. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not supposed to give one side an advantage over the other, say 
airport officials, who deny there is any rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't tell that to taxi driver Alex Vaktorian. He said cabbies are losing 
fares to the vans, especially elderly and disabled passengers who would rather 
not walk the extra few yards to the taxis' island. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all the airports all over the world, the taxis are first except for here," 
he said, his voice filled with frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gripes extend beyond the dispute over curb space. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides also grumble about a longstanding rule that forbids both taxi 
and van drivers from verbally soliciting passengers as they leave the terminal 
and approach the medians. Each group accuses the other of violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rule is difficult to enforce. If a driver asks, "You need a cab?" 
who's to say if that's a helpful query or verboten huckstering, punishable by a 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say it's unclear if it violates the rule to ask such a question of a 
passenger who has come to their median. Must they remain silent even if a 
prospective passenger seems to be looking for their services? 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the airport instituted new rules last year requiring van drivers 
to park in a waiting area on the outskirts of the airport until a passenger 
notifies a shuttle supervisor at the curb that they need a van. Only then can 
the van drivers pull up to the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 No such rule applies to taxis, who can park at their curb any time, as long as 
they don't overflow the allotted space. Cabs pile up there, misleading 
passengers who see only the taxis into thinking they are the sole option, 
complained Gustavo de Obaldia, a five-year shuttle van veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve this problem, De Obaldia asked airport officials to allow at least 
one van -- a "show van" -- to sit at the shuttle drivers' curb to generate 
interest, but they rejected his plea, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a group of taxis waited for fares and complained about their lot in life 
recently, two women trudged up to the front of the line pulling an overloaded 
luggage cart. Suddenly, one of them lost control of the cart, sending it 
crashing against a parked cab. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision left a four-inch scratch on the taxi's front panel, evoking a 
protest from the driver, who insisted the women pay for the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring his complaints, they suggested that in this life, stuff happens. Then 
they piled into another cab and vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 "See," the cabby griped, "this is part of the problem because people have to 
walk all this way" to get a cab. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, maybe the logic isn't impeccable, but his drift is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Those last few feet. 
</P>
<P>
 One small step for passengers; one big battleground for drivers.

ON THE HAMBURGER TRAIL; A SIMPLE BURGER? IN THE WORLD OF FAST FOOD, THERE'S NO 
SUCH THING -- ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF LAST YEAR'S FOOD POISONINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans -- in a comfortable, familial way -- take hamburgers for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship is not really extended to any other food. Sure, pizza and hot 
dogs are popular. But burger joints are part of the landscape -- much like the 
post office or corner gas station, except much more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even a surge of outbreaks linked to E. coli 0157:H7 bacteria in the last 
21 months -- resulting in more than 700 serious illnesses and four deaths -- 
could slow sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But just what is hamburger? Where does the meat come from? And what is being 
done to prevent a repeat of the E. coli 0157:H7 incident? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The simple, plain fast-food hamburger is actually the result of a highly 
complex series of processes stretching halfway around the world, involving 
thousands of people, incorporating high science as well as manual labor and 
including meat from hundreds of different animals.  
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of last year's food poisonings, Foodmaker's Jack in the Box chain 
has taken the lead in incorporating the latest safety technology into food 
service. Other chains, such as Taco Bell and McDonalds, are close to 
implementing similar system-wide food safety programs but Foodmaker is the 
acknowledged leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are Foodmaker executives committed to ensuring that this never 
happens again at Jack in the Box but they are also instrumental in working to 
find a complete treatment and cure for E. coli 0157:H7 illnesses," said Bob 
Galler, whose 3-year-old died from the infection and who now heads an E. coli 
victims' support group named after his daughter, the Lois Joy Galler 
Foundation. Foodmaker donated $100,000 to the Galler Foundation last January. 
</P>
<P>
 To trace the story of one burger, The Times was given unlimited access to 
follow how the Jack in the Box chain orders, processes, stores, transports, 
laboratory-tests, cooks and serves its hamburgers. Foodmaker Inc., the parent 
company, made private business documents available; no questions were 
considered out-of-bounds. Suppliers and contractors also cooperated, with one 
exception: The Times could not gain access to one slaughter facility, although 
other, similar facilities were toured. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the story of that "simple" hamburger. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, July 5, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 North San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Foodmaker's North San Diego headquarters has high, almost windowless adobe 
walls and a forbidding aspect; it seems more fortress than the support center 
for 1,175 Jack in the Box family restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also busy. The summer months generate some of the year's heaviest 
customer traffic throughout the chain. Preparations are now being made for a 
special promotion in one of the company's six Western regions.  
</P>
<P>
 The previous Thursday -- June 30 -- the marketing group decided to promote 
quarter-pound burgers for the week of July 25 in a region including Los Angeles 
and Seattle. Today, marketing sends an advertising directive to the purchasing 
director, who puts the necessary food orders through to the inventory 
management group. The two staffs are working several weeks in advance and are 
now focusing on food deliveries for the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack in the Box has the most ambitious menu of the fast-food chains with items 
based on five different cuisines: Japanese, Greek, Mexican, Chinese and 
regional American. But the bestseller has always been hamburgers. Only two 
sizes -- a regular 1.6-ounce and a four-ounce Jumbo Jack patty -- are served. 
</P>
<P>
 The company estimates that stores carrying the Jumbo Jack promotion will 
double their sales of the patty that week. In a regular week, the total sales 
from the 65 stores in the targeted region would amount to more than 10 tons of 
quarter-pound patties. This promotion should bump the figure to an entire 
tractor-trailer load of 160,000 quarter-pound burgers. 
</P>
<P>
 The order is punched into a computer terminal linked by modem to the company's 
distribution centers. A copy is sent via computer network to SSI Food Services 
Inc. in Widmer, Idaho. SSI is one of only two Jack in the Box patty suppliers 
and, while unaware until now of the July 25 promotion, its supplies are in the 
pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, July 6, SSI places its orders to slaughterhouses for enough 
beef to fill the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, July 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Widmer, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SSI Foods Inc.'s beef processing facility operates in a world of cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the blistering summer heat, the plant's temperatures are kept at 40 
degrees or below in work areas and sub-zero in freezers. You never know what 
season it is outside the building because inside it is always uniformly, 
bone-chilling cold. 
</P>
<P>
 To stay warm and optimize sanitation, employees are dressed in bulky white 
coveralls, nets for head and even facial hair, hard hats and thick gloves. Some 
wear protective goggles. 
</P>
<P>
 Once every 24 hours, the entire plant is completely disassembled and cleaned 
with soap and hot water, then sanitized with a chlorine-based solution. On-site 
USDA inspectors then check for any sanitary deficiencies before the plant can 
restart production. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look: This is a clean plant," SSI President Kirk Smith insists, pointing to 
stainless-steel equipment that shimmers in the artificial fluorescent light. 
"We make the best product possible. In this business, if garbage comes in the 
door then garbage goes out the door. There is no garbage here." 
</P>
<P>
 In slaughterhouses in Australia, Idaho and Washington state, beef carcasses 
have been butchered in the traditional manner: the leanest meat placed in one 
container; prime cuts sent in another direction, and pure fat placed into 
other, specific boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 At SSI, lean beef and pure fat -- which could be from different ranches, 
states, regions or even countries -- are ground together to a customer's 
specifications and then formed into that familiar round patty. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarter-pound patties being blended by SSI today include meat that is 50% 
lean from the Monfort Co., just down the road in Nampa, Idaho, and meat that is 
90% lean shipped in from New South Wales, Australia. If necessary, and it 
usually is, fresh beef fat from Iowa Beef Processors in Pasco, Wash., is used 
to obtain the target of 26% fat in the quarter-pound patty. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual mixture of this Jack in the Box order will be about 40% American 
beef and 60% Australian beef. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the American beef came from Monfort, a division of food giant Con 
Agra, which culls from ranches within a 200-square-mile area including the 
southwest corner of Idaho, Eastern Oregon, Washington and western Montana. The 
plant handles between 700 and 1,000 head per day. For this Jack in the Box 
order, the beef is from cattle on ranches in Idaho and western Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 After the animals were stunned, bled, skinned, gutted and chilled, Monfort 
sent the beef carcasses through its processing line for butchering. Meat was 
separated manually by an army of butchers and meat cutters. Then Monfort 
trucked the beef in 2,000-pound combo bins up Interstate 84 to SSI to be 
blended into hamburger patties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian beef comes from a large shipment of frozen beef SSI received by 
ocean freighter on June 24 in Oakland. The 2,000-pound bins were then 
transported to Widmer, about an hour north of Boise. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Theno, Foodmaker's vice president for quality assurance and product 
safety, says the Australians make an excellent product that is less expensive, 
even with shipping costs, than similar-quality American meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian beef is a product of Lackley Ltd., a New South Wales-based 
company. The Aussie cattle were slaughtered in Macksville on May 30, or more 
than a month before Jack in the Box corporate officials decided to promote 
quarter-pound hamburgers. (SSI has a standing order for about one million 
pounds of Australia beef per week for Jack in the Box and other clients.)  
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how cold and clean SSI's plant is, you can't tell whether 
harmful organisms are present. Ironically, neither can USDA employees in the 
current federal meat inspection program, who rely on sight, scent and touch to 
identify these invisible threats. In fact, detection of the organisms in 
question requires extensive microbiological testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, SSI operates its own state-of-art laboratory. Neither the in-house lab 
nor independent outside laboratories have ever found E. coli 0157:H7 in SSI 
beef. Monfort has even tested cattle manure looking for E. coli traces but none 
have been found, says Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, three samples are taken from each tractor-trailer load of meat or fat 
that is delivered to SSI for further analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1993 E. coli contamination, Jack in the Box has changed hamburger 
sources. Foodmaker's new policy is strict: If a processor's ground meat tests 
positive for the bacteria more than once, that firm is dropped from the supply 
system. Any product that contains the harmful bacteria, and there have been 
several, is destroyed, Theno says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, July 19, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The human body provides the ideal breeding ground for E. coli 0157:H7 -- the 
organism thrives at about 98 degrees, or average body temperature. Once 
ingested, there is nothing to stop its growth and treatment is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of E. coli's ecology that isn't understood," says Foodmaker's 
Theno. "It is a single cell, simple organism that needs more research. What we 
do know is that 90% of the E. coli cells that may be present in meat, for 
instance, will tolerate freezing temperatures well and just become dormant 
(until thawed)." 
</P>
<P>
 It is no longer enough for Jack in the Box that Monfort has lab-tested cattle 
manure, or that one of its slaughterhouses conducts microbiological surveys on 
each day's production, or that SSI tests both incoming and outgoing meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, every shipment of hamburgers destined for Jack in the Box restaurants is 
placed on hold while Silliker Laboratories of California Inc., located in 
Carson, tests a representative sample for E. coli 0157:H7. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure can take between one and six days, depending on whether any of 
the contaminant is present. Nothing leaves SSI or the other processors until 
the samples have been declared clean by Silliker. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing procedure is done in two steps. The first, which can be completed 
within 26 to 28 hours, can tell only whether the general family of E. coli 
organisms -- which are common in the intestines of both humans and animals -- 
are present. If any organisms are detected, an additional five days of 
complicated microbiological testing determines whether the bacteria are the 
harmful variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Silliker tests ground beef for a number of clients in addition to Jack in the 
Box. The lab says it's getting positives on the first test once or twice a 
month and finding the potentially fatal E. coli 0157:H7 once every four months. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday afternoon, July 19, Silliker informs Foodmaker that SSI's Friday 
production of quarter-pound patties is clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, July 20, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 North San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time Silliker is running the E. coli tests, Foodmaker's own 
Quality Assurance Laboratory is also testing the hamburgers from the previous 
Friday's production at SSI. Technicians will determine whether the patties meet 
the chain's physical, chemical and microbiological specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best line of defense is to make sure the thing is cooked properly," says 
Theno. "A problem or glitch could arise because of the wrong weight, shape or 
size. You can learn that just by cooking." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, two lab technicians are cooking three regular-size hamburger 
patties according to Jack in the Box procedures. Cooking temperatures and times 
are monitored by computer. Once cooked, the burgers are taken off the grill and 
checked for thorough cooking. The patties are torn apart to make sure that no 
pink, uncooked beef remains, a color change that occurs at about 155 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Having experienced the trauma of a food poisoning outbreak that may have been 
caused by improper cooking, Foodmaker has become extremely attentive to the 
issue. The company and an independent manufacturer jointly developed a 
specially designed thermo-probe that is sensitive enough to get an 
instantaneous heat reading in the different parts of the thin hamburger meat. 
</P>
<P>
 After quickly analyzing the three samples both visually and with the 
thermo-probe, the lab tech announces, "everything is cooked." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, July 22, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 City of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to following long-standing safety practices, every refrigerated 
tractor-trailer that unloads at Foodmaker's giant warehouse in Commerce carries 
a vital piece of equipment. Drivers check to see that the seal on the trailer's 
door is intact and that the refrigeration equipment is working. They also check 
the load's temperature. Most importantly, the driver and the warehouse 
supervisor inspect the Stires Temperature Recorder, the equivalent of the black 
box on a commercial airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stires keeps a constant record of the internal temperature of the trailer 
for as many as eight days. Soon after going to work for Jack in the Box, Theno 
required that all trucks carry it. 
</P>
<P>
 "One year ago we would do a visual inspection of the truck and a temperature 
check upon arrival but we wouldn't know what happened inside the trailer in 
Arizona or New Mexico. Now we do," says Les Gardner, distribution center 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Foodmaker requires that trucks maintain a temperature of less than 10 degrees 
but prefers the level to remain around zero. A few readings blip upward toward 
10 degrees on the Stires printout for this meat delivery, but all else looks 
good and the truck can be unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Another set of checks begins when Foodmaker delivers patties to the 
restaurants in its own fleet of trucks. Again, the Foodmaker trailers are 
equipped with Stires temperature recorders or an on-board computer that records 
the trailer's temperature.  
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Monday, July 25, the warehouse will deliver the SSI hamburgers. From 
the Commerce warehouse, 440 Jack in the Box restaurants are supplied throughout 
Southern California, Las Vegas and the Colorado River resort area. 
</P>
<P>
 Foodmaker drivers have only 20 minutes to unload their trucks into the 
individual store's freezers. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, July 29, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel Canyon Boulevard, 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch is always the busiest time for fast-food restaurants. Today at the Jack 
in the Box in North Hollywood is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a fast-moving line of cars at the drive-up window. Inside, workers on 
lunch break crowd the counter to order. Families of four sit at tables, their 
plastic trays brimming with paper-wrapped hamburgers, large drinks and French 
fries. The place hums with conversation and laughter. Even an LAPD squad car 
swoops in for a quick stop at the drive-up window. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one months ago, this particular restaurant could have been giving away 
food and not found any takers, but time has dimmed memories of the E. coli 
0157:H7 episode.  
</P>
<P>
 The number of guests eating here is not the only difference. The kitchen has 
been compartmentalized to separate raw foods from cooked, ready-to-eat items. 
No one ever touches an uncooked hamburger at Jack in the Box. All are carefully 
handled with utensils. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack in the Box cooks its hamburgers from frozen patties to eliminate 
guesswork about thawing times, because they are easier to handle and because 
there are no meat juices present that can spread contamination. The cook places 
a quarter-pounder on the 375-degree grill and hits a timer. After a few 
minutes, an overhead digital monitor sounds a sharp alarm, directing the cook 
to flip the burger. It sounds again when the burger has finished cooking.  
</P>
<P>
 The final cooking phase is called the quality flip: The cook turns the patty a 
second time, notches the center with a spatula and makes sure the meat is 
cooked to a brown color throughout. If there is any pink, the burger remains on 
the grill until done. The chain will not serve burgers cooked rare or 
medium-rare.  
</P>
<P>
 The backbone of the Jack in the Box system is a food safety program developed 
by industry food scientists and called Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point 
or HACCP. The program here is represented by series of checklists and reports 
completed by employees as often as once each six-hour shift. Most extensive is 
the HACCP shift checklist, which identifies 33 critical points throughout the 
restaurant that need to be inspected by the manager.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the shift checklist, temperatures of all cooking surfaces must 
be taken twice daily. Another weekly checklist is also required of each 
restaurant, with 54 areas that need review. The weekly list is comparable to 
those used by local health inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a team of company auditors visits the restaurants about once a month 
with its own checklist to make sure each Jack in the Box is operating at 
optimum sanitation and is accurately completing the HACCP checklists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've spent a lot of time in the field traveling to many of our restaurants, 
and I can now say that we have a darned good food safety system," says 
Foodmaker's Theno. "We also believe that we can give something back to our 
industry, and we will share the results of our program at scientific gatherings 
and other industry meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "HACCP (had never been) designed for quick-serve restaurants. It was more 
suited to slaughterhouses and meat processing plants. There has never been this 
kind of safety system for restaurants, and I can now say that it is do-able. 
When we show this to the rest of the industry, it will turn on a light for a 
lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the hamburger that began its journey several weeks before and 
thousands of miles away? It was simple and good. More importantly, there was 
every reason to believe it was safe.

 A Great Leap for Garlic 
</P>
<P>
 Peeling garlic by hand can be painful as well as tiresome. At last there's a 
device that does the vile part of the job for you: the E-Z-Rol Garlic Peeler, a 
floppy tube made from an FDA-approved material that looks and feels like a 
cross between garden hose and Silly Putty. You put your clove in it, press down 
firmly and roll it back and forth briskly with the palm of your hand until you 
hear the peel snap (the instructions refer to a "crinkle sound"). When you 
upend the tube, presto -- out falls the clove, perfectly intact but naked as a 
jaybird. Once you get the hang of it, it works even on those maddening little 
tiny cloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Inventor Ben Omessi designed it for people with disabilities and only thought 
of marketing it generally when he noticed that physical therapists wanted their 
own E-Z-Rols. Currently available at the Christopher Ranch Garlic Store in the 
Glendale Galleria. More Garlic News

</P>
<P>
 When Australian ranchers put out watering tanks for their cattle and sheep, 
they inadvertently caused a population explosion of kangaroos who would 
otherwise not have survived droughts. The excess 'roos have been poaching on 
farms, breaking down fences and obstructing roads in Australia, so about 3 
million kangaroos a year (out of 31 million in the country) are being legally 
culled by "'roo shooters." The skins are used for kangaroo rugs and leather 
goods, and the meat is increasingly being featured in Australian restaurants 
and promoted as "the Australian health meat" to foreign markets such as Japan.

 The CMC Company has a mail-order catalogue of ethnic ingredients. Many of them 
are actually no problem to get if you live near ethnic markets, but others are 
truly hard to find, like black salt (used in the Indian snacks called chats ), 
smoked morita peppers, genuine machaca (dried shredded beef) for enchiladas, 
the macadamia-like kemiri nut (also known as candlenut, essential for 
Indonesian cooking but slightly toxic until cooked -- don't eat them raw). And

 Rapid Ice can chill a bottle of wine to cellar temperature (40 degrees) in 
five minutes. It works so fast because the foil-coated sleeve contains a gel 
that stays soft even at freezing temperatures, so it can mold itself air-tight 
to the bottle and absorb heat quickly. When you're done, store it in the 
freezer, where it folds flat and will be ready to use again in six hours. A 
smaller version, Rapid Ice Mini, will chill beer or anything in a 12-ounce can 
or bottle in three minutes. Available at Williams Sonoma, Brookstone and many 
houseware and department stores. Fish Down, Pigs Up

 America's fish consumption rose in the early '80s but has dipped very slightly

Steakhouse chain: "We're not in the health food business. . . . We don't think 
people want to hear 'no' nowadays." CHARLES PERRY

RELISHING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pickled carrots and pickled cauliflower look innocent enough, and you expect 
-- more or less -- the original flavor of the vegetable. But surprise! The 
vegetables have been transformed into bullets of tang, with only a hint of the 
original flavor. New flavors have taken over: sweetness, or saltiness, or (most 
prominently) the sharpness of vinegar.  
</P>
<P>
 It's no wonder that pickled vegetables and fruits make up the traditional 
relish tray. They add exactly that -- relish -- to a plate of plainly grilled, 
roasted or braised meats or poultry. When pickles are on the menu, a fringe of 
flavor excitement is added to each bite of the other foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the many vegetables coming out of the garden this time of year, there are 
some great candidates for pickling. Carrots, cauliflower, peppers, cucumbers, 
green tomatoes and onions are the most common. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickling is simply a method of preserving a vegetable by keeping it immersed 
in a salty or acid solution that prevents the growth of bacteria. It does not, 
however, prevent the growth of molds, so these relatively quick pickles should 
be stored in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The usual pickling medium is white wine vinegar. Malt vinegar or rice wine 
vinegar can also be used, although they add a bit of color to vegetables. 
Ordinarily you shouldn't use red wine vinegar; it will discolor the produce. 
However, you might actually want a dark-red tinge in sweet and sour pickled 
pears and apples. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I love the bite that vinegar gives to a pickled vegetable, it cries 
out for tempering, usually with sugar or salt. Sweet pickles benefit from the 
sweet-and-sour juxtaposition of tastes. Salty concoctions are often heavily 
spiced with a mixture of celery seed, coriander seed, mustard seed, black 
peppercorns and perhaps cloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick pickling is quite easy to do at home. First, begin with top-quality, 
freshly picked vegetables -- those coming out of the garden this last month of 
harvest. These will retain more of the vegetable's original character. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the vegetables need to be softened so the pickling liquid can penetrate 
them. Hard vegetables such as carrots and cauliflower should be lightly 
blanched in boiling water. Spongy vegetables such as zucchini, yellow summer 
squash and eggplant are salted for a few hours and the liquid is pressed out. 
More delicate vegetables, such as green beans or fresh corn kernels, and slices 
of firm fruits, such as pears and apples, can be covered with a hot brine and 
left to cool. Leave the produce in the brine for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare a 10% brine by dissolving 1 1/2 cups of kosher salt in a gallon of 
water, or 6 tablespoons kosher salt to a quart of water. (A rule of thumb to 
test if the brine is salty enough is that a raw egg will float in a 10% brine, 
with the shell just breaking the surface of the liquid.) 
</P>
<P>
 Once the produce has been softened, drain off the brine and pack the produce 
into containers. Pour hot vinegar over the produce, cover tightly and store in 
the refrigerator for at least two weeks before using. These pickles will stay 
fresh in the refrigerator for up to four months. To make pickles that will last 
longer, use canning jars and follow the manufacturer's procedure for 
preserving.

KIDS ON FILM: 'QUIZ SHOW': NO EASY ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Quiz Show," a congressional investigator (Rob Morrow) looking into the 
quiz-show scandals of the 1950s forces prominent and popular intellectual 
Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) to face the agonizing truth -- that he 
cheated for fame and fortune. (Rated PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Younger children found this movie to be a long, slow slog through the subtle 
ethical dilemmas of a bygone era. The action is all mental, moral and 
emotional. Rather than fistfights, high-tech weaponry or rolls in the hay, it's 
embellished by the big vocabulary words and arcane historical trivia that made 
up the old-fashioned quiz shows and the Van Doren family gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the over-12 set found it more of an interesting jog through recent history 
and seemed to appreciate the lesson about truth-telling.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a pretty good movie," said Pablo Pappano, 13. "Some kids 
might not like it. It might be kind of slow for them because it doesn't have a 
lot of action, but still it's an interesting part of history, and I think it 
should be shown." 
</P>
<P>
 His brother Carlo, 8, acted out his opinion with one thumb up and one down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too slow. They said words I didn't understand," he explained, but 
added, "I liked it when (Van Doren) went on a winning streak, and I liked it 
sort of when he lost. I think he won too many times." 
</P>
<P>
 Summer Chaldu, 12, definitely thumbed it down.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of long," she said. "I wouldn't tell somebody to go see it. It's 
not really boring, but nothing kept happening, so I wasn't really entertained." 
 
</P>
<P>
 The plot, highlighting complex class and ethnic differences, follows the 
handsome Van Doren as he is first tricked, then seduced, into accepting the 
answers before appearing on the game show "Twenty-One." Tipped off by a 
resentful loser, Herbert Stempel, the investigator and Harvard graduate Richard 
Goodwin hopes to bring down the television executives and their sponsor, 
Geritol, for deliberately deceiving the viewers. Instead, the focus turns to 
Van Doren, a professor of literature at Columbia University, who is forced to 
confess in public.  
</P>
<P>
 Most kids thought the movie made too much of the cheating scandal. Summer said 
she agreed with the television executive who told Congress that the hoax was 
just show biz and that no one was really hurt in the end.  
</P>
<P>
 Pablo said he didn't think the contestants should have been given the answers, 
a now forbidden practice, but he was less shocked than the public seemed to be 
in the movie.  
</P>
<P>
 "It came as a shock to a lot of people who lived in that era because you 
didn't really hear a lot about that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 To him, the overriding moral had less to do with television's cheating the 
public than with Van Doren's having to live with his conscience.  
</P>
<P>
 Pablo was most impressed with the scene in which Goodwin confronts Van Doren 
with a subpoena to testify and "the line that when you lie, the hardest thing 
about it is that you have to live with yourself. I thought that was the best 
line in the movie. I think it was really eating at him," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He also liked Van Doren's father. Despite their competitive relationship, 
Pablo noticed the father, as well as the investigator, urged Van Doren to tell 
the truth.  
</P>
<P>
 While his brother could clearly label the good guys (Goodwin) and the bad guys 
(television executives), Pablo saw good and bad in all camps and in most 
individual characters. While some Congressmen were portrayed as morally blind 
backslappers who could only praise Van Doren for his confession, Pablo quoted 
another panel member whose statement brought applause from the gallery: "I have 
to disagree with my colleagues that, for a man of your age and intelligence, 
telling the truth shouldn't need to be commended." 
</P>
<P>
 On the lighter side, Pablo said he appreciated seeing how the '50s looked. He 
learned how wildly popular the quiz shows were back then, and he enjoyed the 
period sets and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wore suits," he said with surprise. "It was really nice how they dressed 
and how their hairstyle was."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; PERSISTENCE PAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anaheim once again is trying to clean up crime-plagued neighborhoods, using 
weapons that include drug sweeps and enforcement of health and safety codes. It 
is a worthwhile effort, but as the city has learned, it requires unceasing 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step in improving one of the affected neighborhoods, known as 
Guinida Lane, was a series of undercover drug sweeps conducted over six months. 
More than 100 alleged buyers and sellers of drugs were arrested. Officer 
Richard Trujillo said police wanted to wipe out "an epidemic" of crack cocaine 
in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Brighter street lights made the area less attractive to criminals, as did 
Trujillo's regular presence. Crimes and calls for help from Guinida Lane both 
dropped sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Sustained effort gets results. Drug sweeps for six months rather than a week 
send the message that police mean business. Keeping one police officer in the 
area for months lets him develop expertise and contacts. And that makes it 
easier to bring together the other vital elements of the improvement program: 
local residents, landlords, businesses and churches, all with a stake in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim had success previously in the Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood. But when 
federal funds for a beat-walking police officer ran out, the city had to drop 
the program, and before long drug and gang activity increased. The current 
programs also are using state and federal grants; the city somehow must find 
the money to continue them for success over the long term.

CITY HALL NEWS: PASADENA; COUNCIL IS UNANIMOUS IN OPPOSING PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday voted unanimously to oppose Proposition 187, which 
would deny most public services to illegal immigrants if approved by voters 
Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Monday, representatives of the Pasadena Unified School District and 
various organizations, including El Centro de Accion Social and the Pasadena 
chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, held a 
press conference on the steps of City Hall to voice their opposition to the 
controversial measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The community leaders said they oppose Proposition 187 because, among other 
things, it would require teachers to report children whom they suspect to be 
illegal immigrants. Those children would then be barred from attending public 
school and would end up on the streets, the opponents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the measure, including Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia), 
contend California taxpayers are spending too much money on services for 
illegal immigrants.

CITY HALL NEWS: SOUTH PASADENA; CITY COST FOR PRENTISS SUIT NOW AT $1.9 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's attorney costs in its legal battle against former Mayor Lee D. 
Prentiss have risen to $426,000, bringing the bill for the case to nearly $1.9 
million, according to City Finance Director Barbara James. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Superior Court Judge J. Michael Byrne earlier this month ordered the 
city to pay $248,000 in legal fees accumulated by Prentiss in addition to an 
outstanding jury award of $1.2 million.In July, a jury gave the award after 
deciding city officials violated Prentiss' civil rights in 1990 by conspiring 
for political reasons to revoke a permit to expand his 86-year-old home.  
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, attorneys representing the city and Prentiss will meet with Byrne 
in an effort to settle the case and avoid appeals.

CITY HALL NEWS: ALHAMBRA; INTERIM FIRE CHIEF TO ACCEPT PERMANENT JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Interim Fire Chief James A. Ballard, a department veteran, will officially 
accept the Fire Chief badge permanently today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballard, 47, was appointed to replace Fire Chief Raymond Brooks on Sept. 12. 
He has served as interim chief since April, when Brooks became San Jose's fire 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over his 25 years of service to the Alhambra community, and in the past 
several months as interim fire chief, Ballard has proved a skilled firefighter 
and able leader," City Manager Julio Fuentes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballard joined the department in 1969 after three years in the U.S. Army. He 
has served as the department's fire marshal and as a battalion chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony will be held at Headquarters Fire Station, 301 1st St., Alhambra.

CITY HALL NEWS: SIERRA MADRE; CITY VOTES TO STAGGER INCREASE IN WATER BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to an outcry from residents over a 182% increase in water bills to 
pay for years of undercharging and poor accounting, the City Council has voted 
unanimously to stagger the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 After City Hall was inundated with calls recently after residents received the 
bills containing new rates, the council decided to delay part of the increase 
to minimize the financial impact on water users during the hot summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to rescind the previous increase, which had brought the rate 
to $2.09 per 100 cubic feet of water. The original price had been 74 cents. 
Instead, the price was set at $1.39 per 100 cubic feet of water until November. 
City officials said that amount is needed to make the water department pay its 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, an additional 49-cent surcharge will be added to bills for 10 
months. The money collected from this surcharge will pay off a $468,000 loan 
from Sanwa Bank. Originally, city officials thought this loan would take 12 
months to pay off, but high water consumption rates is expected to reduce the 
time period. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1997, another surcharge, this one 21 cents, will be applied for 
five years to pay off a $797,566 loan from the Sewer Department.

WESTSIDE WATCH: SEA LIONS SEE A NET GAIN WHEN FISHERMEN NET SHARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water (perhaps partly 
because we told you so in this space a couple of weeks ago) comes news of the 
capture of a 17-foot Great White shark about 15 miles off Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 We had reported that several nervous beach-goers had been spotting fins in the 
water off Westside beaches. But Los Angeles County lifeguards assured everyone 
not to worry -- it was just schools of dolphin. 
</P>
<P>
 OK. 
</P>
<P>
 But what got snagged in San Pedro fisherman Joe Caruso's gill net the other 
day didn't look anything like Flipper. 
</P>
<P>
 The shark, caught by Caruso and his crew aboard the 42-foot Horizon, weighed 
in at two tons, making it one of the largest Great Whites ever caught in these 
waters, according to local biologists and fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal to capture Great Whites unless it is for scientific or 
educational purposes. Fishermen who make such inadvertent catches -- this one 
died in the net as Caruso's crew tried to free it -- must dispose of them at 
sea or bury them, said a spokesman for the Fish and Game Department. (If the 
shark is alive, it must be given to a research institution or released.) 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso said he plans to dump it back in the ocean sans its liver, which a 
local biologist retrieved for research. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said swimmers have little to worry about unless they are swimming 15 
to 20 miles offshore; such sharks almost never venture close to bathing areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some creatures out there apparently were overjoyed at the death of Jaws. 
Caruso said the sea lions around his boat looked especially relieved when they 
saw the shark entangled in the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Caruso: "They started making love to each other, kissing and whatever. It 
was something unusual."

 POLITICAL NOTES: Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) recently stumped for 
Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks, who is trying to unseat Rep. 
Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 At a fund-raiser Saturday at the Manhattan Beach Country Club, Dole made every 
effort to link Harman, whose district includes Venice, Marina del Rey and 
Westchester, to President Clinton. Republican challengers across the country 
have been using a similar strategy as Clinton's popularity sags. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole held up a Time magazine photo of a smiling Harman and Clinton after the 
House narrowly voted to back his deficit reduction plan last year. Brooks has 
started using the picture in her campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad enough you had to vote for it, but don't look happy about it," Dole 
told the crowd of 135 people, most of whom paid $250 a plate. Dole gave Brooks 
a check for $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, meanwhile, escalated her attacks on Brooks at a fund-raiser with five 
other women members of the House's freshman class. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman chided Brooks on several issues and questioned her commitment to 
abortion rights. Many Republicans say Harman gained crossover votes two years 
ago because her opponent, then-Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, 
did not favor abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opponent in this race opposes federal funding of abortions for poor women, 
opposes the assault weapons ban, opposes the crime bill and was once quoted as 
saying that Congress doesn't have any jurisdiction over abortion," Harman said 
at the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey. "She's wrong on all counts."

FATE OF 710 EXTENSION IN HANDS OF FEDERAL HIGHWAY OFFICIAL; FREEWAY: HAVING 
LOST IN THE STATE CAPITOL, SOUTH PASADENA IS NOW LOBBYING IN WASHINGTON AGAINST 
THE PROJECT. ADMINISTRATOR RODNEY E. SLATER HAS NOT YET DECIDED ON FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No one could accuse South Pasadena of not doing everything possible over the 
last four decades to stop the Long Beach (710) Freeway extension from plowing 
through its historic neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the California Transportation Commission gave final state approval to 
the eight-lane highway last week, the city's mayor and city manager were in 
Washington lobbying Federal Highway Administration officials who will decide 
whether to fund the 6.2-mile route through Los Angeles, Alhambra, South 
Pasadena and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension's fate now rests largely with Federal Highway Administrator 
Rodney E. Slater; without the federal funding, the $670-million extension 
cannot go forward. If approved, the roadway linking the San Bernardino (10) and 
Foothill (210) freeways would split South Pasadena in half, threatening nearly 
1,000 homes and six times as many trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel confident federal officials will, as before for the last 30 years, 
not approve the state's project," said Ken Farfsing, South Pasadena's city 
manager, referring to federal rejection of various state studies on the Long 
Beach Freeway. "We have more support in Washington than at the state level" 
</P>
<P>
 Although legal challenges to the route's environmental impact report on behalf 
of the 3.5-square-mile city with 24,000 residents could delay the project five 
years beyond its predicted construction date of between 2005 and 2010, Slater 
is really the city's last hope to kill the extension, say highway lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 "A legal battle is limited and can really only delay the freeway. What it 
really comes down to is political pressure on the Federal Highway 
Administration," said John Phillips, a Washington attorney who fought the 
Century Freeway for Law in the Public Interest, a now-defunct legal agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Although South Pasadena is the lone city in the region opposed to the project, 
it has enlisted an army of preservationists, lawyers, lobbyists and Reps. 
Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) and Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) to fight 
the freeway in Washington. Tucker's opposition stems from his fear that funding 
of the freeway extension would reduce money available for the Alameda Corridor 
project, which would improve the transportation links between the Los Angeles 
harbor area and Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Farfsing said indications are that the lobbying effort is paying off. "I 
believe the federal government will at least ask for a supplementary report on 
the route's impact before a decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena officials are also banking on the Clinton Administration not 
wanting to support Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who backs the extension. It 
can't hurt, either, that the city's former mayor and an outspoken freeway 
opponent, Evelyn Fierro, is now Slater's special assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Wells, leader of the 710 Coalition -- a group of 36 businesses, cities 
and labor unions supporting the freeway -- disagrees. "I am confident the 
federal government will finally close the missing link in the Southland's 
freeway grid," he said. "The people of South Pasadena must accept the reality." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena's hopes of stopping the project got a surprising boost in a 
letter last week from Slater to Rep. Tucker. Slater wrote that he will not make 
a decision on the project until it meets "all federal requirements," including 
clean air and environmental statutes, and until his agency has studied 
questions raised by another federal agency, the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation, which has said the project would devastate historic homes on the 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 That means a decision probably will not be made before 1995, said Tony Kane, 
associate administrator of the highway agency. He said the President's Council 
on Environmental Quality, which resolves disputes between federal agencies, has 
asked for further studies on the number of historic homes that would be 
destroyed and on a $110-million low-build alternative proposed by South 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The low-build approach calls for improvements to local streets, use of devices 
to speed traffic flow and increases in public transit, including the Pasadena 
Blue Line. But state Department of Transportation officials have said the 
low-build plan would increase drive times and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials say only two historic homes would be destroyed by the 
freeway link because most such homes would be moved. But preservation groups, 
state preservation officials and South Pasadena are still examining that 
research. That analysis is expected to be completed by December. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay is good news for South Pasadena, said Elizabeth Merritt, deputy 
legal counsel for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Merritt said 
Caltrans' analysis of historic homes fails to list all the homes it should and 
its critique of the low-build plan uses what she called incorrect data. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact the state approves the project doesn't mean the feds will agree. 
They will be the ones sued and they don't like looking stupid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the federal government approves the route and its environmental impact 
assessment, other hurdles will still exist. South Pasadena officials said they 
would then file their lawsuit of last resort -- what they call the "Armageddon 
lawsuit" -- challenging the adequacy of the route's overall environmental study 
and questioning whether the public knew all the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 A minimum of two years' litigation would then begin, according to those on 
both sides of the 710 debate. South Pasadena could further delay the project by 
suing the state in advance of a federal decision, challenging the fact that 
state officials decided on the route while studies sought by federal officials 
were still outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding from the state and federal government would then become the hurdle. By 
the time the project could begin, early in the next century, the costs are 
expected to have increased to more than $1 billion, with 85% coming from the 
federal purse. Of that amount, $300 million would be needed immediately to 
purchase homes and clear the land. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 
the state transportation commission, the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments and Congress all must approve funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Also unresolved is South Pasadena's say in the project. A bill that would 
allow Caltrans to build the extension without the city's approval has reached 
the governor's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has not decided whether to sign the bill, a spokesman said.

NEW COUNCIL OKS TAX THAT SPARKED RECALL; BUDGET: IN EFFORT TO CLOSE 
$2.3-MILLION SHORTFALL, COVINA LEADERS VOTE 4 TO 1 IN FAVOR OF AN 8.25% UTILITY 
FEE, HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED LEVY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Covina City Council, whose members replaced the entire previous council 
recalled last year for passing a 6% utility tax, voted Tuesday for an 8.25% 
utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "It amazes me," said Hank Vagt, a leader of last year's recall. "The utility 
tax without a vote (of the residents) was the straw that broke the camel's back 
last time. Three of the (current) council members were involved in the Stop the 
Utility Tax Committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Several current council members, in justifying the 4-1 vote to impose the tax, 
said that without it the city faced the loss of its library, parks and 
recreation department, and 77 city workers to make up a $2.3-million budget 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The options which were available became limited," said Mayor Thomas O'Leary, 
a leader in last year's recall campaign. "The choice became either the utility 
tax or a cut in services, which was unpalatable." 
</P>
<P>
 The spending cuts needed to balance the budget would have closed the library, 
the parks and recreation department, and one of the three fire stations, 
Councilwoman Linda Sarver said. Six firefighters and 11 police personnel, 
including eight police officers, would have lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have paralyzed the city," said Sarver, who also was part of last 
year's recall campaign. "Basically, everything that Covina is, which is a 
positive, family-oriented community, would be gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the previous council, which was recalled in July, 1993, said 
they felt vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time they did the obvious," said former Mayor Henry Morgan, who 
was among the five council members recalled last year. "It's amazing it's taken 
them so long. . . . I think my council is owed an apology." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were right two years ago," former Councilman Chris Lancaster said. "I 
guess when you recall a City Council and put in a new one, you get an extra 
2.25% utility tax." 
</P>
<P>
 The previous council passed the 6% utility tax in the summer of 1992. It was 
in place for a year, but the present council decided in October, 1993, not to 
renew it. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wilcox, the sole council member to oppose the decision, said he felt 
there were other ways to fill the budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm not prepared to give up the fight with the state," he said. "I 
wanted to spend at least six months trying to get back the $124 million that 
goes out of our city to the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides seeking to recoup state and county money, Wilcox said, the city could 
have sold its Proposition A funds from the county to another city for 60 cents 
on the dollar to raise $330,000 to $390,000. In addition, he said, it could 
have merged fire services with other cities to trim costs or implemented an 
across-the-board salary cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're totally funded till July 1 of '95," he said. "I think they were 
premature in voting for the tax." 
</P>
<P>
 The tax, which will remain in place for five years, is expected to be about 
$185 for an average household, or the equivalent of one month's utility bills, 
City Manager Fran Delach said. The 6% tax proposed last year would have cost an 
average of $151 per household, or $12.60 per month, according to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility tax, expected to raise $3.6 million to $3.7 million per year, 
should cover the city's $2.3-million cash flow deficit and also provide money 
for street repair. It may add some additional funds for the Police and Fire 
departments, new youth ball fields, and allow the city to reopen its swimming 
pool as well, Delach said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to live in a city where the services and the quality of life 
begin to deteriorate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarver said there was overwhelming support for the decision at the public 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a crowd of about 350," she said. "About 150 or better were people 
who came down to say they enjoyed the community as it was and wanted to keep it 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Vagt said he and other residents who gave momentum to the previous successful 
recall are considering another effort as a last resort to stop implementation 
of the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want a recall and I didn't want one before. But if the council votes 
to enact a utility tax ordinance, I expect there will be a recall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vagt said he is particular angry at Sarver, who he says previously vowed to 
never vote for a tax without putting it on the ballot. "She promised she would 
never back it without a vote of the people, and then she turned around last 
night and changed her mind," Vagt said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sarver said Vagt was misquoting her; her first choice had been to put it 
on the ballot, but she said she had never promised not to enact a tax.

BRIEFLY; PETS: EAR TAGS OFFERED TO IDENTIFY LOST CATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals/Southern 
California Humane Society has initiated a new method to identify lost cats: ear 
tags. 
</P>
<P>
 The group says piercing a cat's ear is a painless procedure and is safer for 
active felines, which face the risk of strangling themselves with an 
identification collar as they roam outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 The tag, a stud disk with two phone numbers engraved on it, is available at 
the Los Angeles SPCA/SCHS, 5026 W. Jefferson Blvd. near La Brea Avenue, for 
$12. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure is not recommended for dogs because there are too many blood 
vessels and nerves in their ears, the group said. 
</P>

TOPICS / SERVICES; COUNTY AGENCY IS A FREE RESOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An El Monte service agency can help people in need get legal assistance, 
psychological counseling, housing, even something as simple as a warm blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the San Gabriel Valley Service Center's assistance is free, and the 
economy has created plenty of people in need. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is the center lacking for clients? People simply don't know the 
county-funded agency exists, said Bertha Urrutia, assistant to the center's 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people paying into the system who are not getting any 
benefits out of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which dispenses advice on everything from rape to minor traffic 
violations, works as a liaison between government agencies and the public. 
Created in 1965, it is designed as a one-stop place for people who need help 
but don't know where to find it. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 United Way study found that the San Gabriel Valley has plenty of 
nonprofit and government agencies offering help to the poor, but that many 
people are unaware of the services available, or have transportation or other 
problems that keep them from seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone who has ever tried to get through to a government agency, it comes 
as no surprise how easy it is to get lost in the system. Many people who call 
the center have been bounced from voice mail to voice mail and are surprised to 
get a human being on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We act as a personal guide to cut through the tangle of bureaucracies," 
Urrutia said.  
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley Service Center is at 3017 North Tyler Ave. in El Monte.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PALOS VERDES ESTATES; REVISED MEMORIAL PLAN WILL BE CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The design of a proposed memorial for two slain police officers and local 
veterans will be considered for the second time Monday when the city's Art Jury 
meets with members of a citizens memorial committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Art Jury, a private committee of six architects, planners and engineers 
who approve building plans, recommended design changes to the memorial at its 
Sept. 12 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in a park across from City Hall, the proposed memorial would include 
benches, a reflecting pond and a sundial illuminating the names of Sgt. Vernon 
Thomas Vanderpool and Capt. Michael Tracy, the officers slain by a gunman in 
Torrance. The estimated cost, to be paid for with donations, is $226,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Art Jury recommended that the memorial not overshadow an existing, small 
memorial to World War II veterans, and that it be more pastoral and classical 
in design. "We just asked them to restudy it, and we'll probably approve it, 
and they'll probably build it," said Corwin Eberting, Art Jury president. He 
added: "We're all for the memorial." 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial was approved by the City Council in August despite the complaints 
of some residents that it was too elaborate for the quiet city of 14,000. JEFF 
KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; PETITION DRIVE LAUNCHED FOR NEW SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A citizens committee has begun collecting signatures on a petition asking 
county authorities to allow the city to break away from the Los Angeles and 
Compton school systems and form its own district. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the Carson Unified School District Formation Committee say more 
than 100 volunteers are working to collect signatures.The independent district 
would include Carson High School, three middle schools and 14 elementary 
schools within city boundaries, except Compton's Ralph Bunche Elementary 
School, which serves Compton students primarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Office of Education authorized the group earlier this month to 
collect signatures after reviewing its list of reasons for creating a separate 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say an independent district would allow local control of 
educational standards, more responsiveness to local needs and a fairer 
allocation of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth of the 40,427 registered voters in Carson must sign the committee's 
petition to continue the lengthy process, which includes public hearings, 
reviews by state education officials and a referendum. Carolyn L. Harris, a 
committee leader, said the group hopes to collect more than enough signatures 
by mid-December. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: THE REGION; WILDLIFE 'SWAT UNIT' IN PLANNING STAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be organized like a SWAT team. But rather than being armed with 
high-powered rifles and special ammunition, members of this team would have 
tranquilizer guns and years of animal expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of various animal organizations in Los Angeles County are discussing 
the formation of a countywide wildlife response program, at the core of which 
would be a "wildlife SWAT unit" -- a team of animal experts that could be 
activated to respond to a wildlife emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Motivated by a May 20 incident in Azusa in which police officers shot and 
killed a 350-pound California black bear that roamed through city streets, 
members of the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals/Southern California Humane Society, the Wildlife Waystation and other 
groups are advocating the formation of a uniform policy that could be followed 
by law enforcement and humane agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's feasible," said Madeline Bernstein, executive director of the 
Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, Bernstein said, team members -- biologists, zoo veterinarians and 
other animal experts -- would be residents of varied geographic areas. 
Advocates of the plan are working to identify team members and locate heliport 
pads that would transport the team to emergency sites. The policy would give 
specific tasks to all members at an emergency scene.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; RUNNER, 49, URGES WOMEN TO STAY ON THE FAST TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORENZA MUNOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bonnie Frankel, the 49-year-old collegiate swimmer and runner who successfully 
challenged the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s athletic eligibility rules, 
is taking her story to the lecture circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel, a self-described "older adolescent," has quite a story to tell. She 
has overcome breast cancer, divorce, the pain of her mother's suicide -- and 
successfully challenged the NCAA, winning the right to compete for Division I 
college swimming and track teams in midlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lectures, the first of which she plans to deliver today at Santa Monica 
Community College, are intended to expose women to the benefits of sport in a 
time of changing lifestyles and attitudes. She is also planning lectures at 
other colleges and at conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to change traditional rules," said Frankel, now a track coach at 
Santa Monica High School. "Women say, 'I don't like sports,' but what is 
running? It's a fast dance! Sport can be used to center oneself, to challenge 
fears and deal with this obsession with weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Her first talk, "Running Through Your Midlife Crisis," deals with the 
importance of sport to enhance the body and focus the mind. Her target audience 
is women over 30 who are returning to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see women challenge themselves and do different things," said 
Frankel, who is 5-foot-1 and weighs 96 pounds. "If you do a sport, you are 
using your body in a different way. You use your mind in a different way. It 
releases energy and creativity." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel's own life has been a series of challenges. Growing up in Los Angeles 
in a well-to-do family, she saw her mother fight depression only to commit 
suicide a few years later. Frankel then married a prominent Los Angeles 
gynecologist, but soon divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 Her toughest challenge, she says, came when she was diagnosed with breast 
cancer at age 32. She underwent a mastectomy and several subsequent surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1989, she enrolled at Santa Monica Community College and found what 
she calls her salvation -- athletic competition. She was spotted by former 
Olympic gold medalist Tommie Smith, a coach at the college, and at 46 began 
training for the track team. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, she transferred to Loyola Marymount University where she 
faced her first obstacle from the athletic association. The NCAA had a 
five-year eligibility clause for returning student-athletes, which meant that 
Frankel -- because she had attended Santa Monica College in 1962 for one 
semester -- lost her eligibility to compete for a Division I school in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel challenged the NCAA ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt uncertain (about challenging the NCAA) because I knew their rule 
was wrong," she said. In her challenge, Frankel argued that she should not have 
been subject to the NCAA eligibility rule because, at the time she enrolled at 
Santa Monica College, the college did not have an inter-collegiate sports 
program for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel won. In a unanimous decision, the rules committee voted to include the 
"Bonnie Clause," which waives the five-year eligibility rule for women athletes 
who attended college before 1982 -- the year the NCAA took charge of women's 
athletics.  
</P>
<P>
 One year later, Frankel is preparing for her next challenge: She hopes to 
qualify for the 1996 Olympic trials in track and field and hopes to set a world 
record for her age group in the 800 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 She does not seem too concerned with her odds, though at 51 she would be the 
oldest competitor at the trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Human potential has no limits," she said. "Once people drop the psychological 
crap (mental blocks), the possibilities are boundless." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Frankel will give her lecture at 11 a.m. today, in Room 152 of the 
Santa Monica College Physical Education Building, 1900 Pico Blvd. Information: 
(310) 450-5150, Ext. 9850.

COMMUNITY NEWS: ALHAMBRA; THOMAS PEDRINI JR., LOCAL MUSICIAN, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Funeral services were held earlier this month for a veteran Alhambra musician 
whose family business helped foster the talents of thousands of Southern 
California entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Domenick Pedrini Jr. took over the family's music business in 1968 from 
his father, the late Thomas Domenick Pedrini Sr., who opened the first Pedrini 
Music store in Alhambra in 1938.Family members now own and operate six stores 
in Alhambra, Glendale, Orange County, San Bernardino County and in Laughlin, 
Nev. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Pedrini Jr. died Aug. 30, on the eve of his 71st birthday, of 
complications related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly called Lou 
Gehrig's disease, said his daughter Michele Monique Pedrini of Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedrini Jr. and his wife of 52 years, Geraldine, were regular performers 
during the 1970s and 1980s at Woody & Eddy's, a San Marino nightclub, and at 
country clubs in Irvine. He also had roles as an accordion and piano player in 
several movies, including "An Affair to Remember" (1957). 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Los Angeles on Aug. 31, 1923, Pedrini grew up in Lincoln Heights and 
attended Lincoln High School and UCLA, where he played football. He was a 
lieutenant with the U.S. Navy during World War II and served as a navigational 
instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his daughter Michele, survivors include his wife, son Thomas D. 
Pedrini III, two other daughters, Vicki Lynne Pedrini of Laguna Beach and 
Leslie Lee Pedrini of Alhambra, two sisters, a brother and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Services were held at Church of Our Savior in San Gabriel followed by burial 
at San Gabriel Cemetery. Family members request that any remembrances be made 
in Pedrini's memory to Forbes North ALS Research Center, California Pacific 
Medical Building, 3698 California St., fifth floor, San Francisco, 94118.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; INLAND EXPOSURE; SOMETHING MUSICAL IS 
HAPPENING IN THE POMONA VALLEY. IT'S 'ROOTSY,' INDIGENOUS, ACOUSTIC-BASED AND 
SURE SOUNDS GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Claremont is only an hour east of Los Angeles, but it might as well be light 
years away in outlook, in the way a regional sensibility takes hold once you 
leave the coast and head inland on Interstate 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it comes from living on the edge of the desert and in the shadow of 
Mount Baldy, where there are still open spaces that draw independent spirits, 
eccentrics and those who revere nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's the critical mass of smart people who are drawn by the prestigious 
Claremont Colleges and wind up settling in a town that retains its aura of old 
California, with its orange groves and Craftsman houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Dust Bowl migrants had a hand in it, settling in nearby Fontana to 
work the steel mills, bringing Midwest traditions and music. Or perhaps it was 
the African Americans who drifted into Pomona after the Watts riots and began 
weaving their own multi-textured community. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has a pet theory, but no one disputes that Claremont has become the 
hub for a "rootsy" and unique music scene in the Pomona Valley, one that 
flourishes quietly amid two generations of skilled musicians and is beginning 
to draw notice from the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something different that happens here, indigenous music forms that 
don't come out of Hollywood or L.A.," muses Claremont musician Chris Darrow, 
struggling to capture the essence of the regional sound. "We have our own 
identity, and it's very, very deep. There's something about this place; once 
you experience it, people come here and stay. It's like heroin." 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to bracket the scene, start on one end with Ben Harper, a 
24-year-old African American signed to Virgin Records who is carving a one-man 
musical niche with his hollow-neck lap slide guitar, his spiritual, rootsy 
voice and his socially conscious lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his voice evokes a Delta bluesman, Harper, who is Claremont born and 
bred, makes a point of telling people he hails from the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my home, and I'm trying to pay homage to it," Harper says simply. 
"There's so much great music coming out of the Inland Empire that deserves 
representation, and I'm honored to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Way over on the other side of experience is Darrow, a white, 50-year-old 
musician, songwriter and sage of Claremont. Darrow played in Linda Ronstadt's 
original band and on Leonard Cohen's first album, "Suzanne." He founded the 
seminal band Kaleidoscope, credited by musical historians as one of the first 
to blend country, psychedelia and rock in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a catalyst," says John Chelew, musical director of McCabe's Guitar Shop 
in Santa Monica, a venue for folk and roots music. "There are the people who 
influence the masses, and there are the sources for the people who influence 
the masses, and that's how I see Chris." 
</P>
<P>
 In between are a group of artists who draw inspiration or roots from the 
Claremont area. Mark Curry, another Virgin artist, recorded his first demo 
tapes in Claremont. David Lowery, who has an album on rotation at radio station 
KROQ, is from Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrow and music industry veteran John Van Hoven have put together an 
independent record company, Route 66, named for the historic highway that 
passes through the Pomona Valley, to focus on some of their favorite but 
little-known Inland Empire artists: Frizz Fuller, Emy Phelps, the Hershler 
Brothers, John Ware and The Fontana Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of ideas come out of here, it's just in the air," said David Lindley, a 
Claremont resident who has played with his own band El Rayo X as well as with 
Ronstadt, Jackson Browne and Ry Cooder. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Claremont resident Jack Housen, 28. After saving up for a year, 
Housen got his friends together and recorded his own acoustic CD, Two Lane 
Road, which is now getting airplay on "Morning Becomes Eclectic," the 
influential program on Santa Monica public radio station KCRW.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's so many musicians in Claremont, and everybody knows everybody," 
Housen says. "I was able to get this CD done because I had a lot of friends who 
were just into playing the music; they didn't care about the money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous older musicians associated with the country rock generation of the 
Eagles and Buffalo Springfield also make the Inland Empire home. It's almost 
incestuous: Lindley married Darrow's sister. Harper's mother once sang in a 
folk group with Darrow. Darrow bought his first guitar at the Folk Music 
Center, owned by Harper's grandparents, in downtown Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrow's home recording studio, called Studio Nadine, is the epicenter of the 
movement, a fluid group of singers, songwriters and producers supported by an 
enthusiastic musical community that favors rootsy works with an edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The dusty, eight-track studio is where Darrow performs his versions of country 
rock, bluegrass and any other stray sounds that catch his fancy. It is where 
demo tapes are made that could land aspiring young musicians record deals. 
Where people can get advice, browse among Darrow's 30-year music archives or 
just pass a lazy afternoon, drinking coffee and smoking and letting ideas 
percolate. A salon, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent summer day, singer/songwriter Eddie Cunningham was holed up in 
Studio Nadine with Darrow, working on some songs. Cunningham splits his time 
between Rancho Cucamonga and Nashville, where he writes and produces demos for 
such country superstars as Garth Brooks.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I come over here to write with Chris, it's spiritually healing for me. I 
get extra wisdom I can't have by myself," says Cunningham, whose dulcet voice 
belies his bearded face and the sleeveless denim shirt, jeans and baseball cap 
that he wears. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Seattle grunge scene that spawned Nirvana or the Minneapolis funk 
scene ignited by the artist formerly known as Prince, the Claremont scene is 
one that defies easy categorization. 
</P>
<P>
 It is based on acoustic music, with emphasis on folk music of all cultures, a 
deep respect for the human voice and profound understanding of the instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a musical Arts and Crafts Movement. 
</P>
<P>
 And Harper is one of the main apostles. 
</P>
<P>
 "His whole thing is to master the tradition, to learn the tools, learn the 
language and then you can begin to speak and write properly," says Chris 
Douridas, a DJ for KCRW who plays Harper's debut album, "Welcome to the Cruel 
World," on his "Morning Becomes Eclectic" show. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who has played with Taj Majal and recently returned from a European 
tour, credits his hometown for providing the inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's attention to detail here," he says. "It's simple music. . . . It's 
far enough from L.A. that you're not thinking about a record deal; you're just 
making pure music for the love of making music." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper got hooked while working at his grandparents' store, the Folk Music 
Center in downtown Claremont, a hands-on place with a homey feel where patrons 
are encouraged to pick up instruments and handle them. Later, he aprenticed 
himself to Howard Weissenborn, a master guitar maker, to learn how to make and 
repair string instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper played slide guitar for Darrow's neoclassic blues song "Whipping Boy." 
Released earlier this year, the record has sold 50,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrow, for one, is pleased to see Harper's success. "If one person hits, it's 
good for all of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others are more ambivalent about seeing the Inland Empire catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you do, don't call it a scene, because that will ruin it," one local 
pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear is that if word gets out, the looky-loos and the talent scouts and 
the kids hungry to latch onto something real will descend upon the Inland 
Empire and change it beyond recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very protective of their scene. They want to see it blossom, but they 
don't want it to explode and go away," says Jennifer Matthews, director of 
alternative marketing for Virgin Records, who grew up in Redlands and keeps in 
close touch with the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, they like the attention," she continues. "For a while it 
was Athens (Ga.), then Seattle. I think this is Claremont's time, and they're 
just starting to wake up to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that they've made it big. Douridas, who plays Harper, Housen and Pomona 
band Geggy Tah on his show, says that whenever he announces a band is from the 
Inland Empire, listeners call in to inquire where that is. 
</P>
<P>
 After being part of a music scene in Dallas that fizzled, Douridas came to Los 
Angeles and KCRW. He says he was initially surprised to find so much music 
coming out of the Pomona Valley area because "it just seems so sprawling and 
without a center to me." 
</P>
<P>
 But after learning more about the area, Douridas now believes Claremont has 
many of the cross-pollinating musical elements that make for success. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, there are hundreds of bright, creative people in and around Claremont 
-- professors and students from around the world who come to the six Claremont 
Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Another linchpin of the scene is Nick's Cafe, started 15 years ago by Nick 
Sandro to showcase local talent. Nick's has live music most nights and you 
never know who will drop by. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer, it was David Byrne. The former Talking Head was in 
Claremont to catch up with the Pomona band Geggy Tah, which he signed to his 
Luaka Bop label after hearing a demo tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must be something in the water," Byrne says of the Inland Empire. "Geggy 
Tah has so many deep, profound ideas in each song, in each minute of each song, 
that each song could supply a regular band with an album's worth of material 
for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that most bands expect to be discovered by Byrne or Virgin Records. And 
some are already making music on several local independent labels, including 
Shrimper Records, which is based in Upland and has put out eight compilations 
of Inland Empire bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a bunch of good bands that weren't getting anything released, and 
I had a lot of blank tape," Dennis Callaci, the 25-year-old founder of 
Shrimper, explains laconically. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the musical ferment is Rhino Records, an independent record store in 
Claremont that devotes a section to Inland Empire bands. At last count, it had 
titles by more than 100 bands in stock, according to Rob DeChaine, the store 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 DeChaine describes the Inland Empire as "a series of mini-scenes." But he adds 
that everybody knows and helps one another, unlike the cutthroat atmosphere of 
Hollywood. Often, local fans drive to Los Angeles and even San Francisco to 
lend moral support and watch their favorite Inland Empire bands play. 
</P>
<P>
 The bands also get a boost from radio station KSPC at Pomona College, whose 
avowed philosophy is to play only independent bands, including many from the 
Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 The circle comes round, unbroken, with Claremont's Folk Music Center, the 
35-year-old music store that many cite as the font of inspiration. In addition 
to a mind-expanding selection from dulcimers to ukuleles, the center has a 
small museum of instruments from around the world and holds weekly workshops. 
Next up: didjeridu lessons from a visiting Australian musician. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Kubernik, an iconoclastic record producer who started Freeway Records 
to put out spoken-word albums, makes frequent pilgrimages to Claremont and 
believes the Inland Empire is finally coming into its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot more activity . . . there than ever before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kubernik recently asked Darrow, a longtime friend, to be one of 14 artists 
contributing to a spoken-word recording called "L.A. Journal." 
</P>
<P>
 Darrow obliged with an ode to the Inland Empire that reads in part: 
</P>
<P>
 A silent sunset  
</P>
<P>
 The foothills rage  
</P>
<P>
 Coyotes sing of forgotten ways  
</P>
<P>
 Its soul lies in the chaparral  
</P>
<P>
 In amber light of fading days  
</P>
<P>
 They come to school  
</P>
<P>
 From round the world  
</P>
<P>
 They seek this different life  
</P>
<P>
 All are touched by its power force  
</P>
<P>

 RITZ AT 10: The Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point, which hosts an 
invitation-only 10th anniversary picnic bash on Sunday, is still getting those 
rave reviews. Readers of Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report, a tourist industry 
newsletter and bellwether, this month rated the place the third most desirable 
U.S. resort hotel -- just behind the Boulders in Carefree, Ariz., and the 
Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va.

 SHOP BY AIR: Having conquered South Coast Plaza, shopping mall fanatics 
looking for bigger challenges may want to consider the latest Northwest 
Airlines promotion. . . . On Saturday, the airline is flying shoppers from

Minneapolis. From the airport, passengers will be transported by bus to spend 
the day prowling the nation's largest mall, the Mall of America. Price: $129 
for a same-day round trip. "We did it last Christmas," airline spokesman Jim 
Faulkner said. "We were surprised how successful it was."

 TELEGRAPH: In evaluating campus life for students, UC Irvine Chancellor Laurel

UCLA or Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley. . . . In fact, some UCI students have 
told her that occasionally they drive north to Westwood just to "hang out," 
says Wilkening. "After all," she adds, "we are in the city of Irvine."

 COMEDY VIOLATIONS: Traffic schools long ago began introducing comedy to their 
otherwise dry venues. Now comes a twist: a comedy club that has introduced 
traffic school. Faced with only break-even crowds on Mondays and Tuesdays, the 
Improv recently turned its Brea comedy club into a laugh-oriented traffic 
school on those nights. . . . "We've been bringing more people in, probably 
because we provide a fun environment," says regional manager Robert Hartmann.

SEARCH IN SIMPSON CASE UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The detective in charge of the O.J. Simpson double-murder investigation 
recklessly misstated facts to get a search warrant, but the situation at 
Simpson's estate was suspicious enough to justify a search anyway, a judge 
ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot make a finding that this was merely negligent," Superior Court Judge 
Lance A. Ito said of the statements made by Detective Philip L. Vannatter in a 
search warrant affidavit. "I have to make a finding that this was at least 
reckless." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge noted Vannatter, seeking permission to conduct the search the 
morning after the slayings, wrongly stated: 
</P>
<P>
 * Simpson had left unexpectedly for Chicago on the night of the killings when, 
in fact, the business trip was long-planned. 
</P>
<P>
 * Failed to note that Simpson returned to Los Angeles voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 * Described stains and drops found at the house as blood or human blood 
instead of saying that they only appeared to be blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said the veteran detective had investigated enough murder cases and 
handled enough searches to know better than to make that many misstatements in 
a search warrant affidavit, which is drafted to persuade a magistrate to 
approve a search. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems, the judge upheld the search, saying the presence of what 
appeared to be blood at the estate coupled with the discovery of a glove -- 
that matched one at the murder scene -- behind a guest house provided probable 
cause for the search inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence seized in that search included blood in the foyer and bathroom, a 
receipt for an airline ticket and a baggage tag. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's ruling undermined part of a key defense effort to keep jurors from 
hearing about much of the evidence gathered inside Simpson's $5-million 
Brentwood home. The defense still can try to challenge the evidence on other 
legal grounds, but the chances of success are even less. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get one shot . . . and that's it before trial," Loyola Law School 
professor Stan Goldman said. "Sure, you come up with new evidence and you might 
be able to reopen it, but that is very, very unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, 47, has pleaded innocent to murder in the June 12 slashing deaths of 
his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling came as Simpson's lawyers pressed a bid to toss out much of the 
evidence. With jury selection in the trial less than a week away, they argued 
that police concealed facts and exceeded the authority of search warrants in 
seizing everything from the bloody glove to a movie script to Simpson's 
Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Gerald F. Uelmen, who outlined the defense's challenge of seven 
searches, contended that during a June 28 search, detectives and prosecutors 
fanned out in Simpson's home and spent three hours conducting "an impermissible 
general search." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a grazing and browsing expedition in which district attorneys and 
officers were looking for whatever might help them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, they found a video from Simpson's most recent film, sat down 
with his VCR, played it and then seized it, although it was not mentioned in 
the search warrant, according to Uelmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen said they also hauled off Simpson's Bentley, although "the affidavit 
was devoid of any probable cause that there was evidence of a crime in the 
Bentley." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, he said, there were insufficient warrants for repeated searches of 
Simpson's Ford Bronco and his business office. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter was called to testify Wednesday afternoon about the June 28 search. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, downplaying the accusations of wrongdoing, 
instead focused on procedural deficiencies in the defense challenges. She 
maintained that because the defense had failed to file the proper affidavits, 
the judge could not rule on the matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers also sought an encore witness stand appearance by Detective 
Mark Fuhrman, who the defense contends is a racist. Fuhrman found the glove 
behind Simpson's guest house that matched one at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Fuhrman's representatives fought back, alleging at a news 
conference that the woman who told the Simpson camp that Fuhrman made racist 
remarks was mad at Fuhrman because he spurned her romantic advances when they 
had a chance encounter at a Marine Corps recruiting office. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman's private investigator, Anthony Pellicano, also said three Marines who 
worked in the office denied that Fuhrman made the remarks attributed to him by 
Kathleen Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's attorney, Taylor Daigneault of Torrance, said he couldn't comment until 
he had contacted his client. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, Simpson's mother told CBS news that she is praying for 
a miracle to save her son because he already has been convicted in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Eunice Simpson and Simpson's sister, Shirley Baker, are to appear on "Eye to 
Eye" with Connie Chung on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's mother said she went to her son's home after finding out about the 
killings and found him in a state of shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I squeezed his hand, and I said, 'O.J., why would they, you know, think of 
you?' And he just squeezed my hand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't say anything?" Chung asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He appeared to be in shock," his mother replied.

ARTHUR B. KRIM; INFLUENTIAL MOVIE INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arthur B. Krim, a film executive and financier who befriended and influenced 
such dissimilar Americans as John F. Kennedy and Woody Allen, died Wednesday in 
his New York City home at 84. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said the former chairman of United Artists and founder of Orion 
Pictures Corp. had been in failing health since heart surgery last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1990 book "The Power and the Glitter: The Hollywood Washington 
Connection," Los Angeles Times political correspondent Ronald Brownstein noted 
that it was common to say that if MCA's Lew Wasserman wasn't the smartest man 
in Hollywood, Arthur Krim was. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York the order probably would have been reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Physically, the two men had little in common, but mentally they shared a 
toughness and a commitment to profits and Democratic politics. 
</P>
<P>
 They helped raise $10 million for Lyndon Johnson's 1964 skewering of Barry 
Goldwater, and Krim was instrumental in setting up a President's Club for 
Kennedy where the President had access to funds to help friendly congressmen in 
their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after learning of Krim's death, Wasserman said simply that he was 
"grieving for the loss of an old, dear friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides politics and films, Krim was deeply involved in the battle against 
AIDS. His wife Mathilde is founding chairwoman of the American Foundation for 
AIDS Research (AMFAR). 
</P>
<P>
 In an industry often criticized for the divisiveness among talent and 
management, Krim was noted at Orion for his support of such long-shot projects 
as "Amadeus" and "Platoon." 
</P>
<P>
 But by late 1991, despite the successes of "Dances With Wolves" and "The 
Silence of the Lambs," Orion had been forced by debt to cut back 250 of its 400 
employees. The distributor owed millions of dollars and had filed for 
bankruptcy. Krim was released from his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the company had incurred nearly all its debt before its later 
triumphs, and the revenue that "Lambs" and "Wolves" generated was too little 
and too late. It also was said that the company had been undercapitalized from 
its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 Krim's innovative management techniques first became obvious in the early 
1950s when he and another shrewd young lawyer, Robert Benjamin, began 
attracting independent producers to the troubled United Artists Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 They lacked production facilities but instead offered financing and allowed 
producers to retain ownership of their pictures. In return the producers 
deferred much of their fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of that mutually attractive arrangement came "The African Queen" and "High 
Noon," among other film classics, and UA returned to a prominence that it 
hadn't enjoyed in many years. Some maintained that it became the best showcase 
for talent since Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin and others started the studio 
after World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1966 Krim, Wasserman, Jack Warner and other studio chiefs hired Jack 
Valenti to advance their common interests as president of the Motion Picture 
Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 But a dozen years later, in a dispute with Transamerica Corp., which owned UA, 
Krim and his management team moved on. 
</P>
<P>
 Krim started Orion, and to his new studio came one of his old friends and best 
customers at United Artists -- Woody Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Allen's most successful pictures were distributed by Orion, which 
followed the pattern that Krim had established at UA -- leave the talent alone. 
</P>
<P>
 For UA Allen had done what many consider his signature films -- "Manhattan" 
and "Annie Hall." For Orion his string of successes continued with "Crimes and 
Misdemeanors," "Radio Days," "Hannah and Her Sisters," "The Purple Rose of 
Cairo" and others. 
</P>
<P>
 After he left Orion, Krim became counsel to the prestigious New York law firm 
of Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon. 
</P>
<P>
 Before UA and Orion, Krim had headed Eagle-Lion Film Corp., a subsidiary of 
Pathe Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, Krim had been an active alumnus and chairman of the Board of 
Trustees of Columbia University and Columbia Law School, where he graduated 
with honors in 1932. He was active in the civil rights movement, a member of 
the board of Occidental Petroleum Corp. and an intimate of its chairman, Armand 
Hammer, and a director of the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, Brownstein wrote that the low-key executive was a man of 
"impregnable discretion." 
</P>
<P>
 He also quoted an industry source as saying, "You would never know from seeing 
Arthur Krim the amount of wealth he had or power or people that he knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his wife, Krim is survived by a daughter, Daphna, and two 
grandchildren.

IRIS ADRIAN, ACTRESS WHO PLAYED 'TOUGHS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Iris Adrian, the wisecracking, gum-snapping gun moll or comic who portrayed 
what she said were "tough broads who were never mean" in dozens of films, has 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Kappler, a longtime friend, said that the brassy blonde veteran of 150 
generally low-budget pictures, whose last appearances were in such Disney films 
as "The Love Bug" and "Herbie Goes Bananas," was 82. 
</P>
<P>
 Kappler said she had died in her Hollywood Hills home of complications of 
injuries she suffered during the Northridge earthquake in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Married for nearly 30 years to former football star Ray (Fido) Murphy, Miss 
Adrian enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle thanks to shrewd investments she had 
made in real estate over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewers delighted in the candor she maintained into her last decade. She 
once told author Richard Lamparski that "I never went with actors. Basically 
they're bums who got lucky in the looks department. Vain, vain. It would be 
like dating another dame." 
</P>
<P>
 She was raised in Los Angeles and forced to quit school after her father died 
during the post-World War I flu epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 She entered beauty contests, won several and became a chorine in a local 
musical revue. 
</P>
<P>
 She toured with the Fred Waring shows of the early 1930s and was signed for 
the Ziegfeld Follies of 1931. 
</P>
<P>
 She returned to Los Angeles and began developing her trademark wisecracking 
character for skits at Nils T. Granlund's nightclubs in Hollywood, she told 
Lamparski.

PANEL DELAYS VOTE ON JOINT USE OF NAVAL AIRSTRIP; POINT MUGU: A NEW REPORT SAYS 
FACILITY COULD HANDLE COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY FLIGHTS. BUT COMMITTEE SAYS IT 
NEEDS MORE TIME TO STUDY. 
</P>

 A committee studying the mixing of military and commercial flights at the 
Point Mugu airstrip refused Wednesday to declare such use feasible even though 
a new study found that the facility could handle 42,000 jetliner flights a year 
and still meet federal smog standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn, who wants to set up jet airline 
service on the base's runway, called for immediate support of the concept of 
both civilian and Navy flights out of Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Point Mugu Airfield Joint Use Investigative Committee delayed a vote 
because the new study was delivered to its members only minutes before the 
start of the meeting, voting 4 to 3 to table Flynn's motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Councilwoman Charlotte Craven, over whose city the commercial 
flights would probably be routed, said a vote Wednesday would have been 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would irresponsible of us to take a vote on this before we have 
even had a chance to read the results of the study," Craven said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk agreed, saying she would prefer the committee 
delay any decisions on the proposed airstrip's feasibility until later this 
year, when the Southern California Assn. of Governments delivers a final study 
on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 That report is expected to detail the interest of air carrier and air cargo 
companies in using the facility, and analyze its environmental impact, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am extremely uncomfortable with the idea of this committee voting on the 
feasibility until we get all the information," VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flynn, who believes the facility would be a boon for the county, said the 
committee has enough information to declare the plan feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been meeting for more than a year on this," Flynn said. "There is 
ample evidence that this proposal can work. We should not delay in making up 
our minds. This is one of the decisions that we have been charged to make." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The latest SCAG study found that a commercial operation at Point Mugu could 
handle as many as 2 million passengers annually and still meet tough federal 
air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of where to locate the civilian terminal near the 11,000-foot-long 
runway without impacting Navy operations or violating safety procedures for 
military aircraft can be resolved, Tim Merwin, SCAG's chief aviation analyst, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, our message is that we don't think there are any fatal flaws in 
the development of a joint civilian-military use of this facility," Merwin 
said. "Over the last several months I believe we have discovered all the major 
deal-stopping problems that there are to discover." 
</P>
<P>
 Merwin said the new airport could meet 65% to 85% of the county's demand for 
air travel through 2010 -- while satisfying federal smog standards -- through 
the strict use of modern, efficient jets. A projected reduction in vehicle 
miles driven by county motorists and fewer military flights would also help 
reduce smog levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo residents' concerns about safety and noise from flights over the 
city would be minimized by the use of jetliners with ultra-quiet engines and 
satellite-operated navigational aides, SCAG officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting's end, however, many Camarillo residents said they still oppose 
the plan.

COUNTY SAYS OXNARD CANNOT ANNEX HARBOR; WATERWAY: MOVING IT INTO ANOTHER 
JURISDICTION WOULD REQUIRE TAX CONCESSIONS, LAWYERS SAY, AND BREAK A 1963 
AGREEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard's plan to annex Channel Islands Harbor is illegal, lawyers for Ventura 
County contend in a two-pronged counterattack aimed at keeping the tax-rich 
waterway in county jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter Tuesday to a state agency that presides over annexations, County 
Counsel James L. McBride argues that a technicality regarding the transfer of 
property taxes between Oxnard and the county should indefinitely sideline the 
city's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 McBride said in an interview that the county will also argue -- in a lawsuit 
if necessary -- that the harbor annexation would breach a 1963 pact between 
Oxnard and the county that states that the city would never annex the waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you sign agreements, they stick, no matter how old they are," McBride 
said. "China has been trying to take Hong Kong back for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The county would have to agree to transfer its claim on property taxes to the 
city before the Local Agency Formation Commission could make a decision on 
Oxnard's request, McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such negotiations could take years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAFCO board is set to review the annexation in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Eisner, executive director of LAFCO, said his agency's attorneys are 
examining the county counsel's claims to determine whether they are valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig said he had not yet researched the county's 
arguments and was not prepared to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll give Jim McBride some credit for creative thinking, that's for sure," 
Gillig said. "This is not a bombshell, but it's unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 Former LAFCO director Bob Braitman, hired by Oxnard to steer the plan through 
the agency, also declined comment because he had not heard of the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor John K. Flynn, who has vowed that Oxnard's plan will happen 
only over his dead body, said if McBride is right, the county has squelched the 
city's maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be impossible for Oxnard to proceed with the annexation," Flynn said. 
"(A tax agreement) would take 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1965, county-owned Channel Islands Harbor covers more than 300 acres 
of land and water. The county leases most of the surrounding land to 
developers, who have built restaurants, condominiums and about 3,600 boat 
slips.  
</P>
<P>
 Leases and taxes at the marina generate about $2 million for the county each 
year. But the waterway tussle between Oxnard and the county involves less than 
$200,000 in annual property tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard leaders say the Y-shaped waterway should be in their jurisdiction 
because it has benefited for years from city fire and police services, and is 
reachable only by city roads. The City Council voted last month to annex the 
waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But county leaders say the small-craft marina, which cost them $1 million to 
dig and $7 million to renovate, is a valuable investment they will fight to 
protect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues are much bigger than working out an agreement for taxes," McBride 
said. "The issues are whether there can really be an annexation of that water 
without the approval of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard Kapuscik, general manager of the adjacent Channel Islands Beach 
Services District, said his attorneys have determined independently that the 
tax technicality could delay the annexation indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Kapuscik and other leaders of the beach district -- which includes Silver 
Strand, Hollywood-by-the-Sea and Hollywood beaches -- say the annexation is 
only the beginning of an Oxnard ploy to take the district over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that the city's long-term game plan is to surround the beach 
district and annex the area," Kapuscik said.

WOMEN COPE WITH ANXIETY LEFT BY SERIAL RAPIST; OJAI VALLEY RESIDENTS VIGILANT, 
ANGRY AS CALLS, RUMORS FLOOD POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 From the winding, country lanes to the downtown arcade, it is difficult to 
miss the impact a suspected serial rapist has had on the normally placid Ojai 
Valley in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A composite drawing of the man's bearded face hangs in shop windows. Hundreds 
of flyers announce a community "Speak Out" for women to express their fear and 
anger. And everywhere locals gather -- from the bakery to the post office -- 
the four attacks on middle-age to older women are likely to come up in 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the fact that there could be someone who is stalking us and the fact 
that we're a targeted age group, that's the most disturbing part," Ojai City 
Councilwoman Nina Shelley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've received a number of calls from various women in the area. . . . They 
ran all the way from very deep concern to being absolutely terrified," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, more than 200 Ojai Valley residents, almost all women, gathered 
in a town hall-style meeting for a status report from Ventura County sheriff's 
detectives in charge of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowding into a school district auditorium, the residents listened to a 
chronology of the attacks, an overview of the investigation and advice on how 
to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Larry Robertson, who supervises the sheriff's major crimes unit, told the 
crowd that 161 potential suspects have been identified and ruled out. And 
dozens of deputies spent more than 400 hours canvassing Meiners Oaks two weeks 
ago. Three of the assaults have occurred in that area, and detectives have 
theorized that the rapist might live there. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the assaults, Robertson said, has prompted an explosion in calls to 
the Sheriff's Department and spawned dozens of false rumors about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Sept. 2, when the two most recent attacks occurred, the Ojai Sheriff's 
Substation has received 69 reports of suspicious subjects, 18 calls about 
prowlers and 11 other reports of suspicious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously there's a higher level of awareness," Robertson said before the 
meeting. "I wouldn't even be surprised if some of the calls were on undercover 
officers in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 In every attack, the assailant wore a nylon stocking mask and struck on a 
Friday or Saturday. He has been described as a soft-spoken man in his mid-20s 
with olive skin, auburn hair and fingers that smell of cigarettes. Victims said 
his manner was apologetic but determined. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's meeting, sheriff's officials also revealed that the suspect cut 
one woman's telephone line, looks for homes with unlocked doors or windows and 
may stalk his victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may have sat watching for periods of time," Robertson said. "I think 
predator , perhaps, is a good word." 
</P>
<P>
 Several women who attended the meeting said they have taken extra precautions 
because the suspect appears to target women who live alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've cut down my hedges, I've uprooted a tree and I've installed motion 
lights," said a 77-year-old Ojai woman who did not want to be identified. "I'm 
just very, very careful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks began March 13 when a 44-year-old woman was raped about 3 a.m. in 
her house on Pueblo Avenue in Meiners Oaks. On April 16, a 61-year-old woman 
was badly beaten as she fought off a man who entered her home on Carillo Road 
in Ojai about 1:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 After that foiled attack -- the only one in which the victim strongly resisted 
-- no other incidents were reported for almost five months. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Sept. 2, a man matching the same description assaulted a 64-year-old 
woman before dawn in her home on Taormina Lane in west Ojai. The woman escaped 
after about 45 minutes by jumping out a window and screaming for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, a 54-year-old woman was attacked at the east end of town in her 
house on El Jina Lane. The suspect brandished a small knife -- the only time a 
weapon has been seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides having a physical description, the Sheriff's Department has also 
developed a psychological profile of the suspect as a loner who was possibly a 
dropout or underachiever in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura psychologist Katherine Emerick, who sometimes evaluates alleged 
rapists for the Ventura County courts, speculated that the suspect's fixation 
with older women and his apologetic demeanor may stem from abuse he suffered as 
a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapists' "choice of acting out has to do with what they've experienced in 
their own lives and with their own families," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the concentration of attacks in Ojai, Emerick also said the 
assailant probably lives in the area, and may even know his victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably grew up there. He probably knows the town," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For some women in Ojai, it is hard to accept the notion that one man could 
make them feel uneasy in their own homes or force them to lock their doors and 
windows for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Shelley said she knows of some older women who now keep a hammer, 
knife or heavy object next to their beds at night. But some are looking for 
other ways to cope. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, a community forum will be held Friday night, giving women a 
chance to "create sacred space, tell our stories and collectively nurture our 
whole selves," a flyer reads. Participants are encouraged to bring drums to 
express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a panel discussion on self-defense is being organized for next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Said organizer and psychologist Robin Posyn: "I think we need to figure out 
what we can do . . . other than locking ourselves in the house."

 ROSSMOOR 
</P>
<P>
 Work Underway at Rush Park 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Rush Park 
</P>
<P>
 Background: In 1991, the Rossmoor Community Services District bought the 
vacant Rush Elementary School for $4.2 million in hopes of converting the 8 1/2 
acres into a park. The sale was delayed for two years when a resident 
challenged in court the district's decision to sell bonds worth $5 million to 
pay for the site. The case reached the state Supreme Court, which ruled last 
year that the district could impose an annual $109 special tax on Rossmoor 
property owners to fund the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: Work has begun to convert the school into a park. Officials of 
the district hired a construction firm last September to plant trees, remove a 
chain-link fence, asphalt and old baseball backstops and install a new 
irrigation system. The auditorium and office building of the old school have 
been kept, but three classrooms and the kindergarten building will be 
demolished. However, with just a little more than $300,000 left from the bond 
sale, officials said, other planned improvements to the park might have to be 
delayed.

 LA HABRA 
</P>
<P>
 Mary's Home Stalled by Traffic Problem 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Mary's Home in La Habra 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Approval was given last year for construction of the temporary 
shelter for the homeless and for struggling families at a location behind Our 
Lady of Guadalupe Church. But the approval did not come without some 
conditions. One was that Mary's Home must find a way to reduce traffic in the 
neighborhood before beginning to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: The traffic condition has been hard to comply with and is holding 
up construction. The shelter was scheduled to open earlier this year but Mary's 
Home officials said they don't know if it will ever be built.

 LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Middle School Might Be Reopened 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Oak Middle School 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Last year, trustees of the Los Alamitos Unified School District 
designated the 23-acre school site as surplus property that may be sold or 
leased to a developer to pay for proposed improvements to district schools. Oak 
Middle School has been closed since 1986, but part of its campus is used by the 
Orange County High School of the Arts. Some parents oppose selling or leasing 
the school site. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: The school board is now considering reopening Oak Middle School 
to accommodate the school district's growing number of sixth-, seventh- and 
eighth-grade students. McAuliffe Middle School, the district's only middle 
school, now has more than 1,600 students. The problem is where to get the 
estimated $3.3 million needed to renovate Oak Middle School.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT WILL BE CONDUCTED 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department will conduct a sobriety checkpoint Friday night and 
early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoint is one in a series planned in seven South County cities, which 
are sharing a $377,620 grant from the state Office of Traffic Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the grant, sobriety checkpoints will be held through Dec. 31, 1995, in 
Mission Viejo, Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, San Juan Capistrano, 
Dana Point and San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the seven cities will contribute $18,000 toward the program, which 
includes roving patrols by specially assigned deputies whose only task is to 
arrest drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since those patrols began Jan. 1, the number of drunk driving arrests has 
risen in the seven cities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night's sobriety checkpoint in San Clemente -- the first under the 
program -- will be from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. at an undisclosed location. JEFF BEAN

 A benefit concert and an outdoor recreational camp will be held this weekend 
by two Orange County organizations that serve AIDS patients and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Making a Difference" folk music concert will be at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at 
Orange Coast Unitarian Universalist church in Costa Mesa. Proceeds will support 
the AIDS Team Ministry, which delivers meals to home-bound AIDS patients. The 
program is operated by Orange Coast Unitarian and the Metropolitan Community 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert will feature local musician Guy Richard, who plays the piano and 
the guitar. Also appearing will be Tom Sanders, Barbara McGraw, and Canton and 
Rhiannon Clannach. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $10 and can be purchased by calling (714) 646-4652, (714) 548-2955 
or (714) 646-4213. They may also be purchased at Orange Coast Unitarian, 1259 
Victoria St. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based AIDS Services Foundation of Orange County will hold its first 
family camp Friday to Sunday at Camp Arbolado in the San Bernardino Mountains 
near Running Springs. There is no admission charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp is open to those who have a family member found to have AIDS or a 
HIV-related disease. Bilingual staff members and volunteers can accommodate 
Spanish-speaking families. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Fleming, the foundation's director of social services, said the camp may 
hold the greatest benefit for the "forgotten" people in the AIDS epidemic -- 
children whose parents are found to have the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids do not have a normal childhood," Fleming said. "Some of them end 
up taking care of their parents, making sure they take the proper medicine, and 
in effect, they become the care giver. They end up losing part of their 
childhood in the process of taking care of Mom or Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The camp is about letting them be kids again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional information on the family camp is available from the foundation at 
(714) 253-1500. ALAN EYERLY

 The Children's Bureau of Southern California will hold the first-ever Mighty 
Rubber Ducky Derby this weekend at the Wild Rivers water park in Irvine. 
Proceeds will benefit abused children in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20,000 small rubber ducks will be released into the amusement park's

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CHARGES COULD FALL AFTER EAVESDROPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reviving a sensitive issue for prosecutors, a state appeals court Wednesday 
indicated that it is considering dismissing charges against a Ventura burglary 
defendant because a deputy district attorney eavesdropped on one of his private 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Ventura County rejected a motion to drop charges against 30-year-old 
Robert Lee Morrow because Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy Ratner and another member of 
the prosecutor's office had eavesdropped on a conversation between the 
defendant and his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ventura-based 2nd District Court of Appeal ordered prosecutors on 
Wednesday to attend an upcoming hearing on the matter and provide a reason why 
the appeals court should not dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really want to say something about this case," said Deputy Public 
Defender Christina Briles, who specializes in writs and appeals. "They want to 
issue an opinion about what happened and how they feel it should be handled, 
and this is the opportunity to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow is accused of breaking into a Port Hueneme motel last September. The 
eavesdropping occurred when Morrow was talking with his attorney, Deputy Public 
Defender Mary Fielder, in a holding cell adjacent to a county courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee acknowledged that it is unusual for 
the appeals court to order prosecutors to appear at a hearing before issuing a 
ruling. But, he said, prosecutors are not surprised by the command. "It was an 
unusual case," McGee said of the eavesdropping allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office filed an appeal soon after Superior Court Judge 
Charles W. Campbell Jr. rejected a motion to dismiss the charges against 
Morrow, who is being held at the Ventura County Jail. Until a decision in the 
matter is reached, the appeals court ordered Campbell not to proceed with 
Morrow's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner has been transferred from felony prosecutions to the child-support 
unit. The second district attorney's office employee involved in the 
eavesdropping, investigator Katherine Smith, has not been reassigned. DWAYNE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL OKS $15,030 TO HELP SAVE 
BASES

<P>
 Although their constituents live far from the county's two Navy bases, 
Thousand Oaks council members have agreed to contribute $15,030 to a task force 
lobbying to keep Port Hueneme and Point Mugu open. 
</P>
<P>
 The money allocated Tuesday night will help fund the effort to persuade 
federal officials to keep the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port 
Hueneme and the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station off a list of bases 
targeted for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 The group aims to collect $350,000 from local businesses and city governments 
and hire a Washington lobbyist. So far, only the Port Hueneme City Council has 
refused the task force's plea for a contribution.  
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Oxnard, Ventura, Camarillo and Simi Valley have all pitched in, 
and other councils will consider the issue in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can clearly see how important this particular program is to the county of 
Ventura," Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The BRAC '95 task force, named for the federal Base Realignment and Closure 
Commission it plans to lobby, has earned support from local taxpayer advocates. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the few times you'll see the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn. in 
front of you, asking you to spend city money," said the group's director, Mike 
Saliba. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal commission will release its list of bases for possible closure in 
March. STEPHANIE SIMON

OXNARD MAN SENTENCED IN KILLING OF ALLEGED ACCOMPLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted Oxnard murderer was sentenced Thursday to 19 years to life for 
slaying an alleged accomplice after a grocery-store robbery, and another 11 
years for the holdup. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County Superior Court jury convicted Hector Garcia, 23, of 
second-degree murder and robbery for the Sept. 19 holdup of an Oxnard grocery 
story and the subsequent shooting death of Michael Wayne Mansir, 24, an alleged 
accomplice in the robbery, which netted $187,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Judge Charles R. McGrath handed down his sentence Thursday, Garcia 
complained about being the only one convicted in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansir was shot after someone held Garcia's wife and small daughter against 
their will at Mansir's Mandalay Bay home hours before the shooting, Garcia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to sit here and ask that my sentence get any less. That's the 
last thing on my mind," Garcia told McGrath. "I just want to know why no one 
was convicted or charged in my wife and daughter's kidnaping." 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath did not address Garcia's question during sentencing, prompting the 
defendant to ask the judge about the matter again before he was led back to 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting that that's your concern," McGrath snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe to you," Garcia shot back and promised, "I'll deal with it my way." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Mansir, the victim's 31-year-old brother, said he was not surprised by 
Garcia's testy court statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothers me, but that is in sync with Hector's personality," Mansir said 
outside court. "For him to sit there and take his punishment would have been 
totally out of character for Hector." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison denied that Garcia's wife and daughter had 
been kidnaped. He said Garcia was placing blame for his violent actions on 
others. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SEACLIFF; DEATHS BLAMED ON CARBON MONOXIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men killed in a Rincon oil field accident died from inhaling carbon 
monoxide, not hydrogen sulfide as initially believed, according to final 
toxicology results made public Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate said lab analyses showed that workers Ronald 
Johnson, Jason Hoskins and Sean Harris had high levels of carbon monoxide in 
their blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Wingate said no other toxic gases were detected by the Ventura County 
sheriff's crime lab or the Chemical Toxicology Institute in Foster City, 
Calif., both of which analyzed the samples. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred Aug. 10 as Johnson, Hoskins and Harris were working in a 
pit at the wellhead of a defunct rig near Seacliff. About noon, all three were 
overcome by fumes that caused them to go into cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other workers who pulled the men from the pit became ill from the fumes, 
but recovered after medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men who died worked for Pride Petroleum Services, which was hired by 
Tulsa-based Vintage Petroleum to work at the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas emitted from car tailpipes and 
other sources of combustion. It can reach lethal levels in enclosed spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation of the accident by state officials is not yet complete, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Vintage, Pride and a third company whose employees were 
involved have said they do not know the source of the carbon monoxide. JULIE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SCHOOLS' GROUP KICKS OFF DRIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A foundation that raises money for the Ventura Unified School District's 25 
schools kicked off its 1994-95 fund-raising drive with a goal of raising 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's Educational Foundation raised about $25,000 in the last school 
year, with contributions ranging from $5 individual gifts to corporate grants 
of more than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the money went to support the district's arts program and to award $500 
grants to about 30 teachers for classroom equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1988 to help offset the funding cuts resulting from the 1978 
Proposition 13 tax revolt, the foundation is one of the few organizations in 
Ventura County that raises money for an entire school district. 
</P>
<P>
 In most school districts, groups at individual schools raise their own money 
for classroom equipment and supplies. The amount of money raised varies widely 
among schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foundation distributes money equitably among all the schools in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to give quality education to all students regardless of incomes," 
said the foundation's executive director, Sylvia McGinnis. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's next fund-raiser is an all-day golf tournament Oct. 10 at 
Spanish Hills Golf and Country Club in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 For information on the tournament or on volunteering or donating money to the 
foundation, call McGinnis at 652-7293. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; $60,000 CHANNELED TO AID SMALL

<P>
 Small businesses in Thousand Oaks got a boost this week when council members 
decided to allocate $60,000 in federal block-grant funds to help create new 
jobs and repair existing stores. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage small-business owners to spruce up their properties, the city has 
established a $30,000 commercial rehabilitation fund to dole out low-interest 
loans and grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also spend $15,000 on a business incubator project, which 
aims to cluster several start-up environmental firms in a single office so they 
can share fax and copy machines and trade ideas. Another $15,000 grant will 
help the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. pursue ways to reduce smog 
without hurting business. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the council allocated nearly $100,000 in federal funds to build a new 
masonry wall along the east side of Moorpark Road between Columbia Road and 
Avenida de los Arboles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many segments of the wall crumbled during the Northridge earthquake, and 
residents have complained that it is both dangerous and unsightly. Completing 
the wall will take years, and could cost a total of $220,700, according to city 
staff estimates. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Searchlights will sweep the sky over Thousand Oaks on Oct. 22 to illuminate 
the grand opening celebration of the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members unanimously approved the use of sweeping arc lights from 6 
p.m. to midnight, during the black-tie gala featuring Broadway star Bernadette 
Peters and the Conejo Symphony Orchestra.The $775 cost of the lights will be 
covered mainly through ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will serve not only as a celebration for the guests that evening, but as 
an invitation to the community to come down the next day for the open house at 
the Civic Arts Plaza," grand opening planner Diana Malmquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council candidate Ekbal Quidwai spoke against the use of arc lights, arguing 
that the city should follow the rules it imposes on its residents.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure businesses in this community have tried to have grand openings with 
these lights and were turned down," Quidwai said. STEPHANIE SIMON

<P>
 An Oxnard motorist escaped a fatal gunshot wound when a bullet fired by a 
suspected gang member struck him in the side and traveled halfway up his back 
before coming to a rest just below the skin, Oxnard police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero Pardo, 19, was struck in the right side of his ribs about 7 p.m. 
Tuesday while driving west on Bard Road between Saviers Road and A Street, 
Officer Randy Gens said.He was treated and released from St. John's Regional 
Medical Center about two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet, fired by one of three teen-agers walking west on Bard, traveled up 
Pardo's right side and around to his back before stopping just under his 
shoulder, authorities said. Gens said he had ducked just before the gunman 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet, a 9-millimeter Winchester used by police service pistols, had come 
to a rest "just below the skin, where the doctor just removed it," Gens said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the suspects, none of whom were identified, fled through the back yard 
of a residence and then through E.O. Green Elementary School before 
disappearing. Gens said he suspects they are involved with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazed at the bullet's path, Cmdr. Jaimie Skeeters said, "If it was you or I, 
we'd still be lying there, probably." GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; STATE TO REPAY FINE OF $198,000 TO SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Board of Education has waived a nearly $200,000 penalty levied 
against the Ventura Unified School District for putting more elementary 
students in classes than state law allows. 
</P>
<P>
 With the waiver, state Department of Education officials said they will repay 
the district in February the full amount of the fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The state had reduced its June payment to the district by about $198,000, as a 
penalty for the district's having exceeded the state maximum of 32 students per 
elementary school class. 
</P>
<P>
 Two schools -- Will Rogers and Poinsettia -- each had a class of 33 students 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district applied to the state to waive the fine, pleading special 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 As the district argued, wide fluctuations in the number of students enrolling 
at Ventura schools in recent years has made it difficult for school officials 
to plan ahead on class size. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the district lacks the space to establish new classrooms to keep 
up with the growing number of students. 
</P>
<P>
 And some of the biggest growth is occurring at schools with bilingual 
education classes. The students who speak limited English at these schools 
could not be served adequately at other schools that may have more room. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Joseph Richards said the district will add the $198,000 
repayment from the state in February to its financial reserve. MAIA DAVIS

CITY APPROVES PLAN TO PROTECT TREES; ENVIRONMENT: THOUSAND OAKS ADOPTS PROGRAM 
TO NURTURE OAKS AND OTHER 'LANDMARK' SPECIES. PROPOSAL HAD NO OPPOSITION AT 
HEARING.

<P>
 Hoping to ensure their city will live up to its name, Thousand Oaks council 
members have adopted a tree protection plan that emphasizes nurturing oaks, 
sycamores and other varieties -- and punishing developers who illegally uproot 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plan contains some new mandates, such as requiring developers to 
plant trees along city sidewalks and pay for their maintenance, it generated no 
opposition at a public hearing Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 All five council members agreed that the program would ultimately enhance 
Thousand Oaks' community forest, keeping the city shaded, graceful and green. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be supportive of our name of Thousand Oaks well into the future," 
Councilman Frank Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The forestry program aims to protect so-called landmark trees -- sycamores, 
black walnuts, bay laurels and hollies -- in addition to the long-sacred oak. 
Removing a landmark tree, or even building close to one, will now require a 
permit, unless the tree is located in the private yard of a single-family home. 
</P>
<P>
 To further safeguard the landmark trees, described in the plan as "symbolic of 
the city's heritage, beauty and image," the forestry program calls for the city 
to launch a public education campaign. The city will also encourage local 
schools to develop a forestry curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, teachers could use the master plan's eight-page introduction, 
which asks readers to imagine a treeless city -- a hot, dry, hostile 
environment of stark concrete and barren streets. Trees, the report concludes, 
serve as "living clocks marking the passage of time" and "green monuments to 
our past." 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting admiringly on the flowery rhetoric, Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said 
Tuesday: "This certainly is a passionate report." 
</P>
<P>
 Adopted as an element to the General Plan, the forestry program lists 62 
goals, ranging from training city tree workers in horticulture to developing 
neighborhood landscape programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will also strive to plant more canopy trees along sidewalks to shade 
at least 50% of every public street. Private parking lots, too, must be heavily 
shaded, under the new city rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the council also agreed to concentrate on drought-resistant 
landscaping, replacing grassy street medians with mulch and rock gardens. The 
city's ever-escalating water costs have boosted the annual landscape 
maintenance budget to about $2.9 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all love the lush green look," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said, "but it may 
not be the most cost-effective or environmentally conscious. That doesn't mean 
we have to go to the stark, barren, Arizona desert look -- I think we can do it 
attractively." 
</P>
<P>
 While landscape architects and environmental activists stayed away from the 
public hearing Tuesday night, in private interviews they expressed doubt about 
whether the city would enforce tough tree protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can write all these reports and say all these great things, but unless 
you implement them, it's just another way of fooling people," Sierra Club 
activist Cassandra Auerbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager MaryJane Lazz, however, said the city staff could 
enforce the laws -- and in many cases, they already do. "This really just puts 
into place some of the informal policies the council has held for a long time," 
she said.

CITY DECIDES TO REDESIGN RV PROJECT; PORT HUENEME: COUNCIL WILL FOLLOW COASTAL 
PANEL'S RECOMMENDATION AND MOVE THE PROPOSED RESORT 290 FEET SO IT WON'T POSE 
DANGER TO WETLANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Trying to salvage its long-sought recreational vehicle resort, the Port 
Hueneme City Council decided Wednesday to redesign its proposed beachfront 
project so it can overcome environmental concerns of the California Coastal 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 1 to follow the Coastal Commission's recommendation to 
move the proposed RV resort 290 feet up the coast so it would not pose a danger 
to habitat on environmentally sensitive wetlands and sand dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The RV resort represents a stream of revenue that is much needed for this 
city," Mayor Orvene Carpenter told the 120 residents who packed the council 
chambers in protest of the RV park. "If we felt that there were any endangered 
species in the area, we, the city, would be the first to protect them." 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision comes a week after the Coastal Commission narrowly 
rejected a city proposal to build a 144-space resort on a city-owned beach 
about a half-mile down the coast from the municipal pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the commission concluded the resort could harm the fragile 
environment, it invited the city to resubmit its application provided that it 
relocate the project away from the fragile dunes and make other changes to 
protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Toni Young cast the lone vote against the project, arguing that 
the resort has caused enough tension in the community. She suggested that the 
decision should be left to the newly elected City Council, which will take 
office about the first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman James Daniels was absent from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Coastal Commission last week denied the city's request, the 
commission approved a compromise proposal recommended by its staff. Under that 
plan, the beachfront project could be built if moved north toward the municipal 
pier, and if the city replants the original site with native vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving the site would require city planners to redesign the entire project so 
it could fit on the new terrain, said Tom Figg, the city's community 
development director. 
</P>
<P>
 With a revised proposal, the city will need to "determine how many RVs we will 
be able to put on the new site and what revenues it (resort) will bring to the 
city," Figg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also wanted the city to allow tent campers to use the resort 
and set up a public education center to help residents and visitors appreciate 
the sensitivity of nearby endangered plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council directed city planners to prepare a new proposal with the 
education center and possibly without a provision for tents at the resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Figg said it will take about two weeks for city staff members to rework the 
project for submission. He also said that before the city reapplies to the 
Coastal Commission, the city must have a public hearing on the revamped 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, who estimated that the initial resort proposal would net 
$400,000 a year, have spent more than $500,000 on environmental and market 
studies on the project so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Dorill Wright, who sits on the Coastal Commission and is a 
supporter of the resort, urged the city to proceed now with the project to 
avoid conducting another round of environmental studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's initial proposal submitted to the Coastal Commission called for 
construction of the resort on a 10-acre beachfront site at the end of Ocean 
View Drive at Hueneme Beach Park. The project was vehemently opposed by 
environmentalists, who noted the wetland is home to the California least tern, 
an endangered bird. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has also been strongly opposed by some owners of the nearby 
375-condominium complex, who argued it would ruin their ocean views and 
property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Brigham, a spokesman for Surfside III Condominium Homeowners Assn., vowed 
to file a federal lawsuit if the Coastal Commission approves the city's new 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this project is ever approved, we will file so many lawsuits that we will 
hold up the project for at least three years," Brigham said. "City officials 
should read our lips: There is not going to be any RV park near our homes."

LANDFILL OPERATOR DROPS DUMP FROM PLAN; SIMI VALLEY: FIRM DECIDES AGAINST 
TRUCKING OCEANSIDE TRASH TO SITE NEAR CITY. LOCAL OFFICIALS EARLIER THIS MONTH 
HAD THREATENED TO STALL EFFORT. 
</P>

<P>
 Bowing to pressure from angry Ventura County leaders, Waste Management pledged 
Wednesday not to truck trash from Oceanside to its landfill near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, reached after Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard and the 
Simi Valley City Council voiced strong opposition to the plan, was announced by 
Waste Management officials at an Oceanside City Council meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have reviewed all the other options, and this one, after further review, 
doesn't make sense," Waste Management spokesman Greg Loughnane said in an 
interview. "It was apparent from the start that Simi Valley was the least 
likely alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Protests arose earlier this month when Ventura County leaders learned that 
Waste Management was considering the Simi Valley Landfill as one of four 
potential dump sites for 300 tons of trash from Oceanside each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard threatened to stall the plan by calling for a full environmental impact 
report, arguing that hauling outside trash to Simi Valley would increase air 
pollution and shorten the life of the landfill for local rubbish. 
</P>
<P>
 Oceanside Deputy City Manager Dana Whitney said the city urged Waste 
Management to drop the Simi Valley dump from the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we were concerned that there was a potential threat of challenges 
on our environmental determination," Whitney said. "We discussed it with Waste 
Management and were pleased when they made the decision. I think it was a good 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Howard also praised Waste Management's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very pleased about what has happened," Howard said Wednesday. "It 
shows that all of our lobbying efforts were not in vain." 
</P>
<P>
 Waste Management, which owns and operates the Simi Valley Landfill, announced 
plans last fall to seek trash from other counties to increase the dump's 
income. The Simi Valley dump, just northwest of the city limits, was not taking 
in enough trash to remain profitable -- a problem that continues to plague the 
dump operators. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, a Utah rail hauler outbid Waste Management for the right to handle 
Oceanside's trash. Ventura County leaders took that agreement as an assurance 
that the trash would not end up in the Simi Valley dump. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rail carrier ran into technical problems and early this summer Waste 
Management returned, offering the city a cheaper rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ventura County leaders are pleased with Wednesday's decision, they 
acknowledge that there are still problems to iron out with Waste Management 
over the operation of the Simi Valley Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The dump, which takes in about 1,000 tons of trash a day from Simi Valley and 
neighboring communities, needs an additional 400 tons each day to turn a 
profit, Loughnane said. The dump could meet that goal if Thousand Oaks trash 
now hauled to Los Angeles were rerouted to the Simi Valley Landfill, he said.

UNION REJECTS EX-CHIEF; SIMI VALLEY: PRERECORDED TELEPHONE MESSAGE DIRECTED AT 
VOTERS INSTEAD GIVES POLICE ASSOCIATION ENDORSEMENT TO TWO OTHER CANDIDATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A telephone tape message being systematically played to Simi Valley voters is 
telling them that the Simi Valley police union will not back former Police 
Chief Lindsey Paul Miller for City Council and urges voters to instead support 
two other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 A computerized phone system, rigged by the Simi Valley Police Officers Assn. 
to call city voters at home, plays the prerecorded message declaring union 
support for incumbent Sandi Webb and former Chamber of Commerce President 
Michael S. McCaffrey. 
</P>
<P>
 The recorded voice, identified by Miller as that of association President Gary 
Collins, then goes on to urge residents not to vote for Miller, claiming that 
during Miller's 13 years as chief the department suffered from management 
problems and general turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 55, defended his record as chief, pointing out that Simi is now 
recognized as one of the safest of its size in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first took over the department it had major problems," Miller said. 
"Now we have one of the finest departments in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he believed the recording was made by just a few association 
members, without support from most of the union's members. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember that this is a labor union and as chief I may have 
clashed with a few of the members over the years," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Collins and union Vice President Ron Lompart could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday. Collins did not return repeated calls to his home, and neither 
officer responded to efforts from other association members to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer John McGinty, a former board member of the association, said the 
recording does not represent the views of most officers in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "That message was put together by a select few," said McGinty, who has worked 
for the department for five years. "It was not approved by the general 
membership, and I don't think those views are shared by the general 
membership." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McGinty acknowledged that morale was low in the department during Miller's 
tenure, but he questioned whether the former chief was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this type of field, morale is going to go up and it's going to go down," 
McGinty said. "There is a tendency to point to the chief as the culprit, but 
there are many other factors to consider." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Wayne James, treasurer of the association, said he was not aware of 
the recording. When told of its content, he agreed with the sentiment it 
expressed. 
</P>
<P>
 He criticized Miller's management style as "laissez-faire," and said for the 
past several years of Miller's tenure the department was rife with internal 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception was that the City Council through the city manager ran the 
department," James said. "Miller was unable to come forth with leadership of 
his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller retired from the department in February and announced his council 
candidacy soon after. There are seven candidates in the race for two council 
seats. Early in his campaign he announced that he would not seek the 
endorsement of the police union or any other employee group, saying he wanted 
to avoid a conflict of interest.

LET'S PLAY BALL; GLAMOROUS GOWNS ARE GOING TO DRAMATIC LENGTHS TO REVIVE 
ROMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With their bejeweled bodices and voluminous taffeta skirts that make a 
pleasing rustling sound when women walk, ball gowns recall an era of Old World 
elegance. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past few years, it seemed that world had been lost. Traditional ball 
gowns were seldom seen at even the fanciest galas. Instead women wore 
pared-down, understated column dresses that seemed more appropriate for 
recessionary times. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are signs that ball gowns -- and glamour -- are making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 At formal affairs from Orange County to New York, women are once again 
dressing up like Cinderella in yards of taffeta and silk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glamour is back. It's demonstrated in red lips, red nail polish and soft 
hair," says Sandra Graham, spokeswoman for Escada USA in New York City. "That's 
where the return of the ball gown comes in. Women want to feel glamorous, 
romantic and elegant." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first year in many seasons that Graham says she doesn't feel 
self-conscious wearing a ball gown to a formal affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm seeing a lot more of them in the past six months," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 With the economic landscape improving, there are more opulent ball gowns on 
the racks -- and more people buying them -- than in several years past, says 
Dorothy Maas, corporate couture director for Nordstrom, which has stores in the 
Brea Mall, MainPlace/Santa Ana and South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ball gowns lend a certain elegance. We're getting away from last fall's drab 
looks," Maas says. "At one point everyone wanted slinky, understated looks. It 
had to do with the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The gowns come in the deep jewel tones that have been missing recently from 
fashion. There are rich hues of ruby and purple that lend themselves to wearing 
fabulous jewelry -- also primed for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Joanna Mastroianni chose deep purple for a ball gown with a satin 
over-skirt and beaded lace long-sleeved top ($4,700 at Nordstrom). For high 
glamour, Michael Casey designed a strapless ball gown that sculpts the body in 
tightly gathered iridescent turquoise taffeta; the skirt flares out 
dramatically below the hips, and the gown comes with a flowing sash ($4,700 at 
Nordstrom). 
</P>
<P>
 Some gowns have just a touch of drama: Donald Deal's simple strapless gown of 
navy satin has a touch of black lace trim on the accompanying wrap ($1,870 at 
Nordstrom). Carolina Herrera, meanwhile, made sure the wearer of her black 
velvet gown would turn heads. It has a bright red silk petal skirt attached to 
the back ($3,400 at Nordstrom). 
</P>
<P>
 Some designers have taken liberties with the basic ball gown silhouette -- 
traditionally a full skirt that poufs out with the help of petticoats and a 
fitted bodice to show off the waist. Scaasi, for instance, created an empire 
waist ball gown with a full skirt of red rose damask and a red lace 
long-sleeved top ($3,390 at Nordstrom). 
</P>
<P>
 Escada, too, has updated the classic ball gown. Some of its gowns feature 
innovations like turning the top and skirt into separates, so one can wear a 
big ball skirt with the velvet top it comes with or something different, such 
as an organza blouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's new to ball gowns. It modernizes them," Graham says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh prints, including plaids and stripes in silk and taffeta, also freshen 
up the ball gown for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 One Escada gown has a brown and gold striped taffeta skirt with a brown velvet 
jacket-style bodice ($3,000), while another has a skirt of crimson plaid 
taffeta and a black velvet attached jacket with red bow trim ($2,000). Both 
gowns are available at the Escada boutique in South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ball gowns take you back in time," Graham says. "There's a feminine influence 
in the market now. Things are flowing and soft, and ball gowns fall into that 
category." 
</P>
<P>
 Where to wear these romantic creations? In Orange County, ball gowns are not 
worn to just any old black-tie gala. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a difference between your ordinary black-tie event and one that 
requires a huge ball gown, says Gael Lauritzen, owner of 341 Bayside in Newport 
Beach. For most formal functions women prefer to wear short cocktail dresses or 
long slip gowns, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "For women today, ball gowns are for something beyond a black-tie event," 
Lauritzen says. "It takes your most dressy occasion." 
</P>
<P>
 Opera and debutante balls are among the spectacular events where ball gowns 
are the rule more than the exception. Such extra-special galas call for a 
fantasy creation such as Vera Wang's ball gown of hunter green taffeta with its 
striking portrait collar (about $3,000 at 341 Bayside). 
</P>
<P>
 "Ball gowns will always be a necessity for that most elegant of evening 
affairs," Lauritzen says.

JOHN IRVING'S PASSAGE TO INDIA . . . AND THE BIZARRE; LITERATURE: IN HIS LATEST 
WORK, THE CREATOR OF 'GARP' EXPLORES THE STRANGE REALMS OF THE CIRCUS TO TACKLE 
THEMES OF ALIENATION AND IDENTITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "I'd left the brothel and was on my way to the club," John Irving is saying, 
"when I said, 'I haven't seen the transsexuals this morning! I've got to go 
back and see the transsexuals because I want to see what they look like now as 
opposed to what they look like after they're dressed.' And we turned around to 
go back." 
</P>
<P>
 Irving is describing his visit to India, which took place more than four years 
ago, when he gathered much of the material for his novel, "A Son of the 
Circus," recently published by Random House. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the book has more plot twists than the Mahabharata and a cast of 
characters that includes dwarfs, prostitutes, movie stars, self-emasculating 
transsexuals and a serial killer, the author seems proudest of the research 
that went into it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people who look upon me as the creator of freaks and the bizarre will 
never know that all the Indian material is not invented. That there are 5,000 
Hijras in Bombay and their emasculation is done under the exact same terms I 
describe. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he boasts, "All of the circus acts are real -- including the 
cricket-playing elephants." 
</P>
<P>
 Irving is in the spacious, light-filled kitchen of his Vermont home, chopping 
vegetables for dinner. "I talk better if I'm doing something," he explains, 
attacking a zucchini with neat, strong strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 The 52-year-old writer, who supported himself as a wrestling coach for years 
before "The World According to Garp" catapulted him to literary stardom in the 
'70s, still makes an athletic impression. Dressed in red running shorts and 
sport sandals, he is deeply tanned and has the bold carriage and quick energy 
of a younger man. The bulldog pugnacity of his handsome face is softened by a 
silver mane that he sweeps back dramatically while talking. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently remarried and at one point is interrupted when he thinks he hears 
crying on the intercom and runs to check on his 3-year-old son. His manner of 
speaking is disarmingly flamboyant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you can make demands on the reader if you have the confidence that 
you have readers," he says, alluding to the rather complex opening of his vast 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers are one thing Irving certainly has. His last five novels have all been 
reviewed on the cover of the New York Times Book Review. There are more than 10 
million copies of "Garp" in print. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not always been like that. Irving's early novels sold fewer than 10,000 
copies apiece. "You develop what they call a track record," he says, "and my 
track record was that I lost money." 
</P>
<P>
 He is keenly aware of the change wrought by fame. "Right up through 'Garp' I 
used to sit around wondering who the hell's reading these books? Once I had an 
audience, I stopped thinking about it. And that became one of the great 
liberties." 
</P>
<P>
 Although grateful for the freedom fame has bestowed, Irving is touchy about 
the way critics view him now that his books are virtually born on the 
bestseller lists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recognize there's a funny transition. I write four books and whether they 
get good reviews or bad reviews, it goes without saying, in all that I'm a 
literary writer. After 'Garp,' half the reviews take the position that I'm a 
best-selling hack. Well, I don't know how these changes happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Irving seems particularly resentful of the assumption that he is merely a 
seeker of the bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come up to me at cocktail parties and say, 'You'll never guess what 
happened to my grandmother. She was backing out of the garage when her house 
fell down and her car rolled down into the pool.' If it's really stupid, they 
say it could be in one of my novels." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But when his friends Mary Ellen Mark and Martin Bell told him about the Indian 
circus, he had to admit that it did indeed sound like something that belonged 
in one of his novels. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark and Bell had been trying to make a documentary about the circus and, 
finding no funding, proposed to Irving that he write the screenplay for a 
feature film. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving had already been thinking about India. A few years before in Toronto, 
he had been sitting in the back of a taxi waiting for the light to change when 
he saw a man waiting to cross the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was much as I describe Dr. Daruwalla," Irving explains, referring to the 
hero of his novel. "Well-dressed, in his early 60s, very dignified-looking." 
The man might have been Indian, although Irving wasn't sure. What was clear was 
that as he stared, Irving realized he was making the man uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "His wariness was racial. This was a man who had suffered some verbal abuse in 
the past." Then the light changed and he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 From that moment on, the idea of a novel began vaguely to emerge. It was the 
man's alienation that worked on Irving's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, when he goes home it must not feel like home anymore. When he is 
here, how much like home does this feel?" This was something Irving frequently 
heard from Indian-born friends who urged him to write about the sidewalk 
apparition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make him an Indian but not an Indian," Irving recalls them saying. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Irving worked out many things about his hero: He would be a doctor born in 
Bombay, educated in Europe, living in Toronto. He would be a Parsee convert to 
Christianity. He would work with joint diseases of children and be a closet 
screenwriter of garish Hindi detective films. 
</P>
<P>
 But something was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 When he heard about the Indian circus, and how children were sold into it to 
save them from a life on the streets, he realized he had the final piece. Dr. 
Daruwalla's path would somehow cross the path of the Indian circus. 
</P>
<P>
 A bargain was struck. "I would go, live with the circus, write the script for 
Martin's movie -- but I would do that on the condition that I could at the same 
time make use of my friends and their friends and their friends' friends to 
work on my own story." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he did produce a screenplay as well as a novel -- the screenplay 
is cleverly inserted into the novel -- Irving has no great love of movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a movie person," he says. "They're collaborations of the worst kind. 
You must compromise yourself to many interests that are venal and crass and do 
not have your best interests at heart." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The collaborative aspect of his novel, however, fills him with gratitude. 
Irving visited India for only one month, but he was able to pack a virtual 
lifetime into it. He was met at every turn by expert Indian guides who ferried 
him around Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I set up a shopping list," he explains, recalling his list of demands: "I 
want to go to Mass at 7 o'clock in the morning. I want to go directly from Mass 
to the brothel, the same brothel I left at midnight the night before. I want to 
go to a private club. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 He is effusive in his thanks to Indian friends, who not only guided him 
through the city but acted as readers and critics of the manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't have gotten anywhere with this book if it wasn't for the help of 
these people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the New Hampshire-born writer felt daunted by the wealth of 
information about India he knew he would have to assimilate, the task of 
imagining an immigrant came naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel I really belong anywhere, either. I always feel like someone who 
just moved to town wherever I live," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving, who spends part of each year in Canada, seems to be drifting farther 
from America. His previous novel, "A Prayer for Owen Meany," includes an angry 
defense of Canadian literature against the insulting claims of an American 
professor. And the writers he lists as favorites -- Gunter Grass, Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez, Salman Rushdie -- are all practitioners of a kind of 
international novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the novel must become more international in certain ways. I don't 
think you need to be an Indian-born, European-educated man living in Canada in 
order to feel Dr. Daruwalla's kind of alienation. I think a century from now, 
many of the most sophisticated, better educated people in the world will have 
been born one place, educated in a second place and then wind up living in a 
fifth and sixth place after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Irving clearly knows a number of people who straddle multiple cultures, and 
the book is dedicated to one such friend. The dedication reads simply: "For 
Salman." 
</P>
<P>
 He explains that his introduction to Bombay came years earlier when he read 
Rushdie's "Midnight's Children" in manuscript. Rushdie had turned up at a 
reading Irving gave in London, introduced himself and handed Irving his 
unpublished book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very close to him ever since. We were having dinner together in 
Toronto when he learned that India had banned 'The Satanic Verses.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Irving says he wanted to avoid using Rushdie's name as a political tag. "The 
reason the book is for Salman and not Salman Rushdie is that if you say 'Salman 
Rushdie' now, it sounds like you're making a political statement. It becomes 
one of those political knee-jerk solidarity kind of things. . . . This book 
would always have been for Salman, with or without that damned fatwa." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Irving doesn't deny that the spirit of the post-fatwa Rushdie hovers 
over the book as well. The comic absurdity of the novel is darkened by an 
awareness of the dangers of sectarianism, of religious fanaticism and of racial 
hatred. In Irving's mind, though, it is comic absurdity itself that so rankles 
his own and Rushdie's critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe Salman would have been in trouble at all if he hadn't been 
funny," Irving says passionately, going on to say of his own work: "It's not 
the transsexuals or the penises bitten off in cars or various extravagant 
things people attach to my books that makes people angry. It's that they're 
supposed to be funny."

STORIES, TRADITIONS AND THE BABY WHITE BUFFALO; MIRACLES: THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN VISITING THE CALF BORN ON DAVE HEIDER'S WISCONSIN FARM. MANY NATIVE 
AMERICANS BELIEVE IT IS A SACRED SYMBOL. 
</P>

<P>
 There is but a hint of autumn on Dave Heider's farm in southern Wisconsin. 
Soon it will turn cool, then cold. The maple, oak and walnut trees will shed 
their leaves upon the sandy loam and hoarfrost, then become winter skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be quiet here. After a day spent working for the Rock County 
Highway Department atop roaring, heavy equipment, Heider would retreat to his 
46 acres outside Janesville. And the quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 But since Aug. 20, thousands of people, including Southern Californians, have 
been arriving for a glimpse of the white baby buffalo. On Sunday, almost 2,000 
people visited between noon and 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The white calf is a sacred symbol, a prophecy fulfilled to many Native 
Americans, particularly those of the Northern Plains who maintain traditional 
beliefs, and it has ignited a pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Funmaker, 48, is a Wisconsin Winnebago, a spiritual leader and treatment 
coordinator at the Eagle Lodge, a Long Beach substance abuse treatment center 
that utilizes Native American culture in the healing process. The story of the 
White Buffalo Calf Woman, he says, begins with two men walking on the prairie. 
(It would take days to tell the entire story, and as is the case with oral 
history, details may differ from one person to the next. The message, however, 
is the same.) 
</P>
<P>
 It was probably his grandfather who first told Funmaker the story of how she 
delivered a sacred gift to the people before vanishing into the clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two men were out one day looking for food, buffalo, in a time of hardship," 
he says. "They were out on the prairie, and they saw something approaching 
them. They thought it was a buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
 As it drew near, they saw that it took on the appearance of a beautiful woman, 
Funmaker says. One of the men had feelings of lust for the woman, while the 
other was a spiritual person who warned the other warrior that it was wrong to 
have such thoughts. "He said that what they were witnessing was sacred, but the 
other man wanted to approach the woman with those physical feelings. He 
approached her with those thoughts, and a cloud came over them, and when the 
cloud lifted, the man lay dead on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman instructed the spiritual warrior to return to his people and tell 
them what he had witnessed. She said to tell them that she was a messenger from 
the creator and would return in four days to deliver a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she returned, she was carrying a bundle and some sage. She came into the 
lodge, which had been prepared for her and came before the chiefs and headmen, 
the medicine men and spiritual leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 She opened the bundle and revealed a sacred pipe. The White Buffalo Calf Woman 
stayed four days, spending a day each with the men, the women, the children and 
the elders, instructing them on how to live virtuous lives, how to use the 
sacred pipe in ceremonies to pray to the creator. Before leaving, she told the 
people that she would return someday. 
</P>
<P>
 "As she left the village, the people watched and she transformed back into a 
buffalo," Funmaker says. "She rolled on the ground four times. Each time she 
rolled, she was a different color. The final color was white. Then she ascended 
into the clouds. That was the last time she was seen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the White Buffalo Calf Woman is not so different from those of 
other beliefs, Funmaker says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Christianity, a virgin woman gave birth to a child. That child was wrapped 
in a bundle, a gift to the people, the son of God. For us, when we unwrapped 
our bundle, it was a sacred pipe, also brought to us by a virtuous woman from 
the creator. Our path is like any other's path. It leads to the same place," 
says Funmaker, a member of the Bear Clan, who was born in his grandparents' 
two-room log home in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 While he doesn't plan on visiting the calf, his belief in the sacred pipe -- 
the words delivered from the creator by the White Buffalo Woman -- have been 
Funmaker's strength over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls his first day of school. His grandmother had braided his hair and 
dressed him in a fine vest she had made from deer hide and decorated with 
beads. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got to school, they cut my hair and took my vest off and took me down 
to the basement where they had the furnace. They opened the furnace door, and 
the teacher instructed me to take my vest and my hair and put it in the 
furnace." 
</P>
<P>
 He left home as a teen-ager and embarked on a journey, traveling all over the 
country, living on the streets. He drank too much, consumed and sold drugs. He 
did three years for assaulting a police officer in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 years ago, an elder offered him a pipe. Funmaker fasted and prayed 
and decided to take the pipe, knowing that by doing so he must live his life 
according to the teachings of the White Buffalo Woman. 
</P>
<P>
 He now runs sweat lodges for inmates, and since 1983 has worked at the Eagle 
Lodge. He says he has dedicated his life to the sacred pipe, which is kept in 
Green Grass in South Dakota, cared for by a family named Looking Horse. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the pipe, he says, that helped him heal from the alcohol, the drugs and 
the image that burns in his memory of his hair and fine vest being claimed by 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were three visions. 
</P>
<P>
 Looks for Buffalo, a revered spiritual interpreter on the Pine Ridge 
Reservation in South Dakota, says he received signs from spirits that the White 
Buffalo Calf Woman would soon return. 
</P>
<P>
 The premonitions told him that "The Lady" was coming to unite the people, and 
when he heard that a white calf had been born in Wisconsin, he began planning 
for the journey. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived at the Heider farm on Sept. 12 following four days of preparation 
in Minneapolis, where offerings from tribes all over the country were gathered. 
A purification ceremony was conducted for about 300 people chosen to take part 
in the special ceremony to honor the sacred 40-pound calf and the White Buffalo 
Calf Woman. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been other white buffalo, the most famous being Big Medicine, born 
at the National Bison Range in Montana in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 But Big Medicine had a brown crown. He had a male albino offspring that lived 
for 12 years at the National Zoological Gardens in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Looks for Buffalo, 55, has looked askance at the other white buffalo, 
believing that the sacred one would be female, entirely white (but not albino), 
and not the result of cross-breeding with cattle -- as some of the others have 
been. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," he says of the Wisconsin calf, "is the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Before traveling to Wisconsin, Looks for Buffalo had a vision that the calf's 
father would die, so that the newborn could live. He telephoned Heider and 
explained who he was and that he was told by spirits to deliver that message. 
</P>
<P>
 Heider, unfamiliar with Native American cultures, didn't know what to think of 
the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the bull died. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Heider has 13 buffalo, a llama, quarter horses, a few cattle and some 
peacocks. They are for his family's enjoyment, but since the calf named Miracle 
was born, all that has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 A person representing rocker/hunter Ted Nugent, who in 1974 recorded "Great 
White Buffalo," inquired about buying the calf. Word also arrived that actress 
Shirley MacLaine would like to see the calf. 
</P>
<P>
 Heider, 46, says the calf is not for sale and visitation has been limited to 
weekends. He doesn't quite know what to think about all the attention, about 
the medicine wheels and dream catchers and sacred bundles and eagle feathers 
being left hanging on the pasture gate. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a reason why the calf was born on his farm, according to Looks for 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was born to a white family as an omen to the white people," he says. "They 
must pay attention to what they are losing. When they want to know something, 
they ask a machine. They have lost touch with Mother Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Arvol Looking Horse, a spiritual leader and caretaker of the sacred 
pipe, visited for about five hours. He and Heider drank coffee and talked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me that every four days, I could take the items off the gate, except 
for the eagle feathers, and burn them in a fire, and that the smoke would carry 
them to the spirits," Heider says. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been quite a learning experience for Heider. Some things he can't quite 
figure out, like the telephone call from Looks for Buffalo warning him of the 
death of the bull, which had been suffering from stomach ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
 But he says he will abide by the wishes of the Native Americans. He will wait 
four days before removing sacred items. He does not wish to offend spirits he 
just recently has learned about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe," he says, "somebody up there is trying to tell us something."

ROBIN PICCONE RIDES THE NEXT WAVE; THE QUEEN OF NEOPRENE JUST CAN'T STOP 
CREATING. SHE'S DESIGNING A GUESS? LINE -- AND RUNNING HER OWN SUCCESSFULO 
FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK / LOS ANGELES TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A well-meaning, well-placed fashion photographer recently called designer 
Robin Piccone's judgment into question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically he said I was wasting my time in Los Angeles," says the woman whose 
sexy rubber bathing suits revolutionized swimwear in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking about it for a couple of days -- that maybe it was not a great 
choice for my career to stay here. But more than I've worked to achieve success 
in my life, I've worked to achieve balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Piccone's decision to remain an L.A.-based designer -- despite the lure of New 
York's Seventh Avenue -- has paid off. Since introducing neoprene to fashion 
for the Body Glove label, Piccone started her own swim and sportswear company, 
Piccone Apparel. Then, earlier this year, she signed a licensing agreement to 
design a junior swimwear collection for jeans giant Guess? 
</P>
<P>
 All that would seem to leave little time for family matters -- unless the 
family is as involved in the business as Piccone's. Her husband, Richard 
Battaglia, is national sales manager. Piccone's aunt, Linda Rosetti, tends the 
books. Her father, Robert, a retired building contractor, handled the 
renovation of the corporate headquarters in the old Culver City post office 
building. And her mother, Rita -- who negotiated the Guess? deal -- is 
Piccone's partner and chief financial officer. The whole family gathers for 
dinner/board meetings several times a week at Piccone's parents' Hancock Park 
house, which is just four blocks from her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have lived like Holly Golightly for years in New York," says Piccone 
in her tidy lime-and-white office dotted with trophies, family photos, 
sketches, clothing samples and kitschy '50s memorabilia. "It just didn't appeal 
to me after my children were born. They've become the focus and center of our 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Piccone, a 34-year-old L.A. native, brought son Maximillian, now 5, to the 
office every day of his first year. Now she takes Fridays off to be with 
2-year-old Luca. 
</P>
<P>
 Kal Ruttenstein, Bloomingdale's senior vice president for fashion direction 
and longtime Piccone fan, remembers the time Piccone and Battaglia drove from 
L.A. to New York with their firstborn for a personal appearance at the store: 
"I have a very fond spot in my heart for them. The baby slept in my office." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Piccone's devotion to her children expresses itself in the 
clothing she hand-sews for them. That the Queen of Neoprene would spend 
countless hours making a christening gown or batiste shirt would surprise only 
those who don't know that Piccone prefers cooking, sewing and antique 
collecting to swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Robin Piccone and swimwear are practically synonymous. In a Women's Wear 
Daily survey, Piccone's name ranked among the top 10 swimwear labels that 
consumers know best -- along with such giants as Jantzen, Catalina, Speedo, 
Cole and Gottex -- despite the fact that her company hasn't spent a dime on 
advertising. And when asked about his company's choice of Piccone to create the 
first swimwear line Guess? has produced in six years, president and advertising 
guru Paul Marciano says he was "waiting for the right candidate to come along." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 5, Piccone lopped off the bottom of her parents' curtains to make 
her version of a jumpsuit. Influenced by her paternal grandmother, who had 
handmade clothes for Piccone and her sister, Piccone says: "From an early age, 
I always knew I wanted to be a designer." 
</P>
<P>
 After she doodled her way through Beverly Hills High School (as an outsider 
whose mother worked for the district), she graduated Los Angeles Trade 
Technical College with honors. Her professional life commenced with "a terrible 
job" at Cole of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was cutting spaghetti straps for minimum wage in a warehouse," she says. 
"It was so boring I couldn't concentrate. I would always cut the wrong width, 
the wrong length. I was just about to be sacked when I was rescued and brought 
to the design department as an assistant designer." 
</P>
<P>
 She left Cole for New York, where in 1980 she landed a design position with 
Bobbie Brooks and met her future husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Battaglia, then an aspiring actor, describes their chance restaurant 
encounter. "She gave me this big smile. I was smitten," he says. "She looked 
like a young Sophia Loren, a saucy, Neapolitan beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later he moved into her apartment. Six years later, she popped the 
question. "I think her exact words were: 'Do you want to get married this 
year?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Piccone was equally forthright when her mother questioned the wisdom of making 
swimsuits from rubber. As Rita Piccone recalls: "I said: 'Oh, God, Robin, that 
is rubber. You're not going to get anybody to buy a one-piece suit of rubber. 
They'll die on the beach.' She looked at me as if to say: 'You tend to your 
business and I'll tend to mine.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ruttenstein recognizes the trait. "There's an intuitive aspect to her designs 
that makes her special," he says. "It has to do with a lot of self-confidence, 
a lot of knowledge and a lot of talent. When I look at her clothes and 
swimwear, I think only of Robin." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, so does the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 
New York. It recently requested two of Piccone's original neoprene suits and a 
miniskirt for its collection. "They coincide with the changing views of women 
in the last 20 years to present themselves as both strong and athletic, and yet 
be sexy," explains Jennifer Loveman, senior research assistant at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recently, other designers -- such as Donna Karan -- have begun to use 
industrial materials, and we wanted to represent the origin of that fabric 
moving from the functional into the fashionable." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's what design is," Piccone says. "Finding new uses for old 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Piccone's work is guided by a deceptively simple precept: "I like striking 
silhouettes and minimal ornamentation. There is always detail, but not always 
where you would expect. Sometimes it's how an armhole is cut, or how the 
silhouette will follow from back to front. That's why it's hard to knock us 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration for what is eventually reduced to a simple felt-tip drawing on 
white paper comes from anywhere -- mosaic tile patterns, color combinations on 
the street, antiques she buys (textiles, clothing, jewelry, furniture, sepia 
prints) and, of course, her children. 
</P>
<P>
 She hand-smocks some of their garments, so last year, Piccone says, "I did a 
group of smocked dresses. And I made some dresses with sashes, with the look of 
children's wear. And there was a plaid fabric I used for a swim line that was 
from a fabric I used for one of their shorts. It's in the details. It doesn't 
take over." 
</P>
<P>
 How many plaids or how much smocking she uses for Guess? swimwear will be 
entirely her call. "We work closely," Marciano says, "but Robin is definitely 
in total control of her line. She has the latitude to be as sexy and sensual as 
she wants, or she can go totally classic." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a really interesting hookup," Piccone says. "What I love about 
Guess? -- and what I've incorporated into the line -- is a very American-hybrid 
look. It's very modern, yet slightly retro." But nowhere on the $36-to-$72 
suits is the name Robin Piccone.  
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer it that way," she says. "I don't want anyone to be confused in any 
way with my own label," a collection that is more expensive, more sophisticated 
and, happily for aging boomers, more concealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the thing that defines me is that I was born with a tremendous need 
to create and make things," Piccone says. "I was talking with a friend who also 
claims that need. She said she can't sit down at the table without wanting to 
make the pie and then wanting to make the bowl the pie is in." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a similar story for Piccone's design process: "I'm constantly revising, 
constantly trying to improve until I can't do any more because I've run out of 
time."

BY DESIGN; Q&A; DAVID BAILEY; IMAGE MAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Bailey is one of England's most famous photographers. He inspired 
Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film "Blowup," courted a string of model 
girlfriends (among them Jean Shrimpton and Penelope Tree) and wed four 
glamorous women -- including actress Catherine Deneuve. He helped revolutionize 
Britain's staid fashion photography, ushering in the Swinging '60s. In his 
UK/LA 1994 Festival photography show at Santa Monica College (through Oct. 8) 
are gritty portraits of famous people, including Jack Nicholson, who is 
godfather to Bailey's son, Fenton. Bailey, 56, talked with writer Maureen 
Sajbel about work, friends and his reputation for biting the hand that once fed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: In the late '50s, when you started, is it correct to say that 
fashion photography was more like the picture we had in the film "Funny Face" 
-- Avedon, aloof models and tripods? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yeah, more or less. It wasn't true in America, but in England, all the 
top photographers, apart from (Norman) Parkinson, were gay. Theirs was a 
homosexual view of women, ours was a heterosexual view of women. I'm not saying 
one was better than the other; it's just a different view. We were people 
photographing girls who wanted to sleep with them rather than ones who wanted 
to look like them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: One of the only images we have now of your era is Antonioni's film 
"Blowup." How accurate was that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not very, really. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The photographer in it was dismissive of the models. How accurate was that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's not a true picture. The more you fall in love with the girl, the more 
she's going to give to the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think of models today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I've only got one who's a friend, Christy Turlington. I don't even know the 
others. I love the way Christy looks and I love the way she is. She's not full 
of herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you pay attention to current fashion photography? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I can't take things too seriously, especially fashion photography. I can't 
bear those megalomaniacs who think they're geniuses because they take a few 
snaps. Fashion is superficial. Every now and then a fashion picture transcends 
being a fashion picture and becomes a bit more interesting. But very few. A 
(Irving) Penn or (Richard) Avedon. The most it can be is a social document. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the current look of magazines? 
</P>
<P>
 A: All the fashion magazines I've seen recently have been about the '70s. It's 
silly. I always think photographers should take pictures in their own time. I 
see no merit in doing something that's been done before unless you bring 
something new to it. What they're doing now is not as good as Helmut Newton. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would you say to an aspiring fashion photographer today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Do videos. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Skip still photos altogether? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the still thing is gone on the fashion level. They don't really 
want those pictures. They want to show the frocks. They want turnover. It's 
disposable. The interesting thing is videos. I think lots of people who are 
video-makers now, like David Fincher (director of the new "Love Is Strong" 
video in which the Rolling Stones are giants roaming New York City), would have 
been fashion photographers in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In everything written about you, there's very little that praises your deep 
understanding of fashion. You never cared much about the clothes? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not much. It was what was in the clothes that I found interesting. An 
amusing little pleat never made a big impression. I liked Balenciaga and Saint 
Laurent and Mme. Gres because I thought they were artists. I'm the one who 
turned Catherine Deneuve on to Saint Laurent. I hated the way she dressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did she think of the way you dressed? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I didn't ask her. I've always dressed the same. Jeans in summer. Corduroys 
in winter. This is my first pair of black jeans. I read that (entertainment 
mogul and activist) David Geffen wore them, so I thought if they're good enough 
for David Geffen, they're good enough for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you start with fashion? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was just a kid taking pictures. I didn't mean it to be fashion. When I 
was about 20 years old, Vogue offered me a contract. Then you get trapped in 
it. It took me about 10 years to get away from fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What turned you off? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's quite boring. All that waiting around I can't bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would lure you back? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If Vogue says "will you do a special thing with Julia Roberts?" I'd say 
yes. It's got to be more than a girl standing against some palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What came after fashion? 
</P>
<P>
 A: From the late '60s onward I directed commercials, mostly beauty 
commercials. In the late '60s, early '70s I did documentaries. Then gradually 
more advertising. Now, primarily commercials and films for television. I just 
did a film with Juliet Stevenson for Channel 4, an (English) arts channel.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm doing a new book with my wife (the former Catherine Dyer, mother of his 
three young children) that's also going to be a film and an exhibition. 
There'll be a bit of fashion in this one. It's called "The Lady Is a Tramp," 
after the Rodgers and Hart song. Fay Weldon is writing it and it comes out May 
1st. I just shot a video with Catherine Deneuve for Malcolm McLaren's new 
record "Paris Paris." There are two versions -- a sexy version for Europe and a 
not-so-sexy one for England. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which version does America get? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They'll probably have to have the English version. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you had negative reactions to your work? 
</P>
<P>
 A: All my life. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your S & M bondage series (a controversial exhibit titled "Nudes 
1981-1984") created a furor. 
</P>
<P>
 A: It wasn't about bondage at all, just the opposite in fact, about the awful 
way women are used. It was influenced by (Jesus') shroud and by a picture done 
in 1938 by Bravo, the Mexican photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you doing any of this sexually provocative work today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. And by the way, all my ex-wives are all my best friends. All the women 
I've been with have been strong like granite. This thing about Bailey being 
chauvinistic is not true. I like tough, independent women.  
</P>
<P>
 My fashion photographs are more like portraits of women in clothes. I liked 
the peculiar girls. I hated the generic model who came with a big bag and had 
blue eyes and blond hair. I preferred Anjelica Huston and Marisa Berenson and 
Penelope Tree. Tough cookies. That's why I like them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've said you liked fashion only because that's where the girls were. But 
now in your exhibition of portraits, it looks like you prefer shooting the 
gritty, unshaven faces of men, like Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I know this is chauvinistic, but I always feel guilty if I don't make women 
look good. I feel women want to look good, except for a few extreme feminists 
who don't know what they really want anyway. Maybe it's me being wrong, but 
with men, I feel you can go for it. I don't mind if I get a pimple on the end 
of their noses. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did the students at the opening (of the UK/LA 1994 Festival) ask you about 
breaking into the business? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You have to tell them it's easy, otherwise they don't like you. If you tell 
them it's hard and only one in a million is going to make it, then they think 
you're not very nice. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: "Blowup" launched a thousand photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 A: It was nice when "Shampoo" came along. Then they all wanted to be 
hairdressers.

BY DESIGN; SUITS, GLORIOUS, SUITS; THEY'RE NO MERE CLOTHES, AN ART CRITIC SAYS. 
THEY CAN TURN A MAN INTO A WORK OF ART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anne Hollander is mad about suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Other people may dismiss them as dreary symbols of conformity, the predictable 
retreat of the terminally unimaginative. Not Hollander. In her new apologia, 
"Sex and Suits" (Alfred A. Knopf), the art critic contends that the suit is 
nothing less than an aesthetic triumph, a grand design that continues to please 
hundreds of years after its invention. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollander's besotted view, the tailor does what the personal trainer may 
not be able to: make every man look like a hero -- wide of shoulder, narrow of 
hip, noble, rational, modern and, above all, sexy. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hollander explained in an interview from her home in New York City, she has 
always been an admirer of a properly cut suit, even the widely vilified 
pin-striped, three-piece kind. As a student at the Cleveland School of Art in 
the late 1940s, she learned to love the way well-tailored clothing seemed to 
give men a second, better skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Among the persons in clothes I couldn't get enough of," she said, "were men 
in suits." Her colleagues may have been gaga for the nude, but the young 
Hollander always understood the erotic superiority of the clothed, especially 
the suited, male. She relished the look of a clad arm flung over a chair, the 
sinuous line of a trousered leg, the way a flexed knee caused good wool to 
drape. "I did hundreds of drawings of men making . . . wonderful wrinkles," she 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The ancient ancestor of the modern suit was the suit of armor, Hollander 
explained. Until early in this century, women wore clothes that denied the 
reality of their bodies. They have been segmented like wasps, turned into 
facsimiles of sailing ships by billowing skirts, had their breasts rearranged, 
even flattened out of visual existence. At times men's bodies have also been 
disguised, but at some point late in the 16th Century, men invented for 
themselves the ideal garment, one that enveloped the body but visually enhanced 
it in the process, suggesting all the wonders that were underneath the costume 
without emphasizing the inevitable flaws. The suit, the glorious suit, was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its titillating title, Hollander's book is really the story of the 
evolution of modern dress, the subtitle of the book. You can't talk about 
fashion, Hollander said, without talking about both men and women. Western 
fashion has always been about the interaction of the sexes, and the suit is no 
exception. It never existed in a gender vacuum, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not you accept her theses, much of the pleasure of reading her book 
is in the factoids. Hollander tosses out wonderful tidbits about that vastly 
interesting subject of what we wear to rip out the hearts of the people we want 
to go to bed with.  
</P>
<P>
 She tells us that the parts of early suits rarely matched, for instance, and 
that those in which jacket, trousers and vest were all made of the same fabric 
were known as "a suit of dittoes." She also disseminates information previously 
known only to "Jeopardy!" champions, such as the fact that the tape measure was 
invented circa 1820 for the sole purpose of advancing the nascent ready-to-wear 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hollander's landmark 1975 study, "Seeing Through Clothes," the new book 
reflects her conviction that pictures -- paintings, movies, even MTV -- have 
always influenced how we view ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the foundations of Western civilization," she said, a 
perceptual truth that dates to the ancient Greeks. "We need realistic 
representations to believe in our own existence." 
</P>
<P>
 It is no accident, she said, that the mirror is framed, just as a picture is. 
"We invented the mirror to help ourselves measure up. We put something like a 
picture in there and try to resemble it." The picture of what we want to look 
like precedes the reality: "That's why we frown when we look in the mirror." 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion is an art, not a designers' plot, Hollander said, one that has been 
linked with the other visual arts for millennia. Our politics and economic 
views may influence how we regard what we and other people wear, but the 
pleasure we take in fashion -- our lust for certain garments and a certain look 
-- is determined largely by an internalized aesthetic shaped by paintings, 
advertising art and other pictures.  
</P>
<P>
 In Hollander's view, images of model Claudia Schiffer loom larger in the 
scheme of things fashionable than whether interest rates rise or fall or 
whether American values are leaning left or right. Art matters, she insisted. 
"People look at each other with such things in their mind's eye. This I 
believe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hollander's conviction that art and clothing have intimate ties was confirmed 
by her study of art history. The serious student of costume must study art if 
he or she wants to appreciate clothes in their context, she said. "In order to 
study the history of clothing, you are absolutely in bed with the history of 
art. You're not going to get anywhere looking at surviving shreds." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of the durability of suits -- a term Hollander uses as shorthand for 
all of tailored menswear -- is the eagerness with which women appropriated 
them. She is not surprised that the 20th Century has seen the closing of the 
traditional Great Divide between women's clothes and men's, not just in the 
flourishing of masculine-inspired couture by Coco Chanel and others but in such 
ad hoc proof as the universal swiping of boyfriends' shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Suits have an eternally flattering "abstracting quality," she said. "Look what 
they do for men." How does the suit work this potent magic? "It only refers to 
what is under it. It doesn't outline what's under it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollander is rhapsodic on the superiority of suits. Consider the bad old days 
when women teetered on high heels, under headdresses that looked like 
chandeliers, steering skirts the size of small buildings. "You didn't have your 
body at all," she lamented. "You were an upholstered sofa in Shakespearean 
times. And now here you have the nude body made out of wool." 
</P>
<P>
 In a suit, she said, "You are a work of art as you walk around." Specifically, 
you are a work of modern art, all pleasing planes harmoniously arranged. Most 
important, she noted, "You are also a work of sex."  
</P>
<P>
 In her view, the suit is the perfect uniform for the scrimmage of appetite. 
And yes, she wears them, although she also likes very feminine clothes because 
of her full bust and small waist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many men admit that they love their suits, but they often have nothing but 
vile things to say about its common complement, the tie. Hollander will have 
none of this talk about the tie as the work of the Antichrist. She conceded 
that for some the tie "suggests oppression, repression, suppression, depression 
and constriction." 
</P>
<P>
 But stop your whining, she said, and appreciate the tie in all its phallic 
splendor. "The tie is the great flourish and marvel that finishes off the 
suit," she said. "It's the perfect accent under the face and above the bod."  
</P>
<P>
 She has no sympathy with people who hate them. The ability to appreciate 
cultural resonance is evidence of one's humanity, she said, "and the ability to 
overcome discomfort shows you are a grown-up." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the glories of the tie, she added, is that it has no real purpose. 
"It's all pure pleasure." And it is most definitely not the work of the devil: 
"It's the work of Mercury, which all fashion is -- the god of swift changes."

DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT: A SECOND-CHANCE SHOP; FIRST IT WAS FRESH LEATHER. NOW IT'S 
ROADKILL THE STORE -- FOR RECYCLED RAGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most folks might think of "road kill" as creature pizza on hot asphalt, but 
Robert Rasmussen interprets the phrase as something used, lost or just plain 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Rasmussen dreamed of founding a company named Roadkill that would sell all the 
baseball caps he spotted on the freeways. It was a venture that got swept away 
alongside the caps in speeding traffic, but the name of the company was 
resurrected in 1992 when he started cutting leather into jewelry and selling it 
to Nordstrom and other stores. 
</P>
<P>
 His bracelets, earrings, chokers and hair accessories recall the Brady Bunch 
years, but Rasmussen insists that they're every bit modern among his high 
school and college clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 With the wholesale end flourishing, Rasmussen returned to his entrepreneur 
fantasies of hawking recycled fashions with the Labor Day weekend opening of 
Roadkill the Store near the Orange Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenesters from around the county fill the tiny shop on Sundays looking for 
disco duds before heading to Club 1970s in Los Angeles. And Rasmussen is always 
there to dress them head to toe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know them really well," says the thirtysomething store owner about his 
"Reality Bites"-style patrons. "I'm one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers find clothes to fit their scenes -- from bowling shirts to hippie 
halter tops -- that are inexpensive, secondhand and kinda one-of-a-kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Racks are thoughtfully crammed with hideously fabulous men's polyester shirts, 
crochet tops, cardigans, girlish blouses and trousers. Used Levis are $6 to 
$20. Skin jackets run the range from suede ($40) to elk ($100). 
</P>
<P>
 Shelves are stacked high with fisherman sweaters (around $15), flannel shirts 
($7-$12) and Pendletons ($18). Mexican purses, hippy shoulder bags, scarves and 
knit hats burst from old travel trunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver necessities, such as hoops, rings and ID bracelets, as well as beaded 
necklaces and embroidered patches get tagged on brown paper, in line with that 
'90s back-to-basics image. ROSE APODACA JONES

OFF THE CUFF; DELICATE MANEUVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 R on Cohan has owned Zia Jewelry, a gallery of contemporary Southwest jewelry 
and art across from the old Mission in San Juan Capistrano, for 18 years. 
Because he works most holidays -- traditionally big gift-giving times -- he 
says he thinks of most of his regular customers as family. One woman brings him 
cookies every Christmas, and some send cards on Valentine's Day and his 
birthday.  
</P>
<P>
 Zia is a non-traditional jewelry store, known for colorful, dramatic pieces. 
"It's the place to go to get that zip in your look," says Cohan, "not where you 
go to get a watch battery."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There are three big misconceptions about the jewelry business. 
</P>
<P>
 People have a belief that jewelry is indestructible, and that if they pay a 
lot of money for it, nothing should every happen to it. But the very thing that 
makes jewelry beautiful is its delicateness. 
</P>
<P>
 It's made with delicate metals, gold and silver. They are soft, malleable 
metals, not steel or lead. Tiny little channels or prongs hold gems in place, 
not big clamps. And gemstones are frail; even diamonds will shatter with force. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewelry is valuable because of its beauty and delicateness. It's fragile and 
needs to be treated with care.  
</P>
<P>
 The second misconception is that people should wear the same piece of jewelry 
forever. No one would wear the same outfit or hairstyle forever, nor would 
someone drive the same car or live in the same house forever. We get tired of 
things, and things get old; they deteriorate and go out of style. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll actually like your jewelry more if you put it away for a while, or 
maybe you should give it away so it will be new to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the third misconception is that there is a very high markup in 
jewelry. Business is very competitive, especially in California. There are more 
jewelry stores here than in the rest of the country put together. 
</P>
<P>
 People are good shoppers. A jeweler can't charge excessive markups and not 
have someone a block away undercut him. If anyone can afford to sell it for 
less, they will. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes me grit my teeth in this business is when a woman returns a gift 
and makes a big deal out of the fact that her husband made a bad choice and 
shouldn't have bought her the item. It's so hard in this macho world for a lot 
of men to express their love, and sometimes buying jewelry is the only way they 
can do it. It just crushes them when the lady brings it back. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that she will never receive another piece of jewelry from him for the 
rest of her life. He will never make that mistake again. 
</P>
<P>
 The better solution is that if you receive something that's not to your taste, 
shop with him. Put it on your finger and point to it and say, "I love this." 
Bring pictures home that show what you want. Give him ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the joy of working in and running a jewelry store is I get to meet a 
lot of people who have been married a long time. Some are celebrating an 
anniversary of 30 or 50 years -- and it's interesting to me because I've been 
married two years, and I want my marriage to last, so I ask these couples 
what's their secret. All the answers revolve around the concept of compromise.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: STYLE IN THE FIRST DEGREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Series: "Sweet Justice" (NBC, Thursday, 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Intense Kate Delacroy (Melissa Gilbert, pictured left) joins the 
law firm of wise, seasoned Carrie Grace Battle (Cicely Tyson, pictured right) 
in fight for justice somewhere in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Nanrose Buchman, whose credits include two seasons on 
the series "Fame," as well as several movies of the week. (Betsy Cox designed 
costumes for the pilot.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Leslie Abramson and Marcia Clark, are you watching? Authentic trial 
attorneys could learn a thing or two from this consistently stylish, 
professional-looking pair. Notice that their legs are never on parade, although 
young Kate's knees definitely are; that they never look flashy; that their 
hairdos are under complete control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Details: As the enormously chic elder stateswoman, Carrie favors soft 
suits -- either made from knits or from traditional suit fabrics cut in 
feminine shapes -- and adds very little else, other than quirky, owl-like 
reading glasses; a Cartier-style tank watch, and a neat Jackie Kennedy bouffant 
streaked with gray. Even though Kate's courtroom hairpieces -- buns and braids 
-- should be ruled inadmissible, she really can pep up a straightforward 
jacket, straight skirt and trousers with a strategically placed antique brooch 
or necklace and "T-shirt" of cashmere, silk or rayon. Oh, and spike-heeled 
pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 You Should Know: Pay attention and you actually see Kate repeat clothing from 
episode to episode. The character is dressed from a pre-shopped wardrobe of 16 
suits (to be worn late summer through fall), which means she dresses pretty 
much as a real woman does. For instance, she wears the jacket of a pearl gray 
pantsuit with a black straight skirt. Or she wears the pantsuit with a black 
T-shirt, a white T-shirt or no shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: The vague Southern locale offers many of the characters radiating around 
the principals to appear in, if not antebellum, then quaint old picture-frame 
hats, pearls, upswept Miss America hairdos, floral chiffon dresses and scarves 
galore. Attorney Ross A. Ross (Jim Antonio) looks properly genteel in bow ties 
and vests. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemline Watch: Two or three inches above the knee for Kate, mid-knee for 
Carrie. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I tuned in to Court TV. You see a lot of navy suits and shell 
blouses, pretty much off-the-rack things that aren't particularly 
well-tailored," Buchman says . 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Kate's suits are mostly Barneys New York private label, Isabel Ardee 
(at Barneys) and Nik Janik from Neiman Marcus. Some of the antique jewelry 
belongs to Gilbert. Carrie wears primarily the Armani and Yves Saint Laurent 
labels; the eyeglasses are Tyson's. The bow ties are from Brooks Brothers and 
Nordstrom. BETTY GOODWIN

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: SOME WEIRD HOPPENINGS ON THE PLAYBOY BUNNY TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It promised to be the fantasy dream party for every heterosexual male. But in 
reality, Saturday night's benefit fashion show at the Playboy mansion was a 
wacky twist on the Hugh Hefner dream world from days of yore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hoppening," produced by New York club diva Susanne Bartsch and Playboy 
Enterprises, was a veritable den of bunnies -- 99% of them men. Drag queens 
from both coasts, it seemed, couldn't wait to see the evening's pie ce de re 
sistance -- a competition among designers from all over the world to create the 
ultimate '90s bunny suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the judges were Phyllis Diller, a very pregnant Cassandra (Elvira) 
Paterson, Debi Mazar, Cheech Marin and James McDaniel. But the top three 
bunnies made us wonder about the future of politically incorrect attire. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bondage Bunny, by Los Angeles genius leather designer Abel Villarreal, 
featured a corseted, 18-inch-waisted model, Heather Sweet, who was carried 
onstage in what looked like a leather mermaid outfit. She hopped down the 
runway, her feet buckled together and a carrot stuffed in her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Second place went to two stylists-turned-designers from New York, Mathu & 
Zaldy. 
</P>
<P>
 And the winner was . . . Roseanne. That girl certainly gets around! She wore a 
gray silk taffeta Bunny costume created by L.A. designer Richard Tyler.  
</P>
<P>
 And you thought "Baywatch" babe Pamela Anderson shoulda won? Sorry, wrong 
crowd. At any rate, the evening raised $600,000 for AIDS charities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Timing Couldn't Be Worse: On the eve of the Italian ready-to-wear 
collections, some of the fashion world's finest are being questioned in that 
country's ongoing corruption scandal. Santo Versace, brother and business head 
of Gianni Versace's fashion empire; Mariuccia Mandelli, alias Krizia, and 
luxury jeweler Gianmaria Buccellati are among those queried, the Associated 
Press reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other businesses under investigation, the fashion industry is accused of 
paying tax inspectors to overlook bookkeeping infractions. "In a short while," 
quipped Gianni Versace in Milan's Corriere della Sera newspaper, "they even 
will be investigating the saints." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Comeback Kid: After a four-year hiatus, the California Mart is back in the 
fashion show and trophy business in a grand way. And despite recent financial 
travails at the Downtown apparel center, organizers say the shows will go on. 
</P>
<P>
 David Dart, Leon Max, Bonnie Strauss and the design team of Maggie Barry and 
Ty Moore for Van Buren will compete Oct. 11 for 1994 California Designer of the 
Year at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel. Vying for the Rising Star award will be 
Pamela Barish, Jonathon Hoenscheidt for Freewear, Janet Howard for misc., Doris 
and Michael Lew for Imaginary Concepts and Fati Moschery for Moschery. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards evening will cap two days of fashion shows by more than 50 
California designers. The California Collections, as the event is called, 
attracts buyers, store personnel and press nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the awards night (cocktails, dinner, fashion shows and award 
presentations) are $100 each. Proceeds will benefit the AIDS charity L.A. 
Shanti. For more information, call (213) 239-9311. 
</P>

<P>
 Batter Up: We haven't exactly been crying into the Pratesi sheets every night 
because the baseball season has been canceled. But a patch we spotted on a 
baseball jersey at the local mall was cause for pause. It reads: "For the 
brothers who played and never got paid."  
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden, sports apparel had some appeal. Spending $28 for a heavy-duty 
T with smashing graphics that herald the defunct Negro Leagues seemed to make 
perfect sense. The shirts, caps, and shorts (available at Broadway, Champs and 
Foot Locker stores) are made by Underground Railroad, a company owned by former 
L.A. Ram Ivory Sully. A football player making money off unpaid baseball 
players -- imagine that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good News, Ladies: We put our trash in bins at the curbs, bundle our 
newspapers, crush our cans and still we don't do enough. What about the waste 
we make every month, at that time of the month?  
</P>
<P>
 Well, we found a way to redeem ourselves. Deep in the pages of Transitions for 
Health (subtitled: A catalogue of natural health & quality of life products by 
women for women of all ages) we found 100% breathable woven cotton menstrual 
pads, tastefully named "Glad Rags."  
</P>
<P>
 Delightful, no? It gets better. We can wash and wear them for up to five 
years, the catalogue says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Catalogue? Magazine? Or Just Plain Old Self-Promotion?: If it's editorial, it 
has credibility. If it's advertising, it doesn't -- or so they tried to tell us 
in journalism school. Sometimes, though, it's hard to tell the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Neiman Marcus, in its self-promoting "commemorative" InCircle Magazine, 
ran a little item on the catalogue-length ad insert it had Helmut Newton shoot 
for the September Harper's Bazaar. Now comes Saks Fifth Avenue with a big fall 
catalogue containing a six-page, black-and-white spread on "Schiano Style." 
</P>
<P>
 At least Allure, when it shamelessly ran a story last year on its own Polly 
Allen Mellen, the longtime Conde Nast fashion editor, explained who she is. 
Saks apparently thinks Marina Schiano, whom retailing and publishing insiders 
know for her work as Vanity Fair's style director and as a longtime executive 
of Yves Saint Laurent, needs no introduction. But the little spread, with its 
candid-seeming photos and type burned over the pictures, looks like a magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 So let's see: If it's a store magazine article about ads the store put in a 
real magazine, it's. . . . No, wait: If it's in a catalogue but looks like a 
magazine and promotes someone who does styling for Conde Nast, it's . . . oh, 
forget it. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Social Agenda: Giorgio Armani, who hasn't paid an official visit to Los 
Angeles since '88, has agreed to serve as honorary chairman of the upcoming 
Fire & Ice ball, Dec. 7 at Fox Studios . . . Chanel will present its new fine 
jewelry collection Oct. 4 in a setting very few Angelenos have had a chance to 
see: the Ennis-Brown House, a Frank Lloyd Wright landmark built in the mid 
'20s. French architect Thierry W. Despont will create the setting for the 
exhibit, hosted by Chanel President Arie L. Kopelman and benefiting Center 
Theatre Group Volunteers.

HOT PROPS: THE FUR FLIES 
</P>

<TEXT>

 The autumn equinox today signals earlier sunsets, cooler evenings and the 
return of glamour. Even in these parts, where it doesn't snow, the nights and 
mornings allow for a hat, sometimes gloves and a voluptuous coat. Nothing says 
glamour like plush animal prints. Nothing says good taste like faux fur. 
Besides prints, this season there is also a bright selection of solids, adds 
Lucille Klein, fashion director for JCPenney's women's division. "The new fake 
furs are extraordinary looking. These coats are just what we need during drab 
days to perk us up. They serve a practical purpose, too," she adds. Coats and 
jackets run about $160. Canned Heat

 Vanguard designer Jean-Paul Gaultier admits he's a man obsessed with a woman 
in a corset. In interviews he refers to a Rilke-like fascination he had as a 
boy with his grandmother's underthings. He fashioned a bullet-bra corset with 
pin-stripe suits and, later, costumes for Madonna's Blonde Ambition tour -- a 
credit that turned the Frenchman into a household name. Now Gaultier wraps a 
flesh-tinted corset around a shapely bottle: the perfect container, he 
apparently figures, to hold his signature Haute Parfumerie. Unveiled nationwide 
exclusively at Saks Fifth Avenue this week, Gaultier's debut entry into the 
competitive fragrance market has been met with "tremendous excitement," notes 
Saks' Steve Bock. "It has an ageless appeal specifically because it's such a 
wonderful fragrance." The scent is a concoction of sweet notes of Tunisian 
orange blossom, Bulgarian rose, Italian tangerine, Chinese star anise; spicy 
orchid, iris, ylang-ylang and Indian ginger, and dry down notes of vanilla, 
amber wood and musk. Find perfume (30 milliliters) for $150, eau de toilette 
(50 milliliters) for $52. No doubt the hot bottle holds well among collectors, 
too. Each bottle is stored in a tin can -- another item Gaultier has long 
adored. He cut cans into bracelets as a youth; for him, the utilitarian can 
once considered a jewel now is a jewel case. Happy Days Again

 The eternal flame for the '50s, fins and James Dean burns stronger again this 
season, according to trend watchers. Young men have rediscovered the true-blue, 
five-pocket jean classic and are wearing them cuffed and closer to their actual 
size than ever before. And for a footnote, Hush Puppies, low-tops, penny 
loafers, biker boots and (yes) suede buckskins are the recent retro flavor. 
Interest in '50s-style shoes is being backed by orders and sales for fall, 
according to a recent issue of the trade journal Footwear News. Consider it a 
teen version of the return to emphasized style, pompadour coif optional. ROSE

CLOSET RX; CARPE CREPE; FEELING TOO OLD FOR GRUNGE BUT TOO HIP TO DRESS LIKE 
DAD? DRESS UP YOUR LOOK A LITTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a guy closes in on 30, there often comes a time when he looks in the mirror 
and realizes his face is different, yet familiar. He opens his closet and finds 
that the reason that face looked familiar is that he's turning into his father. 
He leafs through the button-down collar shirts, wool slacks, looks down at his 
Wee-juns and sighs -- gray hair must be just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Referred to as "Generation Xers" by some sociologists, these aging 
twentysomethings have grown beyond the grunge look, yet are not ready to give 
up their youth. For those who have found they've got nothing to wear to a nice 
party but the uniform of an accountant, there are alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Slacks made with a "crepe" weave could become the standard for those trying to 
fit into a younger look.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is really going to span every age group," says Mark Schell of Mark 
Schell Designs for Men in Corona del Mar. "You can wear a shirt and pair of 
slacks made of a crepe fabric, and it will stand out. It's a hot young fashion 
item; it's fashionable yet understated." 
</P>
<P>
 Gen-X neckwear also tends to be understated and muted -- even to the point of 
nonexistence. "Keeping the top button closed is still a popular look when 
you're wearing a nice shirt," Schell says. "It's been a fashion statement for a 
while, and guys are still doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to be more casual can experiment with the "immigrant" look, 
says Keli Sullivan of Structure in Costa Mesa. Like the "peasant" clothing 
popular two decades ago, it's simple and loose-fitting. "You can wear 
collarless shirt, known as a band collar, along with blue or black jeans or 
corduroys," she says. "Then dress it up with a leather vest." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're sticking to the true Gen-X style, stay away from bright colors. 
"Browns and grays are big, especially for fall and winter," Sullivan says. 
"Plaids are also back, and plaid flannel shirts are still in. However, they're 
more fitted, and a lot of guys are tucking in the front to show off their belt 
buckles and leaving the back hanging out." 
</P>
<P>
 The layered look has also returned, which means you might want to get a few 
thermal undershirts to wear in winter, along with some simple suspenders to 
complement them. 
</P>
<P>
 While teens may gravitate toward the imposing Doc Martens, Xers tend to prefer 
suede or leather rugged work boots, again in brown or gray. Birkenstocks can 
work, but only with dark socks. 
</P>
<P>
 To top off your reach for a youthful look, try growing a goatee. "Almost any 
facial hair is really in right now," Sullivan says. "As well as hair with a 
'tousled' look, like the guy in the Diet Coke commercials."

HOSPITAL MAKES FULL RECOVERY

 When the dust cleared after the Jan. 17 earthquake, St. John's Hospital and 
Health Center looked like a bad accident. The north wing of the 1940s structure 
was lost, and only outpatient services have been available for the last eight 
months.Now, the historic building has been patched up and is ready to reopen. 
The community will celebrate with a big "Bouncing Back" party Saturday, 11 
a.m.-3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Vera and the Beaters will perform a free concert. Numerous sports 
figures -- including Doug Christie and James Worthy of the Lakers, pro 
volleyball player Gabrielle Reece and Kelvin Hildreth, Sterling Forbes and 
Jeffrey Dollison of the Harlem Globetrotters -- will lend their support. 
</P>
<P>
 A parade, starting at Olympic School at 11th Street and Arizona Avenue, kicks 
off the event at 11 a.m. Among the many marchers following a one-mile route to 
St. John's will be the Cardiac Physicians Drill Team, the Santa Monica High 
Marching Band, L.A. Polo Club and Boy Scouts. A food court at the hospital will 
offer In-N-Out Burger, Ben & Jerry's ice cream and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports clinics include slam-dunk and three-point contests, led by the pro 
ballplayers; volleyball demonstrations by pro players Reece, Linda Chisholm and 
Linda Hanley. Also: games and free health screenings. The event is free. (310)

 ON THE ROAD, AGAIN: Some of the GM workers who left the Valley and moved to 
Anderson, Ind., in order to stay with the company may soon have to pack their 
bags again. . . . About 85 workers made the move east. Then, when GM sold part 
of its Anderson operations last month, they worried they might be out of work 
(D2). . . . But GM jobs now seem assured. One likely destination: Arlington, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 HOT ISSUE: The long-running dispute about whether firefighters can read 
Playboy in fire stations is over. They can. The county's decision not to appeal 
a ruling involving these sorts of magazines also was a victory for Antelope 
Valley Firefighter Steve Johnson (B1). . . . Playboy readers may have noticed 
that in June, in the midst of the debate, the magazine did a layout of female 
firefighters. Only coincidental, said the magazine's Bill Farley: "It had been 
planned about 1 1/2 years in advance." 
</P>

 YOUNG VOICE: Scott Himelstein is no Pat Summerall. Yet. But that's OK. He's 
still only in high school -- and he's already the radio voice of the Chaminade 
High Eagles in West Hills (C8). . . . The signal isn't great, and the 
production isn't smooth, but Himelstein (above) works hard. "The people love 
it," said Ed Croson, the school's athletic director. "The kid has started 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 UNIFORMGATE: First, the truck was hijacked. Now, the computer is the culprit. 
Either way, the new uniform program at La Mesa Junior High in Santa Clarita has 
become one giant mess. . . . School officials will try to explain what happened 
at a meeting tonight (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 NO DUMMY: She's the ditzy Ursula in "Mad About You," and she'll play the 
offbeat Phoebe in NBC's "Friends," premiering tonight. . . . Yet don't get the 
idea that Lisa Kudrow is an airhead. A 1981 Taft High graduate, she majored in 
biology at Vassar College. She says some of her characterizations are "based on 
the smartest people I met." Michael Arkush

 SUBDUING CONGRESS: Hillary Rodham Clinton was basking in relief Monday that 
hostilities with Haiti had been averted at the last moment -- with her husband 
recalling an invasion force of 82nd Airborne paratroopers who had been en route 
to the Caribbean when the deal with Haitian military leaders was struck. . . . 
In a chance White House hallway encounter, Mrs. Clinton was asked whether the 
Haiti "victory" would carry over into her efforts to get a health care reform 
bill through Congress. She noted that time was running out in the current 
legislative session, then said wistfully, "I wish I had the 82nd Airborne to 
send up to Capitol Hill."

 NO APPEAL: The appointment of former Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr to 
investigate the Whitewater affair apparently will not be challenged after all 
by Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.). Levin had argued that Starr, an active 
Republican, should not have been picked by a special three-judge panel because 
he was too partisan. . . . But the senator has since decided he won't quarrel 
with the appointment. Instead, he will ask the Senate to amend the law 
governing independent counsels so that the court must select appointees who 
have no actual or apparent conflict of interest -- on political, personal or 
financial grounds.

 STRATEGIC DELAY: The Pentagon, ever sensitive to the politics of defense 
spending, has quietly postponed until after the November elections any 
decisions on its proposal to curtail or cancel 10 major weapons programs. 
Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch disclosed the move to the Senate Armed 
Services Committee after senators whose states house large defense contractors 
criticized the Pentagon's possible cuts. Deutch also said the cuts would not 
even be proposed formally until January, when the fiscal 1996 budget is sent to 
Congress and that some of the cutbacks wouldn't have any real impact until the 
end of the decade. . . . Military officials have been grumbling since Deutch 
issued a memo in August ordering them to submit proposals for revising the 10 
programs -- and replacing them with less-expensive alternatives. The list 
included the Army's Comanche helicopter; the Air Force's joint primary aircraft 
training system and a new precision-guided missile system; the Navy's new 
attack submarine and the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey helicopter, and an advanced 
amphibious assault vehicle. Pentagon officials aren't saying how many of the 
programs actually might be axed.

 NOVEL TRUTH: Much has been written about the array of three-ring notebooks in 
the office of Ira Magaziner, who played a leading role in designing President 
Clinton's massive and complex health care reform plan. Those notebooks, the 
senior presidential adviser has boasted, held "all the answers" that any 
skeptic could pose about Clinton's 1,342-page plan. In retrospect, however, 
some Washington wags note that another book on Magaziner's shelves perhaps more 
accurately describes the Administration's now-stalled quest to overhaul the 
health care system: a medical thriller by Robin Cook titled "Fatal Cure."

 WORRIED WHITES: The Central Intelligence Agency, responding to concerns over 
actions taken to correct under-representation of women and minorities in 
important posts, has formed a study group to look at the spy agency's "worried 
white male," CIA Director R. James Woolsey disclosed at a hearing this week. 
Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) wondered if it constituted "a support 
group." Woolsey replied, "Not yet."

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: IF IT BURNS AND CRASHES, IT MUST BE A GUY THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was over lunch with a woman friend that a somewhat touchy subject arrived 
about the same time as the salad. We were talking about this week's Centerpiece 
story, and I had just asked my friend if she knew about mountain biking. Since 
she is a native Southern Californian who has not spent the last 10 years locked 
in an attic, of course, she had. 
</P>
<P>
 "But why are you writing about that ?" she asked. "Everyone knows about 
mountain biking, what is there to say about it that hasn't already been said?" 
</P>
<P>
 So I told her about night riding, the latest mountain biking fad for adherents 
who aren't getting the adrenaline rush they need from their sport. I explained 
how riders wait until dark, climb to the top of a hill, switch on high-power 
beams and barrel, kamikaze-style, into the great void. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when things got a bit uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is this," she asked, "some sort of guy thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 As an editor, I'm well aware of my responsibilities to be fair-minded, 
objective and sensitive to issues of race, religion and gender. But as a mother 
of a son and a daughter, I haven't failed to notice that one of my children 
always seems to be crashing, colliding and exploding, while the other one 
doesn't. And the exploding one generally is my son. 
</P>
<P>
 It now hit me that I was in dangerous territory, so instead of answering my 
friend's question I muttered something about nature versus nurture and headed 
back to the office. I figured I could make it staff writer Pancho Doll's 
problem. After all, he's the story's author. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certain there are some women who go night riding but I didn't come across 
any of them in the course of reporting this story. It seems to be an 
overwhelmingly fraternal activity," Doll said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's less, I believe, about testosterone and risk behavior and more about the 
relationship between the Y chromosome and need to buy really expensive gadgets. 
Most of these guys have bikes built out with the latest exotic materials. The 
advent of night riding simply means they can blow $300 on another accessory." 
</P>
<P>
 What's that they say about men, boys and the price of their toys? 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a social factor, though," Doll said. "It starts at an early age. 
Ever listen to kids just out of training wheels brag about how far from their 
respective driveways they have ridden? That's how it starts. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'I've been all the way to the corner,' says one. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Yeah, well I've been around the block,' says the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Same boys, fast forward 25 years, and that's night riding. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'I can take this trail without the light,' says one. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'I can do it one foot off the pedal," says the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the picture. It's like those commercials with Larry Bird and Michael 
Jordan. Off the floor, over the wall, nothing but net." 
</P>
<P>
 And they complain about shopping.

THEATER REVIEW; 'CALAMITY JANE' TAKES A FEMINIST LOOK AT HISTORY; AN 
EXPERIMENTAL WORK ABOUT ONE OF THE FRONTIER'S MOST-STORIED FIGURES MAKES ITS 
WEST COAST PREMIERE IN SANTA PAULA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the more interesting local productions these days are being supplied 
by the Santa Paula Theater Center as part of its "backstage" series. 
</P>
<P>
 It's currently presenting "Calamity Jane," the West Coast premiere of a play 
by Ojai author Katherine Ann Jones, in a space behind the main stage area and 
directed by Taylor Kasch. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is a respectable piece of feminist Western history, an apt corollary 
to the Santa Paula group's recent "Quilters." 
</P>
<P>
 How "experimental" is this production? Enough so that the playwright is 
already saying her vision is not evident on the Santa Paula stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the author's research through -- she admits -- conflicting historical 
documents, the play relates the celebrated frontiers woman's colorful life, 
including liaisons with Wild Bill Hickok and Buffalo Bill Cody. 
</P>
<P>
 The narration is done, in part, by Jane (Jody Kasch) and in part by her 
daughter, Janey (Sabrina Jean Garcia). 
</P>
<P>
 The third member of the cast, Jeff G. Rack, plays several male roles, and this 
production is accompanied throughout by projected videos. 
</P>
<P>
 A single mother and former actress herself, Jones said she was looking for a 
strong female role when she discovered a book about Martha "Calamity Jane" 
Canary and found much to identify with in the character. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones added that she was "particularly down on men" at the time, though those 
in this play do relatively well by the heroine. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jane meets Captain O'Neill, she agrees to release baby Janey to the 
Virginia gentleman and his wife, who are unable to have children of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Some years later, Jane meets her daughter, keeping the secret. It's only as an 
adult that Janey seeks out further information on the woman who turns out to be 
her birth mother. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the part that is wholly made up: Though the real Calamity Jane is said 
to have boasted of a daughter by Hickok, the fate of the daughter, if she ever 
existed, is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, the playwright, took pains after opening night to at least partially 
disassociate herself from the project, noting that "certain liberties had been 
taken" with the script. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently, she's referring to the elaborately filmed back projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in black and white comment on and supplement the onstage action. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, the palette shifts to color, and the focus diffuses. 
</P>
<P>
 That, director Kasch explains, is to show the distortion of Western legend. 
</P>
<P>
 The playwright's disclaimer notwithstanding, there's much to like about this 
"Calamity Jane," not the least of which is a fine display of acting by Rack. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program didn't indicate he was playing all of those parts, many members 
of the audience might be fooled. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Kasch cuts a strong swath as hard-drinking Jane, who could probably teach 
mule skinners a thing or two about cursing, and Garcia makes a sweet Janey. 
</P>
<P>
 One should also note that Jones is not a stranger to adaptation: A musical 
version of this play is currently being produced in New Jersey, and there's 
evidently talk of turning it into an opera. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Calamity Jane" 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday evenings at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 7:30 p.m., through 
Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Santa Paula Theater Center, 125 S. 7th St., Santa Paula 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Adults, $7.50; seniors and students, $5. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Due mainly to some salty language, this play is recommended for mature 
audiences only. For reservations or further information, call 525-4645

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: SINGING COWBOY A HARD TIME TO THE FANS OF LINE DANCING; ART 
GREEN MAKES IT CLEAR HE'S AN ACOUSTIC MAN WHO LOVES COUPLES DANCING, WALTZES 
AND SINGING SLOW, 'TEAR-JERKER' BALLADS. AND HE'S PACKING THE HOUSE. 
</P>

<P>
 In the midst of all this "Boot Scootin' " ballyhoo, you've got to respect a 
musician who lists on his resume the following goal: "to play clubs where line 
dancing IS NOT encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Professional suicide, you might think. But ever since Art Green, 32-year-old 
team-roping, filly-breaking, cattle-raising musician wandered into the Galleon 
Room in Goleta six years ago looking for work, he's been making a living as a 
real singing cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
 By choice, Green currently plays at only two nightclubs -- Zaca Creek 
Restaurant in his home town of Buellton and at the Galleon Room. But if we're 
lucky, Green will extend his appearances to Ventura County. Are you listening, 
club owners? 
</P>
<P>
 For now, run -- don't walk -- to catch Green and the Posse (Steve McPeters, 
lead guitar, fiddle; Richard Diaz, vocals, bass; John Rasmussen, vocals, drums) 
tonight through Saturday at the Galleon Room. And dance fans will want to 
arrive at 7 p.m. to learn the Schottische. Then stay for Green's music, which 
is well-suited to the couples-oriented dancing at the Galleon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bathed in warmly diffuse pink light, "Santa Barbara's original country music 
nightclub since 1980" is a comfortable place that feels more like someone's 
living room. Seating is conveniently arranged around the dance floor and stage. 
Lessons and music are geared for couple dances. But the club is also popular 
with singles. 
</P>
<P>
 And owner Susette Warynick prides herself on catering to the musical tastes of 
local fans. Currently featured groups include Sky King, the Fender Benders, 
Swingin' Doors (most of the Cache Valley Drifters) and Spaghetti Western. And 
the Rhythm Rangers, who got their start a few years ago as the club's house 
band, recently returned to join the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most popular draw, Art Green and the Posse, is still a best-kept 
secret to most Ventura County folks. Yet he packs the club whenever he appears 
and those in the know happily travel to Goleta to hear him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would stay all night with Art but we have to kick them out at 1:30," 
said Warynick. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake: Just because Green was raised on traditional country music 
and dislikes line dancing, doesn't make this Doug Supernaw look-alike a fuddy 
duddy in a white Resistol hat. The band covers tunes by Merle Haggard all the 
way to Alan Jackson and George Strait. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that he's an acoustic man who loves couples dancing, waltzes and 
singing those slow, "tear-jerker" ballads. And his beautiful voice is perfectly 
suited to that style. But Green can also infuse oldies such as "Brown-Eyed 
Girl" and Marshall Tucker's "Fire on the Mountain" with new blood. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to performing, Green has written some lovely songs. Listen for a 
pleasing ballad, "The Eye of a Hurricane," the up-tempo "She's Gotten Outta 
Hand," co-written with his brother, Marv, who recently accepted a songwriting 
job with Gold Wheat Productions in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, who has opened for many national acts including Steve Wariner, Doug 
Stone, Kenny Rogers and Sammy Kershaw, modestly mentioned that in 1991 he and 
his band were local and Southern California winners of the "True Value, GMC 
Truck Country Showdown," the nation's largest amateur country music talent 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you listen to Green, don't expect smoke and mirrors. Just let him 
strap on his beloved blond Gibson J-200 Jumbo Country acoustic guitar recently 
autographed by his idol, Merle Haggard. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come up to me and say I should move around more or tell jokes between 
the songs. But that's just not me," said Green. "Music is my job. So I let the 
music do the talking. My motto is pretty much, 'Shut up and sing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that out-of-towners are raiding our area for local talent. Santa 
Barbara-based Spaghetti Western played Saturday afternoon at the Great Western 
Rodeo in Inglewood -- Mark Collie and Trisha Yearwood headlined the evening 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene O'Connell & the Dixie Flyers were invited to open for Radney Foster on 
Saturday at the Desert Empire Fairgrounds in Ridgecrest. A $69 package includes 
room for two and tickets. Gates open for barbecue and dancing at 6:30 p.m., 
show time is 8 p.m. For details or tickets, call 619-446-4118. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Rhythm Rangers were recruited to perform Oct. 1 in Santa Monica for 
the Brentwood Chamber of Commerce Country & Western Night saluting David 
Horowitz, honorary mayor of Brentwood and television consumer activist. Our own 
Rick Henderson will teach the line dancing. Advance tickets, $75 per person, 
$95 at the door. Call 310-358-8787. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Art Green and the Posse. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: 8:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. tonight, 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Galleon Room, inside the Orchid Bowl, 5925 Calle Real (Highway 101 at 
Fairview), Goleta. 
</P>
<P>
 * CALL: 967-0128. 
</P>
<P>
 * ETC.: Art Green will also perform from 3 to 7 p.m. Sunday at the 
family-style barbecue, Paradise Store, located at San Marcos Pass and Paradise 
Road in Santa Barbara, 967-3254; Sept. 30 he's at Zaca Creek Restaurant in 
Buellton.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REDONDO BEACH; ADVISORY VOTE ON GUN PERMITS OKD FOR 1995 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Residents will have a chance next year to tell lawmakers whether more people 
should be allowed to carry concealed weapons. But the vote will be only 
advisory; state law, which overrides local law, allows only a police chief to 
determine who gets a permit for a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 3 to 2 Tuesday to place a proposed amendment to the 
city's charter on the March, 1995, ballot. Councilmen Stevan Colin and Robert 
Pinzler voted against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joseph Dawidziak said the vote will encourage public discussion 
about public safety and will show politicians what people may do if they don't 
feel safe in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such an emotional issue that putting an advisory measure on the ballot 
is going to send a clear message to public officials," Dawidziak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents concerned about rising crime in Southern California asked the 
council to allow anyone from Redondo Beach who wants a permit to have one, with 
some exceptions.  
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Melvin Nichols has issued only six permits, all to people who 
live outside the city but work in Redondo, Dawidziak said.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue of concealed weapon permits has been under review for several months 
by a charter review committee that has been considering various changes to the 
city charter. In August, the committee voted against liberalizing the rules 
regarding the permits. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the committee, City Atty. Jerry Goddard concluded that state 
law prohibits city charters from changing a police chief's power to issue 
concealed weapon permits. Dawidziak said he thinks that there is some room to 
challenge those laws but has concluded that the council should not spend the 
money to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not willing to get into some protracted legal battle over this," 
Dawidziak said. MARY GUTHRIE

NIGHT LIFE: TIMBUK3 PLAYS TO PROVE BAND IS NOT MERELY A ONE-HIT WONDER; THE 
TEXAS GROUP, KNOWN FOR THE 1986 HIT 'THE FUTURE'S SO BRIGHT I GOTTA WEAR 
SHADES,' PERFORMS SATURDAY NIGHT IN VENTURA. 
</P>

<P>
 A lot of actors get typecast because, perhaps, they do their job too well. 
Larry Linville will always be known as Frank Burns, Jerry Mathers will always 
be the Beav, and Lassie will always be some hairy dog with a big nose. 
</P>
<P>
 In rock 'n' roll there are a lot of groups tied forever to their greatest hit. 
Single-hit wonders Maurice Williams & the Zodiacs will forever be associated 
with their biggie: "Stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Timbuk3, who will make their Poinsettia City debut Saturday night, had a big 
hit in 1986 with the catchy "The Future's So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades." The 
song was nominated for a "best new artist" Grammy, but the group lost out to 
Bruce Hornsby. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Shades," the group continued to release critically acclaimed albums, 
but with diminishing sales -- a direct link, according to band member Pat 
MacDonald, to diminishing label support. 
</P>
<P>
 Timbuk3 began as a duo, MacDonald and his wife, Barbara, plus a boom box to 
handle everything but the guitars. Starting out as street musicians in 
Wisconsin, the MacDonalds decided they could be homeless if need be in a warmer 
climate -- Austin, Tex. But then the hit hit, and Timbuk3 was on tour with the 
likes of Bob Dylan, then appeared on Saturday Night Live, The Joan Rivers Show 
and Solid Gold, where they didn't even have to lip sync. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the band is up to four members, occasionally. As you can see from the 
picture, sometimes the bass player can't make it. When they show up at Art City 
on Saturday night, Timbuk3 will probably be a duo again. 
</P>
<P>
 The band members recently got out of their record deal with I.R.S. and signed 
with High Street Records, a subsidiary of Windham Hill. They just released a 
six-song EP titled "Looks Like Dark To Me," which is a preview of the next full 
album, "A Hundred Lovers," due out in February. The EP contains a new version 
of "Shades," plus a surreal version of the biker's anthem, "Born To Be Wild." 
</P>
<P>
 MacDonald spoke from Austin recently about matters, some more and some less, 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it a problem to have such a big hit so early in your career? 
</P>
<P>
 You know, it was something that got our music out there to a lot of people, 
but it wasn't a big enough hit for people to pick up on our next record. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it a shock to go so quickly from playing on the street to becoming rock 
stars? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, it was a pretty short period of time. I think that kind of stunned us to 
some extent. But now we've finally, through a lot of diligence, regained our 
underground status. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been lots of offers to use "Shades" in commercials? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, we've had a lot of standing offers but it got to be like a game show -- 
do we take the cash or door No. 2? We just couldn't let ourselves do it. The 
record company tried to get us to play ball with them, but we've always felt 
we've had more than just one song. I don't want to sound bitter about whatever 
success we've had, but we've put out five albums. We put a lot of work into our 
third album "Big Shot In The Dark." That's the only one I can still listen to. 
</P>
<P>
 What's up with "Born To Be Wild"? Are you guys trying to corner the biker 
market? 
</P>
<P>
 We've been playing that song for a few years, and every now and then when 
people wanted to hear one more, we'd do it. I worked it out on my guitar, and 
it's completely different when it's finger-picked. There's no bass, but I tune 
my guitar very low, so it's not exactly an acoustic sound or an electric sound. 
That's sort of what we've built our sound around lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did you record a new version of your old hit? 
</P>
<P>
 We've done three or four versions of it over the years. It still kind of bugs 
me more than any other song. It's definitely not one of my favorite songs that 
we've recorded. I always wished we could do it again with the right attitude. 
Live, we've butchered it as a dirge, then a ska thing. Our new label was 
interested in having a new version of it -- and we added a new verse -- so now 
maybe we can lay that one to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 But that song kept you from the dreaded day job, didn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, and we got a small advance from our new label. But I don't know about 
people that have jobs. I've had a couple of part-time jobs now and then, but 
I'd quit because I couldn't write songs. If you're going to be a songwriter, 
you better think you have something special, or at least the desire to do 
something special. I dropped out of high school when I was 14 to do music. 
</P>
<P>
 So where are the real Timbuk3 fans? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I remember one time we were playing in the park in San Francisco when 
the earthquake happened. We were playing for a lot of people in business suits, 
but also a lot of homeless people. When I saw all the homeless, I felt we had 
truly found our audience. They could definitely relate to our song, "Dirty 
Rice." We've been poor for long, long periods of time, so we have a certain 
slant that certain people can appreciate. I have a problem when they charge 12 
dollars to see a show. 
</P>
<P>
 When was the last time you guys played California? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we played at our A&R guy's wedding last year, and we came out to mix the 
new album, but we haven't had a real gig in California for awhile. I love the 
road. I use the time to just sort of space out and write. I don't mean drugs, 
either; we're pretty straight. I even drive sometimes, but other people usually 
prefer that I don't. Details

SOUNDS: IMPROVISATIONAL VOCALS AND 'HUMS' HEADED FOR CITY HALL; BONNIE 
BARNETT'S STYLE HAS BEEN CALLED AVANT GARDE AND UNORTHODOX. SO WHAT'S SHE DOING 
AT VENTURA'S SEAT OF GOVERNMENT?

<P>
 When Bonnie Barnett opens her mouth to sing, as she will at the Ventura City 
Hall on Saturday night, you're never quite sure what's liable to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 She tends to push her voice into sonic corners most of us only dream of. She 
creates abstract tapestries of sound, deals in multi-phonic rumbles, squeals 
and makes other unusual noises that, for two decades, have linked her with both 
the avant garde and world music traditions. The Los Angeles-based vocalist is a 
brave, accomplished soul working in the unorthodox realm of "extended vocal" 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 But to hear her tell it, the term unorthodox may be a misnomer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see, all over the world, people are doing all kinds of extended vocal 
things. It's not really exotic, in a certain sense. It's very human to make all 
these strange sounds. It's just that we're conditioned by our culture to think 
that there's a narrow bandwidth of approved expression." 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt, when the Barnett Band comes to City Hall, norms will be left out in 
the cold. For one thing, there will be no music stands in the house. For 
Barnett, improvisational music has been her primary focus for several years 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett's Ventura appearance will also serve as a local representation of the 
Los Angeles new music scene, which is enjoying good health of late. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the key players will be on stage with Barnett, who says she feels 
fortunate to have them. "With the band that will be up in Ventura, for me, it 
feels very star-studded," she said. Reed player Vinnie Golia, a longtime pillar 
of the jazz that is left in Los Angeles, runs the Nine Winds label, on which 
Barnett's debut CD, "Delay in Gravity," was recently released. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Nels Cline, also a frequent and sympathetic collaborator with 
Barnett, has been hosting New Music Mondays at the Alligator Lounge in Santa 
Monica. The Monday series serves as a kind of reliable, regular oasis for new 
music in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on hand will be wind player Richard Wood, bassist Steuart Liebig, and 
drummer Billy Mintz. Mahacuisinart, Ventura's own band of mad merry makers, 
will open the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Barnett herself is one of the stars of the West Coast new music 
scene, and on more than one front. Primarily, her work is divided between 
improvisatory settings, with a constellation of musicians in Los Angeles, New 
York and Europe -- including the Swiss group The Zone -- and the unique 
Barnettian phenomena called "hums." 
</P>
<P>
 She began staging hums in 1981 and, to date, has realized 54 separate such 
"public participatory events." In them, large groups of people are instructed 
to hum, sing and otherwise drone together, creating an undulant cloud of 
droning, interacting sound which can be very hypnotic. Her hums have sometimes 
involved live radio and satellite links, "where singers in more than one city 
were mixed live via satellite." One such event took place in 1992, when she 
used videophone technology to link up audiences in Santa Monica and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm working toward three millennium hums, in 1999, 2000, and 2001. 
There's always a big controversy over when the actual millennium really is, so 
I decided to solve that by having one each year for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, the improvisational work is something that I adore. When I was in 
graduate school studying 20th-Century music, I was really into scored vocal and 
choral music. Now, the stuff that really interests me is the improvised 
interaction between players." 
</P>
<P>
 After studying 20th-Century music at the University of Illinois and at UC San 
Diego, where she got her master's degree in 1972, Barnett found herself 
increasingly attracted to music without paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came down to a question of self discovery and then finding ethnic sources 
that are alive and healthy around the world. By doing your own thing, because 
you're a human being, you are joining the big sea of vocal tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then, I felt quite isolated. But there was Meredith Monk and Joan La 
Barbara, who were inspirations. Yoko Ono was a total inspiration. If you listen 
to her double album, 'The Fly,' now, it could be put out as a brand new album. 
People have no idea that this stuff was being done in the '60s."

CENTERPIECE: LET THERE BE NIGHT; HIGH-OUTPUT LAMPS LIGHT THE WAY FOR TRAIL 
CYCLISTS WHO SEEK NEW CHALLENGES. COOL AIR AND HIGH SPEEDS COME WITH THE 
TERRITORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's Wednesday evening at the bottom of Sulphur Mountain Road. Cliff swallows 
are gulping down the final insects of the day while the last dust-streaked 
hikers and mountain bike riders straggle to the end of the popular trail. 
</P>
<P>
 As the birds settle into their nests and the daylight cyclists head home to 
supper and TV, a half dozen riders in clean jerseys chat idly in the cool, blue 
light of evening. They're waiting. Waiting for the sky over Lake Casitas to dim 
and uncover the evening star. 
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden somebody flips a switch, and it's prime time for the latest 
mountain bike trend -- night-time trail riding. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest battery-powered, high-output lamps have given mountain biking a new 
dimension, and companies that manufacture the lights, such as the Thousand 
Oaks-based Turbo Cat, report that sales double each year. Those lights are 
turning up on trails throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Cheeseboro Canyon and Ranch Sierra Vista we get a lot of night riding," 
ranger Robert Heagy said. "I'd say that on any given weeknight at Cheeseboro, 
we have 20 to 30 riders." 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of reasons for the popularity. For one, temperatures are 
cooler at night. For another, the same boring trail that you've ridden a rut in 
suddenly becomes challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Sailor, an electrical engineer from Ventura, has ridden Sulphur Mountain 
and several other popular trails at night. He enjoys the added challenge but 
also the tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the day when you stop, the sun is blazing and all the other riders are 
buzzing by," he said. "But at night it's so cool and quiet all you hear are 
crickets and the wind in the trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the motivation nobody wants to talk about -- the need for speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast moving bikes have on occasion bowled over hikers or barreled into the 
back end of equestrians. As a result, many trails have been closed to bikes, 
and those that remain open have speed limits. For all practical purposes, the 
speed limit signs come down at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically speaking, some people are riding over the speed limit," ranger 
Heagy said, "but there are so few users at night that the potential for 
collision is low." 
</P>
<P>
 Speed is the rule on Wednesdays along the county-maintained Sulphur Mountain 
Road. It's a regular club night when dozens of riders climb the well-maintained 
trail for the banzai ride back down. 
</P>
<P>
 A few, such as Tren Morris of Ventura, get to the top and wait for darkness to 
descend before heading down. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds dangerous, doesn't it? Going kamikaze down a pitch-black trail, nothing 
but a slim beam of light separating you from a disfiguring accident. 
</P>
<P>
 But veteran riders say a good light lets you descend faster and, in some 
respects, more safely than in daylight when the potential for plowing through 
an elementary school field trip is very real. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great," Morris said. "You can come up here at dusk, wait for it to get 
dark and fly back down." 
</P>
<P>
 On one such night, four riders blazed by within feet of Ventura hiker Tom 
Adam, surrounding him in a plume of dust. But despite the controversy that 
swirls between bikers and other trail users, Adam was philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go into the woods you have to watch for rattlesnakes," he said. 
"Sulphur Mountain is one of the few places where guys can ride as fast as they 
want. This is a major mountain bike trail and as a hiker, when you're on it, 
you have to watch out for bikes." 
</P>
<P>
 He added it would be thoughtful for a bicycle club to post a sign alerting 
unaware hikers to the presence of bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The after-hours absence of boot-shod pedestrians and horseback riders doesn't 
mean the trail is completely free of hoofed road hazards. The hills surrounding 
Sulphur Mountain Road are home to cattle and deer. Broadside one of these 
critters at 35 m.p.h. and you'll get more than a bent wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of anybody who's ever center punched one," Morris said on the 
way up. But on the way down, he and his wing man, Mike Gourley, also from 
Ventura, nearly notched a new experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was about six inches behind Tren's wheel and he just locked his brakes up," 
Gourley said, still breathing hard minutes after the near collision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to shout, DEER!" Morris said apologetically. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I saw was you lock up and I swerved to the left. That's when I saw it. I 
must have missed by just two feet," Gourley said. "Oh man! I'm still shaking." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the fauna are less hazardous. Turbo Cat owner Tom Robbins finds 
nocturnal wildlife one of the most remarkable things about night riding. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I ride out at Malibu Creek during the day I never see mice, but at night 
the kangaroo rats are all over the place. Really, they're thick as cockroaches. 
Then there are these strange birds, they're called night jars, I think. They 
sit in the trail until the last possible moment and flush right over your 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 Even setting aside the natural tableau, Robbins is understandably hyped about 
night riding. Sales at Turbo Cat are up 160% just through the third quarter of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fourth quarter is our biggest one. People get used to riding after work 
in the summer, then the days start getting shorter, that's when sales pick up," 
Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Nightsun -- a Pasadena company that also manufactures high-output bicycle 
lights -- sales have doubled every 18 months for the last seven years, said 
owner Tobin George. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the sales are due to bicycle commuting, but night riding is 
definitely growing, particularly at this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional generator that attached to the bike's rear wheel produced 
about three watts and you couldn't get much more power than that without 
installing a generator that looked as if it came from under the hood of a car. 
In contrast, today's lights generate as much as 40 watts, a beam luminous 
enough that bicycle commuters say cars sometimes flash their brights so 
cyclists will turn it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer demand for such portable products as notebook computers and electric 
razors greatly increased research in rechargeable battery technology, Tobin 
said. Batteries now last longer, recharge more quickly and yield more power. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins hopes research into electric cars will produce a breakthrough that 
results in a battery that is lighter and even more powerful -- and maybe 
cheaper as well. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, Dave Hamilton, part owner of Allied Bicycles in Ventura, said you 
can expect to spend $120 to $200 for a decent light set that burns two to three 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course you can ride without a light. A full moon is the oldest night-riding 
aid. Experienced riders say that if you know the trail, a full moon is plenty 
bright even for relatively high-speed descents. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring moonlight, Hamilton said, as many as three riders without lights can 
follow a leader with a strong lamp. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to get right on his rear wheel and trust him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an alternative for the budget minded: Hamilton said cyclists with 
weaker, less expensive lights riding three abreast can generate enough candle 
power to illuminate a road, but the road has to be wide enough. This is not a 
viable method for the narrow, technically difficult trails mountain bikers call 
single track. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's the diminishing access to single track that draws a fringe element to 
night riding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of guys ride out of bounds," Hamilton said. "Guys in the underground 
scene. If they've been eyeing an off-limit hill for a couple of months, they 
are more likely to get a light and do it when the ranger is at home asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like a rule of nature. Whether it's outlaw skiers snaking through the 
trees, computer hackers with modems knocking on locked electronic gateways or 
mountain bikers with lights: Mobility seeks access. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more illegal riding (at night) than I care to admit," Robbins said. 
"But you can see them a mile away and if the rangers want to catch them, they 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Ranger Robert Heagy doesn't see the growth of night riding as a 
major threat to public safety or trail preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing about night riding is that it spreads park visitors out over 
more hours," Heagy said. "I'd have to say that on the balance, it's a positive 
thing." Cyclists, Hikers Clash on Styles 
</P>
<P>
 So what's this controversy between mountain bikers and hikers? You'd think 
their common outdoor interest would create a bond, but no. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a curious trait of humans that we're most scornful of those who share 
interests similar to our own. Sailboat owners regularly lower the boom on the 
power boat crowd and fly fishermen save the sharpest barbs for their brethren 
who fish with bait. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the case of mountain bikers and other trail users the conflict is 
not without cause. It's not so much a case of environmental damage: Studies 
show that on most terrain, cycles cause as much damage as hiking boots and less 
than equestrians. It's the clash of styles (and sometimes bodies) that has 
created an uneasy relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The leisurely pace of hikers and horses doesn't mix with the 25- to 45-m.p.h. 
rate at which some cyclists descend the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 A horseback rider from Ojai who asked that his name not be used said when he 
sees cyclists speeding down the trail, he turns his horse broadside, blocking 
the trail and bringing the cyclists to a sudden halt, whereupon he lectures 
them on safety and etiquette in language that's anything but polite. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the conflict, more and more areas have been closed to cyclists 
since the first production mountain bike was manufactured in 1980. Wilderness 
areas such as the Sespe, Chumash and Matilija are among the public lands where 
mountain bikes are barred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sespe was a place that had the best this sport had to offer," said Mickey 
McTigue, author of a guide to mountain biking in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to do a ride every November starting over in the Lockwood area, ride 
to Ojai, stay overnight at the Sespe Hot Springs and next day ride out and down 
33 to Ojai. That's all changed with the wilderness across there." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, mountain bikes are excluded under a law that predates the 
explosion of all-terrain bicycles by 20 years. The Wilderness Act of 1964 
prohibits "mechanized vehicles," and even the Sierra Club, the main opponent of 
broader bicycle access, generally concedes that the language was meant to apply 
to such motorized vehicles as dirt bikes and 4-wheel drive trucks. The club 
maintained, however, that the intent of the law would have excluded mountain 
bikes from public lands. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year the Sierra Club acknowledged a difference between motorized and 
non-motorized mechanical vehicles, said George Darnes, chairman of the Sierra 
Club's off-road vehicle subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result of a conference in April with the International Mountain 
Bicycling Assn., the Sierra Club no longer opposes bicycles on public lands 
outside of wilderness areas," he said. "But we still oppose mechanized vehicles 
in wilderness areas whether those vehicles are mountain bikes, wheeled carts or 
what have you." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, cyclists and the Sierra Club have come to a much 
better agreement about mountain bikes in the back country, said Thousand Oaks 
resident Mark Langton, editor of Mountain Biking magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 That results from a concerted effort by cyclists to be good citizens when 
sharing recreational resources with other users. Consequently, the trend of 
trail closures has begun to reverse itself. 
</P>
<P>
 One more cautionary note, though. If you're a cyclist going for a ride in the 
coming months, beware of the biggest potential shared-use hazard of all: deer 
hunters. Watch out that your bar ends don't look like antlers. Night Biking

 As Banned Books Week approaches, this is the time to come clean: I once burned 
a book. Literally. It was five years ago and what I did has haunted me ever 
since. It was a very badly written novel, vicious and graphic with no 
discernible message. I'm always filling boxes with books to be given to 
libraries and used-book fund-raisers. I kept putting that book into the 
give-away box and yanking it out again. On a fateful night sitting in front of 
a fire, I did it. Watched it burn and wept. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Banned Books Week begins Saturday and many bookstores will be observing 
the event with readings and displays of books challenged and banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Smiley's "A Thousand Acres," winner of the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for 
fiction, was banned at Lynden High School in Lynden, Wash., because it was 
judged to have "no literary value" to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Ventura County, battles were waged in Fillmore over the assignment of 
Richard Wright's classic "Native Son." Some parents in Ojai sought removal of a 
high school literature text because of a story by T. Coraghessan Boyle. 
Moorpark residents wanted Theodore Taylor's book, "The Cay," removed from a 
school reading list because of its stereotypical portrayal of African 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the thousands of books certain groups want and sometimes succeed in 
getting removed from schools and libraries are "Macbeth," "The Color Purple," 
"The Diary of Anne Frank," "Little Red Riding Hood," "The Grapes of Wrath," 
"The Lorax" by Dr. Seuss and the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 And although I chose to destroy my copy of That Novel, I join all rational 
people in insisting that no book be publicly banned. We can attack the content 
of a hateful book, but we must defend its right to sit on the shelf. The 
Ventura Bookstore will offer for a $1 donation, "I Read Banned Books" buttons 
and bumper stickers supplied by the American Society of Journalists and 
Authors. Barnes & Noble's "Read In" is scheduled from 6 to 9 p.m. Tuesday.

 Some years ago, we moved into a country cottage in a remote setting, a place 
that cried out for rustic ambience. Eagerly, we filled it with pine furniture, 
natural fibers and earth tones. Mainly, we used brown, an honest, heartland 
color -- the shade of forests, soil and oat-bran. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a bit compulsively, we gathered chestnut rugs and camel upholstery, 
bronze-and-beige draperies, sepia towels, a chocolate-hued telephone, brown 
dish drainer, shower liner, soap dish and toilet brush. 
</P>
<P>
 These last few gave out, at length, and needed successors. But alas, by then 
brown decor had been wiped from the face of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Toilet brushes, you will note, are light blue, pink or almond this year; and 
consumers had better march to the beat. Why should manufacturers cater to the 
oddball tastes of throwbacks? Brown is deader than road kill. Finis. 
</P>
<P>
 Think back. Remember avocado refrigerators? Copper washers? Gold-and-olive 
sofas? Maroon bathroom tile? They're gone -- swallowed by the ooze of landfills 
like so many saber-toothed tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, future generations will ask, as they uncover these worthy treasures? 
Because their time had come. 
</P>
<P>
 Color cycles are relentless. They revolve in unswerving arcs, propelling a 
fashion hue from timid introduction through heady involvement to climax. Then, 
they carry that color into the void, leaving in its wake indifference, or 
perhaps heartbreak. But a replacement is ready to infatuate anew. 
</P>
<P>
 Is conspiracy involved? As it turns out: yes. 
</P>

 "Companies usually belong to one of a couple of different organizations of 
color marketing firms," said Sue Reynolds, interior designer at Interior Form 
and Function in Camarillo. "Car, clothing, furniture manufacturers participate; 
they forecast six months, one year, two years in advance. They say, 'We 
anticipate these colors are going to be popular."' 
</P>
<P>
 Then, she explained, members from subgroups -- housewares, floor coverings, 
whatever -- vote for their choices, and an industry palette emerges. 
</P>
<P>
 Out-voted color combinations are warehoused for awhile, then dropped; 
decorators have to work around those limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some colors cycle through faster than others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to stay away from things that look real trendy," said Reynolds. "I 
would never do a burgundy and gray office. Pretty soon you'd know exactly when 
that was done." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgundy sounded disposable enough. But shouldn't brown be around for the long 
haul? 
</P>
<P>
 Despondent over our pastel toilet brush, we took this question to the top: 
Rubbermaid. Their manager of Color and Lifestyle Trends, Andre Doxey, was 
patient. It is not a simple thing, he said, to keep a color in production. 
Where once industry may have pushed a color agenda, now it tracks the nation's 
mood, and responds wherever public favor falls. It is about to fall on hunter 
green. 
</P>
<P>
 So, dark green kitchen and storage accessories will flood the market next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started in fashion," said Doxey. "(Green) was pulled from going to the 
cabin in the woods, escaping, getting away from the everyday craziness -- the 
green grass and things of that nature." 
</P>
<P>
 The runner-up new favorite, deep blue, is attributed to the nation's love of 
denim. And other choices are identified with nostalgia for the '70s: berry red, 
and (surprise!) a shade of avocado. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the yellow-green tone is hovering in the high-end market, because the 
mainstream still has not recovered from its earlier avocado romance, the color 
specialist said. Definitely, the green will have a different name -- and, like 
other '70s repeats, a brighter tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Doxey put it, "They're not as putrid as they were back then." 
</P>
<P>
 So how long will it take before brown returns? A year and a half for 
housewares, we learned. It might have been even longer, but there is this 
current love of coffee, being followed by a passion for tea, which will drive 
the demand for tawny housewares. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about time, we thought, appeased. But right away, anxiety set in. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, after all, certain brownish products that are out of favor. Refried 
beans are getting a real bad press, right? And, what about -- gasp! -- tobacco? 
</P>
<P>
 We can see the writing on the wall -- the condensing of brown's popularity 
curve to a quick blip of fame, followed by oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we resolve to take that window of opportunity to stockpile brown 
implements for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Siege mentality? Call it what you will; we prefer to think of it as lifestyle 
insurance. There's a long dry spell coming, and this time we want to ride it 
out in style.

REEL LIFE; DR. QUINN WORKS HER WONDERS ON AGING MOVIE SET; CBS, WHICH FILMS THE 
WESTERN SERIES AT PARAMOUNT RANCH, HAS SPENT $300,000 TO RENOVATE TWO 
BUILDINGS. 
</P>

 Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman has worked her restorative powers on a couple of 
unused buildings at the Paramount Movie Ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, which broadcasts the Western series filmed on location at the ranch, 
ponied up $300,000 to renovate two buildings. Park spokesperson Jean Bray said 
one structure, the "Longhorn" building, was built by Paramount in 1927 as a 
commissary. It was renovated as office space for the use of the production 
staff during the next five years, the term of the CBS agreement with the park. 
The second building is a barn built in 1900. It will be used for scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Like renters anywhere, CBS will have to leave improvements behind when the 
lease is up. The buildings will revert to park service use when "Dr. Quinn" 
ceases production. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1927, Paramount Pictures purchased 2,700 acres on the southern end of the 
sprawling Rancho Las Virgenes, and judging by the variety of films shot there, 
you'd think chaparral was the most common type of vegetation on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 It was China for "Adventures of Marco Polo," colonial Massachusetts for "Maid 
of Salem," and Missouri for "Adventures of Tom Sawyer," Wales in "How Green Was 
My Valley" and France in "The Man From Wyoming."

 A retrospective of the work of artist and independent filmmaker Harry Hurwitz 
goes on display Sunday at the Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Featured along with 30 years of drawings and lithographs is a miniature film 
festival including "The Projectionist," and "Eternal Tramp," a 1965 documentary 
on Charlie Chaplin narrated by Gloria Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurwitz produced "The Projectionist," a story about a daydreaming 
projectionist who imagines himself a super hero. It was Rodney Dangerfield's 
film debut. Another Hurwitz film, "Fleshtone," is available on pay per view. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurwitz has works in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carnegie Art Museum is at 424 South C St. in Oxnard. The show runs through 
Nov. 20.

 Haven't heard enough about crime lately? 
</P>
<P>
 A mini-documentary on violent crime in Ventura County is set to air on cable 
stations Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence in Our Backyard," is a half-hour program written and produced by 
Westlake resident Kelly Daniels. Daniels, a free-lance television reporter and 
producer, used $3,000 and the help of many friends in the television business 
to complete the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary focuses almost exclusively on youths committing crimes, 
including the slayings of Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan and Simi Valley 
student Chad Hubbard.

JAUNTS; RANCHO SIMI TRAIL BLAZERS LIKE MIXING WORK WITH PLEASURE; THE GROUP'S 
FIRST PRIORITY IS BUILDING AND MAINTAINING THE NATURE PATHS. BUT THEY ENJOY 
TREKKING, AND SCHEDULE REGULAR OUTINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The hikers who make up the Rancho Simi Trail Blazers didn't pick their name 
justbecause it was cute and snappy. Sure, they like to hike, but they actually 
build trails and maintain them too. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has existed officially for a year now, and they've attracted some 40 
members. During that time they finished one trail segment and have since 
tackled another. 
</P>
<P>
 They got their start when the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District 
appealed to the community for help with its network of trails in the Simi area, 
according to Lisa Klockenteger, vice chairman of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district didn't have the funds to maintain the trails or the money for 
new trails to be cut," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the group has built the new Hummingbird Trail, a half-mile stretch 
at the north end of Kuehner Drive along the eastern edge of the city. 
Eventually they hope to extend it into the Chumash and Rocky Peak trails. 
</P>
<P>
 For now they're working on another trail, this one a longer project called the 
Stagecoach Trail that will run over Santa Susana Pass, connecting Simi Valley 
with the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all their hikes are free, membership in the Rancho Simi Trail Blazers 
runs $10 a year, or $15 for a family. For that, members get a newsletter 
detailing upcoming hikes and projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the grueling work, they still manage to hike often. Members meet for 
five- to six-mile treks around Simi Valley late in the afternoon on Thursdays 
and Sundays. On Saturdays they car-pool to a hiking spot, usually outside the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 This Saturday they plan to take a 5 1/2-mile hike out of Rancho Sierra Vista 
park in Newbury Park. They'll car-pool from Simi Valley to the park where 
they'll head for "the old cabin site," as it is called on the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area map. 
</P>
<P>
 The cabin, once used by cattlemen working for Rancho Sierra Vista, burned in 
1956 during a fire that swept through the mountains, leaving only the rock 
chimney. The route, listed as strenuous on the map, cuts across grassy meadows, 
then zigzags over switchbacks taking hikers near a seasonal waterfall before 
reaching the cabin site. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has other Saturday outings planned. The weekend of Oct. 1 and 2, 
they will backpack to the Sespe hot springs for an overnight. On Oct. 8 they 
plan to hike Sissar Canyon above Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thursday and Sunday hikes are more spontaneous. "We don't decide where we 
will go until we're all there," Klockenteger said. "They're kind of a 
potpourri." 
</P>
<P>
 Anywhere from five to 15 people show up for the group's hikes, she said. If 
the turnout is large, they might split into two groups to allow slower hikers 
to take their time. They have young families with babies in backpacks and a 
number of people in their 60s. 
</P>
<P>
 When they work on trails, they know what they are doing. Some members, such as 
Klockenteger, have gone through a one-day class on how to cut trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just start hacking," she said. They learn things like how to build 
the trail so that water drains properly and trail maintenance is easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go out there with hand tools and cut and hack a four-foot-wide trail," she 
said. "We don't use anything motorized. It's all sweat." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, the trails they build are accessible to a multitude of users: 
hikers, bicyclists, equestrians, even wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have to climb over any rocks," she said. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Rancho Simi Trail Blazers hike. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Rancho Sierra Vista park in Newbury Park. (Take the Wendy Drive exit 
off the Ventura Freeway and go south. Turn west on Potrero Road until you come 
to the park at Pinehill Street). 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday. To car-pool, hikers should meet at 7:30 a.m. at the rear of 
Jack's Restaurant, Royal Avenue and Madera Road, Simi Valley. Hike begins about 
8:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Bring a quart of water and a snack. The trail to the "old cabin site" 
is not well marked, so it is wise to hike it with a group such as the Trail 
Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 * ETC.: For the regular Thursday (6:30 p.m.) hikes and the Sunday (5 p.m.) 
hikes, hikers meet at the west end of the Ralph's parking lot at Los Angeles 
Avenue and Sycamore Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * INFORMATION: 520-1470.

FOR THE KIDS; ENTERTAINER IZZI JUGGLES JOKES WITH TALL TALES; THE LIVELY 
PERFORMER BRINGS HIS MAGICAL ACT FOR YOUNG AUDIENCES TO THE NEW FORUM THEATRE 
AT CIVIC ARTS PLAZA.

 Izzi Tooinsky can juggle almost anything -- torches, knives, hatchets -- even 
whatever he might find in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's a lot more than a juggler. He spins stories and jokes around with 
kids. In fact, diversity is his thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK to be different," he usually tells his young audiences. He should 
know. He is only 5 foot, 2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at me. I'm different," he tells them. "I'm a little guy. I'm going bald. 
My mom, she was nothing like Barbi." 
</P>
<P>
 Tooinsky will be doing his thing, or things, Saturday in a 2:30 p.m. 
performance at the Forum Theatre in Thousand Oaks' new Civic Arts Plaza. 
Tickets are $7 and $9. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is the first of the season for the Ventura County Children's 
Festival. Director Brian Bemel has been bringing family entertainment to the 
county for nine years. Tooinsky's show in the Forum Theatre is one of the first 
performances in the intimate setting, which seats up to 400. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never quite know what I'm going to do," Tooinsky said about the upcoming 
show during an interview from his home near Lake Tahoe. "I have to feel the 
pulse of the audience. But there is certain to be a lot of audience 
participation." 
</P>
<P>
 He might recruit a kid to beat a drum periodically for emphasis during one of 
his magical, mystical, sometimes ridiculously silly tales. Ask him his story 
and he might say he was lost in a dark Albanian forest as an infant and taken 
in by hamsters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Albania part is true anyway. He was born there, leaving with his family 
when he was 5. He spent most of his youth in the Los Angeles area. He picked up 
juggling from his grandfather who had been a traveling performer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tooinsky took his own act to Venice Beach, where he became a street performer 
for many years. "I saw I could carry on an ancient tradition," he said. Since 
then, he has performed worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 38 and the father of two, Tooinsky's comic storytelling style has been 
compared to everyone from Robin Williams and Cheech Marin to Hans Christian 
Andersen. Ask him, and he'll say he's a cross between Isaac Bashevis Singer and 
Jimi Hendrix. His theme of diversity is one, he says, that can be applied to 
adults as well as kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lifelong lesson. It's OK to be different. That's what I was saying to 
myself all the time, and I realized I was not alone." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Disney recording artist Craig Taubman is the season's opener for the Conejo 
Valley Children's Concert Series. Taubman, who plays some supercharged rock 'n' 
roll with his four-piece band, will also be performing at the Forum Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 His shows are at 5 and 7 p.m. Thursday. Advance tickets are $6.50; $7.50 at 
the door. For ticket information, call 493-4348.

SHOPTALK; A CHILD'S MAGIC KINGDOM NEED NOT COST A PRINCELY SUM; BY AVOIDING 
SOME OF THE TRADITIONAL OUTLETS, YOU CAN LOWER THE PRICE OF CURING THE WORST 
CASE OF DISNEY MANIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Ask any preschooler to tell you about his or her favorite Disney character and 
you'll be amazed to hear a litany as long and complex as that of the Hapsburg 
Empire. Ask any parent of a preschooler about his or her child's fascination 
with all things Mickey and you will be amazed to hear an adult speak in 
intimate terms about characters with names like Simba, Nala, Jasmine and 
Flounder. Disney mania has preschoolers in a frenzy for "character" toys, 
clothes, tapes, books and even underwear! 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic Kingdom does not come cheaply, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when purchased from Disneyland or any of the Disney retail stores. 
So we've scoped out the sources with lower prices on all your favorite 
character gear. For holiday or birthday gifts for preschoolers, these Disney 
items can't be beat. 
</P>
<P>
 First, let's take a look at what hooks our kids on Disney mania: the movies. 
Classics like "Jungle Book" and "Peter Pan" are re-released only once every 
seven to 10 years and then made available for purchase for a short period of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Disney has had mega-hit after mega-hit with such new films as "The 
Little Mermaid," "Aladdin" and this summer's blockbuster, "The Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 We can purchase these films, when available, at the Disney Store for $19.99 or 
we can go to Price-Costco where the same videos are usually available for 
$14.99. (Attention shoppers, "Snow White" will be available Oct. 25 for a 
limited time.) 
</P>
<P>
 Price-Costco also has a great selection of Disney character play sets, which 
are like little theaters where your child can create stories with characters 
and scenes from different Disney movies. For $11.49 you get two play sets, with 
three characters in each, in play and carry cases. At the Disney Store, one of 
these play sets is $10. Another kid fave is the "Golden Sound Story Book." 
These books are $12.99 at Price-Costco, $19.95 at the Disney Store. Disney 
Story Book Classics, which sell for $6.98, are $3.79 at Price-Costco. 
</P>
<P>
 Target is another great source for Disney at a discount. Clothing is 
especially plentiful here. Look for everything from "The Lion King" 
Velcro-closing sneakers ($12.99) to Princess Jasmine pant-sets for girls in 
poly-cotton ($13.98). And don't underestimate the power of 101 Dalmatians 
underpants to toilet-train your toddler. Packs of three panties by Fruit of the 
Loom or Hanes are $5.99 at the Disney Store. At Target the same brands are 
$3.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Little girls love to play dress-up in frilly nightgowns that have Belle or 
Jasmine on the front. They'll run $6.99 to $12.99 at Target. T-shirts are 
another popular item. At Target, most character Ts are 100% cotton and priced 
at $6.48. That's compared to $10 to $14 at the Disney Store. 
</P>
<P>
 Target's toy department had lots of fun Disney stuff too. We liked the set of 
seven (of course) Dwarfs for $8.69 and the Beauty and the Beast Play-Doh 
Playset for $9.97. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sav-on we found more of the coveted items. There's bubble bath in 
character-shaped containers for around $6. Winnie the Pooh shampoo is $3.99. 
And of course lunch boxes by Aladdin Industries with Mickey, Minnie, Snow 
White, Aladdin and Belle for $6.29. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few things that are better purchased at the Disney Store. For 
example, we'd rather spend $16 on a cotton sweat shirt than $9.88 for the 
poly-cotton one at Target. The stuffed animals also seem closer to character at 
the Disney Store than do the Mattel versions at Target. But this is something 
that might matter more to us grown-ups than your own little character at home.

EARTHWATCH: SENIORS' EFFORTS TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT TURN A GRAY FUTURE GREEN; 
LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY, OLDER AMERICANS ARE HELPING TO PRESERVE THE WORLD 
AROUND THEM.

 Today in suburban Washington, D.C., a two-day national conference begins 
"linking seniors to environmental action," as the event's organizer, Tom 
Benjamin, puts it. He's chairman of the Environmental Alliance for Senior 
Involvement, which he described as a coalition of groups with programs for 
seniors who want to "conserve and protect the nation's environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of organizations as diverse as the huge American Assn. of Retired 
Persons, the small North American Coalition on Religion and Ecology and the 
ubiquitous Environmental Protection Agency will meet for two days to trade 
ideas on how to turn "grays" into "greens." 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Southern California, it turns out, something like this is already 
happening. Like other California seniors, actor Eddie Albert has been sensitive 
to green issues for decades. He has volunteered to serve as official spokesman 
for the new alliance's efforts around the country. His special concern is 
agricultural topsoil loss, but he notes a lot of other environmental risks 
facing the aging American. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is serious stuff," he told me on the telephone. "We're talking about the 
life of the human race. We should get with the groups that do things about this 
and get tough." 
</P>
<P>
 A poll last year by Senior Highlights, a Southern California-based monthly 
magazine, revealed that subscribers in our county and nearby chose Greenpeace 
as a favorite charity for donations. "(Seniors) are not a selfish group and are 
aging in a younger way -- enjoying the outdoors and looking forward to their 
future in it," said Lee McCannon, the magazine's publisher. Ventura County 
seniors in particular seem to be going beyond donations when it comes to 
environmental matters. Locally, they are creating green volunteer opportunities 
and producing the volunteers to fill them. For instance, when the city of 
Thousand Oaks needs 50 busy hands for a direct mail campaign aimed at keeping 
the town actively recycling, members of the Retired and Senior Volunteer 
Program turn out in force -- every season. The program's members maintain the 
35-acre Gregor Mendel Botanic Garden in the Conejo Valley. And the Knights of 
Columbus chapter at St. Jude's parish, whose members average age is 57, works 
throughout Thousand Oaks planting hundreds of pounds of flower seeds provided 
by the America the Beautiful Fund. Another volunteer environmental program, 
reported in a previous Earthwatch column, has placed local seniors in research 
and activist roles in locations all over the world. The EarthCorps, as it's 
called, is operated by a Boston-based organization, which has, entirely by 
coincidence, the same name as this column. One feature of their program, which 
has proven rather attractive to seniors, is that the travel costs and certain 
other expenses connected with EarthCorps volunteerism are tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Another motivator for senior involvement in ecological issues is real estate 
value: Many seniors are homeowners and quite aware that they can't get lots of 
cash equity out of a house next to a landfill or along a smoggy boulevard. 
Also, modern seniors are living longer and spending more time outdoors. Who 
wants to jog or golf in smog? According to the latest actuarial figures, a 
60-year-old can look forward to almost 20 years of senior living. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a future that folks that age didn't used to have, according to Dr. John 
T. Gruppenhoff, director of the National Assn. of Physicians for the 
Environment. He also notes that seniors are medically at high risk from smog 
and other toxins, and psychologically disturbed "about the increasingly 
polluted environment we are leaving as a legacy to our children and 
grandchildren." Details

ON THE ROAD: PROFITING FROM THE ART OF PERFECT PENMANSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ernest Charrow spent a lifetime selling printing to tiny businesses and huge 
corporations throughout Los Angeles. Cards, stationery, brochures, pamphlets, 
you name it -- on the road, selling, selling, selling. He'd come west from 
Brooklyn, N.Y., to do it. That was 47 years ago. Retirement was 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the wife," he says of Berdie Charrow, to whom he has been married for 65 
years, "well, she saw this ad in the paper in 1981. We were living in Thousand 
Oaks. The ad was for calligraphy courses at the senior center. I thought: 
'Right. Never. No way.' But I was sitting around, retired and 78." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a printer, always a printer -- something about ink in the veins. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teacher threw me out of the class within a week," says Charrow. "I knew 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher may have solved one problem by creating another. Within two weeks, 
Charrow was teaching his own classes in calligraphy. 
</P>
<P>
 He would do that for most of the 1980s, in senior centers in Thousand Oaks and 
Ventura. Whereupon people of all stations and ability levels would come to know 
the sometimes wry, sometimes affable, sometimes irascible, always energetic 
Ernest Charrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, come on!" he says, throwing both hands up to the sky. "Are you kidding? 
You have half a brain, I'll teach you in half an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's not in it for the teaching, it must be said. Charrow, who turns 91 next 
month, is in it for diversion and pocket money. And he's awfully good at it. 
</P>
<P>
 His office in a tidy mobile home here is lined with his best pieces. The 
entire text of Lincoln's Gettysburg address in Old English type, each character 
a matrix of painstaking strokes that run from fat and bold to razor-thin and 
delicate. The text of Mark Twain's essay, published in Harper's in 1898, on 
Jewish identity, in multiple typefaces. A placemat-ready compendium of American 
states in Roman type and their capital cities in italics. 
</P>
<P>
 The defining mark of calligraphy, whatever the font, is its sheer elegance. 
It's an elegance, too, that can camouflage mischief. In a piece titled "Old Age 
Is Hell," Charrow lends visual beauty to blunt street comedy: "The body goes 
stiff . . . you get corns on your feet big as hens' eggs . . . you'll take 
Ex-Lax at night and then you're not sure . . . liquor is out, you can't take 
the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 He spends up to three or four hours a day at calligraphy. He finds it relaxing 
and energizing at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, ever the salesman, Charrow takes it to the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were in New York," he says, "I believe I'd make a fortune with this 
stuff. Ad agencies, when they use this kind of thing, pay $500 to $1,000 a shot 
for it. Out here, the market's dead. I'm hoping to break it, but people don't 
really think of paying for this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Computers may have something to do with that fact, though Charrow's work is 
evidence enough that real calligraphy, like any real art, bears the texture, 
the micro-jitter, the imprint of the hand that moves the pen. That's a 
sentiment best expressed in another of Charrow's pieces: "Calligraphy, the 
Orphan of Artistry." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly knows from the real thing. His office called Charrow 
recently and invited him to do 150 nameplates for a fancy dinner. Charrow was 
excited at the prospect until compensation, or the lack of it, was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Charrow suggested that the two-day job was not part of his civic duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "What, I work for nothing?" he asks in amazement. "Maybe him, with the 
$130,000 salary, he should work for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Charrow is certainly a guy who has never worked for nothing. He may 
have left the sales routes of Southern California, but in retirement he has 
retooled for another life of commerce and activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "How else do you keep going?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem Charrow himself might answer that, as his fitness and vitality 
are as striking as his calligraphy. He attributes this to luck and, negating 
all poetic testimony about old-age abstinence, laughingly notes that he has a 
double shot of vodka before dinner every night. "Yeah, and I have another 
before bed," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, Charrow is getting away with something, and even he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 If art reveals the man -- and perhaps contains his mysteries, as well -- 
Charrow will be on full display this November at Oxnard's Carnegie Museum. 
There, the best of his work will be shown. "And available for $5 a copy," he 
notes, winking. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone doubting Charrow's ability and tenacity had best seek out the adage he 
committed to paper in 1994: "Beneath the rule of men entirely great, the pen is 
mightier than the sword."

MUSIC; MOODY BLUES JUST KEEP ON GROOVING IN HARMONY; FOUR-FIFTHS OF THE LINEUP 
FROM 1966 WILL BE AT THE SANTA BARBARA BOWL ON SUNDAY NIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Moody Blues, with four-fifths of the lineup from 1966 still at it, will 
bring their cosmic consciousness and heavenly harmonies to the Santa Barbara 
County Bowl on Sunday night. For sure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moodies were one of the first bands to connect rock to classical music 
with their landmark 1967 pop opera release, "Days of Future Passed." Well, the 
future is now, because the Santa Barbara Symphony, overdressed and 
overwhelming, will be there to back up the band. Let's see the Grateful Dead, 
Pearl Jam, Snoop Doggie Dogg or the Chili Peppers try that one. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Hayward is the blond having lots of fun, who over the years has played 
guitar and sung and written lots of cool songs, such as "Tuesday Afternoon," 
"Nights in White Satin," "Question," "Never Comes the Day," "The Story in Your 
Eyes" and plenty more. He spoke by phone from a Salt Lake City hotel, where he 
was disguised as one Mr. Sandy. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the symphony connection come about? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it happened in September, 1992. It was a concert in Red Rocks, Colo., to 
commemorate the 25th anniversary of the release of "Days of Future Passed." It 
was filmed and they played it on PBS and all over the world as well. Then we 
started getting calls from all over with people asking us to play with their 
symphony orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there anywhere the band hasn't been? 
</P>
<P>
 We've never been to South America. We'd really like to go there, but we've not 
had the right offer yet. We've never been to Russia, but we were in Prague when 
the Russian tanks rolled in. The Russian generals came and took some of our 
rooms, and we ended up five guys to a room, three to a bed. We left on a 
British Air Force plane after being there for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the '60s, every British band was a blues band. Was that true 
of the Moody Blues as well? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we started as an R&B band until we developed our own style, but I don't 
think that phase was reflective of ourselves. We were then very much a 
small-time band close to folding . . . and all of us had moved back home with 
our parents. We had an opportunity to record but without a record contract, and 
we recorded "Days of Future Passed," which originally was meant to be a just a 
stereo demonstration album. But then it took off in France. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What was it like being a rock star in the '60s, or can you remember? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you know what they say about the '60s. It was like being a member of an 
exclusive club. London in the '60s was surely the place to be -- the clubs were 
cool and all the musicians knew each other. It was a golden age, obviously 
looking back, led by the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 The band has gone through keyboard players every 10 or 15 years. There's no 
keyboard player now? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh no, we've got two now, Bias Boshell and Paul Bliss; they've played on our 
last few records. Mike Pinder left a long time ago, which was a great release 
for the rest of us because it's difficult when someone doesn't want to do it 
anymore. He lives in California somewhere. Patrick Moraz? I don't know where he 
is. We didn't kick them out, they both left us. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you think Moody Blues music is like? 
</P>
<P>
 I think you can rely on us to go our own way and make music from the heart and 
the head. We just trust our own judgment, but that's getting more and more 
difficult these days with accountants running record companies. 
</P>
<P>
 What does everyone always get wrong about the band? 
</P>
<P>
 It's that people always assume that we're some sort of psychedelic weirdo 
hippies stuck in that thing. We've had a lot of success in the '80s with a 
couple of big hit singles, which has changed our audience considerably. These 
days, you know, it's hard to get 45-year-old hippies to go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like you guys and the Stones -- how do you account for the band's 
longevity? 
</P>
<P>
 We've overcome a lot of crisis points that broke up a lot of other bands. 
</P>
<P>
 When we broke up in 1973 for a few years, people thought it was a mistake, but 
it was probably the best thing we ever did. I discovered I didn't have a life 
apart from music and the band. When you're young, you expect people to want to 
come to see you; but when you get older, you realize it's a privilege that 
people still want to see you. Also, I'm in a band that plays my songs really 
well, and the money is really good. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '70s, was there an extra weight on the band because the fans 
expected the band to provide The Cosmic Answer to It All? 
</P>
<P>
 It was definitely a time of search for enlightenment and also a big party. 
Then it became a serious search for enlightenment with a background of 
rebellion, especially in your country, against the war. At that time, I think 
we knew more than our fans. We were always singing from experience -- a lot of 
religious and psychedelic experiences. But the search was always the same, to 
make the world a better place. Personally, I did all my growing up by the time 
I was 15; I mean I wrote "Nights in White Satin" when I was 19. Details

 Top chefs team up to form culinary organization and to prepare special monthly 
dinners. Some of Ventura County's top chefs last week teamed with some of the 
best from Santa Barbara County and one from Malibu to form the Central Coast 
Culinaire Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Local association members include Sandy Smith of Rosarito Beach Cafe 
(Ventura), Yvan Lampron of Ojai Valley Inn (Ojai), Randy Saito of the Hyatt 
Westlake Plaza (Westlake Village), Gael Lecolley of Wheeler's Hot Springs 
(Ojai), Francois Milet of The Tower Club (Oxnard), Anthony Gillespie of 
Pastabilities (Camarillo), Kevin Sherrie of Las Posas Country Club (Camarillo), 
Ted Growi of L'Auberge (Ojai) and Brian Barker of McCarthy's (Camarillo). 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 members of the CCCA, organized by Robert Lopez, general manager of The 
Tower Club, will share ideas, and on a monthly basis team up to prepare 
four-course meals for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of camaraderie among them, no jealousy," Lopez said. "They just 
want to have fun and let the people of Ventura County know who they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said each month a different chef will host a dinner at his or her 
restaurant, and the others will pitch in. Chefs will rotate from table to table 
during the meals to meet with the guests. Cost of these dinners will be $65. 
</P>
<P>
 The first joint dinner will be held Tuesday at The Tower Club, with only Tower 
Club members invited. After that, the meals will be open to the general public, 
so stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chefs association member Randy Saito and his Hyatt Westlake staff of 26 cooks 
this month have begun to offer an International Lunch Buffet at the hotel's La 
Terraza restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Each weekday from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. cuisine from a different region of the 
world will be featured, with menus changing periodically. The lineup is 
American food on Mondays, Mexican on Tuesdays, followed by Asian, Italian and 
South Pacific/Caribbean fare. Cost is $7.75, down from the previous $9.75 
buffet price. The Hyatt is located at 800 S. Westlake Blvd.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; LAID-BACK SETTING OF THE OJAI VALLEY OFFERS LUNCH TREATS 
WITH A KICK; CHOICES RANGE FROM SAVORY DISHES AT SUZANNE'S TO FRENCH COUNTRY 
FARE AT L'AUBERGE AND ZESTY PIZZAS AT BOCCALI'S.

<P>
 It's still warm up in the hills of the county's backcountry, in the sheltered 
valley that the Chumash Indians called Ojai, the nest. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Southern California's summer winds down and fall approaches, we start 
thinking about places that hold the promise of a lovely lunch after a short 
drive. The Ojai Valley immediately springs to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us enjoy the mid-summer heat of the valley so much that we head up in 
July or August and grab a table on an outdoor veranda or terrace. Over an icy 
beer or a bottle of chilled wine, it's both sensual and relaxing to gaze out 
over the dry California landscape and toward the mountains ringing the valley; 
to luxuriate in the warmth, peace and tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of these lunches -- if sophistication and consistently excellent 
preparation are the criteria -- come out of the kitchen at Suzanne's Cuisine. 
Suzanne's building, on Ojai Avenue as you come into downtown from the west, is 
nothing out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 But once seated in the lovely patio at the rear, you can't help but notice the 
enticing dishes being served to fellow patrons. They fit pretty well with the 
gentle sounds of the garden fountain and the sage-like aroma of the California 
plantings. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne's ceviche seafood salad ($9), a dish of raw, fresh fish, maybe salmon 
or halibut or sea bass, marinated in lime juice, and served in a salsa of lime 
and lemon juices with jalapenos, cilantro and other herbs, delivers spicy 
flavors to the tongue. The fish is firm but not tough, and the melding of 
flavors is just right. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the juiciest, messiest, most succulent fish sandwich, the grilled 
halibut ($8) is unbeatable. The gently broiled fish is served on rich, coarse 
nine-grain homemade bread, with lettuce and tomatoes and -- this is the 
clincher -- a superb homemade mayonnaise with fresh dill and capers. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are luscious treats and include rich, yet crisp, sorbets, in flavors 
ranging from kiwi to apricot. 
</P>
<P>
 Just off the main drag, in an older house on a corner, is the venerable 
L'Auberge. Admittedly, there are many who might think this country French menu 
is a bit heavy for a warm day. But the rear veranda, with swirling overhead 
fans and views across the oak and pepper trees and up the Topa Topa bluffs, is 
a lovely one, and a bottle of chilled Piesporter easily mitigates the heat -- 
even if the waitress does occasionally forget to keep the bottle on ice. 
</P>
<P>
 At L'Auberge, one dish of choice would be a small bowl of steaming, cheesy 
onion soup gratinee ($5), and perhaps a plate of fish pate ($6.50). Or try the 
cold cream of chervil soup ($4). The main dish here is always a big one, such 
as the hefty omelet ardenaise ($8.75), stuffed with ham, onions, mushrooms and 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Out on the other end of town, amid citrus groves at the foot of the Dennison 
grade, sits a small, wooden-framed restaurant called Boccali's. In this 
pastoral setting, patrons eat outside at picnic tables under Budweiser 
umbrellas, twisted oak trees overhead and mountains rising nearby. Or there are 
tables inside, in a decor dominated by red-and-white checkered oilcloth. 
</P>
<P>
 Boccali's pizza crusts -- a bit bread-like -- do tend to get heavy on the 
edges, but the toppings are excellent. You can add anything from crab to garlic 
or go for the basic cheese model ($8.95, 14 inches). The shrimp and the chicken 
chunks come moist and tender. And don't forget the garlic bread -- some of the 
best around ($2.25) -- thick and chewy, with Parmesan cheese and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemonade, freshly squeezed, is a drink of choice here, but pizza does seem to 
cry out for either the Michelob or Millers on tap. Details

SCHOOL'S NEW UNIFORM PLAN GETS HIJACKED; EDUCATION: STUDENTS ARE DELIGHTED BUT 
PARENTS ARE DISHEARTENED BY DELIVERY PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THE THEFT OF TRUCKLOAD 
OF THE OUTFITS. 
</P>

 Somewhere out there -- and you know who you are -- someone is sporting the 
bottom halves of the school uniforms that were supposed to have adorned the La 
Mesa Junior High School student body. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been nearly a month now since the black, white and teal uniforms 
were hijacked from their delivery truck -- and that's only one of the reasons 
the Santa Clarita school has been forced to put its new mandatory uniform 
policy on indefinite hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, announced two weeks into the school year, was greeted with 
disappointment by parents -- and glee by most of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great, because (the uniforms) are stupid," said seventh-grader Nick 
Dunkle, 13, who attended school Wednesday in a decidedly unofficial ensemble -- 
an Orlando Magic T-shirt and olive green shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the adults were less pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say morale has dropped, enthusiasm for the program has dropped 
because of the delay," said La Mesa Principal Rochelle Neal, one of the main 
proponents of the uniform program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected some initial hurdles, but I did not expect this kind of delay." 
</P>
<P>
 La Mesa was supposed to begin the year as the first and only school in the 
William S. Hart Union High School District to have a mandatory uniform program. 
</P>
<P>
 But a series of foul-ups -- ranging from the hijacking to a series of computer 
and other problems -- have delayed delivery from the vendor, Sunland-based 
Cherokee Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Singer, president of Cherokee's uniform division, said the robbery 
occurred Aug. 29 when three men hijacked a truck containing about 9,000 
uniforms for various schools, including La Mesa, as it was leaving a sewing 
factory in Montebello. The hijackers forced the driver to lie on the floor of 
the truck and blindfolded him, releasing him in Long Beach after taking his 
money and the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truck's been recovered, but none of the uniforms were recovered," Singer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other problems have plagued the uniform company, including 
processing breakdowns that caused further delivery delays. Singer also 
acknowledged that the firm is considering restructuring under Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of these problems, only a handful of the 500 students enrolled at 
the new school have received their uniforms -- which have been already paid 
for. Some others have gotten just a shirt, skirt, pair of slacks or other part 
of an outfit. The cost of the uniforms -- which include several sets of clothes 
-- is $100 to $150 a year per student. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said the company has been supplying institutions with uniforms since 
the early 1980s, but this is its first year in the school uniform business. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will be attending a meeting of La Mesa's parent advisory committee 
tonight to explain his company's position. 
</P>
<P>
 But although Singer expects Cherokee to have worked out its shipping problems 
and have the uniforms delivered to La Mesa next week, district officials and 
parents were skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt they should have managed it better," Sukhinder Rana said. "We paid the 
money, and they told us the uniforms were ready. I've been calling (Cherokee) 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, only a handful of students at La Mesa are wearing uniforms.

PRIVATIZE WORKERS' COMP SYSTEM, WACHS URGES CITY; GOVERNMENT: L.A.'S 
SCANDAL-PLAGUED CLAIMS SETUP WASTES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, THE COUNCILMAN SAYS. 
PROGRAM'S SUPERVISOR SAYS THE PLAN IS PREMATURE.

<P>
 Saying that bureaucrats have allowed reforms to languish for too long, Los 
Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs on Wednesday proposed that a private firm 
take over the city's dysfunctional and scandal-plagued workers' compensation 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs scheduled a hearing for early next month to begin discussions of his 
plan, which would remove the handling of worker injury claims from the city 
Personnel Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's workers' compensation system has been under increasing fire since 
early this year. A mayoral task force in May estimated that the city spends $32 
million more a year than it should on worker injury claims. In June, a 
high-ranking Personnel Department official was accused of heading a ring that 
bilked the city out of nearly $1 million in fraudulent claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Thelma Bowman, a principal compensation analyst, was fired and is under police 
investigation for allegedly conspiring with doctors and private investigators 
to defraud the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times report showed that the workers' compensation system for years had 
remained impervious to change, despite repeated warnings from auditors inside 
and outside city government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's workers' compensation system is scandalous," Wachs said Wednesday. 
"It is totally out of control. The administration of the system simply has to 
go to the outside. That will save tremendous sums of money." 
</P>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle also urged faster action to reform the workers' 
compensation system, although he did not endorse Wachs' call for an outside 
firm to take over the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said the improvements are urgent because auditors have found the 
Workers Compensation Division books in such disarray that they could not even 
say how much liability the city might face. Without corrections, the city's 
bond rating could suffer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could cost the taxpayers more when we go out to borrow money, if we don't 
take appropriate corrective action," Tuttle said. "It's important to get 
reforms done." 
</P>
<P>
 Faye Washington, who took over as head of the Personnel Department this year, 
said that Wachs' proposal is premature and that she is moving ahead to clean up 
the workers' compensation program. A consultant has been hired to redesign the 
system and another outside firm has been hired to begin reducing a caseload of 
40,000 claims -- which is the equivalent of nearly one claim for every 
municipal employee. Many are outdated files susceptible to overbillings if not 
closed, audits have shown. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has said she would like to have another outside firm handle some of 
the workers' comp claims, to test whether it can do the job more efficiently. 
But she said it is premature for the city to divest the entire program. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are doing is more prudent than just blatantly reallocating the 
function," Washington said, adding that she would take very aggressive steps to 
cut workers' compensation costs. The city paid out $86 million for worker 
injuries and related costs in 1992-93, more than 2 1/2 times the amount of a 
decade earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs acknowledged that Washington has done more than past administrators. But 
he said that in-house reform efforts inevitably have proven "piecemeal and 
wimpy and designed to mollify the critics, not to make real change." 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs' Governmental Efficiency Committee will discuss the issue Oct. 5. The 
City Council has a standing policy requiring that public hearings be held 
before any city function is turned over to a private firm. A hearing has not 
yet been set.

DISHING IT OUT; COVERAGE: TV STATIONS TRAINING THEIR ANTENNAS ON THE O.J. 
SIMPSON CASE HAVE CREATED A VERITABLE 'MEDIA CITY' ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE 
COURTHOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A small makeshift town has arisen in a parking lot across the street from the 
Criminal Courts Building -- complete with high-rises, crammed parking, portable 
toilets and rifts between neighbors. Though it has no government or major 
controversies of its own, it will soon be the most visible "city"' in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 This town within Downtown is the new "media city" where the major television 
networks and smaller stations coming into Los Angeles to cover the O.J. Simpson 
murder trial will make camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The location, next to the former Los Angeles County Jail, is where network 
hotshots such as NBC's Tom Brokaw and teams of special "O.J. unit" television 
journalists will be putting together everything from live coverage of the 
proceedings during the day to instant specials at night. NBC alone has 12 
experts and national correspondents covering the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the live reports by the networks will come from towering platforms 
surrounded by uncertain-looking scaffolding that will offer a clear shot of the 
court building where the trial is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
 Finishing touches were being completed Wednesday even though the four networks 
and local stations were still uncertain about their plans for the trial. Under 
consideration are plans to rotate the coverage among the networks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the networks seem to be leaning against the gavel-to-gavel coverage 
they provided during Simpson's preliminary hearing. Coverage of that proceeding 
cost ABC, CBS and NBC an estimated $1 million each in lost advertising revenue 
and alienated many soap opera fans, even though the daytime ratings 
significantly increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "CBS obviously lost money during the preliminary hearing, but that's not 
what's driving our decision-making," said Lane Venardos, who is in charge of 
the network's coverage. "This trial, unlike the preliminary hearing, is 
expected to last for months, and there will be times when it is riveting and 
times when it is tedious." 
</P>
<P>
 Network officials said they will probably provide live coverage all day when 
the testimony is considered important. On other days, they may go live briefly 
without preempting the daytime schedule. Every day, officials said, they plan 
to provide at least some live updates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be several days during the trial -- opening and closing arguments, 
testimony by Simpson and other important witnesses -- when it's clear we'll be 
live all day," said David Bohrman, the NBC News executive in charge of special 
events coverage. "Those are about five days when you know you have to be there 
gavel-to-gavel -- but how many more will there be? That will have to be decided 
as we go along." 
</P>
<P>
 Local and independent stations said they may make a decision Friday about 
rotating the coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 However, CNN and Court TV plan to provide live, gavel-to-gavel coverage. The 
ratings for both increased substantially during the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to have some OJ-o-meter to measure our ratings," said Court TV 
spokesman Lloyd Trufelman. "If the trial lasts for months, we'll be there, as 
we were with the Menendez trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the uncertainty, the "town" seemed to be in full swing Wednesday. 
Court hearings on Simpson and alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss were taking 
place simultaneously across the street in the Criminal Courts Building, along 
with a news conference by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
announcing that it would not file child molestation charges against superstar 
entertainer Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Long trailers were filled with technicians, editors, writers and producers 
watching complicated banks of TV monitors, video reporters, sound equipment and 
control boards. Camera operators rushed here and there. Outside, workers toiled 
on finishing 30- and 40-foot-tall scaffolding towers belonging to CBS, CNN and 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Fox, executive director of the Radio-Television News Assn. of Southern 
California, a professional organization that is coordinating the television 
coverage, said the media city has become a community unto itself. "We've got 
Dumpsters, we've got 600 telephone lines, we've got Porta Potties. It's the 
most complicated setup we've ever done. We've done everything for them but 
cook, and I told them I'm not cooking," she quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the establishment of any town is impossible without disagreements 
over property and territory, and insiders indicate that the new "media city" is 
no exception. They said NBC built its towers highest because it wanted to have 
a higher vantage point and better view than other stations. There was also a 
report that ABC was trying to exclude Fox from using a broadcast platform, 
saying it would be reserved for the networks that had a Washington bureau -- 
which Fox does not have. Fox has reportedly threatened legal action, but 
officials declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox and others denied that there was any disarray at the makeshift city. 
"Everyone is getting along," CBS producer Sally Garner said. "There's no 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is still uncertainty over how the networks will cover the 
trial, there is no doubt among executives that viewer interest is high, even in 
light of recent world events such as in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could make a case for it and against the attention it's getting," said Bob 
Furnad, in charge of special events coverage for CNN. "Haiti is what people 
need to know about; O.J. Simpson is what they want to know about."

BILL BOYARSKY: THE SPIN; HOW PUBLICITY ROBS TRAGEDIES OF MEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There was enough news in the Criminal Courts Building Wednesday to overwhelm 
even the most sensation-seeking reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 9th floor, the prosecution and defense fought over evidence in the O.J. 
Simpson trial. Nine floors above, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti was making an 
announcement to the world press that Michael Jackson wouldn't be prosecuted for 
child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in a courtroom on the 13th floor, a handcuffed, pale Heidi Fleiss 
heard that the beginning of her trial was delayed. Her eyes were dull. Her thin 
face was tortured. The alleged madam to the stars looked strung out. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the reporters, engaged in covering the Simpson and Jackson cases, 
missed her appearance. But there in Judge Judith L. Champagne's courtroom, more 
than in the other places, it was possible to sense the human tragedy that marks 
every day in the Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching Fleiss made me think about how the media shape the public's 
perception of criminal cases, how it can depersonalize those who get tangled up 
in the criminal justice system and how the crush of reporters and cameras can 
shift attention away from the very tragic and important lessons found every day 
in the court system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, Fleiss, awaiting federal and state trials on pandering, drug 
and tax evasion charges, was right up there in the high-publicity class. She 
was a star of the tabloids and tabloid TV shows, just as Simpson and Jackson 
are today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heidi we met through the media then was a movie-of-the-week character, a 
tough-as-nails, wisecracking L.A. woman-child with a black book filled with 
famous names from all over town. She had beaten the system, according to the 
media myth, and enjoyed a great L.A. life. 
</P>
<P>
 Her appearance in court Wednesday suggested something completely different. 
Fleiss was more pathetic than anything else. Her face, gaunt even in her golden 
days, hinted at the drug use that led to her arrest last Thursday. She was 
jailed for violating her bail terms after tests showed she had used stimulants 
and antidepressants. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two cameras and a few reporters tracked her appearance in court 
Wednesday. As she sat at the defendant's table next to her lawyer, Fleiss 
looked alone, abandoned, just another defendant facing drug and prostitution 
charges, the same as hundreds of other women confronting the same accusations 
in the criminal courts every day. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of the media occupied elsewhere, the hype was gone and I could see 
Fleiss as a human being.  
</P>
<P>
 I also saw the undistorted realities of domestic abuse in a case that preceded 
Fleiss' and that drew no media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Lidio Rios pleaded guilty to the felony beating of his small child. Under a 
plea bargain, he was placed on five years probation, ordered to serve a year in 
the County Jail -- minus time already served, plus credit for good behavior. 
That means he'll be out in 242 days. 
</P>
<P>
 I wondered about the mother and the child. When the man gets out of jail, 
he'll be forbidden to go within 100 yards of the child. He also was ordered to 
take parenting classes. 
</P>
<P>
 How is the overloaded county probation office going to enforce that? And what 
if he violates parole, and harasses the mother and child? Will the cops rush to 
the rescue of a frightened woman who can only speak Spanish? I imagined the 
fear the mother will feel when the man is freed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere was completely different when the press gathered in the 
district attorney's office for Garcetti's announcement on Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti was late. "I'm looking at a noon deadline and I'm sweating," a 
tabloid show reporter told the D.A.'s press secretary, her voice reflecting the 
crisis mode in which we journalists operate during such situations. 
</P>
<P>
 When Garcetti arrived, all sense of order was wiped away by the shouted 
questions of reporters immersed in tabloid journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 At their core, regardless of guilt or innocence, the Jackson and Simpson cases 
are tragedies. But the unprecedented publicity surrounding them has robbed them 
of meaning and humanity. I do this for a living, but I was disturbed by it.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TRIAL OF 
ACCUSED MADAM FLEISS LIKELY TO BE DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Wednesday granted a request that will probably delay next week's 
scheduled start of reputed Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss' trial on state drug 
and pandering charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Judith Champagne approved a defense request allowing the 
trial to begin within 15 days from Monday.Fleiss' attorneys sought the 
extension, citing personal scheduling conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial had been scheduled to begin Monday in the same courthouse and on the 
same floor as the high-profile O.J. Simpson murder trial, which is to begin 
jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, 28, was arrested last year for investigation of pandering and drug 
possession after an undercover sting by police. She has pleaded not guilty to 
the charges, which carry a maximum prison sentence of 12 years. Prosecutors say 
Fleiss ran a call girl ring catering to wealthy businessmen and Hollywood 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate case, Fleiss and her pediatrician father, Paul Fleiss, face 
federal charges of tax evasion and money laundering. Their trial is scheduled 
to begin Dec. 6. The two are accused of depositing checks for prostitution 
services into his bank account and lying about income from such services and 
other matters on their tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss was arrested last week for testing positive for drugs -- a violation of 
her pretrial release in the federal case. Authorities said the tests revealed 
methamphetamines and Valium. Fleiss' mother attributed the test results to 
asthma medicine. On Monday, a judge ordered Fleiss to enter a live-in drug 
treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Donald B. Marks, said she has been accepted into Impact House, a 
130-bed facility in Pasadena. He was uncertain when she would move into the 
center.

IN KILLING OF LIQUOR STORE CUSTOMER

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators on Wednesday were seeking a man who argued with a 
Carson liquor store employee, then returned with a handgun and sprayed the 
business with gunfire, killing a customer. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday at 2721 E. Carson St., said 
sheriff's spokeswoman Benita Hinojos.  
</P>
<P>
 "About 20 minutes before the shooting, the suspect had a dispute with an 
employee (of the business)," Hinojos said. "He left and returned and fired 
randomly into the store."  
</P>
<P>
 Jose Carbajal, 23, of Torrance, died at the scene, Hinojos said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COVINA; COUNCIL VOTES 
TAX SIMILAR TO ONE THAT LED TO OUSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, Covina voters recalled the entire City Council for passing a 6% 
utility tax and replaced it with an anti-tax council. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, the new council voted 4 to 1 for an 8.25% utility tax, saying 
that without a tax, the city's $2.3-million budget shortfall would require 
closing the library, parks and recreation department and a fire station, and 
the layoff of 77 city workers. 
</P>
<P>
 We were right two years ago," said former Councilman Chris Lancaster, who was 
among the five recalled in July, 1993. The earlier 6% tax had been allowed to 
expire in October, 1993. "I guess when you recall a City Council and put in a 
new one, you get an extra 2.25% utility tax." 
</P>
<P>
 The tax, which will remain in place for five years, is expected to be about 
$185 a year for an average household, or the equivalent of one month's utility 
bill, City Manager Fran Delach said. The 6% tax proposed last year would have 
cost an average of $151 per household, or $12.60 per month, according to city 
officials.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: EL MONTE; 3 ARRESTED IN 
SLAYING OF 16-MONTH-OLD GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities arrested three alleged gang members Wednesday in the shooting 
death of a 16-month-old girl caught in gunfire in South El Monte last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The toddler, Maureen Nicole Ramirez of El Monte, was shot in the head Aug. 29 
as she sat in her stroller on the porch of a South El Monte home.Two men were 
wounded in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and El Monte police served search and 
arrests warrants at homes in El Monte at 7 a.m. and arrested Cesar Uribe, 18, 
Omar Colin, 21, and a 16-year-old boy, sheriff's spokesman Matthew C. Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth suspect, a juvenile, was already in custody on a probation violation, 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Nicole was shot about 9:30 p.m. when two men in their 20s walked up to 
a Sastre Street house where the child's mother, who had been walking with her 
three children, stopped to chat, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men opened fire with semiautomatic weapons and fled on foot. Romero 
Castellanos, 31, and Jessie Medina, 23, were wounded during the shooting. They 
were treated and released from a hospital after the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were being held without bail at the Temple City sheriff's station 
on suspicion of murder. Sheriff's Lt. Don Bear said he was especially pleased 
to have suspects in the case, adding: "This one kind of tugs at your 
heartstrings."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 WORLD WAR II SHIPS IN 
BITTERSWEET RENDEZVOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For one ship and its crew of mostly ancient mariners, it was the 
near-culmination of a longtime dream, the final leg of a triumphant voyage into 
the past. For another ship and its crew of equally ancient mariners, it was a 
bittersweet consolation prize, a chance to savor at least a small portion of 
the glory that might have been theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The two ships, both of them painstakingly restored World War II merchant 
vessels, are the 442-foot Liberty ship S.S. Jeremiah O'Brien, whose home port 
is San Francisco, and the 455-foot Victory ship S.S. Lane Victory, based in San 
Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The crews of both ships, composed primarily of retired merchant seaman in 
their 60s and 70s, had planned to sail their renovated vessels to Europe last 
spring for the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings on the Normandy coast of 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 The O'Brien, which participated in the D-Day invasion a half-century ago, made 
it to Europe. But the Lane Victory did not, being forced to turn back in early 
May after developing engine trouble near Acapulco, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the O'Brien steamed into Los Angeles harbor for a rendezvous with 
the Lane Victory after completing all but about 400 miles of its five-month, 
19,000-mile voyage to the Normandy beaches and back. After spending a day and 
night tied up bow-to-stern at the docks in San Pedro, both ships steamed out of 
Los Angeles Harbor on Wednesday morning bound for San Francisco and a gala 
homecoming for the O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 The O'Brien's 56 crew members -- who range in age from a 22-year-old volunteer 
to 90-year-old Clarence Rocha, a retired San Francisco longshoreman -- were 
exuberant.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was beautiful, no problems of any kind," said O'Brien Captain 
George Jahn, 79. "It's a good ship and a good crew." 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned 70 on this trip but I feel like I'm 18 years old again," said 
retired U.S. Maritime Service Rear Admiral Thomas J. Patterson, another World 
War II veteran who served as coordinator for the O'Brien's visits to ports in 
England, France and both U.S. coasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The O'Brien had been scheduled to rendezvous with the Lane Victory near 
Bermuda for the trip across the Atlantic Ocean last spring. Like other O'Brien 
crew members, Patterson said it was a sad day when they heard that the Lane had 
been forced to turn back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It broke my heart," Patterson said. "I have as much pride in that ship as I 
have in this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Lane Victory crew members said they were happy to be able to take part in 
the O'Brien's San Francisco homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted for them," said Joseph Vernick, president of the U.S. 
Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II, which owns the Lane Victory, as he 
mingled with O'Brien crew members aboard the ship Tuesday in San Pedro. "It's a 
great event for two ships like this to sail together." 
</P>
<P>
 But some veterans of the Lane Victory's aborted D-Day voyage were bitterly 
disappointed that they weren't celebrating the end of a European voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have been there, too," said former Lane Victory Captain Steven 
(Bill) Tilghman, 77, who unsuccessfully fought the Lane Victory governing 
board's decision to stop the voyage after the engine troubles off Mexico. "That 
(voyage) was something unique, something we'll never have a chance to do again. 
I wouldn't have cared if we'd sunk, as long as it was on the way home." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lane Victory and the O'Brien are scheduled to sail into San Francisco Bay 
together on Friday morning.

COMPTON TO CREATE OFFICE FOR RACIAL CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly two months of simmering racial tension between blacks and 
Latinos, the Compton City Council has agreed to create an Office of Human 
Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino activists had requested a human relations office that would deal 
exclusively with Latino concerns. City Council members, however, decided that 
the office should be concerned with all ethnic groups after Samoan residents 
complained about possibly being excluded, council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes sought by Latinos -- including a tougher affirmative action plan 
and creation of a civilian police review board -- were delayed or met with 
strident objections during a sometimes acrimonious meeting Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than two hours in the pre-council meeting workshop, Latino activist 
Pedro Pallan had mixed feelings on what was the first meeting between city 
leaders and the United Coalition of Compton. "Well, I'm optimistic," said 
Pallan, president of the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino coalition was formed after a videotape, depicting a black police 
officer beating a Latino teen-ager July 29, was released to the media. The 
tape, repeatedly broadcast on local television stations, sparked several 
demonstrations in front of City Hall last month by Latinos who accused the city 
of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 The harsh words of those protests left some city officials, almost all of whom 
are black, with lingering bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council, the personnel board and everybody here is being accused of 
discriminating against Latinos," City Clerk Charles Davis said before storming 
out of the workshop. "I think you're trying to intimidate this council, and I 
think it's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' reference to the city's personnel board reflected the major focus of 
tension between the two groups: perceived racism in the city's hiring 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members presented officials with statistics, put together by the 
city for a federal commission, showing that since 1986 the number of Latinos in 
the city's work force has hovered around 10%. During the same period, blacks 
have held about 78% of the jobs. Between the 1980 and 1990 censuses, however, 
Compton's black population dropped by 21% and the number of Latinos rose by 
131%. City officials now estimate the Latino population at 51%. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Paul Richards countered with his own statistics showing 
that Latino employees outnumber blacks working for some city contractors and in 
many of the area's shopping plazas. That comparison angered most coalition 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're mixing red apples with green apples," Pallan said. "We're talking 
about public and private institutions. They're different." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Omar Bradley also became upset during the exchange, saying, "If you 
don't want to give us credit where we have made strides, then you're not 
negotiating in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's promise to revise its 20-year-old affirmative action plan to 
include target dates by which more Latino employees should be hired was put on 
hold by the council after both sides said they needed time to study the lengthy 
document. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes sought by Latinos, such as creation of a civilian police review 
board and a request that the coalition be given the power to appoint members to 
the city's boards and commissions, met with strident opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Marcine Shaw said she was unwilling to give up her "hard-earned 
right" to make appointments, which are made only by the council. Then Shaw and 
other council members objected to a police review board, largely because the 
coalition said the board should have the authority to discipline police 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband was a police officer," Councilwoman Jane D. Robbins said. "So you 
know I'm not going to be happy with that."  
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Human Relations was reluctantly agreed to by coalition members 
and unanimously approved by the council. Both sides agreed to meet again, in 
hopes of finding common ground on some of the lingering issues.

AIDS GROUP MOVES NEEDLE EXCHANGE TO PRIVATE SITE; HEALTH: ACTIVISTS WHO WERE 
BLOCKED BY CITIZENS ARRESTS DURING STREET CORNER HANDOUT WILL USE PARKING LOT 
OF GAY AND LESBIAN CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seeking to silence neighborhood opposition to a grass-roots needle exchange 
program, Los Angeles AIDS activists agreed Wednesday to distribute clean 
needles to drug addicts on private property in Hollywood instead of on a street 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Clean Needles Now received permission from a Hollywood gay and 
lesbian center to hand out the needles in the parking lot until they can find a 
better location for the exchange, city AIDS coordinator Ferd Eggan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggan said city officials were hopeful that the change of location would end a 
dispute with Hollywood residents who placed several activists under citizen's 
arrest at Cosmo Street and Selma Avenue last week for breaking a state law that 
prohibits needle exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this means that in fact the story has come to a happy ending," Eggan 
said. "If everything calms down the program can return to serving the people 
who desperately need help." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the Hollywood residents said they were pleased that Clean 
Needles Now agreed to move the needle distribution site, others said they 
wanted the exchanges halted.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday evening, a half dozen of the residents gathered on the corner of 
Cosmo Street and Selma Avenue to protest Clean Needles Now's efforts. Across 
the street group members quietly handed out maps to drug users seeking their 
new distribution site located several blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 By 7 p.m., an hour into the program, about 50 drug users had picked up clean 
needles at the gay and lesbian center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is the exchanges are still illegal," said Simon Lockwood, one of 
the residents protesting the exchange. "What is really happening here is the 
citizens are saying, 'Enough is enough.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We can no longer afford to be tolerant. We cannot afford to look the other 
way. Hollywood has become the red-light district of Los Angeles. This is the 
last straw. We have to recapture our community." 
</P>
<P>
 But Joe Shea, president of the Ivar Hill Community Assn., said he was willing 
to look the other way as long as the exchanges were not conducted on street 
corners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to reach a compromise," Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two years, members of Clean Needles Now have been violating state 
law by distributing clean needles in Hollywood and other locations throughout 
the city as a means of reducing the transmission of AIDS through contaminated 
syringes. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few months ago, most residents were unaware of the group's activities. 
However, after a local newspaper disclosed where the exchanges were conducted, 
residents groups vowed to stop the activities. 
</P>
<P>
 As a show of support for Clean Needles Now, Mayor Richard Riordan two weeks 
ago declared the AIDS epidemic to be a local state of emergency. The 
declaration directs the Police Department to make enforcement of the needle 
exchange law a low priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials have said that the needle exchanges were already a low 
priority, but they must respond when residents lodge complaints or make 
citizen's arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Noelia Rodriguez, Riordan's press deputy, said she was hopeful that moving the 
exchange to private property would end some of the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping at least to be able to see a program implemented that will 
reach the people who need the services," Rodriguez said. "Certainly it is the 
mayor's desire to have responsible needle exchange program."

COUNCIL OKS LAST-DITCH QUAKE AID COMPROMISE; RECOVERY: PLAN FOR SENIORS AVERTS 
A BATTLE BETWEEN VALLEY AND SOUTH-CENTRAL LAWMAKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday approved a last-minute compromise to 
distribute quake funding for senior citizens, narrowly averting a turf battle 
that had been brewing between lawmakers from the San Fernando Valley and those 
from South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents Hollywood and surrounding 
areas, still harshly criticized her colleagues for two recent instances of 
divisive arguments over earthquake funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm increasingly disturbed by the notion that there has to be a 'we' and 
'they' in our disaster recovery plan," she said. "I think that shows a real 
failure of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 A clash over the allocation of $2.2 million in federal grants had loomed since 
last week, when three Valley council members, acting as the council's Ad Hoc 
Committee on Earthquake Recovery, recommended increasing funding for Valley 
senior citizens and slashing funds for South-Central Los Angeles communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The move angered South-Central Los Angeles lawmakers, who said senior citizens 
in those communities need help recovering from the quake even though their 
neighborhoods did not suffer the heaviest damage. 
</P>
<P>
 On the recommendation of Councilman Joel Wachs, the council voted 11 to 1 for 
a compromise plan that boosts the funding for the Valley and South-Central Los 
Angeles with surplus money intended for use during the second year of the grant 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really hopeful that this will balance the recognition that the Valley 
has great needs and the recognition that there are seniors in need throughout 
the city," said Wachs, who represents parts of the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants will be used to help relocate senior citizens from damaged homes, 
pay for repairs and provide legal assistance and transportation, among other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's compromise was good news for Evelyn Knight, the executive 
director of the People-Coordinated Multipurpose Senior Center in the Crenshaw 
district. Under the compromise motion, her center gets $140,000 instead of the 
$75,000 that was proposed by the earthquake recovery panel. 
</P>
<P>
 She said some of the money will pay staff to help senior citizens apply for 
federal and state emergency assistance. "We have a lot of people who are frail 
and unable to get through the various bureaucracies," she said after the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a full-blown turf war was avoided at Wednesday's council meeting, 
there was some bickering, making it the second time in as many months that 
Valley and South-Central Los Angeles council members have clashed over quake 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, whose Northridge-based district was hit hardest in the 
quake, cast the sole dissenting vote, arguing that the money should be 
distributed based on severity of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous squabble over quake funding was ignited last month when 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents parts of South-Central Los 
Angeles, led a move to cut the Valley's share of $47 million in housing funds. 
Instead, he recommended that funding should be increased for low-income housing 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas angered Valley lawmakers when he engineered the switch while 
three Valley council members were absent. At a subsequent meeting, and in the 
presence of the Valley members, the council reversed itself and restored the 
full Valley allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the compromise said it is fair because it disburses the money 
more evenly and they lauded it for derailing a major funding feud. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Hernandez, who represents part of East Los Angeles, said 
seniors in his district have not received their fair share of city services for 
more than 20 years and should get a portion of the funding even though quake 
damage was not extensive there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still looking forward to the day when every Angeleno is treated the 
same," he said.

COUNTY FIRE DEPT. ENDS BAN ON PLAYBOY MAGAZINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Fire Department has quietly dropped a two-year effort 
to ban Playboy and other magazines featuring nude or skimpily clad women from 
firehouses, drawing praise from free speech advocates and criticism that the 
county is risking sex harassment lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting next week, the department's 2,390 male firefighters and 11 women will 
be permitted to quietly read any publication in most areas of a firehouse, 
including the bathroom, dormitory, kitchen and common living room. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sexually explicit materials will be forbidden in areas used by the 
public, including the office and the area where firetrucks are kept. 
</P>
<P>
 "Non-consensual sharing," loosely defined as physically or verbally flaunting 
sexually explicit publications, will be prohibited in all areas of the 
firehouse, a department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy was drawn up after a federal judge struck down a 1992 
department order that forbade firefighters to read or possess Playboy in 
firehouses. The department appealed the ruling earlier this summer, but 
recently decided to withdraw the appeal after concluding that the higher court 
was unlikely to overturn the judge's decision, county attorneys said.  
</P>
<P>
 The new rules were drawn up by a task force of female and male county 
firefighters, including Capt. Steve Johnson, the Antelope Valley-based 
firefighter who sued the department to lift the previous ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "I view this as a First Amendment victory for both sides," said Johnson, a 
27-year veteran stationed in the northwestern Antelope Valley community of Lake 
Los Angeles, where there are no women firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ludicrous that possession of Playboy constitutes sexual harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Female firefighters, two of whom publicly supported the ban and two of whom 
testified against it, refused to comment on the new policy. But the 
department's decision not to return to court dismayed some members of Women in 
Fire Service, an international professional group. Women make up less than 2% 
of the 250,000 firefighters nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Introducing any magazine of that sort into the workplace sexualizes 
relationships that should not be sexualized, and makes it more difficult for 
men and women to relate," said Terese Floren, the group's executive director. 
"We would have liked to have seen a ban like this be an option for every 
employer sincerely trying to stop sexual harassment in the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 As the loser in the lawsuit, the county must pay the plaintiff's legal bills. 
Attorneys for Johnson and Playboy are seeking $300,000, an amount that could be 
substantially reduced in negotiations, county attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman supports the new policy, but with 
reservations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the court really put us in a Catch-22," Freeman said. "We're still 
responsible for creating a non-hostile work environment, but the order limited 
our ability to accomplish that."

IRVINE COMPANY'S RUDDER DEVICE IS TESTED FOR ROLE IN USAIR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal air safety investigators came to an Irvine aerospace company Wednesday 
to begin testing a rudder control mechanism to see whether it might have played 
a role in the Sept. 8 crash of USAir Flight 427. 
</P>
<P>
 The rudder and the mechanism that controls it were being investigated because 
the Boeing 737 made a wild left turn as it approached the Pittsburgh airport. 
The rudder is the portion that moves left or right on a plane's tail to make it 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests at Parker Bertea Aerospace, which manufactured the mechanism, was 
just one of several simultaneous probes to find possible causes of the crash 
that killed all 132 people aboard.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are testing all the control surfaces of that aircraft," said Ted 
Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board. "It's 
something you have to examine because of the nature of the accident. You have 
to examine anything that might indicate a (cause of) the loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Separate teams were also investigating other possible causes of the crash, 
such as weather conditions and errors by the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 The rudder's movements are controlled by the mechanism known as an actuator -- 
a device about the size of two car batteries placed end to end that 
hydraulically turns the rudder. Parker Bertea has made thousands of them over 
the years in factories in Irvine and Ogden, Utah, including most of the ones 
used in commercial jetliners, spokeswoman Cheryl Morosco said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal safety testing was being conducted at Parker Bertea's customer 
support facility, she said, where used equipment is often brought for 
evaluation. The company, a division of Parker Hannifin Corp. in Cleveland, has 
several facilities in Orange County and about 1,800 employees here. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Parker Hannifin said it had paid a total of $7.8 million to settle 
a federal claim that Parker Bertea overcharged the government on 70 contracts 
in the 1980s. The company said in a statement that it voluntarily reported the 
overcharging back in 1987 when it first came to light in an audit and that a 
subsequent federal review found additional overcharging.

NEWS ANALYSIS; NME'S HOSPITAL TALKS MAY ATTRACT SOME UNINTENDED BIDDERS TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 National Medical Enterprises may have set in motion a blockbuster hospital 
industry merger, but the Santa Monica firm may not be in control when the 
pieces fall into place. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one possible scenario that could result from NME's negotiations to 
become the nation's second-largest operator of acute care hospitals by 
acquiring Nashville-based HealthTrust Inc. and American Medical Holdings of 
Dallas, industry executives and analysts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of such a powerful merger may attract competing bidders, 
analysts said, including action by Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., currently the 
nation's largest hospital chain. If NME were to complete the deal, it would 
create the only U.S. health-care firm whose size would rival Columbia/HCA, with 
$10 billion in revenue and about 200 hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe that Columbia/HCA is not going to try to botch this deal up," 
said an executive at a large hospital chain not involved in the negotiations, 
who did not want to be named. Analysts also speculated that another hospital 
chain, such as Nashville-based Ornda HealthCorp., might step in to spoil NME's 
three-way deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia/HCA could scuttle the deal by offering to buy one or more of the 
three hospital companies. However, some analysts said Columbia/HCA could be 
deterred by the task already before it: digesting a flurry of recent 
acquisitions of hospitals, outpatient clinics and other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal may also be too expensive for Columbia, said Margo Vignola, an 
analyst at Salomon Bros. "I don't think Columbia is interested in any one of 
them at the prices they might want," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Columbia/HCA's headquarters in Louisville, Ky., declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if no competing bids emerge, NME still faces several obstacles in 
completing the deal, analysts said. HealthTrust, which operates about 118 
hospitals, may hold out for a higher offer from NME, analysts said. NME is 
expected to propose acquiring HealthTrust in a 2-for-1 stock swap that would be 
valued in excess of $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The transaction is relatively attractive to American Medical and NME, but 
less attractive to HealthTrust," said Edwin Gordon, an analyst at Morgan 
Stanley. "The linchpin to this transaction is HealthTrust. NME will have to 
come up with more money to do this deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "A deal is going to go down," said an executive at one hospital chain that has 
held merger talks with some of the parties. "But NME will definitely have to 
open up the purse strings and pay more for the companies," said the executive, 
who declined to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Other industry executives said NME may have endangered the deal by allowing 
news of the negotiations to leak out on Tuesday. Some officials of American 
Medical and HealthTrust blame NME for the disclosure and have said privately 
that the leak calls into questions NME's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the negotiations were originally disclosed in an article in the 
Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. The newspaper said its information came 
primarily from copies of different drafts of a speech that had been prepared 
for NME Chairman Jeffrey Barbakow to deliver at the firm's annual meeting on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a high-stakes gamble for this to get leaked," said a hospital 
executive who declined to be named. "It could be a deal buster for someone to, 
purposefully or inadvertently, leak this information at a fairly critical 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the rumors circulating at NME's headquarters in Santa Monica and the 
other companies is that NME deliberately leaked the documents to the newspaper 
to propel the negotiations to a conclusion in time for NME's annual meeting, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting comes three months after NME paid $380 million to settle federal 
criminal-fraud charges and pleaded guilty to six counts of paying kickbacks for 
referrals of Medicare patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said there is uneasiness among employees at both American Medical and 
HealthTrust about being swallowed by NME because of its past troubles. The leak 
reinforced negative impressions of NME, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This keeps that NME taint," said one of the hospital executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation was that Barbakow wanted to have good news for shareholders after 
the messy federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Jeff desperately wanted was a howitzer to shoot off at the meeting and 
what he was going to have instead was a pop gun," said a source close to NME. 
</P>
<P>
 But NME denied that management knew about the leak. "There has been 
speculation that NME has somehow orchestrated this, and that notion is 
absolutely untrue," said Diana Takvam, an NME spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 An NME source said the company is considering asking some employees who may 
have had access to the Barbakow speech to submit to lie detector tests. Takvam 
declined to comment on that possibility.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: IS 'JOBS' A 4-LETTER WORD FOR I-WAY PLANNERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a small world, after all. So Vice President Al Gore has taken his 
enthusiasm about the (pick one) Information Superhighway, I-Way and Infobahn on 
the road and is now selling it overseas. Rebuilding America's information 
infrastructure isn't enough, asserts the Administration's technology czar: This 
planet needs a new Global Information Infrastructure (GII). 
</P>
<P>
 "President Bill Clinton and I believe that the creation of a network of 
networks, transmitting messages and images at the speed of light across every 
continent, is essential to sustainable development for all the human family," 
the vice president proclaims in a just-published op-ed piece for the Financial 
Times, one that echoes a speech he gave in Buenos Aires last March. "It will 
bring economic progress, strong democracies, better environmental management, 
improved health care and a greater sense of shared stewardship of our small 
planet." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore's GII Manifesto -- which calls for technical collaboration between the 
industrialized nations and developing countries, as well as targeted loans for 
telecom network development -- is filled with worthy sentiments and ideals. But 
the article was more remarkable for what it didn't say. It was missing that 
vital four-letter word that most savvy politicians, including President 
Clinton, adore: J-O-B-S. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of jobs will an investment in a GII create? 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs in Bangladesh and Brazil and Budapest, perhaps, but not jobs in 
Bakersfield, Boston and Birmingham. Peel away the romance and sentiment of the 
"It's a small world, after all" vision of a GII and you have an infrastructure 
that's better designed to export American white-collar jobs than American goods 
and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Information-intensive industries can be "hollowed out" just as quickly, just 
as easily and just as traumatically as their manufacturing brethren -- 
particularly if the right infrastructure is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one can argue that the basic function of telecommunications networks 
has been to make distance irrelevant. To the extent a GII succeeds, we have 
succeeded in creating an infrastructure that facilitates the mass export of 
American jobs. And it's not just the data-entry tasks that the intelligentsia 
dismiss as scut work. Rather, it's the very knowledge-intensive jobs that allow 
white-collar workers to live lifestyles they feel they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 What goes around comes around. Make no mistake: The GII will become a medium 
for bringing low-wage competition to America's high-paid knowledge workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Silicon Valley may be the world's largest producer of computer software but 
the second largest is Bangalore in India. Software engineers there -- many 
superbly trained -- do state-of-the-art programming for less than a quarter of 
Palo Alto-type pay. What happens to American wages and employment when a GII 
makes it a snap to bid out a software development project in Bangalore or 
Budapest? 
</P>
<P>
 A surgeon may have to be physically present to operate, but why wouldn't a 
California HMO consider sending its X-Ray and CT Scan imagery overseas by 
satellite to a group of highly trained but comparatively cheaper group of 
radiologists who've decided to move to Barbados for the lifestyle? Why wouldn't 
an aerospace firm outsource component design to engineers in China via the 
network? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, this kind of intellectual outsourcing is happening anyway. 
Private enterprise has an economic incentive to invest in networks that enable 
outsourcing. Competitive global companies are looking to manage the cost of 
their knowledge work force just as ruthlessly as they sought to manage the 
labor cost of blue-collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it good public policy to try to accelerate this process through a GII 
initiative? It's one thing to remove barriers to free trade; it's quite another 
to accelerate the development of the infrastructure that facilitates the 
evaporation of good jobs before we have a better sense of what will take their 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Is white-collar GII "shock therapy" the way for this economy to go? Or should 
we focus more on the NII before we go global?  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there should be no doubt that new infrastructures will create new 
jobs -- including many better ones. But how many for how much? Will a GII 
create quality jobs faster than it exports them? A Gore spokesman says 
forecasts on these questions are in the works. However, America's own 
experiences with technology in the workplace should make it clear that these 
new media sometimes annihilate as many white-collar jobs as they create. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we are a more productive nation, but that productivity is attained at a 
traumatic cost in employment. Is it in America's best interest to accelerate 
the trend? 
</P>
<P>
 "The point here is that facilitated communications, like facilitated 
transportation, has always led to increased trade for everyone," says a White 
House spokesman. ". . . We have to stay one step ahead of the competition 
because these things are happening regardless -- now or five years from now -- 
with or without a GII. We are looking at the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the point here is that promoting free trade and economic development 
around the world is a good thing. The problem -- which our vice president has 
yet to explicitly address -- is just what kind of standard-of-living costs the 
GII would create before America began to reap the benefits. To talk about 
global "economic development" without addressing the challenges posed to the 
American work force is disingenuous, a marriage of bad policy to bad politics.

WITH THE LEGAL CLOUD LIFTING AND MUSIC AS THE ONLY CERTAINTY IN HIS CAREER, 
MARKETING EXPERTS TELL MICHAEL JACKSON:; DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and CHUCK PHILIPS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This summer, Michael Jackson's lucrative celebrity endorsement career went 
down the drain in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200,000 bottles of a Michael Jackson fragrance had to be destroyed 
because few retailers wanted them on their shelves amid the lengthy 
investigation into child molestation allegations against the performer. "It was 
somewhat of a fiasco," said Paul Rogers, president of Spectrum Innovating 
Marketing, whose ill-fated effort to sell the Jackson fragrance began before 
the investigation became public. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the cloud of the 13-month probe clears with prosecutors declining to 
file charges, the armchair advice for Jackson from marketing and music 
executives is pretty basic: stick to music and forget fragrances and other 
tie-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives believe that one strong album can put the singer back on 
top of the pop charts, and that he will remain an international concert draw. 
"I wish Michael was signed to my company," said Warner Music USA Chief 
Operating Officer Doug Morris. "He's a brilliant artist who has fans all over 
the world. (His next) record is going sell like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 But they are equally convinced that Jackson's days as a top celebrity endorser 
-- earning staggering sums such as an estimated $20 million from Pepsi -- are 
over. The scandalous headlines, the nightly "Hard Copy" reports and the sick 
jokes around the office water cooler have taken such an extensive toll that 
Jackson right now is damaged goods among image-sensitive marketers, at least in 
the United States, knowledgeable executives say. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never go back to never-never land," said Spectrum's Rogers. "Anyone 
that wants to use Michael Jackson to endorse a product would have to take a 
very, very deep look into what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt his appeal to advertisers was probably waning anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 At 36 and recently married, the boyish, Peter Pan image that once enchanted 
sponsors has faded. In addition, ill-fated ventures such as a disastrous shoe 
deal with L.A. Gear that was briefly in litigation, had already made sponsors 
gun shy. Some marketing executives also believe that the public is tired of 
Jackson's eccentricities. 
</P>
<P>
 "His persona has grown tired," said marketing consultant Irma Zandl. "It was 
more understandable and appealing when he was younger. But when you turn around 
and realize he's nearly 40, the appeal isn't the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsi officials who signed lucrative deals with Jackson in the past could not 
be reached, but have previously indicated that future deals with Jackson are 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives say that image-sensitive marketers will be especially reluctant to 
risk getting involved with Jackson because he has not been formally exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors on Wednesday suggested that the investigation could be reopened if 
the boy who made the initial allegations decides to testify. In addition, 
prosecutors said the investigation uncovered two more children who claimed 
Jackson molested them, but who also did not want to testify. Regardless of the 
lack of charges, such news is likely to make parents reluctant to buy 
Jackson-endorsed products, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never say never, but I would think any company with exposure to kids 
probably would want to steer well clear of him," Zandl said. 
</P>
<P>
 She joked that the only potential sponsor she can think of is "No Excuses," 
the jeans maker famous for ad campaigns involving such media-scorched figures 
as Donna Rice and Marla Maples. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's extensive charity work could help him rebuild his image, as could 
his recent marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
 The marriage has rekindled the public's fascination with his life. Since his 
marriage to Presley, Jackson has made a point of returning to the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Jackson's career as a recording artist has suffered little since the 
controversy broke last summer, especially overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 His "Dangerous" album, which sold 6 million copies in the United States, even 
spawned a hit single ("Will You Be There") during the middle of the crisis. The 
album sold an additional 14 million copies overseas, where market analysts say 
fans have voiced little concern over the sexual molestation case. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's popularity will be tested in December, when Sony's Epic Records 
releases "History: His Story," a 30-track, greatest-hits collection with eight 
new songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts and executives at two of the nation's largest retail record 
chains said they expect the album to be another blockbuster.  
</P>
<P>
 Epic Records President Richard Griffith -- breaking Sony Music's one-year 
silence on the Jackson controversy -- agrees that Jackson's music career 
remains solid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done a lot of marketing research since this thing broke last summer and 
what we found was that once the hysteria subsided all his fans really cared 
about was the music," Griffith said. "What the research shows is that if 
Michael makes great music, his fans will buy it. And as far as we're concerned, 
it's onward and upward into the next phase of Michael's career." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic, but all the charges and the suspicion seem to have actually 
sparked interest in Michael's new work," said Pat Welsh, vice president of 
music programming at the Pollack Media Group, a prominent international 
consulting firm for radio and film. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is expected to hit the concert trail in February, marking his return 
to the stage for the first time since scrapping his worldwide "Dangerous Tour" 
last November after saying he needed treatment for an addiction to a 
painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
 No dates have been booked, but the tour will start with a string of arena 
shows in the United States and is is likely to include a European leg as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The controversy has done nothing to tarnish Michael Jackson's drawing power 
on the concert circuit," said Gary Bongiovanni, editor of Pollstar magazine, a 
leading trade journal in the concert industry. "Promoters are lined up to work 
with him and fans can't wait to see him perform." Jackson's Music Career 
</P>
<P>
 While Michael Jackson's more recent albums haven't come close in sales to 
"Thriller," he remains one of the top-selling artists of all time.

USAIR SOUNDS A RETREAT IN BATTLE OVER CALIFORNIA SKIES; TRANSPORTATION: THE 
AIRLINE SLASHES INTRASTATE SERVICE IN THE FACE OF A NEW CHALLENGE FROM UNITED'S 
SHUTTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USAir, unwilling to face intense competition from both Southwest Airlines and 
United Airlines' planned Shuttle, is effectively fleeing the busy California 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 The carrier is slashing its daily round-trip flights between Los Angeles and 
San Francisco to four from 16, effective Nov. 13, after deciding it could not 
compete with the low-cost, low-price service of Southwest and United's Shuttle, 
which debuts Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir said it will keep operating 43 daily flights to Midwest and Eastern 
cities from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Orange County, San Jose and San Diego. 
But it will close its San Francisco flight-crew base, requiring 273 pilots and 
flight attendants there to be relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, about 170 customer service and maintenance employees in Los 
Angeles and San Francisco will either have to accept transfers or be laid off, 
the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, announced Tuesday, means USAir is virtually abandoning one of 
the key franchises it acquired in 1988 when it bought Pacific Southwest 
Airlines, a quirky airline that caught the public's fancy by painting smiles on 
its jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, USAir joins American Airlines and Delta Air Lines in retreating from 
the "California Corridor" less than a decade after the trio paid a combined 
$1.5 billion to buy airlines that were dominant in California in the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta bought Western Airlines in 1987, and American bought Air Cal the same 
year. While the mergers helped Delta and American expand their overall route 
systems, the carriers were unable to retain their shares of the 
intra-California market. 
</P>
<P>
 The three retreated after concluding they could not compete within the state 
with Southwest, which claims to now have 52% of the intrastate market. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with its low costs, Southwest is adept at earning a dollar on frequent, 
short-haul routes such as those serving California cities. When USAir, American 
and Delta began abandoning several California routes in the early 1990s -- such 
as Oakland to Burbank, and Sacramento to Ontario -- Southwest swooped in and 
never relinquished them. 
</P>
<P>
 The one airline that still hopes to muscle out Southwest is giant United, with 
its Shuttle. But Southwest responded last week by announcing plans for 15 
additional flights in California. Thus, while it's questionable whether United 
will be successful, there's little doubt that the Shuttle's debut leaves little 
room for USAir or other rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 California "is already one of the most heavily served air markets in the 
country and will be even more hotly contested" with the Shuttle, said Seth E. 
Schofield, chairman of USAir, an Arlington, Va.-based carrier that focuses on 
short routes in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become a battleground between low-cost, low-fare carriers," he said. 
So USAir -- already saddled with financial woes, high operating costs and 
Southwest's incursions on its Eastern routes -- simply pulled back in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, travelers can still board USAir -- as well as American and Delta -- 
flights at most major California airports. But the passengers will most likely 
be flying out of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of going north and south (in California), we're going east," said 
USAir spokesman Bryan Enarson. 
</P>
<P>
 Enarson also defended the purchase of PSA, and said the economic problems in 
California and nationwide that led the airline industry to lose $10 billion in 
recent years also forced USAir "to relinquish a lot of the PSA routes that were 
purchased." 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts said USAir never fully exploited the benefits of the PSA 
merger, even to the extent that American and Delta improved with Air Cal and 
Western. 
</P>
<P>
 "USAir was, in my opinion, the least successful of the three carriers in 
integrating what they had bought," said Tim Sieber, research director at the 
consulting firm Aviation Systems Research Corp. in Golden, Colo.

 IRS Sets New Rules on Electronic Filing: In an effort to crack down on fraud, 
the Internal Revenue Service is requiring professional tax preparers who file 
returns electronically to submit to fingerprinting and a credit check.The new 
procedures, detailed in a 47-page regulation issued Tuesday, also require 
preparers with access to IRS computers to be at least 21 years old and either 
U.S. citizens or permanent resident immigrants. The action, intended to screen 
out preparers with criminal records and severe financial problems, is effective 
immediately. It was taken after congressional hearings spotlighted unscrupulous 
preparers who claimed false refunds on clients' electronic returns.

INVESTOR BIDS FOR 90% OF BORDEN TO DERAIL KKR OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investor Paul B. Kazarian on Wednesday outlined a plan to buy up to 90% of 
Borden Inc.'s stock for as much as $2.28 billion in a bid to derail an offer by 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazarian's investment firm, Japonica Partners, said in a letter to Borden 
Chairman Frank J. Tasco that it is interested in producing a "significant 
transaction with Borden or its shareholders" to provide greater value than 
would have been available under the KKR offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kazarian proposal, which calls for paying $16 to $18 a share for Borden 
stock, comes to $2.28 billion if the higher price were to be used to buy 90% of 
the well-known food company's 141 million shares outstanding.

 KKR has offered $14.25 a share, or $2 billion, for Borden in the form of part 
of its stake in food and tobacco conglomerate RJR Nabisco Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we have said repeatedly from the outset, we wish to act as a proactive 
white knight; and the board's determination to sell Borden mandates that the 
board accept us in that role," said the letter, received by the Associated 
Press late Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 A telephone call to Borden's New York headquarters seeking comment late 
Wednesday met with only a recorded message. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazarian's proposal, according to sources close to the negotiations who spoke 
only on condition of anonymity, offers various transaction possibilities, 
including an equity infusion of $200 million to $500 million for a 
corresponding stake in Borden. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibilities offered by Kazarian to pay for the stock included cash and the 
stock of an unnamed company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Japonica's letter was sent after Kazarian met with Borden managers for about 
three hours Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said a clause in a Borden agreement with KKR precluded Borden 
executives from discussing specifics of Kazarian's or anyone else's proposals 
short of an actual buyout offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden shares closed Wednesday unchanged at $14 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Japonica's proposal came after the offer by KKR had already met with reported 
resistance from shareholders.

EDISON EMPLOYEES FILE SUIT ALLEGING RACE DISCRIMINATION; WORKPLACE: AFRICAN 
AMERICANS' SUIT IS BEING HANDLED BY A CELEBRATED PLAINTIFFS' LAW FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Southern California Edison, for months the target of slow-moving federal 
investigations into alleged racial bias, on Wednesday was hit with a big new 
headache: a class-action discrimination suit crafted by one of the nation's 
most celebrated plaintiffs' law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles by nine African American 
Edison employees, is being handled by the Oakland law firm of Saperstein, 
Mayeda & Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm is well known for winning huge awards for consumers and employees 
with discrimination claims. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in April the Saperstein firm helped win a $54-million settlement 
from Denny's Restaurants in connection with the company's alleged refusal to 
serve African American customers. That same month the law firm snared $107 
million from Lucky Stores in a case alleging sex discrimination in the 
supermarket chain's employment practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saperstein firm's biggest windfall, however, came in March, 1992, when it 
won $250 million for women denied positions as sales agents with State Farm 
General Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 It was billed as the biggest recovery of damages ever in a case brought under 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles management lawyer William S. Waldo said the Saperstein lawyers, 
"unlike some other plaintiffs' firms, are very careful in the cases they take," 
and investigate circumstances thoroughly before embarking on a suit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit filed against Southern California Edison on Wednesday, the nine 
plaintiffs charged the giant utility with discriminating on the basis of race 
in performance evaluations, training, pay and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which also accused the company of condoning a racially hostile work 
environment, seeks unspecified damages and a change in Edison's employment 
practices. Edison denies all the charges and says it has made major strides in 
hiring and promoting minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs' charges parallel complaints that were disclosed publicly a 
year ago by a group of more than 200 African American employees of Edison and 
filed at the same time with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is continuing to review the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, a unit of the 
U.S. Labor Department, has conducted a so-called glass-ceiling review since 
June of employment practices toward women and minorities at Edison's 
headquarters in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 A company spokesman called the review a routine matter, and said that Edison 
is one of about 50 companies over the last two years that have been singled out 
for such an audit by the agency. Federal officials declined to comment, other 
than to acknowledge the Labor Department's glass-ceiling review. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Demchak, a lawyer for the Edison employees, said her clients decided to 
take their complaints to court because of the slow pace of the government 
inquiries and the company's failure to reverse discriminatory practices. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Edison has made progress in hiring women and some minorities, but 
charged that it has continued a long pattern of discriminating against blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Nelson, an Edison vice president, replied: "We've been really 
committed to increase opportunities for minorities in this company. We have a 
ways to go to achieve these things, but we're committed to doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 The company issued figures showing that 5% of its professional and managerial 
employees are African American, versus 4% in 1989. Of the company's top 20 
officers, one is black. Overall, Edison said blacks make up 7.5% of its work 
force of 17,777 people, while only 6.7% of the people living in its service 
area are African American.

 California Home Sales Seen Rising Next Year: Sales of existing, single-family 
homes in California should increase 4.5% in 1995 to 486,000 from an expected 
465,000 in 1994, according to a forecast by the California Assn. of Realtors. 
The realty group also predicted that the median state price for a single-family 
home in 1995 would increase 1% to $187,000 from 1994's projected $185,100. The 
group based its predictions on expected job growth, stable interest rates and 
increasing consumer confidence as the state pulls itself out of recession.

AUTOS; GM GROUP FORMS UNIT TO MAKE, SELL PARTS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 General Motors Corp.'s components group formed a new business unit Wednesday 
that will develop and sell parts and propulsion systems for electric and hybrid 
vehicles to car, truck and bus makers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, the first by a major auto maker, comes as GM and other car 
makers are fighting regulatory efforts in California and the Northeast to 
require the sale of electric vehicles in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is forming Delco Propulsion Systems to coordinate the efforts of 
three units heavily involved in electric vehicle research and development: AC 
Delco Systems, Allison Transmission and Delco Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an effort to meet real market demand for electric and hybrid vehicles 
on a global basis," said Ned McClurg, vice president for AC Delco. 
</P>
<P>
 The new unit of GM's Automotive Components Group hopes to sell batteries, 
motors, controllers, chargers and other components as complete systems to 
vehicle manufacturers as well as companies that convert conventional cars to 
electric power. 
</P>
<P>
 McClurg said he saw no conflict between this effort by GM's parts operations 
to develop an electric vehicle market and the company's efforts to resist 
California's mandate that 2% of vehicles offered for sale in 1998 be zero 
emission. Only electric vehicles can now meet the zero-emission standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We truly believe there will be a market for electric vehicles," he said. 
"That's a different issue than whether a mandate is the way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 J. Byron McCormick, managing director of Delco Propulsion, said that GM sees 
great potential for electric vehicles not only in California, but particularly 
in Europe where environmental consciousness is high and some cities are seeking 
ways to reduce severe air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "This strategically positions ourselves for the European market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 GM has been considered the technological leader in electric vehicles since the 
1990 introduction of its two-seat Impact vehicle. The company said it would 
mass product the car by 1995, but backed off when financial problems forced it 
to withdraw backing for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said that many of the technologies developed for the Impact, 
which is still undergoing field tests, now will be offered to other 
manufacturers in the United States, Europe and Asia.

$24-MILLION FUND SET UP FOR RETAIL CENTERS; CONSTRUCTION: FIRMS WILL FINANCE UP 
TO 30% TO BUILD MALLS WITH GROCERS FOR UNDERSERVED AREAS OF L.A., 13 OTHER 
CITIES. 
</P>

<P>
 An investment fund providing an initial $24 million toward the financing of 
supermarket-anchored retail centers in poor, underserved areas of Los Angeles 
and 13 other cities is to be announced today by Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Henry G. Cisneros. The fund, which has received financing from four 
California companies and six others across the country, is designed to help 
community-based nonprofit organizations finance the construction of up to 14 
shopping centers at an aggregate cost of $80 million to $90 million over the 
next two years, one in each city. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund, organized by Local Initiatives Support Corp., a New York-based 
nonprofit group, would finance as much as 30% of the cost of each shopping 
center -- providing local organizations with seed money to attract additional 
investors, according to LISC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the companies initially providing financing for the investment fund are 
First Interstate Bank, Home Savings of America, Great Western Bank and Bank of 
America. Company officials were not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment fund will identify its first development site by December and 
expects to have shopping centers built within 18 months after each location is 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund has not yet identified a site in Los Angeles, but the city is a major 
priority because areas such as South Los Angeles are underserved and lost some 
supermarkets during the 1992 riots, said Susan Anderson, a Los Angeles-based 
spokeswoman for LISC. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is severe because some people in the inner city in Los Angeles 
have to travel long distances to find quality food at affordable prices," 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Los Angeles shopping center is actually a model for the kind of retail 
development LISC hopes to generate, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A nonprofit group called the Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corp. in 
1981 built a shopping center that includes a Boys supermarket at Vermont and 
Slauson avenues in partnership with Sears, a private development company and 
federal and city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the undertaking in Los Angeles would be dwarfed by plans being 
carried out by Vons Cos. 
</P>
<P>
 The supermarket chain announced in 1992 that it would spend $100 million to 
build up to 12 stores in underserved Southern California areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has already opened three of those stores at a cost of $30 million 
and says it will open another such Los Angeles store next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not charity," Anderson said. "This is a strong message that corporate 
America views the inner city as a good investment. Hopefully, this will 
encourage other corporations to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The other companies contributing to the fund include Prudential, GE Capital, 
Metropolitan Life Foundation, JP Morgan and the Philadelphia Board of Pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Established by the Ford Foundation in 1979, LISC operates in 34 locations 
nationwide and says it has helped build 50,000 homes in poor communities by 
providing financing and technical assistance.

AUTOS; SOME SECURITY FOR GM'S RELOCATED VAN NUYS STAFF?; TRANSFERS: EMPLOYEES 
AT SOLD INDIANA PLANT MAY STAY WITH THE COMPANY BY MOVING AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Score a victory -- but only a partial one -- for a wary band of veteran 
General Motors auto workers who feared that they had relocated from Southern 
California to Indiana only to be abandoned by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The worried workers included many of the roughly 85 employees who transferred 
to GM facilities in Anderson, Ind., after the company shut its Van Nuys 
assembly plant in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although initially delighted to keep their jobs, some of the workers felt 
betrayed when the company last month sold part of its Anderson operations to a 
newly formed firm. The employees feared that they would lose treasured GM 
employee benefits and job security. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, many relocated Van Nuys veterans resented the company's decision 
this spring to offer relocation packages worth up to $60,000 to coax GM workers 
still laid off in Southern California to return to work in other parts of the 
country. The former Van Nuys workers who moved to Anderson right after the Van 
Nuys plant closed received much smaller relocation packages, often worth no 
more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, details began trickling out about an agreement enabling 
the Van Nuys veterans in Anderson to stay with GM by transferring to plants 
still owned by the company. The pact was crafted by GM, the United Auto Workers 
and the owner of the recently divested Anderson facilities, a Citicorp-led 
venture called Delco Remy America. 
</P>
<P>
 The welcome news is that the plan grants the Van Nuys veterans now with Delco 
Remy essentially the same rights as laid-off GM workers to relocate to GM 
facilities with job openings. Openings will be awarded on the basis of 
seniority. Given the large number of job openings created by the company's 
booming sales, most and possibly all of the Van Nuys veterans who want new jobs 
with GM are expected to find them. 
</P>
<P>
 In most if not all cases, the workers are expected to land jobs similar to the 
ones they now hold, and likewise, their hourly pay will remain the same. 
Currently, assembly line workers receive $16.53 an hour, while skilled-trades 
workers get $19.37 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 But there also was some bad news for the Van Nuys veterans. Although company 
and union officials remain tight-lipped about relocation benefits, sources say 
the former Van Nuys employees will not be eligible for the $60,000 packages. 
Their relocation benefits are expected to be a maximum of $3,324. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, few of the Van Nuys veterans now in Anderson are expected to wind 
up back in California. A new GM sewing plant in Brea has been doing some 
hiring, but not many of the remaining Van Nuys veterans in Anderson are 
expected to qualify for the small number of available openings. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the "most important thing for them is to go back to a GM facility 
somewhere" so they can be assured of keeping their full pension benefits, said 
Mary Macomber, the wife of one of the former Van Nuys workers in Anderson and a 
leader of the group that pushed GM and the UAW to provide transfer rights. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Macomber remains concerned that GM, as part of its ongoing 
reorganization program, will continue selling plants across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that, in turn, would force the Van Nuys veterans and other so-called 
"GM gypsies" to keep on moving from plant to plant, disrupting their lives 
further. "It's not over yet," Macomber said.

HOUSING STARTS CLIMB 2.1% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The indicator: The Commerce Department reported housing starts for August. 
</P>
<P>
 * What they did: Construction of homes and apartments rose 2.1% to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,440,000 units from 1,410,000 in July.High 
mortgage rates battered the interest-sensitive single-family residential 
sector, but a sharp surge in multifamily construction boosted the overall 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
 * What it means: Some analysts are predicting mortgage rates will reach 9% by 
the end of the year, from less than 7% nearly a year ago. That would price out 
an estimated 200,000 first time buyers. The prospect of more renters is one of 
the factors driving up the multifamily sector, along with the restoration of a 
tax credit for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highlights: Construction of single-family homes -- 80% of residential 
construction -- slipped 2.7% in August after gaining 3.1% in July. New 
apartment building construction rose 28.5% last month following a 9.7% rise the 
month before. Regionally, in the West, housing starts dropped 14% to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 308,000 units last month. Annual Rate

 Arby's to Buy Long John Silver's for $525 Million: The owner of Arby's roast 
beef restaurants said it agreed to pay cash for Long John Silver's Restaurants 
Inc., the nation's biggest chain specializing in fish and seafood. The deal 
would create a restaurant company with a combined 4,200 outlets generating more 
than $2.5 billion in annual sales."The proposed addition of Long John Silver's 
nearly 1,450 locations to our existing system of 2,800 Arby's restaurants will 
propel us overnight to the top tier in the quick-service restaurant industry," 
said Nelson Peltz, chairman and chief executive of Triarc Companies Inc. of New 
York. Triarc would become the sixth-largest U.S. fast-food company, according 
to Technomic Inc., a Chicago-based restaurant consulting firm. McDonald's Corp. 
heads the list at $14.2 billion in domestic systemwide sales in 1993. 
Restaurants will display logos of both companies.

 Disney's Virginia Project Gets OK: Walt Disney Co.'s controversial, proposed 
$650-million theme park in rural Virginia cleared two important hurdles.The 
Prince William County Planning Commission approved rezoning plans for "Disney's 
America" with a historical theme near Haymarket, Va., a region rich with Civil 
War battlefields. And a regional transportation commission approved road 
projects worth about $130 million. The Disney project must also get approval 
from federal highway officials and the county board of supervisors. It is 
opposed by many environmental groups and historians. Approval came after 
lengthy debate and expressions of concern that the project would create more 
congestion and unhealthy air quality.

 Salkind Loses Round in Court: A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled 
that Alexander Salkind, who produced the "Superman" movies, is subject to the 
jurisdiction of the California courts. The ruling came in a case brought 
against Salkind by producers Jane Chaplin, Ilya Salkind and Robert Simmonds, 
who claim they are owed more than $6 million for loans and services connected 
with the 1992 movie "Christopher Columbus -- The Discovery."Alexander Salkind 
claimed that he has not set foot in California since the 1940s, but Judge 
Ricardo Torres ruled that Salkind has done enough business in the state to 
require him to respond to litigation. The plaintiffs are represented in the 
case by Elihu M. Berle, Stephen Chrystie and David Boyle.

 Some Shareholders Walk Out of Philip Morris Meeting: Representatives of six of 
the company's biggest institutional shareholders walked out because they felt 
the meeting was orchestrated and impeded serious dialogue. Shareholders, 
particularly union and public-employee pension funds, had been pressing for a 
meeting with Philip Morris managers to discuss splitting up the tobacco and 
food businesses and other issues. The shareholder representatives who left 
included those from the New York City employees pension fund, the public 
employees pension funds from Pennsylvania and Florida, the Teamsters union, 
Progressive Partners and the Council of Institutional Investors.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW FALLS 17 BUT FINISHES UP FROM LOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks closed broadly lower Wednesday for a second consecutive session, but 
the market finished well up from its low for the day. Trading was heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, short-term yields soared as traders bet that the Federal 
Reserve Board will raise interest rates again at its meeting on Tuesday. The 
dollar weakened further. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow industrials followed Tuesday's 67.63-point slump with 
a drop of 17.49 points to 3,851.60, as investors continued to react badly to 
the surprisingly large July U.S. trade deficit reported on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That report had sparked a plunge in the dollar versus the Japanese yen, in 
turn reigniting fears of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, brokerages Goldman Sachs & Co. and Bear, Stearns & Co. told 
clients to expect a Fed rate hike of as much as a half-point at the central 
bank's meeting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has raised short-term rates five times this year in an effort to ward 
off inflationary pressures. But economists at Goldman and Bear Stearns say the 
economy still appears to be growing faster than the Fed will allow. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade report, for example, showed that Americans' appetite for imports 
remains voracious. With the dollar weakening again, the Fed will be concerned 
about the threat of higher inflation from higher prices on foreign goods, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the government said Wednesday that construction of new homes rose for a 
second straight month in August despite higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are giving more credence to the fact that the Fed may move next week," 
said Joe LaVorgna, money market analyst at UBS Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the yield on three-month Treasury bills soared to 4.93%, up from 4.74% 
on Tuesday, as traders adjusted rates for the expected Fed move. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields also edged higher. The yield on the 30-year T-bond 
closed at 7.80%, the highest since June, 1992 and up from 7.77% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the stock market, a heavy midday selloff gave way to bargain-hunting 
later. The Dow had been down 46 points with one hour of trading to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said that some "short" sellers, who had previously sold borrowed stock 
in a bet on falling prices, may have taken profits by buying stock on the open 
market to cover their bets. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Stock Exchange said Wednesday that short positions reached a 
record 1.78 billion shares as of last Thursday, up from 1.63 billion in 
mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 12 to 5 on the NYSE 
on Wednesday, an improvement from the 18-to-5 ratio on Tuesday. Volume soared 
to 355 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling still was heavy in the Nasdaq market of mostly smaller stocks, where 
the composite index lost 6.03 points to 760.71 after diving 9.98 points 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sid Dorr, trader at Charles Schwab & Co. in San Francisco, said stocks' 
comeback late in the day suggested that the bears aren't in control. "It just 
doesn't feel like there's going to be a big move to the downside here," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said some sellers are simply locking in profits from the market's 
recent rally, ahead of the Fed meeting next week. Bullish analysts contend that 
investors will be lured back into the market in October by what are expected to 
be strong third-quarter corporate earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Transportation stocks again led the market decline on worries about higher 
interest rates' impact on the economy. AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell 1 
3/4 to 53, Delta dropped 1 1/4 to 44 1/2 and Burlington Northern lost 1 to 49 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many industrial stocks weakened. GM lost 1 1/8 to 48 5/8, Monsanto dropped 1 
3/4 to 81 1/8, Caterpillar sank 1 1/4 to 54 1/8 and Briggs & Stratton fell 2 
1/4 to 72 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retail stocks also tumbled. J.C. Penney dropped 1 3/8 to 51 1/4, Dayton 
Hudson slumped 3 1/8 to 73 3/4 and Home Depot was off 1 to 42 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial and utility stocks, which are most sensitive to interest rates 
hikes, were mixed. The Dow utility index added 0.99 point to 176.84 after 
falling to a six-year low on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among banks, Wells Fargo fell 1 5/8 to 149 5/8 but Chase Manhattan added 1 to 
35 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * In takeover activity, electronics distributor Anthem Electronics surged 7 
1/2 to 32 1/8 after agreeing to a buyout by Arrow Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tech issues were mixed. Software giant Computer Associates surged 2 3/4 
to 45 after winning a court case over computer codes, and Dell Computer 
rocketed 2 5/16 to 38 7/16 on optimism about PC sales. But Intel eased 5/8 to 
65 3/8 and IBM lost 3/4 to 69 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, the dollar eased to 1.545 German marks in New York on 
Wednesday, down from 1.553 on Tuesday. It also slipped to 97.65 Japanese yen, 
off marginally from Tuesday and near the post-World War II low of 97.50 set in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 stock index fell 22.5 points to 3,014.8 while 
Frankfurt's DAX index added 0.54 point to 2,079.50. Tokyo's Nikkei index rose 
48.11 points to 19,885.38. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, October gold futures added marginally to Tuesday's 
gains, up 50 cents to $394.60 on the Comex.

DEL MONTE CANS PENDING SALE TO MEXICO INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Del Monte Foods Co. said it scrapped its pending sale to an investor group led 
by Carlos Cabal Peniche, who is on the run from Mexican authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The group had pledged to buy San Francisco-based Del Monte for $277 million in 
cash and more than $630 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the sale agreement, Del Monte is keeping $30 million it had 
received through a letter of credit, because the transaction didn't close 
before Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Monte is one of the world's largest processors of fruits, vegetables, 
tomatoes and snack foods. It has operations in Mexico, Central America and the 
Philippines and reported fiscal 1994 sales of $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the closely held company's owners are Merrill Lynch & Co. and Citicorp. 
Del Monte Foods isn't affiliated with Del Monte Europe, Del Monte Far East or 
Fresh Del Monte Produce of Coral Gables, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican authorities can't find Cabal Peniche, but they have seized Grupo 
Financiero Cremi-Union, which he leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal Peniche, 41, authorized $200 million to $700 million in fraudulent loans 
to himself, and used the funds to buy controlling interests in other companies 
through shell companies, the Mexican Finance Ministry alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Those loans were used to mount the Del Monte takeover offer in April and for 
Cabal Peniche's $550-million purchase of Fresh Del Monte Produce, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least nine people have been arrested in the scandal, seven from Banco Union 
and two from Arrendadora Pragma, two subsidiaries of Grupo Cremi-Union, 
according to the Mexican attorney general.

</P>
<P>

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; PROGRAM HELPS KEEP U.S.

 A pilot program that cuts paperwork for international business travel got an 
11th-hour revival from Congress this week when members of the House voted to 
continue the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The visa waiver program allows foreign business travelers and tourists from 22 
eligible nations to travel to the United States without visas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Americans were accustomed to being able to travel widely without 
acquiring visas, especially in Europe, visitors from other countries had 
generally needed to prove they were not likely to try to stay in the U.S. 
permamently and often faced an annoying series of steps to get a visa. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiver program, started in 1988, recognized that free flow of business and 
leisure travelers would benefit international trade and was worth the small 
risk of allowing residents of certain developed countries to travel freely in 
the U.S. Also, some countries, such as France and Japan, agreed to drop visa 
requirements for U.S. visitors when the program began. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Obtaining visas can be a hassle for foreign business travelers and tourists, 
said Greg Farmer, U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean travelers, for example, are not covered by the program and must 
still obtain a visa to travel to the United States. A South Korean business 
owner could quickly get to Canada to nail down a deal but not the U.S. "Despite 
great efforts by the U.S. embassy in Seoul, there are lengthy lines for 
obtaining a U.S. visa," Farmer said. "However, Canada allows South Koreans to 
enter its territory without a visa and Australia issues visas to South Koreans 
within 24 hours, making these countries more competitive than ours." 
</P>
<P>
 The program extension, which is part of a bill called the Technical 
Corrections Act, now goes to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must 
act before Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Transport Assn., a Washington-based trade group representing the 
airline industry, as well as the Commerce Department, has been lobbying for the 
last month to make sure the program doesn't lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The program currently waives visa requirements for travelers from nations 
including Britain, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Switzerland, Germany, 
Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands, for stays of less than 90 days in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Only countries that have demonstrated that their citizens pose a low risk of 
illegal immigration to the United States can participate. To be eligible, 
countries must have had a low rate of visa refusals (less than 2%) and visa 
overstays (less than 2%) for the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The value of the program to international visitors is demonstrated by the 
growth in its use," Farmer said. "In 1988, only 10% of the total arrivals from 
the first eligible countries used the program. By 1993, 70% of total arrivals 
(from) nine of the primary countries used the visa waiver." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 million foreign visitors to the U.S. are expected to travel without 
visas this year. According to the Commerce Department, 95% of travelers from 
Japan now arrive without visas, 67% from Britain, 73% from Germany, 78% from 
France, 79% from Italy, 61% from Switzerland, 75% from the Netherlands, 50% 
from New Zealand and 62% from Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "The visa waiver is useful at a couple of different levels," said Air 
Transport Assn. spokesman Chris Chiames. "It makes the last-minute business 
meeting possible for a European businessman who finds out he needs to attend a 
meeting in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 It also makes it easier for international business travelers to take quick 
advantage of air fare deals without worrying about visa applications, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program was started as a way of making travel easier for foreign 
travelers and work of the U.S. government easier," said Gary Sheaffer, 
spokesman for the U.S. Department of State.  
</P>
<P>
 It has cut down the number of visas processed by some consulates by tens of 
thousands. The program may only be used by travelers who would otherwise have 
qualified for a visa. Travelers with criminal records, for example, could not 
enter the country legally, he said. Also, students are not eligible to have the 
visa requirement waived. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program has been very successful," Sheaffer said. "We would like to make 
it permanent." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the program has proven so popular that some members of Congress would 
like to see it expanded to include some countries, such as Greece, Ireland, and 
Portugal, which do not meet the current criteria, Chiames said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the visa waiver program is not renewed, many international business 
travelers would get bogged down in bureaucratic paperwork, he said. Because the 
program has dramatically reduced the number of visa applications for U.S. 
visits, many U.S. embassies and consulates have cut staff and no longer have 
the resources to process a surge in applications. In addition, if waivers are 
withdrawn, nations such as France and Japan may withdraw the reciprocal 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 It would throw everything into a state of confusion, said Chiames. "We don't 
even want to think about it." Visa-Free Entry

 Many business travelers use laptop computers, which are easily lost or stolen 
in the rush of a business trip. Should an IBM-compatible laptop simply be lost, 
the finder can be encouraged to return it with a screen message included in the 
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. 
</P>
<P>
 The message should display the name of the computer's owner, along with an 
address and phone number (with international dialing codes if traveling 
overseas) and an offer of a reward for the return of the system. 
</P>

HERTZ TO RAISE CAR RENTAL RATES UP TO 10%; RIVALS TO FOLLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hertz Corp., the nation's largest car rental company, today announced plans to 
boost car rental rates 8% to 10% to offset rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The rental car industry's trade group said it won't be long before rival 
companies such as Avis Inc., Budget Rent a Car Corp. and National Car Rental 
Systems Inc. match Hertz. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertz's price increases are effective immediately, except in Hawaii, where 
prices will be increased starting Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In most U.S. cities, the price increases will boost daily rates by $3 to $5, 
weekend rates by $2 and weekly rates by $10 to $20. The daily rate on a 
mid-size car at Chicago O'Hare Airport, for example, is up $5 to $49.99, while 
the weekly rate is up $15 to $100.99. The effect on discount rates will vary. 
</P>
<P>
 National and Avis executives said they expect to raise prices soon, while 
executives at Budget weren't immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, Hertz or Avis move first to raise prices and then the others 
follow," said Jan Armstrong, executive vice president of the American Car 
Rental Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is many times car rental companies can't maintain the price 
increases because of competition. It will be interesting to see what happens 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Auto prices paid by rental fleets have been rising at an annual rate of 25% to 
30%, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the third year in a row that car costs are up 25% to 30%," said 
Michael Olsen, National's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we start taking delivery on 1995 cars, we are incurring these costs and 
it's pretty darn dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have raise prices," Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's competitive out there so often these price increases don't often stick. 
I hope the prices stick this time."

 The largely free-market economy is suffering from a lingering recession that 
began in 1991 and was caused by a depressed market for exports (which account 
for about 30% of GDP) and the end of a barter system in which oil and gas from 
the former Soviet Union was exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; DROP IN U.S. EXPORTS SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slightly fewer American companies expect to sell their products overseas than 
last year, according to a Dun & Bradstreet Corp. survey published Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 17% of 5,000 companies surveyed in May said they plan to export during 
the next 12 months, down from 18.3% in the previous year's survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The cautious forecast comes a day after the Commerce Department reported that 
the nation's merchandise trade deficit surged 21.6% to $10.9 billion -- the 
second-worst gap in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the exporters surveyed, an increasing number said they were concerned 
that conditions overseas were not ripe for trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of firms reporting poor economic conditions abroad increased from 
23.3% last year to 44.8% this year, Dun & Bradstreet said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of exporters reporting that foreign trade barriers are an obstacle 
in their dealings fell to 34.4% from last year's 44.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 This perception was more common concerning Mexico and Canada, which with the 
United States approved the North American Free Trade Agreement earlier this 
year to gradually drop tariffs in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those companies that said they plan to do business overseas this year, 
60.8% said they expect those sales to be higher than last year, up from 59% in 
the previous year's survey. 
</P>
<P>
 However, only 48% of the companies planning to export last year actually 
increased exports in the ensuing 12 months, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Joseph W. Duncan, chief economist at Dun & Bradstreet, the poor 
showing in actual export activity is responsible for the cautious response 
companies gave to this year's survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no wonder that their 1994 plans are timid," he said. "The disappointment 
exporters experienced in 1993 helped shape their plans for 1994."

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; U.S. AND JAPAN AGREE TO OPEN NEW TRADE TALKS; COMMERCE: 
NEGOTIATORS RUSH TO MEET SEPT. 30 DEADLINE. NEITHER SIDE RELISHES SANCTIONS, OR 
CAPITULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior U.S. and Japanese negotiators opened trade talks Wednesday, racing to 
strike a deal ahead of a month's-end sanctions showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving for talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, Japanese 
Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said he was optimistic that an agreement would be 
reached before the Sept. 30 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will make every effort to reach agreement in Japan-U.S. trade talks. I have 
an impression that the U.S. is also willing to reach agreement," Kono said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kono, also expected to meet with President Clinton, added: "I cannot set a 
time limit at this moment but I do hope we are going to make a deal as soon as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo faces a stark ultimatum: open your markets or risk sanctions on 
everything from car parts to flat glass. And while neither side fancies a trade 
war, nor can either stomach the thought of capitulating in this, the home 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what sanctions course he might pursue, Kantor replied, "We have made no 
decision on any of that. We are waiting to see what Minister Kono has to say, 
and we will have our discussions (Wednesday) and in the next number of days." 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said he did not know if the Japanese were bringing new proposals. Asked 
if he had anything new to offer Tokyo, Kantor replied, "Our position is quite 
clear." 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. 
Brown said that history suggested that the talks would go down to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say there has been great progress thus far; there has some been 
some," he told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Kono's deputy, Sadayuki Hayashi, kicked off the day's meeting with Kantor's 
top Japan aide, Charlene Barshefsky, while Brown was expected to be in close 
telephone contact with his Japanese counterpart, Ryutaro Hashimoto. 
</P>
<P>
 In short: the heat is finally on. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiators last met early this month on the site of international trade 
talks in Los Angeles. While those talks helped improve the often sour tone of 
transpacific economic relations, administration officials said they forged 
little concrete progress. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue: how best to cut Japan's ballooning trade surplus and open its 
markets to more foreign goods. Despite months of fitful negotiations and plenty 
of promises to make "best efforts," the two-way trade picture remains bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported a staggering 21.6% jump in July's 
U.S. trade deficit, with Japan accounting for half the shortfall at $5.67 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The news -- much worse than expected -- was gobbled up in financial markets, 
which are increasingly fearful of a costly confrontation between the world's 
biggest economies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to go down to the wire," said economist Christopher Rupkey at 
Mitsubishi Bank. "The two parties are trying to negotiate (a trade truce) and 
they won't reveal their hands until the final minute." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Clinton met a clutch of top advisers to mull trade strikes should 
the last-ditch negotiations fail to broker a deal by Sept. 30, Administration 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said "all options" were under review as the two sides make one 
last stab at averting a sanctions showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanctions proposals are running on two tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Washington is pushing Tokyo to play fair when it awards government 
contracts in telecommunications and medical technology. Without a breakthrough, 
it will face retaliatory sanctions under so-called Title VII. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Tokyo could face accusations of discrimination on a range of fronts as 
part of the Super 301 law, which would trigger months of negotiations under the 
threat of sanctions.

 Japan Gross Domestic Product Contracts: Japan's Economic Planning Agency 
reported Wednesday that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted 0.4% in the 
April-June quarter for a 1.6% annual pace of contraction, well below market 
expectations for 0.3% growth.Analysts had anticipated some retreat from the 
strong 1.0% growth fueled during the January-March quarter, but the numbers 
caught many by surprise. For the latest quarter, personal consumption -- which 
accounts for just under 60% of GDP, slumped 0.7% from the prior quarter. "We 
had expected growth to fall back, but we didn't expect it to fall off a cliff, 
which is what it did," said Ronald Bevacqua, economist with Merrill Lynch Japan 
Inc.

 Cuba to Free Fixed Prices for Farmers: Cuba, seeking to ease food shortages, 
Wednesday announced details of a plan that frees farmers from the obligation to 
sell all produce to the state at fixed prices. According to a government 
decree, starting next month, all producers, from small private farmers through 
cooperatives to state farms and including workplaces with small 
"self-sufficiency" gardens and individuals with private vegetable plots, would 
be able to sell directly to the public after fulfilling quotas agreed upon with 
the state. Prices would be freely agreed between buyers and sellers, the decree 
said.

 S. African Police Force Striking Truckers From Highway: Signaling that the 
government will not tolerate strikes disrupting the economy, South African 
soldiers Wednesday forced 700 truckers demanding higher wages to clear a major 
highway they had blocked. President Nelson Mandela told labor unions earlier 
this month that strikes would scare off foreign investors, who are deemed 
essential to rejuvenating the economy. Labor unrest has plagued South Africa 
for the past two months.

FOUNDER OF FAILED HILL WILLIAMS DENIES INTENT TO DEFRAUD; COURTS: DONALD 
WILLIAMS JR. TELLS BANKRUPTCY JUDGE THAT HE EXPECTED TO MAKE 'A TON OF MONEY' 
FOR INVESTORS WHO FEAR THEY'VE LOST $90 MILLION IN PONZI SCHEME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Donald Hill Williams Jr. acknowledged Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here 
that several members of his family were on the payroll at his now-failed 
development company, that his mother lived in a company-owned house in Utah and 
that he continued to view Southern California's real estate market with 
optimism even as it teetered on the edge of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 But the founder and former president of now-bankrupt Hill Williams Development 
Corp. repeatedly stated that he never intended to defraud investors, who now 
fear that they have lost $90 million invested through the Anaheim Hills-based 
company before it filed for bankruptcy early in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was optimistic that we would prevail and make a ton of money at some time," 
Williams said during a hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Ryan. "I did 
everything I could do to protect the investors." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams testified during an ongoing hearing that investors hope will lead to 
a court ruling that Hill Williams Development Corp. , failed because of fraud. 
A finding that Williams engaged in fraud, attorneys for investors said, would 
prohibit the businessman from using his 1993 personal bankruptcy filing to 
cancel millions of dollars in judgments against him. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a San Diego-based accountant testified that a lengthy review of 
Hill Williams financial records led him to believe that the company was 
"operating a Ponzi scheme" by illegally using new investors' funds to pay 
financial obligations to earlier investors. 
</P>
<P>
 David Marston, a partner with Coopers & Lybrand in San Diego, testified that 
only about $10 million of the $105 million that Hill Williams accumulated ever 
went to buy land or pay "hard" construction costs on projects related to four 
Hill Williams investment funds. The rest, Marston said, went to related Hill 
Williams companies, to pay off other investors and for projects not related to 
the four investment funds. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a former Hill Williams chief financial officer said that, while 
he believed the company's investment programs were "in technical compliance" 
with applicable state law during 1992, he would not have invested additional 
money with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost a lot of money in this deal personally," Charles Rountree Jr. said. 
"But I believe the (investment operations) were technically in compliance." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will continue today, then resume on Oct. 4. Ryan did not indicate 
Wednesday when he will rule on whether fraud was involved in the company's 
failure.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: STATE OF THE ART EXPECTS LOWER EARNINGS FOR 2 QUARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Computer software maker State of the Art Inc. said Wednesday that its earnings 
for the third and fourth quarters will be lower than projected earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based company said its revenue is being hurt by a combination of 
slow sales during the current quarter and production delays on a new software 
package. State of the Art's new Windows-based accounting software, expected to 
be released this fall, will not debut until later in the year, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's Nasdaq trading, State of the Art's stock closed at $6.50 a 
share, up 44 cents.

O.C. FIRE VICTIMS RELOCATE, FIND IT WAS WRONG MOVE; HOUSING: LAGUNA COUPLES 
EXPECTED FEE WAIVERS TO REBUILD ELSEWHERE. THEY LIVE WITH FRUSTRATION, 
BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS.

 Last spring, as their neighbors pondered whether to rebuild their fire-ravaged 
homes on Buena Vista Way, two families decided to move elsewhere in the hope of 
speeding their recoveries from the devastating blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the city had promised to expedite the reconstruction efforts of all 
fire victims. On their new land, the Carys and the Williamsons reasoned, there 
would be no lingering fire-related cleanup, no geological worries that were 
then threatening to delay or scuttle their hopes of starting over on their old 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two couples have since discovered that they are not eligible for the 
special treatment and most of the fee breaks offered to other victims of last 
October's firestorm, which damaged or destroyed more than 400 homes here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that the city is more concerned about fire-damaged areas than 
fire-damaged people," said George Cary, who had lived on Buena Vista with his 
wife, Marlene, and their young daughter since 1985. "We thought that by moving 
to a new lot, we would accelerate the process. That hasn't worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Don and Jo Williamson share that frustration. In February, the elderly couple 
made the wrenching decision to move from the land they have owned for 38 years, 
prompted by the fear that a suspected ancient landslide might slow or cancel 
their hopes to build there. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, though, when their plans finally emerged from the city's 
arduous design review process, the Williamsons had made little progress toward 
erecting their new home in Laguna's Bluebird Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want to do is get into a house while we have some time to enjoy it," 
said Don Williamson, 80, an architect who designed the new house -- and the old 
one -- himself. "When you reach this age, it ain't no fun to lose that much 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson and his wife, Jo, 78, said they long ago relinquished their dream 
of having a new house by the Oct. 27 anniversary of the blaze that claimed 
their home and eight others on Buena Vista, a narrow ribbon of a street in the 
hills above this city's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 But they remain frustrated that groundbreaking for the new dwelling is still 
at least two months away. "It isn't as if we haven't been working on it," Don 
Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials acknowledge that families like the Williamsons and the Carys 
are not eligible for the special processing and fee waivers granted to other 
fire victims, which they said were intended specifically to speed rebuilding in 
the fire-scarred neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who qualify for fee waivers are those who qualify for the city's 
special rebuilding policies and procedures, and that is limited to the 
fire-damaged areas," Community Development Director Kyle Butterwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the city decided against waiving fees for those who moved away 
because the assessments would be covered by their insurance. The fees for 
zoning, design and building checks can amount to $3,000 to $4,000 for a typical 
house in Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterwick said he knew of no other cases to date of fire victims who decided 
to move from burned out lots and build new homes elsewhere in Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a recent meeting with City Manager Kenneth C. Frank, Butterwick said 
city officials in the future will try to accelerate the permit process for 
these fire victims as well, although it will still assess them the fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling now is that these people should also receive some preferential 
treatment regarding the turnaround time," Butterwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the delays encountered by the two families are not uncommon as 
this city's small bureaucracy struggles to accommodate the needs of hundreds of 
fire victims, many on virtually identical rebuilding schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Williamsons and Carys also have been slowed by other factors, 
including opposition to their plans from several of their new neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of two other former Buena Vistans provide a vivid contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 James Kelly and Robert Mangel opted to skip the headaches of reconstruction 
and, in May, moved into an existing house in Laguna's Woods Cove. While they 
remain emotionally scarred by the fire, which destroyed their Spanish-style 
dwelling next to the Williamsons' A-frame, their lives are "basically back to 
normal," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was a single, maddening experience with the city's bureaucracy 
that helped persuade Kelly to bypass the inevitable hassles of rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the fire, he received a citation from the city because his indoor 
whirlpool tub was suddenly outdoors; the room that had housed it had burned, 
along with the rest of his home. And by law, outdoor spas must be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kelly went to Laguna's City Hall to obtain a permit for the spa cover. Even 
though a good-hearted neighbor had already made the cover for him, the 
paperwork was still required, Kelly was told. 
</P>
<P>
 He waited first in a line where fire victims could have their permit fees 
waived, then in another, then in the first again. Just as he reached the head 
of the fourth -- and final -- line, the computer malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt this anger and rage just come over me, and I'm ready to take off the 
head of the clerical person trying to help me," Kelly said. "And that would 
have been happening throughout the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after learning of the hardships of those going forward with rebuilding, 
he added, "all I can say is I'm so glad I'm not up there fighting City Hall or 
fighting my neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the only fire-related matter still facing Kelly and Mangel is a 
hearing today at which they will appeal last year's property tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so for the Carys, whose decision to leave Buena Vista Way was prompted by 
several considerations, among them a desire to find a flatter, more 
"child-friendly" lot for their daughter Christina, now 15 months old, and the 
second child they are expecting in January. 
</P>
<P>
 They also were motivated by "the specter of geological problems," George Cary 
said, the concerns raised last spring in several fire-damaged sections of 
Laguna that previously unknown ancient landslides might exist under some of the 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of studies, geologists found that the slides either did not 
exist or were less severe than had been feared. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, though, both the Carys and the Williamsons had bought land 
elsewhere, worried that any finding of instability on the hillsides might 
translate to extra costs or delays for them. For now, both are holding on to 
their old lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carys, who had reached a relatively early settlement with their insurance 
company, purchased a large, undeveloped piece of property at the head of a 
bluff on Pacific Avenue, across a canyon from Buena Vista. The new lot commands 
a view of the ocean and various Laguna landmarks that is even more sweeping 
than the vista at their previous home. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost immediately, they ran into delays. "We were told that because we'd 
changed lots, we were not entitled to the concessions other fire victims got," 
George Cary said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the Carys' plans to build a 5,000-square-foot house on 
their Pacific Avenue lot have met with a storm of protest from people whose 
views would be affected by the project. At a hearing last month, nearly a dozen 
of their new neighbors signed letters or appeared before the Design Review 
Board to ask that the plans be turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was continued until today, but the two sides remain far apart and 
upset at one another, long before the Carys will move in. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesley Domiano, whose home behind the Carys' property was completed in June, 
says her new neighbors' house would obliterate virtually her entire view of the 
Pacific and several Laguna landmarks. She and her husband bought their land 
only after assurances from previous owners of the Carys' lot that any structure 
there would be low-profile, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying to them, 'Don't build here.' We're just saying that they 
should give us the same consideration that we've all given to each other when 
we built our own houses," Domiano said. "This is Laguna. This is the way it 
works here." 
</P>
<P>
 George Cary responded that his redesigned house will be low-profile, built 
almost entirely on one level. Nonetheless, he said, he will now propose 
lowering the structure several feet, as suggested by one Design Review Board 
member, although that will involve moving several truckloads of earth and cost 
him an extra $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 His anger remains palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it's delays, hassles and a feeling of 'Do we really want to 
move into this neighborhood that is reacting this way?' " George Cary said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the alternative to lowering the home -- an expected rejection of the plan 
by the Design Review Board that would have to be appealed to the City Council 
-- seems equally unattractive, he said, and likely to lead to further delays. 
</P>
<P>
 With their living expense benefits scheduled to run out in six months, "we 
need a house," Cary said. "We need to get this process going." 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamsons, whose decision to leave Buena Vista was greeted with special 
sadness by other longtime residents of the street, have encountered similar 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the couple's plans for a 1,700-square-foot house on Morningside Drive 
were submitted to the city in mid-May, they emerged only last month from the 
design review process -- the result of bureaucratic delays and opposition from 
a new neighbor, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was not until Don Williamson complained about the delays in June 
that his plans were discovered sitting on a zoning official's desk, where they 
had been -- apparently untouched -- for more than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me it was because they weren't thinking of Jo and me as fire 
victims," said Williamson, the former director of Laguna's Pageant of the 
Masters. "Silly, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The day after his complaint, however, the Williamsons received word that the 
plans were ready for design review. And there was another sign that the city 
had taken notice of the couple's plight: right after Don Williamson paid the 
fees for design review, he was asked to return to City Hall to pick up a refund 
of nearly $600, an amount that covered most of what he had just paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just told me it had been decided that we wouldn't have to pay that 
amount," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Williamsons are making amends with Ed and Dee Ann Shaw, the 
neighbors who opposed the couple's plans because they feared the new house 
would obstruct a portion of their view through Bluebird Canyon to the distant 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the Design Review Board struck a compromise, giving neither the 
Shaws nor the Williamsons exactly what they wanted. The Shaws lost part of 
their view and the Williamsons lost easy access to their side yard and a few 
feet of space in their entryway. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, both parties sounded conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do two things with these situations," said Ed Shaw. "You can . . . 
carry the dispute forward for generations to come. Or you can say what's done 
is done. . . . I wish him well." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson sounded a similar note. "We're not at all unhappy. We wish the 
house was as originally designed, but we'll still have a nice house. And maybe 
we can start over in the process of forming a friendship."

SEARCH IN SIMPSON CASE UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A detective recklessly misstated facts to get a search warrant a day after the 
murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, but that is not enough 
to justify throwing out evidence obtained in the search of O.J. Simpson's 
estate, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was another victory for prosecutors in fending off relentless 
defense attempts to have Ito suppress what may be key evidence against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 But as soon as the ruling came down, a new battle began as Ito allowed the 
defense to call witnesses in an attempt to suppress evidence that had been 
gathered from Simpson's home under a second warrant. The defense contends that 
the second warrant precipitated a search that was overly broad and therefore 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 During that testimony, defense lawyers learned from the two lead detectives in 
the case that some items taken in the second search seem to have little to do 
with items that the warrant authorized them to seize. The challenged items 
include videos of "Frogmen," a television movie pilot that Simpson was 
shooting, and highlights of his football career. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the June 12 slayings of his ex-wife and 
Goldman outside her Brentwood condominium. Jury selection in his trial is 
scheduled to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's hearing was one of a series of pretrial proceedings in which 
attorneys have jockeyed to bolster their cases before presenting them to 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Wednesday, Ito: 
</P>
<P>
 * Put off until next week an inquiry into why Simpson's longtime personal 
assistant, Cathy Randa, shredded some papers investigators saw at his business 
office and later came back to seize with a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ordered turned over to the defense and prosecution police records relating 
to an August, 1993, unsolved slaying in Hollywood. Simpson's lawyers contend 
that the manner of death in that case makes it so similar to the Brentwood 
murders that it may point to a suspect other than Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refused to allow the defense to call Marcia Clark, the lead prosecutor in 
the case, to the stand Wednesday, but left open the possibility that she, and 
presumably other prosecutors, could be called later. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heard arguments on whether a warrant issued to seize Simpson's Ford Bronco 
authorized police to search the vehicle and on whether the vehicle was so 
loosely monitored at an auto yard that it was burglarized and left open to 
other tampering. 
</P>
<P>
 * Postponed a decision on whether to allow the defense to take testimony to 
challenge the credibility and character of Mark Fuhrman, a Los Angeles police 
detective who has testified that he found a bloody glove on Simpson's estate 
similar to one discovered at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman's lawyer went on the offensive Wednesday to try to protect the 
reputation of his client. At a news conference during the hearing's noon 
recess, Robert Tourtelot told reporters that a woman lied when she contended 
that his client once made racist statements. Defense lawyers contend that those 
statements by Fuhrman indicate bias against Simpson. She either confused 
Fuhrman with someone else or was angry because he had rejected her romantic 
advances, Tourtelot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Bell, in a written declaration she turned over to defense lawyer 
Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. in July, has contended that Fuhrman in the mid-1980s 
made disparaging remarks about black people in general and interracial couples 
in particular, raising the possibility that he was predisposed to dislike 
Simpson, who is black and whose ex-wife was white. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourtelot also asserted that during an Aug. 29 court hearing, Cochran 
misrepresented Bell's statements about Fuhrman and the assertions of a man 
whose lawyer contends that Fuhrman made a racial slur to him after the officer 
and his partner shot him, allegedly without cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourtelot said he would ask Ito to refer the Cochran statements to the 
California State Bar for possible discipline against the defense lawyer and 
would ask Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti to refer the Bell matter to the state 
attorney general for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell could not be reached for comment, and Cochran dismissed Tourtelot's 
allegations as "preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, a San Pedro real estate agent, contends that Fuhrman made the offensive 
remarks to her at a Marine Corps recruiting station in Redondo Beach in 1985 or 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anthony J. Pellicano, a private investigator hired by Tourtelot to 
investigate Bell's background, contended at the Wednesday news conference that 
three former marines who say they were present when Fuhrman talked to Bell do 
not recall him saying anything improper. Pellicano acknowledged that he has 
received no sworn affidavits from the marines. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the marines, reached Wednesday evening, confirmed that he knew Bell and 
Fuhrman in the mid-1980s, when Bell worked at a real estate office above a 
Marine recruiting station in Redondo Beach. Maximo Cordoba, 44, of Bellflower, 
said that Fuhrman had come into the recruiting office twice to talk about going 
on active duty in the reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time, when Mark was with me or in our office, did he speak in any 
racist manner about blacks or anyone," said Cordoba, who said he is black. 
Cordoba said he did not recall seeing Bell in the office when Fuhrman was 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 In ruling on the flawed search warrant, executed June 28, Ito said he was 
concerned about how an experienced officer, Detective Philip L. Vannatter, one 
of the two lead investigators in the case, could make so many errors in his 
request for a judge's authorization to search Simpson's property. 
</P>
<P>
 In the search warrant request, Vannatter said human blood was found on 
Simpson's Bronco, on the driveway of his estate and on the glove found on the 
property when no such confirmation had been made. He described as "unexpected" 
a trip to Chicago that Simpson had planned for two months. Vannatter also 
failed to note on the request that Simpson had agreed by phone to return to Los 
Angeles and cooperate with police. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito rejected Clark's contention that representations were at most negligent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to make a finding that it is at least reckless," Ito said. But he 
nonetheless spurned the defense's request to invalidate the search conducted 
after the warrant was obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the defense lost its attempt to get the evidence suppressed, legal 
experts said that Ito's finding produced a public relations point for Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "One important theme throughout the pretrial process that the defense has 
pushed insistently is that you can not necessarily trust the credibility of 
police officers, and Wednesday in a limited fashion Judge Ito helped endorse 
that message by his finding," said UCLA criminal law professor Peter Arenella. 
</P>
<P>
 In agreeing to allow the defense to query witnesses about the scope of the 
second search warrant, which Ito also ruled legal Wednesday, the judge said he 
had "about 30 questions I want to ask myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The first witnesses called by the defense were Vannatter and his partner, Tom 
Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 In questioning them, the defense "did a very effective job of demonstrating 
that the second search of Mr. Simpson's home included police behavior that is 
extremely hard to justify," Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
 What the defense is trying to establish, he said, is that the second search 
"degenerated into a general exploratory search in which the police seized a 
great deal of material not listed in the warrant and which was clearly not 
incriminating on its face," including the "Frogmen" tape. 
</P>
<P>
 During the questioning, defense lawyers repeatedly suggested that officers sat 
around Simpson's living room watching watching the movie and football videos on 
television. They also suggested that officers may have assembled a "shrine" 
from photographs of Simpson's family in his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter acknowledged that scripts, schedules and notepads were seized from 
Simpson's home when none of those items were listed on the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter appeared testy Wednesday and said he believed everything that was 
seized was obtained legally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe if I see an item in plain view that has evidentiary value, (it) can 
be seized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense wants Clark, her co-counsel, Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman, 
and a third prosecutor to testify about what they saw during the search. All 
three have been subpoenaed by the defense, but are fighting being forced to 
take the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter testified Wednesday that the prosecutors were at the scene during 
the search, but were merely questioning witnesses, including Fuhrman.

MTA CHIEF LAUNCHES BID TO REVAMP CONSTRUCTION ARM; TRANSIT: WHITE HIRES 
EXECUTIVE TO REVIEW TROUBLED RAIL CONSTRUCTION CORP. BOARD DELAYS EFFORT TO 
DISSOLVE AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN and HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attempting to gain tighter control over the troubled Los Angeles subway and 
light-rail projects, the top executive of the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority announced Wednesday that he has begun revamping the agency's 
construction practices. 
</P>
<P>
 But elected officials rebuffed his attempt to immediately dissolve the MTA 
subsidiary that is overseeing construction of the multibillion-dollar Metro 
Rail project. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White first announced the hiring of a 
veteran public transit executive to review how the agency designs, builds and 
monitors the transit project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past year I have become increasingly concerned about the rail 
construction program," White said as he announced the hiring of Jerry B. 
Baxter, now chief of regional operations for the California Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter, a 32-year Caltrans veteran who has supervised freeway repairs after 
the Northridge earthquake, will be "responsible for revamping the MTA's rail 
construction procedures and practices," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 But within hours, officials who serve on the MTA's board of directors declined 
to vote on White's proposal to dissolve the Rail Construction Corp., a 
subsidiary agency that has come under fire because of problems with 
construction quality and cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
 The frenzy of maneuvering Wednesday reflected an increasingly public struggle 
for power over key decisions driving the nation's largest public works project. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who was hired to lead the MTA in the spring of 1993, has had to address 
serious problems reported by The Times, including subway tunnel walls built 
thinner than designed and leaks of potentially hazardous gases. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the past month, he and other MTA officials have drawn criticism for the 
handling of subway tunneling beneath Hollywood Boulevard. Ground sinkage there 
of up to nine inches, ruptures of water and sewer lines and damage to buildings 
have forced a costly halt in the tunneling. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agencies are investigating the problems. The Hollywood area's 
congressman, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), called for a review by the 
U.S. secretary of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's MTA board meeting, White sought to disband the RCC, which in 
1990 had absorbed authority over rail construction held by the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
 The RCC is governed by its own board of political appointees who recommend 
contract awards and changes to the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 White's proposal said the consolidation in 1993 of the region's transit 
agencies into the MTA has rendered the RCC obsolete. "So far as we can 
determine, no other city has found it necessary to utilize a similarly 
structured . . . subsidiary for the construction of its transit system," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, few of the 11 MTA board members on hand wanted to act on White's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of them -- Los Angeles County Supervisors Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Mike 
Antonovich -- later said they were ready to support White but had been asked to 
delay action by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and City Councilman Richard 
Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ready to vote today," Burke said. "But the mayor wanted to put it over 
for a month so he would have a chance to discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the RCC's role in administering construction contracts obscures 
accountability and has diluted the power of elected officials on the MTA board. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to have the RCC making all of the decisions that they 
make," Burke said. "We really don't have a chance to have input." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, who sits on the MTA board and has three appointees on it, was 
traveling Wednesday from Washington, D.C., according to an aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that the mayor agrees or disagrees," said the mayor's press 
secretary, Noelia Rodriguez. "He just wanted to be a part of the discussion 
related to this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre, who has opposed White's proposal, was said by an aide to be on 
vacation. "The councilman wants to have some input prior to having some action 
taken," said Sharon Neely, who left the MTA one year ago to join Alatorre's 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 One official who urged a vote Wednesday was county Supervisor Gloria Molina. 
Declaring that the time for delay was past, Molina said she was "fairly 
disgusted" with the MTA's rail construction performance. She noted that White 
first sought and failed to win board approval to dissolve the RCC four months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am concerned that the RCC is a key culprit" in the construction problems, 
Molina said. "We're operating in the dark. . . . We need to have more hands-on 
involvement. We need to get control." 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the RCC, Robert E. Kruse, said the agency has done nothing 
wrong and has the expertise to manage the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best-managed public works program in the country," said Kruse, an 
equipment-leasing contractor who serves without salary. "We (the RCC) make a 
fine sacrificial lamb at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the MTA's inspector general issued an analysis of 
seven subway contract increases, totaling about $2 million, that were granted 
to Tutor-Saliba Corp. The review was requested last spring by Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector general found that six of the seven increases, or "change 
orders," approved by RCC staff and consultants were "questionable" and possibly 
unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruse said Wednesday that the change orders were appropriate and that the 
inspector general's report amounts to second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald N. Tutor, president of Tutor-Saliba, said his company has been paid 
only what it was owed and that any questioning of the change orders should be 
directed to representatives of Parsons-Dillingham, the construction management 
firm that oversees subway construction on behalf of the RCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Edelman, who will be chairman of the MTA until he retires as a county 
supervisor in December, said he wanted to postpone White's proposal for one 
month, until the newly hired Baxter offers his advice. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Baxter said he would not begin working at the MTA until Nov. 1. His 
salary and title have yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a reflection on Frank (White)," Edelman said. "We're trying to move 
in an orderly way. It may not be as fast as some people like, but we're headed 
in the right direction."

 Holding a radio directional antenna aloft, Stewart Towindo turns slowly in a 
circle atop a rocky ridge. He listens carefully in his earphones for the 
sonar-like beeps that mean his prey is near. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over there," the ecologist says, pointing at a distant hill. His tracker and 
guard, Million Sibanda, shoulders an AK-47 assault rifle and leads the way. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than an hour, they hike down rugged gulches and through an arid 
expanse of brown acacia and thorny scrub. They spot the tracks of zebras, 
giraffes, impalas and hyenas. They surprise a herd of horned kudu, which leap 
away silently into the bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Loud crunching and crashing suddenly fill the air. "Elephants," Towindo 
explains. The giant tuskers flap their ears to keep cool as they eat. To reach 
leaves, they yank down branches or simply push over trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking on, Towindo repeatedly checks his radio signal to adjust course. Each 
time, Sibanda sifts sandy soil through his fingers to check the breeze. He 
wants to stay downwind. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, both men stop and smile. A black rhinoceros stands 20 yards away, her 
armored skin half hidden in the brush. The radio transmitter hangs from her 
neck on a thick nylon-and-leather collar. A huge calf suddenly lurches beside 
her. Their ears are erect, and the dim-sighted animals peer nervously toward 
the intruders. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the massive two-horned beasts resume munching noisily on a nearby bush. 
"The chewing sound is a giveaway," Towindo whispers. "That's what poachers 
listen for." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the front line of Africa's worst wildlife war, the losing battle to 
save the once-plentiful black rhinoceros from virtual extinction in the wild. 
And by all accounts, Diceros bicornis may be doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Zimbabwe, ruthless poachers armed with AK-47s have all but annihilated 
the last major stronghold of black rhinos. The country's black rhino 
population, long the world's largest, has plummeted from an estimated 2,500 in 
1991 to fewer than 300. The once-teeming Zambezi Valley is empty of rhinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Poachers have relentlessly blasted the animals and hacked off their horns for 
sale to the Far East. They've succeeded despite radio collars, dehorning of 
hundreds of rhinos, use of heavily protected animal sanctuaries and a 
shoot-to-kill policy that has left 178 suspected poachers and four game wardens 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Glen Tatham, who launched Zimbabwe's rhino protection program a decade 
ago and runs it today, calls his efforts "a spectacular failure." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief wildlife warden points to gory photos of mutilated rhinos that line 
his office wall. "It's been a terrible battle," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although millions of dollars have been donated from abroad, Tatham insists he 
has never had enough money, equipment or political backing to fight poachers. 
Corruption has never been far off. Police, game wardens and even a member of 
Zimbabwe's Parliament have been convicted of killing rhinos or trading in the 
horn. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is the motive. Rhino horn is more valuable than gold after a price 
markup similar to that for cocaine. The poacher usually is paid $350 per horn, 
which may weigh 20 pounds. The same horn is worth $1,000 a pound to middlemen 
in Lusaka, capital of neighboring Zambia, where most of the gangs are based. 
</P>
<P>
 But the price jumps to $13,600 a pound after the horn -- made of material 
similar to human fingernails -- is smuggled to Taiwan, South Korea and other 
Asian nations where traditional healers crush it for potions used to treat 
fevers and other maladies. A market also thrives in Yemen, where the horn is 
prized for ceremonial dagger handles. 
</P>
<P>
 Poaching isn't unique here, of course. Zimbabwe's sad slaughter mirrors what 
already has happened across most of Africa. Experts say that fewer than 2,500 
black rhinos survive -- down from at least 65,000 believed to have roamed the 
continent in 1970. It was then Africa's most abundant rhino species. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a catastrophic decline," says Clive Walker, head of the Rhino and 
Elephant Foundation, during a recent two-day conference of rhino experts 
outside Pretoria, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at the end of the crisis," agrees Michael Knight, a rhino authority 
with South Africa's Natal Parks Board. "This is our very last chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Although poaching from neighboring Mozambique has increased, South Africa is 
the only country where a rhino population has grown substantially and where 
several dozen rhinos are legally shot by trophy hunters each year. Indeed, it 
is a conservation success story. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1920, only a dozen southern white, or square-lipped rhinos, were known to 
have survived widespread overhunting. After intensive protection and breeding 
efforts, 5,300 white rhinos live in South African parks and on private land. 
Hundreds more have been sent to zoos and safari parks around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, South Africa will propose removing the white rhino from the most 
endangered list at the biannual meeting of the Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., from Nov. 7 to 18. CITES, 
as it is known, has banned all trade in products from the two African (black 
and white) and three Asian (Sumatran, Javan and Indian) rhino species since 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that sustainable use is now possible, South Africa will call for 
shifting the white rhino to the threatened category. If approved, regulated 
trade in white rhino hides and ultimately horn could resume. Zimbabwe will 
support the move, arguing that the ban clearly hasn't worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rhino horn, as far as we're concerned, should be traded," says Michael Kock, 
chief veterinarian with Zimbabwe's department of national parks and wildlife 
management. "This is one example of a ban that has failed completely. . . . Why 
practice a policy that has failed for so many years?" 
</P>
<P>
 There is another reason. Kock's office sits atop a strongroom holding an 
estimated $4 million worth of rhino horn. Officials here say the money is 
desperately needed for conservation and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the trove is from dehorning. Using helicopters, tranquilizers and 
saws, veterinarians cut horns off almost 500 rhinos in 1992 in hopes of 
removing the reason for poaching. But the process is expensive -- $1,000 per 
animal -- and must be repeated regularly, since a horn grows several inches a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts argue bitterly about whether removing the horn helps or whether it 
makes the animal more vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dick Pitman, who heads the Zambezi Society, a prominent conservation group 
in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, says there is no alternative. "A rhino 
without a horn may or may not get shot. But a rhino with a horn certainly 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, others fear that sinister new market forces are at work: Organized 
poachers may be deliberately aiming to kill the last rhino. "These guys are 
sitting on stockpiles that will rocket in price if the rhino goes extinct," 
worries zoologist Sky Alibhai, who heads a rhino census project in Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half Zimbabwe's rhinos are in private parks and conservancies. Most 
of the rest have been herded into four new "intensive protection zones." In 
theory, the army, police, air force and intelligence agencies are helping to 
coordinate anti-poaching efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see these IPZs as the last stronghold," explains Tatham, the chief warden. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest number of surviving black rhinos are here in Sinamatella, 656 
square miles of parched grassland and rugged hills deep inside Hwange park. The 
warden is Norman English, a lanky 34-year-old with a lopsided grin. 
</P>
<P>
 His war room has a table covered with crackling radios. A wall map, protected 
by a faded curtain, is marked with bright red arrows for poacher routes and 
with grim black circles for dead rhinos. Six soldiers play cards outside beside 
10 bleached rhino skulls. All the skulls are missing horns. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the map, English says his zone contains "anywhere from 25 to 65 
rhinos," down from hundreds a decade ago. "In 1982, we used to use rhino horns 
as doorstops and leave them outside at night," he recalls. "That shows how 
valueless they were." 
</P>
<P>
 No longer. English has too few animals to study effective management and 
protection techniques. He deploys 38 armed scouts on weeklong patrols but says 
he needs twice as many just to track the rhino, a solitary creature with a 
notoriously nasty attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Chasing poachers is another matter. The last known poaching here was in March. 
One suspect was killed, another wounded and a third escaped after a long 
manhunt. Five sets of black rhino horns were recovered, all from dehorned 
animals. But English says shooting poachers isn't the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shot over 30 poachers and lost 104 rhino," he says of his tenure in a 
previous post in northwestern Zimbabwe. And the poachers are increasingly 
sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're masters in the bush," he says, shaking his head. "They're on a par 
with any Special Forces in the world. They'll go without water for two days and 
walk 100 kilometers (62 miles) in a day. And they disappear. They leave no 
tracks. They start anti-tracking. They're unreal." 
</P>
<P>
 Some poachers tie cloth on their shoes to hide their tracks, or walk backward 
to confuse pursuers. They walk on logs and rocks and build no fires. The last 
group were caught only when they were heard chopping a tree for honey. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, all is quiet in the rhino war. English says he doesn't know if that's 
good news or bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if it's because of the increased law enforcement," he says 
moodily, staring at his map. "Or, basically, because there are almost no rhino 
left."

ARISTIDE THANKS U.S., URGES END TO VIOLENCE; LEADERSHIP: HAITIAN PRESIDENT BOWS 
TO PRESSURE BUT BALKS AT PRAISING PACT DESIGNED TO RESTORE HIM TO POWER. 
</P>

<P>
 Succumbing to American pressure, Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
publicly called Wednesday for an end to the bloody clashes between police and 
his supporters, and he finally thanked President Clinton for the 3-day-old 
agreement designed to restore him to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeted at the Pentagon with flattering pomp and circumstance -- a full-dress 
ceremony highlighted by the 21-gun salute due a head of state -- Aristide urged 
Haitians to say "no to violence, no to vengeance; yes to reconciliation, yes to 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "Continue to uphold democracy, be vigilant, and guard against 
provocation." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, shaken by television footage of Haitian police battering 
demonstrators Tuesday, joined Aristide's exhortations with a blunt warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he strongly condemned the police violence that killed at least 
one person and said the United States will not tolerate such behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements from Clinton and Aristide were designed not only for a Haitian 
audience but also to quiet an outcry from Congress, where members of both 
houses have sharply criticized Aristide for a near-silence that they said 
showed ingratitude and hurt efforts to calm Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's public appeal came after an intensifying campaign by Administration 
officials -- described by one Aristide associate as a "firestorm" -- to 
pressure the Haitian president to try to calm his country. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide had been impressed, officials said, by briefings on the 
Administration's newly implemented plans to begin in some circumstances to 
restrain and disarm the Haitian police. 
</P>
<P>
 Those plans made at least a short step toward meeting Aristide's demands that 
U.S. forces intervene directly to halt police misconduct and begin disarming 
the army and police. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Aristide continued to snub urgings that he praise the agreement itself -- 
saying, in fact, nothing about the pact to replace Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras with 
Aristide's own government by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 In its ceremony at the Pentagon, the Administration went the full length to 
display the extent of U.S. commitment to Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony, called the "cordon of honor," includes the playing of the 
national anthems of both countries before a military guard and the firing of a 
row of cannons. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion drew to the ceremonial dais an unusually large crew of 
Administration figures, including Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony is often held out of public view, as it was last month when Perry 
welcomed China's third-ranking army officer, Deputy Chief of Staff Xu Huizi, to 
the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this occasion, a White House aide said, "we wanted to make sure people 
saw it here -- and in Haiti too." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest attempt to twist Aristide's arm occurred after the ceremony, in a 
50-minute session in which the Haitian president heard Perry, Lake and Joint 
Chiefs Chairman Gen. John M. Shalikashvili lead a multimedia presentation on 
the situation in Haiti and the unfolding U.S. deployment there. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide sat silently in a conference room called the "tank" as he heard Perry 
call the police violence unacceptable and ask, once again, for a public 
statement from him. 
</P>
<P>
 After the presentations, Aristide read a brief statement thanking Clinton and 
U.S. soldiers involved in the Haiti operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton . . . this is the result of your leadership. Thank you and 
the people of the United States for your commitment to lead a multinational 
effort in carrying out the will of the United Nations to help restore democracy 
to Haiti," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration aides said that in their conversations with Aristide over the 
last two days, officials have tried to "simply persuade him that he needs to do 
the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But they have also bluntly pointed out his dependence on them -- not only 
during the next three weeks, but in the years to follow, when his nation's weak 
economy may depend heavily on what it can get in U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Aristide was clearly impressed by the officials' 
description of the plans for deployment of military police. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also pleased, according to aides, that U.S. officials plan to start 
meeting with his designated defense minister to make arrangements for running 
the nation once Aristide resumes power. 
</P>
<P>
 But he expressed concerns about the proposal, still being debated by U.S. 
officials, to ban demonstrations in Haiti. And, according to associates, he is 
reserving judgment on the value of new interpretations of the rules of 
engagement in Haiti that will allow U.S. troops to intervene to prevent police 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In his talks with U.S. officials, Aristide's top goals have been to persuade 
them to speed up their timetable for the disarmament of the Haitian military 
and to expand the role of the U.S. troops to prevent the Haitian military from 
committing violence against the Haitian people.

U.S. STARTS DISMANTLING HAITI ARMY, ORDERS END TO BEATINGS; CARIBBEAN: AMERICAN 
COMMANDERS MOVE TO ABOLISH FEARED ARMORED UNIT. MORE THAN 1,000 MPS WILL HELP 
ENFORCE PEACE AFTER BRUTAL ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS.

<P>
 American commanders Wednesday began dismantling the Haitian army, ordering the 
abolition of its most powerful unit and telling Haiti's military leader that 
"the beatings of civilians must stop now." 
</P>
<P>
 After a morning meeting between Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, commander of the 
American occupation force here, and Haitian army chief Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, a 
U.S. Army spokesman made this announcement: 
</P>
<P>
 "In an agreement signed by Gen. Shelton and Gen. Cedras, the Heavy Weapons 
Company . . . will cease to be a viable military unit. . . . All weapons of the 
unit (60 antiaircraft guns, six armored personnel carriers and assorted other 
armament) will be rendered inoperative." 
</P>
<P>
 The Heavy Weapons Company, with about 200 soldiers, is considered the only 
relatively well trained and equipped unit of the 7,000-member Haitian army. It 
had a fearsome, almost mystical reputation for the rest of the troops and the 
population at large. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can sleep now," a Haitian driver said. "They won't be able to come into my 
home with their Uzis and rob us." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 1,000 U.S. military police were put on alert in Haiti to guard 
against further violence by Haitian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Haiti's de facto civilian government banned public demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cedras said he will not go into exile, although he is required to step down 
by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. troops continued to pour into Haiti, with up to 8,000 expected to have 
arrived Wednesday, part of a force of about 15,000 scheduled to arrive by the 
end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Washington, the Senate approved by a 94-5 vote a resolution commending 
the pact negotiated by a team led by former President Jimmy Carter that averted 
a U.S. invasion by force but calling for the "prompt and orderly" withdrawal of 
U.S. troops as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. planners had marked the Heavy Weapons Company -- considered one of the 
most brutal army groups -- as one of its three initial assault targets, equal 
to the seaport and airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit was used almost entirely for political intimidation and to stage 
military coups, including the one that drove President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
from office on Sept. 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Its elimination "removes the guts of the army," one military expert said, "and 
certainly means the end of the Haitian army as it has been constituted." 
</P>
<P>
 One Haitian political expert, a supporter of Aristide's scheduled return to 
Haiti from his U.S. exile, literally danced with joy when told of the end to 
the feared Heavy Weapons Company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the heart of every coup in the past eight years. It means that the 
Americans are really well advised, because Heavy Weapons is the symbol to every 
Haitian of the evil of the army," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An officer said Wednesday's action will also ease "the frustrations and the 
anger" of U.S. troops, who mostly looked from behind fences and walls Tuesday 
as Haitian police and army troops beat groups of civilians -- including 
youngsters -- with clubs, whips and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly it hurt morale," said the officer, a captain from the 10th Mountain 
Division and a native of Pueblo, Colo. "We're told we're here to support 
democracy and stop the bloody government here, and then we're told not to step 
in when children are being clubbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This business with more patrols and what you tell me (about the end of the 
Heavy Weapons unit) means we mean business. Good." 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Barry Willey, the U.S. military spokesman here, told reporters that the 
Heavy Weapons barracks in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Frere "will be occupied 
jointly by U.S. Special Forces troops and some Haitian soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
 Other officers said the Americans will be in charge, and that calling the 
occupation a "joint" effort was a sop to Cedras and an effort to head off any 
potentially violent reaction by the Haitian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The American takeover began Wednesday afternoon and was followed by the 
removal of the weapons by U.S. forces to a nearby area where the arms would be 
put on display for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The tough action accompanied even stronger declarations by Shelton and his 
deputy, Army Maj. Gen. David C. Meade, that the brutal behavior of Haitian 
police and soldiers toward peaceful pro-U.S. demonstrators Tuesday "was totally 
unacceptable" and might require more direct U.S. action. 
</P>
<P>
 The warnings were backed up by the arrests of some Haitian soldiers and a 
larger, more mobile American military presence on the streets of 
Port-au-Prince, particularly in the areas where the Haitian troops beat at 
least one civilian to death Tuesday and generally terrorized the thousands of 
people who had assembled to watch and cheer the arrival of U.S. forces. 
Military on Alert 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 Army military police began arriving in Haiti on Wednesday, and 
officials said a rapid-deployment unit will be available to enforce order on 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before those units landed, U.S. military patrols were increasingly 
evident near the wharf and airport, the sites of most of Tuesday's brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 Vehicles and trucks carrying machine guns and heavily armed soldiers moved 
along the roads near those areas, and at least one convoy of Humvees, the 
Army's replacement for Jeeps, drove past the port's main entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian soldiers were also seen enclosed behind barbed wire and sandbags and 
guarded by U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The aggressive stance seemed to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially sparse crowds along the waterfront and at the airport expanded over 
the course of the day into tens of thousands. But unlike the situation Tuesday, 
there were few police or Haitian soldiers in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports that a policeman beat a child in front of the U.S. Embassy 
on Wednesday afternoon, as well as other isolated incidents, but nothing as 
serious as Tuesday's street attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton and Meade met with Cedras on Tuesday night after the incidents, which 
were widely witnessed and reported by international media, and again Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Telling reporters that the beatings, which occurred in front of facilities 
being occupied by Americans, were carried out with "unnecessary force," Shelton 
said Cedras was told in the second session that "the beatings of civilians must 
stop now." 
</P>
<P>
 This was an intensification of Shelton's earlier charge to Cedras, who led the 
coup that drove out Aristide, the country's first democratically elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, Shelton had sought to downplay Tuesday's violence in an 
interview with CBS News' Harry Smith. "I'm afraid that what has happened in the 
last 24 hours . . . has been an over-concentration, if you will, on a couple of 
isolated incidents," Shelton said, "whereas throughout the rest of the city and 
. . . in the countryside, the Haitian people themselves are dancing in the 
street. . . . They are in a more stable and secure environment than they have 
been in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 In another CBS interview Wednesday night, Cedras said he will not go into 
exile, since the accord negotiated Sunday with Carter only stipulates that 
Cedras must retire from the army by Oct. 15 and says nothing about him leaving 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has indicated in the past that Haiti's top military leaders 
should leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. officers in Haiti pointed to the abolition of the Heavy Weapons 
Company as a sign that whether Cedras agrees or not, the Americans "will do it 
on our own." 
</P>
<P>
 Meade, who also is commander of the Army 10th Mountain Division, the main 
troop component now in Haiti, said that Tuesday's action by the Haitian forces 
"was totally unacceptable," and that that is what Cedras had been told. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. generals also told Cedras to stop "the constant and inflammatory 
broadcasts on national radio and television." 
</P>
<P>
 Television has been showing almost perpetual reruns of an anti-American 
documentary about the 1989 invasion of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Cedras was told by Shelton "that Haitian officials must take a 
more active role in taking arms away from unauthorized people." 
</P>
<P>
 This would be particularly significant in crippling the power of the civilian 
auxiliaries -- groups armed by the military and used to carry out the terror 
and killings that have plagued Haiti in the three years since the coup. 
Protests Banned 
</P>
<P>
 While the U.S. military was cutting into the strength and authority of the 
Haitian army, the de facto civilian government made an effort to exert some 
independence, banning all public demonstrations. In spite of the ban, Haitians 
turned out in large numbers in the streets Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager responded, saying: "We cannot support 
such a ban that prohibits demonstrations," which he described as essential 
expressions of the democratic system that the United States wants established 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time," Schrager said, "we hope there will not be provocative 
demonstrations, such as rock-throwing." More on Haiti

 * THE SENATE VOTES -- Afraid the U.S. military occupation of Haiti may already 
be going awry, the Senate passed a non-binding resolution, 94 to 5, which 
declared its support for the forces sent to Haiti without endorsing Clinton 
Administration policy. A4 
</P>
<P>
 * BACK TO HOMELAND -- For a number of handpicked Haitian Americans in the U.S. 
military, the mission is more than a chance to return to their native land. 
Their presence is part of the Pentagon's increasing effort to focus on the 
political aspects of the crisis. A5

CARTER'S FOREIGN POLICY EXPLOITS CAUSE UNEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON and JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Clinton White House accepted former President Jimmy Carter's offer to 
lead a last-ditch mission to Haiti, officials might have expected the kind of 
help that elder statesmen have provided often in U.S. history -- Averell 
Harriman, for example, faithfully serving the policies of a succession of chief 
executives for almost half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, recent events have shown that Carter is nothing like Harriman or any 
other former President or special envoy. Acting as what many in Washington see 
as a virtual secretary of state, the determined, deeply religious Carter has 
repeatedly injected his own idealistic views into U.S. policy -- sometimes 
bending and changing official policy in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 From Haiti to Cuba to North Korea, critics inside and outside government 
acknowledge that the peripatetic former President has defused an impressive 
series of confrontations. Indeed, it was Carter, The Times has learned, and not 
Clinton Administration officials, who contacted Cuban leader Fidel Castro and 
won approval for the crucial talks in New York that led to the halt of the mass 
exodus of Cubans to the United States earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, however, Carter has sometimes eclipsed Clinton's own foreign 
policy team, publicly criticized Administration policy, sounded an independent 
-- critics say confusing -- -- new voice for U.S. foreign policy and, on 
occasion, created what officials and outside analysts view as new problems to 
replace the old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Now even some members of Carter's own Democratic Party, who applaud the 
results of his efforts, are expressing concern about the impact of his methods 
on the sitting President and on the established system for making and carrying 
out foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 One Democratic senator said Wednesday that most of his colleagues were 
"extremely upset" with Carter's "dismissive contempt" for Clinton and his "even 
more shocking statement" that he had told Haitian strongman Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras that he was ashamed of U.S. policy toward Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's time," the senator added, "for Carter to hang up his diplomatic 
hat and retire for good." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) accused Carter of hogging the limelight and giving 
Clinton little credit for the Haiti agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminds me of why he bothered me as President," snapped Biden, who broke 
off his on-the-record comments and became apoplectic in denouncing Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional Republicans, while publicly praising Carter for averting a U.S. 
invasion, also expressed private dismay at his statement to Cedras that he was 
"ashamed of what my country has done to your country," referring to the impact 
of the U.S.-led economic embargo on the health and nutrition of children in 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Washington, some scholars and policy specialists see potential problems 
in the extraordinary role Carter has carved for himself -- especially his 
refusal to be bound by established policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not good for the presidency as an institution to have two people 
presenting the country's foreign policy," said Merle Black, professor of 
politics at Emory University in Atlanta. "We don't let other citizens make 
private deals with foreign governments and have those ratified later by the 
President. Ordinarily, a President would actively discourage people from doing 
these things." 
</P>
<P>
 When a special envoy goes outside official policy, as critics say Carter did 
by publicly treating Haitian officials as legitimate and honorable after 
Clinton had denounced them as brutal thugs, the resulting agreement "takes on a 
life of its own," Black said. "The President is held hostage to his independent 
envoy. It makes the President look weak. The President is pushed into a 
take-it-or-leave-it situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It presents a very confusing picture to the American people," he said, with 
the public left to wonder in the case of Haiti "who are the good guys and who 
are the bad guys?" 
</P>
<P>
 George Vest, a career diplomat who served as assistant secretary of state in 
the Carter Administration, said it is particularly difficult when an envoy 
persists in conducting foreign policy even after the negotiation session is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the negotiation is over, that's when the negotiator's role ought to 
end," he said. "The President's response to an envoy who won't give up should 
be: 'I asked you to do a negotiation and you did it. Thank you. How we carry on 
is the responsibility of the government.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk to a President when he picks a bad envoy is that he can agree to 
things that go far beyond what the President wants. Then the President has to 
disown the negotiator, which makes the President look stupid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vest noted that playing the narrow role of a traditional diplomat is 
especially difficult for Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Carter is a man who is very sure that he is right. He's a very 
morally cocksure man," Vest said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and -- along 
with Colin Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- a member of 
the special mission to Haiti, said in an interview: "Clinton, in sending a 
private citizen, especially a former President, has to recognize he (the envoy) 
has his own views and there's nothing that says he can't express his own views 
wherever he is." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nunn said Carter "was faithful to the mandate of the President" and that 
the former chief executive's "reputation as a humanitarian and a deep believer 
in peace" gave him stature and credibility with the Haitian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary results from a Los Angeles Times national poll conducted Tuesday 
and Wednesday nights indicate that Carter's rating has risen noticeably from 
the last time The Times' poll asked about him in January, 1993, when Carter had 
a 54-to-32 favorable-unfavorable rating. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll also found that people believe that Carter was greatly influential in 
getting the Haitian agreement accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Some State Department officials have opposed using Carter as an emissary, 
convinced that his repeated public criticisms and penchant for pushing the 
envelope of his instructions have added to an already widespread perception of 
disarray in Clinton's foreign policy apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Carter has played a role, it has not always been made public. 
</P>
<P>
 No mention was made at the time, for instance, of Carter's pivotal role in 
contacting Castro and winning his approval for a New York meeting on the 
immigration crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting was scheduled, the Administration miffed Carter by cutting 
him out of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 White House sources said Vice President Al Gore, acting on Clinton's 
instructions, telephoned Carter after the New York meeting was arranged and 
informed him that his services would no longer be needed because the 
Administration had opened up its own line of communications with the Castro 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 A State Department official said Carter "has sought to be involved in a number 
of other highly delicate negotiations like the Middle East talks, and that just 
isn't on. A private envoy works in some situations, but not others." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Haiti and North Korean crises, however, Carter maneuvered so that he 
was the principal negotiator -- sending some Clinton foreign policy officials 
up the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's missions and the State Department's reaction to them have created a 
deep rift between him and current Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who 
served as Carter's deputy secretary of state and whom Carter once called "the 
greatest public servant I've ever known." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Carter's trashing of Clinton's policies, the President's aides insist 
that Clinton continues to be comfortable with their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he is or not, Carter shows no sign of slowing down the pace of dealing 
with foreign crises. 
</P>
<P>
 He has announced he intends to continue meeting with leaders considered too 
unsavory and untrustworthy by Clinton's foreign policy team. 
</P>
<P>
 He conferred with the leaders of North Korea and Haiti, Carter said, because 
they wanted to have someone who would listen to them and talk to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not excusing the crimes that may have been committed by these men. That's 
not the point," he declared in an interview with The Times. "We opened an 
avenue of communication. These are the kinds of things we will continue to do 
in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said his wife, Rosalynn, worried that he was putting himself in a bad 
light by dealing with foreign leaders, such as Castro, who have records of 
oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carter said dealing with such leaders "is the essence of what we do at the 
Carter Center," his Atlanta institution that houses the Carter library and 
serves as a foreign policy center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work with the Gen. Aidids, the Yasser Arafats, the Fidel Castros, the Kim 
Il Sungs and others who are demonized in our country to such an extent that our 
own President won't even talk to them," Carter said. "We have an unfortunate 
attitude in the State Department that if we disagree with you, we won't talk to 
you until you yield to our demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, almost invariably when I go to a country urging all this acquiescence on 
these leaders, I find that the dehumanization is either unjustified or 
partially justified." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said he is continuing to stay in contact with the leaders of North 
Korea, Haiti and Cuba, and he hopes to play a key role in resolving problems 
that exist or may develop with those countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's style of free-lance diplomacy in Haiti was, in many ways, a replay of 
his mission to North Korea last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Then too the former President was asked by the leader of a repressive foreign 
government, the late Kim Il Sung, to visit his country to try to mediate a 
dispute with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter traveled with a sort of unofficial authorization, obtaining White House 
approval before making the journey. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the United States was moving with its allies toward the 
imposition of U.N. sanctions against North Korea for its suspected push to 
develop nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter emerged from his Pyongyang meetings with a promise that North Korea 
would freeze its nuclear program, then took the Administration by surprise by 
releasing the news on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 He also announced publicly that the Clinton Administration had decided to drop 
the move toward sanctions, a claim that U.S. officials immediately denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's negotiating style there bore many of the attributes he later 
displayed with Haiti: 
</P>
<P>
 * A strong portrayal of his achievement. "It was kind of like a miracle," he 
said of his negotiations in North Korea. Standing outside the White House, the 
former President declared that "the crisis is over," an assertion that the 
Clinton Administration rejected and that remains questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Public expressions of sympathy for a dictator and his regime. "I don't see 
that they (North Korea) are an outlaw nation," he told reporters. "People (in 
North Korea) were very friendly and open." 
</P>
<P>
 * Public disagreements with and criticism of the Clinton Administration. 
Carter announced that Washington had decided to drop the move for sanctions 
before it ever had a chance to look at the agreement. He also said he found it 
"inconceivable" that Clinton had not sent his own representatives to North 
Korea to try to settle the dispute. And he challenged the thrust of U.S. 
strategy, saying that "if I had thought the sanctions were a good idea, I never 
would have gone over there." 
</P>
<P>
 * Denunciation of pressure as a tool of foreign policy. "Pressure on them is 
counterproductive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Praise of the foreign leader's wife, apparently as a negotiating technique. 
Explaining how he persuaded Kim Il Sung to release some remains of Americans 
from the Korean War, Carter said: "His wife (Kim Jong Ae) broke in and told him 
he should do it, which I thought was very nice. She is a very attractive lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as in Haiti, Clinton Administration officials found themselves presented 
with a fait accompli : Carter had gotten a deal, and if they criticized the 
details or the way it had been obtained, they would appear to be opposing the 
overall settlement.

BONES IN AFRICA CALLED CLOSEST YET TO MISSING LINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a handful of teeth and skull fragments almost a million years older than 
anything else in the human family tree, scientists have discovered compelling 
evidence of a new species that may be humanity's earliest direct ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the closest thing yet to the long-sought "missing link" between human 
beings and ancient apes, the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fossils, gleaned from a rugged river basin in Ethiopia, are the 
fragmentary remains of a child and 16 other small, apelike individuals of a 
previously unknown pre-human species that flourished in African woodlands 4.4 
million years ago, an international team of researchers announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This species is the oldest known link in the evolutionary chain that 
connected us to the common ancestor (we share) with the living African apes," 
said Tim D. White, a paleontologist at UC Berkeley's Laboratory for Human 
Evolutionary Studies, who led the team that made the discovery near a village 
called Aramis. 
</P>
<P>
 The new species -- named Australopithecus ramidus -- is a mosaic of primitive 
and advanced features, the scientists said. The creature's jaw and teeth are 
similar to those of a chimpanzee, while other crucial details of anatomy 
suggest more human characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 Several experts who have examined the fossils said the discovery offers the 
first direct glimpse into the era when humanity's earliest ancestors veered off 
from other primitive primates, underscoring the relatively rapid pace of human 
evolution. The remains appear to date from a time shortly after the human 
family tree first branched, with one line leading to modern human beings and 
the other leading to the great apes of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The bones also buttress a theory long championed by molecular biologists who 
have argued that, based on genetic analysis, the first human-like species 
appeared as recently as 5 million years ago -- about 25 million years earlier 
than conventional estimates. When first proposed in 1967, the idea was scorned 
by most anthropologists. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you combine these Aramis fossils with the evidence from the molecules, 
clearly Darwin was right -- humans evolved from an African ape," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny shards of bone -- gnawed by ancient carnivores, buried in silt from 
seasonal floods -- were recently unearthed by torrential desert rains. They 
include parts of the skull, the arm and the lower jaw of a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the closest thing to the missing link we have ever found," said Owen 
Lovejoy of Kent State University, a leading authority on human origins who has 
studied the find. "This thing is really primitive." 
</P>
<P>
 All the remains are from the upper body and offer scant insight into how these 
earliest hominids, as the pre-human ancestors of humanity are called, lived or 
traveled. But other fossils found nearby suggest that their homeland was a 
flat, forested plain rich in wildlife such as rhinoceroses, bears, monkeys, 
bats and primitive antelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 The hominids are the first to be found in such a wooded environment, leading 
several scientists to speculate that the remains are evidence that the first 
stages of human evolution, such as the development of upright posture and 
walking on two legs, occurred among the trees and not in open grasslands as 
many scientists have argued. 
</P>
<P>
 The expedition's discoveries were published in the science journal Nature, 
along with research by scientists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory and 
the Berkeley Geochronology Center that examines the botanical, animal and 
geological evidence accompanying the find. 
</P>
<P>
 The fossils were found in a region of East Africa that, during the past 30 
years, has seen some of the most significant discoveries relating to primitive 
hominids. The Aramis area is north of Lake Turkana, where a 
1.6-million-year-old hominid boy was found by Richard Leakey in 1984. It is 46 
miles south of the Hadar, where paleontologists discovered the species 
represented by the famous Lucy skeleton. That species, called Australopithecus 
afarensis, was previously the oldest known human ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald C. Johanson, who discovered the Lucy skeleton in 1974, called the new 
find "terrific" and endorsed the idea of a new species of hominid that lived 
about 1.2 million years before Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very important piece of evidence that says that beyond 4 million 
years ago there appears to be a single line (of descent) and a single (human) 
lineage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, White and Johanson described Lucy and related fossils as a new 
species most likely ancestral to all later hominids. Last year, a team led by 
White announced the discovery of more fossils from the same species that showed 
that hominids ranged over much of Africa for about 800,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of arresting discoveries announced this year has forced a 
reconsideration of much of what was assumed about human origins, from how 
quickly early hominids migrated out of Africa to what may have triggered the 
first use of tools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the story of the evolution of humankind as recorded in the sparse fossil 
record is composed largely of gaps and long silences. The creatures that 
predated Lucy's kind remained a mystery until now. 
</P>
<P>
 The new species was found in a remote area west of the Awash River in 
Ethiopia. In the hardscrabble badlands there, expedition anthropologist Gen 
Suwa, from the University of Tokyo, spotted a single molar on Dec. 17, 1992, 
among the pebbles and hundreds of bone chips from other ancient animals whose 
remains had been ravaged by predators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew immediately it was a hominid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year that followed, White and other expedition members turned up 
different bone fragments and teeth from 17 members of the species. The name of 
the new species -- ramidus -- is derived from the word that means "root" in the 
language of the Afar tribe, who live where the fossils were found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we are getting pretty close to a common ancestor between chimpanzee 
and human," White said. "It is not a monkey. It is clearly a relative." 
Unearthing Human Origins 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists announced the discovery of prehuman fossils that are the closest 
thing yet to the missing link between the great apes of Africa and human 
beings. If confirmed by subsequent studies, the new species may prove to be 
near the root of the human family tree.

CSUN DEAF PROGRAM FALLS ON HARD TIMES; EDUCATION: STUDENTS AND STAFF SAY 
ONCE-LAUDED CENTER HAS LOST MANY OF ITS MOST TALENTED INTERPRETERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amy Yu didn't hesitate five years ago when she had the chance to leave her Bay 
Area home and attend Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Yu, who is deaf, knew CSUN's reputation for running one of the largest and 
most respected university programs for deaf students in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as a graduating senior, Yu is disillusioned. Many of the most talented 
sign-language interpreters who once enabled her to fully participate in classes 
have been replaced by novices, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lucky if I get enough information out of the classes to pass," Yu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, students, staff members and union officials at CSUN's once-lauded 
National Center on Deafness are complaining that the operation has fallen on 
hard times and has lost talented interpreters at an alarming rate amid 
complaints of low pay and difficult working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack is particularly tough for the Northridge campus, which in the 
mid-1960s became one of the first mainstream universities to accept deaf 
students. The center was founded in 1972 and today runs on a $1.8-million 
budget, about $1 million of it in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 With talks on a revised contract stalled, a delegation of interpreters, union 
representatives and deaf students traveled to Long Beach last week to air their 
complaints before the Cal State University system's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators at the center, which has about about 250 deaf students and 130 
interpreters, were not present at the meeting. They later conceded the general 
decline while arguing about specific issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Herbert Larson blames the shortage of funds. "It's hard to maintain 
the good quality if you're not able to support it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interpreters are a lifeline to learning for deaf students, conveying class 
discussions and speaking for many who cannot talk. CSUN's deaf population is 
one of the largest among American universities. By comparison, UCLA has only 10 
deaf students, CSUN officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN has suffered a "mass exodus" of talented interpreters in recent years, 
the delegation charged, due to Cal State personnel practices that deny many of 
them health benefits and pay them hourly wages that are half what some earn 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of interpreters at the campus has not declined. But among the 
80 or so who work full time, the portion at the highest skill levels has fallen 
from about 20 to just a handful, interpreters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials represent the 350 interpreters in the 20-campus Cal State 
system, including the largest bloc of 130 at CSUN. After the Northridge group 
appeared before trustees, Cal State officials agreed to take another look at 
demands for better pay, health coverage and improved working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The interpreters joined the California State Employees Assn., which also 
represents other Cal State system employees, in 1992. When the union and the 
system signed a new two-year general contract in mid-1993, they agreed to hold 
separate talks for the interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than a year has passed with little progress reported. Noel Grogan, 
the Cal State system's director of human resources, expressed sympathy for the 
complaints, but said money is tight. "If there is more money going to the 
interpreters, there is less going somewhere else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many of CSUN's deaf students complain that the problems are 
depriving them of the full benefit of a university education, which federal law 
guarantees to the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's deeply affected me because I have a lot of questions and I want to 
participate in class. But if I can't have direct interaction with my 
instructors, I lose that," said John Sherwood, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I need to give oral presentations and participate, the interpreters have 
a lot of problems," said LisaAnn Tom, a graduate student who began studying at 
CSUN in 1985 as a freshman. "If the interpreter keeps asking me to repeat 
myself, I lose the flow of what I'm saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Students said interpreters generally can translate the comments of instructors 
and other students in classes into sign language, which deaf students can 
understand. That is relatively easy for most interpreters because they are 
listening to their own language, spoken English. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger problem has been the tougher job of converting the sign language 
that many deaf students use into spoken words that others can understand. When 
those problems arise, students say they feel isolated and left out of their 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a complete education. I don't want to miss out on anything. I want 
good interpreters so I can get it all," said Yu, who is majoring in deaf 
studies. "I feel like I'm behind my non-deaf peers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Deaf students from all over the world come to CSUN for the services," said 
Hope Simon, who began working at CSUN as an interpreter in the early 1980s and 
now serves on the interpreters' bargaining team for the California State 
Employees Assn. "But the services are not what they seem to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its reputation, controversy is not new to the center. One director was 
removed in 1985. Another was asked to resign after the center almost ran out of 
money during the school year in 1990. And students were already demanding more 
interpreters and medical benefits for them then. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, a handful of full-time interpreter positions with salary and 
benefits were added at the campus, but those jobs became vacant shortly 
thereafter as employees left and the situation deteriorated, said Simon. 
</P>
<P>
 Major issues are pay and working conditions. All but a handful of the 
interpreters at CSUN are considered intermittent employees paid between about 
$7 and $21 an hour with no health benefits, according to the union. Other 
employers are paying up to $40 an hour for people with similar skills, 
according to a survey of companies in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Professionals say interpreters generally cannot effectively work alone for 
more than 20 to 30 minutes in the physically and mentally demanding job without 
being relieved for a similar period. So a common strategy has been "team 
interpreting," in which two people continuously take turns. 
</P>
<P>
 But because CSUN lacks the funds, team interpreting is rarely used, even in 
classes that run for two to three hours. CSUN has instead taken a modified 
approach, using partial work-sharing in some of the longest classes. Larson, 
the national center's director, defends the practice, but the interpreters 
denounce it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Sanderson, a staff member, said about one-third of the center's 
interpreters had filed workers' compensation claims complaining of 
repetitive-motion injuries. But center officials said such problems could be 
due to interpreters overworking at other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 One outside expert, meanwhile, sided with the interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN interpreters are "woefully underpaid," according to Jane Jarrow, 
executive director of the Assn. on Higher Education and Disability. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-person team interpreting is commonly used and is preferred, said Jarrow, 
who heads an 1,800-member group of educators who deal with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer is the budget's got to go up. We're talking about students' basic 
civil rights here," Jarrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson expressed surprise at student complaints, saying such dissatisfaction 
had not surfaced before in student evaluations. He attributed it partly to the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he conceded that the pay and working-conditions issues have cost the 
center talented staff. But he said the center is caught in a squeeze. Its 
interpreting budget, about $238,000, has remained flat for years while its 
hours of service have risen 23% since 1990, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now stretched beyond the limit," said Evelyn Cederbaum, the center's 
associate director.

'3 STRIKES' FOUND HOBBLED BY ENORMOUS PRISON COSTS; LAW: RAND SAYS FULL 
IMPLEMENTATION WOULD CUT CRIME BY ONE-THIRD. BUT HUGE PRICE TAG MAKES THAT 
UNLIKELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California's sweeping "three strikes and you're out" sentencing law could 
reduce serious crime by as much as a third, but the bill's enormous price tag 
is likely to prevent it from ever being fully implemented, according to the 
first comprehensive analysis of the policy's likely impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The RAND study of the legislation, which became law in March after relatively 
little legislative debate on its effects, concluded that the cost would be $5.5 
billion annually -- or $300 per taxpayer. Most of that increase would go for 
building and operating additional prisons to house an inmate population 
expected to double as a result of the bill's tougher sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 But fully funding the bill's costs is unlikely, according to the study 
released Wednesday, because it would require one of two unpopular choices: a 
substantial tax increase or steep reductions in spending on higher education, 
parks, environmental cleanup and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, something's got to give" in the criminal justice system, as the 
number of felons going to trials and being sent to prison for long terms 
increases, said Peter Greenwood, a RAND criminologist who directed the study 
financed by the Santa Monica-based think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely, he said, the bill's stiff penalties will be applied selectively, 
undermining its effectiveness. "That's ironic," he said, "because 'three 
strikes' was written to take this out of the hands of prosecutors and judges." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the bill, which is almost identical to Proposition 184 on the 
November ballot, attacked the study for failing to consider the economic 
benefits of the measure's effectiveness in deterring crime as well as such 
positive effects as lower insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Reynolds, the Fresno businessman who proposed the legislation after his 
daughter was murdered, said a drop in the statewide crime rate during the first 
six months of 1994 was partly attributable to criminals' fears of being hit 
with long prison terms. The number of serious crimes reported in the state for 
the first six months of 1994 was 7.7% below the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "While RAND is doing surveys . . . three strikes is just knocking the hell out 
of crime in California," Reynolds said. "It's doing the job it is intended to 
do, and the felons doing time today are extremely concerned about their 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bill's co-authors, Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno), cited an 
earlier governor's office study that said the legislation would actually save 
$25 billion in lower private medical costs, insurance premiums and spending on 
security in its first five years. That study has been disputed by RAND 
researchers for its misinterpretation of RAND data concerning the frequency of 
crime by career criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is totally inappropriate to discount the societal savings," Jones 
said. "If we're not able to generate a stronger economy because businesses . . 
. would rather go where crime rates are less . . . we'll never be able to pay 
the bill for the services we are providing." 
</P>
<P>
 The RAND study did not look at how the 6-month-old bill is being implemented. 
Instead, it relied on data from previous studies of career criminals, 
recidivism and crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, a number of the early "three strikes" prosecutions 
involved offenses such as burglarizing a house and stealing a slice of pizza. 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has warned that the system has become more congested 
and that he needs more prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 For comparison purposes, the study examined several alternatives to the "three 
strikes" measure now on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 One such alternative merely eliminated the crime measure's most publicized and 
harshest element, the 25-years-to-life sentence required for three-time felons 
with convictions for two or more serious or violent prior offenses. Instead 
they would be sentenced under the bill's "two strike" provisions that 
effectively tripled sentences for serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% fewer serious crimes would be prevented from occurring under that 
option than under the present "three strikes" provision. But the option would 
cost $1.5 billion a year less to implement. 
</P>
<P>
 Another crime reduction strategy examined by RAND was fully enforcing the 
maximum sentences on the books before "three strikes" for serious crimes, such 
as residential burglary, robberies, rapes and murders. That would reduce the 
incidence of those crimes by the same amount as "three strikes" but cost $1 
billion less per year. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent crime, Greenwood said, it would be even more cost-effective to 
spend money to address social problems such as child abuse, drug addiction and 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The state would accomplish more crime prevention by spending $1 million each 
to steer crime-prone children away from trouble than by fully implementing 
"three strikes," he said. However, he acknowledged, experts cannot readily 
identify children and adults most prone to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 If voters approve Proposition 184 in November, and the Legislature does not 
amend "three strikes," prosecutors and judges will have to scramble to find 
ways to keep courts from becoming gridlocked and prisons from filling up faster 
than they can be built, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 The study concluded that another possible outcome is that younger and more 
violent prisoners who have not accrued "strikes" may be released more readily 
than older criminals who may be locked up for life because they have longer 
criminal histories. That possibility, RAND said, would actually result in a 
higher rate of serious crime.

SAN CLEMENTE INS CHECKPOINT TO BE SHUT; IMMIGRATION: TEMPORARY CLOSURE WILL 
ALLOW 95 AGENTS TO MOVE TO SAN DIEGO FOR OPERATION GATEKEEPER, TO BEGIN OCT. 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Border Patrol's San Clemente checkpoint will close temporarily in October 
so its officers can participate in a major immigration crackdown along the 
U.S.-Mexico border, but officials said Wednesday they don't know precisely when 
the Interstate 5 post will shut down or for how long. 
</P>
<P>
 Current plans for Operation Gatekeeper, an immigration control initiative 
announced by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno during a visit to California last week, 
include the transfer of the 95 agents who have been working at the busy 
Interstate 5 checkpoint, according to Ann Summers, the chief spokeswoman for 
the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Clemente is going to be shut down," Summers said. "When and for how long, 
we don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant Brazley, another Border Patrol spokesman, said he expects the shutdown 
to last "probably 10 days," although the exact details are still unknown. No 
official, public announcement of the shutdown will be made because "obviously, 
tactically that would be a mistake," Brazley said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Oct. 1 start date for Operation Gatekeeper approaching, immigration 
officials are wrestling with the logistics and politics of the unprecedented 
show of force, which Reno said is intended to match the success of a Border 
Patrol blockade in El Paso. The initiative comes during an election season in 
which both political parties are clamoring for action against illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Border Patrol will deploy more than 200 extra agents in San Diego, 
fingerprint all suspects to check for repeat offenders and wanted criminals, 
prosecute smugglers more aggressively and continue installing lights and fences 
at the international boundary. The number of agents actually guarding the 
border, currently about 100 per shift, will at least double, Summers said. The 
Border Patrol contingent in San Diego will grow from 1,000 to 1,400 agents by 
the end of the year as a result of increased congressional funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration officials will also conduct a study to determine the border 
crackdown's effect on activity at the Temecula checkpoint, and the ultimate 
fate of the two stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we are trying to determine the most effective use of the 
resources," said a Justice Department official who asked not to be identified. 
"There has been some debate over the effectiveness of the checkpoints within 
the agency, and that's what the evaluations will be able to tell us." 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians and other critics want the checkpoints closed permanently because 
of safety, traffic and civil liberties issues. They say the forces would be 
more effective on the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some immigration officials agree, others argue that the checkpoints 
are a second line of defense against drug and immigrant smuggling. In addition, 
some agents regard the inland assignments as an avenue for promotions and an 
alternative to grueling border duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Clemente and Temecula stations have accounted for about 13% of 
apprehensions of illegal immigrants in the San Diego sector this year and about 
33% of the marijuana seizures. The 75-agent station near Temecula will remain 
open partly because it is considered an important bulwark against drugs moving 
from the active Imperial Valley smuggling corridor on the east, said 
spokeswoman Ana Cobian of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the potential results of the operation, border agencies expect an 
acceleration of an already-popular tactic: illegal immigrants who try to sneak 
though the legal ports of entry with fake documents or hidden in vehicles, 
rather than braving the rugged canyons of the Tijuana River Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 An ongoing buildup of Border Patrol forces this year has already led to a 14% 
increase in illegal immigrants intercepted at the ports of entry. "When the 
(Border) Patrol clamps down, this activity goes up," said Rudy Murillo, a 
spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, 61 new immigration inspectors will be assigned to the 
international freeway crossings in San Diego. U.S. officials hope to avoid a 
repeat of January, 1992, when an unusually heavy Border Patrol deployment 
spurred smugglers to orchestrate group charges of illegal immigrants through 
the inspection lanes into freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Those mass freeway rushes -- which have been immortalized in subsequent 
California campaign commercials -- were finally brought under control with the 
aid of Grupo Beta, a Mexican border police unit that protects immigrants and 
occasionally cooperates with U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Grupo Beta is among the Mexican agencies with which U.S. immigration 
authorities are meeting to prevent the border buildup from causing violence if 
crowds of frustrated immigrants accumulate south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been briefings at different levels of the Mexican government 
concerning the operation," Summers said. "As kind of a courtesy, (we're) 
letting them know what's up." 
</P>
<P>
 Border Patrol officials say the San Diego initiative is less confrontational 
than the El Paso blockade, in which a wall of agents posted along the Rio 
Grande was denounced by the Mexican government.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN PLEDGES TO FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL OF 
AEROSPACE JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown, lamenting the breakup of the historic linkage between 
Southern California and the defense-aerospace industry, pledged Wednesday to 
fight to save one of the area's big remaining defense operations: the B-2 
bomber plant in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Brown, the Democratic nominee for governor, said it would be 
"disastrous" if the B-2 plant were closed and dismantled after the 20th and 
last billion-dollar Stealth bomber comes off the line as scheduled in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant should remain operational until the Department of Defense fully 
studies and determines the future need for long-range strategic bombers, she 
said. Brown said she had discussed the B-2 situation with President Clinton and 
his chief of staff, Leon Panetta. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am fighting for every single aerospace dollar. Congress must allocate 
sufficient funds to maintain the area's industrial base," she said after 
touring a Northrop Grumman Corp. plant in El Segundo, the last fighter plane 
assembly line operating in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate walked half of the mile-long line and chatted with workers at 
the facility near Los Angeles International Airport. The plant produces the 
central and aft sections of the fuselage and tail assemblies for the McDonnell 
Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, the workhorse attack fighter of the Navy and Marine 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no immediate threat to the F/A 18 facility, but it is an exception in 
the region. Brown claimed that her Nov. 8 opponent, Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson, has moved too slowly to cushion the impact of defense cuts and the 
recession on California industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "California deserves a governor who's got a plan and a strategy and a vision 
from Day 1 and doesn't wait 3 1/2 years for a reelection campaign to get moving 
for the people and workers of his state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson campaign promptly retorted that Northrop was forced to cut back the 
B-2 program because of decisions made by the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even Northrop's own leadership credits Pete Wilson with his efforts to save 
the B-2," said campaign spokesman Dan Schnur. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur faxed reporters a copy of a July 20, 1994, "Dear Pete" letter from 
Northrop Grumman Chairman Kent Krese to Wilson, saying, "You were most helpful 
recently in contacting your former colleagues in the Senate regarding the B-2 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown used the El Segundo plant, which still employs 4,000 workers, as the 
backdrop for her proposal to preserve and revive the aerospace industry in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The names Hawthorne and Northrop go together just like so many Southern 
California cities whose aerospace workers put the area on the map," Brown said, 
referring to another Northrop plant in nearby Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 There are Burbank and Lockheed, Redondo Beach and TRW, and Long Beach and 
McDonnell Douglas, she said, which produce vehicles such as the DC-3 and L-1011 
airplanes and the Viking, Mariner and Discovery spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past half-century, the industry "created a whole California 
middle-class dream. This is the story of Southern California and it symbolizes 
the promise of our Golden State. But in the past four years, it has begun to 
unravel," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Southern California has lost 147,000 defense and aerospace jobs 
since 1990, when employment stood at 330,000 -- a "breathtaking" 44% decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown pledged to ease air quality rules against the use of certain paints and 
solvents in airplane manufacture in the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she would seek an antitrust law exemption to allow competing American 
aircraft manufacturers to work together on the research, development and 
manufacture of new passenger planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur, the Wilson aide, said there is nothing in Brown's plan "that Pete 
Wilson has not already done, is not already doing or has not found a better way 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 At Northrop, Brown was asked if her program didn't sound more Republican than 
Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," she replied, "You got to have jobs. You have to have good-paying jobs, 
decent jobs, that are going to build this California economy. We can't invest 
in education if we don't have people at work who are paying taxes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "California needs a governor who's going to be fighting for jobs. That is a 
Democratic tradition." Political Scorecard 
</P>
<P>
 47 days to go before Californians go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Wednesday: State Treasurer Kathleen Brown toured a Northrop 
Grumman Corp. fighter plane assembly plant and talked about her plan to revive 
the Los Angeles economy. Gov. Pete Wilson signed legislation in Sacramento and 
traveled to San Francisco for an evening fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Brown will be at a San Francisco high school today talking 
about her plan for elementary and secondary education. Wilson attends a San 
Francisco luncheon with fund-raisers and other supporters, then returns to 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Wednesday: Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike Huffington were 
in Washington. Huffington's wife, Arianna, hosted a "Women for Huffington" 
event in San Francisco featuring GOP presidential prospect Lamar Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Huffington remains in Washington today; Feinstein is planning 
to return to California tonight. Arianna Huffington plans to speak at a 
Republican Women Federated luncheon in La Habra today.

 A LIGHTER NOTE 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown, who has been pressuring Gov. Pete Wilson to debate her, 
unveiled a 10-second ad that compares him to a small carnivorous mammal. "What 
do you call someone who won't debate?" asks the ad, which begins running 
statewide today. To the tune of "Pop Goes the Weasel," a portrait of Wilson 
appears and a voice says, "That's right. A weasel." After urging voters to call 
Wilson's campaign headquarters, the ad concludes, "Don't let Wilson weasel 
out."

FOOTBALL PLAYER, 15, TOLD HE'S TOO OLD TO PLAY -- BY 2 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The goal of Pop Warner Football is to give every player an experience he will 
remember the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Pop Warner, Chris Vaughn, a 15-year-old with big dreams but severe 
emotional and learning problems, is definitely having an experience he will 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not the experience that Chris and his parents had hoped for, nor the 
one that the Pop Warner program, which involves 220,000 youngsters nationwide, 
had promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris' father, John, a retired San Diego firefighter, had been reluctant to 
allow his son to play tackle football. But he relented because the boy's 
psychologist thought it could help Chris' fragile self-esteem to be part of 
something wholesome like football. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris, at 5 feet, 4 inches and 120 pounds, had long wanted to play football. 
But there is no team at the private school he attends in Del Mar for students 
with dyslexia, which impairs reading ability. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, Pop Warner worked wonders for Chris. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended every practice, studied the playbook at night, earned money 
through his summer job to buy $300 worth of equipment and played well enough in 
two scrimmages to win a first-string slot as a running back for the Kearny Mesa 
Komets. 
</P>
<P>
 Then 15 minutes before the kickoff of the final practice game on Labor Day 
weekend, Chris' football career was unexpectedly terminated when a league 
official hustled over to him and said he was two days too old to play Pop 
Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris was traumatized and upset, and I was ready to fight anyone I could 
find," John Vaughn said. "Chris was walking up and down the field with tears in 
his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials of the Kearny Mesa league had had his birth certificate 
since May, they had overlooked the fact that his birthday is July 29. League 
rules say any player who turns 15 on or before July 31 is too old. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience has left the son bummed out and the father angry. "It's just 
not fair," said Chris Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
 John Vaughn has tried unsuccessfully to get the local and national Pop Warner 
officials to waive the July 31 rule. As he sees it, Pop Warner officials made a 
mistake and now his son, who takes the drug Prozac for a manic depressive 
condition, is being penalized. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is concerned that his son's problems, which were known to the coaches, 
may have contributed to the last-minute decision to boot him from the team. 
</P>
<P>
 John Vaughn said he heard an assistant coach refer to his son as a "dummy." He 
said he gently corrected the coach about his language, and a week later a 
league official discovered the age discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Schisler, the assistant coach, who lives in San Diego but works in 
Anaheim as a sales manager for Custom Wheel Service, denies ever calling Chris 
Vaughn a dummy. "I would never use that kind of downgrading term about a kid," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also disagreements about the tenor of communication between John 
Vaughn and league officials. Vaughn said the officials were rude and brusque; 
they said he got loud and demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Rikki Kinsfather, president of the local Pop Warner league, said she feels 
terrible for Chris Vaughn. That the birth certificate was not checked earlier, 
she said, is just one of those mistakes that occur when an organization is run 
by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what the child is going through, it's just heartbreaking," Kinsfather 
said. "There is always the possibility of error when humans are involved. Not 
everyone has a computer." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris still wears his maroon-and-white jersey with number 34, like his 
favorite players, Bo Jackson and Thurman Thomas. Despite his problems, he is an 
Eagle Scout, a brown belt in karate, an active member of the Mormon church and 
has aspirations to be an actor or professional athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 A suggested compromise to let Chris stay with the Komets as a water 
carrier-equipment manager only infuriated father and son. 
</P>
<P>
 John Vaughn said the refusal of Pop Warner to bend the rule refutes all the 
higher goals the program supposedly stands for, such as helping boys develop a 
sense of fair play, teamwork and individual challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Even John Butler, who presides over Pop Warner from national headquarters in 
suburban Philadelphia, has been pulled into the dispute. He said his hands are 
tied: rules are rules. 
</P>
<P>
 If an overage player, even one only two days over age, were allowed to play, 
Pop Warner's insurance could be imperiled if there is an injury, Butler said. 
Other appeals in the past have been rejected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things sports teaches is that the ball doesn't always bounce your 
way," Butler said. "Sometimes an official blows the call and you don't get to 
play anymore."

INS BUILDUP TO CLOSE SAN CLEMENTE CHECKPOINT; IMMIGRATION: ABOUT 95 AGENTS ARE 
BEING MOVED TO SAN DIEGO FOR OPERATION GATEKEEPER, WHICH BEGINS OCT. 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 As the Border Patrol prepares for a crackdown next month that will double its 
strength at the international line, commanders are still working on a plan to 
temporarily close the agency's freeway checkpoint near San Clemente, officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Current plans for Operation Gatekeeper, an immigration control initiative 
announced by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno during a visit to California last week, 
include the transfer of the 95 agents who have been working at the busy 
Interstate 5 checkpoint, according to Ann Summers, the chief spokeswoman for 
the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Clemente is going to be shut down," Summers said. "When and for how long, 
we don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Oct. 1 start date for Operation Gatekeeper approaching, immigration 
officials are wrestling with the logistics and politics of the unprecedented 
show of force, which Reno said is intended to match the success of a Border 
Patrol blockade in El Paso. The initiative comes during an election season in 
which both political parties are clamoring for action against illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Border Patrol will deploy more than 200 extra agents in San Diego, 
fingerprint all suspects to check for repeat offenders and wanted criminals, 
prosecute smugglers more aggressively and continue installing lights and fences 
at the international boundary. The number of agents actually guarding the 
border, currently about 100 per shift, will at least double, Summers said. The 
Border Patrol contingent in San Diego will grow from 1,000 to 1,400 agents by 
the end of the year as a result of increased congressional funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration officials will also conduct a study to determine the border 
crackdown's effect on activity at the Temecula checkpoint, and the ultimate 
fate of the two stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we are trying to determine the most effective use of the 
resources," said a Justice Department official who asked not to be identified. 
"There has been some debate over the effectiveness of the checkpoints within 
the agency, and that's what the evaluations will be able to tell us." 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians and other critics want the checkpoints closed permanently because 
of safety, traffic and civil liberties issues. They say the forces would be 
more effective on the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some immigration officials agree, others argue that the checkpoints 
are a second line of defense against drug and immigrant smuggling. In addition, 
some agents regard the inland assignments as an avenue for promotions and an 
alternative to grueling border duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Clemente and Temecula stations have accounted for about 13% of 
apprehensions of illegal immigrants in the San Diego sector this year and about 
33% of the marijuana seizures. The 75-agent station near Temecula will remain 
open partly because it is considered an important bulwark against drugs moving 
from the active Imperial Valley smuggling corridor on the east, said 
spokeswoman Ana Cobian of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the potential results of the operation, border agencies expect an 
acceleration of an already-popular tactic: illegal immigrants who try to sneak 
through the legal ports of entry with fake documents or hidden in vehicles, 
rather than braving the rugged canyons of the Tijuana River Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 An ongoing buildup of Border Patrol forces this year has already led to a 14% 
increase in illegal immigrants intercepted at the ports of entry. "When the 
(Border) Patrol clamps down, this activity goes up," said Rudy Murillo, a 
spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, 61 new immigration inspectors will be assigned to the 
international freeway crossings in San Diego. U.S. officials hope to avoid a 
repeat of January, 1992, when an unusually heavy Border Patrol deployment 
spurred smugglers to orchestrate group charges of illegal immigrants through 
the inspection lanes into freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Those mass freeway rushes -- which have been immortalized in subsequent 
California campaign commercials -- were finally brought under control with the 
aid of Grupo Beta, a Mexican border police unit that protects immigrants and 
occasionally cooperates with U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Grupo Beta is among the Mexican agencies with which U.S. immigration 
authorities are meeting to prevent the border buildup from causing violence if 
crowds of frustrated immigrants accumulate south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been briefings at different levels of the Mexican government 
concerning the operation," Summers said. "As kind of a courtesy, (we're) 
letting them know what's up." 
</P>
<P>
 Border Patrol officials say the San Diego initiative is less confrontational 
than the El Paso blockade, in which a wall of agents posted along the Rio 
Grande was denounced by the Mexican government.

JUDGE BARRED FROM BRUTALITY CASES; COURTS: UNUSUAL DISCIPLINARY ACTION BY 9TH 
CIRCUIT COUNCIL FOLLOWS COMPLAINTS ABOUT CONTROVERSIAL L.A. JURIST'S REMARKS 
FROM THE BENCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a rare disciplinary action, U.S. District Judge A. Andrew Hauk of Los 
Angeles has been barred by a judicial council from hearing any more civil 
rights cases involving police brutality after an investigation of the judge's 
controversial commentary from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The judicial council of the U.S. 9th Circuit also has imposed other discipline 
on Hauk, according to a court document, but the nature of that discipline was 
not revealed in the document. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say this is a unique order and it represents an expression of the 
council's lack of confidence in the judge's ability to preside in federal civil 
rights cases," said New York University law professor Stephen Gillers, an 
expert on judicial discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was called extraordinary by University of Pittsburgh law professor 
Arthur Hellman, who has written a book on the 9th Circuit. "To some extent it 
reflects a new sensitivity on the part of federal judges to public perceptions 
of the courts. I'm not sure whether that's good or bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing plaintiffs who sue law enforcement agencies in 
brutality cases applauded the council's decision, but said stiffer action 
should have been taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just splendid. . . . He certainly has a bias against civil 
rights plaintiffs," said veteran Los Angeles lawyer Hugh Manes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is long overdue," added Donald W. Cook, a Los Angeles lawyer who 
specializes in representing people bitten by police dogs and is one of two 
attorneys Hauk, 81, ordered jailed in recent years after disputes arose in his 
courtroom in brutality cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has reversed Hauk's 
decisions in several police brutality cases. And last year, in one of these 
cases, a panel of 9th Circuit judges ruled that a retrial should be conducted 
by another judge because Hauk's remarks during the original trial exhibited "a 
pro-police bias with regard to claims of police brutality" against the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Long a figure of controversy, Hauk has frequently been criticized by attorneys 
and representatives of women's and minority organizations for what they said 
was intemperate and unpredictable courtroom behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauk did not return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The action of the 9th Circuit council stemmed from two complaints lodged 
against Hauk in 1993, according to a court document obtained by The Times. (The 
nine-member council is the governing body of the 9th Circuit, a judicial region 
that encompasses nine western states and the Pacific trust territories. The 
council is headed by J. Clifford Wallace, chief judge of the 9th Circuit, and 
includes four other appellate judges, among them Alex Kozinski of Pasadena, and 
four federal trial judges, among them W. Matthew Byrne Jr. of Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, neither of the cases that led to the council's action involved a 
police misconduct case. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Wallace issued an order appointing a special committee of three 
judges to investigate charges that Hauk made intemperate and abusive remarks 
from the bench, as well as charges that he is unable to comprehend arguments 
presented to him. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the complainants, Los Angeles literary agent Julian Ayrs, also alleged 
that Hauk was prejudiced against him because he was representing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Hauk threatened to jail Ayrs twice and told him that 
"anybody who represents themself has a fool for a client," according to a 
transcript of a 1992 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauk also belittled Ayrs' efforts to have action taken against a federal 
bankruptcy judge who Ayrs contended had treated him unfairly. "If you want to 
be sort of an American-Spanish conquistador known as Don Quixote, you do it, 
but . . . you are spinning your wheels for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The identity of the second complainant could not be determined. Sources said 
that complaint also grew out of a civil suit in which a plaintiff represented 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision of the 9th Circuit council states that during a discussion of the 
charges with Chief Judge Wallace, Hauk was "very penitent and acknowledged the 
inappropriateness of his conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Hauk, according to the decision, has promised to be careful to avoid such 
conduct in future cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, "the council has confirmed and adopted the judge's voluntary 
decision not to accept" police brutality cases "because it was mutually agreed 
that these cases have caused the most problems for the judge." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the decision states that "there is no evidence that the judge is 
disabled and unable to comprehend charges against him." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also concluded that there was no evidence that Hauk was prejudiced 
against Ayrs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayrs said he was outraged by the decision. He said the council's findings in 
regard to his allegations were sloppy and ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is quite obvious to any fool with half a brain that Hauk engaged in 
deceitful conduct, prejudicial conduct which was good cause for disciplinary 
action," Ayrs said in a letter to Judge Wallace. "The transcript was 'rife' 
with comments made by Hauk that any layman would discern as 'prejudicial' and 
biased," Ayrs said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Burton, a Pasadena attorney who represents people suing law enforcement 
agencies, said he thought the 9th Circuit council had seized on the complaint 
by Ayrs and the other complainant to take some long overdue action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what has happened here is that they have taken a relatively 
insignificant incident in light of Hauk's overall record and used it as a 
vehicle to prevent him from further embarrassing them and all the other judges 
in the circuit," said Burton, the lawyer in the case taken away from Hauk last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 During that case, Hauk said that 97% of excessive force complaints against the 
Los Angeles Police Department "are either false, ridiculous . . . (or) found 
out to be totally spurious."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; SENATE QUALIFIES ITS HAITI SUPPORT; VOTE: LAWMAKERS 
BACK TROOPS IN RESOLUTION. BUT THEY POINTEDLY FAIL TO ENDORSE THE OCCUPATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned that the mission may already be going awry, the Senate adopted a 
resolution Wednesday that pointedly did not endorse the U.S. occupation of 
Haiti and called for the "prompt and orderly" withdrawal of American forces "as 
soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Passed 94 to 5, the bipartisan compromise sailed through the Senate after 
Democratic and Republican leaders worked out the verbal acrobatics of a 
non-binding statement that declared support for the troops now deploying to 
Haiti without endorsing the Clinton Administration policy that sent them there. 
</P>
<P>
 Also missing from the Senate declaration was any mention of support for the 
return to power of Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who has come under 
heavy congressional criticism for failing to endorse the weekend accord that 
let the U.S. invasion force enter Haiti peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was clear from the debate that relief over this bloodless outcome was 
quickly being overtaken by a concern that the Haiti mission was already in 
trouble after an incident on Tuesday in which U.S. forces watched as Haitian 
police clubbed pro-American demonstrators in Port-au-Prince, beating at least 
one person to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Events yesterday showed the dangers of occupying Haiti," Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said, adding that the "graphic Haitian-on-Haitian 
violence" could draw U.S. forces into a situation similar to one they faced 
last year in Somalia, where they became enmeshed in clan warfare and eventually 
outstayed their welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats were also clearly disturbed by the outbreak of violence so soon 
after the arrival of the first U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), a strong intervention supporter, said it was 
prudent for American commanders to avoid any actions that might provoke a 
military response from Haiti's armed forces before more U.S. troops arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that the rules of engagement need to be changed as soon as 
possible to give the troops "a freer hand to deal with these kinds of 
situations when they occur in front of their faces." 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution adopted Wednesday, with only five dissenting GOP votes, 
temporarily averted a partisan clash that could have prevented the Senate from 
going on record as supporting the forces sent to Haiti, as the House did in a 
similar resolution passed earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier version proposed by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) had been rejected by Republicans because they feared that its wording 
could have been seen as supporting Clinton's decision to send the troops to 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The final language said only that the Senate "fully supports the men and women 
of the United States armed forces in Haiti" along with their "prompt and 
orderly withdrawal . . . as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 It called for lifting U.S. economic sanctions against Haiti "without delay" 
and credited former President Jimmy Carter and the delegation he led to Haiti 
with avoiding "the loss of American lives" by negotiating the accord that let 
troops enter Haiti unopposed in return for allowing the Haitian junta to delay 
its departure from office until Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Republicans' insistence, the resolution offered scant praise for 
Clinton, commending him only for sending the Carter delegation to Haiti and not 
even mentioning him by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democrats agreed to the changes to make the resolution bipartisan, 
the conditions the Republicans attached for their acceptance drew an angry 
blast from Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 He complained of their "grudging unwillingness to recognize that it was 
Clinton" who sent the delegation to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not only Republicans who were expressing reservations about the 
intervention, its costs and, to many lawmakers, the still-muddled mission now 
faced by the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) said he remained "very skeptical" that U.S. forces 
should be saddled with the task of trying to bring democracy and stability to a 
poor country with a history of violence and repression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our armed forces are not equipped for nation-building, a task that must be 
turned over to multinational forces and international observers" as soon as 
possible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one disagreed, and privately Democrats in both the House and Senate 
predicted that efforts may begin as early as next week to negotiate with the 
Administration a firm date -- probably in the next six months -- for troops to 
hand over their peacekeeping responsibilities to a multinational force and 
begin withdrawing from Haiti.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; DEA EFFORT TO QUESTION ARISTIDE TURNED ASIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department turned down a request last week by federal 
investigators to question exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide about 
an allegation that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the leader 
of the Medellin drug cartel, senior Justice officials confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said the Drug Enforcement Administration's request to interview 
Aristide was denied because investigators had no corroboration for the 
allegation, which came from a single informant for the DEA. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the informant had provided both reliable and unreliable 
information to the DEA in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Political considerations played no role in the decision, officials said. When 
the allegation surfaced in Miami, Deputy Atty. Gen. Jamie S. Gorelick told 
federal law enforcement authorities there to "play it by the book," officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The informant alleged that Aristide had accepted the money from a 
representative of the late Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar with the 
understanding that Aristide would provide protection for the drug barons in 
moving narcotics through Haiti. The same source also made narcotics-related 
allegations against at least two members of Haiti's ruling junta. 
</P>
<P>
 The informant showed deception in taking a lie detector test on aspects of his 
allegations, but not all, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you couldn't say he passed with flying colors," one noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was considerable skepticism about the assertion, for which there was no 
hard evidence found," a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department's undercover review committee denied authority to 
question Aristide directly because there was no supporting information for the 
charge against him, a source familiar with the matter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you do? Ask him if he took a large amount of money from an Escobar 
guy? He'd say no. So where does that get you?" a senior department official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources who could corroborate or undercut the allegations are now in Haiti, 
one official said, and if federal authorities get access to them, the matter 
can be pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no gnashing of teeth at the DEA over the decision," a source close 
to the investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
 It could not be learned when Aristide was alleged to have taken the cash 
payment from Escobar's representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar, leader of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel, was killed Dec. 2 in 
a shootout with Colombian security forces near his Medellin hide-out.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; HAITIAN AMERICAN TROOPS PART OF EVOLVING POLITICAL 
THRUST; OCCUPATION: CREATION OF SPECIAL TEAM IS ONE EXAMPLE OF A NEW APPROACH 
TO WIN CIVILIANS' HEARTS AND MINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As part of a small U.S. Army patrol outside the airport here, Marine Sgt. 
Roland J. Daniel talked and laughed with the throng of Haitians staring 
Wednesday at the huge military buildup across the street. But a shock rippled 
through the crowd whenever Daniel spoke, for as the Haitians observed, here was 
a Haitian American who had come home. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel carefully translated the Haitians' comments from Creole into English 
for Sgt. Charles Crouch of the Army's 10th Mountain Division. Crouch was 
leading a special unit to gauge the mood of the Haitian people, and he listened 
quietly as Daniel described the reaction to American occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a big difference to have a translator with us out here," Crouch 
said, as the crowd closed in around Daniel, who was flown in from Okinawa to 
help the Army as it struggles to figure out what is going on in this capital's 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching as people mobbed Daniel, Crouch whispered: "Hearts and minds, hearts 
and minds." 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday's violence between Haitian police and demonstrators -- conflict 
witnessed by U.S. troops, who did not intervene -- Crouch's mission to make 
friendly contact with ordinary Haitians gained new urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all U.S. troops here were kept isolated Wednesday from Haitians. But 
for American personnel here -- even enlisted men -- it is growing clearer that 
the U.S. operation in Haiti has quickly become more political and humanitarian 
than military. 
</P>
<P>
 And for many U.S. soldiers here, that kind of mission -- including the 
possibility of intractable civil strife -- brought back troubled images of 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 But officers here and back home insist that American forces this time are 
better prepared than ever before for the political and social aspects of a U.S. 
involvement in a troubled land. 
</P>
<P>
 They stress that in planning for the Haiti mission, they studied the Somalia 
intervention and hope to avoid the mistakes they believe U.S. forces made 
there. Above all, the Americans said they want to avoid another situation where 
the initial enthusiasm for a U.S. force turns to bitterness, antagonism and 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, in this instance, we have come closest to welding governmental power 
from all branches of the government, the military, the State Department. . . ," 
said one Army planner. "This is the first time I've seen us do it as a team, 
rather than have the military go off and do its thing and the State Department 
go off on its own." 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of a team of Creole-speaking, Haitian American soldiers -- 
recruited from across the U.S. military -- is just one example of the new 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officers here said the Pentagon combed personnel files and selected 
hundreds of active-duty military personnel of Haitian ancestry to be 
translators and mediators and to tackle other assignments all across Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our duties are not really defined. We were just attached to the unit," said 
Army Lt. Rodrique Alexandre, a Haitian native who came to the United States 13 
years ago and was brought in from Germany to work with the Army's 519th 
Military Intelligence Unit. "Our motto with this operation is Semper Gumby -- 
always flexible," stressed one officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the special corps of Haitian Americans, the Pentagon also will soon 
dispatch a force of civil affairs specialists, largely reservists. Army 
officials said they hope to deploy 159 such personnel to help minimize civilian 
interference with U.S. military operations and to keep key roads open to U.S. 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. troops will not set up feeding programs for the Haitians, but the civil 
affairs experts will coordinate such international aid efforts with private 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, these experts will help in "nation-building" -- a vital task that 
many Army officers feel was neglected in Somalia. The civil affairs experts 
will fan out across Haiti, officials said, to determine the condition of 
government services; assess and repair roads and utilities, and work on other 
parts of rebuilding this shattered country. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even as they tackle this difficult job, the Americans will limit their 
activity so they can avoid creating excessive expectations among Haitians, 
hopes that cannot be fulfilled after the much-promised, speedy withdrawal of 
U.S. forces, Army officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Haitian American soldiers who have been recruited to work here, 
they said there is almost a surreal quality to their return. They said they 
strongly support the American intervention and believe that, while the return 
of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will not solve Haiti's problems, it 
will be an improvement over the military dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people I talk to are scared, and they want to know how long we are going 
to stay to help them," Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Haitian American soldiers, personal concerns weigh almost as heavily 
on their minds as the larger political issues. And those concerns tell much 
about conditions here. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel, for instance, said he won't contact relatives, some of whom live just 
a few miles from the U.S. base at the airport; he fears that if other Haitians 
know of their connection to him, his relatives may face retribution after U.S. 
troops leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," Daniel observed, looking past the concertina wire surrounding the 
airport at the crowd of Haitians, "I was in Saudi Arabia and I was in Somalia 
to help people. So I figured, 'Why not help out here too?' But even though this 
used to be my home, I always remember that I'm on one side of the wire and they 
are on the other, and that wire is there for the security of me and my people 
wearing green."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; U.S. FORCES IN CAP HAITIEN CONFRONT A DIFFICULT MOP-UP

 Pfc. Joe Gowans from New York was trying hard to keep his cool. 
</P>
<P>
 The road was full of human excrement, urine and the putrid remains of orange 
rinds left from Wednesday's meals in this northern Haitian city. The piles were 
as high as a man's head. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the intersection of Rue Lafoset and Bridge No. 9, hundreds of Haitians 
were surging around Gowans and his tank crew. 
</P>
<P>
 All day long, men, women and children in rags and bare feet had been pushing 
forward to see the miracle of 20th-Century American know-how that the Marines 
had brought with them to this Caribbean island nation: a garbage truck. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Marines landed here in Haiti's second-largest city, securing 
the airfield and seaport. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, they began to fan out on street patrols. Wednesday was also 
trash day, something the poor of Cap Haitien had never seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Their garbage -- what the dogs, goats and roosters did not get -- had clogged 
the streets for weeks and months, probably longer. Bicycle and pedestrian 
traffic was almost at a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Marines, including 24-year-old Gowans, were going to clean it up. As 
his men began scooping up the refuse into a large green truck for dumping 
outside the city, Gowans watched in disbelief at what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women in the crowd quickly urinated on the piles one last time before 
the trash could be removed. Children ran through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you feel anything about these people?" Gowans asked. "They made this 
mess, and now we've got to clean it up. . . . We can help them. But we can't do 
it all, and they've got to help themselves, and I don't know if they can." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the city, Marines and the people of Cap Haitien were trying to 
learn to live with one another as hover landing craft and Black Hawk 
helicopters continued to arrive in this Third World Hades. Gawkers remained, 
but many residents were growing restless not so much over seeing so many 
Marines as hearing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much longer?" yelled one man, his gray shirt dark with sweat, his breath 
heavy with the smell of bad rum. "How much longer do we have to hear that?" he 
yelled, pointing to the Cobra helicopters chop-chopping overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Marine compound at the seaport, Rear Adm. William Wright IV said a 
force of 1,300 Marines supported by 130 armored vehicles will remain in Cap 
Haitien until the weekend. They will be replaced, he added, by 5,000 Army 
troops from the 10th Mountain Division. The soldiers are to perform 
peacekeeping duties as the U.S. military settles in. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright is running the amphibious Marine landing here. On Wednesday afternoon, 
he hosted Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, the overall U.S. commander in Haiti, and U.S. 
Ambassador William L. Swing on a tour of operations in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton had met earlier in the day with Haitian army chief Raoul Cedras in 
Port-au-Prince to deliver the message that the United States will not tolerate 
any human rights abuses such as the beatings of peaceful demonstrators by local 
police and army troops that occurred in the capital on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told him that we think that kind of thing is deplorable," Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Swing noted that Cap Haitien is isolated and not as tightly controlled by the 
military regime in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we have a whole caseload of things we still have to do here," Swing said. 
"And so far we have only uncorked the bottle." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said in an interview that the landing Tuesday took 12 hours. But he 
stressed how relieved military officials were that the landing occurred in 
daylight and was not a nighttime invasion, as originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
 With the dense population crowded into swampland slums, he said, a night 
invasion would probably have caused numerous casualties as Marines groped their 
way through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been very, very difficult," he said. "I am sure we would have 
had some firefights with colossal damage. It's frightening to think about it. 
So I guess some of these things in life have a way of working out."  
</P>
<P>
 The admiral said the only medical attention needed by any Marines had been for 
heatstroke that occurred as they dug trenches for hours in the humid, tropical 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that there have only been two problems with local residents. A Cap 
Haitien policeman who was being jeered by a large crowd at the port drew his 
weapon, crouched and threatened to fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Marine stepped in and drew his weapon and told him he would not allow that 
kind of thing," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second incident, Marines broke up a fight in which a woman was being 
beaten on the head with a whip. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as this ended, the crowd cheered us," Capt. Rich Diddams said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no cheering for Gowans and his dump truck, but Sgt. Douglas Wilbert, 
28, from Princeton, Iowa, said he felt good about this operation nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
 He said even being a garbage man is a form of humanitarian assistance: "We're 
serving our purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Gowans agreed, saying, "We could have been picking up bodies off the street."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; IN POLICY CHANGE, U.S. TROOPS IN EFFECT TO SUPERVISE 
HAITIAN POLICE; MILITARY: REVERSAL FOLLOWS TV FOOTAGE OF AMERICAN FORCES 
WATCHING AS MAN IS BEATEN TO DEATH IN ISLAND NATION'S CAPITAL.

<P>
 The Clinton Administration, scrambling to avoid further embarrassing incidents 
of violence in Haiti, announced Wednesday that U.S. military police in effect 
will supervise Haitian police and intervene if necessary to stop abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In an abrupt turnabout, the Pentagon said that more than 1,000 American MPs 
newly landed on the island will be deployed to accompany Haitian police at 
"every level" of operations, with the power to call in U.S. forces, if needed, 
to prevent excessive use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, also had assured Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide that 
American forces ultimately will ensure that Haiti's civilian militia is fully 
disarmed and disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy change came after the Administration was sharply criticized for 
incidents Tuesday in which American combat troops were forced to stand by while 
club-wielding Haitian police waded into throngs of people, beating at least one 
man to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials insisted then that, under the agreement worked out by a 
delegation led by former President Jimmy Carter, American forces would be 
required to leave day-to-day police functions in the hands of the Haitian 
military and could not intervene to stop such excesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday, after footage of the beatings by the Haitian police was 
broadcast by U.S. television networks, the Administration announced that it 
would begin cracking down on the situation, despite what officials had said the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry said U.S. military police "will have the 
specific function of overseeing and monitoring the functioning of the Haiti 
police force to ensure that they do not use unreasonable restraint in trying to 
deal with crowd control problems." 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted pointedly that the MPs will be able to call in a new 
rapid-deployment force, equipped with Bradley fighting vehicles, if any 
situation gets out of hand. "We deplore the abhorrent acts of violence that 
took place yesterday," Perry told Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said there were no deaths or injuries from beatings in Haiti on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States also told Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the Haitian strongman, that 
excessive violence by Haitian police would be unacceptable to the 
Administration and that police must stop beating and shooting ordinary 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, the American commander in 
Haiti, personally warned Cedras on the issue in a special meeting in 
Port-au-Prince on Wednesday. They said Cedras agreed to order the Haitian 
police to alter their tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration spokesmen insisted the new measures did not signal any change 
in rules of engagement for U.S. forces but merely "accelerated" by a few days 
previous plans to deploy American MPs on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 They also portrayed this use of American MPs as a temporary move, designed to 
keep Haitian police in check until peacekeeping duties are handed over to a 
multinational U.N. force -- probably as early as next week, according to some 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Jared Bates, deputy operations director of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, conceded that, under the new policy, U.S. soldiers who 
witnessed a severe beating of a Haitian civilian "would intervene." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Pentagon officials conceded that the situation remains fraught with 
risk, particularly if U.S. MPs end up clashing with Haitian police, embroiling 
American forces in the civil strife that has existed since Aristide was forced 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Military planners have said repeatedly that they want to avoid the "mission 
creep" that overtook American forces in Somalia, when orders that U.S. forces 
hunt down Somali clan leader Mohammed Farah Aidid ended in a disastrous 
firefight that killed 18 U.S. Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior military officer who briefed reporters Wednesday skirted a question 
about whether the new use of U.S. MPs amounts to "mission creep," while other 
officials expressed concern that the move might bring new risks. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials declined to elaborate on Shalikashvili's assurances to Aristide 
that American forces will ensure that Haiti's civilian militia ultimately is 
disarmed and disbanded, but that too amounted to a change from earlier policy. 
Officials had indicated that Washington would try to persuade the Haitian 
military to do the job, rather than having U.S. forces carry out the disarming 
of the civilian militia. 
</P>
<P>
 Also undecided was how far U.S. commanders might go in prohibiting public 
demonstrations in Haiti -- another move being considered to help reduce 
violence by minimizing the chance for confrontations between Aristide 
supporters and Haitian police. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that, in his meeting with Perry and Shalikashvili, Aristide 
argued that his supporters ought to be permitted to hold political 
demonstrations. They said Shalikashvili agreed to consider the request but made 
no definite commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials insisted Wednesday that using MPs to supervise Haitian 
troops will not flout the Pentagon's previous rule against involving American 
soldiers in police work because MPs are trained in police techniques while 
regular combat troops are not.

U.S. TRYING TO SPEED UP ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS; MIDEAST: FOREIGN MINISTERS MAY MEET 
AT U.N. NEXT WEEK. BUT GAP BETWEEN NATIONS IS SAID TO BE SUBSTANTIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The United States is trying to bring the Israeli and Syrian foreign ministers 
together in direct negotiations in an effort to accelerate the slow-moving 
peace talks between Jerusalem and Damascus, Israeli officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to Washington and its chief negotiator 
in the talks with Syria, said a start might be made at the U.N. General 
Assembly meeting in New York next week with a symbolic handshake between 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and his Syrian counterpart, Farouk 
Shareh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it would be good for the political leadership from both sides to 
meet as early as possible," Rabinovich said. "It is correct that our foreign 
minister and the Syrian foreign minister will be at the General Assembly. It 
would have been good, or so we put it, were the two to have met. This is not 
the stance the Syrians have taken until now, so far as I know, but there is 
more than one person trying to bridge this gap." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dennis Ross, State Department coordinator for the Middle East peace talks, 
said after talks with Israeli and Syrian leaders that the gaps between the two 
countries remain so large that he does not know when they will resume direct 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The discussions are serious and they are detailed," Ross said, summing up his 
meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Tel Aviv on Wednesday and six 
hours of talks Tuesday with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus. "I think 
it is also fair to say that we are headed in the right direction, but there are 
real gaps that remain." 
</P>
<P>
 While the United States is pushing both Israel and Syria to reopen formal 
talks after a year's break, Ross added, "What we don't want to have are 
discussions that would be sterile." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Israeli sources, the goal is to have a very public channel at a 
high level -- and a confidential track for secret negotiations whose results 
would then be brought into the public channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who has been mediating between Israel 
and Syria, plans to return to the Middle East in mid-October to try to narrow 
the differences, but he may first attempt to bring Peres and Shareh together in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a symbolic level, a meeting between Peres and Shareh would be very 
important, for it would say to our people and to their people that this is 
serious, and from that we could get momentum," a senior Israeli official said. 
"Beyond that, however, I think Peres and Shareh would have significant and 
substantial things to say to one another, and that would elevate the dialogue 
from the ambassadorial level to the ministerial." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin has sought for more than a year to open a secret channel with Assad, but 
the Syrian president so far has preferred to use Christopher as a go-between. 
Israelis point out that the breakthroughs in their talks with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization and then Jordan came in secret discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabinovich's discussions with Walid Moualem, his Syrian counterpart in 
Washington, have brought modifications in each side's negotiating position, 
Israeli officials say, but large, fundamental differences will require 
high-level talks and extensive work by full delegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin has offered an immediate withdrawal from a slice of the Golan Heights, 
which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War, to be followed by a 
three-year "testing period" while relations are normalized and final borders 
negotiated. Syria wants the phases to be much shorter -- with Israel 
withdrawing completely in a year and dismantling at least one of its 33 
settlements and removing some of the 13,000 Israeli residents at the outset.

VATICAN A RUMOR MILL OVER POPE'S HEALTH; RELIGION: JOHN PAUL'S SLOW RECOVERY 
FROM A BROKEN LEG HAS SPARKED SPECULATION THAT HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED. AND 
DESPITE OFFICIAL DENIALS, INSIDERS DESCRIBE A TROUBLED PONTIFF.

 What's wrong with the Pope? 
</P>
<P>
 The health of Pope John Paul II has become a consuming behind-the-scenes 
question here. Despite official denials that the Pope is ill, an end-of-papacy 
gloom hangs over the Vatican. Rumors abound. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking frail, ever more stooped and limping heavily at 74, John Paul is a far 
cry from the vigorous pontiff who visited Denver and hiked in the Rockies a 
year ago. Vatican officials and American planners are discussing ways to 
curtail his appearances on a planned trip next month to the United Nations in 
New York and to nearby Northeastern cities, church sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior church officials, diplomats and Vatican insiders paint a portrait of a 
Pope troubled by a slow-healing right leg and by difficulty in adjusting 
mentally to his diminished physical capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be hard psychologically for a man who has always been vigorous to 
adjust to the fact that he is handicapped," said one senior churchman. 
</P>
<P>
 By one account, John Paul, who has enjoyed hiking, swimming and skiing all his 
life, is paying the price for having skimped on therapy sessions over the 
summer to exercise muscles in the leg he broke last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders talk of "great tensions" in the papal household, of impetuousness and 
atypical displays of papal temper. Last-minute cancellation of a visit to 
Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, left the Pope bitterly and visibly 
upset, Vatican sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation that the problems with a leg broken at the hip in a bathroom fall 
April 28 are symptomatic of graver illness has been regularly and specifically 
rebutted, but it persists. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior Vatican official who returned from vacation last week says he was 
flabbergasted to be greeted by a rumor-passing colleague who assured him, "The 
Pope is dying, you know." Another top administrator, when asked about the 
Pope's health, vaulted over the question to a discussion of prospects for the 
conclave of cardinals that will elect his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, John Paul, who has bounced back from injury and illness before -- 
including grave wounds from a 1981 assassination attempt -- is stoutly 
resisting efforts by aides to moderate his schedule. Vatican sources say he is 
working normally. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he walked unsteadily and leaned on a cane, the Pope made every stop, 
whether of substance or ceremony, on a long-planned 24-hour visit to the 
southern Italian city of Lecce last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, 28 priests from Los Angeles attended a papal Mass at Castel 
Gandolfo south of Rome. "He moved slowly, but he had good color, was 
strong-voiced and in good form. Afterward, he walked over and talked animatedly 
with us," said Los Angeles Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, who led the delegation. On 
Wednesday, John Paul mounted a stage, again with the aid of a cane, for his 
weekly general audience before cheering pilgrims at a conference hall here. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, there is no cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a mechanical problem of articulation with the prosthesis in his leg, 
but the operation was a success. We are still within the normal six-month 
period of recuperation, and total recovery is expected," papal spokesman 
Joaquin Navarro told The Times on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, spokesmen have been forced to deny rumors that John Paul has 
Parkinson's disease, that he has fainting spells, that he has bone cancer. The 
broken leg marked his second fall in five months: Last Nov. 11 he tripped at a 
private Vatican audience and fractured his right shoulder.

 Peacekeepers in the southwest found the badly decomposed bodies of 4,000 
massacre victims at the scene of one of the worst atrocities in the country, a 
U.N. official said. At least 2,000 of the bodies were unburied, while the rest 
were found in a mass grave at Gafunzo, near the shores of Lake Kivu, said Maj.

 U.N. military officers said rebel Serb forces were withdrawing banned guns 
from the heavy weapons exclusion zone around the capital, Sarajevo. Senior U.N. 
sources said they threatened the Serbs with NATO air strikes after several 
banned weapons were spotted inside the zone. The U.N. commander in Bosnia, Lt. 
Gen. Michael Rose, said the Serbs had agreed to remove six confirmed and 12 
suspected weapons from the area by midnight Wednesday.

SUSPECTED NAZI IN MASSACHUSETTS FACES CITIZENSHIP LOSS; HOLOCAUST: RETIREE IS 
ACCUSED OF HIDING HIS ROLE IN THE MURDER OF JEWS AS HEAD OF A LITHUANIAN UNIT. 
HE CAME TO THE U.S. FROM GERMANY IN 1955.

 Justice Department Nazi-hunters moved Wednesday to strip U.S. citizenship from 
a Massachusetts man on the grounds that he hid his role in the mass murder and 
persecution of Jews while heading a unit of the Nazi-sponsored Lithuanian 
Security Police during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department action, portrayed as "one of the most important Nazi 
cases brought anywhere in the world in recent history," illustrated the crucial 
value of records that had been under Soviet control and out of the reach of 
federal investigators for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Aleksandras Lileikis, 87, who allegedly ran the Saugumas -- or security police 
-- in Vilnius Province of Lithuania, immigrated to the United States from 
Germany in 1955 under the Refugee Relief Act and became a naturalized citizen 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Eli M. Rosenbaum, acting director of the Justice Department's office of 
special investigations, described Lileikis, a retired publishing company 
employee, as "a senior-level perpetrator of the Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum said that before the Lithuanian records became available, the 
Nazi-hunting unit had been looking into whether Lileikis had lied in denying 
his wartime role, but they had been "stymied by the inability to get hard 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Opening of archives in Eastern and Central Europe in 1991 produced "a 
veritable treasure of evidentiary riches," Rosenbaum said. "We're able to make 
cases that would have been impossible to put together." The Lileikis case is a 
"prime example of what access has made possible." 
</P>
<P>
 At his Norwood, Mass., home, Lileikis repeatedly told reporters "no comment" 
Wednesday, then slammed the door, the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In a denaturalization complaint filed Wednesday in federal court in Boston, 
the government claimed that from August, 1941, until the German occupation of 
Lithuania ended in July, 1944, Lileikis directed his security force to seek out 
and arrest Jews who violated Nazi anti-Jewish decrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 100 Saugumas plainclothes officers under Lileikis' command 
focused on Jews who escaped or attempted to escape from the barbed 
wire-enclosed ghettos in which they had been interned under "catastrophically 
inhumane" conditions, according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint cited several instances in 1941 when Lileikis turned over Jews 
to the so-called Lithuanian "special detachment," with full knowledge that the 
unit served as an execution squad. The allegations are based on captured Axis 
documents currently located in the Lithuanian State Archives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best evidence against Mr. Lileikis is his own signature on one after 
another captured Nazi document," Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 The genocidal campaign launched by the Nazis in the summer of 1941 killed at 
least 55,000 of Vilnius' 60,000 Jewish residents. During much of the 19th 
Century and continuing until the Nazi invasion, Vilnius and Warsaw were 
Europe's two preeminent centers of Jewish cultural, intellectual, religious and 
political life, the Justice Department noted in its announcement of the action 
against Lileikis. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims were forcibly transported, often on foot, to the Paneriai 
woods about six miles outside of Vilnius, where large pits were used for mass 
executions, according to captured records preserved at the archives. There the 
Jews were shot to death, usually by special detachment members. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint cited Lileikis' written "decision" on Gita Kaplan, a Jewish 
woman, and her 6-year-old daughter, Fruma, who were arrested on Dec. 1, 1941, 
for having fled and hidden outside the Jewish ghetto along with two non-Jewish 
Lithuanians who assisted them. 
</P>
<P>
 After questioning them, Lileikis allegedly ordered that "the Jew Gita Kaplan, 
who is being held in my custody, born in 1896, and her daughter Fruma, be 
turned over as of Dec. 2 to the German Security Police Chief" with full 
knowledge that such Jews were "almost invariably taken to Paneriai for 
execution," the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 German occupation records report the mother and daughter were executed on or 
immediately after Dec. 22, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is, tragically, too late for the victims of Paneriai," Rosenbaum said. 
"But it is not too late to pursue some measure of justice on their behalf." 
</P>
<P>
 Lileikis succeeded in entering the United States after failing twice in 
attempts dating to 1950. He was admitted despite suspicions about his past. The 
U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps, for example, wrote that he was "possibly 
connected with the shooting of Jews" in Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
 When questioned before being granted a visa, however, he lied about his 
wartime duties and activities, the complaint alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 If Lileikis is stripped of citizenship, the Justice Department then would 
likely seek his deportation to a country he would select if it would accept 
him. These are the maximum remedies available under U.S. law.

WILSON APPROVES LIMITS ON INMATES EARNING EARLY RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson signed legislation Wednesday prohibiting prison inmates 
convicted of violent crimes from reducing their sentences by more than 15% with 
credits for good behavior and working while behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, reviewing more than 1,200 bills sent to him by legislators at the end 
of their two-year session, also signed a measure regulating advertising by 
lawyers and another bill granting new rights to victims of sexual harassment in 
professional relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's signature on the sentencing bill, AB 2716 by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), caps a years-long struggle over rules governing how much of their 
prison terms convicted felons must serve before they are released. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old law, murderers could reduce their sentences by up to one-third 
and other criminals could shave off half their terms for good behavior or by 
participating in work, training or education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Katz bill requires violent criminals to serve at least 85% of their 
sentences. It took effect Wednesday and will apply only to crimes committed 
after it became law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill represents significant reform," Wilson said in a statement issued 
by his office. "But there is more work to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he still wants to require all violent inmates to serve their 
entire sentences and limit most nonviolent felons -- who are not affected by 
the new law -- to credits totaling no more than 15% of their terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also signed legislation allowing victims of sexual harassment by 
professionals -- such as doctors, lawyers or accountants -- to sue and win 
judgments of up to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, SB 612 by Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), will serve notice that 
taking advantage of a professional or consumer relationship will not be 
tolerated in California, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oftentimes, the victim of harassment cannot easily get out of a professional 
relationship," Wilson said. "This bill will serve as a means to make harassers 
accountable for their actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the measure, a victim would have to demonstrate that the sexual advances 
were unwelcome, persistent or severe, and continued after a demand was made to 
stop them. The victim also would have to show that he or she suffered an 
economic loss or personal injury as a result of the harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure regulating lawyer advertising, AB 3659 by Assemblyman Paul Horcher 
(R-Diamond Bar), will require advertisers to provide factual evidence 
justifying their claims. Ads that mention money awards or depict bloody crash 
scenes will be considered inherently false or misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the new law will protect consumers from dishonest attorneys who 
lure clients by using misleading advertising and decrease the risk of lawyers 
encouraging people to file suits that are not well-grounded.

HOUSE PASSES BILL PROTECTING TIMBERLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House on Wednesday passed a forest-protection bill authorizing the federal 
government to acquire 44,000 acres of timberland in Humboldt County for 
inclusion in the existing Six Rivers National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, sponsored by Rep. Dan Hamburg (D-Ukiah), would also protect 3,200 
acres of old-growth redwoods known as the Headwaters Forest and would require 
study of an additional 14,000 acres for possible acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't want to see these (redwoods) cut down for deck furniture," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, the Headlands Forest Act, passed 288 to 133 and now heads to the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburg said that a companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Sen. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and that he has contacted the Senate Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee about prospects for Senate passage this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful," he said Wednesday. "If we can attach it to some moving 
legislation, it's still possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the land in question is owned by Pacific Lumber Co., which was 
acquired in a hostile takeover by MAXXAM Inc. in 1985. To pay off considerable 
debt, Pacific Lumber accelerated its logging practices, clear-cutting lands 
where it previously had harvested trees selectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill authorizes the Agriculture Department to acquire the 44,000 acres 
through land exchanges, donations and purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition of land under the bill would be phased in, and about 90% of 
the acreage would be available for timber harvest, Hamburg said.

RENO REBUFFS WILSON, SAYS STATE HASN'T SOUGHT IMMIGRATION FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a formal but frosty response to Gov. Wilson's request that President 
Clinton declare an "immigration emergency" in California, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno 
said Wednesday that such a declaration is not needed to request federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno sent Wilson a letter Wednesday in which she said that a special U.S. 
Justice Department immigration fund has been available since June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Notably, neither the state of California nor any of its subdivisions has 
filed an application for reimbursement from the Immigration Emergency Fund," 
the attorney general wrote. "The state and/or any local jurisdiction may apply 
at any time. There is no need for a presidential or other declaration of a 
state of emergency in order to trigger eligibility for reimbursement." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest political sparring on immigration came one day after the San Diego 
County Board of Supervisors declared an emergency, telling Wilson their county 
has been unduly burdened by the cost of services to illegal immigrants. Wilson 
promptly fired off a letter to Clinton requesting the emergency aid and 
criticizing the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, the federal government has failed in its responsibility to close our 
borders," Wilson wrote. "That represents an intolerable burden on California."

LOW-WEIGHT INFANTS' PROBLEMS PERSIST, STUDY SAYS; MEDICINE: SURVEY OF EXTREMELY 
SMALL BABIES FINDS THAT MANY HAVE LONG-TERM DISABILITIES. IT RENEWS DEBATE OVER 
THE USE OF COSTLY TECHNOLOGY TO SAVE THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a study that is bound to fuel debate over the use of expensive technology 
to keep very tiny babies alive, a team of Ohio researchers has found that 
children who weighed less than 1 pound, 10 ounces at birth are far more likely 
than other youngsters to suffer long-term physical and mental disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Their study, published in today's issue of the New England Journal of 
Medicine, is the first to track these "extremely low birth-weight" infants -- 
born three and sometimes nearly four months before they are due -- into the 
early school years. 
</P>
<P>
 The research confirms the suspicions of experts that such babies, most of whom 
would die without neonatal intensive care that costs hundreds of thousands of 
dollars, are at serious risk for mental retardation, cerebral palsy, learning 
disorders and behavioral problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not all of the babies had severe problems, the tiniest infants were 
10 times as likely as full-term youngsters to be mentally retarded, the study 
found. They also fared considerably worse than "very low birth-weight" infants, 
who weighed less than 3 pounds, 5 ounces but more than 1 pound, 10 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results . . . confirm our hypothesis that these children are at serious 
disadvantage in every skill required for adequate performance in school," wrote 
the authors of the study, conducted at Rainbow Babies and Childrens' Hospital 
in Cleveland. "Twenty-one percent of our sample had subnormal mental abilities, 
and 45% required special education in school." 
</P>
<P>
 For doctors who must make wrenching decisions about whether to keep these 
extremely premature babies alive or allow them to die, the study renews a 
troubling question that has been percolating for years. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of concern over rising health care costs, is it worth it to rescue 
these babies -- so tiny they can be held in the palm of one hand -- if they are 
only going to suffer severe disabilities and continue to rack up huge medical 
bills as they grow older? 
</P>
<P>
 "The publication of this data really brings (the issue) into careful focus, 
and sets the stage for a debate on what we should do," said Dr. Arnold 
Platzker, a neonatologist at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. "It's a very 
interesting issue, not only because of the medical science aspect but because 
of the health care economics aspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Just the other night, Platzker said, he was forced to decide whether Childrens 
Hospital would accept another hospital's referral of a baby who needed bowel 
surgery to survive. The baby weighed just under one pound; California law 
requires doctors to provide treatment to infants weighing 1.1 pounds or more. 
The baby's doctor wanted the surgery performed, but Platzker decided against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 He explained his rationale: "My feeling was that most likely we would spend 
several thousand dollars (on the transfer) to bring a baby that would die 
either before surgery or during surgery, or if he survived it would be a baby 
that would be one of these million-dollar babies." 
</P>
<P>
 The baby died. 
</P>
<P>
 Such decisions are particularly agonizing because doctors have no way of 
predicting which babies will do well. "It is very difficult to withhold support 
for a baby you can't predict the outcome for," said Dr. Linda Wright, a 
neonatologist at the National Institute on Child Health and Human Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with other experts in neonatology and medical ethics, Wright said, 
research must be conducted to help doctors make better predictions. These 
experts said the Ohio study also highlights a pressing need for women to get 
adequate prenatal care, which fosters full-term pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
 And they said the research shows that parents, who in conjunction with doctors 
must decide whether to authorize heroic measures to save their children, must 
be better informed of the long-term risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This finding confirms the view that I have held, and that some others hold, 
that the treatment of extremely premature infants is not treatment, it is 
experimentation," said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at the University 
of Pennsylvania. "And therefore, it is very important to realize that parents 
should be given . . . very clear and understandable information in deciding 
whether to treat." 
</P>
<P>
 H. Gerry Taylor, a psychologist at Case Western Reserve University who helped 
conduct the Ohio study, said one of the most troubling aspects of the research 
was seeing parents struggle as their children grew older. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing kids who are falling through the cracks . . . ," Taylor said. 
"It seems to me that if (these infants) are going to survive we have an 
obligation to help them through, not just to say, 'Well, you made it, you're 
home, you're medically stable, so take it from there, parents.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The study followed three different groups of children born in the Cleveland 
area between 1982 and 1986: 68 in the extremely low birth-weight category; 65 
in the very low birth-weight category and 61 who reached full-term. It compared 
children of the same race and socioeconomic status to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings: Half the tiniest babies had IQs below 85, considered at 
the low end of average, and 21% had IQs below 70, which brands them mentally 
deficient. But just 8% of the very low birth weight babies and 2% of the 
full-term infants had IQs below 70. 
</P>
<P>
 When academic skills, visual function, motor function and social skills were 
measured, the study came up with similar findings. For instance, 27% of the 
extremely low birth weight babies functioned at below-normal levels in reading, 
spelling and math, as compared to 9% of very low birth weight babies and 2% of 
full-term infants. Nearly half the tiniest babies were in special education by 
second grade. 
</P>
<P>
 These infants are a small subgroup of all premature babies, accounting for 
0.3% of all births in the six-county region used in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one has calculated the cost of caring for them, Wright estimates 
that the nation spends $2 billion a year on medical care for all low birth 
weight babies, defined as those weighing less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces. The 
figures do not include long-term costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sobering findings of the Ohio study, experts say the news may not 
be all bad. There have been considerable improvements in care since the 
children in the study were born, they note, and if a similar study were to be 
conducted on babies born today the outcome might be different. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wright, more pregnant women are being given prenatal steroids -- 
which helps develop their babies' lungs, kidneys and brains -- when they show 
signs that they are going to give birth prematurely. And premature babies are 
now being treated with surfactant, a chemical that can help prevent impaired 
lung function, which can cause serious long-term health problems. The Tiniest 
Babies 
</P>
<P>
 While sophisticted technology can keep even the tiniest babies alive, a new 
study shows that "extremely low birthweight" infants, born at less than 1 pound 
10 oz., often suffer serious mental and physical disabilities as they grow 
older. The following chart tracks the performance of these children once they 
reach school age, comparing them to "very low birthweight" babies (between 1 
lb. 10 oz and 3 lbs. 5 oz.) and to babies born full-term. 
</P>
<P>

EX-CHIEF WON'T PAY DAMAGES FOR NEWSPAPERS' SEIZURE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury has waived punitive damages against former Police Chief Richard 
Hongisto over his 1992 sweep of a newspaper's racks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hongisto was fired two years ago after officers collected 2,000 copies of a 
Bay Times edition that featured an unflattering caricature of him, but has 
denied he acted with malice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's particularly gratifying, to know they believed me on that," Hongisto 
said after Tuesday's decision. "It's a small consolation; this incident has 
ruined my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the jury found Hongisto had violated Bay Times publisher Kim 
Corsaro's civil rights, and ordered San Francisco to pay $35,600 in damages. 
The city also will pay all attorneys' fees, which could reach hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's hearing concerned whether Hongisto should pay damages. After hearing 
evidence for two hours, jurors took only eight minutes to decide he should not. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert Moore said jurors were swayed by U.S. District Judge 
Lowell Jensen's instructions that they could assign punitive damages only if 
they thought the ex-chief was motivated by malice.

SYNAR'S DEFEAT IS WAKE-UP CALL FOR DEMOCRATS; HOUSE: PARTY INCUMBENTS FEAR 
REELECTION PROSPECTS. EVEN FOLEY IS NO SURE BET. LEADERSHIP MAY PUSH CONGRESS 
TO ADJOURN EARLY TO HIT CAMPAIGN TRAIL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The defeat of liberal Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) in a primary contest Tuesday 
served as a "wake-up call" for many Democratic incumbents and may push a 
nervous Congress into adjourning earlier than expected so members will have 
more time to campaign for the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Already facing the prospect of losing 20 to 25 seats in the House, Democrats 
said they feared the toll may be higher if Synar's defeat signaled widespread 
voter unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows the vulnerability of national Democrats in rural areas in the South 
and West," said Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Tex.). "Maybe it'll be a wake-up call 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Synar, who chaired the Democratic Study Group and was regarded as one of the 
most effective members of the House, lost a runoff to Virgil Cooper, a retired 
school principal and a political neophyte. Cooper captured 51% of the vote with 
a low-budget effort and will face Republican nominee Tom Coburn in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Even House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), who polled far fewer votes than 
usual in a Washington state primary, could be endangered because Republicans 
have targeted him this fall -- hoping his defeat would provide a symbolic 
victory even if the GOP fails to win enough seats to control the House. 
</P>
<P>
 George Nethercutt, a Spokane, Wash., attorney, won the Republican nomination 
to oppose Foley. He was immediately promised financial backing from the 
national party in his bid to oust the Speaker, a 30-year House veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intend to wage a vigorous campaign," Foley told reporters after he received 
only 35% of the vote in an open primary. Four Republicans divided the rest of 
the vote. "I come from a district where I can't and don't take anything for 
granted in elections." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Democrats in Washington state -- Reps. Jay Inslee and Mike Kreidler 
-- won renomination but polled fewer votes than their Republican opponents, 
indicating a tough race ahead in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley noted, however, that only three Democratic House incumbents have been 
defeated in primary elections this year: Synar, Rep. Craig Washington of Texas 
and Rep. Lucien E. Blackwell of Pennsylvania. A fourth House member, Republican 
David A. Levy of New York, is awaiting a recount to see whether he lost the GOP 
nomination last week. 
</P>
<P>
 While some Democratic leaders insisted that the outcome of Synar's race 
reflected local conditions and his tendency to defy the wishes of his 
conservative constituents on issues such as gun control and grazing fees, many 
rank-and-file House members were shaken by the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "It blew me away," said freshman Rep. Dan Hamburg (D-Ukiah). "He was one of 
the best members of the House." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.) called Synar's defeat "a major blow to the 
(Democratic) caucus and a major wake-up call . . . it sends a message that we 
had better redouble our efforts, including those of us in supposedly safe 
seats." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, pressure is mounting on the Democratic leadership to wrap up 
legislative work for the year and allow more time for campaigning. Last week, 
Foley was talking about adjourning in mid-October, but Wednesday he said the 
target date was still Oct. 7 -- a little more than two weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm for Oct. 7," Richardson said. "A lot of us favor an earlier date." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento) said the Synar defeat should not be 
overblown. He noted that the Oklahoma incumbent won just 51% of the vote in 
1992 and this year was opposed by almost every special interest group, as well 
as by Christian fundamentalists and supporters of term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike's situation is unique," Fazio said. "I don't read any major national 
message into this -- the same thing almost happened two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has 
estimated that his party may lose 15 to 25 seats in the House this year, in 
part because of redistricting after the 1990 elections and in part because of 
historical trends in off-year elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats now hold a 256-178 advantage over Republicans.

STATE DEPT. CRITICIZED FOR NOT SEEING IRANIANS

<P>
 Two members of Congress accused the State Department of stubbornness Wednesday 
in refusing to meet with an Iranian opposition group it accuses of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.), and Dan Burton, (R-Ind.), urged the State 
Department to consult with the Iranian People's Moujahedeen before writing a 
report on the Iranian opposition, due in three weeks. They released a letter to 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher signed by 98 members of the House and 12 
members of the Senate saying that the congressionally required report would be 
of little value without consultation with the group. The State Department has 
said that the group sponsors terrorism.

ESPY REPAYS $7,400 FOR GIFTS AND EXPENSES; ETHICS: HIS ATTORNEY SAYS THE 
AGRICULTURE SECRETARY WANTS TO AVOID APEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY. PAYMENTS 
INCLUDED CAR LEASE AND FOOTBALL TICKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy has reimbursed the government and private 
organizations in recent weeks for expenses and gifts ranging from Super Bowl 
tickets to lease payments on a Jeep Cherokee that Espy occasionally used for 
personal transportation during his frequent trips to his hometown of Jackson, 
Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Espy said Wednesday that the agriculture secretary was not 
legally required to repay the funds but that he wanted to avoid even the 
appearance of impropriety. A court-appointed independent counsel, Los Angeles 
attorney Donald C. Smaltz, is investigating whether Espy violated the law by 
accepting gifts from companies regulated by his department. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took the position that where there was even the remotest question about 
his conduct, he wanted to repay it and clear up any questions," said Reid 
Weingarten, one of Espy's lawyers. "He wanted to put this behind him." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent reimbursements totaled about $7,400. They covered nearly $6,200 for 
the lease payments that Espy billed to the department for seven months for his 
vehicle, $700 for four tickets to last January's Super Bowl in Atlanta and $450 
for a night's stay at a resort where Espy addressed a trade association. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Espy said that he had repaid the cost of travel and tickets to a 
Dallas Cowboys championship football game from Tyson Foods, the large Arkansas 
poultry company with close ties to President Clinton, and tickets to a Chicago 
Bulls basketball game provided by a Quaker Oats executive at Espy's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics laws prohibit senior federal officials from accepting all but small 
gifts from companies with interests before their agencies. A strict 1907 law 
bars agriculture officials with responsibility for regulating the meat and 
poultry industries from taking any gratuities from companies the department 
oversees. 
</P>
<P>
 A former three-term congressman, Espy had originally leased the Jeep through 
his congressional office for use when he was in his district. As agriculture 
secretary, Espy visited Mississippi on nearly a quarter of his 89 trips during 
his first 20 months in office, according to records released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy, who has been mentioned as a possible future candidate for governor or 
the Senate in Mississippi, used the vehicle for official business. But he also 
used it on occasion to drive his two children who reside in Mississippi or for 
other personal reasons, Weingarten said. Espy is divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 He repaid the government $6,200 for leasing the Jeep, which he subsequently 
bought. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Bowl tickets were a gift from an Atlanta museum that developed a 
Smokey Bear program in conjunction with the game. Espy, who oversees the Forest 
Service as agriculture secretary, planned to attend the game as a participant 
in the program, his attorney said. But because the museum event was curtailed, 
Weingarten said, Espy later decided to repay the $700 for all the tickets. 
Espy, who gave the other three tickets to friends, had initially reported two 
of the tickets as gifts valued at $350. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Weingarten added, "His presence there (at the Super Bowl) was 
purely official." 
</P>
<P>
 Espy also repaid the American Crop Protection Assn. $450 for the cost of a 
one-night stay at a West Virginia resort in September, 1993. Espy addressed the 
agricultural chemical producers' conference there. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Vroom, the association's president, said that "in a rush to leave right 
after the speech, nobody ever checked (Espy) out and the hotel just 
incorporated that charge on our master account." 
</P>
<P>
 Weingarten said that the association was supposed to send Espy a bill for his 
lodging.

GREAT REDS UNDER $10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are several excellent Zinfandels on the market that sell for less than 
$10, and many of these are often discounted between 10% and 20%, making the 
wines some of the best values on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the following inexpensive Zinfandels are much better than 
almost any comparably priced Cabernet Sauvignons: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Seghesio Winery ($7.50): This is a stunning wine at any price.In a 
double-blind tasting of 19 Zinfandels, it finished second, ahead of 15 wines 
priced $12 and above. The aroma is faintly of jam and spice, but with ample 
blackberry and blueberry notes. The taste is full and rich without excessive 
alcohol, tannin or oak. When seen at less than $7, this is one of the best red 
wine values today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Fetzer Vineyards "Barrel Select" ($9): An aroma of strawberry, 
chocolate and a trace of jam and toast; fairly concentrated fruit and a gutsy 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991 Beringer Vineyards ($8): More delicate in terms of fruit than the above 
-- more like claret -- but with excellent balance and charming fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991 Chateau Souverain ($8): Toast and jam, raspberry notes on the tongue 
and an elegant texture. Top-flight wine. The 1992 version of this wine is more 
oaky and not as fruity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Santa Barbara Winery "Beaujour" ($8.50): This is a delicious 
Beaujolais-style version of Zinfandel, with oak nuances in the aroma to confuse 
the wine snob. The strawberry/cherry aroma is appealing and the texture is 
light. Serve chilled. DAN BERGER

GRAPE BREADS FOR SUKKOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY ZEIDLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a child, I loved the grapes that had been attached to the palm leaves atop 
the succahs . Succahs are the outdoor huts built to celebrate Sukkot, the 
Jewish holiday being celebrated this week that reminds of the exodus from Egypt 
and gives thanks for a fruitful harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 Succahs symbolize the huts used by harvest workers during biblical times. 
Although succahs were also decorated with other fruits, sheaves of grain and 
autumn vegetables, it was the grapes that fascinated me. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that is why, on a recent trip to Italy, I was so delighted to find a 
sweet bread, schiaciatta con l'uva , in Tuscany. Schiaciatta refers to a flat 
bread, and this pastry does, indeed, appear to be somewhat squashed. But 
flavored with olive oil and fresh rosemary and studded with luscious purple, 
black or red Sangiovese grapes, it is definitely worth celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 For the holiday, you can make it with Concord or seedless grapes; while it 
won't be quite as authentic, it will be just as delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Serve these Italian-inspired treats as a dessert or for a special holiday 
brunch. Make extras for friends, who always seem to drop in during the eight 
days of Sukkot, which began Monday evening and continues through next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bar Marconi is just 20 minutes outside of Florence. Almost every day during 
the grape harvest, a large sign appears in the window reading "Oggi, 
Schiaciatta (schiaciatta today)." Their schiaciatta resembles giant chocolate 
chip cookies, with the grapes cooked inside the loaves. They also sell it by 
the slice.  
</P>
<P>
 BAR MARCONI SWEET GRAPE BREAD 
</P>
<P>
 1 package dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup warm water

half into a 9- or 10-inch circle and arrange on 2 lightly oiled baking pans. 
Cover pastry with towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Sprinkle with 
1/3 cup sugar. 
</P>

TEEN TO FACE TRIAL AS ADULT IN UCI STUDENT'S SLAYING; COURTS: JUDGE CITES 
CONCERN THAT 17-YEAR-OLD GANG MEMBER CAPTURED IN BOSTON MIGHT FLEE IN ORDERING 
HIM HELD WITHOUT BAIL IN COUNTY JAIL'S JUVENILE SECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With his mother weeping beside him, 17-year-old Hoa (Tommy) Le was ordered 
Wednesday by a Juvenile Court judge to be tried as an adult for the murder of a 
UCI engineering student. 
</P>
<P>
 In reaching his decision, Juvenile Court Judge Frank F. Fasel contended that 
Le and his companions on the day of the killing had been "armed with firearms 
to the teeth" and hunting for rival gang members when 19-year-old Robert 
Sapinoso was killed.  
</P>
<P>
 Calling Sapinoso "an innocent bystander," Fasel ordered Le of Orange to be 
arraigned Monday in Orange County Municipal Court in Westminster and decided he 
should be held without bail in the juvenile section of Orange County Jail. The 
judge said there was sufficient concern that Le might flee, since Le was 
arrested in Boston eight days after the murder, along with a second suspect, 
18-year-old Vinh Quoc Ta of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Ta has been charged with Sapinoso's murder and the attempted murder of 
Sapinoso's friend. Prosecutors added the special circumstance of "laying in 
wait," which would make him eligible for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso, a bashful computer whiz nicknamed "Zap" for his lightning-fast 
typing, and his friend were at the friend's house in Garden Grove on Aug. 17 
when they saw a passing van they believed had been involved in neighborhood 
vandalism days earlier. They got into Sapinoso's car to chase it and get the 
license plate number. 
</P>
<P>
 The two had jotted down all but one digit when someone in the van got out, 
walked to Sapinoso's car at a stoplight and opened fire, killing Sapinoso.  
</P>
<P>
 Dennis McNerney, Le's lawyer, said he had anticipated that his client would be 
tried as an adult for murder and attempted murder and did not argue against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a murder case, and all murder cases go up to adult court in Orange 
County," McNerney said. "It is automatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Fasel said he believed Le should be tried as an adult because of the 
seriousness of the crimes, the gang implications and because if Le is 
convicted, "adult court can provide a longer time in custody and maximum 
security" that would give Le a greater opportunity to be rehabilitated.

FATHER, GRANDMOTHER SEEK CUSTODY OF ABUSED BOY; CHILD WELFARE: BATTLE IS 
BREWING AMONG RELATIVES TO RAISE THE SEVERELY INJURED 10-YEAR-OLD, WHOSE AUNT 
FACES ABUSE, TORTURE CHARGES.

 The father and grandmother of a 10-year-old abuse victim said Wednesday that 
they each intend to fight for custody of the severely injured child, setting 
the stage for a possible conflict among relatives who are stepping forward to 
care for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I want him with myself," said Eulogia Hefling, the child's 
grandmother, who added that the boy's natural mother would also like to regain 
custody and move in with Hefling so the two can raise him together. 
</P>
<P>
 But the boy's father, who acknowledged that he allowed his son to live with 
Cynthia Medina, the woman authorities say committed the severe abuse, said he 
wants the boy back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted what was best for him, but now I think it's with me," said the 
father, whose name is not being used to protect the child's identity. 
Prosecutors have charged Medina, the child's aunt, with four counts of child 
abuse and one count of torture -- the first time the latter charge has been 
filed in Orange County. They say Medina abused the boy over the last year, 
applying heated knives to his tongue and whipping him with electrical cords. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that the most severe abuse occurred Sept. 7, when, they 
say, Medina anally penetrated the child with a souvenir baseball bat, allegedly 
because he was playing with her marijuana cigarettes. The child was so severely 
injured that he had to be fitted with a colostomy bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina's defense attorney said he believes his client was insane when she 
administered some of the abuse but insists the boy's internal injuries were 
caused by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy remains in good condition at Children's Hospital of Orange County and 
has been showered with gifts from concerned residents. County officials expect 
the boy will be released early next week and say they are searching for a 
foster family who can take him until permanent arrangements are made. Hefling 
said she is still reeling from the allegations against Medina and cannot 
reconcile them with what she knows about her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cynthia has a loving personality. She is a very giving, friendly person," 
said Hefling, who lives in Orange, not far from the home where Medina lived 
with the boy after his own mother gave him up because she could not care for 
him. "I just can't believe what they are saying about her. She loved that boy 
like her own son." 
</P>
<P>
 Medina "cared so much for the boy and wanted to give him a stable home. He 
wasn't abused. He was well cared for," said Hefling, who said she is also 
distraught that authorities have refused her requests to visit her grandson. 
"Everybody is just so, so shocked by this." 
</P>
<P>
 Custody arrangements for the boy have always been informal, relatives said. 
The boy's father said that he and his wife -- who is Hefling's daughter and 
Medina's sister -- raised their son together until divorcing in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's father said Wednesday that his wife had primary custody -- though he 
frequently visited the boy -- until 1991, when she decided she could no longer 
care for him. The father said the child lived with him until September, 1992, 
when, he said, the boy went back to live with his mother. The mother 
subsequently left him to live with Medina, the father said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefling said the boy's mother did not want to comment on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefling and the boy's father agree that Medina repeatedly expressed her desire 
to keep the child, insisting she was in the best position to raise him. The 
boy's father said he did not discover until earlier this summer that his son 
was living with Medina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went straight there to get him," the boy's father said. "But he said he was 
happy and he was in Little League and doing well. He liked being with his 
cousin." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Medina often refused to let him see the boy, but Hefling disagreed. 
"The father has always known where the boy is but made little effort to come 
see him or support him financially," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's father said he allowed Medina to keep his son because his own life 
was unstable. Shortly after his separation from his wife, the boy's father was 
hospitalized for 33 days after shooting himself -- an event he said he cannot 
remember.

CO-AUTHOR SINGS PROP. 186 PRAISES; HEALTH: DR. LINGAPPA URGES LEISURE WORLD 
AUDIENCE TO BACK MEASURE TO PROVIDE STATE-RUN INSURANCE PROGRAM, CLAIMING IT 
WOULD SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The co-author of an initiative that would create a state-run health insurance 
program urged an audience of more than 600 people at Leisure World Wednesday to 
throw their political weight behind a measure he said would save billions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Vishu Lingappa, a professor of internal medicine at UC San Francisco, took 
on the insurance industry and initiative critics in a fiery address that 
portrayed the measure as a growing grass-roots movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, Proposition 186, would provide cradle-to-grave health insurance 
for all Californians by imposing taxes, and, most likely, folding in existing 
government financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lingappa said the tax increases would be more than offset by savings in 
insurance premiums, deductibles and co-payments. 
</P>
<P>
 A single state fund administered by an elected health insurance commissioner 
would pay for medical bills, mental health coverage, prescription drugs and 
long-term care, including nursing homes. The health insurance industry would 
virtually be gutted, with nothing left to cover but such marginal services as 
cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Lingappa accused the health insurance industry of spreading "distortions, 
lies, and ridiculous, outlandish claims" about the initiative. He estimated 
that $20 billion a year is wasted by the industry -- money which he said could 
be directly used for patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 Conscious of his mostly elderly audience, he said the single-payer plan would 
safeguard existing Medicare benefits and add much-needed coverage for long-term 
care and prescription drugs. Without the cost controls that the initiative 
provides, he said, "Medicare is on the chopping block for the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 Lingappa's remarks occasionally were interrupted by applause from the audience 
at Leisure World, which, with 17,000 residents, packs considerable political 
punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative supporters have their work cut out for them, Lingappa acknowledged 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Times poll earlier this month, about two-thirds of likely voters 
statewide said they had not heard enough about the measure to form an opinion. 
After the measure was described to voters, the initiative trailed by a wide 
margin, 23% to 63%. 
</P>
<P>
 Lingappa was critical of the poll, saying it did not spell out the 
initiative's benefits, but he acknowledged that more public awareness is 
crucial to the campaign. Nonetheless, he said he believes the initiative has a 
good chance of being approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure has been adamantly opposed by the California Chamber of Commerce, 
which contends that it would devastate the state's economy -- a notion that 
Lingappa vigorously contested. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Medical Assn. has balked because the initiative would create an 
elected office of health commissioner to manage the state-run system. CMA 
spokeswoman Danielle Walters said last week that many of the organization's 
members favor universal coverage and some kind of single-payer system, but 
believe elected officials have not been very successful in managing the 
health-care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposition, the state-run insurance program would be offered as an 
alternative to private health insurance. Instead of the premiums now paid by 
individuals, corporations and their workers, the state would collect a 2.5% 
surtax on all taxable income up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for 
families. The tax would be 5% at higher income levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations would pay a payroll tax of 4.4% to 8.9%, depending on the number 
of workers. For additional funding, a $1-per-pack cigarette tax would be 
imposed. Other revenue would come from what is now spent in various state and 
federal programs, including Medicare -- the federal program for the elderly and 
disabled -- and the MediCal program for the poor.

WELFARE CHEATS TARGETED; FINGERPRINT SYSTEM CAN REVEAL 'DOUBLE DIPPERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With public fanfare and high expectations, Orange County officials Wednesday 
unveiled a $1.3-million fingerprinting system aimed at tracking welfare 
recipients and cracking down on "double dippers" who bilk the system. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first day of operation, the high-tech fingerprint system -- which is 
modeled after a similar program in Los Angeles -- caught one person apparently 
seeking aid in Orange County while collecting checks in Los Angeles County, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another tool in the arsenal of fighting welfare crime," Supervisor 
Roger R. Stanton said during a news conference amid dozens of welfare 
applicants at the Santa Ana office of the Orange County Social Services Agency. 
"This will prevent hard-earned taxpayers' money from going to people who 
perpetrate welfare fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 Social service officials estimate that the new tracking system, called the 
Automated Fingerprint Image Reporting and Match system, or AFIRM, will pay for 
itself in five years. Of 26,000 applications in the county last year for some 
sort of public assistance, nearly 5,400 were found to be fraudulent for one 
reason or another, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to tell how many slip through," said Larry M. Leaman, 
director of the county's social services. "This system will have a tremendous 
deterrent effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the new fingerprinting system will screen the approximately 3,400 
recipients of general relief welfare payments as well as future applicants for 
the program, which provides a $299 monthly stipend for indigent single adults 
without children. Eventually, officials hope to screen about 40,000 recipients 
of Aid to Families With Dependent Children. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Los Angeles County started fingerprinting adults with dependent 
children as part of a state pilot program. Orange County is the fifth county to 
have the fingerprinting capability. To protect recipients' civil rights, law 
enforcement agencies are prohibited by state law from using welfare 
fingerprinting for anything but welfare fraud cases, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the applicants Wednesday had few objections to giving a fingerprint, 
though the program does draw fire from welfare-rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good idea," said William Llamas, 41, an unemployed parks 
worker from Las Vegas. "There's a lot of fraud out there. It's a good idea to 
buckle down on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Morgan, 47, of Seal Beach, said it didn't bother him at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can cut out the fraud, maybe those of us who really need the help" will 
get it, said Morgan, a disabled mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like Llamas and Morgan, all general relief applicants and recipients in the 
county will place their right and left index fingers on a computer scanner that 
compares the prints to tens of thousands of other recipients in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said the system may be bolstered in the near future when San Diego 
County initiates its fingerprinting program. 
</P>
<P>
 The screening targets welfare recipients who try to collect extra checks by 
using false identification and Social Security cards to file multiple claims. 
Applicants who refuse to cooperate will be denied aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the closest thing to a foolproof system that we have found," Stanton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some activists for the poor contend that the fingerprinting program worsens an 
already humiliating situation in a person's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Shaw, executive director of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force, 
said some homeless clients have complained that fingerprinting "is a little bit 
dehumanizing, especially for people applying for assistance the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he favors eliminating fraud throughout government programs, but 
believes "there is an inordinate amount of attention given" to welfare cases. 
If the state truly wants to save taxpayer money, he said, it could pursue "more 
pressing needs" such as tax fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's climate now of blaming the state's economic woes on welfare 
recipients," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), who is chairwoman of the Senate's 
Health and Welfare Committee, said there are better programs to fund than 
installing a new fingerprinting system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel stimulating job creation is more important," she said. "How much more 
should the state or even Orange County invest" in preventing welfare fraud, she 
asked. "The savings aren't guaranteed and it could end up costing us more than 
the savings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, who participated at the news conference, 
estimated that nearly $70 million in potential welfare fraud was prevented last 
year alone through the efforts of social service and district attorney 
investigators. He said the figure reflects the savings that occur when the 
county prevents a person from fraudulently collecting money over several years. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's news conferences, county officials said the program is not 
intended to embarrass recipients or deter legitimate welfare payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important in our society to give people the assistance they need to 
pull themselves up and get a new start," Stanton said. The new program, he 
added, is intended to ensure that public funds go to those who really need 
help, "and not to the cheats and welfare fraud perpetrators." Fingerprinting 
for Relief 
</P>
<P>
 A new identification system designed to crack down on welfare fraud will first 
be used on all general relief recipients and applicants in Orange County. The 
Automated Fingerprint Image Reporting and Match system, or AFIRM, is expected 
to initially screen about 3,400 from the general relief program. The details: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cost: $1.3 million; expected to pay for itself in five years.  
</P>
<P>
 * Objective: Track welfare recipients and prevent "double dippers" who bilk 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Who will be printed: All who apply or receive general relief benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * How it works: Applicant index fingers placed on electronic scanner, which 
takes a picture of fingerprints and stores it in AFIRM computer.  
</P>
<P>
 * Matching prints: Applicant fingerprints compared against others in system. 
If prints match, benefits may be denied or terminated and a sanction may be 
imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 * System users: Only public assistance social services agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Future use: Officials want to add Aid to Families With Dependent Children 
recipients.

SEAFOOD DEALER ACCUSED OF CRUELTY IN TURTLES' DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Investigators who opened the refrigerator at a seafood warehouse this summer 
discovered they had arrived too late to save 643 turtles choked in burlap bags 
or crushed in plastic containers.  
</P>
<P>
 Red-eared turtles, sliders, Mississippi mud turtles, snapping turtles and 
others were found dead or dying, maggot-infested, with gaping wounds and 
missing limbs. But 724 more were still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the owner of a Canoga Park seafood company who authorities say 
left the turtles there was charged in Van Nuys Municipal Court with a dozen 
counts of animal cruelty, neglect and other offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. Don Cocek filed the misdemeanor charges against 
Mark Rommel Osterholt, 28, of West Hills. If convicted, Osterholt could face a 
maximum of five years in jail and $50,000 in fines, Cocek said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had some pretty gross animal cruelty cases before, but in this one the 
number of animals involved is amazing," Cocek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocek said that on May 19, when a foul odor began wafting from a van parked at 
the apartment complex where Osterholt lives, residents asked construction 
workers to open the van and peer inside. 
</P>
<P>
 What they found foreshadowed the discovery in Westminster: 1,112 dead and 
dying turtles in burlap sacks, Cocek said. Animal rescue workers from the Los 
Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Southern 
California Humane Society removed the dead turtles and recovered more than 900 
others suffering from dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
 That same day, Cocek said, a health department inspector in Santa Clara County 
received a fax from Osterholt requesting permission to sell turtles in that 
Northern California county. The inspector called officials with the California 
Department of Fish and Game, Cocek said, and found out that Osterholt did not 
hold a valid permit to import animals into the state. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cocek, Osterholt had turtles flown or trucked from Arkansas. A 
message on Osterholt's telephone answering machine asks that callers from 
Arkansas leave their numbers on his pager. Osterholt could not be reached for 
comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail then led SPCA investigators to Westminster in August, where the 
owner of a seafood warehouse company, which they have not named, complained to 
the agency about the vast numbers of turtles a customer had left in one of his 
freezers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were in plastic containers, in a refrigerator, in forced hibernation," 
Cocek said. "The turtles at the bottom of the bins had suffocated or drowned. 
There were fractured necks, crushed shells, distorted legs and missing eyes and 
limbs. The majority of the turtles were underweight and emaciated." 
</P>
<P>
 The turtles, which ranged from less than three inches to about 10 inches from 
head to tail, had strained necks and bulging eyes, Cocek said. Some of the 
turtles were in sacks in the freezer portion of the refrigerator, and the bags 
also contained blood, feces and turtle eggs as well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These turtles are sold for food, certainly. However, there are limits to how 
much pain and suffering you can put an animal under," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of their investigation, authorities also uncovered an incident 
that occurred in November, linking Osterholt to a Fish and Game warden's 
discovery of snapping turtles at a market in Los Angeles' Chinatown. The market 
owner told inspectors he had bought the turtles -- which are non-native, 
carnivorous and illegal to possess in the state -- from Osterholt and Sons 
Seafood Co. in Canoga Park, Cocek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterholt is scheduled to be arraigned on Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Turtles that survived the Westminster refrigerator were taken to a shelter 
where their body temperatures were returned to normal, and they were force-fed 
and given antibiotics.

 What began as the agony of three Irvine families became an expression of grief 
from an entire community Wednesday afternoon when more than 500 friends and 
family members gathered to bury two of three young men killed Sunday in an 
Arizona traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Childhood friends and cousins Babak (Bob) Dogmetchi, 20, and Arash Ghazinoor, 
19, were buried side by side on a breeze-blown hill at Pacific View Memorial 
Park during a wrenching 2 1/2-hour funeral service. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were cousins by birth, yet brothers by nature," said Hani Talebi, a 
close friend who spoke during memorial services while hundreds stood outside 
the filled-to-capacity chapel listening to words of tribute amplified over 
outdoor speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The two young men emigrated with their families here from Iran in 1981 and 
were graduates of Woodbridge High School, where they played varsity basketball. 
They were driving home from the University of Arizona with two Irvine friends 
Sunday morning when their pickup flipped over on a desolate Arizona highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the truck, Ryan Lemmon, 19, also died. Arizona authorities 
speculate that Lemmon struck the median and overcompensated, causing the 
vehicle to roll over. Christopher Peake, 19, is the lone survivor of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial services for Lemmon are scheduled for 1 p.m. Saturday at South Coast 
Community Church in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hourlong chapel service, men and women wailed in grief at the grave 
site as the two rug-covered coffins were carried to their final resting places. 
</P>
<P>
 Shookeh Ghazinoor and Shayesteh Dogmetchi clung to their son's coffins as 
onlookers chanted the young men's names. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ANTI-AIRPORT GROUP ASSAILS USE OF BROCHURES

 A grass-roots organization trying to defeat a ballot measure that would 
replace the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station with a commercial airport is 
accusing backers of the measure, including eight cities, of violating the 
Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers for Responsible Planning, which opposes the airport, said it has 
lodged a complaint with the Orange County district attorney against the Orange 
County Regional Airport Authority, the El Toro Initiative Committee and its 
treasurer, Dana W. Reed, and the cities of Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Garden Grove, 
Los Alamitos, Newport Beach, Seal Beach, Stanton and Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is complaining that the airport authority published a brochure 
favoring the proposed airport at El Toro, which backers of Measure A are 
distributing as campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
 The group contends that because the airport authority received contributions 
of $1,000 or more from the cities listed in the complaint, it has become a 
pro-Measure A campaign committee and thus is required to file campaign reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have filed a statement of organization and periodic campaign 
reports. They haven't done so, and we believe this violates the Political 
Reform Act," the group's spokesman, Jeffrey Adler, said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Councilman Mark Leyes, chairman of the airport authority, denied 
the allegations, contending that the authority's interest in building an 
airport at El Toro predated the initiative efforts and is entirely separate 
from any political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have studied the issue of airport capacity in Orange County and agreed 
with other reputable organizations that John Wayne Airport is incapable of 
meeting future demand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not using public resources to promote the initiative," he said, adding 
that any brochures that Measure A backers have used in their campaign were 
purchased from the airport authority. LESLIE BERKMAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; RESOLUTION OBJECTING TO LANDFILL 
PLAN PASSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has passed a resolution objecting to a county proposal to 
pile trash in the county's Prima Deshecha Landfill 80 feet above a ridgeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members contend that residents north of the landfill would be forced 
to look at a 4,500-foot-long plateau of rubbish as it rises over several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The county proposal includes increasing the landfill's capacity to 103 million 
cubic yards from 81 million cubic yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted Tuesday to forward its objections about a draft 
environmental report on the plan. The city is also concerned that the report 
doesn't adequately deal with increased truck traffic and noise on Ortega 
Highway, the only main road to the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 More than three dozen residents attended the council meeting Tuesday night, 
and many of them clutched information flyers printed by the city. The flyers 
contain a sample letter that people are encouraged to write to county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider the landfill plan as 
early as December. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let this go down the road before it's too late and it gets rammed down 
our throats," Councilman Gil Jones urged the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he is concerned that the landfill could become a home for garbage 
from areas other than South County. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jeff Vasquez said he is less worried about the proposal to increase 
the landfill's capacity, calling it an inevitable part of growth. However, he 
did not oppose the resolution, which was approved 5 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill, south of Ortega Highway and east of Interstate 5, has been in 
use since 1976, handling municipal solid waste from South County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the 1,530-acre landfill is in San Juan Capistrano, while a 
small portion -- 133 acres -- is in San Clemente, with the remaining acreage on 
unincorporated county land. JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; UCI PROFESSOR WINS INTERNATIONAL AWARD

<P>
 One of UC Irvine's preeminent professors has received an international award 
recognizing his work to improve the living standards of the world's population, 
university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 F. Sherwood Rowland, founding chairman of UCI's chemistry department, was 
presented with the 1994 Albert Einstein World Award of Science from the World 
Cultural Council on Monday, UCI spokeswoman Cynthia Morris said.The prize, 
consisting of a medal and a cash award of $10,000, was given to Rowland at an 
international conference in Chambery, France. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland lectured at the conference about his well-known work in linking 
man-made chlorofluorocarbon gases -- which were frequently used as aerosol 
propellants -- with ozone layer depletion, Morris said. Along with a fellow 
researcher, Rowland discovered the gases' role in creating the ozone hole in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
 An atmospheric chemist, Rowland is currently foreign secretary of the U.S. 
National Academy of Sciences, Morris said. He accepted an early retirement 
offer from the University of California system in June, but recently signed a 
five-year contract to return to UCI in October to teach and conduct research 
part time. ALICIA DI RADO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; CITY STUDYING COSTS OF FREE USE OF CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After urging city officials to broaden a policy granting free use of the Yorba 
Linda Community Center to nonprofit groups, the City Council is now 
reconsidering whether the policy might end up costing the city too much in lost 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current policy, community nonprofit organizations are granted 12 
free uses of a meeting room and two free uses of an assembly room each year.The 
groups also get reduced rental rates on additional uses.  
</P>
<P>
 After hearing repeated complaints from some organizations excluded from the 
list of groups eligible for free uses, the council in July asked the Parks and 
Recreation Commission to broaden the policy to accommodate a greater number of 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, the council appeared to retreat from that position, with 
several council members reluctant to approve a policy that would allow social 
clubs and hobby groups free uses of the building. "How much (revenue are we 
losing) to subsidize these groups?" asked Councilman Henry W. Wedaa. "I might 
be willing, if we knew the financial impact, to vote yes. To vote yes before we 
know that is stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 to approve the policy, which goes into effect in 
January. But the council asked city officials for a report on the potential 
loss of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many free uses are we talking about?" asked Councilman John M. Gullixson. 
"We have to be making it up somewhere." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

<P>
 The city will spend $5,200 for the transportation of seniors participating in 
the Senior Meals and Services program. 
</P>
<P>
 About 18 residents aged 60 and older are taken from their homes Monday through 
Friday to the Youth Center on Oak Street for the nutrition program and to 
participate in bingo and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to have them out of their homes and into a social atmosphere," 
said Gail Silva, the city's community services supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 The city contracts with the Orange County Transportation Authority, which in 
turn has a contract with Dave Transportation, to provide the van service to the 
seniors, Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5,200 appropriation, approved by the City Council last week, represents 
the city's contribution to the transportation program. The OCTA and the 
county's Area Agency on Aging also contribute each year to the program.BERT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; HELIUM BALLOONS MAY HAVE CAUSED 1993 CRASH OF 
PLANE, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A bundle of helium balloons may have caused a private twin-engine plane to 
crash last year, killing the pilot, according to a recent report from federal 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found pieces of balloons scattered near the crash area, and 
investigators concluded that the balloons may have been sucked into the plane's 
engines.They also found that the plane may have been flying too low. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon S. Hansen, a 59-year-old Placentia resident, died in the crash near 
Brea on Nov. 15. He was the only person in the Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche when 
it smashed into a hillside just north of Carbon Canyon Road at more than 100 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash started a 50-acre brush fire that took 200 firefighters more than 
three hours to contain. At the crash site, investigators found no evidence of 
mechanical failure or malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 The report from the National Transportation Safety Board said the pilot was 
flying too low, hit the free-floating balloons and lost control. The report 
does not say how low the plane was when it hit the balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigator Thomas Wilcox said the balloons may have restricted the airflow 
in the engines and caused the plane to lose power. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness on horseback heard a popping noise and saw what looked like a flare 
and some confetti fall away from the plane as it rolled and nose-dived, Wilcox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her statement was so unusual," Wilcox said. "Where the flare was supposed to 
have landed, there were pink and white balloons. The condition of the balloons 
was that they had not been there a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Other witnesses either heard or saw the plane moments before it hit the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been up in a airplane and have seen balloons cruising by," said Wilcox. 
He said crashes caused by balloons are rare. NANCY HSU

 A contest will be held to name a gymnasium to be built this fall between 
Hurless Barton Park and Yorba Linda Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council called for the contest after rejecting two names proposed by 
the city's Parks and Recreation Commission.The suggestions were Yorba Linda 
Grove and Yorba Linda Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the names suggested (because) they don't imply any connection to 
the" Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District, Councilman Daniel T. Welch 
said. "This is a joint facility and I would encourage us to find a name that 
doesn't identify (the city) over the" school district. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest will be arranged by the Parks and Recreation Department and will 
be open to all residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Groundbreaking ceremonies for the new gym will be held Saturday at 10 a.m. at 
Hurless Barton Park, on Casa Loma Avenue. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 Wayne Lewis knew several years ago that his hair salon would eventually be 
sacrificed to the widening of La Veta Avenue and Main Street, but he was still 
not ready Tuesday when the City Council approved the seizure of his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like a thief in the night," said Lewis, who owns Alley Cuts 
Creative Hair & Nail Design. The stylist said he had recently spent thousands 
of dollars remodeling his salon, where he trims the locks of doctors, lawyers 
and other professionals from nearby offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and five other business owners are the first of about 100 who will be 
displaced by a $20-million project to widen La Veta, Main and Chapman Avenue, 
said Gary Johnson, acting public works director. The project was proposed in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as anticipated, Orange County Superior Court grants the city immediate 
possession of these six condemned properties, the stores will have to relocate 
around the first of the year, City Atty. Robert Franks said. All of the 
businesses lease space in a complex owned by the Daum family of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing against the seizure of his business, Sandwich Saloon co-owner Dana 
Daum said the city could not adequately compensate for the loss of his 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's devastating," he said. "What is really harmful to us, as a small 
business, is there is really nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has hired a specialist to help the businesses find new homes and 
offered the Daums $1.2 million in compensation, Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Daum spoke briefly for his family at Tuesday's public hearing. "We only 
ask that you consider our rights as property owners," Daum said, adding after 
the hearing that the family has hired an attorney to negotiate with the city 
over its offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the fate of the six stores was decided in 1989 when the city 
adopted its General Plan.LESLEY WRIGHT

 A 22-year-old man was listed in critical condition Wednesday with wounds 
suffered when he was shot in the chest by unidentified attackers while driving 
his car along South Newhope Boulevard late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Rivas of Santa Ana lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a 
tree after he was shot once with a semiautomatic handgun, police Lt. Dave Petko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the attack was gang-related but have no witnesses. Petko said a 
small white car was seen speeding away from the scene after the 9:05 p.m. 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called to the 300 block of South Newhope by residents who heard 
gunfire. When they arrived, Petko said, Rivas was slumped in the driver's seat, 
bleeding from the gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were still seeking information Wednesday on the identity and 
whereabouts of Rivas' attackers. TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

 The City Council decided that the city could not afford to lose City Manager 
Kevin O'Rourke and voted 5 to 0 to boost his pay by $11,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members took the vote in a closed session this week, just four weeks 
after signing O'Rourke's 10th annual contract and giving him a 2% raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Another city offered to top that $96,000 salary. But the council agreed to 
raise his salary to $107,000, said Councilman Arthur C. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Rourke had asked council members not to disclose which city was trying to 
lure him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody on the council decided we can't afford to lose him," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Rourke, 43, became Buena Park's city manager in 1985, after serving in the 
same position in Stanton. He is attending a city managers' conference in 
Chicago this week and was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is in the midst of dealing with a number of sensitive issues, and 
O'Rourke's experience with the city is invaluable at this time, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to a five-year strategic plan that financial officials are 
developing under O'Rourke's direction as one issue. LESLEY WRIGHT

<P>
 The City Council this week approved a controversial low-income housing 
project, despite opposition from dozens of residents who urged council members 
to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 During a five-hour public hearing Tuesday night, residents complained about 
the project's proposed parking layout, saying it would cause traffic problems. 
They also opposed the $3.6-million project's location and density. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, a 27-unit apartment complex and two-level parking structure, is 
proposed for 2200 E. Chapman Ave. and is being built by Douglas Chaffee and the 
Fullerton Interfaith Housing Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents wanted the city to conduct a traffic study and prepare an 
environmental impact report to determine the effect the project would have on 
its neighbors, but city officials said the studies are not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's things you can control and things you cannot, but I don't want this 
in my back yard," said Joe Tatar, who lives across from the project site on 
Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Joetta Simmons expressed fear that illegal immigrants may move into the 
housing project and said "that should not be done." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said prospective tenants will not be asked whether they are 
illegal because such a question could be viewed as discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency owns the property, which is valued at $780,000. It 
will give the developers a $405,000 grant and a $375,000 low-interest loan to 
buy the land. The loan is expected to be paid back in 30 years, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is loaning the developers another $155,000 for development costs, 
which must be paid back in 30 years as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Rents for the apartment complex's units will range from $426 to $655 a month, 
and tenants must earn less than $28,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Churches from throughout the city supported the project, saying it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is scheduled to begin within months, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Chaffee: "This is going to be a model project for the city. . . . It's 
something that will benefit the community and we'll all take pride in."MIMI KO

 Investigators from the Orange County Sheriff's Department Sex Crimes Unit have 
arrested three men in South County in unrelated cases on suspicion of sex 
offenses against at least four girls, authorities announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Mateo Estrada, 23, a transient, was arrested Wednesday on suspicion 
of raping a mentally impaired 17-year-old girl, according to Lt. Dan 
Martini.Estrada, who gave his occupation as laborer, was being held at County 
Jail on $50,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills attorney William Scott Ayers, 44, was arrested at his office 
Wednesday, on suspicion of sexually fondling a 12-year-old girl, Martini said. 
He was being held at County Jail on $150,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, investigators arrested an Alta Loma retiree, 65-year-old Leroy 
Palmer Silks, on suspicion of sexually fondling at least two girls, ages 8 and 
9, at Dana Crest Park in Dana Point, Martini said. Silks, who had been visiting 
his daughter in the area since January, was being held at County Jail on 
$10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of investigating the incident, Martini said, police learned that 
two other area girls, ages 3 and 8, may have been molested by Silks. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information regarding these incidents is asked to contact Sgt. Hal 
Brotheim or Investigator Mark Simon of the Sex Crimes Unit at (714) 647-7418 or

SAFETY COMPLAINTS LED TO FIRING, LAWYER ALLEGES; COURT: IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS, 
SHE SAYS TWO WOMEN SUING TOYOTA OF GARDEN GROVE LOST THEIR JOBS FOR EXPRESSING 
CONCERN ABOUT THE PARKING LOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Complaints about the safety of a parking lot caused two employees of an Orange 
County auto dealership to lose their jobs, a lawyer charged Wednesday in the 
closing stages of a Superior Court trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Holifield and Rae Lynn Wiggins sued their former employer, Toyota of 
Garden Grove, contending they were wrongfully fired in 1992 for expressing 
their fears about using the employee-designated lot, an allegation vigorously 
denied by the employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Holifield was working in the collections department and Wiggins as an 
inventory controller. They are together seeking more than $62,000 in lost 
salary and benefits, at least $250,000 for emotional distress and punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michelle A. Reinglass told the jury that the dealership failed to 
take adequate measures to protect the women's safety, despite crime problems 
associated with the city-owned parking lot. Employees must use a tunnel under 
the Garden Grove Freeway to walk between the lot and the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiggins testified that she had to seek help from an elderly security guard one 
morning when a man blocked her entrance to the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't fired because they screwed up. They weren't fired because they 
did anything wrong," Reinglass said in her closing arguments. "They were fired 
because they continuously complained about unsafe working conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Terry M. Giles, however, said that there was nothing improper 
about the dealership's actions and that the women were fired because they broke 
company policy by not parking their cars in the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the jury in his closing arguments that the dealership did everything 
possible to address the women's fears, from posting security guards in the lot 
to providing valet parking, shuttle and escort services. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police officers testified during portions of the 2 1/2-week trial 
that the area, bordered by the Bolsa Grande High School football field and 
Garden Grove Park, was not plagued by violent crime, Giles said. The city also 
allows the pedestrian tunnel to be used by children walking to and from school, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that is unsafe, then where can we say where we are safe?" he asked the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors are expected to begin deliberating the case today after the attorneys 
finish their closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinglass contended in her statements that the dealership could have easily 
handled the situation by allowing the women to park in front of the business on 
Trask Avenue, a public street, or on the car lot itself, where spaces are 
reserved for upper management. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the alternatives offered the women were inadequate, including the 
valet parking service. The women were worried they would be financially liable 
if there was an accident while the valet was driving their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 She characterized the actions of the dealership as "putting interests of sales 
above safety of employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Giles said the situation has been "blown completely, completely out of 
proportion." 
</P>
<P>
 He told the jury that the city designated the parking lot to be used by the 
dealership employees after residents near the business complained that 
customers and workers were causing traffic and parking problems in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee handbook, Giles said, makes it clear that spaces in front of the 
business are reserved for customers and that employees are required to park in 
the city lot. The company had no choice but to fire the two women when they 
refused to follow company policy, he added.

VARIETY IS NAME OF GAME IN COUNCIL RACE; ELECTIONS: SEVEN CONTENDERS RANGING 
FROM A 71-YEAR-OLD RETIREE TO AN 18-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE STUDENT ARE RUNNING FOR 
THREE SEATS IN SAN CLEMENTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Generation X wants a seat. So does a former school superintendent who can 
recall the early days of the Roaring Twenties. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, seven candidates spanning seven decades in age are seeking three 
at-large seats on the San Clemente City Council on Nov. 8, an election 
described by local officials as crucial to the continuing growth of the 
county's southernmost city. 
</P>
<P>
 With developers knocking at City Hall's door for the chance to build in San 
Clemente's back country east of Interstate 5, the real estate recession appears 
to have bottomed out, at least in this coastal city of 43,000 residents. The 
city also appears to have moved on after weathering a potential firestorm last 
October when a white San Clemente High School senior was killed in an attack by 
a group of alleged local Latino gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half of the 1990s should be a time for progress, said City Manager 
Michael W. Parness. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a critical four-year period," said Parness, who has been 
the chief executive of San Clemente since 1989. "We have spent the past few 
years working on a new General Plan, specific plans and design standards. . . . 
Now we have to focus on implementing these policies." 
</P>
<P>
 So who is best to watch out for the city's best interests as members of the 
five-person council? 
</P>
<P>
 The choice is between three candidates -- including two incumbents -- who are 
backed by the powerful San Clemente Chamber of Commerce, which has its own 
political action committee and has controlled the local races recently, and the 
remaining four who say they stand for change. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber wants the city's approximately 23,000 registered voters to return 
incumbents Joseph Anderson, 52, an insurance executive, and Truman Benedict, 
the 71-year-old retired superintendent of the Capistrano school district, to 
new four-year terms. Both were elected in 1990 and insiders say both had to be 
persuaded to run again. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber also backs Steve Apodaca, 43, a six-year San Clemente resident and 
member of the Planning Commission, who would be the city's first Latino council 
member. Apodaca, who is also an insurance executive, believes business 
development is the key to the city's future. 
</P>
<P>
 The challengers include Patrick M. Ahle (pronounced ail ), 37, a deputy city 
attorney for Anaheim; Jim Dahl, 51, a longtime San Clemente firefighter and 
former president of the local firefighters association; George Moulison, 57, a 
retired quality control executive, and Jamie Rogers, 18, a 1994 San Clemente 
High graduate who now is a history major at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahle and Moulison have pounced on new water rates as a campaign issue. The 
new, more complicated rate structure recently approved by the City Council has 
caused an uproar, partly because it hit homeowners hard while giving breaks to 
hotel, motel and multiunit landowners under the theory that these businesses 
had been overcharged in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers wants to get involved in local government and believes more people her 
age should be active in the city's political process. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever wins will have much less government to run than in previous years. 
Gone are the San Clemente police and fire departments, both handed off to the 
county in two recent cost-cutting moves that sliced 115 employees from the city 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Other privatizing moves have cut a total of 184 positions, an overall 48% 
decrease in staff. 
</P>
<P>
 What is left is a streamlined city staff to deal with the coming years when 
local revenues will continue to be harder to generate, Parness said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, optimism runs high in 66-year-old San Clemente, a 17-square-mile 
community divided by Interstate 5 and bordered on three sides by the Pacific 
Ocean, Camp Pendleton and the 40,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo. Parness says 
the city has "turned the corner" from the old days of "San Calamity," when a 
financial crisis and years of deferred maintenance to city streets, storm 
drains and sewers ate up all reserve funds and threatened to cripple the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 After four years of fiscal belt-tightening, the city again has a 4% reserve in 
its $21-million annual operating budget, a smaller budget than the one adopted 
by a previous council four years ago, Parness said. 
</P>
<P>
 But things are happening quickly. Centex Homes this month won approval of a 
162-unit development in the city's Forster Ranch area and a 600,000-square-foot 
commercial development slated for the intersection of Avenida Pico and Avenida 
La Pata is working its way through city commissions. In addition, a potential 
college site is being studied by the Saddleback Community College District and 
a time-share project is being negotiated for construction near the city pier.

DAUGHTER TESTIFIES FATHER HAD HIT LIST OF VICTIMS; COURTS: WOMAN SAYS SHE WAS 
AMONG TARGETS MENTIONED BY DOUGLAS STANLEY, ON TRIAL FOR KILLING SISTER-IN-LAW, 
CO-WORKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A father and daughter each shed tears in a courtroom Wednesday, he as he sat 
accused of killing two women and she as she testified against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Stanley, 58, blotted his eyes with tissue as his 23-year-old daughter, 
Lisa, told jurors her father told her he had compiled a list of people he 
wanted to kill, including her and the two women her father allegedly gunned 
down in July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley faces life in prison without parole if convicted of killing his 
sister-in-law Joyce Stanley, 52, and Terry Vasquez, 41, as the three worked 
together in a Fountain Valley embroidery shop. Stanley admits killing the 
women, but contends he was suffering a form of amnesia at the time and was 
unaware of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The stress of the testimony in Orange County Superior Court was evident. The 
daughter's eyes were rimmed in red and her voice quavered as she recalled a 
confrontation during which her father ticked off the names on the list, which 
included her name and those of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what she understood the list to mean, the young woman answered 
quietly: "That he wanted to end their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The father and daughter are estranged. The prosecution contends Stanley killed 
the women in part because he blamed his sister-in-law for his troubled 
relationship with his daughter. Joyce Stanley and her husband, Charles -- the 
defendant's brother -- sought guardianship of the daughter because the 
defendant moved frequently to find work. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant has been described as a "survivalist" who collected guns and 
often threatened to kill those who angered him. His threats were so frequent 
that few took him seriously. After the July 8 killings, he fled to Colorado, 
sparking a nationwide manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
 He was captured July 11 after a law enforcement officer became suspicious and 
began questioning him. Stanley was arrested when a gun slipped out of a pant 
leg while he was talking to the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Denise Gragg said during opening statements Tuesday 
that her client was suffering from amnesia triggered by stress and severe heart 
problems when he "went off" and killed the women. Gragg said her client did not 
premeditate the killings, a factor needed to help prove first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Molko told jurors Stanley bragged to a friend 
that he planned to commit the murders and withdrew money from the bank shortly 
before the killings, apparently to help fund his getaway.

BLUFF PROPOSAL GETS WARM RESPONSE FROM OFFICIALS; PROJECT: SAN CLEMENTE COUNCIL 
MAY BEGIN TALKS WITH DEVELOPERS ON PLANS FOR SHOPS, RESTAURANTS AND 
CONDOMINIUMS ABOVE PIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A $15.6-million plan to build restaurants, stores and condominiums on the 
oceanfront bluffs overlooking the pier received an enthusiastic reception 
Wednesday from the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members debated whether to open negotiations with two developers, 
Continental Commercial Corp. and Riverside Commercial Investors Inc., who 
presented the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they've done a darn good job," Mayor Scott Diehl said. "At this point 
. . . we're in a position where it's time to move forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The most important element of the plan, according to the staff, is the 
proposal to renovate the historic Casa Romantica, a home built by the city's 
founder, Ole Hanson, and convert it to a restaurant. A portion of the 
8,000-square-foot estate would become a museum recalling the history of San 
Clemente. About $130,000 would be spent on the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight we reach a milestone in the long-term goal to restore the Casa 
Romantica," said Jim Holloway, community development director. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans also call for 53 time-share condominiums, two restaurants and retail 
shops and a funicular -- a cabled tram that would shuttle visitors to the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners say the proposal by two developers is far smaller than the one 
made in 1990 by the Ratkovich Co. A storm of protest from residents caused 
those plans to be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've learned our lessons," said Jim Pechous, assistant city planner. "We've 
learned to sharply define the project before the developer is brought in." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Ratkovich plan failed, several public meetings have been held to 
help create the latest plan. Pechous said the proposal before the City Council 
on Wednesday conforms to those guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had not voted by late Wednesday night on whether to begin 
negotiations.  
</P>
<P>
 But city officials acknowledged that there will be opposition to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some who won't like this project no matter what is proposed," City 
Manager Michael W. Parness said. "It's an emotional issue for many people." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the current plan believe it is inappropriate to turn a historic 
city landmark into a restaurant. And they fear the museum might be muscled out 
to create more profit-making dining areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should just leave the Casa Romantica alone," said activist Karolyn 
Koester, the former mayor. "It's a people's project -- not a developer's 
project, not the city's project."

 A grenade exploded during a training exercise Wednesday, injuring seven 
Marines, two seriously, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the Marines were treated at the scene for cuts to their arms, legs, 
hands and faces caused by grenade fragments. The other two were taken to the 
Naval Hospital, where they were in serious condition, said 1st Lt. David 
Steele. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of all seven Marines were being withheld pending notification of 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion occurred about 3 p.m. at the northern end of the base as 
grenades were being removed from an MK-19 grenade dispensing machine gun. 
Steele said it was unclear whether the Marines thought the gun was empty. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident is under investigation.

 Doug Gottlieb, a point guard at Tustin High, made an oral commitment to attend 
Notre Dame, he announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb, a 6-foot, 180-pound senior, was a Times all-county selection and the 
Sea View League boys' basketball most valuable player last season after 
averaging 19.7 points and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved the campus at Notre Dame," Gottlieb said. "I like the idea of going 
to play in the Big East as a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame, which plays as an independent, will join the Big East for 
basketball in the 1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb, who also has a 3.6 grade-point average, visited Notre Dame Sept. 
9-11 and told Coach John MacLeod of his intention to sign with the Fighting 
Irish Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb canceled trips to Connecticut, Florida, Michigan State and Virginia. 
He also considered UCLA and Stanford. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: SCC NO PATSY AGAINST AZTECS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California College men's soccer Coach Dave McLeish usually schedules 
several games a season against NCAA Division I programs. The games serve as 
recruiting aids for future players and confidence builders for the current 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, they serve to add to the Vanguards' loss column. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday, SCC defeated San Diego State, 1-0, when Kevin Villar scored on a 
penalty kick with 10 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the biggest victory since I've been at SCC," McLeish said. "We 
have beaten other Division I schools but not a soccer power like San Diego 
State." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State outshot SCC, 20-4, but McLeish said his team wasn't dominated. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first half we had a lot of the play," McLeish said. "In the second 
half we had a flurry of brilliant saves by our goalkeeper." 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Brent Rogers had eight saves, including a point-blank shot from 
about 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior midfielder Nguyen Tran set up the winning goal when he took a pass, 
beat the player guarding him and then beat they only player standing between 
him and the goalkeeper. The second player pulled Tran down from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC, which is 3-4 after losing to another Division I team, UC Santa Barbara, 
4-0, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 McLeish says this team has the potential to be the best in his eight seasons 
at the college, although play has been spotty so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they play up to their abilities they're really good," he said. "It's 
just a matter of them coming together." 
</P>
<P>
 Villar, a junior midfielder from Tustin High and Orange Coast, Peter 
Schumerth, a sophomore sweeper from Esperanza, and Jason Allen, a junior 
fullback who transferred from San Diego State two years ago, have been 
standouts so far. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC's schedule won't get much easier when the Vanguards start their Golden 
State Athletic Conference schedule Oct. 1. Westmont, ranked third in the nation 
in NAIA, lost to UCLA in double overtime and No. 16 Azusa Pacific recently tied 
Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter what happens the rest of the way, the Vanguards still had their 
day in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyway you look at it, when a NAIA school with 900 kids beats a big Division 
I school, it's a great day," McLeish said. "We really enjoyed the ride home." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Unranked: UC Riverside, ranked No. 18 in NCAA Division II women's volleyball, 
ended Southern California College's seven-match winning streak, winning 15-6, 
15-12, 15-11 Tuesday. Last week, the Vanguards won their first two Golden State 
Athletic Conference matches, defeating Concordia and Point Loma Nazarene, then 
ranked No. 9 in the NAIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards (11-2, 2-0) are the only undefeated team in conference play. 
Yet, they still haven't received mention in the national poll. Six other 
conference teams -- No. 4 Westmont, No. 5 Cal Baptist, No. 12 Azusa Pacific, 
No. 15 Fresno Pacific, No. 21 Biola and No. 25 Point Loma Nazarene -- are 
nationally ranked. Concordia received votes in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I do find it curious that we're leading the toughest conference in 
the country and not receiving any votes whatsoever," SCC Coach Eric Boyles 
said. "It's frustrating in the sense that I really feel like these girls have 
been working hard and their level of play has gotten better and they haven't 
been given their due respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Simone Burgesmeir, a senior outside hitter from Johannesburg, South Africa, 
was named the conference player of the week. She had 36 kills, 32 digs and a 
service percentage of .958 in three matches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After starting the season with a 1-0 loss to Cal Baptist, the Chapman men's 
soccer team is building up steam. The Panthers' last two games have gone to 
overtime, a 3-3 tie with Claremont and a 5-4 victory over Cal Lutheran. Chapman 
is 3-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, Chapman will travel to Colorado for games Saturday against Regis 
and Sunday against Colorado College. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado College is coached by Horst Richardson, who coached Chapman Coach 
Gregg Murphy in club soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman water polo team started its season by winning three of its first 
four games and finishing third in the Whittier tournament. The Panthers lost to 
Occidental, 8-6, in the semifinals and beat Loyola Marymount, 22-13, in the 
third-place game. . . . Southern California College recently announced the 
college's spring 1994 scholar athletes. They are: Tedla Mekonnen 
(cross-country), Jennifer Caruso (softball), Rick Homutoff (baseball), Wendy 
Andel (tennis), Cathy Binnquist (tennis), Ross Andel (tennis), Joel Kuipers 
(basketball), Wes Hinson (track and field), Content Lyke (basketball), Christi 
Hosman (basketball), Jason Allen (soccer), Shannon Moreno (softball), Tina 
Demarsh (basketball), Genevie Wright (volleyball), Tracy Schofield (softball), 
Cheri Mills-Bowling (cross-country) and Andrea Oleson (soccer). . . . Ryan 
Seidel, a current SCC baseball player, and Jason Brissey, a former player, each 
had outstanding summers. Before being signed by the Cubs and assigned to their 
Class-A team in Peoria, Brissey, a third baseman, batted .377 with 10 runs 
batted in for the Swift Current Indians in the Saskatchewan League. Seidel, a 
senior outfielder, also played for the Indians and led the league in five 
categories: batting average (.471), hits (48), home runs (seven), RBIs (31) and 
steals (10). He was named the league's most valuable player.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: MURCHISON ENDURES THE VOLLEYBALL 
PROGRAM'S GROWING PAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody told Mary Ellen Murchison it was going to be easy when she took over as 
head coach of the Titan women's volleyball program in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And it certainly hasn't been. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived on a wave of controversy: the university's attempt to drop the 
program, the reinstatement of it after a sexual discrimination suit filed by 
the team and Coach Jim Huffman's firing that eventually embarrassed the 
university. A jury awarded Huffman $1.35 million in his wrongful termination 
suit against the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The road has been rocky since. In Murchison's first two seasons as head coach 
since arriving from Santa Clara, the Titans won only twice, once each season, 
and this year's team is 0-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult when a school doesn't have a history of winning," 
Murchison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton has had only one winning season since the university began 
competition in the sport in 1976. That came in 1981 when the Titans were 18-17, 
but they still struggled in the Big West Conference with a 2-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Murchison, however, hasn't lost hope. She feels the program is making 
progress, even though it hasn't shown up in the won-loss column. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's a matter of time, and our players learning that they can win," 
Murchison said. "We had an 8-0 lead in a game against New Mexico State last 
weekend and couldn't sustain it. That's a matter of confidence, and as soon as 
we get over that, we'll see more victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look back on our first nine games, I can see ways where we could 
easily have been 6-3. We match up with several of those teams we've played. 
When I came here, I said it was going to take a five-year program, and I still 
believe that. We knew it wasn't going to happen overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Murchison said she has been pleased with the effort being made. "It's not that 
the players don't have the work ethic or the desire," he said. "But winning is 
the validation of their hard work, and they need that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Murchison thinks the present team has some promising young athletes, but still 
needs more of them. She has been especially pleased with the play of Stephanie 
Cargill, a freshman from Fresno. Murchison had some anxious moments when 
Cargill suffered a knee injury last weekend, but it wasn't as serious as first 
thought and will not require surgery. However, she probably will be sidelined 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cargill is the type of player who can take us to the next level," Murchison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murchison remains hopeful that she can make more inroads in recruiting some of 
the top high school players from Orange County. "The high school players here 
are some of the best in the nation, but we haven't been able to recruit as well 
in the county as we would like," she said. "We're sitting in a real hotbed of 
volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
 But even a good team can be overshadowed by some of the national powers that 
play on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Big West has four of the top teams in the nation in Long Beach State, 
Hawaii, UC Santa Barbara and Pacific," Murchison said. "Then, when you add 
Stanford and UCLA, there are six of the top teams in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 That level of competition makes Murchison's rebuilding effort that much more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team right now would definitely be winning if we were back East," 
Murchison said. "But a drawing card for our players is that they're able to 
play against the best on the West Coast. It just makes it that much more 
difficult to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we're competitive now with those non-California teams, but most of 
them have had postseason experience and they come in with winning records. It's 
a matter of getting over the hump with some victories." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season, Murchison thought a goal of 10 victories would have been 
realistic. "Obviously, that's going to be more difficult now," she said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Titan soccer Coach Al Mistri was pleased with the 3-1 victories over New 
Hampshire and Vermont by his men's team in the Reebok Invitational last weekend 
in Burlington, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like we're getting better each week, but in soccer the margin 
between winning and losing is very thin," Mistri said. "Those definitely were 
two of the better teams in the East. A lot of our young players have been 
playing under a lot of pressure, but they've done well." 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Soto had two goals in each game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans didn't come through the weekend unscathed. Ricky Rodriguez suffered 
a deep knee bruise, and Adrian Cortes and Peter Lak had ankle problems. All 
three may be at less than full strength for today's game against San Diego 
State at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans are ranked 13th nationally this week by Soccer America. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton President Milton Gordon has been elected the Big West 
Conference representative to the NCAA Presidents Commission. He was selected by 
other conference presidents and will have a four-year term in that 
position...The Titan women's soccer team plays at home Friday against Oregon 
State. Amber Dickey and Jennifer Patterson lead the team in scoring, each with 
two goals. . . . Coach John Elders thinks he will get a better reading on the 
strength of his cross-country team in Saturday's meet at UC Santa Barbara 
against the host school and Westmont College.

 With backup right tackle Darryl Ashmore out with a sprained medial collateral 
knee ligament, rookie Wayne Gandy will back up both left tackle Clarence Jones 
and right tackle Jackie Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy, a first-round draft pick who has struggled in the first three games, 
got most of his work in practice at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a swing tackle at Auburn so I'm not foreign to the position," said 
Gandy, whom the Rams took 16th overall in last April's draft. "We're pretty 
thin right now, so everybody's having to chip in and learn all the positions. 
Coach says he's going to get me out there, hopefully." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the Rams re-signed wide receiver Todd Kinchen and put left guard 
Keith Loneker (fallen left arch) on the injured-reserve list. The Rams also 
worked out offensive lineman Roosevelt Patterson, a free-agent from Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 William White, the Chiefs' starting free safety, suffered a sprained ankle and 
is questionable for Sunday's game. . . . Kansas City quarterback Joe Montana is 
12-7 as a San Francisco starter against the Rams, and the Chiefs are 7-0 at 
Arrowhead Stadium with Montana as their starter. . . . The Rams lead the 
series, 3-1, and are 2-0 at Arrowhead Stadium. MIKE REILLEY and T.J. SIMERS

UNIFORM RULE UNRAVELS AT SANTA CLARITA SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somewhere out there, somone -- and you know who you are -- is sporting the 
bottom halves of the school uniforms that were supposed to have adorned the La 
Mesa Junior High School student body. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been nearly a month now since the black, white and teal uniforms 
were hijacked from their delivery truck -- and that's only one of the reasons 
the Santa Clarita school has been forced to put its new mandatory uniform 
policy on indefinite hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, announced two weeks into the school year, was greeted with 
disappointment from parents -- and naked glee by most of their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great, because (the uniforms) are stupid," said seventh-grader Nick 
Dunkle, 13, who attended school Wednesday in a decidedly less official ensemble 
-- an Orlando Magic T-shirt and olive green shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the adults were less pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say morale has dropped, enthusiasm for the program has dropped 
because of the delay," said La Mesa Principal Rochelle Neal, one of the main 
proponents of the uniform program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected some initial hurdles, but I did not expect this kind of delay." 
</P>
<P>
 La Mesa was supposed to begin the year as the first and only school in the 
William S. Hart Union High School District to have a mandatory uniform program. 
</P>
<P>
 But a series of snafus -- ranging from the hijacking to computer and other 
problems -- has delayed delivery from the vendor, Sunland-based Cherokee, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Singer, president of Cherokee's uniform division, said the robbery 
occurred Aug. 29 when three men hijacked a truck containing about 9,000 
uniforms for various schools, including La Mesa, as it was leaving a sewing 
factory in Montebello. The hijackers forced the driver to lie on the floor of 
the truck and blindfolded him, releasing him in Long Beach after taking his 
money and the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truck's been recovered, but none of the uniforms were recovered," Singer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other problems have plagued the uniform company, including 
processing breakdowns that caused further delivery delays. Singer also 
acknowledged that the firm is considering restructuring under Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection, but he added that any decision on that was weeks away 
and would not affect uniform deliveries to La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of these problems, only a handful of the 500 students enrolled at 
the new school have received their uniforms -- which have been already paid 
for. Some others have gotten just a shirt, skirt, pair of slacks or some other 
part of an outfit. The cost of the uniforms -- which include several sets of 
clothes -- is about $100 to $150 a year per student. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said the company has been supplying institutions with uniforms since 
the early 1980s, but that this is its first year in the school uniform 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten off to a rocky start with this uniform thing," Singer said, "but 
I believe ultimately kids will have their uniforms and parents will be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will be attending a meeting of La Mesa's parent advisory committee 
tonight to explain his company's position. 
</P>
<P>
 But although Singer expects Cherokee to have worked out its shipping problems 
and have the uniforms delivered to La Mesa next week, district officials and 
parents were skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt they should have managed it better," Sukhinder Rana said. "We paid the 
money, and they told us the uniforms were ready. I've been calling (Cherokee) 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the number of uniformed students at La Mesa has dwindled steadily. 
Even on the first day of school, only about a third of the students wore the 
prescribed attire. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, only a handful of students were wearing them -- mostly because 
ther parents made them.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; FRESHMEN RUSH FOR CSUN FRATS AND SORORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Kimberly Smith sat holding a torn-open white envelope, she couldn't help 
but smile about the contents within. This was no ordinary invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Printed on the tiny piece of paper was Smith's acceptance to the Delta Delta 
Delta sorority, her first choice among six on the Cal State Northridge campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I didn't want to join," admitted the freshman. "But I thought about 
how I really don't talk to my friends from high school anymore and thought this 
would be a good way to meet people." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was one of more than two dozen young women picked for the sorority's 
fall pledge group who participated in rush week at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush week is the official introduction to Greek life. Sororities and 
fraternities hold elaborate parties and other activities over a five-day period 
to attract hundreds of prospective members. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who take part start the week by attending an open forum, where they get 
an idea of what the Greek system has to offer. This year, they heard pitches 
from the six sororities as well as twice as many fraternities. Several parties 
were held at each Greek house so members could get a feel for the group they 
wanted to join. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every (sorority) house is different," said Frances Villalobos, a member of 
Alpha Omicron Pi. "During rush, we try to draw in members of all ethnicities 
and personalities and show them how much our sorority has to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 While it may look like an excuse to party, these Greeks take rush week 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members say that "going Greek" provides a constant in a student's life 
and builds long-lasting friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Chan of Sigma Alpha Epsilon believes a fraternity is more than just a 
"social corporation." It prepares members for the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a valuable learning process unequal to that of a classroom," he said. 
"You have to experience it to believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the social side of the Greek campus life that lured freshman Kris 
Pincheira to Pi Kappa Phi. "Chicks and brewskies" will be easy to find at the 
many parties the fraternity will hold this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Future social events on the Greek agenda include homecoming, formals, 
fraternity and sorority mixers and chapter celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not just a social thing," said Igor Shalkevick, president of Zeta 
Beta Tau. "It's a way to integrate all types of people." ALICIA DOYLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; CLASS ON EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS OFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Scott Brewer was jolted awake by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, he 
knew it was time to practice what he had been teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction was that this is actually happening; this was no drill," 
said Brewer, who instructs a disaster preparedness class sponsored by the city 
of Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earth stopped shaking, Brewer checked to make sure his wife, Susan, 
who had been sleeping beside him, was all right, he said. Then, they both put 
on heavy shoes to avoid cutting their feet on broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
 They checked the house for broken windows or structural damage that could 
cause injury, he said. After that, they checked for gas leaks, then ventured 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 They discovered that much of the home's Spanish tile roof had been shaken 
loose and was piled in a heap outside their door, Brewer said. That's a lesson, 
he added, on why you should never run outside during earthquakes, as some 
suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had run outside," he said, "we would have been at the bottom of all 
that tile." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer's reaction to the quake serves as a real-life example of some of the 
survival techniques included in his free six-week course. The first session of 
a new set of classes begins tonight at 7 p.m. at Agoura Hills High School. 
Non-residents are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer, director of the Agoura Hills Disaster Response Team, said the course 
is designed to save lives. "Anyone who has done these things to prepare, that 
is one less potential victim that we have to rescue," said Brewer, who has been 
teaching the course since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Robertson of Agoura Hills says he wishes he and his fiancee had taken the 
course before the Northridge earthquake -- instead of after. "We found out 
after the quake that we were out of power for three days. And we got a dose of 
reality: that we had to be depending upon ourselves, and that we were not 
properly prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's session, Brewer said, covers basic earthquake preparedness. "This 
teaches people what to do before, during, and after, at home, in their car, at 
school, or out in public." 
</P>
<P>
 The second and third sessions cover first aid, including how to deal with 
people who have been traumatized by disaster, he said. The fourth session, 
covering hazardous materials safety, is taught by the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department's Hazardous Materials unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth session covers urban search and rescue techniques, which include 
rescuing people trapped in their homes, Brewer said. It stresses using caution 
in deciding whether to try to rescue someone. The final course is on fire 
safety and suppression. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; CONCERT HALL GETS OK TO SERVE ALCOHOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite loud cries of opposition from neighbors, a city zoning official has 
granted the Country Club concert hall in Reseda permission to serve alcohol -- 
providing it meets a long list of strict conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid a repeat of past problems at the club, Albert Landini, an associate 
city zoning administrator, said that he tied 60 conditions to the approval, 
many of which address safety and security of neighbors as well as patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't surprise me to see this (decision) appealed," Landini said, 
noting that opposition to the conditional use permit had been strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Country Club owner Tony Longval -- with the support of the Los Angeles Police 
Department, Councilwoman Laura Chick's office and the local Chamber of Commerce 
-- sought the permit earlier this summer.  
</P>
<P>
 He was running a clean business that featured low-key blues and country 
performers as well as boxing matches, he said, and promised alcohol would not 
cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Longval pointed out at an Aug. 1 hearing before the zoning administrator that 
the club had been granted temporary permits and served alcohol on numerous 
occasions, all without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business owners and residents near the venue at 18415 Sherman Way agreed, 
but also said they feared a permanent permit would lead to problems that 
occurred under previous owners: concert-goers urinating in yards, fighting in 
the streets and drinking in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Landini ordered that as many as 17 security guards -- both armed and unarmed 
-- be on and around the premises during events. He also banned hard rock, heavy 
metal and punk concerts, and limited everything from operating hours to 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Longval said Tuesday he was happy with the decision, having already agreed to 
comply with the conditions, most of which were formulated during meetings with 
the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, which is not currently operating, must still receive a permit from 
the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Department, Longval said. ERIC SLATER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY OPENS NEW TENNIS, POOL FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This fall, two familiar words may be echoing down the canyons of Calabasas 
more than before: "Tennis, anyone?" 
</P>
<P>
 After years of disrepair, a former private club was dedicated Wednesday as the 
new Edmund D. Edelman Tennis and Swim Center, at 23400 Park Sorrento. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility, now owned by the city of Calabasas, caught the attention of 
county Supervisor Edelman in 1991, when Edelman learned that the property's 
owners hoped to replace the facility with a condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Edelman worked with city officials to secure funding to purchase and 
rehabilitate the center for public use. He obtained $1.5 million from a 
settlement with the developers of the nearby Baldwin development project, plus 
an additional $672,000 in state park and recreation funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility boasts 14 tennis courts and an Olympic-size swimming pool. 
Grass and clay courts are under consideration for the future. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; WEST VALLEY PARENTS FEAR LOSS OF TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents of students at Calahan Street Elementary School in Northridge and 
other neighboring schools met with district officials Tuesday night to discuss 
their concerns about the possibility that teachers could be transferred from 
West Valley schools because of low enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, the Los Angeles Unified School District takes a count of how many 
students are enrolled at each school on what is called "Norm Day," which is 
four weeks after the first day of school.  
</P>
<P>
 If a school's enrollment is considerably down, the district transfers teachers 
to more crowded schools or places them in a substitute teacher rotation. When 
this happens, a school must reorganize its classes more than four weeks into 
the semester. 
</P>
<P>
 West schools face a unique situation this year because enrollment at many 
campuses is down by 60 to 80 students so far, meaning the schools could each 
lose one or two instructors, according to Calahan PTA representative Mandy 
Ritzmann. 
</P>
<P>
 The low enrollment may be a result of families having moved away from 
dwellings that were destroyed in the January quake, Ritzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents at the meeting expressed concerns that the families who have left may 
return in a few months, and if teachers have been transferred, the schools may 
wind up being overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's too early for schools to completely panic," said Joyce Peyton, 
who oversees school space issues for the district. "It's the first week of 
school -- no one gets their full enrollment. We estimated enrollment would be 
down. It shouldn't surprise anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Ritzmann cited a new study conducted through the district's mental health 
department that shows many children are experiencing post-traumatic stress 
since the earthquake and that further disruption in their educational life will 
hinder the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Julie Korenstein told parents she would try to have "Norm 
Day" pushed back from Oct. 14, its current date, and that she would also see if 
the federal government could help fund the salaries of the teachers that 
otherwise would be transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Moore, a district official who oversees some West Valley schools, has 
compiled enrollment numbers. He said he is now comparing last year's rosters to 
this year's and examining students' addresses to see if they lived at 
properties known to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said he expects to have a better idea of how significantly the 
earthquake figures into the low enrollment by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein added that the numbers may also have been affected by the 
district's new open enrollment policy that allows parents to send their child 
to any school in the district where space is available. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: 16-VEHICLE PILEUP INJURES 1, JAMS TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A chain-reaction, 16-vehicle pileup caused one minor injury and a long traffic 
tie-up on the westbound Ventura Freeway on Wednesday morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem started about 5:20 a.m. when a motorist made an unsafe lane change 
on the freeway's downhill grade near Las Virgenes Road, and five cars hit each 
other, said California Highway Patrol Officer Dave King. 
</P>
<P>
 As other motorists tried to avoid that wreck, they caused six other accidents 
as cars rear-ended each other in the fog, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only reported injury occurred when one of the drivers, who was not wearing 
a seat belt, hit her head against her windshield, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 That motorist was not hospitalized, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two lanes of traffic were blocked for more than an hour as authorities cleared 
up the accident, King said. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CURATOR GIVES WHALE'S TALE A NEW TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call him Ishmael.  
</P>
<P>
 John Heyning, the Natural History Museum's marine mammals curator, regularly 
"hunts" whales. Most of them, however, are already dead -- Heyning tracks down 
beached animals and then carts the giant creatures back to the museum for study 
and model casting, garnering some strange looks along the way from other 
freeway motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's task had a twist.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trucking a real creature through Los Angeles, Heyning transported a 
16-foot, 250-pound fiberglass model of a young female killer whale from the 
main county museum in Los Angeles to its satellite facility in Burbank.  
</P>
<P>
 And instead of a journey on the freeway, where the high speed could have 
dislodged the model from its wooden pedestal/frame, this trip was on surface 
streets, through residential neighborhoods and back roads, Elysian Park and 
downtown Burbank.  
</P>
<P>
 That Heyning and another museum worker had trouble finding their way to and 
through Griffith Park only meant more puzzled glances from folks unaccustomed 
to seeing a killer whale riding along their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the freeway, people come racing by because we're going slowly in the right 
lane, then they realize they saw something unusual and drift back," Heyning 
said as he took a wrong turn and to the amazement of passersby, headed into the 
hills above Dodger Stadium. "But I bet this is the first time a killer whale 
has been in this neighborhood."  
</P>
<P>
 Once settled into its new home, the unnamed teen-age orca with traditional 
black and white markings will star in a traveling exhibit called "Masters of 
the Ocean Realm: Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises." The display opens Oct. 1 and 
runs through Jan. 8 before beginning a six-year tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But first the model had to get to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 After carefully mounting it on a foam-covered wooden frame, securing the frame 
to the bed of the truck and the orca to the frame, Heyning and exhibit designer 
Cyrena Nouzille were off. Unlike the protagonist in "Moby Dick," Heyning 
travels not by the ship Pequod, but by a flatbed truck that is outfitted with 
extra thick tires for beach traveling and a tilting bed and winch for loading 
whales. All those extras, however, do not make for easy three-point turns when 
one gets lost, as the two-person crew soon discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Whalemobile lumbered on its circuitous route over the hills and into 
the San Fernando Valley, the response varied depending on the part of town 
through which the behemoth rode. 
</P>
<P>
 Late morning traffic along Figueroa Street through the heart of Downtown was 
downright blase. 
</P>
<P>
 One wrong turn near Dodger Stadium, however, sent the Whalemobile on small, 
condominium-lined streets. Residents might have smelled it before it came into 
sight: Although the whale was fake, the truck carried the very real dead animal 
bouquet of Whalemobile trips gone by. 
</P>
<P>
 "Real whales navigate better than this," said Heyning, a Torrance native who 
earned his Ph.D. in marine biology from UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 The few folks out for a jog or sitting on porches just stared, silently, at 
the lost cetacean. 
</P>
<P>
 Once into Burbank, past amazed golfers and the city sanitation worker who 
drove by shouting "Free Willy!" it was the children who took the most delight 
in the whale ferry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because they're so popular, we're using it as a hook to teach about science," 
Heyning said. "We are using it to say research is fun." ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; ANTI-PROSTITUTION PROGRAM UNDER WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys woman has been sentenced to four months in jail for violating a 
mapping program that bans convicted prostitutes from plying their trade in 
certain areas of the San Fernando Valley during nighttime hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence, the most severe handed down so far for violating the 4-month-old 
law's provisions, was imposed Friday on Lillian Romero, 46, for entering the 
vehicle of a male motorist within a restricted area. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn's mapping program, defendants 
convicted of prostitution in San Fernando Valley courts are given maps on which 
the restricted areas are marked. They are prohibited from engaging motorists in 
conversation, soliciting or accepting rides, or being parked in a vehicle with 
any motorist in those areas between 5 p.m. and 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers, armed with a list of names and photographs of people who have 
been given the maps, monitor potential violators in hopes of arresting them 
before they conduct their business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than sit and wait to attempt to catch them engaging in an illegal sex 
act, officers can jump right in and get these people off the streets without 
spending so much time," said Deputy City Atty. Laura Van Eyk, who handles 
mapping violation cases in Hahn's Van Nuys office. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, "this program is more cost-effective than trying to get an undercover 
officer in the area and have him be solicited," Van Eyk said. "Streetwise 
prostitutes often recognize an officer working undercover and will not attempt 
a solicitation." 
</P>
<P>
 The mapping program, initiated in Hollywood in April, 1993, was formulated in 
response to growing street crime and other problems in certain areas attributed 
in part to prostitution, according to Van Eyk. 
</P>
<P>
 Restricted areas in the Valley run along Sherman Way and Sepulveda, 
Lankershim, Ventura and Reseda boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the program is still in its initial stages, no statistics are 
available indicating its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Word will travel quickly among prostitutes that this is serious business, 
that the police know who they are and are looking out for them," Van Eyk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, other than that, it's hard to tell what the true impact is going to be," 
she said. "The first prostitute we arrested (under the Valley program) had a 
Hollywood map on her, which tells me that they may be just leaving these 
areas." ANTONIO OLIVO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PANEL CALLS FOR TEAM TO FIGHT HATE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Glendale City Council is being urged to form a hate crimes response team 
that would rush to the aid of people who are attacked because of their race, 
religion, age, gender or sexual orientation, and would publicly denounce such 
crimes when they occur. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Ribbon Task Force on Community Relations, a 14-member panel whose 
members mirror the city's diverse ethnic and social mix, will formally present 
the council next Tuesday with a resolution that, if adopted, would establish an 
official policy for dealing with hate crimes in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that we have a proactive stance," said Alice Petrossian, 
director of intercultural education for the Glendale Unified School District 
and a task force member. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime in general is unacceptable, but we need to make everyone in this city 
aware that crimes based on someone's gender, age or ethnic or language 
background will not be tolerated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said 58 hate crimes have been reported in Glendale since the 
Police Department started keeping statistics on them 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the task force was formed by Mayor Eileen Givens just this year, after 
several hate crimes were reported in the city -- most notably the May 
spray-painting of anti-Armenian slogans at the headquarters of Homenetmen 
Ararat, an Armenian youth scouting organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution condemns crimes committed against people because of their race, 
creed, color, national original, religious beliefs or sexual orientation. It 
also sets out a plan of action for the city to take in the event of a hate 
crime: 
</P>
<P>
 * When a hate crime is reported, the city -- via a hate crimes response team 
to be formed through the Police Department or other officials -- would contact 
the victim and help provide any needed assistance such as counseling, graffiti 
cleanup, repair of damaged property and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city would issue a press release describing the incident and condemning 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * The response team would determine what actions could be taken to prevent the 
incident from being repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Carole Meyers of Temple Sinai said the resolution will establish "a 
long-needed plan for the established, recognized leaders of Glendale to deal 
with hate crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time (the Homenetmen incident) happened, there was no plan for how our 
city would respond to this," Meyers said. "We have to speak out and say, 'This 
is not what Glendale stands for; we welcome these people in our community.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said the task force will continue to meet, and will now focus its 
efforts on promoting ethnic tolerance. STEVE RYFLE

SOKA LOSES ONE ROUND WITH CONSERVANCY; COURTS: SCHOOL WANTED TO INCLUDE MORE 
PLAINTIFFS IN THE LAWSUIT THAT IS ATTEMPTING TO CONDEMN PART OF ITS PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The protracted legal battle between the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and 
Soka University over its scenic Calabasas campus continued Wednesday with the 
school losing a bid to draw even more players into the already complicated 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The school wanted a judge to add the conservancy -- as well as the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors and two Ventura County parks agencies -- as parties 
to a lawsuit filed by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, 
which is attempting to condemn part of Soka's property. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not unusual for litigants to try to add defendants to civil suits. In 
this case, Soka wanted the judge to add the conservancy and Ventura agencies as 
plaintiffs, arguing they are partly behind the condemnation process launched by 
the MRCA. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a move that even Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Barnet Cooperman 
characterized as "an issue of some subtlety," but one that nonetheless would 
have seriously hampered the MRCA's efforts to seize Soka's campus for parkland 
by driving up court costs and turning even routine hearings into scheduling 
nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 The MRCA wants part of Soka's campus for a park visitors center; Soka wants to 
expand its small language school into a liberal arts college. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka's request to Cooperman addressed the way in which the MRCA operates and 
how the condemnation process was launched in 1992. The MRCA is operated under 
an agreement between the conservancy and two Ventura County parks agencies, and 
is overseen by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka lawyer Hodge Dolle said his intent was to draw out of their "mystical 
cloaks" the governmental and park agencies he claims have been hiding behind 
the "alter-ego" of the MRCA, which is an arm of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolle hinted that officials from the conservancy, which is a state agency that 
acquires parkland, intentionally used the conservation authority to condemn 
Soka so they could circumvent state law and shield the conservancy from any 
negative fallout from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like Dr. Frankenstein saying I'm not liable for the big guy's 
trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert McMurry, attorney for the conservation authority, said the failed 
move was little more than an attempt to bleed the agency financially by 
dragging legal proceedings on indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurry conceded that the conservancy has tremendous interest in whether 
Soka's property is condemned, and will file friend-of-the-court briefs in the 
case. But, he added, the conservancy is legally distinct from the conservation 
authority and should be treated so. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Cooperman refused Soka's request, saying the school would gain no 
legal advantage by including the agencies in the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the case has spent 20 months in various courtrooms around California 
-- and the formal condemnation trial has not even begun.

CITY COUNCIL FACTIONS COMPROMISE ON QUAKE FUNDS FOR SENIORS; RECOVERY: 
AGREEMENT ENDS FOR NOW A DISPUTE BETWEEN VALLEY AND SOUTH L.A. LAWMAKERS OVER 
HOW TO DISBURSE DISASTER MONEY -- EQUALLY OR BASED ON SEVERITY OF DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday approved a last-minute compromise to 
distribute quake funding for senior citizens, narrowly averting a turf battle 
that had been brewing between lawmakers from the San Fernando Valley and those 
from South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents Hollywood and surrounding 
areas, still blasted her colleagues for two recent instances of divisive 
arguments over earthquake funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm increasingly disturbed by the notion that there has to be a 'we' and 
'they' in our disaster recovery plan," she said. "I think that shows a real 
failure of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 A clash over allocation of $2.2 million in federal grants had loomed ever 
since last week when three Valley council members, acting as the council's Ad 
Hoc Committee on Earthquake Recovery, recommended increasing funding for Valley 
seniors and slashing funds for South Los Angeles communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The move angered South Los Angeles lawmakers, who said seniors in those 
communities need help recovering from the quake even though their neighborhoods 
did not suffer the heaviest damage. 
</P>
<P>
 On the recommendation of Councilman Joel Wachs, the council voted 11 to 1 for 
a compromise plan that boosts the funding for both the Valley and South Los 
Angeles with surplus dollars intended for use during the second year of the 
grant program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really hopeful that this will balance the recognition that the Valley 
has great needs and the recognition that there are seniors in need throughout 
the city," said Wachs, who represents parts of the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, grants will be used to help relocate seniors from damaged 
homes, fund repairs and provide legal assistance and transportation, among 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's compromise was good news for Evelyn Knight, the executive 
director of the People-Coordinated Multipurpose Senior Center in the Crenshaw 
district. Under the compromise motion, her center gets $140,000 instead of the 
$75,000 that was proposed by the earthquake recovery panel. 
</P>
<P>
 She said some of the money will pay staff to help senior citizens apply for 
federal and state emergency assistance. "We have a lot of people who are frail 
and unable to get through the various bureaucracies," she said after the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a full-blown turf war was avoided at Wednesday's council meeting, 
some bickering broke out, making it the second time in so many months that 
Valley and South Los Angeles council members have clashed over quake funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, whose Northridge-based district was hit hardest in the 
quake, cast the sole dissenting vote, arguing that the money should be 
distributed based on severity of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Producing a chart that lists the amount of quake damage in each council 
district, Bernson argued that the compromise plan gives South Los Angeles areas 
more money than they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not trying to play one end of the city against the other end of the 
city as Mr. Wachs has portrayed," he said. "We are trying to address dollars to 
where the damage took place." 
</P>
<P>
 The previous squabble over quake funding was ignited last month when 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents parts of South Los Angeles, led a 
move to cut the Valley's share of $47 million in housing funds. Instead, he 
recommended, funding should be increased for low-income housing citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas angered Valley lawmakers when he engineered the switch while 
three Valley council members were absent. At a subsequent meeting, and in the 
presence of the Valley members, the council reversed itself and restored the 
full Valley allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest controversy over senior grants began when a committee led by 
Councilwoman Rita Walters approved an allocation plan that set aside about a 
quarter of the $2.2 million for four senior services centers in South and 
South-Central Los Angeles. Walters represents parts of downtown and 
South-Central Los Angeles. The rest of the funding was earmarked for the 
Valley, under Walters plan. 
</P>
<P>
 When the proposal was forwarded to the earthquake recovery committee, Valley 
Council members Bernson, Richard Alarcon and Laura Chick voted to increase by 
more than $100,000 the funding to Valley senior services agencies and slash 
nearly $200,000 from senior centers in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs' compromise restored the cuts proposed for South Los Angeles and kept 
intact the increases suggested for the Valley. The additional money was drawn 
from $1.8 million in unallocated dollars set aside for the program's second 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the compromise said it is fair because it disburses the money 
more evenly and they lauded it for derailing a major funding feud. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Hernandez, who represents part of East Los Angeles, said 
seniors in his district have not received their fair share of city services for 
more than 20 years and should get a portion of the funding even though quake 
damage was not extensive there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still looking forward to the day when every Angeleno is treated the 
same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas said that he supported the compromise for now.

$5 MILLION OKD TO EXPAND SANTA MONICAS; PARKS: HOUSE-SENATE PANEL'S 
APPROPRIATION FOR THE RECREATION AREA TOPS THE 1994 TOTAL BY $1 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A House and Senate conference committee Wednesday approved $5 million to 
expand national park holdings in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area during the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The appropriation is $1 million above the 1994 total and as much as park 
supporters dared hope for. Conferees, who had to harmonize a House 
appropriation of $5 million with a Senate allotment of $2 million, approved the 
higher figure rather than split the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman at national recreation area headquarters in Agoura applauded the 
decision, as did Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), sponsor of the 
1978 bill that established the mountain park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very gratified that we were able to convince other members of Congress 
to put a priority on protecting natural resources in the Santa Monicas," 
Beilenson said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Administered by the National Park Service, the recreation area covers 150,000 
acres from the western edge of Griffith Park in Los Angeles to Point Mugu State 
Park in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 A mosaic of private lands and public holdings, it includes several large state 
parks and beaches, and about 21,000 acres of National Park Service properties. 
Plans call for the agency ultimately to acquire 35,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's appropriation still must be approved by the full House and Senate, 
but that is considered a formality. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an increase over last year, the $5 million is well below the level of 
some years past. From fiscal 1989 through 1993, for example, the Santa Monicas 
park never got less than $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the $5 million is 10% of the $50 million approved for expansion of 
all national parks and monuments, according to an aide to the House interior 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Saguaro National Monument in Arizona got more -- $6 million -- than the 
Santa Monicas park, the aide said. Everglades National Park also received $5 
million.

ROGAN, SCHIFF CLASH REPEATEDLY OVER POLICIES; DEBATE: ASSEMBLY CANDIDATES SPLIT 
OVER PROPOSITION 187, AND LATER ON GUN CONTROL AND ABORTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale) backed a November ballot measure to 
deny public services to illegal immigrants and urged the teaching of 
creationism in schools Wednesday night, and his Democratic opponent for the 
Assembly seat accused Rogan of allying himself with a "radical right agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, first elected in May to fill a vacant Assembly seat, and former federal 
prosecutor Adam Schiff, the Democratic candidate, clashed repeatedly over 
policy differences, including an unexpected spat over affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
 The two split immediately over Proposition 187, the ballot measure to deny 
health, welfare and education services to illegal immigrants that has become 
the hottest item on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff said he agreed with the proposition's goals but said it was not the 
most effective way to curb illegal immigration. It would be better to beef up 
the Border Patrol and more effectively track foreign visitors who overstay 
their visas, Schiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 While agreeing such steps were important, Rogan said Proposition 187 was 
essential to a complete attack on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan challenged Schiff to join him in an effort to dismantle the state's 
affirmative action laws. Schiff said he shared Rogan's concerns on racial 
preference rules when they become hard and fast quotas, but he refused to 
categorically denounce such programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In their most bitter clash, Schiff accused Rogan of being an uncompromising 
foe of gun control and of a woman's right to abortion while saying the 
assemblyman has received financial support from the Allied Business PAC of 
Orange County, which he called s "radical right" group. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much of their agenda do you share?" Schiff asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan countered that Schiff's real complaint with him and the Allied PAC is 
the PAC's commitment to fundamental Christian values. Rogan agreed that he 
believes creationism should be taught alongside evolution in public schools as 
the origin of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should be taught both sides," Rogan aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman also questioned Schiff's efforts to paint himself as a 
moderate Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that if he is elected, Schiff's first vote would be to pick a speaker 
of the state Assembly, Rogan asked whether Schiff would vote for Assemblyman 
Jim Brulte, the Assembly GOP minority leader, or longtime Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to vote for anyone who wants to make abortion a crime," said 
Schiff, referring to Brulte's views, but he refused to say whether he would 
vote for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's debate was the first time the two men have clashed face to face 
since Rogan, a former Municipal Court judge in Glendale, was elected four 
months ago in a special election to fill the seat that GOP incumbent Pat Nolan 
was forced to leave after pleading guilty to a political corruption charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In that May special election, Rogan got 54% of the vote in a field of seven 
candidates while Schiff finished second with 26%. Rogan's strong showing 
surprised most political observers who expected him to finish first but not 
with a majority of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Nolan has proved to be a reliable vote for traditionally 
conservative causes. For instance, he voted against a measure -- opposed by the 
National Rifle Assn. -- to widen a state ban on assault-style weapons, he 
supported a proposal to permit the paddling of juveniles convicted of graffiti 
vandalism, and he joined a small group of GOP fiscal conservatives who opposed 
Gov. Pete Wilson's 1994 budget bill because it contained a $7-billion deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats have long been only a feeble presence in the 43rd Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 But a reapportionment plan implemented two years ago that pulled parts of 
Hollywood into the 43rd District, the Nolan scandal and the 1992 election -- in 
which the Bill Clinton-led Democratic ticket scored well even in Glendale -- 
have raised the hopes of Democratic strategists that their long sojourn in the 
political wilderness may be over. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, voter registration numbers favor the GOP. Republicans account for 41% 
of the electorate, Democrats 45%. Because GOP party members generally are more 
likely to vote, the district is still viewed as Republican-leaning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats are hopeful Schiff's record as a highly honored federal 
prosecutor and his claims that he will seek bipartisan solutions to the state's 
problems will stand him in good stead with moderate Republicans concerned about 
crime but who might be turned off by Rogan's positions on abortion and gun 
control.

INMATE SUES SHERIFF'S DEPT. FOR INJURY IN RACIAL BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prisoner is suing the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, alleging his 
civil rights were violated when he was injured in a racially based brawl at the 
Pitchess jail in Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryce Kelly contends in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior 
Court that sheriff's deputies failed to adequately supervise a "racially 
charged" atmosphere at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho on the afternoon of 
Sept. 21, 1993. As a result, a riot erupted during which Kelly suffered a cut 
to his left hand that nearly severed four fingers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Sheriff's Department said he had not seen the lawsuit and 
could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The jail has been the site of numerous racially based fights, commonly between 
Latinos and African Americans. As of May 9, sheriff's deputies had reported at 
least 52 fights at the jail this year, some involving as few as two prisoners 
and some as many as 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during a melee between African American and Latino inmates that Kelly, 
who described himself as belonging to both groups, was injured, said George T. 
Kelly, an attorney who represents Bryce Kelly, but is not related to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, which also alleges medical negligence and names County-USC 
Medical Center as a co-defendant, further contends that despite recommendations 
by medical personnel at the hospital that surgery be performed immediately on 
Kelly's hand, six days passed before he was treated. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Kelly's fingers suffered permanent damage and now curl into his 
hand, the suit said. He has lost about half the movement in the fingers, his 
attorney said. A decision by the Sheriff's Department to send Kelly to 
County-USC for medical treatment, as opposed to a nearby hospital in Newhall, 
was also based on race, the lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, who is serving the remainder of his sentence at a different jail, is 
seeking compensatory and punitive damages and attorney's fees.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have sought unsuccessfully for a way to prevent racially based 
melees at Pitchess such as the one Kelly says he was injured in. 
</P>
<P>
 So explosive were tensions at the jail earlier this year, that the American 
Civil Liberties Union, historically a staunch opponent of racial segregation, 
said in January that separating prisoners by race may be the only way to defuse 
tensions.

NEIGHBORS FILE SUIT TO BLOCK NORTHRIDGE DAY-CARE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neighbors of a planned day-care center in Northridge have sued to prevent the 
facility from opening, saying the center would violate deed restrictions 
imposed on the residential community nearly 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court by 33 Northridge 
residents, asks a judge to stop Fernando and Sherry Segre from opening the 
center in the 18000 block of Devonshire Street. The suit also asks for at least 
$25,000 in damages for each neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council approved establishment of the day-care center in 
June after a lengthy, heated dispute among neighbors and council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, including Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents Northridge, said 
the center would turn the neighborhood into a commercial zone. But supporters 
said the day-care center, which would care for a maximum of 24 children, would 
fit into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Donaldson, who lives two doors away from the Segres, said he joined the 
lawsuit because he fears the day-care center will create a traffic problem on 
Devonshire Street as well as diminish his property values. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Fernando Segre and his attorney said they had not seen the 
lawsuit but planned to fight it vigorously. The center is scheduled to open in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have no grounds to stand on," said Segre, referring to the plaintiffs. 
"We went through all the legal processes and we won." 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for the plaintiffs was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contends that in 1956 the owner of what was then called Devonshire 
Village imposed restrictions on each of at least 34 lots to keep them uniform 
and "to make the land a desirable neighborhood." The lawsuit says the 
restrictions allow only residential and agricultural uses and a day-care center 
would violate those conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contends the center will cause "discomfort, annoyance and 
inconvenience" to neighbors and reduce their property values.

DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST BUCKLEY SCHOOL; HARASSMENT: MAINTENANCE 
WORKER SAYS HE WAS FIRED FROM THE EXCLUSIVE INSTITUTION BECAUSE OF HIS AGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Contending he was harassed, discriminated against and ultimately fired because 
of his age, a 57-year-old maintenance worker filed a discrimination lawsuit 
Wednesday against the exclusive Buckley School. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Glasgow said he was persecuted from "day one" by a younger, less 
experienced supervisor because of his age, and then -- despite 20 years of 
maintenance experience and having received verbal and written commendations for 
his work -- fired in September, 1993, 10 months after he was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the school, the suit names as defendants the supervisor, 
Timothy Ekeberg, as well as headmaster Walter Baumhoff and business 
administrator Carmen Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was assumed that because of his age, he was not capable of meeting his 
standards," said Glasgow's attorney, Maria Hanna Joseph of Los Angeles. "We're 
seeking . . . in excess of $1 million or $2 million." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges a pattern of harassment 
and "intentional interference with the appearance of the quality of (Glasgow's) 
job performance" by Ekeberg, who was described as about 37. 
</P>
<P>
 A receptionist at the private school -- known for educating many movie stars' 
children and having entertainment celebrities on its board of directors -- said 
Wednesday that officials were aware of a possible suit, but headmaster Baumhoff 
said he knew nothing of the case and could not comment. Ekeberg could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasgow was summarily fired after Ekeberg contended that a potentially 
dangerous wire was discovered dangling from a light fixture, the suit says. 
Glasgow contends he inspected the light but performed no maintenance on it, as 
there appeared to be nothing wrong except for a burned-out light bulb. He 
instructed a janitor to change the bulb, he said, and left for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned one hour later, "he was handed his walking papers," Joseph 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges his firing may have been orchestrated in advance by Ekeberg, 
who, it claims, regularly made disparaging remarks about other older employees 
and older relatives of students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The substantial paperwork and necessary approval of plaintiff's termination 
seems to have been completed in just one hour. . . . Such diligence suggests 
that Ekeberg and Buckley (School) operate in a remarkably efficient manner in 
terminating employees," the suit reads. "The alternative deduction is that 
plaintiff's termination had been pre-planned." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was all done on a lunch hour," said Joseph, who specializes in 
discrimination cases.

NEAR FULL RECOVERY FOR QUAKE-DAMAGED ST. JOHN'S; HEALTH CARE: REPAIR PROJECT 
WILL ALLOW HOSPITAL, MINUS ONE WING, TO REOPEN INPATIENT SERVICES OCT. 3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Nine months ago, the Northridge earthquake put an end to inpatient services at 
St. John's Hospital and Health Center, leaving walls ripped apart and sending 
eerie, X-shaped cracks up and down the facility's exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hundred patients were evacuated. About 1,750 jobs were lost. And the 
Santa Monica hospital was plunged into self-examination: How to re-create the 
hospital in the face of the massive changes under way in the health-care 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is still out on exactly how the St. John's of the future will look. 
But the facility, long considered one of the leading hospitals in Los Angeles 
County, has largely recovered from its physical wounds. With $32 million in 
repairs completed, St. John's will open in two weeks -- minus its north wing -- 
for inpatient services. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a high level of excitement and spirit in getting back to work and 
seeing patients here again," said Bruce Lamoureux, chief operating officer for 
the hospital. "It is all at once overwhelming and very, very exciting. We have 
learned tremendous things." 
</P>
<P>
 The opening is scheduled for Oct. 3 at 5 a.m. But the hospital plans to herald 
the event with a picnic and parade Saturday and a ribbon-cutting ceremony, with 
Gov. Pete Wilson in attendance, on Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 What the temblor did in half a minute has taken hordes of laborers 256 days to 
mend. The hospital's main and south wings, both badly damaged in the quake, 
were reinforced, from the foundation to the top floor, with 14-by-18-inch 
vertical steel columns and horizontal beams. The steel braces added roughly 2 
1/2 feet of width to the buildings' exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 The main wing's foundation had to be excavated and replaced. The east and west 
wings of the hospital, only cosmetically damaged, have had their cracks filled 
and repainted. But the most severely damaged building, the north wing, has been 
demolished, leaving only a dirt lot with chalked concentric circles marking the 
spot of the former rose garden. The empty space, at least temporarily, will be 
used for modular buildings that will replace the north wing's lost auditorium, 
which had been used for community education and conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Terry Muldoon, St. John's director of engineering and 
construction, the buildings are structurally stronger than they were before the 
earthquake because of the cross-directional steel frames. 
</P>
<P>
 But within five years, the buildings must begin retrofitting to comply with 
seismic hospital safety codes or be replaced, Muldoon said. State hospital 
building officials required medical buildings with more than 10% in lateral and 
vertical damages to fully comply with current state codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that such upgrading would be overwhelming, officials allowed 
hospital administrators to develop a long-term plan to bring the facility into 
compliance with hospital building codes. In the interim, buildings were brought 
up to the codes that were in place the year that the structures were erected. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the main wing had to be repaired to meet at least the 1936 codes, and 
the south wing has been restored to at least 1968 codes, said Shell Culp, 
spokeswoman for the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. The 
east and west wings were built in 1974. The north wing was constructed in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 A strategic planning committee is at work on a master plan for the long-term 
seismic improvements and is scheduled to release a report in January, Muldoon 
said. A cost estimate has not yet been made, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As they promised, hospital administrators hired back many of their former 
employees. About 90% of the 1,000 positions -- have been filled by former St. 
John's employees, with their seniority maintained and at the same rate of pay, 
according to Gary Miereanu, hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Inpatient beds were reduced from 501 to about 260. Most of the 1,200 
physicians who had privileges at the hospital have maintained them. Only the 
neonatal intensive care unit, which was housed in the hospital's north wing, 
has not been replaced. Hospital administrators have said they have not decided 
whether the unit will be re-established. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nurses and other employees returning to St. John's, the past two weeks 
of orientation have been a little like a family reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is hugging everybody, and that first hour was really like seeing 
your family after a year," said Mary Tomassini, a 34-year employee. "We really 
care about each other and we really care about the hospital. It's so good to be 
home."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST VALENCIA MARKETPLACE; 
DEVELOPMENT: CITIZEN GROUPS OBJECT TO THE SIZE AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE 
PLANNED SHOPPING CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three local citizen groups have slapped the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors with a lawsuit for approving construction of an 830,000-square-foot 
shopping center west of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia Marketplace, if built, would be the largest shopping center in 
the Santa Clarita Valley. As developed by the Brentwood-based 
Riley/Pearlman/Mitchell Co., it would include large discount stores, retail 
shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors approved the project July 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday alleges the board 
failed to adhere to the county's Development Monitoring System, which is 
supposed to ensure that roads, schools, law enforcement and other public 
services keep up with new construction in high-growth areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mitchell, vice president of Riley/Pearlman/Mitchell, said he was "very 
disappointed" to be served by the suit, especially after having more than 40 
meetings with various community groups during the planning of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working for three years with the community," Mitchell said. 
"Anyone who had concerns, we would meet with." 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, the legal action would invalidate the project's environmental 
impact report and suspend board approvals. The Newhall Land and Farming Co., 
which owns the property, and Riley/Pearlman/Mitchell are named as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Those behind the lawsuit represent environmental interests, small businesses 
and private citizens living near the property proposed for the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the project is going to support the infrastructure, the 
sheriff's services," said Lynne Plambeck, vice president of the Santa Clarita 
Organization for Planning the Environment, one of the groups that filed the 
suit. "We would like to see the project downsized." 
</P>
<P>
 The environmentalists are specifically concerned about the center's removal of 
105 oak trees and the project's impact on the hillsides and a creek on the 
property, Plambeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also disputes estimates that the Valencia Marketplace will generate 
$3 million for Los Angeles County in sales tax and property tax revenues. The 
groups say county officials haven't considered the loss of tax revenue and jobs 
by existing small businesses when the shopping center opens. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never figured the loss from other businesses," said Plambeck. "They 
never figured the job loss or the loss of the tax base." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining SCOPE as co-plaintiffs are the Lyons Avenue Merchants Assn., 
representing businesses that fear competition from the center's large discount 
stores, and Stevenson Ranch Residents for Responsible Development, which 
includes citizens living near the project site concerned about noise, traffic 
and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd have known when I bought my house that this was planned, I never would 
have moved here," said Andrew Peruzzi, a Stevenson Ranch resident. "I moved 
here to get away from that." 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the center, larger than the existing Valencia Town Center, would 
make it an eyesore, Peruzzi said. The citizens group is pushing for a 
one-fourth reduction in size. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying don't put this in. We're saying put something in with some 
integrity," Peruzzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley/Pearlman/Mitchell officials have not extensively reviewed the lawsuit, 
but say their project already addresses the bulk of the issues that have been 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction improvements to Old Road and other nearby intersections will 
improve traffic conditions, and the installation of a land mass to deflect 
noise will also help absorb sounds generated by traffic rumbling along the 
Golden State Freeway, Mitchell said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BRINKS POSTS REWARD IN GUARD'S SLAYING 
</P>

<P>
 Brinks Inc. is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of a man wanted in the Sept. 6 slaying of an employee who 
lived in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennie Plese, who worked as an armed guard for Brinks, was shot in the back of 
the head at close range as he delivered bags of money to Manufacturers Bank in 
Beverly Hills.Police say the gunman ambushed Plese about 8:40 a.m. before the 
bank opened. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman escaped with an undisclosed sum. Plese, 61, died in the lobby of 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are checking several leads that have been telephoned to a hot 
line: (310) 288-2650. 
</P>
<P>
 A sketch of the gunman has been circulated. He is described as being in his 
early to mid-30s, about 5 feet, 10 inches tall, with black hair and mustache 
and a long, narrow face. He has a medium build and was wearing a dress shirt, 
tie and dark pants at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Plese was a 36-year veteran of the Brinks company. He spent most of his career 
as a messenger, in charge of walking the money from the armored car into 
financial institutions, Brinks officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the third Brinks employee killed on duty since 1976 in the Greater Los 
Angeles area, Deiro said. SUSAN STEINBERGSECURITY GUAR

DEAL TO BRING CEBALLOS TO LAKERS NEARLY DONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers and Phoenix Suns have agreed on a trade to bring Cedric Ceballos to 
Los Angeles for a first-round pick and could make it official as soon as today 
if Ceballos signs a restructured contract as expected and passes his physical. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos and agent Fred Slaughter met with Jerry West, the Lakers' executive 
vice president, for about 90 minutes Wednesday to discuss a slightly altered 
contract, which would be necessary because of salary-cap constraints. While no 
deal was struck, Slaughter said his client has agreed to forgo $350,000 of the 
$2.1 million he was to earn in 1994-95 to fit into the available slot of $1.75 
million and that all that remained was to resolve how Ceballos would be 
reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the factors are in place that I think it's going to happen," Slaughter 
said. "The hardest part is getting it to work with the salary cap. . . . I 
think Jerry West and I will be able to do something and that Cedric Ceballos 
will be in a Laker uniform now that his days with the Suns have ended." 
</P>
<P>
 Said West: "We're optimistic that we will complete the deal (today)." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Suns are expected to contend for an NBA title, they welcome the 
opportunity to add what could be a high first-round pick within the next few 
seasons while also cutting the $9 million Ceballos has coming over the next 
four seasons, especially with a huge payout earmarked for Danny Manning next 
summer. Getting the pick in exchange for someone who would have been a backup 
had he stayed in Phoenix makes the deal all the more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal has obvious appeal for the Lakers too. They will be adding someone 
who is only 25, is a good rebounder for a small forward, scores and shoots with 
accuracy, all shortcomings during the 33-49 showing of 1993-94. And, it is 
expected, they will do it with a clause in the deal that says the Lakers can 
retain the pick if it is too high in the lottery. In fact, that protection is 
in place for the next two seasons, meaning the Suns may not get the choice 
until the 1997 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact wording of that part of the agreement makes the deal even less risky 
for the Lakers. They apparently not only have standards on what pick Phoenix 
can have, but also the option on when the Suns will take it. That means the 
Lakers may, for example, forfeit the choice for '95 even if it is within the 
protection because that draft is expected to be weak and then keep the future 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think we can get a player better than this with the pick," West 
said. "We think he's a terrific talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos -- from Dominguez High in Compton, Ventura College and Cal State 
Fullerton -- had two unspectacular seasons with the Suns after being drafted 
late in the second round in 1990. He started to blossom in 1992-93, when he led 
the league in shooting percentage and, as a restricted free agent that summer, 
was rewarded with a five-year contract that started at $2 million and peaked at 
$2.4 million with annual $100,000 raises. 
</P>
<P>
 By last season, he had become a major factor in the offense despite sitting 
out the first 29 games because of a second stress fracture of the left foot and 
then being the fourth option at times behind Charles Barkley, Kevin Johnson and 
Dan Majerle. He averaged 19.1 points and 6.5 rebounds in only 30.2 minutes 
while shooting 53.5%, only to become expendable when Manning arrived as a free 
agent.

DAVIS RETURNS QUIETLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He had left without warning. He tried to return without controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed, watching Raider defensive end Scott Davis back playing Wednesday 
at the team's El Segundo training headquarters, it was as if he had never left. 
</P>
<P>
 There he was as always at the morning walk-through, going through the daily 
routine in shorts and a cut-off shirt. There he was in the afternoon in full 
uniform, running up and down the field in a sweat-soaked uniform. There he was 
talking with linebacker Greg Biekert, the man he fought with on Sept. 6, the 
day he had left camp. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the only time Davis seemed tense was when he had to face reporters 
and explain his two-week absence. 
</P>
<P>
 He was cordial, but he was not about to reveal more than he had to. 
</P>
<P>
 He would say only he had been gone because of "some very private, personal 
issues that demanded my attention. I did what I felt was best. I took care of 
them. It took me a couple of weeks to do and, with the cooperation of the team, 
I'm back here." He said he was glad to be back and didn't plan to leave again. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis insisted that his fist-swinging brawl with Biekert had nothing to do 
with his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the NFL," he said. "There's incidents that happen every day. . . . 
It's not a sensitivity encounter group. You've got big guys out there going at 
it. That's OK. You're all brothers. You get up, brush yourself off and you take 
care of it. That issue had nothing to do with what I had to do outside of 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 Biekert, who suffered a deep gash on his nose during the fight, also wasn't 
harboring any grudges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no problem with Scott and he has no problem with me," Biekert said. 
"It's back to work. I'm glad to see him back." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third time Davis, 29, has unexpectedly left football, but the 
first time he has done so during a season. He left the University of Illinois 
for a year because he was suffering from burnout, and retired from the Raiders 
after the 1991 season for two years to go into private business. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he said, there was no timetable on his return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just took it one day at a time, and I'm obviously back here because I want 
to be back here," he said. "We're all grown-ups, and you've got to take care of 
what's important." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' absence has been explained over the last two weeks as being caused by 
personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Problems might be a strong term," Davis said. "I think they're just issues I 
had to deal with. First and foremost is your family. . . . You've got to take 
care of your family, so that's what I did. . . . I feel comfortable with the 
way it was handled." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis kept in touch with both Raider management and his teammates during the 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to create any dissension," he said. "(That) was my major 
concern. I just wanted to check with those guys and they made it clear that 
they were OK with what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis spent the summer working himself back into football shape, finally 
cracking the starting lineup for the season opener the day before he left. He 
did not practice with the first unit Wednesday and isn't guaranteed his 
starting spot for Sunday's game against the San Diego Chargers at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 How far back has his absence set him? 
</P>
<P>
 "Two weeks," defensive line coach Gunther Cunningham said. "He needs to 
practice. He needs to hit the sleds, the bags and people. He'll be all right. 
(Even before this), if he'd been ready by the end of the first third of the 
season, I'd have been happy." 
</P>
<P>
 However long it takes for Davis to get ready, he says he has pulled his last 
disappearing act. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken care of," he said. "This sort of incident won't happen for the 
rest of the season. It took its toll and people were affected by it."

U.S. DAVIS CUP TEAM LOOKS FOR REDEMPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Redemption is near but not yet in the grasp of the U.S. Davis Cup team, whose 
fortunes took a nose dive after it won the coveted silver cup for the 30th time 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of the team is revenge. Abandoned by its top players, who found 
their schedules packed with exhibitions and other more lucrative undertakings, 
the United States campaigned in 1993 with a diluted squad. 
</P>
<P>
 The only American players willing to make the long trip to Australia proved to 
be game but not exactly successful. A humiliating first-round loss to Australia 
meant the defending Davis Cup champions lost the right to compete for the Cup 
until this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a relegation-round victory over the Bahamas a year ago preserved the 
United States' place in the World Group, where it has clawed its way to 
Gothenburg to face Sweden in the semifinals, which begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the U.S. team is led by the world's No. 1 player, Pete Sampras. 
Joining Sampras in singles is No. 6 Todd Martin. The doubles team is Jared 
Palmer and Jonathan Stark. All players have reported to work in good condition 
and say they are ready to take the steps to reclaim the Cup. Anything to erase 
the memory of last year's loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "That certainly made my recruiting job a lot easier," captain Tom Gullikson 
said, watching Sweden's singles players, Stefan Edberg and Magnus Larsson, 
practice on the indoor carpet of the Scandinavium Arena on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Davis Cup format spans three days; two singles matches on the first, a 
doubles match on the second and two singles on the third. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other semifinal this weekend, Russia plays at Germany. Should both 
favorites emerge, the Germans would play host to the Americans for the title 
during the first week in December. 
</P>
<P>
 After last year's match in Australia, it has been a long road back for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something the guys were a little embarrassed about," Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gorman was the captain for that disaster, where his top players were Brad 
Gilbert and David Wheaton. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the philosophical underpinning to Gullikson's captaincy. Waving 
the flag is often a hollow exercise as a means to motivate athletes who spend 
their lives in pitched competition against each other. Gullikson has found that 
with this group of players he need only wave the sport's history book. A player 
such as Sampras is growing ever mindful of his place in tennis history and 
knows that Davis Cup competition is a key component. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players all recognize what the most important events are," Gullikson 
said. "Certainly the best players are going to be remembered for how many Grand 
Slam titles they won and maybe how many times they helped their country to win 
a Davis Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 The road to the semifinal has been long. The trip began in earnest after the 
5-0 victory over the Bahamas in Charlotte, N.C., a match that Gullikson said no 
one took lightly because had the United States lost again , the team would have 
been exiled to zonal qualifying with the other tennis has-been nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wanted to be the guy who sent the U.S. into zones; we wanted a big win 
to make a statement," Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Gullikson faced perhaps the toughest test of his tenure -- 
persuading luxury-loving professional tennis players to go to New Delhi to play 
India in March. Absent was Andre Agassi, who had been suspended after refusing 
to play the meaningless final singles match after the United States had already 
clinched the victory over the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martin went, as did Jim Courier, and the team came away with another 5-0 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullikson prepared for the quarterfinal match against the Netherlands in 
Rotterdam by pondering his possible selections. For singles he chose Courier, 
who had been struggling, and Sampras, who had not. Both players won on the 
first day for a 2-0 lead. Then the Americans unraveled. The doubles team lost 
on the second day and on the final day Richard Krajicek upset Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 That left everything to Courier against Jacco Eltingh. Courier won, 6-3, 6-4, 
4-6, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings the team to this port city in western Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are only thinking of doing what we have to do to win," Gullikson said, 
leaving the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 He paused, adding, "We really want to get our reputation back."

RODGERS PASSES BUCK TO BAVASI; ANGELS: FOUR MONTHS AFTER HIS FIRING, HE BLAMES 
GENERAL MANAGER, NOT BROWN, FOR DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Buck Rodgers strolled to the bar after the round of golf, dug into his pocket 
and abruptly waved off the visitor pulling out his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, I got it," he said. "Hey, I might be out of work, but I'm still 
getting paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers laughed, a growling roar. He took a swig of beer, peered over his 
glass and delighted in the response. 
</P>
<P>
 Few men who ever wore an Angel uniform have been more popular than Rodgers. He 
was an original Angel. He survived the horrifying 1992 bus crash. He believed 
he'd be an Angel for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the owner was happy with me," Rodgers said. "I thought the general 
manager was happy with me. I thought everything was going just like we planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how stupid I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers was fired as manager May 17 with his team only two games out of first 
place. Never was he more surprised in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 It took one month for Rodgers to realize what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 It took two months for him to be convinced that General Manager Bill Bavasi, 
and not President Richard Brown, fired him. 
</P>
<P>
 It took four months to publicly talk about the firing, revealing his feelings 
for the first time since his May 18 news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful Gene Autry gave me the chance to manage the California Angels, 
but I didn't realize the California Angels were as screwed up as they were," 
Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much ignorance, lack of communication, and intimidation going on 
there, it's a shame. Everybody is scared. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to want people who know what they're doing. You can't be 
intimidated by everybody that second-guesses you. If you know what you're 
doing, you shouldn't care less about second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way you can be intimidated is by lack of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "And believe me, we were intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
 Could that change? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not until the club is sold," Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel owner Jackie Autry has put the club on the market for $130 million, 
although only a minority share will be sold while Gene Autry is living. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too late for Rodgers. His dream of becoming the first manager to lead the 
Angels to the World Series, and then moving into the front office, has been 
ruined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, I'd really like to be a general manager," said Rodgers, who has 
received several exploratory calls from other clubs. "I always thought it was 
something I'd like to do when I got burned out on the field, but that hasn't 
happened yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't ready to leave managing." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Bavasi made the decision for Rodgers, replacing him with Marcel 
Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never more surprised in my life," Rodgers said. "I thought I had been a 
pretty good soldier. I thought I was doing a pretty good job of boosting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a long time for me to realize just what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers initially blamed Brown for the situation. He ridiculed Brown at his 
news conference, saying Bavasi merely was following orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Rodgers acknowledges he was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've since learned it was just another case of a young general manager being 
intimidated by a veteran manager," Rodgers said. "The guy is young, and he's 
not that knowledgeable of the game, and I think I intimidated him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bavasi is a paper man. He's bright and organized, but that's all you can say 
about those type of guys. It's unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that still bothers me about Rich Brown is that he had always 
told me, 'You're my man. You're my guy. You'll always be with us.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he turns around and takes the word of a 34-year-old guy (actually 36), 
who's been a general manager for a month and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was double-crossed." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi actually contemplated firing Rodgers as early as late March. It became 
obvious to Bavasi that it was not going to work between them, but he waited as 
long as he could before asking to make a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown: "Billy made every attempt for it to work with Buck, and when it 
was time to make a decision, he did it. I was going to stand behind him in 
whatever decision he made." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers was summoned to his office the morning of May 17 and was fired. He was 
not given any reasons for the firing, but then, he never asked for any, either. 
</P>
<P>
 He would have been told that the team lacked fundamentals. He would have been 
told that he needed to be on the field working with the players instead of 
entertaining reporters. He would have been told that he was too openly 
opinionated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't have mattered because what you see is what you get," Rodgers 
said. "I'm not a phony. I wasn't going to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say I'm too honest. Well, if you start (snowing) people, your 
ballplayers are going to see right through it. It catches up to you." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting between Rodgers and Bavasi lasted fewer than 10 minutes. When it 
ended, Bavasi held a news conference at Anaheim Stadium. Rodgers waited until 
the next day and then told reporters he did not wish to be bothered. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers went into seclusion for nearly a month. He wanted nothing to do with 
baseball. He spent time at his beach house, still trying to contemplate what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt he had gotten the team and players to the point to win the division," 
said Judi Rodgers, Buck's wife of 36 years. "That's what was so hard about it. 
That was his team, and he believed in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing caught him by surprise more than this. It was a total shock. It 
knocked our socks off." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers eventually took a part-time scouting job from his close friend Lee 
Thomas, general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies. It would at least keep 
him occupied. Rodgers would scout major league teams in the area, although he 
refused to set foot inside Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of respect for Marcel Lachemann, and I didn't want to make 
things tough for him," Rodgers said. "It wouldn't have been fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I shut up for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as I agreed or disagreed with things that went on with the 
organization, I did not want Marcel Lachemann looking over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back, I thought we could have won it, but it's all hypothetical now. 
Nobody got a chance to find out what they could do. The strike took care of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, who will continue to earn his $600,000 annual salary through the 1995 
season, believes that baseball will survive this tumultuous time. The fans will 
come back, he says. The owners and players eventually will become partners. 
</P>
<P>
 And who knows, maybe that's when he will also return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pro-player, but you have to look at the economic climate," Rodgers said. 
"This is the first time the players will have to give something up, and that's 
hard for them to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't be considered a weakness. I think (Players Assn. chief Donald) 
Fehr can give in without weakening the union. Really, I think he has no 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Rodgers will wait, hoping that the right opportunity comes 
along. There are two managerial vacancies, with four other possible openings 
before Christmas. Who knows, maybe one day he can be reunited with Whitey 
Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Whitey got a bad reputation," Rodgers said. "He kick-started this 
farm system. OK, maybe there were a few signings he wishes he could take back, 
but he did a pretty good job around here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to hear some of the things I hear because most of those people 
couldn't hold Whitey Herzog's jockstrap. He did a good job, and there was no 
doubt in my mind we were going to turn this thing around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I'm afraid the organization is back to square one."

DOES MADDOX HAVE FUTURE WITH RAMS?; PRO FOOTBALL: QUARTERBACK FIGURES TO BE 
ATTRACTIVE TO EXPANSION TEAMS NEXT SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Running the Rams' scout squad during practice, Tommy Maddox has assumed the 
roles of some of the league's top quarterbacks -- Atlanta's Jeff George, San 
Francisco's Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
 But when will Maddox stop impersonating and become a starting NFL quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready," said Maddox, a former UCLA standout whom the Rams got by trading 
a fourth-round draft pick to Denver last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox, inactive for the Rams' first three games, is getting a chance to show 
what he can do this week, practicing with the second string for the first time 
because starter Chris Miller is out with rib and shoulder injuries. Chris 
Chandler will start Sunday at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rams' front office might have jeopardized Maddox's future with the 
team when it restructured his contract earlier this week, a strong indication 
that he isn't the team's quarterback of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 To save money under the league's $34.6-million salary cap, the Rams cut 
Maddox's salary by $300,000 in exchange for voiding the final year of his 
four-year, $4.4-million deal they had assumed from the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 It allows Maddox, a third-year player, to become a restricted free agent at 
season's end. That's a major risk considering expansion franchises in Charlotte 
and Jacksonville probably would be willing to pay big salaries for a talented 
young quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 By keeping Maddox, 23, in the final year of his contract, the Rams would have 
had another year to see if he could play without the risk of losing him to a 
team that can outbid them during the free-agency period. 
</P>
<P>
 If Maddox does sign elsewhere, the Rams would receive as compensation first- 
and third-round draft picks, depending on their contract tendered to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But can the Rams afford to match if another team makes a high-priced offer? 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a restricted free agent, Tommy's rights will still belong to us," Coach 
Chuck Knox said. "We're looking for him to come in and be ready to play for us. 
We think he has a really big future." 
</P>
<P>
 If that's the case, why would the Rams risk losing him?  
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends on when the coaching staff decides if Maddox is the 
quarterback of the future," said Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president. "Will 
that be eight weeks? Twelve weeks? They're looking at him." 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox said the team hasn't indicated what his future role is, nor is he 
certain of his playing time should Miller be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just sit around your whole career," said Maddox, who started only 
four games the last two seasons in Denver, where he backed John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating to stand on the sidelines and know you're not even going to 
get in the game unless some bizarre things have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm to the point now where everything I can improve on is on the field. I 
don't think I can stand on the sideline and learn anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Maddox has grown impatient running the Rams' scout squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I redshirted my first year in college, and sometimes this season has kind of 
been like that," Maddox said. "I'm trying not to look at it like that, but it's 
frustrating. Any time quarterbacks are playing on your team and you aren't, 
you're going to get frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams took advantage of Denver's eagerness to trade Maddox, whom the 
Broncos had drafted in the first round in 1992 and billed as the heir apparent 
to Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos said they were having salary-cap problems and wanted to cut 
Maddox's $875,000 salary by $600,000. Maddox took that as an insult, and the 
team shopped him around the league. 
</P>
<P>
 But Denver insiders say the salary cap wasn't the only consideration that led 
to Maddox's departure. His mental toughness and work ethic were questioned, and 
he didn't get along with Bronco offensive coordinator Jim Fassel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rams figured Maddox's value will increase in the off-season. Plus, 
Maddox gave them the young quarterback they had bypassed in the first round of 
the draft when they didn't take Fresno State's Trent Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Tommy has the capability to be a starter in this league," said Dave 
Logan, a former wide receiver with Cleveland and Denver who now does radio 
commentary for the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look around the league and see those expansion teams coming in, and you 
have to figure he's going to be a starter somewhere next year." 
</P>
<P>
 But will he ever start for the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not my call," Maddox said. "All I can do is work hard and stay in 
meetings and look at film and get myself prepared mentally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't sit around and drive myself crazy with this."

KINGS WIN; SOLIDARITY COMES FIRST; HOCKEY: PLAYERS TRADE RARE HANDSHAKES WITH 
RANGERS BEFORE 1-0 VICTORY IN SYMBOLIC MOVE BEFORE POSSIBLE LOCKOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone is used to seeing teams go through the traditional handshake ritual 
once a playoff series is completed. But before an exhibition game? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the Kings and New York Rangers shook hands before the puck was dropped 
Wednesday night at the Forum and before the Kings went on to win, 1-0, with 
goaltender Kelly Hrudey stopping 33 shots before an announced crowd of 11,436. 
You might think the Rangers, winners of the Stanley Cup in June, are simply 
used to being gracious, accepting handshakes all around. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was a pre-planned move of union solidarity. It also happened 
before the Montreal-Toronto and New Jersey-Philadelphia games. Facing the 
possibility of a lockout, perhaps as early as next week, the players are paying 
attention to the little details as well as the major ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could just be this one game or it could be other games as well," said 
Maple Leaf forward Mike Gartner, president of the NHL Players Assn. "It was a 
small signal of solidarity." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings have been creative in other ways. King defenseman and union 
representative Rob Blake and defenseman Marty McSorley informed team officials 
that the players would not participate in next week's Media Day at the Forum, a 
traditional preseason function. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be cooperative, but we can' say we're going to continue with a 
smile on our face," McSorley said. "There's a time and a place to draw the 
line. We have to somehow let the owners know we're not happy." 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the potentially distracting talk of the lockout threat and on-going 
labor negotiations, the Kings seem to be rounding into form. They are 4-1 in 
exhibitions and have won three consecutive games, all by one-goal margins. 
</P>
<P>
 They scored four power-play goals against the San Jose Sharks Sunday and 
scored with a man advantage to defeat the Rangers. With Alexei Kovalev off for 
boarding Kevin Todd, King defenseman Alexei Zhitnik scored on a rebound at 
10:52 of the second period, beating goaltender Mike Richter. Assisting on the 
goal were forward Dan Quinn and Blake. Quinn has five points in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky, who was scheduled to play against the Rangers, missed the game 
because of a minor groin injury. "If this was a league game, he could play," 
King General Manager Sam McMaster said. McMaster said Gretzky will probably 
play Friday against Pittsburgh at the Forum. Gretzky has appeared in two 
exhibition games. . . . Former King left wing Luc Robitaille, who was traded to 
the Penguins in July for Rick Tocchet, is not scheduled to play against the 
Kings on Friday but is expected to be in the lineup against the Mighty Ducks on 
Sunday in Anaheim. Tocchet will make his exhibition debut with the Kings on 
Friday.

 Clyde Hollenbeck, the floor manager at the restaurant Sunday night, said he 
got 15 obscenity-laced phone calls from those who couldn't separate the 
restaurant from the coach. 
</P>

 "I told them, 'Look, if you come to the restaurant and have a problem with the

<TEXT>
<P>
 St. Louis Cardinal General Manager Dal Maxvill, who failed to lead the team 
into postseason play his last seven seasons, was fired Wednesday by team 
President Mark Lamping, who has been on the job about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamping gave no specific reasons for the move, other than the fact Maxvill 
couldn't produce a winner.

KARIYA GETS OFFENSIVE IN DUCKS' 4-3 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whatever irksome problems might face the Mighty Ducks before the start of the 
regular season or a lockout, whichever happens first, getting rookie Paul 
Kariya into the offensive flow isn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya again showed why the Ducks are paying him $6.5 million over the next 
three seasons, contributing three assists in a 4-3 victory over the Boston 
Bruins on Wednesday night at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it didn't show in the scoring summary, the Ducks (2-3-1) got another 
assist from goaltender Guy Hebert, who stopped 41 of 44 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Ducks suffered occasional defensive lapses, as has been their method 
of operation in the exhibition season, Hebert kept them in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya's three-point game pushed his five-game exhibition total to a 
team-leading seven (two goals, five assists). He assisted on third-period goals 
by Patrik Carnback and Valeri Karpov within a 3-minute 20-second span, giving 
the Ducks a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul Kariya and Karpov aren't flashes in the pan; they're ready to play a 
dominant role on our team," Duck Coach Ron Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Tuesday, when Boston defeated the Ducks, 3-2, the Bruins skated their 
varsity: defenseman Ray Bourque, right wing Cam Neely and center Adam Oates. 
</P>
<P>
 Oates fed Bourque, standing alone in the slot, for Boston's first goal, on a 
power play at 14:24 of the first period. Bourque also scored a third-period 
goal that brought Boston to within 4-3 with less than seven minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks led, 2-1, after the first period on goals by Tom Kurvers and Joe 
Sacco. Kariya and David Williams assisted on Kurvers' goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston tough guy Marc Potvin, a former King, tied the score, 2-2, 2:19 into 
the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie defenseman Nikolai Tsulygin may be headed back to Russia as the first 
Duck to play for the Central Red Army team, which has a joint working agreement 
with the Ducks and Pittsburgh Penguins. Tsulygin's contract calls for him to 
return to Russia this season rather than play at San Diego of the International 
Hockey League if he fails to make the Duck roster. There also is a possibility 
that Tsulygin, the Ducks' second-round pick in the 1993 entry draft, could go 
back to Salavat Yulayev Ufa of the Russian Elite League. He had 13 points in 45 
games for that team last season. . . . The Ducks play host to the Dallas Stars 
on Friday at The Pond of Anaheim.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; 'AIR MCNAIR' HYPE FLYING HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Lorman, Miss., comes the Heisman Trophy gospel of Alcorn State Coach 
Cardell Jones, who can repeat chapter and verse the reasons why the 
stiff-arming statuette rightfully belongs to his quarterback, Steve McNair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heisman hype, according to Jones: 
</P>
<P>
 Verse No. 1--McNair, he said, "is the best player in the country, bar none." 
</P>
<P>
 Verse No. 2--If McNair were a Division I-A quarterback, not a Division I-AA 
player, we wouldn't be having this discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Verse No. 3--Notre Dame quarterback Ron Powlus and McNair don't belong in the 
same Heisman sentence--at least not yet. Powlus hasn't done enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Verse No. 4--If voters are suspicious about the quality of play in Alcorn 
State's Southwestern Athletic Conference, don't be. Jones said his Braves could 
play in the ultra-difficult Southeastern Conference, home of four top 25-ranked 
teams, and finish .500. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'll tell you one thing, you can take almost any team in the Southeastern 
Conference and if they had to play week in, week out in our conference, it 
would be pretty tough for them to hold up," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Verse No. 5--If the Southwestern Athletic Conference is good enough for Walter 
Payton, Jerry Rice and Grambling Coach Eddie Robinson, the winningest coach in 
college football history, it should be good enough for someone with a Heisman 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Verse No. 6--Jones, who doubles as Alcorn's athletic director, said he tried 
to schedule Division I-A opponents such as Southern Mississippi, Mississippi 
State, Mississippi and Rice, but with no success. 
</P>
<P>
 The official reason for the no-thank-yous: Too late to alter the schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 The unofficial reason: Would you want to risk being embarrassed by McNair? 
</P>
<P>
 Verse No. 7--Have you seen McNair's statistics? They're almost mythical in 
stature. 
</P>
<P>
 Verse No. 8--"He's a combination of Randall Cunningham, Warren Moon and Joe 
Montana," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Verse No. 9--According to at least one NFL scout, McNair could be the first 
selection in the 1995 draft. If nothing else, he has zoomed to the top or near 
the top of the NFL's quarterback prospect rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 Verse No. 10--So good is McNair that he will probably finish as the No. 2 
rusher in the conference. "He's probably as elusive as any of your better 
tailbacks in the country," Jones said. McNAIR MANIA--PART TWO 
</P>
<P>
 If ever there were a year for a little-known Division I-AA quarterback to have 
an actual chance at a Heisman, this is it. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the circumstances: 
</P>
<P>
 Preseason favorite Tyrone Wheatley of Michigan has sat out the first two 
games, though he is expected to play in a back-up role Saturday. . . . UCLA's 
J.J. Stokes hasn't played since the Bruins' opener. . . . USC's Rob Johnson has 
only one touchdown pass. . . . Stanford's Steve Stenstrom has four touchdown 
passes, one against Northwestern, three against San Jose State. . . . Notre 
Dame's Lee Becton is sidelined three to four weeks because of an injury. . . . 
Powlus was shaky against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, McNair keeps putting up numbers that require an abacus to 
comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
 He has completed 72 of 127 passes (57%) for 1,369 yards and 15 touchdowns. He 
accounted for 633 total yards against Grambling and a Division I-AA-record 647 
yards against Tennessee Chattanooga, the same team that held Alabama to 476 
total yards in the season opener. In fact, McNair almost outgained Alabama and 
Tennessee Chattanooga, 655-647. And against Alabama State last Saturday, McNair 
had an off night--only 452 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, the media are noticing. ABC is scheduled to do regional coverage 
of Saturday's game against Sam Houston State. It isn't much--only viewers in 
Mississippi, Louisiana and the Houston area will see the broadcast--but it 
helps. ESPN also is considering Alcorn State's game against Jackson State on 
Nov. 19. McNAIR MANIA--THE END 
</P>
<P>
 So heavy is McNair's bandwagon that it's almost a cliche to ask if he is a 
legitimate Heisman candidate. In essence, the pure number of stories on his 
underdog status has turned him into a legitimate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are problems. A single regional ABC broadcast isn't going to cut 
it. The same goes for a few clips on the weekly highlight shows. Voters need to 
see McNair play a game. A whole game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is this matter of the competition. Nebraska's Tommie Frazier, 
Michigan's Todd Collins, Washington's Napoleon Kaufman and Florida's Terry 
Dean, who has only two fewer touchdown passes than McNair in 50 fewer passing 
attempts, are bona fide stars. Plus, they have high-powered programs, national 
TV appearances and Division I-A pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
 To which Jones said: "I think that's a lot of hogwash. I'm serious about that 
now. The award is supposed to go, quote, unquote, to the best athlete, the best 
football player in the country, regardless of what division, what level, 
whatever. I realize we can't promote him on a national basis. But he's a 
deserving individual, I guarantee that." 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: McNair will get votes, but not the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember 1990? Houston quarterback David Klingler led all of Division I-A with 
5,221 yards, 55 touchdowns and 474.6 yards per game--McNair-like numbers. He 
had one game in which he passed for 716 yards, one for 572 and one for 563. Two 
seasons later he became the sixth player chosen in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of good it did. Klingler finished fifth in the 1990 Heisman balloting. 
NO HARD FEELINGS 
</P>
<P>
 After leading Colorado to a 35-point victory over Northeast Louisiana and a 
38-point victory over Wisconsin, quarterback Kordell Stewart would like to 
extend a heartfelt thank you to . . . Terry Donahue? 
</P>
<P>
 Without the help of the UCLA coach, none of this would have been possible. 
Stewart's completions, touchdowns and efficiency ratings are up, his 
interceptions down. And all because Donahue passed over then-Bruin wide 
receiver coach Rick Neuheisel for the offensive coordinator job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a legitimate, 100% great quarterback and receivers coach," Stewart 
gushed. "It's just unbelievable the way he's teaching me and the way he's made 
my confidence level go up so high." 
</P>
<P>
 Neuheisel, 33, a former Bruin Rose Bowl MVP, desperately wanted to become 
offensive coordinator when Homer Smith returned to Alabama. But Donahue chose 
Texas A&M's Bob Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
 A disappointed (some say peeved) Neuheisel left soon thereafter for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Donahue) thought I was too young and inexperienced, and he was probably 
right," Neuheisel said. "I didn't want to believe it, but he's probably 
correct." 
</P>
<P>
 If Neuheisel holds a grudge, he doesn't show it. Asked if Donahue erred by 
choosing someone else as coordinator, Neuheisel said, "I don't think they made 
a mistake. I think Bob Toledo is a good coordinator. I think he was certainly 
the safe bet. I think that they have a good staff. Coach Donahue hasn't been 
coaching for 20 years without being really good at it. I certainly have the 
utmost respect for him and I think it's worked out for all parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially for Stewart, who can't believe his luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Neuheisel) would have been offensive coordinator, that would have been 
awesome," he said. "But he's my coach." THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 If the NFL and the Professional Football Referees Assn. can't avoid an Oct. 
9-10 strike date, conferences such as the Pacific 10 and the Big Ten are 
prepared to allow their contracted officials to work pro games. "They are free 
to do whatever they wish to do outside the Pac-10, but they must work their 
Pac-10 assignments," Commissioner Tom Hansen said. . . . Big week for the 
soon-to-be Big 12 Conference. League administrators and member programs (the 
existing Big Eight teams, plus Southwest Conference defectors Texas, Texas A&M, 
Texas Tech and Baylor) have begun debate on whether to split into two divisions 
and have a championship game. And if so, where? In Dallas? Kansas City? San 
Antonio? . . . One of the byproducts of the new bowl alliance agreement, which 
begins next season, is the scramble by major conferences to guarantee spots for 
their second-place teams. Under the present agreement, the Pac-10's No. 2 team 
was guaranteed a place in the Orange, Fiesta, Sugar, Cotton, Gator or Hancock 
bowls. The new deal makes no such provisions, which is why Hansen has his 1995 
bowl wish list in place. According to Hansen, the Pac-10 wants its No. 2 
finisher to play the Big 12's No. 2 in the Cotton Bowl or, as a second choice, 
the Alamo Bowl. One problem: the Big Ten might be interested in a similar 
arrangement. The Big Ten is also considering a deal to send its No. 2 team to 
face the SEC's No. 2 in the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne on the early-season glut of powerhouse teams: "It 
looks to me right now seven, eight teams that you probably can throw a hat over 
them and it wouldn't make much of difference who you pulled out." . . . His 
offensive line a mess, Pittsburgh Coach Johnny Majors is thinking of teaching 
new and inventive blocking techniques. "Maybe we'll start biting them," he 
said. "I don't know if that's legal, though." . . . Despite beating Maryland, 
52-20, and Wake Forest, 56-14, Florida State's Bobby Bowden said his staff was 
outcoached by both teams. . . . Let the Pac-10 bashing begin. The league is 2-5 
against the Western Athletic Conference and 10-9-1 overall in nonconference 
games. Winless California has two of the embarrassing defeats, one to San Diego 
State and one to Hawaii. The latest loss came at home. "They were so cocky," 
Hawaii's Matthew Harding said after the game. "I mean, it makes you want to win 
by 50. They were taunting us, saying, 'This is Pac-10 ball. You don't belong 
here. You need to go back to the Aloha State.' " They did--with a victory. . . 
. Alabama Birmingham, a Division I-AA program making the jump to I-A in 1996, 
plays Kansas on Saturday. This is some coaching staff the Blazers have. The 
head coach is Dr. Jim Hilyer, whose wife, Dr. Lynn Artz, is the special teams 
coach. For what it's worth, she attended Penn State and Tennessee. Former Ram 
quarterback Dieter Brock is the offensive coordinator. Other assistant coaches 
include a highway patrolman and a bookstore owner. The Top 10

 After knee surgery and on the road to recovery, Paul Kennedy made his first 
appearance at UCLA practice Wednesday and said that he would ask the NCAA for 
another season of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, who was injured in the season's second game, against Southern 
Methodist, had worked for four seasons to get playing time. In his fifth year 
at Westwood, he finally achieved his goal: starting at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 plays later, it was over. Now he wants some more plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure how, but I want to try for one more year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what the NCAA will do but I've got to try. If I'm meant to play 
football at UCLA, I'll play."

 After Bennett is sentenced Monday, the issue will be turned over to the Dean 
of Students, Kerry Porter, and Pete Dalis, UCLA's athletic director.

 Bennett was arrested on campus in the spring and suspended from the athletic 
program.

 A recent Time magazine report ranked the Associated Press top 25 of the first 
week of September by the most recent graduation report by the NCAA. It showed 
that Penn State was No. 1, graduating 92% of its players, with UCLA No. 2 at 
85%. In UCLA's case, that represents 17 of 20 scholarship athletes from the 
freshman year measured -- 1987-88 -- giving students six years to graduate, 
regardless of whether they finished their careers at UCLA. Others in the poll: 
Michigan 81%, Stanford 76% and USC 42%. JIM HODGES

TENNESSEE COACH

 Florida Coach Steve Spurrier, saying he will "keep my big mouth shut," 
apologized to Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer for comments he made Monday at the 
Jacksonville Quarterback Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurrier's remarks were about Fulmer knocking his own team's chances before 
the Gators' 31-0 victory over Tennessee Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurrier pointed out that Tennessee had the top-ranked recruiting class in the 
nation last year and had seven NFL first-round draft picks in the last four 
years, compared to one for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phil wanted to tell everybody the Gators have had the best personnel over the 
last four or five years, which is a good little cop-out for coaches who are not 
winning," Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida coach said Tuesday that he sent a letter to Fulmer, explaining his 
comments. He also issued a public apology.

<P>
 Baylor's freshman quarterback, Jeff Watson, has led 10 touchdown drives in two 
starts and taken his team to a 3-0 record in preparing to play USC at 7 p.m. 
Saturday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Oklahoma State last weekend, Watson brought Baylor from behind twice 
to win, 14-10.Watson and wide receiver John Stanley connected on an 81-yard 
touchdown pass play in the third quarter and he and tight end Damon Rhynes 
connected on a 70-yard scoring pass play in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Baylor defeated Louisiana Tech, 44-3, and San Jose State, 54-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson has completed 22 of 40 passes, with five touchdowns and one 
interception. Of Baylor's 1,161 total offensive yards, 675 have been accounted 
for by freshmen. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Defensive coordinator Don Lindsey still is evaluating film, trying to figure 
out how his players went from an outstanding performance against Washington to 
giving up 534 yards in a 38-14 loss at Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're an enigma. . . . I don't know yet what we are," Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Against Washington, we got six sacks and five turnovers. Normally, you rant 
and rave when a defense has a game like that.  
</P>
<P>
 "Against Penn State, we were playing one of the best offensive teams in the 
country. I go into these games as a realist, but I also think we always have a 
chance to win." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson was talking about the "quickness" of little-used wide 
receiver Ryan Lenderman, who is 5-11 and 180 pounds. Someone noticed he is on 
the depth chart as the backup long snapper for placekicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's also the holder," Robinson said. EARL GUSTKEY

UCLA OPPONENT TACKLES RIVALS, SOCIAL ILLS WITH GUSTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometime Saturday, if form holds and the UCLA offensive line doesn't, DeWayne 
Patterson is going to get up off quarterback Wayne Cook and wave to the 
television cameras at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Oakland, some students at McClymonds High are going to remember when 
he visited them in the summer and think, "that's for us." It will be, at least 
in part. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're always in the back of my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because his ties with the East Bay are always there. Every time he 
leaves Washington State for a break, he returns to see another Victorian home 
restored, another project torn down. What doesn't change is McClymonds, which 
has stood for almost 90 years, and the kids who are trying to get out of West 
Oakland. They are gentrifying the area, but it's still not a place where you 
want to go out at night. 
</P>
<P>
 It's his message, and that of the school's teachers: Get out, and return as a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 He does, as an All-Pacific 10 defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see so many guys down there with athletic ability," Patterson said. "In 
my class there were a lot of guys with huge athletic ability, and the only 
things holding them back were SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) scores or they 
don't have the right math class. It holds them back for the rest of their 
lives. They get a job and stay in the same environment, and they never get a 
chance to step up out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 They talk the talk. They are going to be stars like Bill Russell, the Celtics' 
legend; like Jimmy Hines, for years the world's fastest human; like Hall of 
Fame baseball player Frank Robinson and Vada Pinson. Like Joe Ellis and Nate 
Williams of the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 They are McClymonds' alumni who took the necessary steps to ensure the dream 
didn't die. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson heard. Some only listen. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a starter at tight end as a freshman, and by his sophomore season 
college recruiters came to look at teammates Marcel Wade, Ivory Irvins and 
Brian Baldwin, all of whom went to Pac-10 schools. There were other athletes 
who didn't make it because of academic difficulties. Patterson saw their 
problems and quickly figured out their futures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured if they could play college football, I could," he said. "But 
knowing what I can do and then being able to do it was what counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has a choice of what they want to do with their life. At a certain 
point in my life, I decided that I didn't want to be stuck down there and be a 
statistic -- dead or in jail one day. I wanted to go to college, play football 
and be on TV. Everybody has a motivation in life, but whether they do anything 
with it is up to them." 
</P>
<P>
 His motivation came early, and it was reinforced, at home and at school. 
Charles Patterson was an Oakland bus driver who was often at school, never 
missing a game or an open house. He knew the teachers and the coaches and made 
certain they knew whom to call in the event of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had parents who made sure he studied," said Lu Paulette Taylor, an English 
teacher who has employed DeWayne as a house-sitter during his summer visits 
from Washington State. "It's all I would have to say, 'I'm going to call your 
father,' and that would keep him in line." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Patterson: "I knew she was going to say that. Pops was kind of strict on 
me in high school. He's a big guy, kind of intimidating, so they knew he would 
keep me in line." 
</P>
<P>
 Ella Gordon, his mother, was the same way at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't go to football games, and only now, after watching me on TV for 
four years, is she understanding the game," Patterson said. "But she told me, 
'There's life after football; you never know if you're going to get hurt.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The message was received again. He is 22 hours from a degree in criminal 
justice, and the intent to finish what he has started is strong. 
</P>
<P>
 By his senior season, he was ready -- except for a qualifying score on his 
entrance exam. He took the test five times to get the required 700, and visited 
Washington, Washington State and Oregon State. California was in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let one of the coaches (at Washington State) talk me out of going there," 
Patterson said. "He told me it would be good to get out of that environment and 
go to a little city, and that's basically what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Folks at McClymonds agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the kids that go away to college have the most success," said 
Ralph Bellamy, who has 20 years at the school, some of them as an assistant 
football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach who lured him to Pullman, Tom Loppano, is now the assistant head 
coach at Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman, Patterson analyzed the situation and decided that a career at 
tight end at McClymonds wasn't going to continue at Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I had before that was tight end, touchdown," he said. "At Washington 
State I was playing behind Butch Williams (who has played with three NFL teams) 
and Brett Carolan (who signed with San Francisco), so I wanted to move to the 
other side of the ball, because it wasn't that deep. When I first got here, we 
were an offensive school." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars had Drew Bledsoe, the first pick in the 1993 NFL draft, at 
quarterback. With Bledsoe gone, the emphasis is on defense. Patterson is one of 
the reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 After a redshirt season, he became a starter. He is really a 6-foot-1, 
248-pound linebacker playing defensive end, and his specialty is the sack. He 
has a school-record 27, and had three in Washington State's 24-3 victory over 
Fresno State two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Against UCLA last season, even though the Cougars gave up 40 points, he 
intercepted a Rob Walker pass and returned it 89 yards for a touchdown, caused 
two fumbles, recovering one, and had three sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of opportunities to wave at the kids at McClymonds. 
</P>
<P>
 At season's end, he returned, again with a message. It's the same one he got 
so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing wrong with McClymonds High School, but you want to get out of 
Oakland and see that there's a lot out of the inner city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Washington State gave me a good opportunity to get away, to learn that 
there's something else beyond Oakland, instead of staying there doing the same 
things."

VOLLNOGLE READY TO FACE HIS FORMER TEAM; FOOTBALL: LONG-TIME CARSON COACH IS 
NOW AN ASSISTANT AT LOS ALAMITOS, WHICH PLAYS THE COLTS TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gene Vollnogle maneuvered through a throng of well-wishers as the clock wound 
down, stopping every few feet to accept handshakes, congratulatory slaps on the 
back and heartfelt hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollnogle, Carson High's venerable football coach, had just led the Colts to 
the 1990 City Section 4-A Division championship with a 37-16 victory over 
archrival Wilmington Banning at El Camino College in Torrance. The greatest 
reign in state high school football history closed fittingly as Vollnogle 
slowly walked off the field with the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight he takes the field against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a Los Alamitos assistant, the retired Vollnogle -- No. 1 on the state's 
all-time victory list -- will try to help the Griffins beat Carson in a 7 p.m. 
game at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. After three decades spent teaching 
Carson's players to win, he's hoping they won't tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bit more than just another game for me," Vollnogle said. "I did 
spend 28 years there, and I still know the coaches, a lot of people in the 
community and a lot of the teachers over there. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we are out there to beat them. In that respect, when it comes down to the 
football part, it's just another game." 
</P>
<P>
 Vollnogle's involvement with Los Alamitos started because of a gathering about 
X's and O's. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin Coach John Barnes and Vollnogle attended a coaching clinic in San 
Diego in 1988. They spoke at the clinic's conclusion and Vollnogle casually 
mentioned he might like to help coach lower-level football at Los Alamitos when 
he retired after the 1990 season. Vollnogle and his wife of 43 years, Lucile, 
are longtime Los Alamitos residents and their children are Griffin alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called him one day after the football season (in 1990)," said Barnes, who 
asked, " 'Are you ready to put your money where your mouth is?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indecisiveness is not a Vollnogle trait. 
</P>
<P>
 Vollnogle, 63, has coached the Griffin junior varsity since 1991. He has 
worked with receivers and offensive linemen as a varsity assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes said the scheduling of the game has nothing to do with Vollnogle. Both 
schools have powerful programs, which creates problems finding willing 
nonleague opponents. Barnes thought the game would be good for Los Alamitos. 
Vollnogle's involvement, however, just makes it more special, Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has really worked out great," Barnes said. "He wanted to gear down and 
we needed a great guy. We have the perfect guy who can coach." 
</P>
<P>
 In 38 years as a head coach (28 at Carson and 10 at Banning), Vollnogle's 
record is 289-73-1. He won the major City Section title eight times at Carson 
and twice at Banning, a section record. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, scores of Vollnogle's former players received Division I 
scholarships and professional football contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever people ask me about Coach Vollnogle, I always say he's the most 
important person in my football life," said Atlanta Falcon rookie quarterback 
Perry Klein, who helped guide Carson to the 1988 4-A Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best person I've ever been involved with in football. He's the best 
guy and the best coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, BYU All-American quarterback John Walsh can't praise Vollnogle 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene is the greatest coach I've ever played under," said Walsh, who led 
Carson to the 1990 4-A Division title. "There's no doubt in my mind he's the 
greatest (high school) coach ever in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Vollnogle is still revered at Carson, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling on campus is that we're going against the master," Carson 
Principal Dhyan Lal said. "People aren't even thinking about the head coach 
over there; we're playing Gene Vollnogle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a legend." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vollnogle is an integral member of the Griffins' staff, he does miss 
being the head coach -- sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of difference in the time commitment," he said. "I'm not so 
intense as far as watching film. I used to take film home during the week and 
study it, but I don't anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also don't miss the eligibility problems and checking on kids to make sure 
they're going to class. The only thing I miss a little is calling plays. I do 
get to do that during the (junior varsity) games, so it's not so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The Carson football program became unstable after the departure of its 
all-time play-caller. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson has had three coaches since 1990. Like other successful programs, the 
supporters always want more. Pressure from the community created rough moments 
for each new coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed in all the turmoil that's happened over there," Vollnogle 
said. "I know all the coaches and I know how hard they've all worked; how 
dedicated they are. I'm sorry things worked out the way they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Things seem to have improved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts won the 4-A championship last season under first-year Coach David 
Williams. The Colts (0-2) have started slowly, but this follows a trend. They 
also opened last season with consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if anybody plays a tougher schedule," Vollnogle said. "I think 
they'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 And Vollnogle is doing OK, too. 
</P>
<P>
 He's in excellent shape, bursting with enthusiasm and plans to be a part of 
Los Alamitos football for a long time. Besides, that's the way Lucile wants it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't play golf and he doesn't fish," Lucile said, "so this is the only 
way I get him out of the house." CARSON VS. LOS ALAMITOS

ANGELS FIRE COACHES MACHA AND OLIVERAS 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels fired third base coach Ken Macha and first base coach Max Oliveras 
Wednesday and will replace them from within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Macha, who still will manage the Angels' entry in the Arizona Fall League, and 
Oliveras each will be given an opportunity to stay as a minor league 
coach.Macha is expected to reject the offer; Oliveras still is considering it. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann has decided to retain Bobby Knoop as his bench 
coach, batting coach Rod Carew, pitching coach Chuck Hernandez and bullpen 
coach Joe Maddon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through this before, and I'll get through it," Macha said. 
"Hopefully, the Arizona Fall League will provide me some opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Macha, 43, hand-picked by former manager Buck Rodgers, has been a major league 
coach the last seven seasons, the last two with the Angels. Oliveras, 48, who 
spent nine years in the Angel organization, was coaching in the majors for the 
first time this season. BOB NIGHTENGALE

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: CAR WAS FOR SALE WHEN HIS SHIP CAME IN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Kenny Smith won the Pro-Four Modified division main event last Saturday 
night at Saugus Speedway, he had a "For Sale" sign on the window of his blue 
and red No. 43 Chevrolet Lumina. It was Smith's eighth victory in 14 races this 
season and he had won the track championship, but he had also run out of money 
to finance his long-standing hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the El Monte driver took the sign off the car. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Marylou, had just won the Super Lotto and its $24-million 
prize. He will collect $883,000, after taxes, for the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 46, has been racing cars regularly in Southern California since he was 
16 at tracks such as Riverside Raceway, Irwindale, Speedway 605, Orange Show 
Speedway and Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kenny called the track this morning and left a message," said Jim White, 
public relations director at Saugus. "He didn't say what he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he wanted to buy the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith told NASCAR Winston Racing Series officials that he might purchase a 
Southwest Tour car to drive next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan's restaurant in Azusa, where the Smiths purchased their winning 
ticket, had been one of the car's sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus Speedway will close its season Saturday night with its annual Fall 
Spectacular, a group of three 50-lap races for sportsman, Grand American 
modified and Figure 8s, plus a 25-lap train race and a destruction derby. Smith 
is not expected to drive as his class completed its season last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-lapper for sportsman cars, the top of the line at Saugus, will be the 
last of the series. Next year, owner-promoter Roy Wilkings will discontinue the 
series because of its expense to competitors and replace it with a late model 
stock class, similar to the pro stock division raced this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The sportsman cars were getting so expensive that the fields were getting 
smaller and smaller, Wilkings said. By making late models the track's premier 
series, he believed the track would have a better program with more cars next 
year for fans and competitors alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Woodside, 23, a second-generation driver from Saugus, won his first 
sportsman track championship, beating Ron Daniels of San Bernardino, Craig 
Rayburn of Sun Valley and Gary Sigman of Carson in the season-long series. 
Woodside grew up around the track as both his father, Larry, and his mother, 
Pamm, are former Saugus drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodside also hopes to move up to the Southwest Tour, which already includes 
such former Saugus veterans as Ron Hornaday Jr., Lance Hooper and Bob Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Phipps of Simi Valley won his seventh track title and his fourth in a row 
in the Grand American modified division. His first three championships came as 
a sportsman driver in 1984, 1987 and 1988. He is the only champion the Grand 
Ams have known since the series was started in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Saugus champions include Brian Kelly of Arleta, pro stock; John Schultz 
of Valencia, street stock; and Jeff McCall of Gardena, mini stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SPEEDWAY BIKES -- Costa Mesa Speedway will play host to an Interstate 
Challenge Friday night at the Orange County Fairgrounds as a final tuneup for

SPLASH SEASON HAD A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING; ANALYSIS: TEAM TOOK SOME CHANCES AND 
REACHED A FEW GOALS. HOWEVER, IT DID NOT GET A LEAGUE TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Splash's inaugural Continental Indoor Soccer League season was a 
combination of good, bad and comical. 
</P>
<P>
 The good involved the team's regular-season play and its increased attendance 
late in the season, which gave team administrators hope that they've really 
latched on to something. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad involved the Splash's playoff performance, in which it was swept by 
Las Vegas in the CISL semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The comical involved the team's accommodations for its first-round playoff 
series in Sacramento; players went to the hotel bar only to find themselves in 
the middle of the Transvestites Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Most impressive was the team's regular season, during which the Splash had the 
league's second-best record, 20-8, despite starting from near-scratch. It was 
testimony to Coach George Fernandez, who was named the CISL coach of the year, 
and to co-Governor Tim Orchard's ability to assemble a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard had the team in place before he hired Fernandez -- his college 
roommate from Cal State Hayward -- on May 6, one month before the season began. 
Orchard provided plenty of skill players and enough depth to get the team 
through key injuries to midfielders Sam George (who missed 22 games) and 
Armando Valdivia (seven), as well as late-season suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The talent was obvious. Ralph Black, acquired in a trade with Portland, was 
named the league's defender of the year. Black was a first-team All-CISL 
performer, midfielder Doug Neely was a second-team selection and forward Dale 
Ervine and midfielder Raffaele Ruotolo were on the honorable mention team. Paul 
McDonnell made the all-rookie team. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the team is on the right track. And it appeared destined to reach the 
championship series, given some of its dramatic victories to win the home-field 
advantage through the first two rounds, such as the time it scored with a tenth 
of a second to complete a three-goal, fourth-quarter comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played great right up to the first game (of the playoffs)," Fernandez 
said. "Then we hit the wall. And that's shocking to me. It's just nauseating." 
</P>
<P>
 How nauseating? The Splash won only two of its five playoff games, as 
individual players tried to do too much rather than play selflessly. Four 
players scored 30 goals or more during the 28-game regular season; only one, 
Rod Castro, averaged a goal a game in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the team did let down in the playoffs, it rallied at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 The average attendance through the Splash's first 11 home games -- in which 
the team was 10-1 -- was 4,213. It then went 27 days in August without a home 
game. Upon returning, the team averaged 6,581, which would have been 
fourth-best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance should be bolstered next year by more choice arena dates, which 
weren't available this year because Ogden Facility Management -- which owns the 
team and runs The Pond -- never had the team's front-office operations going 
until April. 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably, the front office is as optimistic about its off-field goals as 
it is about the team's championship hopes next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have the caliber of play we had this year, and I have nine months to 
promote the sport instead of 60 days, I don't think a Friday or Saturday night 
with 10,000 in the stands is unrealistic," General Manager Tim Ryan said. "For 
a family of four to come to a live, professional sporting event for as little 
as $16, I don't see how we can go wrong next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Already Ryan has seen the effects of the team's play on ticket sales. Before 
Aug. 28 -- the Splash's first game back from the seven-game trip -- there were 
318 season tickets sold between $72 and $140. Since then, 368 have been sold. 
Ryan's goal is 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ahead of schedule," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not unusual, given that this team went from being the most inept 
franchise in 1993 as the L.A. United, to being one of the league's most 
respected -- and best -- in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's good.

FAIRPLEX; STEWARDS SUSPEND JOCKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jockey Brian Long has been suspended indefinitely by Fairplex Park stewards 
because he failed to appear at a hearing Monday to answer questions about a 
sexual harassment charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge was made by female jockey Joy Scott, who told stewards that Long 
was often grabbing at her and once danced naked on a stool in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
 Long and Antonio Castanon engaged in a whip-to-whip fight during the stretch 
run of a race at Hollywood Park last summer. After the race, Long went after 
Castanon and the two went at it again in the middle of the track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do this to create more problems for him, but it was getting worse," 
Scott said. "He just wouldn't listen. He would grab my rear and I would have to 
slap his hand away, but that wouldn't stop him from doing it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that men act like men and I can let a lot of things go by, but not 
this. I've been riding since 1981 and always have been respected by the male 
riders. When he danced naked on the stool, that was the icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
 The day after she made the complaint, Scott claimed Long verbally abused her 
and spit in her face. 
</P>
<P>
 Steward David Samuel said that Long called the track Tuesday, but did not 
indicate when he would return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until he appears, he will remain suspended," Samuel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Fleet, ridden by Scott Stevens, caught and passed 4-5 favorite Candid 
Moments in deep stretch to post a neck victory in Wednesday's $110,000 Barretts 
Debutante, the 6 1/2-furlong 11th-race feature for 2-year-old fillies who were 
offered for sale at a Barretts auction. Corey Nakatani sent Candid Moments to 
the lead going around the first turn, but Artica, ridden by Fernando 
Valenzuela, challenged for the lead during the entire backstretch to set the 
race up for Tina Fleet's stretch run. . . . Post time for the first race will 
be 1 p.m., beginning Saturday and will remain at that time for the remainder of 
the meet

BADMINTON'S FIRST FAMILY; BRITTONS BEMOAN THE SPORT'S STATUS IN AMERICA, BUT 
DOMINATE IT HEADING INTO TOP EVENT AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't look for the Britton family to play badminton at the company picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 Badminton is far too serious for that. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, it rankles badminton players that the sport is considered a 
recreation by most of the United States. It's not even an outdoor game. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easily the fastest racket sport: The shuttlecock -- not the birdie -- 
has been timed at speeds up to 200 m.p.h. Singles players can expect to run the 
equivalent of eight miles in a match.  
</P>
<P>
 So it's offensive to most players that badminton is not considered a serious 
sport. That puts badminton in line with soccer as a popular sport ignored in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Badminton is so popular in Asia that all of the Barcelona Olympic matches were 
shown on television in most Asian countries. The United States' feed didn't 
show any.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from Scotland, and everyone plays badminton there and through most of 
Europe -- it's just behind soccer," said John Britton, who came to the United 
States to coach the now-defunct L.A. Heat outdoor soccer team and joined the 
Manhattan Beach Badminton Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Asian countries (badminton) is even bigger -- it's a way out for the lower 
classes. A lot like basketball is viewed here. That's where your best players 
in the world are from." 
</P>
<P>
 Britton has some good players right in his own back yard -- if he would excuse 
the expression. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a family that has won a tidy share of national titles. 
</P>
<P>
 John Britton has won five. 
</P>
<P>
 Traci Britton has won three. 
</P>
<P>
 And, watch out, their daughter Jaymie has won 10 at the junior level. 
</P>
<P>
 That count includes titles in singles, doubles and mixed doubles -- mixed 
doubles in badminton circles does not suffer from a prestige problem any more 
than the rest of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Traci will be looking to relive some of their glory in the U.S. Open, 
which starts at 3 p.m. today at Pauley Pavilion. The competition will run 
through Sunday, when the finals start at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Traci Britton and partner Tariq Wadood will try to reclaim the U.S. Open mixed 
doubles title they won in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 John Britton and partner Gary Higgins will try to win the men's doubles title 
for the first time since 1985. They also won in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, John and Traci met at the Manhattan Beach Badminton Club. A 
badminton dynasty, of sorts, was born. However, they don't play mixed doubles 
together because "We wanted to stay married," Traci said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two more potential champions on the horizon as their sons Tommy, 11, 
and Andrew, 9, also play regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Brittons seem a little old to be champions, they won't acknowledge it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Age has little to do with it," Traci Britton said. "John likes to say we're 
over 40 and that's all, but I say we're no age. Some people have this 
preconceived idea that the younger and fitter should win. The game is from the 
wrist, not the arms like in other racket sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the game is 80% mental in that you have to set up your opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a game like tennis, where Pete Sampras keeps attacking," he said. 
"It's more like chess. You have to set up positioning and returns to force your 
opponent out of position."  
</P>
<P>
 No matter what age, badminton players in this country are a long way from 
reaching international prominence. The U.S. Open is a good start because it 
receives more domestic exposure than most badminton events. No player from the 
United States advanced past the round of 16 in the 1993 Open.  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't do a player much good to travel to an international tournament and 
lose quickly in the first round," said John Britton, who has organized nearly a 
dozen sanctioned U.S. team tours to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "You gain much more by playing more and going deeper into the tournament. 
That's why it's far more productive to spend $10,000 playing a tour with games 
against the European countries or Australia than it is to go play in Asia and 
lose in the first round. We're not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The first and second rounds will be today and Friday at 3 p.m., the semifinals 
will be in two sessions on Saturday (1-5 p.m. and 6-10 p.m.) and the finals 
will start at 1 p.m. Sunday.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: FAURIA PAWING GROUND TO GET AT MICHIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bring on Michigan, Colorado tight end Christian Fauria says. The Buffaloes are 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-ranked Colorado trounced Rose Bowl champion Wisconsin, 55-17, last 
week. On the schedule this week is No. 4 Michigan. If another stampede takes 
place in Ann Arbor, Mich., Saturday, No. 1 Florida, No. 2 Nebraska and No. 3 
Florida State should be apprised that the Buffaloes have been up this mountain 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 So says Fauria, a 6-foot-4, 235-pound senior from Crespi High. 
</P>
<P>
 Fauria was a redshirt freshman in January, 1991, when the Buffaloes beat Notre 
Dame, 10-9, in the Orange Bowl and earned a share of the national championship 
for the 1990 season with Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't get a taste of it, but I remember the feeling," said Fauria, 
who scored the final touchdown in the Wisconsin blowout on a five-yard pass 
from reserve quarterback Koy Detmer. "And the feeling around here this week is 
the same. It's electric." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado will be short-circuited if it cannot beat a Michigan team that -- 
according to Fauria -- is bigger, stronger and faster than Wisconsin. But there 
is no telling how explosive the Buffalo offense can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The offense) made a lot of mistakes against Wisconsin, which you couldn't 
see," he said. "It's been a lot better -- like in practice. We believe we can 
compete for the national championship." 
</P>
<P>
 For Fauria, the years following Colorado's 1990 title have been good. A 
starter the past two seasons, Fauria ranks eighth on Colorado's career list in 
receptions (68) and needs only 19 more to climb to fifth. With 24 more 
receptions, Fauria would have more than any other tight end in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 In receiving yardage, Fauria ranks 13th with 739. He needs only 134 more to 
pass the late J.V. Cain, also a tight end, and move into 10th position. 
</P>
<P>
 Fauria, who turns 23 today, isn't focused on the numbers and has resigned 
himself to his role in a high-powered offense that features three highly touted 
players -- quarterback Kordell Stewart, running back Rashaan Salaam and wide 
receiver Michael Westbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all great," Fauria said. "I'd like to think I'm the fourth weapon. I 
tell myself, as long as they throw me at least one ball a game I'll be happy. 
Back in the old days I might have said, 'This is baloney. Give me the ball.' 
But I've aged a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Fauria played the latter part of last season with a stress fracture in his 
pelvic bone. Six months of rehabilitation excluded him from spring workouts. 
During the layoff, Fauria hit the books and graduated with a degree in 
communications, carrying a B average. He is enrolled in four undergraduate 
classes this fall. On the field, he's had to play catch-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've not been close to doing the things I want to do," Fauria said. "I'd like 
to be perfect on every play and get more explosiveness out of my stance." 
</P>
<P>
 Still sore from the Wisconsin game, Fauria said Tuesday he was ready to block 
a Wolverine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait for Michigan," he said. "I'm pumped now." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Relief for the Mustangs: Linebacker Brett Sibert (Calabasas) went to Dallas 
hoping to help Southern Methodist return to glory. SMU suffered the so-called 
death penalty and was banned from playing in 1987-88 for rules violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, the Mustangs have struggled, posting a 12-44-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago in the Rose Bowl, Sibert was tormented by the 17-10 defeat to 
then 13th-ranked UCLA. SMU had first and goal at the three-yard line with 1 
minute 22 seconds left and couldn't score. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have shocked the world, and that was our goal," said Sibert, a 
walk-on sophomore who plays on special teams. "We had victory at hand and we 
couldn't complete it." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a near identical circumstance last week, SMU succeeded. Quarterback 
Ramon Flanigan's seven-yard touchdown pass to Brian Berry with three seconds 
left gave the Mustangs a 34-31 victory over New Mexico at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got scary, but it was a thrill in the end," Sibert said. "We need to show 
the nation we're players who were recruited to play in a big-time program 
that's back on the rise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country: Freshman running back Ed Williams (Canyon) rushed for 115 
yards in 23 carries during St. Mary's 45-21 victory over Sonoma State at 
Moraga. Williams scored on runs of 20 and two yards, caught a pass for four 
yards and had four kick returns for 75 yards. . . . University of San Diego 
junior defensive back Jesse Hall (St. Francis) is second on the team with 31 
tackles, 10 unassisted. 
</P>
<P>
 California lost to a Western Athletic Conference opponent for the second 
consecutive week, despite a strong effort by junior wide receiver Iheanyi 
Uwaezuoke (Harvard-Westlake). Uwaezuoke had eight receptions for 115 yards in 
the 21-7 defeat to Hawaii at Berkeley. He caught seven for 88 yards in a 22-20 
loss to San Diego State the previous week. Uwaezuoke leads the Pacific 10 
Conference in receiving with 7.5 catches per game (15 for 203 yards). 
</P>
<P>
 Junior running back LaKarlos Townsend (San Fernando) rushed for 99 yards in 
Ohio University's 5-0 setback to Utah State. The Bobcats gained only 99 net 
yards on 33 rushes.

DIGEST: SHUBIN TO START FOR WESTLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior Brian Shubin, who has played at five different schools in four seasons, 
has been named the starting quarterback for Westlake High's game Friday night 
against Hart at Newbury Park High. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Scott Spruill had started the Warriors' first two games, passing for 
375 yards and four touchdowns.Shubin also played in both games, passing for 153 
yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said I was going to use the nonleague games to make a decision and I 
haven't given Shubin enough reps to make a decision," Coach Jim Benkert said. 
"Spruill started two, and to be fair, I need to give Shubin a chance to start 
and face game conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Benkert said Spruill also will play Friday night. The third quarterback who 
had been in the running for the starting job, junior Steve Aylsworth, will 
likely remain at defensive back the rest of the season, Benkert said. JEFF

 Injury-prone Chris Miller will be unable to play Sunday against the Kansas 
City Chiefs, and Chris Chandler will make his first regular-season start for 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams said Wednesday that Miller will sit out because of sore ribs and a 
pinched nerve in his right throwing shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "My shoulder is inflamed and I still don't have all the feeling back in my 
fingertips," said Miller, who has had several injuries in his eight-year NFL 
career and has undergone two knee surgeries in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, signed by the Rams in the off-season as insurance for the 
oft-injured Miller, worked with the first string on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve quarterback T.J. Rubley, who started seven games last season, is on 
the injured-reserve list because of tendinitis in his right throwing elbow, 
leaving Chandler and Tommy Maddox as the team's only sound quarterbacks. MIKE

 Desperate for defense, the Denver Broncos brought back one of their old 
warriors, signing 35-year-old safety Dennis Smith. The hard-hitting Smith, 
entering his 14th season for the Broncos, is expected to start Monday night 
against the Buffalo Bills at Buffalo. . . . The San Francisco 49ers shook up 
their secondary to make room for Deion Sanders, who will start at right 
cornerback against New Orleans on Sunday. Merton Hanks moves from right corner 
to free safety, bumping Dana Hall from the lineup. . . . The winless Arizona 
Cardinals, looking for help on offense, gave tryouts to running back Barry Word 
and quarterback Rich Gannon.

 Raider assistant coaches Tom Walsh and Bill Meyers are threatening legal 
action over a story that they fought in the Coliseum press box during the 
Raiders' 38-9 loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I said was, 'Run the damn ball,' " Meyers, the offensive line coach, said 
of his confrontation with Walsh, the offensive coordinator."We have plenty of 
witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell later took the blame for not running the ball enough in that 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Some versions of that feud grew to include a fist-swinging brawl and the 
involvement of owner Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh and Meyers are demanding a retraction from Fred Edelstein, a former ESPN 
reporter who publishes a pro football newsletter.

 Final reflection on the Raiders' 0-2 start: Running back Harvey Williams, 
asked about the mood on the club, said, "The first two weeks around here, it 
was like somebody's mom died." . . . Defensive end Willie Broughton, sidelined 
because of an elbow injury since the preseason, is participating fully in 
practice and is close to being ready for game action. STEVE SPRINGER

Alabama. . . . William White, the Chiefs' starting free safety, suffered a 
sprained ankle and is questionable for Sunday's game. . . . Kansas City

CHANDLER TO START AGAINST CHIEFS; RAMS: MILLER WILL SIT OUT SUNDAY'S GAME 
BECAUSE OF SORE RIBS AND A PINCHED NERVE IN HIS SHOULDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now just what was the over-under this season on how long it would be before 
Chris Chandler replaced Chris Miller as the Rams' starting quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 That's right -- three games. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury-prone Miller will be unable to play Sunday against the Kansas City 
Chiefs, and Chandler will make his first regular-season start as a Ram. 
</P>
<P>
 The team made it official Wednesday, announcing that Miller will sit out 
because of his sore ribs and a pinched nerve in his right throwing shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "My shoulder is inflamed and I still don't have all the feeling back in my 
fingertips," said Miller, who has had several injuries in his eight-year NFL 
career and has undergone two knee surgeries in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would just be a good time to rest the ribs and the shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 So it's only a precautionary measure? 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could, I would play this weekend, and I'm sure I could get it medically 
to where I could," Miller said. "But if I keep getting hit and keep irritating 
it, it'll continue to be a pain in the . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, signed by the Rams in the off-season as insurance for Miller, worked 
with the first string Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-string quarterback Tommy Maddox, acquired in an Aug. 27 trade with 
Denver, will back up Chandler, Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said Miller's injury-prone rap may have convinced Miller to stay in 
the Sunday's 34-19 loss to San Francisco after he suffered the pinched nerve 
when Dana Stubblefield in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know who decides these labels on people," Chandler said. "People are 
going to decide that (Notre Dame quarterback) Ron Powlus is a superstar as a 
freshman, only because the media just decides he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will decide that Miller is injury-prone just because the media decides 
he is. People don't say that about Randall Cunningham, although Randall 
probably has been hurt more than Chris has. It's just unfair, that whole 
process of labeling, there's just no basis for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who signed a three-year, $9-million deal with the Rams in March, 
missed the Rams' exhibition opener at Green Bay with a sore abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler started in his place, completing nine of 18 passes for 149 yards with 
no touchdowns and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is still bothered by sore ribs from the regular-season opener when he 
was hit by Arizona's Eric Swann. He received three pain-killing injections in 
his rib cage for the Atlanta game and got an injection in his shoulder after 
pinching the nerve Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck and I talked about this Tuesday," Miller said. "The best thing to do is 
get it right, let it heal, take a break and then get on top of my game." 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve quarterback T.J. Rubley, who started seven games last season, is on 
the injured-reserve list with tendinitis in his right throwing elbow, leaving 
Chandler and Maddox as the team's only healthy quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said the Rams will bring Miller on the trip as the emergency quarterback 
in case Chandler and Maddox are injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could put Miller in there in a disaster-plan role," Knox said. "He could 
hand the ball off." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler has lost battles for starting jobs with Vinny Testaverde at Tampa Bay 
and with Steve Beuerlein at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 He has started 39 games in a seven-year NFL career with Indianapolis, Tampa 
Bay and most recently, Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 He started 13 games as a rookie in Indianapolis in 1988, completing 55.4% of 
his passes with eight touchdowns and 12 interceptions. In 1992, he started 13 
games with Arizona before losing his starting job to Beuerlein last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last regular-season start, Arizona's 20-15 loss at Dallas on Nov. 14, 
1993, Chandler completed 27 of 46 passes for 214 yards with one touchdown and 
one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler has come in the past two games in relief of Miller, completing 18 of 
32 passes (56.3%) for one touchdown and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox coveted Chandler in the off-season, pursuing him for a while as a 
possible starter.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; HENLEY ARRANGES FOR $600,000 BAIL BOND 
</P>

<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley met the final demand of his bail obligation Wednesday 
when a bail bondsman pledged to post a $600,000 bond that will keep Henley out 
of jail on cocaine conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley broke a 3 p.m. deadline to secure the bond, which a federal judge 
ordered two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastily called off the practice field Wednesday, Henley went into the men's 
room to avoid media attention and met with the bondsman, who agreed to secure 
the $600,000 bond and documents were filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana 
by 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley paid $60,000, or a 10% deposit, to the bail bondsman, who in turn put 
up the $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Attorney's office acknowledged that prosecutors were satisfied that 
Henley had met the bail requirements needed to guarantee his appearance at 
trial on cocaine conspiracy charges in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has been informed that Darryl Henley has provided $60,000 to a 
bail bondsman who put up a surety bond of $600,000 on Mr. Henley's behalf," 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Deirdre Z. Eliot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley started in place of an injured Steve Israel (tendinitis in left knee) 
in Sunday's 34-19 loss to San Francisco. Although Henley practiced with the 
first string Wednesday, Coach Chuck Knox has yet to name him the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said Israel had an MRI exam on the knee and received an injection, but is 
listed as day to day. MARK PLATTE

BRAWLEY TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS WITH PROPOSED MINOR LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Valley-based Golden State League of Professional Baseball moved a step 
closer to fruition Wednesday when the city of Brawley signed a letter of intent 
to begin detailed negotiations with organizers of the proposed league. 
</P>
<P>
 Brawley, located in the desert east of San Diego, is the second city to sign a 
good-faith letter with the league, which hopes to begin play next summer in six 
Southland cities.Palmdale signed earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden State, designed as an independent minor league with no major-league 
affiliation, plans to build $5.5 million stadiums in each host city. The cities 
are asked to provide 25 acres of land plus infrastructure, such as utility 
hookups. 
</P>
<P>
 The league would own the stadiums, sign the players and operate the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 League President Bob Weinstein, an investment banker from Chatsworth, must 
bring aboard four more cities and produce the $50 million he says the league 
has lined up through investors and advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The financing scheme has to come together," said Tom Fox, executive director 
of the Brawley Economic Development Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said Brawley is considering several possible stadium sites, including some 
that are privately owned. The city is putting together an advisory committee 
composed of city council members and community leaders to analyze the details 
of Weinstein's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are looking good," Weinstein said. "There's breath and air in this 
thing now." 
</P>
<P>
 If the league comes to pass, it would mark only the second time in 40 years 
that the greater San Fernando Valley region has had a minor-league team.

MISERLY SAUGUS, POTENT LOYOLA PLACE 2-0 RECORDS ON THE LINE 
</P>

<P>
 Loyola and Saugus highs, each having won two football games in convincing 
fashion, are ready for a test. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that is how both coaches are approaching tonight's 7 p.m. nonleague 
game between the Cubs (2-0) and Centurions (2-0) at Canyon High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're pretty good," said Jack Bowman, coach of a Saugus team that has 
outscored its opponents, 73-14. "But we'll find out a lot this week. Loyola is 
always a good, well-coached, physical opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola has beaten Fountain Valley, 21-7, and Canyon, 34-7, but Coach Steve 
Grady expects a tougher time tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not played an upper-echelon opponent yet," he said. "Saugus is big, 
strong and bulky, and (its Delaware wingT offense) presents different problems 
for our defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The key matchup, however, will be the Saugus defense against a Loyola offense 
that gained 370 yards against Canyon last week. The Cubs, who prefer to run 
inside, used nine running backs and gained 241 yards on the ground. Leading 
rusher Mike Ellison (13 carries, 114 yards, two touchdowns) played only the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions stuffed Palmdale last week, making 10 tackles behind the line 
of scrimmage and limiting the Falcons to minus-34 yards rushing. Saugus has 
allowed a total of 67 yards rushing and 74 passing and ranks third among area 
Southern Section schools in team defense. Saugus linebacker Matt Gillis has six 
sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In another nonleague contest tonight, Nordhoff and St. Bonaventure are 
scheduled to play a 7:30 at Ventura High.

CHAMINADE STUDENT HAS AIR ABOUT HIM; HIMELSTEIN BROADCASTS PLAY-BY-PLAY OF HIGH 
SCHOOL'S FOOTBALL GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's late in the first half at Chaminade High, and everyone and their 
technical adviser knows why the receiver just dropped that pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "He heard footsteps on that one. He tried to run before he had possession of 
the football."  
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Chaminade, moving left to right on your radio dial, has the opponent 
pinned deep in its own territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's third and a mile. They need to put the ball in the end zone if they want 
to get back in this game."  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Chaminade holds a 28-0 lead as the final seconds tick away. Victory 
is imminent. Or, to put it another way. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The game is in the refrigerator."  
</P>
<P>
 You're listening to 107.1 FM -- "the Chaminade Eagles' radio network" -- where 
cliches come crackling over the airwaves about as often as John Madden bellows 
"Boom!" 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Scott Himelstein, the voice of the Eagles, provides play-by-play while 
sidekick Thom Conrad, a 44-year-old former football coach turned aspiring 
sportscaster, adds color commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the unlikely broadcast team won't account for even a fraction of a 
point in the Arbitron ratings.  
</P>
<P>
 Their low-power signal barely extends beyond the goal posts at Chaminade High. 
And plenty of rough edges still need to be smoothed in production and 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Himelstein, who met Conrad over the summer at a sports-broadcasting camp 
in Irvine, has proved himself a savvy program director by arranging live cameos 
throughout the season by a handful of notable sports broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
 And for listeners, Chaminade's not-so-big broadcast of 1994 is adding spice to 
what so far rates as a superb season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people love it," said Ed Croson, the school's athletic director. "They 
all bring radios and listen. The kid has started something." 
</P>
<P>
 So have the Eagles, who are 2-0 and have outscored opponents, 49-0. Himelstein 
and Conrad, who plan to broadcast every home game this season, have not missed 
a snap. And while they're not exactly cruising on the air with the greatest of 
ease, things are bound to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade is playing El Camino Real, and the pair's headsets are not 
functioning properly. So, they take turns speaking into a hand-held microphone. 
A woman clad in Chaminade colors -- navy blue and orange -- drops by the booth 
to offer encouragement and a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hold the microphone closer to your mouth," she tells Himelstein. "You're 
fading in and out." 
</P>
<P>
 Himelstein gives thanks and takes note. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have heard (the broadcast) say it's really good," Himelstein said. 
"But I know there's still a lot I need to work on, like setting up plays. You 
know, like 'I-formation, slot right. . . .' Stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
 So he's not Pat Summerall. This is, after all, a learning experience. And 
Himelstein, who maintains a 3.5 grade-point average in advanced-placement 
courses at the college preparatory school, characteristically cracks the books 
when it comes to broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends hours preparing for a game, researching the opponent, clipping 
newspaper stories. Two hours before kickoff, he arrives armed with stacks of 
cassette tapes, piles of papers, binoculars and a bulging briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest part is getting all the background information," Himelstein 
said. "Even though there's a lot of information in the newspaper, there's a lot 
more to it than just what's written. Now that we're bringing statistics into 
the broadcast, all that stuff has to be included." 
</P>
<P>
 Himelstein has gained an understanding of the game from Conrad, who lives in 
Fullerton and has worked as an assistant coach at several high schools over the 
past 20 years. But Himelstein's hustle, Conrad says, is what makes the show go. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy doesn't go to sleep," Conrad said. "He's a very hard worker and very 
conscientious. He has all the bases covered." 
</P>
<P>
 Himelstein, also the school's public-address announcer for basketball and 
baseball, spent six months conceiving the program, then convinced the school's 
administration to help fund the project by purchasing an FM transmitter -- "a 
little kit you can buy," Himelstein says -- that cost about $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Himelstein has helped subsidize the project by rounding up local sponsors and 
charging $60 for a pair of 30-second commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kickoff is brought to you by Sid's Seafood House in Canoga Park."  
</P>
<P>
 The broadcast begins with a pregame chat between Conrad and Chaminade Coach 
Rich Lawson and culminates with a postgame interview with the game's star 
player.  
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, Himelstein welcomes a visitor into the booth, usually a fellow 
broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Rory Markas, sports anchor for KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, dropped by 
to discuss the labor disputes surrounding major league baseball and the 
National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 Himelstein's classmates crowded the door while the light of a television 
camera lit up the press box. The interview was broadcast the same evening on 
Markas' 11 p.m. sportscast. 
</P>
<P>
 Himelstein claims to have commitments from Kings' announcer Bob Miller, and 
television sportscasters Fred Roggin of KNBC and Gary Cruz of KCAL. Currently, 
he is courting radio talk-show host Jim Rome of XTRA. 
</P>
<P>
 He met them all at the broadcasting camp, which he first attended in 1993. And 
he has made the most of rubbing shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Himelstein spends free time flipping the dials, studying the methods and 
deliveries of broadcast personalities. He talks rapidly and begins many 
sentences with the words, "In this business. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "In this business," Himelstein said, "it isn't so much what you know as it is 
who you know. You don't need to be aggressive, but you've got to be assertive. 
I remember Jim Rome telling me: 'Never give up.' If you're gonna make it in 
this business, you gotta keep trying."

THEY PROVIDE SOLID FOOTING; KICKING FOR ADJACENT SCHOOLS, FRIENDS ENJOY RIVALRY 
AMID THE PRESSURE OF BEING FEMALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 What makes them kick. What makes them tick. Female high school football 
players, on the next Oprah. 
</P>
<P>
 It's bound to happen. And don't be surprised if the panel includes best 
friends at neighboring schools, Chrissy Sanford of Newbury Park and Joy Barry 
of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford set a Newbury Park record Friday by kicking six extra points. Barry 
was two for two in Thousand Oaks' opener, although the team attempted no kicks 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 By putting their best feet forward, Sanford and Barry are in step with a 
statewide trend. Seventy-one girls suited up for varsity football in 1993, more 
than five times as many as in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In the region alone, Ventura's Natalie Dorr, North Hollywood's Christine 
Hauser and Simi Valley's Tanya Brown-Tuiaana are also helping kick down one of 
the last athletic barriers to girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are not the first female kickers in the region -- Amy Cook 
(Chaminade), Rachel Gagliano (Monroe) and Michele Diana (Cleveland) are recent 
examples of others -- all five are the first at their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorr, a senior, scored 33 points last season but an injury has kept her 
sidelined this year. Hauser, a junior, made one of two conversion kicks last 
week. Brown-Tuiaana, a senior, is a backup kicker and wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Sanford nor Barry, both 16-year-old juniors, was handed her job on a 
tee. The players honed their skills on the junior varsity last year and beat 
out boys for the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she first came out for the team last year, we were like, 'I don't know 
about this,' but Chrissy steps it up for the games," said Eric Mahanke, Newbury 
Park's star wide receiver and linebacker who also makes the center snaps on 
Sanford's kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry also quickly quieted doubters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys made comments but I didn't listen to them," she said. "I've put up 
with their crap for three years. They've come to respect what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford and Barry have a lot in common besides kicking it with the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are among the premier girl soccer players in the state, in fact forging 
their friendship as longtime soccer teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are described by coaches and friends as having exceptional mental 
toughness, enabling them to withstand the pressure every kicker feels. 
</P>
<P>
 And both are highly competitive. Even with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Thousand Oaks played the previous night, Barry was able to watch 
Sanford set the extra point record. After the game, Joy could not be contained, 
rushing to the field and congratulating her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are awesome, a total stud," Barry told Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet driving home, Barry had other thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "As good as she kicked, I'll be wanting to do that too," she said. "There will 
always be that competition between me and Chrissy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks junior varsity defeated Newbury Park, 14-13, last year on 
Barry's extra point. Sanford missed a conversion kick earlier in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was upset with myself that I missed," Sanford said. "I'd pulled a thigh 
muscle in practice and was still trying to kick. I didn't want to be a wimp 
about it, but I had no power. I was totally bummed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford and Barry talk on the phone frequently, exchanging technical advice 
and emotional support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and Joy are like, really good friends," Sanford said. "I don't think what 
we are doing is that special, but no one else can really relate to it the way 
she can." A Little Jealousy 
</P>
<P>
 Jealousy, in fact, is beginning to rear its pony-tailed head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to say it but Chrissy is getting a little big-headed," said a Newbury 
Park classmate of Sanford. "I don't really blame her, she got so much attention 
at school Monday after setting the record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some other girls could have been the kicker. I wish I would have done 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also harboring resentment are boys confused about why the kicker -- regardless 
of gender -- is getting more acclaim than full-time players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out there working our butts off every day and she got all this 
attention," said a former Ventura player who was a teammate of Dorr's last 
year. "I guess I could understand the reason, but it didn't seem fair. Kickers 
aren't really athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorr would beg to differ: Like Sanford and Barry, she is an exceptional soccer 
player. And all three are playing soccer concurrently with football. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry recently made the Olympic Development western regional team and will 
travel to Florida to play the Southern Regional squad during the Thanksgiving 
holiday. She also plays for the Las Virgenes Blazers, a team for women 19 and 
under. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford is a member of the Olympic Development state team and also plays for 
the Conejo Valley United Rockettes, a team of 16-year-olds coached by her 
father, Guy Sanford. She also is a varsity swimmer and high jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been playing soccer for 10 years, and kicking a football is the same 
form and technique," said Sanford, who says she kicks equally well with either 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she sought an expert to help her improve. Sanford is taking kicking 
lessons from Cal Lutheran assistant coach Eric Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected that a female could kick maybe 20 yards," Davis said. "She came 
right out and booted one 40 yards. I said, 'Good Lord.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford made a similar impression on Newbury Park coaches last year during a 
tryout. She had never kicked a football before, yet after 15 minutes of 
kicking, she was issued pads and a uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry, who had kicked for the freshman team in 1992, encouraged Sanford to 
try. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me how much fun it was, that all you have to do is kick the ball and 
stuff," Sanford said. "I figured that if she could do it, I could too." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry, a left-footed kicker, took up freshman Coach Chuck Brown's offer of a 
tryout by practicing for two days with her father, then showing up for 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Brown harbored no prejudices about girls being unable to 
compete: He has coached numerous female Lancer basketball and softball players 
who went on to Division I colleges, including Marion Jones (basketball, North 
Carolina), Amy Chellevold (softball, Arizona) and Michelle Palmisano 
(basketball, UCLA). 
</P>
<P>
 "Joy is a very mentally tough person, and once I saw that it didn't bother her 
to have all these guys crashing in around her, I knew she could do this," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry and Sanford have proven they can kick well under pressure, yet both 
freely admit to nervousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first varsity kick, oh my God, I was so scared," Barry said. "If I missed 
it, people would say, 'Oh God, she's so bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Boom, the kick split the uprights, as they say on TV. Her second kick hooked 
slightly right, but was good. Popularity Soars 
</P>
<P>
 As their kicks have risen over the crossbar, their acceptance by teammates has 
skyrocketed. "The guys on the team totally like her," said Meredith Disney, a 
friend of Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Barry has been playing for three years, she has become one of the 
guys, in a sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most guys have learned to respect it," Barry said. "They say, 'Wow, a girl 
playing football, that's cool.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The only concession to Barry's gender is that on the Thousand Oaks roster her 
weight is listed as question marks. For the record, Barry is 5-foot-4, 105 
pounds; Sanford is 5-6, 125. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair have toppled another barrier as well, engaging in something 
unheard-of in high school football: practicing with rival players. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry visited Newbury Park this week and last year Sanford traveled to 
Thousand Oaks to join Barry in a tee party. 
</P>
<P>
 Both girls make kicks beyond 40 yards in practice and are anxious to try a 
field goal. They have competition, however. Senior Andy Carpiac at Thousand 
Oaks and junior Brant Diediker at Newbury Park, who their coaches believe have 
stronger legs than the girls, will attempt long kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, the Cal Lutheran kicking coach, said Sanford is ready to increase her 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has 40 yards in her easy, 45 maybe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry might have to wait until next season to attempt a long field goal. But 
she will have competition from the Lancers' current junior varsity kicker. 
</P>
<P>
 The name? Meet Nicole Straky.

THE COLLEGES / IRENE GARCIA; PIERCE TENNIS COURTS NOT EXACTLY ALL THEY ARE 
CRACKED UP TO BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How would you like to play tennis on a court that has deep cracks, some so bad 
that chunks of concrete are missing from the surface? 
</P>
<P>
 You try to run down a ball and your foot gets caught. Ankle sprain. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ball hits a crack, it can do all sorts of weird things. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Pierce College tennis Coach Aris Hovsepian). The men's team practices 
on the school's warped courts three hours a day.  
</P>
<P>
 Hovsepian said many of the 13 courts had bearable hairline cracks before the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. The tremor's powerful jolt, however, caused severe damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The old cracks are now huge and deep, and there's an array of new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players hate the fact that they have to practice on these courts," Hovsepian 
said. "Every time they get on the court they're gambling with their safety. 
Every time, I pray. Before practice I pray nothing happens to anybody and 
afterward I thank God nothing happened." 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been some casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Goodley, who played No. 5 singles last season, suffered a twisted ankle 
when his foot hit a crack during practice. He was sidelined for about two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 During a team workout about six months ago, Hovsepian's foot got caught in a 
rift as he chased a ball. He fell hard and injured his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain is still there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They are relatively minor incidents, but there is potential for more serious 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The tennis team is not the only one to be affected by the earthquake. The 
school's two gyms were also condemned, inconveniencing athletes who practice 
and compete in them. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's volleyball team is practicing at Taft High, and the men's team is 
conducting preseason workouts at the Balboa Park Recreation Center gym. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pierce gyms are expected to be fixed by the beginning of next year. 
The bill should amount to about $1 million, according to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The tennis courts, however, will remain in their pathetic condition. The 
school has made no commitment to repair them.  
</P>
<P>
 One school official claimed earlier this week that the courts' "superficial" 
cracks are not related to the earthquake and instead are a result of natural 
wear and tear. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know they have been like that for a long time," said Bob Garber, 
dean of student affairs. "The earthquake didn't really hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce Athletic Director Marian McWilliams, a former women's tennis coach, has 
no idea when or if the courts will be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 She did admit that something should be done, though it's not a pressing issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not in good shape," she said. "But they're still being used." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, Hovsepian says, is, well, the bottom line. No one wants to 
pay for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials asked him to get several estimates and the best he could find 
was $2,000 a court. All 13 need repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovsepian said officials have yet to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haven't heard a thing," he said. "I really don't know what is going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, all he can do is dodge cracks and pray. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we host a match, the first thing we do is apologize before welcoming our 
opponent," Hovsepian said. "All of them are very surprised we have such a good 
program and park level facilities. This team practices on some of the worst 
courts in California." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite poor training facilities, Pierce in 1993 continued its tradition as 
one of the country's top junior college programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas had a 22-2 record and placed second in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovsepian says at least 10 coaches have phoned him inquiring about his team, 
which begins play in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ask 'Who do you have this year? What does your team look like?' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovsepian played a joke on the curious coaches. He had a photo taken of his 
players with their backs to the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of the group is a smiling Hovsepian facing the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent a photo to all of them," Hovsepian said with a chuckle. "Let them 
wonder."

WITH BAR LIFTED, JOHNSON NATURALLY TAKES SHOT; WOMEN'S POLE VAULT: FORMER 
OLYMPIC GYMNAST EAGER TO TRY A SPORT STILL IN ITS INFANCY AT THE INTERNATIONAL 
LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pole-vaulters are often referred to as the gymnasts of track and field, so 
perhaps it is natural for a former world-class gymnast to participate in a 
learn-by-doing clinic at a pole-vaulting competition Saturday at Verdugo Park 
in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Johnson, the 1984 Olympic bronze medalist in the balance beam and a 
Burbank resident, will vault for the first time at the clinic that follows the 
men's invitational competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 35, retired from gymnastics after the 1984 Games, but became 
interested in the pole vault last summer while in St. Petersburg, Russia, to 
announce the gymnastics portion of the Goodwill Games for ABC television. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was at the stadium with broadcasting colleagues Dwight Stones and 
Craig Masback when she realized that the athletes participating in the 
pole-vault competition that day were women, not men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. I don't believe this,' " Johnson said. " 
'I'd like to at least try this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although the women's pole vault is in its infant stages at the international 
level -- the world record is 13-5 3/4 -- it's not entirely foreign to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 She watched her brother, Mike, compete for UCLA in the mid-1980s and always 
figured that a background in gymnastics could increase a vaulter's chance for 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 She will test that theory first-hand Saturday as event organizer Brooks Morris 
-- a former standout at Burroughs High -- will give interested individuals a 
chance to try pole-vaulting  
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-1 1/2, 104-pound Johnson has stayed in excellent shape since 
retiring and is looking forward to a new athletic challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure how serious I'm going to get about (the pole vault)," she said. 
"I think it depends on how it goes. I have nothing to base it on since I've 
never done it before, but I want to give it a try. . . . If I fall in love with 
it, I'll have to see how much time I'm willing to devote to it." 
</P>
<P>
 John Besmer, a former standout at Cal State Chico, leads the list of entrants 
in the invitational portion of the meet. Besmer has a personal best of 18 feet 
1 inch. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top entries are Scott Slover (17-1 personal best) of UCLA; Morris 
(16-11); Dan Tapia (16-7) of Cal State Los Angeles, and Borya Orloff (16-6) of 
UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Slover and Orloff finished 1-2 in the State high school championships in June 
while competing for San Jose Leland and St. John Bosco. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school, open and masters' portion of the meet will start at 8 a.m. 
followed by the women's/girls' competition at 11 and the men's invitational 
event at 1:30.

XANTHOS NAMED COACH OF THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former North Hollywood High and Pierce College tennis Coach Paul Xanthos was 
named coach of the year Wednesday by the United States Professional Tennis 
Assn. at its national convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Xanthos, 73, who compiled a 548-103 record and won conference championships in 
23 of 29 seasons at Pierce, has spent much of his career teaching the sport to 
players and other coaches worldwide. Earlier this year, the Woodland Hills 
resident was the first junior college coach inducted into the NCAA Collegiate

GOING TO 'SOUTH PACIFIC,' AGAIN; RIGHT NOW YOU CAN SEE THE STAGE MUSICAL IN 
TUSTIN AND BREA; IT JUST CLOSED IN YORBA LINDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "South Pacific," the lovely and 
mysterious island of Bali H'ai beckons from across the misty ocean. "If you 
try, you'll find her," croons Bloody Mary, "where the sky meets the sea." 
</P>
<P>
 You never have to try too hard to find Bali H'ai in Orange County, though. 
This season alone, from where the 55 freeway meets the 5 to right off Imperial 
Highway, productions of "South Pacific" are running in Tustin and Brea, 
practically next to each other. A third, in nearby Yorba Linda, closed just 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia DeLand, producer for the Yorba Linda Civic Light Opera where the show 
opened in July, remarked that "people who have theaters in such close proximity 
should pay a little more attention" to what each other is doing. Yet she 
confessed that her troupe had known nothing of the other productions. "South 
Pacific," she said, was "high on the ballot from our audience." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Brea Civic Light Opera, where it debuted last weekend, president Harold 
Ivy said the musical "topped the list" of possible shows drawn in January by 
the 12-member executive board. Was the board surprised to learn that other 
companies would be offering the same thing so close by? "'Upset' is a better 
word," Ivy allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over in Tustin at the Elizabeth Howard Curtain Call Dinner Theatre, "South 
Pacific" had been playing for more than two months before the lights ever came 
up on Brea's tropical paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Curtain Call's executive staff -- led by producer Howard and her brother, 
John Ferola, who is the artistic director -- choose from a stable of 20 to 30 
musicals and run them as long as they seem to draw an audience ("South Pacific" 
is scheduled to close Oct. 23). "South Pacific" has been a recurring stalwart, 
having occupied their stage four times in the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't do (shows) for a few years and then they come around again," said 
Doug Shaffer, the Curtain Call's musical director. Like DeLand and Ivy, Shaffer 
said he, Howard and Ferola had been unaware of the other productions, but he 
insisted that the dinner theater offers a unique product that doesn't 
necessarily compete with community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, this isn't the only season that has seen the show "come around 
again" with amazing regularity. Not even counting the Howard productions, it 
has been mounted six times in Orange County since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of its appeal certainly is in its beautiful ballads ("Some Enchanted 
Evening," "Younger Than Springtime") and rousing showstoppers ("There is 
Nothin' Like a Dame," "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair") and in its 
counterpointed love stories, one between career-woman Ensign Nellie Forbush and 
sophisticated, wealthy Frenchman Emile de Becque, and the other between young 
hotshot hero Joe Cable and angelic native-girl Liat. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's the sailors who can really sell the show. An irresistible 
hodgepodge of Americans who pant after dames, and who exercise their Yankee 
ingenuity to get around regulations and make a half-honest buck on the side, 
they seemingly never fail to charm. Indeed, in spite of the competition, all 
three of this season's "South Pacifics" have pulled audiences in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our pre-sale has been very good," Ivy said of Brea's production, which 
continues through Oct. 9. "We expect this to be our best show to date." 
Elizabeth Howard's production is apparently having a healthy run, doing its 
part to keep the county's last surviving dinner theater in business. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps even "South Pacific" can play out its appeal. Yorba Linda's 
production, which sold out several times, was scheduled for six more 
performances at the 2,000 seat amphitheater in Anaheim's Pearson Park. But 
those shows were canceled. Out of a possible 12,000 tickets, only 10 had been 
pre-sold. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Richmond of the Anaheim Recreation Department, which books the park, said 
she really doesn't know why the sales were so dismal, whether it was "the show, 
the circumstances, the timing or what. Normally, we do concerts and children's 
shows. We had 1,600 people for a magic show this summer." With such a large 
house, she noted, "it looks pretty scary when only 30 people show up." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal between the YLCLO and the city of Anaheim was the first of its kind 
and Richmond speculated that the city would "probably try a similar arrangement 
again. Basically, we did it to get some people in because we have experienced a 
drop in grant funding. We did it so that people would notice that the 
amphitheater is here and that there are other things going on." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news on the cancellation? Some of the Yorba Linda cast members hopped 
right over to Brea's production. For some people, Bali H'ai is always calling. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Brea Civic Light Opera production of "South Pacific" by Rodgers and 
Hammerstein continues through Oct. 9 at the Curtis Theater, 1 Civic Center 
Circle, Brea, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Saturdays and Sundays 
at 2 p.m. $7 to $15. (714) 990-7722. The Elizabeth Howard Curtain Call Dinner 
Theatre production continues through Oct. 23 at 690 El Camino Real, Tustin, 
Tuesdays through Saturdays at 6:15 p.m. and Sundays at 11:15 a.m. and 5:15 p.m. 
$20.95 to $31.95, includes meal. (714) 838-1540.

<P>
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture requires that all packages of raw meats 
carry safe handling instructions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also issued food safety 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal guidelines include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Select dairy products, raw meat, poultry, eggs and seafood last when grocery 
shopping. Go directly home after food shopping and store perishables in the 
refrigerator or freezer immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep raw meats and poultry separate from all other foods during shopping, 
refrigerated storage and preparation. Otherwise, bacteria that may be present 
in the raw meat, poultry or seafood might contaminate a cooked or ready-to-eat 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep raw meats and poultry refrigerated or frozen. Thaw frozen food only in 
the refrigerator or microwave. Do not thaw foods at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wash all surfaces that come in contact with raw meats and poultry with hot 
water and soap. Among those items of particular concern are cutting boards, 
utensils, hands, sink basins, refrigerator shelves or drawers, dish towels and 
aprons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep aprons, kitchen towels, cloths and sponges clean. Do not reuse dish 
cloths or sponges that have been used to clean meat or poultry juices without 
thoroughly washing. Replace sponges frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 * If marinating raw meat, poultry or seafood, keep the dish stored in the 
refrigerator and never on the kitchen counter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cook raw meats and poultry thoroughly. Ground meats, in particular, should 
be cooked until the interior is no longer pink -- between 155 degrees and 160 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once cooked, serve hot foods hot -- above 140 degrees. Once prepared, keep 
cold foods cold -- below 40 degrees. Do not let cold foods stand at room 
temperature for more than one hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refrigerate leftover meats immediately or discard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Call the USDA's Meat and Poultry Hotline with any questions about food 
safety or product wholesomeness. The toll free number is (800) 535-4555. DANIEL

THE HAMBURGER TRAIL; NOT SO ROUND, NOT SO FIRM, NOT SO FULLY PACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A good hamburger is a simple and glorious thing: well browned and crusty on 
the outside, soft and juicy-to-bursting within. And yet, if the pleasures of 
hamburgers are so simple, why are they so difficult to cook?  
</P>
<P>
 Why is it that hand-made, home-cooked burgers are well done before they get 
that great crust? Why does the juice flow out of the burger and into the pan, 
so that what winds up in the bun is as flavorless and dry as a potholder? Why 
does all the good stuff drip out onto the charcoal in a back-yard grill, 
causing countless flare-ups and leaving shrunken, charred meat cakes as mealy 
and interesting as bricks? 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is the quality of the meat you start with," says 
chef Bill Bracken, who serves a great hamburger poolside at the Peninsula Hotel 
in Beverly Hills. "We get really good meat -- Angus beef -- and have it ground 
specially." 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula hamburgers have a 15% fat content. The eight-ounce patties are 
formed and then "cryo-packed" in airtight packages and kept very cold until 
cooked on the restaurant's open broiler. Just before cooking, patties are 
lightly dusted with Bracken's own seasoning mix, which contains "a little of 
everything": fresh pepper, salt, cayenne, onion powder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Peel's hamburgers at Campanile have more meat flavor than most. He uses 
good, fresh chuck and grinds it himself -- twice, coarsely. The ideal fat 
content, he says, is 22%, "not taking into consideration health factors." (Most 
of us grew up eating hamburger meat that was around 33% fat.) The trick, says 
Peel, is to keep the meat really cold while grinding so that meat and fat are 
actually cut and not just "smeared." 
</P>
<P>
 He then very gently forms the ground meat into a loosely packed, six-ounce 
ball-like patty. No squeezing is allowed: the less the meat is handled, the 
better it is. At the restaurant, Peel tucks about a half-ounce of Gorgonzola 
cheese in the middle of each patty and salts the meat lightly on both sides 
before putting it on the mesquite grill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a while to cook, because it's loosely packed and not skinny," says 
Peel. "I like them crusty on the outside and rare on the inside, which means 
cooking them about 10 minutes, with one flip." 
</P>
<P>
 Home cooks, however, do not have access to powerful open broilers or mesquite 
grills, let alone prime Angus beef. Instead, most of us supermarket shoppers 
face a cold case with a confusing assortment of packaged ground beef ranging 
from extra lean, 7% fat, to 25% fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, hamburger needs to be lightly handled. In order for a burger to be juicy, 
there need to be air pockets in the meat where, during cooking, juices can 
accumulate -- otherwise, the juices all run out into the pan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But before reaching the cold case, the average packaged hamburger has been 
ground coarsely, mixed in a machine, ground again (more finely this time), then 
packed into trays, sealed, labeled and put on display, often in stacks two or 
three packages deep. At this point, commercially ground beef may already have 
had all the handling it can take. At the very least, it's necessary to treat 
packaged hamburger meat extremely gently, using fingertips only -- never the 
palms -- to form patties. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher shops and meat counters give the consumer more options. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave De Rosa at Marconda's Meat at the Farmers Market says good hamburgers 
start with good meat. Choice or Prime meat are the best, because these grades 
have more fat in them. And even if they're trimmed a little closer, these 
grades still have more flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Different parts of the whole beef are better when ground: In general, the 
lower down on the animal, the better the flavor. The lower part of the leg, the 
shank, is better than the upper part of the leg or the rump because there's 
more muscle lower and, therefore, more flavor. Also, the chuck and the front of 
the animal are quite tasty. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the best meat for grinding is rarely the easiest to grind: 
Before the meat can be ground, all gristle, tendon and sinew must be removed, 
or the cooked burger will be stringy, tough or gristly. The heel of the round, 
the shank and the chuck that's closest to the neck all have excellent flavor, 
but they require a certain amount of prep work with a sharp knife -- you'd have 
to have the patience of Job to trim a shank. 
</P>
<P>
 Butchers, says De Rosa, like sirloin because it's the easiest and the quickest 
to grind: There's not much gristle, and sirloin is the leanest and the 
best-looking (although the flavor can't compare with good ground chuck). 
</P>
<P>
 After a full day of flipping burgers in The Times Test Kitchen and an evening 
at the barbecue grill, we can add a few more hints: 
</P>
<P>
 * The higher the fat content, the juicier and tastier the burger. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ground beef bought loose and wrapped by the butcher is usually superior to 
packaged beef. Not only has it been handled less, it often tastes fresher. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beef (preferably chuck steak) ground to order by the butcher is even better 
than the loose ground beef in the butcher case. Have the meat ground coarsely, 
twice, as for "chili" beef. (Finely ground beef has fewer of those precious air 
pockets.) A well-trimmed boneless chuck roast, ground with all its attached 
fat, yields ground beef with about a 12% fat content. (If the butcher doesn't 
have any fat on hand to add, don't be dismayed. This still makes an excellent 
burger.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Beef ground at home (twice, coarsely) is superior even to butcher-ground 
beef: It's fresher, you can take the time to remove all the membranes and 
gristle and you can adjust the fat content to your own specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 * While both sirloin and chuck ground at home produce good, juicy burgers, 
chuck, with either 15% or 22% fat content, makes by far the tastiest burger. 
Chuck with 7% fat, while not as moist, is still pretty darn flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
 * During and after grinding, it is absolutely crucial to handle the beef as 
little as possible. Mix and form, using only your fingertips. Pressed or 
well-patted patties, while smoother and rounder, turn into dry, dense meat 
bricks. Better to have your uncooked patties a bit "bristly-looking," at least 
an inch thick, and not perfectly round. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remember to keep the meat as cold as possible during grinding and handling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frying in a hot pan over medium to medium-high heat produces the best 
home-cooked burger. The meat (even that with a 7% fat content) sputters in its 
own melted fat to create the desired crust. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pan-grilling and barbecuing outdoors create pretty grill marks and somewhat 
juicy burgers, but grilled burgers lack the crust and all-out juiciness of 
frying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Broiling under the average home broiler is the least satisfactory cooking 
method; not only is there no crust on a broiled burger, much of the juice runs 
out to the bottom of the pan. Even the best meat cooked under the broiler can 
acquire a "sweated," "liverish," "boiled" taste.  
</P>
<P>
 * Hands off! No matter what method of cooking is used, never poke, prod or, 
worst of all, press on the burger while cooking. One flip should be sufficient. 
 
</P>
<P>
 * The ideal four-ounce hamburger should be approximately three inches in 
diameter and one inch thick. For a juicy, medium-rare burger, cook 
approximately 4 1/2 minutes on each side on medium-high heat. For medium-well 
to well, cook 5 1/2 to 6 minutes on each side. 
</P>
<P>
 * The best burger? Chuck steak, ground at home (twice, coarsely) with a 15% to 
22% fat content, very gently formed, lightly salted, and fried in a hot pan 
over medium to medium-high heat.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: GROAT EXPECTATION

<TEXT>
<P>
 The best cowboy breakfasts may be an hour away out toward Pearblossom, and the 
best place for dim sum seems to change every week, but everybody seems to know 
the best regular-guy breakfast place on the Westside, which is why on weekend 
mornings at John O'Groats the line spills out onto the pavement, fills the 
benches and even wanders over to check out the par-3 course at Rancho Park just 
down the block. Fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, sourdough French toast with a 
side of Vermont syrup, crunchy pecan waffles: John O'Groats has it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The place is sort of genteel, really -- patterned blue wallpaper like the kind 
your grandmother used to have, a mounted fish over the coffee machine, a 
splendid waitress named Angelica who has been asking, "Biscuits or toast?" 
since the restaurant opened more than 10 years ago. The U-shaped counter seems 
equally at home occupied by country-club women in tennis dresses and grotty 
UCLA film majors who look as if they haven't slept in a week . . . or even by 
hamburger-ordering Sikhs. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a town called John o'Groat's at the northernmost point in Scotland, a 
cod's toss from the Orkneys, but the menu here is pretty much all-American -- 
no finnan haddie or haggis or anything like that, just bacon and eggs, fried 
ham and eggs, spicy turkey sausage and eggs, wonderful asparagus omelets. Also, 
there seem to be no actual groats around, which is kind of a relief, though 
there is something called Huevos O'Groats that I've never been brave enough to 
try. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there are buckwheat pancakes dotted with fresh blueberries or with 
pecans, bowls of ripe bananas in heavy cream, and great servings of oatmeal -- 
the imported steel-cut kind, served with cream and fruit and sugar. Egg dishes 
come with crisp home-fried potatoes. Fat, smoked pork chops are ruddy to the 
bone, intensely smoky, salty as prosciutto; eggs Benedict, very fine, are made 
with profoundly smoky ham and a lemony hollandaise. 
</P>
<P>
 But essentially, everybody comes for the buttermilk biscuits. High, vaguely 
beehive-shaped things, light and soft with a crunchy exterior, they easily 
split into four or five warm layers. They do have a slight, bitterish tang of 
baking soda that some people consider a fault, but it brings out the essential 
sweetness of the biscuits themselves -- if you don't pile on too much 
marmalade. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a very nice version of fish and chips -- moist, a little chewy, 
with a shatteringly crisp fried crust -- the lunchtime stuff here tends to be 
one sort of brawny dad food or another: sloppy patty melts made with two-inch 
slabs of meat; quesadillas stuffed with everything you might conceivably put 
into an omelet; manly Cobb salads that contain giant amounts of the 
restaurant's unusually good smoked ham and are served with sides of strange, 
thick poppy-seed dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, breakfast is served all day.

HOME COOK: THE WALLFLOWER OF THE ROOT WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM

<TEXT>
<P>
 Celeriac is one of the most overlooked vegetables. Also known as celery root 
(it's not the root of ordinary celery, but of a variety grown especially for 
the root), it is certainly ugly. But the French have always appreciated its 
virtues, and for years all good French restaurants had celery root remoulade on 
the hors d'oeuvre platter. Probably, they still do. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a favorite casserole of root vegetables, suitable either as a main 
course or as a side dish with roasted meat. Celeriac is what makes it work. 
Once or twice I have left the celery root out, and the other vegetables tasted 
bland.  
</P>
<P>
 You can make another wonderful dish by peeling and slicing potatoes and celery 
root, layering the slices in a baking dish, adding seasonings to taste, dotting 
with butter and adding enough water or chicken broth to barely cover. Then bake 
at 350 degrees for 45 to 55 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A perfect dessert to serve with thrifty root vegetables (or cellar vegetables, 
as they were once called when almost everyone had a cool cellar for storing 
vegetables during the winter) is Ohio lemon pie. It's another gift from the 
early American Shakers, who created wonderful dishes from the plainest 
ingredients. The filling is nothing more than lemons, sugar and eggs 
transformed into a triumph of ingenuity.  
</P>
<P>
 The secret to making this pie is to cut the lemon paper-thin, mix the slices 
with sugar and let them stand at least five to six hours. Additional sugar 
should be sprinkled over the lemon slices when arranging in the pie shell -- it 
will make the pie juicy. CELERIAC AND ROOT VEGETABLES

<P>
 Come September, after a summer of outdoor entertaining, we begin to focus more 
on the indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 For this first early fall dinner, I like a menu that is still fairly light but 
robustly flavored. Consider lemony, herbed roast chicken (it can also be 
grilled) accompanied by a medley of garlic-roasted vegetables -- small red 
potatoes, red and yellow peppers and a last-minute addition of broccoli 
florets. For dessert, a delectable caramel-pecan-apple crisp, served warm with 
a dollop of vanilla or butter-pecan ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To flatten the chicken for this recipe, split it down the backbone (easy 
enough to do with kitchen shears) and then flatten by pressing firmly on the 
breast with the palm of your hand. The chicken will cook a little more quickly 
and evenly when flattened, will also absorb the marinade more effectively and 
is easier to cut into serving portions.  
</P>
<P>
 LEMONY HERBED CHICKEN 
</P>
<P>
 1 (3- to 4-pound) chicken, split down back, rinsed, patted dry, flattened 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon light soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon snipped chives 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon rosemary 
</P>
<P>
 Scant 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Snipped chives 
</P>
<P>
 Lemon wedges 
</P>
<P>
 Combine chicken, garlic, mustard, lemon juice, olive oil, soy sauce, chives, 
basil, rosemary, salt and pepper to taste in large plastic food bag. Secure bag 
and shake well so marinade coats chicken. Refrigerate 2 to 3 hours, or as long 
as overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove chicken from marinade. Reserve marinade for basting. Place chicken 
skin-side up on shallow baking pan lined with heavy foil. Season lightly to 
taste with salt and pepper.  
</P>
<P>
 Roast on upper oven rack at 425 degrees, brushing often with marinade after 
first 20 minutes. Roast until chicken is sizzling, deeply browned and juices 
run clear when pierced with knife at joint of drumstick and thigh, about 45 
minutes. Serve hot or warm. Garnish with chives and lemon wedges. Makes 4 
servings.

 Consider yourself forewarned with this recipe. A good exhaust fan helps 
dissipate the garlic aroma as these vegetables cook. GARLIC-ROASTED BROCCOLI, 
POTATOES AND SWEET PEPPERS 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups broccoli florets 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 12 small red potatoes, rinsed, dried, halved 
</P>
<P>
 1 sweet red pepper, cored, cut into 1 1/4-inch squares 
</P>
<P>
 1 sweet yellow pepper, cored, cut into 1-1/4-inch squares 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 In skillet heat olive oil and garlic just until garlic begins to sizzle. Do 
not let garlic brown. Strain and reserve oil, discarding garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl sprinkle broccoli with 2 teaspoons oil. Toss to mix well. Sprinkle 
with dash sea salt. Toss again. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine red pepper flakes, potatoes and sweet red and yellow peppers in mixing 
bowl. Sprinkle with remaining oil. Toss well, making sure potatoes and peppers 
are evenly coated with oil. Spread vegetables on jelly roll pan. (Do not line 
pan with foil as vegetables will not brown as well.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 425 degrees on lower oven rack (if roasting chicken at same time, use 
rack just below chicken), tossing after 20 minutes, until potatoes begin to 
turn golden brown, about 30 minutes. Add broccoli and cook 5 to 7 minutes more 
until broccoli is cooked and turns bright green. Serve hot or warm. Makes 6 
servings.

</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup light-brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup frozen unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped pecans 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla or butter-pecan ice cream

GARDEN FRESH; FLORENCE FENNEL: THE CULTIVATED BULB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Probably the most romantic way to appreciate sweet, licorice-tasting fennel is 
to gather it wild from cliffs overlooking the English Channel, or the 
Mediterranean, or our own rocky coasts, then stuff fish pulled from those 
waters with the fennel's chopped feathery leaves, grill them over fragrant 
fennel branches, then serve the fish sprinkled with plump fennel seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild fennel, common fennel, is magnificent -- airy plumes of rich green leaves 
can grow five feet tall. This is the fennel that gives us abundant leaves and 
aromatic seeds for cooking. It's gorgeous at the back of a mixed border. 
However, the stalks at the base of common fennel, which wrap around one another 
to form a bulb, are tough and the bulb itself is skimpy. Common fennel is 
regarded as a seasoning herb. 
</P>
<P>
 For a vegetable, Mother Nature gave us Florence fennel. These plants may not 
grow wild on chalky cliffs, or provide delicious seeds; they may grow less than 
half as tall as their dramatic cousins. But Florence is the fennel with a plump 
snowy bulb of delicious stalks. The stalks at the base are flat as celery, 
their upper stems hollow. The bulb perches atop the ground and the plant is 
charming in the middle of the border wreathed in cosmos, whose foliage matches 
its featheriness. Florence is the fennel bulb that adds exotic sweetness to 
salads, soups and other vegetables, and it complements every fish and seafood 
you ever heard of. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are more members of the fennel family, and it's good to know them, 
otherwise you may send for seeds and find yourself growing a fennel different 
from the one you had in mind. Sweet fennel is close to common -- has no bulb to 
speak of but is endowed with large fragrant seeds. Bronze fennel is a form of 
common fennel with an unusual color -- the leaves all but disappear in 
afternoon sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 No good giving you the botanical name for these fennels, since I find most 
seedsmen and gardening books confuse them. The best thing is to order from a 
seedsman with seed sense and knowledge. Around here, seeds can be sown in place 
from early spring through late summer. Mark your new calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 The fennel plant is a perennial. Normally, it grows to just this side of 
adulthood the first year, then the second year it matures and flowers. But 
Florence fennel can be temperamental. If it isn't happy with its circumstances, 
it will flower even without bothering to form a bulb; this makes every part but 
the flowers and leaves inedible. 
</P>
<P>
 While sweet, common and bronze fennels are drought-tolerant and can thrive on 
poor soil, prima donna Florence wants fertile moist soil. If your summers are 
terribly hot, give Florence fennel shade in the middle of the day. The cultivar 
Zefa Fino was developed by Swiss breeders not to flower prematurely. Should 
flower stalks appear anyway, nip them out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't a place in the garden, Florence fennel is handsome in a 
container. Give it a stately five- to six-gallon pot and border with a couple 
of Alaska nasturtiums. These are the nasties with bright 
green-marbled-with-cream leaves and vibrant flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Florence fennel has an almost exotic flavor in its licorishness. It's 
wonderful as part of an hors d'oeuvres selection: Cut bulbs lengthwise into 
slender hunks as you do celery, letting the core hold a number of pieces 
together. Serve with a pot of coarse salt on the side. Or offer a shallow dish 
of pinzimonio -- splendid Italian name for your finest olive oil seasoned with 
a speck of salt and freshly ground black pepper, meant as a dip for raw 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Fennel seeds have a smokier character than the flavor of Florence's bulb. From 
the seacliff or from the common or sweet fennel in your garden, you'll harvest 
seeds when they start turning brown. Cut the clusters off the branches and 
spread them on a cloth to dry in a warm, dark, dry place. It will take a couple 
of weeks. Rub the seeds off the stems and turn them into a dark glass jar. 
Cover airtight and store with other dried condiments in a cool, dark, dry 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Fennel seeds make bread special. Try mixing a tablespoon into your favorite 
dough. Or brushing commercial French or Italian bread with beaten egg, 
sprinkling over fennel seeds, and baking until the egg sets and the seeds are 
stuck in place. Fennel seeds are what gives fresh Italian sausage its zing. 
Fennel seeds don't roast until they pop, the way caraways do. To bring out 
their flavor, you can toast them in a dry skillet, but only for a couple of 
minutes, or they'll turn bitter. Sources:

 The inspiration for this soup came from my favorite onion soup, which came 
from a friend in Paris. It's easy to put together, and the trick is to have it 
warming in the oven when guests arrive. Their noses will lift and they'll ask, 
"What is that?" It's the sort of soup that can be the meal for good friends, or 
a sophisticated first course for an important dinner party.  
</P>
<P>
 The liqueur Pernod is clear and greeny yellow, the color of fennel's blossoms. 
Anise-flavored, it gives a dish with fennel delicious depth -- and a splash 
stands in for fresh fennel in all sorts of Mediterranean compositions. Imported 
from France, Pernod is costly, but it keeps indefinitely at room temperature. 
You can buy it at some liquor stores in "airplane size," which is the right 
amount for this soup.  
</P>
<P>
 For an easy cold - weather come-for-soup invitation, complete the meal with 
bowls of baby carrots, Kalamata olives, a salad of cooked, dried white beans 
(cannellini if you can find them, or small limas) dressed with olive oil and 
fresh lemon juice, a plate of paper - thin slices of pepperoni or other 
not-too-spicy dried sausage, and a basket of bread sticks -- these for spooning 
onto a side dish. Drink a red Cote de Rhone wine, and for dessert, crisp iced 
apples of the season and Brie.  
</P>
<P>
 This can be prepared a day or two in advance and refrigerated, then warmed in 
a low oven.  
</P>
<P>

 A bottleneck of cars jockeying for position in the parking lot at Marukai 
Discount Japanese Food Mart is the only sign of life on this desolate stretch 
of Vermont Avenue in Gardena. Tucked between an empty phone switching station 
and the flashy El Dorado gambling casino, Marukai sells bonsai gardening tools, 
wind chimes, fresh soba noodles, beautiful sashimi trays, instant matsutake 
mushroom soup, hand-carved wooden rice bowls, red-bean flavored ice cream bars 
and rubber Japanese garden slippers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not fancy here. The aisles are tight and the floor is concrete. But 
shelves are packed with a treasure trove of edible discoveries -- many of them 
selected and imported directly from Japan by Marukai Inc. You'll see the 
Marukai brand name on several styles of green tea, bamboo shoot tips and 
tempura mix, among other things.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooks who use Japanese ingredients, whether for authentic dishes or fusion 
cooking, love Marukai for its serendipitous selection of unusual brands. The 
store is well organized, but there are always a few randomly placed boxes of 
Japanese mayonnaise in squeezable plastic bottles or bubble gum wrapped with 
Japanese cartoon characters. A tiny Seiko watch department sits next to rare 
brandies and futons opposite the Japanese pharmacy items. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea for Marukai grew out of necessity," says Art Noda, a close associate 
of Marukai owner Hidejiro Matsu. Marukai Inc. started out as a distributor of 
Japanese giftware, with locations in New York, Cerritos and Northern 
California. But the economic downturn of the late '70s put these novelties at 
the bottom of shoppers' lists.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Matsu, who was already well connected in the Japanese wholesale food business 
in Hawaii and Osaka (where his family had a food distribution company), 
reasoned correctly that a discount membership grocery and housewares store 
would fit the revised spending habits of local Japanese consumers. So in 1982 
Matsu opened Marukai on 166th Street across from the Gardena Buddhist Church. 
Patrons paid a $4 membership fee and were sent a monthly newsletter offering 
special deals on Japanese merchandise.  
</P>
<P>
 In those days, discount merchandising was unfamiliar to Japanese businessmen, 
and Marukai seemed like a bold idea. "Matsu is a creative risk taker," says 
Noda. The risk clearly paid off, for Marukai soon needed to expand into its 
present, much larger location on Vermont.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently other Japanese stores have begun to compete with Marukai's low-price 
deals, so I can't promise you won't find similar prices elsewhere. But Matsu is 
thinking ahead and he has changed his strategy once again.  
</P>
<P>
 The desire for excellent service, he feels, is making a comeback among his 
customers. His service-oriented "New Marukai," presently under construction, 
promises to be as imaginative as his discount merchandising in the early '80s. 
In addition to such conveniences as dry cleaners, mailing service center and 
shops such as a florist, and a food court, New Marukai will display cultural 
exhibits from the various provinces of Japan. The displays will give customers 
the opportunity to educate themselves about such traditional things as kimonos, 
regional porcelain and Buddhist altar goods. Cultural programs and cooking 
classes are also scheduled.  
</P>
<P>
 New Marukai will also have a recycling center and offer 
environmentally-friendly products such as organic produce and household 
cleaning agents. A philosophy has evolved here, one of "using business to bring 
the old and new together to help the 21st century work for our children," says 
a blurb for New Marukai. That will be another story. Shopping List 
</P>
<P>
 SUSHI MADE EASY  
</P>
<P>
 Watching a skilled itame-san working behind a restaurant sushi counter can 
easily intimidate a non-Japanese cook. But making sushi at home really isn't an 
impossible task. Almost everyone in Japan can make several kinds of home-style 
sushi. The easiest version, chirashi sushi, is simply a bowl of sushi meshi 
(rice prepared for sushi) tossed together salad-style with finely cut fish and 
other ingredients. Some chirashi have one or more kinds of sashimi with 
garnishes and pickles arranged on top of the rice.  
</P>
<P>
 The second easiest home-style sushi, hako-zushi , is made by pressing the rice 
and fish or other topping into variously shaped molds called kata. The finished 
sushi is simply unmolded.  
</P>
<P>
 There's also inari-zushi . For this style you buy deep-fried tofu squares 
called abura-age from the tofu section. When thin slices of tofu are 
deep-fried, they puff up, leaving a pita-bread-like hollow to be filled with 
plain sushi meshi or rice mixed with chopped vegetables or smoked salmon. 
Marukai has everything you need for these sushi styles.  
</P>
<P>
 * Sushi Rice Flavoring (Sushinoko): Preparing sushi meshi , the vinegared rice 
for sushi, can be a difficult chore because there is no single recipe to guide 
the cook. If the rice is very moist you need less vinegar than for drier rice, 
and if you need less vinegar you need less sweetener, and so on. Sushinoko 
eliminates those problems. Simply sprinkle a 75-gram bag of this powdered, 
seasoned and sweetened vinegar over four cups of cooked short-grain rice and 
mix well.  
</P>
<P>
 * Rice Cookers: For perfect rice, all you really must know is how to turn on a 
rice cooker. You'll rarely see such a vast selection of these gadgets in one 
place as at Marukai. They range from one cup to 10 cups in capacity. And some 
brands offer deluxe models that can be programmed to turn on and off at any 
hour automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sushi Forms: Marukai has dozens of forms to make sushi. Some are plastic, 
others wood. They turn out thick or thin sushi rolls, triangles and various 
kinds of layered sushi. Most have "international" labels with easy-to-follow 
pictographic directions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prepared Wasabi: The Japanese horseradish, wasabi , is said to stimulate the 
taste buds and digestive juices. It is fabulous when freshly grated. But fresh 
wasabi is difficult to get, even in Japan. Most restaurants end up mixing the 
powdered, dehydrated wasabi with water to get that familiar smooth green paste. 
Now wasabi comes in the slightly better form of toothpaste-type tubes. You 
don't have to mix, and the tube ejects only as much wasabi as you need. Look 
for several brands of wasabi in tubes against the north wall of the store. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sushi Fixings: Marukai imports canned Sushi Mix under its own label. The 
seasoned, assorted vegetables and tofu that make up the mix are often used for 
vegetarian sushi or futomaki , a thick roll of rice wrapped in roasted sushi 
nori.  
</P>
<P>
 * Canned Quail Eggs (which for some inexplicable reason are in the canned 
fruit section) make a charming garnish for chirashi , or they may be used at 
the center of a sushi roll. Marukai's fish department is, naturally enough, 
another good source of sushi materials.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NOODLES, RICE AND MORE  
</P>
<P>
 * Soba: Japan's famous buckwheat noodles may be humble or luxurious. Buckwheat 
was once the grain of poor farmers who couldn't afford, and often weren't 
allowed, to eat rice. Now in some parts of Japan soba has become a status food, 
requiring hand-milled, specially grown buckwheat, purified water and 
noodle-making masters with years of training.  
</P>
<P>
 The soba selection at Marukai boggles the mind. Start in the cooler section, 
where there is plain fresh soba (made in L.A.'s Little Tokyo) or fresh 
Japanese-made soba with soup packets to which you need only add water. Then 
move on to the dry noodle section. There you find plain soba of varied lengths 
and thicknesses. The various brands of cha soba contain powdered green tea. The 
yamaimo sobas are made with a little mountain yam ( yamaimo ) that gives the 
noodles a slight springiness.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the regional soba styles is wanko soba, unusual for its short (barely 
four inches) lengths. Kirishina soba , a thin but irregularly shaped noodle 
with a rustic quality, is reminiscent of noodles handmade in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 * Soba Tsuyu: So what do you do with soba ? You eat it with garnishes and soba 
tsuyu , a soup-like mixture of fish-stock, soy sauce and either mirin or sugar. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Serve cooked fresh soba chilled on a mat and accompany it with a bowl of the 
tsuyu , a small mound of thinly sliced scallions and a little wasabi . To eat 
the noodles, pick them up with chopsticks or a fork, swish them in the sauce 
and quickly down them (the sauce doesn't cling for very long). The tsuyu may 
also be heated and the noodles served in this broth topped with steamed 
vegetables, tsuyu- seasoned chicken chunks or beef.  
</P>
<P>
 Tsuyus have recently come on the market in concentrated form. Kikkoman's Nemmi 
sauce is one such example. Tsuyus are also available in a fully prepared form 
called " straight type." In addition to soba tsuyu there are udon tsuyu and 
somen tsuyu (made with a thin wheat noodle). Each is appropriately seasoned for 
its particular noodle. Some brands of tsuyu are made without MSG.  
</P>
<P>
 * Soba Konnyaku: Chewy and mint-green colored, these precooked strands are not 
soba but a condiment for it. Konnyaku , colloquially known as devil's tongue 
jelly, is a firm, gelatinous substance made from a starchy root. It also comes 
in blocks that are cut into shapes and simmered in soupy broths or stews. Soba 
konnyaku , meanwhile, is eaten chilled with soba tsuyu . Marukai imports its 
own brand of soba konnyaku . A woman demonstrating the product told me it was 
delicious cut into short lengths and made into a salad with lettuce, crab (or 
imitation crab) and a Japanese salad dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shirataki: Another noodle-like form of konnyaku , shirataki , is also known 
as white waterfall for its glassy, shimmery appearance. Shirataki is popular as 
a sukiyaki ingredient because it soaks up the flavorful broth.  
</P>
<P>
 * Truly Instant Rice: Rice, the absolute essential part of most meals, is 
usually cooked by the gallon in most Japanese homes. But for the couple or lone 
diner in a hurry, packaged cooked rice is the ultimate Japanese emergency food. 
It can be stored unrefrigerated. Simply boil the unopened pouch for about 10 
minutes or heat in a microwave for two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SEASONINGS AND FLAVORINGS  
</P>
<P>
 * Kasu: Officially called sake lees, this fermented mash of rice is what 
remains after sake is made. Kasu tastes very much like sake, and like sake, it 
is said to remove the fishy smell from fish and to tenderize foods. There's a 
marinade for fish called kasuzuke (roughly, "soaked lees"). 
</P>
<P>
 Kasu looks like uncooked oat bran in cream, and it's a rather odd sight to see 
slices of cod or salmon (which you find in the fish department) marinated in 
it. There is also something called itah kasu that is firmer, like a raw dough. 
Plain kasu in plastic bags is stored in the cooler with the miso. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mirin: It's been said that at the heart of Japanese cooking is the trio of 
dashi (fish stock), soy sauce and mirin; they are used together in everything 
from soups and cooking broths to noodle dipping sauces. Occasionally labeled in 
English as sweet rice wine, mirin is almost syrup-like, with an exceptionally 
low alcohol content. In cooking you must never substitute sake for mirin but 
rather use plain sugar.  
</P>
<P>
 Mirin is especially pleasing when boiled and reduced to a viscous syrup, 
seasoned with soy sauce and used as a glaze for grilled foods. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sukiyaki Sauce Base: Sukiyaki, which means "plowshare-grilled," got its name 
from the time Buddhist laws forbade eating meat. Hungry peasants, when lucky 
enough to find game, would grill it in the fields right on their plowshares. It 
was reasoned that if you didn't take the game home to cook, then it wouldn't 
count as an official meal and you were not violating any precepts.  
</P>
<P>
 Beef, a relatively new food in Japanese cuisine, has become the star of 
sukiyaki, but the dish is also made with all sorts of other foods. Shirataki 
and tofu are popular ingredients because they soak up sukiyaki's delicious 
sauce. One of the most popular sukiyaki dishes, udon suki , is made with 
seafood (obviously not found in the farmer's fields) and thick wheat noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 But sukiyaki is simply grilled meat (or chicken or fish) to which you add a 
sauce and then vegetables. If sukiyaki is prepared at the table, diners often 
cook their own vegetables a few at a time in the broth.  
</P>
<P>
 Marukai sells a sauce concentrate that you simply pour onto the meat after it 
is grilled and then add vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shabu-Shabu Dipping Sauces: Shabu-shabu is another cooked-at-the-table beef 
dish like sukiyaki, and is likewise new to Japanese food. It's supposedly named 
after the sound made when the beef gets swished-swished through bubbling water 
as diners cook it in their table-top hot pot. Cooked like this, the beef and 
ensuing vegetables are pretty bland, but several delicious dipping sauces are 
usually served alongside to season them. 
</P>
<P>
 Marukai stocks two of these sauces. The first, with a sesame paste base, is 
rich and creamy with the slight tang of vinegar and garlic. The second is soy 
sauce-based and spiked with mirin, lemon juice and rice vinegar. Look for these 
at the back of the store with all the other sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Umeboshi: Somehow the Japanese palate is in love with the excruciatingly 
sour taste of umeboshi , the pickled green plums that make your hair stand on 
end. There is even an umeboshi -flavored chewing gum for those who want more 
than a quick hit of sourness.  
</P>
<P>
 Salt and red amaranth leaves flavor and add color to umeboshi, which are 
regarded as a digestive aid, a breath freshener and an eye opener at breakfast 
(which they surely are).  
</P>
<P>
 Marukai has many brands of umeboshi : tiny ones the size of peanuts and others 
slightly smaller than a prune. Some are flavored with dried bonito fish. Some 
umeboshi are packed in globe-like jars with a drape of cellophane under their 
lids that is designed to resemble a cloth or towel. The packaging is meant to 
evoke the old-fashioned pickling jars that people used when they made their own 
umeboshi at home.  
</P>
<P>
 In pureed form, strained to remove the plum skins, umeboshi are used to season 
sauces. Occasionally, you'll find a sushi recipe that calls for umeboshi puree 
(also called bainiku ). 
</P>
<P>
 * Demi-Cured Pickles: Kyuri usujio ichiyazuke -- literally lightly salted 
cucumber, pickled one night -- is the half-cured dill of the Japanese pickle 
world. Most non-Japanese find these extremely pleasant because they're not as 
salty and strong as other Japanese pickles. Look for them in the pickle cooler 
near the fish department.

THE TOMATO KING OF GREENSBURG, PA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE ZIFF COOL, Cool is the author of Tomatoes: A Country Garden Cookbook 
(Collins Publishers: San Francisco). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People are competitive about their garden tomatoes in Greensburg, Pa., my home 
town. Certainly my dad was. The main rivalry focused on who had the first ripe 
tomato in town. The second was deciding who grew the most perfect-looking 
tomato. The third, for which my dad always took the prize, was whose tomatoes 
tasted best. 
</P>
<P>
 Dad's tomato mentor was Dan Antonucci, who taught him how tomatoes were grown 
back in Italy and gave him seeds from his own garden, heirloom tomato varieties 
Antonucci's family had brought over in the early 1900s. Some of them no one 
could identify. Dad would save the seeds from his favorites, and year after 
year he produced the meatiest Romas, the plumpest little yellow pear tomatoes 
and the biggest, bumpiest, most luscious beefsteaks in western Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Dad took great pride in the fact that he followed Antonucci's old-fashioned 
gardening practices. He scoffed when all the other neighbors used pesticides 
and artificial fertilizers. My dad was convinced that this was why his tomatoes 
tasted better than any others -- except Antonucci's, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 He chose the sunniest spots in the corner of our back yard to grow his 
beauties. A small brick wall held up a 10x10-foot raised bed dedicated to his 
tomatoes. It was on this wall that I sat every summer, saltshaker in hand, 
awaiting my first bite of warm ripe tomato. That moment became a sacred yearly 
ritual for my father and me. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, I devoured tomatoes as if they were juicy peaches. My mom made me 
stay outside to eat them because I loved the feel of the juices dripping down 
my chin. The sweet smell of the tomato intoxicated me as well, and I hoped that 
rinsing my hands would not wash away the scent. When I wanted to splurge, I 
made my favorite sandwich of thick slices of beefsteak tomato, home-grown 
onions, lettuce and mayonnaise on soft white bread. I was in paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the growing season, we ate lots of unripe green tomatoes. 
Mom would bread and fry them. Dad dipped them in garlic and oil and grilled 
them next to rib eye steaks. My brothers hated them; I couldn't get enough. 
</P>
<P>

 Ratatouille is a classic dish that is treated differently by every cook. It is 
the recipe of choice when your neighbor brings you one more basketful of 
vegetables from her prolific summer garden. Slow oven-roasting deepens the 
flavors. Traditionally, each vegetable is cooked separately. Ros Creasy, author 
and gardening expert, and I agree that cooking them all together encourages the 
various vegetables to blend and absorb one another's flavors. Double the recipe 
if you want leftovers. Toss ratatouille with pasta, serve as a bed under 
grilled fish fillets or as an appetizer with plenty of bread, salty olives, 
aioli and glasses of red wine.  
</P>
<P>
 OVEN-ROASTED RATATOUILLE 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 medium tomatoes, seeded and cut into 1- to 2-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium eggplant (globe, rosa bianca or Japanese), peeled, cut into 1- to 
2-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium sweet red pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch squares 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium yellow onion, cut into 1-inch chunks 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium golden summer squash, cut into 1-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 10 cloves garlic, optional 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 5 fresh oregano or sage sprigs 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup fruity red wine 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Place tomatoes, eggplant, sweet red pepper, onions and squash in heavy 3-quart 
baking dish. Add garlic, oil, oregano and wine. Toss with vegetables. Bake, 
covered, at 350 degrees 30 minutes. Remove from oven and baste vegetables with 
pan juices. Cover again and bake until vegetables are very tender, 15 to 30 
minutes longer. (In this dish, vegetables should not be al dente.) Mix in 
basil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Let ratatouille cool slightly 
before serving. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

more at room temperature, turning occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove lamb chops from marinade and pan-fry or grill until done. To serve, 
place about 3/4 cup Chile-Mashed Potatoes on each dinner plate. Arrange lamb 
chop on side of potatoes. Garnish with 2 generous tablespoons Tomato-Pear 
Chutney. Sprinkle lamb chop with mint to taste. Makes 4 servings. Chile-Mashed 
Potatoes 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds boiling potatoes, preferably new potatoes, peeled, cut into chunks if 
large 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup sour cream 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons finely chopped Anaheim or serrano chiles 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 to 1/2 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 In large pan cook potatoes in abundant boiling water until soft. Drain. While 
potatoes are still hot, mash in butter, sour cream and chiles and add milk 
gradually until potatoes are light and fluffy. Season to taste with salt. 
Tomato-Pear Chutney 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups peeled, cored and coarsely chopped pears 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup raisins 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups light-brown sugar, packed

<P>
 2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
 In 2-quart nonreactive pan combine tomatoes, pears, onion, raisins, sugar, 
vinegar, ginger root, mustard seeds, cinnamon sticks, chiles and salt. Simmer 
over low heat, mixing occasionally, until all fruit is tender and chutney 
begins to thicken, about 1 hour. Remove cinnamon sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve as much chutney as desired for this meal. Spoon remaining mixture into 
sterilized jars. Place lids on top and store in refrigerator up to 6 weeks or 
in cool, dark place. Makes 5 to 6 pints. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This is possibly the best way to eat a perfectly ripe, juicy tomato. However, 
the success of this dish lies entirely in the quality of the ingredients. Don't 
even bother serving it unless the tomatoes are as sweet as sugar. Use 
top-quality olive oil and fresh, delicate mozzarella. They're worth a few cents 
more. If you can find boconcini or small mozzarella balls, they are wonderful. 
If you can't find three different kinds of basil, the sweet green variety will 
do just fine.  
</P>
<P>
 TOMATO, ONION, FRESH MOZZARELLA AND THREE-BASIL SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 3 pounds ripe tomatoes, room-temperature, thickly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium red onion, very thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup fresh basil leaves of any combination of sweet green, purple, lemon, 
cinnamon, Thai or chocolate, coarsely chopped, plus several sprigs for garnish 
</P>
<P>
 6 to 8 ounces fresh mozzarella, thickly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 to 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 6 tablespoons balsamic or red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Layer tomatoes, onion and chopped basil on large platter. Top with mozzarella 
slices. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with vinegar. Season to taste with salt 
and pepper. Garnish with sprigs of fresh basil. Makes 4 servings.

FALL FOR FIGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIE SIMMONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Romans used to boil ham with figs. Apicius, the famous Roman gourmand, 
encouraged his hogs to eat figs, so their meat would taste even better. 
</P>
<P>
 History aside, I am happy that fresh figs are in season again. I am eating 
cut-up figs over vanilla ice cream, figs with prosciutto, figs arranged on 
arugula leaves and drizzled with olive oil, fresh fig tart, and just plain figs 
out of hand -- preferably while sitting in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, only a few varieties of figs are available commercially, 
and most of them are grown in California. The Black Mission, named for the 
Spanish missions at which figs were first cultivated, are small and dark-purple 
and have a deep, rich flavor. The Calimyrna (a variety of the Smyrna fig of 
Izmir, Turkey, where the fruit is purported to have first been cultivated) is 
plump, green and very juicy. The Kadota, another green variety, is "taller" 
than the Calimyrna but just as sweet and fragrant. 
</P>
<P>
 The hundreds of other varieties of figs worldwide all vary somewhat in 
exterior and interior appearance. Personally, I find ripeness more important 
than variety. 
</P>
<P>
 A ripe fig is soft with the sensation of sweetness -- but not sugar -- when 
one takes a bite. The taste is really about texture. Most figs are thin-skinned 
and don't need to be peeled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My latest passion is for fig clafouti , a baked pudding typically made with 
cherries and originally from the Limousin region of France. It makes a rich and 
wonderful dessert after a light and easy (no cooking required) summer supper of 
sliced meats and tomato, corn and cucumber salad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This salad is great with any fresh herbs you may have on hand. In addition (or 
instead of) the basil use cilantro, or add a tablespoon of fresh oregano or 
thyme leaves.  
</P>
<P>
 TOMATO, CORN AND CUCUMBER SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 1 garlic clove, halved 
</P>
<P>
 2 large ripe tomatoes, cored and quartered 
</P>
<P>
 2 ears corn, husked, kernels cut from cobs 
</P>
<P>
 1 cucumber, peeled, halved lengthwise and sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup fresh basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Rub inside of large shallow bowl with cut side of garlic clove. Reserve garlic 
for another dish. Add tomatoes, corn kernels, cucumber and basil. Season to 
taste generously with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil. Toss to combine. 
Serve at room temperature. Makes 4 generous servings. FIG CLAFOUTI 
</P>
<P>
 Butter and sugar for baking dish 
</P>
<P>
 1 pint fresh figs, rinsed, stems trimmed, halved lengthwise 
</P>
<P>
 4 large eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup whipping cream or half and half 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 Butter 10-inch glass pie plate or shallow 2-quart baking dish. Sprinkle 
lightly with thin film of sugar, about 2 tablespoons. Arrange figs, cut side 
up, in baking dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat eggs in large bowl with whisk until foamy. Add milk, cream, 1/4 cup 
sugar, vanilla and salt. Stir until blended. Add flour and stir just until 
blended. Pour mixture slowly over figs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 375 degrees until clafouti is puffed and lightly browned, about 35 
minutes. Sprinkle with additional sugar. Serve warm. Makes 8 servings.

 I read your article on mayonnaise ("Don't Hold the Mayo," Sept. 1) and very 
much agree with you about Hellmann's-Best Foods.I have not found its equal in 
50 years. During World War II, we were just married and living in Nashville. I 
could not find my favorite mayonnaise anywhere. I had my parents on Long Island 
send me a case of quarts. I put a few in the refrigerator and the rest on a 
shelf in the garage. I did not realize that the hot afternoon sun was shining 
on the shelf. I was devastated to find that all the jars in the garage had 
spoiled. It was a sad mistake, especially during wartime.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: DOWNEY; SENIORS MOVE TO BLOCK GYMNASIUM PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of senior citizens is gathering signatures for a referendum to block 
city plans to build an activities center and gymnasium at Apollo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has spent about nine months trying to persuade the city that a 
center exclusively for senior citizens is needed rather than an activities 
facility that serves all residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the referendum effort have to collect about 4,000 signatures 
from registered voters by Oct. 13 to force a special election, said City Clerk 
Judith E. McDonnell. If enough signatures are collected, the city will have to 
delay its plans to design and build the center, McDonnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Orlando, who is in charge of the referendum, said nearby cities Lakewood, 
Pico Rivera and Cerritos have centers for senior citizens. "The City Council is 
not paying any attention to the seniors of Downey," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 last week to build a gymnasium and renovate a 
building at Apollo Park for the activities center at a cost of $3.5 million. 
Councilwoman Joyce Lawrence, who said senior citizens should have their own 
center, cast the dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 As a compromise, the council decided to allow senior citizens almost exclusive 
use of the new facility during the day. Other community members will have 
access to the building at night. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics said senior citizens should have their own center. They also said 
Apollo Park is a poor location because it is difficult to reach by bus and has 
limited parking. JOHN CANALIS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: NORWALK; CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAM APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed to launch a curbside recycling program in January 
that will help the city meet 1995 state environmental laws, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each single-family home will receive an 18-gallon bin for glass, newsprint, 
plastic, aluminum and other metals by January.The city will distribute 
containers to apartments and businesses between January and June. Residents 
will be asked to group their recyclables in the bins by the type of material. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities are required by state law to recycle 25% of their waste by 1995. 
Norwalk currently recycles about 10% of its trash, said Daniel E. Keen, deputy 
city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 After the recycling program is in place, the city will begin an automated 
trash collection service in 1996. Each home will be issued a 100-gallon bin but 
residents will have the option of using 30-gallon or 60-gallon containers. 
Monthly trash rates will be based on the size of the bin a household uses as an 
incentive for residents to recycle more of their trash, Keen said. "You would 
pay based on what you generate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens and others who may have difficulty pushing the containers can 
request smaller receptacles at no charge, Keen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly trash bills also will drop slightly in January because the city has 
turned its trash-billing operation over to two private companies, Keen said. 
Bills for all single-family homes will drop by 44 cents, from $12.45 to $12.01 
a month, Keen said. New bills for apartments will be based on the size and 
number of units in a complex. The bills are sent to building owners. JOHN

<P>
 The City Council has approved a temporary barricade on Manzanar Avenue to stem 
the flow of traffic off of heavily traveled Telegraph Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous drivers have been using Manzanar, a residential street, to avoid the 
crowded intersection of Rosemead Boulevard and Telegraph Road, and residents 
along Manzanar complained that heavy traffic was unsafe.A recent survey found 
that 768 vehicles a day used Manzanar, compared to a range of 103 to 240 cars 
per day on similar streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Manzanar will be barricaded north of Telegraph in early October for a 
two-month trial period, officials said. Three cross streets north of the 
barricade will provide access to the neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 Resident Richard Salcido praised the decision. "There are too many cars 
driving down here too fast," he said. JOHN D. WAGNER

PRESCHOOL WORKERS, KIDS TESTED FOR LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City health officials are examining children for possible lead exposure after 
recent tests found soil and work-surface contamination at a city-owned 
recreation and preschool facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Test results from 14 preschoolers and two employees who worked at the Long 
Beach Model Boat Shop have produced no evidence of lead exposure, city health 
officer Darryl Sexton said.The health department is also testing 14 more 
preschoolers and 10% of the nearly 300 children who constructed model boats at 
the site over the past two summers, Sexton said. 
</P>
<P>
 City parks and recreation officials ordered lead contamination tests at the 
boat shop in August after a parent complained that children were filing lead 
moldings as part of a model-boat construction program, city recreation Supt. 
Jana Ransom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials halted the summer model-building program and closed the 60-year-old 
boat shop near the Colorado Lagoon at 5119 Colorado St. when test results 
showed lead contamination above acceptable state and federal levels. No 
contamination was reported in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes at the Colorado Lagoon Preschool Co-op had been scheduled to resume 
after summer break, but were relocated to Whaley Park at 5620 Atherton St. 
until environmental tests are complete. The preschool had rented the model boat 
shop from the city since 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexton said he was optimistic the facility could be cleaned up and reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facility can be used again," Sexton said. "This is not like radiation." 
He noted, however, that recreation officials will have to find an alternative 
metal for the keels. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead exposure only poses risks when it is ingested, Sexton said. If it is, it 
can be especially dangerous to children under 6 years old, possibly leading to 
brain and kidney damage and even death, he said.

A UNIFORM SUCCESS; MOST PUPILS COMPLY WITH NEW SCHOOL-DRESS RULE. A BONUS: 
FEWER PLAYGROUND SCUFFLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Most elementary and middle-school students in Long Beach are complying with 
the district's new voluntary policy to wear uniforms in class, administrators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools reported that 90% to 98% of their students were dressed in uniforms 
during the first week of classes, administrators said. Playgrounds that were 
once full of children in denim jeans and T-shirts are now full of students 
attired in white tops and navy blue skirts and pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators say they have already noted an improvement in behavior. For 
example, schoolyard scuffles have declined at Clara Barton Elementary School, 
where all of the 995 students must wear ties as well as uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't fight when you're dressed up," Principal Lue Dean Magee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach school board's policy requires students from kindergarten 
through eighth grade to be in uniform. Board members claim uniforms help 
students learn and may help protect them from gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who object to uniforms must request an exemption for their children at 
individual schools. But so far, administrators said, few parents have filed 
such requests. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they will not begin enforcing the uniform policy until 
Oct. 14. Enforcement will be left up to officials at individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals at many schools said they favor rewarding students who wear 
uniforms rather than punishing those who don't. Before the deadline, 
administrators plan to speak to students who show up at school without uniforms 
and don't have an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not embarrassing the child in front of anyone. We're just asking them 
if there's a reason they don't have a uniform," said Marnos B. Lelesi, 
principal at Theodore Roosevelt Elementary School. "To me, it isn't a greater 
expectation than we would have for a student who didn't do their homework." 
</P>
<P>
 Lelesi said she and other administrators have found the main reason children 
have not worn uniforms is that parents can't afford them.  
</P>
<P>
 Most schools are still seeking donations of uniforms for needy students, but 
so far demand has far exceeded donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rick Rackers Junior Auxiliary of the Assistance League of Long Beach is 
expected to donate two complete uniforms to 1,200 children this year, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools are using their own money to buy uniforms to lend to students, or 
have approached church organizations, service clubs, thrift stores and 
individuals for contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators at Benjamin Franklin Middle School spent about $200 to buy 
shirts, pants and skirts to lend, but that provides uniforms for only a 
fraction of the students who need them. About 75 to 100 of the school's 1,200 
students don't wear uniforms, Principal Gregg Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 The borrowed uniforms are handed out at the start of the day but must be 
returned after school, Stone said, adding that staff members are washing dirty 
uniforms. "At times, I've taken a bag home and done it myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said he has not received any letters from parents requesting an 
exemption from the policy. In fact, some parents said they are trying to save 
money to buy several sets of uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some opponents of uniforms say, however, that most parents still do not know 
the policy is voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Eugene E. Kinsey said he and other parents are upset that principals at 
two schools said uniforms are mandatory and warned that they plan to punish 
students who fail to wear them.  
</P>
<P>
 One flyer at Hoover Middle School incorrectly reported that students would be 
penalized if they failed to wear a uniform, district spokesman Dick Van Der 
Laan said. The statement has since been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 A new state law allows public schools to require uniforms, but must allow 
exemptions for families opposed to uniforms.  
</P>
<P>
 Kinsey said he and other parents are distributing flyers to students and their 
parents reminding them of their right to opt out.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; MYSTERY OF BLUE PLASTIC DEBRIS ON BEACH SOLVED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Coast Guard officials have determined that hundreds of small, sky-blue 
plastic spirals and sponges that washed ashore in Seal Beach this summer were 
inadvertently released into the San Gabriel River by two Long Beach electric 
generating stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The inch-long spirals and sponges, considered nontoxic by county health 
officials, are flushed through power plant pipes to scrub away algae. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power admitted responsibility for all 
of the sponges and a small quantity of the spirals, which were released from 
the Haynes Generating Station in Long Beach. But a Southern California Edison 
Co. spokesman said that after a thorough investigation, company officials 
determined that none of the blue spirals came from Edison's Alamitos Generating 
Station, located directly across the San Gabriel River from the Haynes power 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Bosworth, superintendent of the Haynes station, said the DWP power 
plant typically uses the sponges instead of the blue spirals. "We try not to 
point fingers at each other," Bosworth said. "We could have lost a small number 
of those blue rubber spirals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard inspected operations at both electric generating stations. 
Neither plant will be fined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to require both facilities to change how they retrieve these 
things after use," said Lt. Mark Cunningham, chief of the Coast Guard marine 
environmental response division. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Labedz, an environmental activist with the Surfrider Foundation and a 
Seal Beach resident, said hundreds of the blue spirals have littered beaches 
during the summer but only a few have washed up in recent days. RUSS LOAR

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Civic Light Opera has appointed Phillip Keene as interim executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Keene, who also serves as president of the California Tourism Corp., started 
his new job last week.He succeeds Clare Faulkner, who left in August to take a 
job with the California State University system. Producer Barry Brown also left 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The two departures forced the Civic Light Opera to postpone the season opener, 
"Can-Can," from October to January. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the opera's financial problems, which caused some theater board 
members to warn that the company was on the verge of collapse, Keene said he is 
certain the theater is heading for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are challenges, but there are also all the right ingredients for 
success," said Keene, 53, who added that his primary goal is to implement the 
opera's new business plan. He accepted a 90-day contract with the Civic Light 
Opera, with the possibility that his stay will be extended. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the City Council approved a $490,000-per-year funding package for 
the next two years for the Civic Light Opera. The funds will be available 
provided the theater can raise a matching amount. EMILY ADAMS

<P>
 School officials are moving forward with a plan to build a golf driving range 
next to Dominguez High School as part of a joint venture with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, school officials tentatively approved plans to build the range on 
7.6 acres of land owned by the district, Supt.Harold L. Cebrun said. Final 
approval is expected next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has proposed leasing the land for $50,000 to $60,000 annually for 
about 20 years. The district may also receive a percentage of the revenues 
generated at the range, Cebrun said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has also asked the city to relocate the high school's tennis 
courts from the area next to the empty lot and to upgrade some fields at the 
school, Cebrun added. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sotelo, who is coordinating the project for the city, said Compton has 
been trying to build the range for six years to complement a nearby city-owned 
golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan must still be approved by the City Council, which is scheduled to 
review it next month. Groundbreaking would begin early next year, with 
completion by May, 1995. PSYCHE PASCUAL

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; PANEL CALLS FOR SENIOR HOUSING ON NAVY LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Housing for senior citizens will be built on 27 acres of surplus Navy property 
in San Pedro if a group of local residents gets its way. 
</P>
<P>
 In a document released recently, the San Pedro Area Reuse Committee said 
senior housing is the best use of the land at Taper Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents the harbor district, 
appointed the committee earlier this year to look at options for military land 
left vacant in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has been concentrating on the Taper Avenue site, which has been 
at the center of community debate and concern since an annoucement in January 
that its 144 housing units would be used for up to 880 homeless people after 
the Long Beach Naval Station closes this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials approved an application by Turner's Technical Institute 
Inc., a South-Central homeless advocacy organization, to run the homeless 
shelter. The committee plan for senior housing assumes that Turner's plan will 
be derailed, secretary Jerry Gaines said. Samuel Theus, Turner's spokesman, 
said the institute would consider working with the San Pedro groups. "But it 
would have to be a program for homeless people," Theus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the committee's plan, the housing would include affordable houses, 
assisted living, a nursing home, geriatric day care, a recreation center, open 
space and walking trails. Outreach programs also would operate from the 
complex. The report says the number of senior citizens in the San 
Pedro/Wilmington area living in poverty increased 26% between 1980 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations will be discussed at a public hearing Sept. 29 at 7 p.m. 
in Peck Park Auditorium, 560 N. Western Ave., San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the federal department of Health and Human Services is 
reviewing the homeless shelter plan by Turner's Institute in light of strong 
community and political opposition. SUSAN WOODWARD

THE NEW BIG MAN ON CAMPUS; ROBERT MAXSON SAYS LONG BEACH STATE HAS THE 
POTENTIAL TO OVERCOME ITS PROBLEMS AND BECOME ONE OF THE NATION'S TOP 5 URBAN 
UNIVERSITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's a few days into the fall semester on the campus of California State 
University, Long Beach, and clearly there are a lot of kinks that need to be 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 A few surly, last-minute enrollees stand in line at the Administration 
Building, waiting to pay fees that are up 10% this year. Motorists glumly 
circle the campus, looking for somewhere -- anywhere -- to park. Here and 
there, students loll under towering eucalyptus trees, griping about overcrowded 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter university President Robert C. Maxson, 58, a slim, sharp-featured man 
with a dazzling smile that reveals teeth as white as piano keys. He's on one of 
his frequent perambulatory dashes across the campus, dispensing high fives to 
students and loud greetings to faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look at this," he marvels to a visitor whom he has just hustled from his 
office to the busy South Campus, where students mingle and schmooze. "This is 
where it's happening. Look at those fresh-scrubbed faces." 
</P>
<P>
 After $36 million in budget cuts over the past four years, there are definite 
signs of distress here and there -- like the battened-down parking structure 
that awaits $3 million in seismic retrofitting and the waiting lines in 
chemistry labs, where students must take turns using spectrophotometers and pH 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
 And where are the usual signs of autumn on this college campus? There's not a 
single athlete with big shoulder pads and cleats. The $1.3-million-a-year 
football program was erased three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But three months into his tenure as the school's president, Maxson is already 
catching the rhythm of the place and imposing some subtle changes of his own, 
increasing the tempo and focusing attention on recent accomplishments at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 In his quick-step tours, Maxson doesn't see problems. He sees a campus 
brimming with youthful energy and academic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a glass-is-half-full sort of a person," says Toni Beron, assistant vice 
president for public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't say we're going to be one of the best four or five universities in 
the nation in the next 10 years, but I think we've got a chance to be one of 
the best four or five urban universities," Maxson says with conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 An urban university, he explains, serves a large number of non-traditional 
students who don't fit the mold of youthful, American-born high school 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 The urban university also assumes a mission of solving urban problems, Maxson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 5 million people within a 20-mile radius here," he says. "They have 
real social, economic and political problems, problems of safety. I see the 
urban university dealing with the problems of its metropolitan center."  
</P>
<P>
 The high-powered Arkansas-born president arrived after 10 years at the 
University of Nevada, Las Vegas, with a reputation as a consummate fund-raiser 
with lofty ideals. He has set some high goals for himself and his new school, 
which is paying him $142,000 a year, $18,000 less than he earned at UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his leadership, Long Beach State will be a student-friendly place, with 
more on-campus residences and cultural programs, he says. "I submit that you 
can measure the morale of a university by the number of people you see on 
campus on Saturdays and Sundays," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a vigorous athletic program -- though not quite so vigorous as 
the star-studded basketball program at UNLV, where Maxson tangled with Coach 
Jerry Tarkanian in a highly publicized feud over recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian recently blamed Maxson for a storm of negative publicity that led to 
his 1992 resignation and the school being placed on probation by the NCAA. 
Maxson now prefers not to talk about the feud, which divided the Las Vegas 
civic community. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, Maxson envisions Long Beach State as an academic mecca, a 
gathering place for high school valedictorians and the school of choice for top 
students from all over the region. "I don't think we'll ever be a great 
university if we're always the second, third or fourth choice for the students 
who come here," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also committed to raising $20 million in contributions to make up for 
some of the funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Maxson's brand of positive thinking is sweet music to the 
long-suffering faculty and students. When he addressed a convocation of faculty 
and staff a few weeks ago and described his vision of the 322-acre campus as a 
great university, a few people shed tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really one of the few people I've heard who truly believes that the 
university is here because of the students," says Suzie S. Aramesh, president 
of Associated Students, the school's student government organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message that he really cares about serving the students -- it's one that 
people really want to hear," says Dorothy M. Goldish, chairwoman of the 
Academic Senate, the school's principal faculty organization. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a battle-scarred quality to members of the university community who 
have been around since 1990 -- like soldiers ready to dive for cover at the 
least sign of incoming fire. For the fifth year in a row, the school absorbed a 
cut this year -- $1.9 million. After prior cuts of as much as $17 million, this 
was widely perceived as a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the continuous shortfall has left in its wake: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rising fees. Students now pay $1,584 in annual tuition, up from $1,440 last 
year, and the CSU trustees are already talking about a 10% increase next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unrepaired buildings. In the history department, staff put plastic sheets 
over desks during the rainy season because of leaking roofs. In chemistry 
laboratories, experiments are often spoiled because faulty heating and 
ventilation systems lead to temperature extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lack of parking. As 26,500 students try to fit into 10,391 parking spots, a 
new 2,800-space garage remains locked. After a Cal State Northridge garage 
collapsed during the Jan. 17 earthquake, seismic engineers recommended 
additional reinforcement at the Long Beach State garage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crowded classrooms. There are still courses in which student demand is 
greater than supply. There is a widespread perception among students that it's 
next to impossible to get a degree in four years because of the lines of 
students waiting to get into basic courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all is a pervasive sense of malaise. "You really have to stretch to 
find things to be cheerful about," says Goldish, who is a chemistry professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson says the dispirited talk has a ring of self-fulfilling prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I've got a youngster who wants to be a doctor or an attorney," he says, 
"and he says it will take six or seven years to graduate here and classes are 
going to be large and in some way the quality has diminished -- well, I'll take 
out a second mortgage to send the youngster someplace (else)." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the perception of diminishment is mistaken, says the 
glass-is-half-full man. CSULB is a thriving university with an intriguingly 
diverse student body and a top-notch faculty, he insists. As for the budget 
problems, help is on the way, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 If anybody can jump-start the school's sputtering engine, it's Robert Maxson, 
according to his former associates in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Wynn, a member and former chairman of the UNLV Foundation, still 
grieves over his departure from Las Vegas. "I'm sad that he's gone," she says. 
"I think this is California's big break that they've got him now." 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenal transformation of UNLV under Maxson is almost legendary. Less 
than a mile from the Las Vegas Strip, UNLV was an academic 90-pound weakling, 
derided as "Tumbleweed Tech" and "Green Felt U" when Maxson arrived in 1984.  
</P>
<P>
 High-minded, folksy, tireless, Maxson spoke endlessly to civic organizations 
of his notion of the symbiosis between university and community. Gradually, the 
Nevada establishment got behind the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson had a kind of Midas touch in Las Vegas, says UNLV Vice President John 
Irsfeld, who was Maxson's deputy for four years before becoming a vice 
president in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one meeting, he said that one of his visions was a program to offer a full 
scholarship program to every valedictorian in the state," Irsfeld says. "After 
the program was over, a middle-aged woman, nicely dressed, not flashy or showy, 
came up to Maxson and said she was really interested in the scholarship idea 
and wanted to know how much it would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "He put his arm around her and said, 'Well, ma'am, it would probably cost $1 
million just to get started.' And she said, 'I think I can do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was Margaret Elardi, owner of a Laughlin casino. The scholarship 
program that she initiated -- and was continued by Elaine Wynn and her husband, 
Steve, chairman of Mirage Resorts -- has been extraordinarily successful. Last 
year, 43 of the state's 56 valedictorians went to UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Maxson left, enrollment at UNLV had doubled, to about 20,000, and 
there were 14 new accredited programs and 28 new degrees, to say nothing of 30 
new buildings and five more in planning. UNLV officials say that under Maxson 
the school raised more than $100 million in private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson's secret is salesmanship, Elaine Wynn says. "Like every good salesman, 
he knows his product and he's responsible for his product," she says. In other 
words, he delivers on his promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people didn't see growth, increased enrollment and elevated quality of 
students and faculty, (the donations) would just dry up," Wynn says. 
</P>
<P>
 The squabbles with Tarkanian may have disenchanted die-hard basketball fans, 
some of whom organized under the banner of Citizens for the Removal of Robert 
Maxson, but the president came out smelling like a rose in the academic 
community, Irsfeld says. 
</P>
<P>
 "About the time he left here," Irsfeld says, "the faculty senate took a poll 
and Maxson got an 82% positive rating. That's pretty good when you consider 
faculties are not given to generosity in judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 The man who brought bona fide higher education to Las Vegas and hopes to 
rejuvenate a battered university in Long Beach is the second son from an 
Arkansas family of cotton farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised in a middle-class family, with wonderful family values and work 
ethic," Maxson says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the farming life was not for him. He went to the University of Arkansas at 
Monticello, earned a bachelor of science degree in education and psychology, 
then became a high school teacher in Florida. One of his students was Sylvia 
Parrish, whom he later began dating. They married in 1965 and have two grown 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The next 19 years saw the Maxsons moving through a succession of positions at 
Southern universities, including two years at Mississippi State University, 
where the couple worked in the federal program to desegregate schools in 
Philadelphia, Miss. Five years earlier, three civil rights workers had been 
murdered there. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife "shared a passion about the civil rights movement," Maxson 
says. "It gave us an opportunity to act on our strong convictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson earned a Ph.D in education from Mississippi State, and, between 1979 
and 1984, became chancellor at the University of Houston's Victoria campus and 
senior vice president for academic affairs. His arrival in Long Beach reunites 
him with CSU Chancellor Barry Munitz, who was chancellor of Houston's main 
campus when Maxson was in Victoria.  
</P>
<P>
 The move to Las Vegas was a big change for Maxson. "I had never lived outside 
of the Deep South before," he says. It was also a bit of a shock to his 
fervently Baptist parents, for whom Las Vegas' reputation was one of excess and 
dissolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my mother I had accepted a job at the University of Nevada," Maxson 
says. "She said, 'Where's that?' When I said it was in Las Vegas, there was 
just a silence at the other end of the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his reputation as an aggressive fund-raiser, Maxson is, by most 
accounts, the epitome of modesty and decorum, displaying a highly developed 
understanding of other people's sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would never say anything around a woman that anyone would have the 
slightest opportunity to call off-color," Irsfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Maxson says that her husband finds it difficult even to tell little 
white lies. "If my daughter is here and the phone is ringing, she might say, 
'Tell them I'm not here,' " she says. "He has a real hard time doing something 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
 But the key to Maxson's personality is his implacable optimism, Irsfeld says. 
"He's the kind of guy who discourages depression," Irsfeld says. "We talked 
about this on several occasions. We'd be up late on recruiting trips and get to 
talking about our early lives. He told me that he had just made up his mind 
when he was young that, to the extent that he was able to do it, he was just 
going to choose to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, there has been little cause for optimism at CSULB. But hard times 
have, in some cases, inspired improvements and constructive acts, Maxson 
insists. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in the absence of state money, the science departments have 
initiated successful fund-raising drives of their own. The chemistry department 
got corporate and private donations to fund most of the $163,000 needed for 
laboratory and office supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only about 10% of our operating expenses comes from the state," said Kenneth 
Marsi, chairman of the chemistry department, 55% of whose graduates go on for 
postgraduate degrees. "We're essentially running a private operation here." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite budget cuts, the School of Business Administration has been able to 
tailor its faculty assignments so that for the first time ever it is 
guaranteeing students seats in all of the courses of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done it with a sort of marketing flair," Maxson says. "I think you'll 
be seeing more of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most important for campus spirit, the Pyramid, the school's new, 
$22-million cobalt-blue athletic center, will be open for the start of the 
men's basketball season on Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intercollegiate athletics are probably our most visible window to the 
public," Maxson said. "It's phenomenally good for the school when it's done 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson's predecessor, Curtis McCray, resigned in March, 1993, to head Millikin 
University, a small liberal arts college in Illinois, after shepherding the 
school through four difficult years. Karl Anatol, provost for academic affairs, 
served as interim president until Maxson's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, the Food Court -- the campus restaurant center -- is 
jammed with students greeting each other with hugs, discussing classwork in 
tight huddles, basking in the morning sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Maxson appears, jacketless, with a man in a dark suit in tow. The 
president shakes a hand here, conducts a quick head-to-head conference there 
and surveys the scene with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feel the energy," he says, turning back to his guest. "This is what it's all 
about." University Enrollment

 Samantha Silva of Long Beach City College will attempt to become the 25th 
woman to swim the Catalina channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, 17, a freshman from Millikan High, will begin the 21-mile swim Sunday 
night from Long Point and is expected to arrive at Cabrillo Beach. If she is 
successful, she will be the 76th swimmer to complete the crossing since 
record-keeping began in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swimming the Catalina channel has been a goal of mine for the past several 
years," said Silva, who swam her first ocean competition, the Seal Beach 
three-mile swim, at age 11. COMMUNITY COLLEGES

ON THE HAMBURGER TRAIL; A SIMPLE BURGER? IN THE WORLD OF FAST FOOD, THERE'S NO 
SUCH THING -- ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF LAST YEAR'S FOOD POISONINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thursday, June 30, North San Diego, Calif.: Jack in the Box decides to promote 
quarter-pound hamburgers in Seattle and Los Angeles during the week of July 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, July 5, North San Diego, Calif.: The purchasing department calculates 
that the promotion will double quarter-pounder sales and places an order with 
SSI Foods Inc., for more than 40,000 pounds of patties. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, July 15, Widmer, Idaho.: Using frozen beef from Australia, fresh beef 
from Idaho ad Western Montana as well as some fresh beef fat from Washington, 
SSI begins forming 920 cases of quarter-pound hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, July 19, Carson, Calif.: Silliker Laboratories receives a sample of 
frozen hamburgers from SSI's Friday production. The lab begins to test for E. 
coli 0157:H7. At the same time Foodmaker begins its own testing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, July 20, Carson, Calif.: All samples of SSI hamburger production 
from the previous Friday are declared clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, July 22, City of Commerce, Calif.: Cases of SSI's frozen hamburgers 
arrive at Foodmaker's distribution center aboard specially equipped freezer 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, July 25, City of Commerce, Calif.: Frozen quarter-pound hamburgers are 
delivered to Jack in the Box restaurants including the North Hollywood location 
on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, July 29, North Hollywood, Calif.: The new shipment of quarter-pound 
Jumbo Jacks are cooked to serve a busy lunch crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Americans -- in a comfortable, familial way -- take hamburgers for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship is not really extended to any other food. Sure, pizza and hot 
dogs are popular. But burger joints are part of the landscape -- much like the 
post office or corner gas station, except much more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even a surge of outbreaks linked to E. coli 0157:H7 bacteria in the last 
21 months -- resulting in more than 700 serious illnesses and four deaths -- 
could slow sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But just what is hamburger? Where does the meat come from? And what is being 
done to prevent a repeat of the E. coli 0157:H7 incident? 
</P>
<P>
 The simple, plain fast-food hamburger is actually the result of a highly 
complex series of processes stretching halfway around the world, involving 
thousands of people, incorporating high science as well as manual labor and 
including meat from hundreds of different animals.  
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of last year's food poisonings, Foodmaker's Jack in the Box chain 
has taken the lead in incorporating the latest safety technology into food 
service. Other chains, such as Taco Bell and McDonalds, are close to 
implementing similar system-wide food safety programs but Foodmaker is the 
acknowledged leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are Foodmaker executives committed to ensuring that this never 
happens again at Jack in the Box but they are also instrumental in working to 
find a complete treatment and cure for E. coli 0157:H7 illnesses," said Bob 
Galler, whose 3-year-old died from the infection and who now heads an E. coli 
victims' support group named after his daughter, the Lois Joy Galler 
Foundation. Foodmaker donated $100,000 to the Galler Foundation last January. 
</P>
<P>
 To trace the story of one burger, The Times was given unlimited access to 
follow how the Jack in the Box chain orders, processes, stores, transports, 
laboratory-tests, cooks and serves its hamburgers. Foodmaker Inc., the parent 
company, made private business documents available; no questions were 
considered out-of-bounds. Suppliers and contractors also cooperated, with one 
exception: The Times could not gain access to one slaughter facility, although 
other, similar facilities were toured. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the story of that "simple" hamburger. Tuesday, July 5, 1994. North San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Foodmaker's North San Diego headquarters has high, almost windowless adobe 
walls and a forbidding aspect; it seems more fortress than the support center 
for 1,175 Jack in the Box family restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also busy. The summer months generate some of the year's heaviest 
customer traffic throughout the chain. Preparations are now being made for a 
special promotion in one of the company's six Western regions.  
</P>
<P>
 The previous Thursday -- June 30 -- the marketing group decided to promote 
quarter-pound burgers for the week of July 25 in a region including Los Angeles 
and Seattle. Today, marketing sends an advertising directive to the purchasing 
director, who puts the necessary food orders through to the inventory 
management group. The two staffs are working several weeks in advance and are 
now focusing on food deliveries for the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack in the Box has the most ambitious menu of the fast-food chains with items 
based on five different cuisines: Japanese, Greek, Mexican, Chinese and 
regional American. But the bestseller has always been hamburgers. Only two 
sizes -- a regular 1.6-ounce and a four-ounce Jumbo Jack patty -- are served. 
</P>
<P>
 The company estimates that stores carrying the Jumbo Jack promotion will 
double their sales of the patty that week. In a regular week, the total sales 
from the 65 stores in the targeted region would amount to more than 10 tons of 
quarter-pound patties. This promotion should bump the figure to an entire 
tractor-trailer load of 160,000 quarter-pound burgers. 
</P>
<P>
 The order is punched into a computer terminal linked by modem to the company's 
distribution centers. A copy is sent via computer network to SSI Food Services 
Inc. in Widmer, Idaho. SSI is one of only two Jack in the Box patty suppliers 
and, while unaware until now of the July 25 promotion, its supplies are in the 
pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, July 6, SSI places its orders to slaughterhouses for enough 
beef to fill the order. Friday, July 15. Widmer, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 SSI Foods Inc.'s beef processing facility operates in a world of cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the blistering summer heat, the plant's temperatures are kept at 40 
degrees or below in work areas and sub-zero in freezers. You never know what 
season it is outside the building because inside it is always uniformly, 
bone-chilling cold. 
</P>
<P>
 To stay warm and optimize sanitation, employees are dressed in bulky white 
coveralls, nets for head and even facial hair, hard hats and thick gloves. Some 
wear protective goggles. 
</P>
<P>
 Once every 24 hours, the entire plant is completely disassembled and cleaned 
with soap and hot water, then sanitized with a chlorine-based solution. On-site 
USDA inspectors then check for any sanitary deficiencies before the plant can 
restart production. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look: This is a clean plant," SSI President Kirk Smith insists, pointing to 
stainless-steel equipment that shimmers in the artificial fluorescent light. 
"We make the best product possible. In this business, if garbage comes in the 
door then garbage goes out the door. There is no garbage here." 
</P>
<P>
 In slaughterhouses in Australia, Idaho and Washington state, beef carcasses 
have been butchered in the traditional manner: the leanest meat placed in one 
container; prime cuts sent in another direction, and pure fat placed into 
other, specific boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 At SSI, lean beef and pure fat -- which could be from different ranches, 
states, regions or even countries -- are ground together to a customer's 
specifications and then formed into that familiar round patty. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarter-pound patties being blended by SSI today include meat that is 50% 
lean from the Monfort Co., just down the road in Nampa, Idaho, and meat that is 
90% lean shipped in from New South Wales, Australia. If necessary, and it 
usually is, fresh beef fat from Iowa Beef Processors in Pasco, Wash., is used 
to obtain the target of 26% fat in the quarter-pound patty. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual mixture of this Jack in the Box order will be about 40% American 
beef and 60% Australian beef. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the American beef came from Monfort, a division of food giant Con 
Agra, which culls from ranches within a 200-square-mile area including the 
southwest corner of Idaho, Eastern Oregon, Washington and western Montana. The 
plant handles between 700 and 1,000 head per day. For this Jack in the Box 
order, the beef is from cattle on ranches in Idaho and western Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 After the animals were stunned, bled, skinned, gutted and chilled, Monfort 
sent the beef carcasses through its processing line for butchering. Meat was 
separated manually by an army of butchers and meat cutters. Then Monfort 
trucked the beef in 2,000-pound combo bins up Interstate 84 to SSI to be 
blended into hamburger patties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian beef comes from a large shipment of frozen beef SSI received by 
ocean freighter on June 24 in Oakland. The 2,000-pound bins were then 
transported to Widmer, about an hour north of Boise. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Theno, Foodmaker's vice president for quality assurance and product 
safety, says the Australians make an excellent product that is less expensive, 
even with shipping costs, than similar-quality American meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian beef is a product of Lackley Ltd., a New South Wales-based 
company. The Aussie cattle were slaughtered in Macksville on May 30, or more 
than a month before Jack in the Box corporate officials decided to promote 
quarter-pound hamburgers. (SSI has a standing order for about one million 
pounds of Australia beef per week for Jack in the Box and other clients.)  
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how cold and clean SSI's plant is, you can't tell whether 
harmful organisms are present. Ironically, neither can USDA employees in the 
current federal meat inspection program, who rely on sight, scent and touch to 
identify these invisible threats. In fact, detection of the organisms in 
question requires extensive microbiological testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, SSI operates its own state-of-art laboratory. Neither the in-house lab 
nor independent outside laboratories have ever found E. coli 0157:H7 in SSI 
beef. Monfort has even tested cattle manure looking for E. coli traces but none 
have been found, says Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, three samples are taken from each tractor-trailer load of meat or fat 
that is delivered to SSI for further analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1993 E. coli contamination, Jack in the Box has changed hamburger 
sources. Foodmaker's new policy is strict: If a processor's ground meat tests 
positive for the bacteria more than once, that firm is dropped from the supply 
system. Any product that contains the harmful bacteria, and there have been 
several, is destroyed, Theno says. Tuesday, July 19, 1994. Carson, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 The human body provides the ideal breeding ground for E. coli 0157:H7 -- the 
organism thrives at about 98 degrees, or average body temperature. Once 
ingested, there is nothing to stop its growth and treatment is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of E. coli's ecology that isn't understood," says Foodmaker's 
Theno. "It is a single cell, simple organism that needs more research. What we 
do know is that 90% of the E. coli cells that may be present in meat, for 
instance, will tolerate freezing temperatures well and just become dormant 
(until thawed)." 
</P>
<P>
 It is no longer enough for Jack in the Box that Monfort has lab-tested cattle 
manure, or that one of its slaughterhouses conducts microbiological surveys on 
each day's production, or that SSI tests both incoming and outgoing meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, every shipment of hamburgers destined for Jack in the Box restaurants is 
placed on hold while Silliker Laboratories of California Inc., located in 
Carson, tests a representative sample for E. coli 0157:H7. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure can take between one and six days, depending on whether any of 
the contaminant is present. Nothing leaves SSI or the other processors until 
the samples have been declared clean by Silliker. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing procedure is done in two steps. The first, which can be completed 
within 26 to 28 hours, can tell only whether the general family of E. coli 
organisms -- which are common in the intestines of both humans and animals -- 
are present. If any organisms are detected, an additional five days of 
complicated microbiological testing determines whether the bacteria are the 
harmful variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Silliker tests ground beef for a number of clients in addition to Jack in the 
Box. The lab says it's getting positives on the first test once or twice a 
month and finding the potentially fatal E. coli 0157:H7 once every four months. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday afternoon, July 19, Silliker informs Foodmaker that SSI's Friday 
production of quarter-pound patties is clean. Wednesday, July 20, 1994. North 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time Silliker is running the E. coli tests, Foodmaker's own 
Quality Assurance Laboratory is also testing the hamburgers from the previous 
Friday's production at SSI. Technicians will determine whether the patties meet 
the chain's physical, chemical and microbiological specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best line of defense is to make sure the thing is cooked properly," says 
Theno. "A problem or glitch could arise because of the wrong weight, shape or 
size. You can learn that just by cooking." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, two lab technicians are cooking three regular-size hamburger 
patties according to Jack in the Box procedures. Cooking temperatures and times 
are monitored by computer. Once cooked, the burgers are taken off the grill and 
checked for thorough cooking. The patties are torn apart to make sure that no 
pink, uncooked beef remains, a color change that occurs at about 155 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Having experienced the trauma of a food poisoning outbreak that may have been 
caused by improper cooking, Foodmaker has become extremely attentive to the 
issue. The company and an independent manufacturer jointly developed a 
specially designed thermo-probe that is sensitive enough to get an 
instantaneous heat reading in the different parts of the thin hamburger meat. 
</P>
<P>
 After quickly analyzing the three samples both visually and with the 
thermo-probe, the lab tech announces, "everything is cooked." Friday, July 22, 
1994. City of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to following long-standing safety practices, every refrigerated 
tractor-trailer that unloads at Foodmaker's giant warehouse in Commerce carries 
a vital piece of equipment. Drivers check to see that the seal on the trailer's 
door is intact and that the refrigeration equipment is working. They also check 
the load's temperature. Most importantly, the driver and the warehouse 
supervisor inspect the Stires Temperature Recorder, the equivalent of the black 
box on a commercial airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stires keeps a constant record of the internal temperature of the trailer 
for as many as eight days. Soon after going to work for Jack in the Box, Theno 
required that all trucks carry it. 
</P>
<P>
 "One year ago we would do a visual inspection of the truck and a temperature 
check upon arrival but we wouldn't know what happened inside the trailer in 
Arizona or New Mexico. Now we do," says Les Gardner, distribution center 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Foodmaker requires that trucks maintain a temperature of less than 10 degrees 
but prefers the level to remain around zero. A few readings blip upward toward 
10 degrees on the Stires printout for this meat delivery, but all else looks 
good and the truck can be unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Another set of checks begins when Foodmaker delivers patties to the 
restaurants in its own fleet of trucks. Again, the Foodmaker trailers are 
equipped with Stires temperature recorders or an on-board computer that records 
the trailer's temperature.  
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Monday, July 25, the warehouse will deliver the SSI hamburgers. From 
the Commerce warehouse, 440 Jack in the Box restaurants are supplied throughout 
Southern California, Las Vegas and the Colorado River resort area. 
</P>
<P>
 Foodmaker drivers have only 20 minutes to unload their trucks into the 
individual store's freezers. Friday, July 29, 1994. Laurel Canyon Boulevard, 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch is always the busiest time for fast-food restaurants. Today at the Jack 
in the Box in North Hollywood is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a fast-moving line of cars at the drive-up window. Inside, workers on 
lunch break crowd the counter to order. Families of four sit at tables, their 
plastic trays brimming with paper-wrapped hamburgers, large drinks and French 
fries. The place hums with conversation and laughter. Even an LAPD squad car 
swoops in for a quick stop at the drive-up window. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one months ago, this particular restaurant could have been giving away 
food and not found any takers, but time has dimmed memories of the E. coli 
0157:H7 episode.  
</P>
<P>
 The number of guests eating here is not the only difference. The kitchen has 
been compartmentalized to separate raw foods from cooked, ready-to-eat items. 
No one ever touches an uncooked hamburger at Jack in the Box. All are carefully 
handled with utensils. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack in the Box cooks its hamburgers from frozen patties to eliminate 
guesswork about thawing times, because they are easier to handle and because 
there are no meat juices present that can spread contamination. The cook places 
a quarter-pounder on the 375-degree grill and hits a timer. After a few 
minutes, an overhead digital monitor sounds a sharp alarm, directing the cook 
to flip the burger. It sounds again when the burger has finished cooking.  
</P>
<P>
 The final cooking phase is called the quality flip: The cook turns the patty a 
second time, notches the center with a spatula and makes sure the meat is 
cooked to a brown color throughout. If there is any pink, the burger remains on 
the grill until done. The chain will not serve burgers cooked rare or 
medium-rare.  
</P>
<P>
 The backbone of the Jack in the Box system is a food safety program developed 
by industry food scientists and called Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point 
or HACCP. The program here is represented by series of checklists and reports 
completed by employees as often as once each six-hour shift. Most extensive is 
the HACCP shift checklist, which identifies 33 critical points throughout the 
restaurant that need to be inspected by the manager.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the shift checklist, temperatures of all cooking surfaces must 
be taken twice daily. Another weekly checklist is also required of each 
restaurant, with 54 areas that need review. The weekly list is comparable to 
those used by local health inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a team of company auditors visits the restaurants about once a month 
with its own checklist to make sure each Jack in the Box is operating at 
optimum sanitation and is accurately completing the HACCP checklists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've spent a lot of time in the field traveling to many of our restaurants, 
and I can now say that we have a darned good food safety system," says 
Foodmaker's Theno. "We also believe that we can give something back to our 
industry, and we will share the results of our program at scientific gatherings 
and other industry meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "HACCP (had never been) designed for quick-serve restaurants. It was more 
suited to slaughterhouses and meat processing plants. There has never been this 
kind of safety system for restaurants, and I can now say that it is do-able. 
When we show this to the rest of the industry, it will turn on a light for a 
lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the hamburger that began its journey several weeks before and 
thousands of miles away? It was simple and good. More importantly, there was 
every reason to believe it was safe.
