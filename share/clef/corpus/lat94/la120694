for "Beauty" are $25 to $65 with a $5 discount for preview performances March 
21-April 11. Official opening is April 13.

 Lloyd Webber Ill: Meanwhile, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer of "Phantom," 
"Cats" and "Sunset Boulevard," was being treated for an ulcerative esophagus, 
his spokesman in London said Monday. The 46-year-old composer was hospitalized 
in England Friday after returning from New York, where his latest hit, "Sunset 
Boulevard" starring Glenn Close, opened to rave reviews. Lloyd Webber is being 
fed intravenously and is expected to recover within a few weeks, the spokesman 
said. Added Lloyd Webber, in a statement: "It is just the case of sitting 
around with a tube in my arm until I can have my first consomme."

 Stepping Up: Sherry Glaser's one-woman "Family Secrets" will return to 
Southern California in big venues next year, playing the McCallum Theatre in 
Palm Desert Feb. 2-5 and the Henry Fonda Theatre in Hollywood Feb. 8-March 12. 
The show previously played two sub-100-seat sites in Los Angeles, enjoying a 
long 1990-91 run at the Heliotrope (now the Deaf West). It also played in San 
Diego and Orange County, then went on to open Off Broadway in late 1993 and 
will close there Jan. 1. The run at the 863-seat Fonda is scheduled to reopen 
the theater after repairs from the Jan. 17 earthquake. MOVIES

 'Diabolique' Redux: Actress Sharon Stone has a $6-million deal to star in an 
American remake of the classic 1955 French chiller "Diabolique," which starred 
the late Simone Signoret. Stone, whose box-office appeal is strong in Europe, 
will play the vengeful mistress who, along with a long-suffering wife, plots to 
bump off a tyrannical lover only to discover that they may have botched the 
job. Earlier, Warner Bros. had refused to pay Stone more than $4 million for 
the role, but the actress got her price when the film's financing was taken 
over by Morgan Creek Productions. Morgan Creek even agreed to throw in a 
$100,000 makeup trailer. "She spends half the day (during filming) in the 
makeup trailer, doing her hair, makeup and retouching, so it makes sense," said 
her manager, Chuck Binder. "We like to make each deal different." The film is 
being written by Don Roos and is to be directed by Jeremiah Chechik ("Benny & 
Joon"). It will be produced now by Morgan Creek's James Robinson along with 
Marvin Worth.

 Sundance Kickoff: "Before Sunrise," a romance starring Ethan Hawke and Julie 
Delpy and directed by Richard Linklater ("Slacker," "Dazed and Confused"), will 
open the 1995 Sundance Film Festival with a world premiere screening in Salt 
Lake City on Jan. 19, festival organizers said. The 10-day festival then moves 
to Park City where more than 150 films and documentaries will be shown, many 
for the first time. Among those highly anticipated but, like "Sunrise," not 
competing for awards: "My Family" with Edward James Olmos and Jimmy Smits; 
"Miami Rhapsody," starring Sarah Jessica Parker, Antonio Banderas, Mia Farrow 
and Paul Mazursky; and "The Basketball Diaries," featuring Leonardo DiCaprio.

 NBC Nabs Spielberg Epics: Director Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" and 
"Schindler's List" will receive early broadcast runs on NBC as the result of a 
unique $50-million deal with Universal and Amblin Television, an NBC source 
confirmed Monday. "Jurassic Park," which has grossed more money worldwide than 
any film in box-office history, is expected to hit pay-per-view in February and 
then bypass a premium cable channel in order to air on NBC. "Schindler's List," 
named best picture of 1993 at the Academy Awards in March, will run on the 
small premium cable service Starz! in January and then move over to the 
network. NBC's deal reportedly includes two airings of "Schindler's List" and 
multiple airings of "Jurassic Park." Both films are available on videocassette.

JAZZ REVIEW; MARTIN AND FRIENDS DISPLAY FIRST-CLASS SKILLS AT BAKERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mel Martin did one thing absolutely right Friday night. He hired a first-class 
rhythm section, featuring Kenny Barron on piano, Tootie Heath on drums and John 
Heard on bass, for a two-night gig at the Jazz Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Martin -- a tenor saxophonist best known for his work with the 
group Bebop and Beyond -- was well aware that the presence of the estimable 
Barron on stage might easily eclipse his own playing. And, to a large extent, 
it did. But Martin is a solid, workmanlike improviser with a facile technique, 
a firm rhythmic feel and a vivid harmonic vision. If he was not the most 
fascinating artist in the ensemble, there was no faulting the sheer enthusiasm 
he brought to his soloing, notably so during an intensely interactive duet with 
Barron on Benny Carter's "People Time." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the musical focus of the set clearly rested on Barron, who has evolved 
in the last few years from a ubiquitous rhythm-section player to one of the 
most imaginative pianists in contemporary jazz. Each solo he played -- from 
Martin's racehorse up-tempo originals to more lyrical ballads -- became an 
extraordinary set piece in and of itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Immensely abetted by Heath's attentive support, Barron approached his 
instrument with the visual acumen of a painter. Quick and virtuosic though he 
may be, his remarkably fast fingers never dwelt on mechanics alone, producing 
instead surging flashes of bright, musical color. His touch on slower tunes was 
exquisite, rich and dense with suggestive textures, very much in a class with 
such superb harmonic pianists as Hank Jones and Bill Evans. And his rhythmic 
presentation, always swinging, added a structural unity to everything -- the 
kind of instant, improvisational composition so typical of Art Tatum. 
</P>
<P>
 Heath's percussive examination of a Dizzy Gillespie line, "Diddly, Wah Diddy," 
matched Barron's adventurous pursuit of sound. Using hands, sticks, African 
drums and every part of his regular kit, he proved, as he so often does, that 
drummers don't have to be bashers. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin seemed to enjoy every minute of playing by his sterling back-up group. 
Generous with his limited performing time, he found a way to showcase their 
skills without minimizing his own considerable abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Barron also appears at Ambassador Auditorium on Wednesday at 8 p.m. in a 
concert with four other gifted pianists. Ambassador Auditorium, 300 W. Green 
St. Pasadena. (800) 266-2378. Tickets: $22.50 - $25.50.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; GALAS, JONES TAKE A SONIC LOOK AT ROMANTIC OBSESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed in you, and I don't handle disappointment well. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Those words, which came early in Diamanda Galas and John Paul Jones' Wadsworth 
Theater concert on Sunday, are among the last you'd want to be on the receiving 
end of. They're addressed to a husband who might understandably wish to be on 
his way, but can find no escape from this implacable bride and the 
claustrophobic sonic prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Galas, long a key force in the world of avant-garde music, has swooped down 
like an avenging angel from the realm of high art into the hard ground of rock 
'n' roll, hooking up with Led Zeppelin co-founder Jones and bringing her 
astonishing, opera-from-hell vocal technique to bear on themes of romantic 
obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 Their collaborative album is "The Sporting Life," a collection of what they 
call "homicidal love songs." The battle of the sexes doesn't get much bloodier 
than it does in the course of its 10 songs. 
</P>
<P>
 A vision this relentlessly pure and individual makes everything else seem like 
playtime, and in moving to the pop-music stage on Sunday Galas didn't loosen 
the fundamental rigor of her art. She did adopt the stances and duds of the 
rock performer, though, and she capitalized on the form's immediacy and the 
songs' relative accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't as profoundly moving and constantly compelling as the theatrical 
"Plague Mass" she mounted last year, but it was fun to hear her deliver 
monologues with the cadences of a soul singer's sassy spoken interludes. Her 
serrated timbre often tightened into a voice much like Tina Turner's, and R&B's 
gliding vocal embellishments were child's play to a singer with her control. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who produced the album and co-wrote some of the songs, looked placid 
and bemused as he hung back and thunked away on a variety of basses, locking in 
with drummer Denny Fongheiser for an elemental and inevitably Zeppelinesque 
foundation -- especially on the encore, Zep's "Communication Breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
 It's amazing how much music this configuration emitted. But there's no need 
for a lead guitarist when there's a veritable Jimmy Page in the singer's 
throat.

DANCE REVIEW; HAYASTAN ENSEMBLE SPINS A FOLK MOSAIC SPECTACLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Hayastan Dance Ensemble, which made its professional debut at Ambassador 
Auditorium this weekend, is a theatricalized folk dance group in the mold of 
Russia's Moiseyev troupe. In fact, Hayastan's founder in 1988 was the late 
Iosif Izrailov, who trained under Moiseyev before starting his own company 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday afternoon, about 40 dancers and musicians of mainly Armenian descent 
hit the hallmarks of Eastern European folk mosaic spectacle, often excelling at 
exciting athletic maneuvers in Georgian or Russian dances and delicate 
wreathing ballets of hands and arms in Armenian dances. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the province of the women was slow grace and decorous parading or 
flirting, while martial, virtuosic moves belonged to men. Although folk 
ensembles like this one have moved with the times enough to incorporate gold 
lame, ballet steps and modern choreographic strategies, the strictly 
conventional gender roles never budge. 
</P>
<P>
 Gravity, on the other hand, was dealt a blow each time guest performers Temur 
Koridze and Badri Esatia flew onstage with split jumps, bounding turns and 
Georgian "toe dancing." Other male soloists joined in the tasks of shooting the 
legs up in many directions from a crouched position and crossing the stage in 
impressive knee-to-floor swaggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians onstage provided excellent accompaniment and solos, but tape was 
used for the overwrought, under-thought-out "The Gypsies." Demonstrating a 
primary danger in reducing ethnic groups to danced essences, women shimmied, 
and men raged -- simplistically and insultingly. 
</P>
<P>
 In so-called traditional dancing, traditions are chosen for perpetuation every 
step of the way. Hayastan may want to reconsider that one.JENNIFER FISHER

 The three Canadian stars of Nickelodeon's "The Elephant Show," dressed in 
turn-of-the-century costume, take viewers on a colorful, theatrical train ride 
in the snow, with song-and-dance production numbers and a strategic stop at an 
abandoned train station to find the holiday spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 The adventure is well-produced, with a polished mix of swing, sentiment and 
comic nonsense for family appeal. The harmonizing trio has never been more 
engaging than in this collection of old favorites, traditional holiday tunes

 Moral to the Story: Celebrating the joy of giving are two very modestly 
animated, but sweet 25-minute offerings about friendship. In "Madeline and the 
Toy Factory," the latest chapter in the continuing saga about the little French 
schoolgirl, based on Ludwig Bemelmans' books and narrated by Christopher 
Plummer, Madeline pretends to be a doll and makes a lonely child happy. In "The 
Poky Little Puppy's First Christmas," narrated by Donald Sutherland, the 
playful pup discovers the meaning of Christmas when he helps a homeless little 
skunk named Herman.

 Before He's a Hound: If a real canine is on your gift list, don't miss 
"Puppies!," a charmingly filmed, informative look at several popular breeds, 
from Chihuahuas to Irish wolfhounds, with tips on temperament and care 
requirements -- which dogs do best with little children, how much room they 
need, how much grooming and just how big that cute little bundle of fluff will 
get. Narrated by Powers Boothe, with input from veterinarians and national 
breed associations, it's a helpful, entertaining place to begin your search for 
the perfect pup.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; EXPLORING UNKNOWN TERRITORIES OF LOVE AND NEW YORK; SOME 
GIRLS BY KRISTIN MCCLOY ; DUTTON $20.95, 320 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACEY LEVINE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A simple tale can be made fresh and unique only when a writer brings his or 
her most feverish ideas and commitments to it. Love stories, when not set 
against a political backdrop, all have a way of being the same unless there is 
a strong subjectivity to make them special. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin McCloy, a young writer who lives in Los Angeles and grew up overseas, 
won praise in 1989 for her first novel, "Velocity," a compelling story of an 
educated young woman locked into an obsessive sexual relationship with an 
inarticulate biker. It is her slow fascination with the man's sexuality and her 
single-mindedness about him that stitch the book together and give it its 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 In her second novel, McCloy works a more ambitious, detailed plot, but "Some 
Girls" does not have the same earthy bite as "Velocity." This novel, which 
feels less unified than her first, tells the story of 23-year-old Claire 
Stearn, who has left her hometown, a family still suffering from an old 
divorce, and a sullen, hickish boyfriend for New York. Drawn into friendship 
with her neighbor, Jade, she must decide whether to return to familiar 
Alamogordo, or delve into unknown, uncertain territory with Jade, as a romance 
ensues. 
</P>
<P>
 McCloy's prose style, with its fragmentary phrases and sentences fused 
together by commas, has a quiet, coursing internal voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some Girls" is full of salty, steamy, foody descriptions of New York's 
Chinatown and tiny candle-lighted West Village restaurants, of bracing Atlantic 
weather at Jones Beach, of a trip to an emerald cove in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in spite of these strong points of favor, "Some Girls," overall, is 
unconvincing fiction, uncomplicated enough to be a formula youth novel, albeit 
with sexual themes thrown in. A blueprint for a sweetly sappy screenplay, with 
its numerous locales and rapid sequences of scenes, the book attempts to revamp 
the small-town-kid-comes-to-the-big-city with lesbian exoticism, but 
regrettably, the reader does not feel the characters and their concerns so much 
as merely watch them pass by on the page. 
</P>
<P>
 The anarchic excitement of New York seen through a newcomer's eyes, a major 
part of this narrative, is frequently flat, with its sketches of staple New 
Yorkers drawn in almost embarrassing cliches -- the pidgin of cab drivers and 
shopkeepers is rendered impetuously, gracelessly, and fails to convey the 
quirky energy that real people have. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is Jade, the friend who becomes a lover, portrayed very convincingly. 
McCloy wants to make her an unfathomably mysterious and sultry, worldly, 
rarefied creature who works a shady job and maintains a constant elegance 
before Claire's admiring eyes. But who is really like this? The book offers 
little in the way of grounding Jade, or other characters, in any sort of 
depthful emotional rubric, though in a novel of this sort, that is what we 
would expect. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Jade is also hardened and disillusioned, her intense, immediate 
attachment to the clean-cut Claire is ill-explained. It's hard to believe that 
someone with Jade's sophistication would enter a love affair with the ingenue 
Claire without having some distance on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the explanation lies in the statement that Jade makes to Claire while 
the two are high on peyote: "I've known you for eons. . . . I knew when I met 
you that we had a past. . . . People find each other, they pick up where they 
left off. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 As the novel goes on, the feel of formula fiction waxes, and Claire's naivete 
becomes just too silly to swallow. She interviews for a job with an attorney, 
Sam, who is characterized in terms of his nice sweaters, warm handshake and 
paternal concern. His office is "warm, like a room in somebody's house, the 
walls lined with books. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Just like in the movies, Sam offers her the job on the spot, favoring her over 
the other jealous secretaries, and ludicrously, at the end of her first day of 
work, he requests that she be his paralegal on a civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 One gets the feeling that these scenes appear only to fill pages, to satisfy 
the author's notion of what a plot should include. It isn't that McCloy doesn't 
have what it takes, for this book contains many fruitful scenes, and some 
especially sharp dialogue. Indeed, she seems to have a talent for conveying the 
pain of alcohol-soaked domestic rifts without being melodramatic -- this is 
clear in both "Velocity" and "Some Girls." 
</P>
<P>
 In vivid moments in the novel, McCloy seems truest to herself as a fiction 
writer, describing events in a felt, internal manner rather than laying out 
scenes for the sake of a plot, which commandeers the narrative. Her prose in 
itself is satisfying, and with it McCloy accomplishes much, but ultimately, 
"Some Girls" is not unique enough to make its urban love story worthwhile.

 The Scene: Thursday's party hosted by the New Yorker magazine at Dennis 
Hopper's house for contributing editor and artist Art Spiegelman. The 
cartoonist, who won a Pulitzer Prize special award for his Holocaust-based book 
"Maus," has illustrated Joseph Moncure March's 1928 novel-in-verse, "The Wild 
Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I wanted to do something that was anti-'Maus,' something 
antithetical," said the chain-smoking Spiegelman. "Something that was erotic, 
something decorative. This has no redeeming social value. Its got a good beat 
and you can dance to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Spiegelman, Hopper (wearing a black Fedora upon the head he 
shaved for "Waterworld"), and an eclectic, 200-strong crowd that included 
artists Ed Ruscha, Chuck Arnoldi, Robert Graham, Billy Al Bengston, George 
Herms and Ed Moses; actors Victoria Duffy (who lives with Hopper), Jennifer 
Tilly, Leonard Nimoy, Julie Delpy and Samantha Mathis; plus Roger Corman, Bruce 
Feldman, Doug Cramer, Richard and Betty Koshalek, Graham Nash, Dwight Yoakam, 
Angela Janklow and Matt Groening, who said: "If anyone in cartooning is 
actually making these messy doodles into art, it's Art Spiegelman." 
</P>
<P>
 The House: The two-story, windowless, sky-lit structure in a 
not-ready-for-gentrification part of Venice has a corrugated-steel facade. It 
was designed by architect Brian Murphy, who dubbed the style "paramilitary 
suburban." Entry is through a sound stage/screening room that opens onto an 
art-filled gallery hall. Upstairs are the living quarters. Since the downstairs 
rooms connect through walls with roll-up garage doors (so art can be delivered 
by truck), it's devised as a drive-through house. 
</P>
<P>
 The Art: This was the real star of the evening. The house is essentially an 
art gallery someone lives in. "It's a shell to house art," Murphy said. "Dennis 
is someone who does nothing in moderation and he collects art with the same 
passion."  
</P>
<P>
 Observed: Hopper, looking admiringly at a wall of his art collection, said: 
"This has survived many divorces."

THEATER REVIEW; ADDING RELEVANCE TO 'MACHINE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone familiar with recent headlines who catches "The Adding Machine" at Cal 
State Fullerton might conclude that it was written only the other day, and with 
Orange County in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the first act, Mr. and Mrs. Zero throw a cocktail party for 
their circle of suburban friends -- the Ones, Twos, Threes and so on. The 
social chit-chat seems a properly alarmed reaction to last week's staggering 
revelation of Citron's Folly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look for a big smash-up in about three months," says Mr. Three. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't surprise me a bit," Mr. Two replies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sure headin' for trouble," says Mr. One. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, these interchangeable suburbanites are not discussing the county's 
wrong-way investment fund and its $1.5 billion in paper losses due to 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's bad guess on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although these folks are worried about their pocketbooks, they blame their 
anxiety on something closer to the bone -- just like the majority of California 
voters who passed Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreign agitators, that's what it is," says Mr. Four. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ought to be run outa the country," Mr. Three replies. 
</P>
<P>
 "America for the Americans is what I say," says Mr. Six. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's it!" they agree in unison. "Damn foreigners! Jail 'em! Shoot 'em! Hang 
'em! Lynch 'em! Burn 'em!" 
</P>
<P>
 Patriots all, they and their wives break into song: "My country 'tis of thee, 
sweet land of liberty." 
</P>
<P>
 Elmer Rice, who wrote "The Adding Machine," never heard of Prop. 187. He died 
27 years ago, having written this Expressionist satire long before then. The 
original production ran on Broadway in 1923, during an era fondly remembered as 
the Jazz Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, we tend to forget the period's darker aspects. The Jazz Age ushered in 
restrictive immigration quotas as the law of the land, saw a resurgence in the 
Ku Klux Klan and marked the advent of modern regimentation as a hallmark of new 
technological society. 
</P>
<P>
 But what makes "The Adding Machine" seem more pertinent than ever -- and far 
more fresh in tone than much of the writing itself -- is the crisp, imaginative 
staging dreamed up by director Meredith Wright. She and her designers have 
delivered a smart revival of this rarely seen play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Outsize props and skewed scenic elements establish the exaggerated ambience of 
a cartoon. Brisk set changes are choreographed with witty theatrical style, 
incorporating them into the cast's performance while enhancing the mood of 
futuristic automation. The costumes are full of bright ideas. And a compelling 
sound design has all the bells and whistles, both literal and symbolic (factory 
horns, ticking clocks, heart beats). 
</P>
<P>
 None of that would go anywhere, though, without the clever, funny lead 
performance of Mark John Packer as Mr. Zero, a timid, lecherous, white-collar 
drone who does nothing but count numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Packer breathes life into the role with some priceless touches. Rail-thin and 
meek-looking, he gives the perfect impression of a born clerk. His Mr. Zero has 
a bald pate with a monk's fringe of hair, small mustache and receding chin. And 
he exhibits the manner of someone who is simultaneously obsequious and 
resentful. 
</P>
<P>
 He also puts unexpected humor into his portrait. In a graveyard scene, Packer 
climbs out of Mr. Zero's coffin with an expression of giddy bewilderment. He 
doesn't know whether he's dead or alive, and his stiff-legged gait is a droll 
piece of acting: It communicates exactly how a corpse must feel the first time 
he stands up. 
</P>
<P>
 Paris Bradstreet weighs in with a solid supporting performance as the shrewish 
Mrs. Zero and doubles nicely as the Judge. Leslie Mitts lends a bit of pathos 
to Mr. Zero's would-be girlfriend, Daisy. Many in the large cast play multiple 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything works. "The Adding Machine" has dialogue that becomes 
repetitive and scenes that sometimes go on too long. Those problems are less 
apparent in the first act, where the satire has bite. But in the second, where 
the script softens and turns sentimental, the tempo begins to lag. 
</P>
<P>
 A scene in paradise bogs down, for instance, despite an attempt to sharpen it 
with musical burlesque. Unfortunately, adding Tchaikovsky's "Waltz of the 
Flowers" to the end of the scene merely extends it -- one of Wright's few 
missteps in this high-concept production. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, though "The Adding Machine" has never entered the standard repertory 
and could use some editing, it clearly leaps across the years with the help of 
a revival as ambitious as this one.

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the distinctive red hourglass pattern on her underside, the black widow 
spider is readily recognizable to most Southern Californians. A new exhibit at 
the Palm Springs Desert Museum sheds some light on this creature.  
</P>
<P>
 "Black Widow" includes live specimens, giant models, graphic panels and video 
displays to answer questions about the spider's life and habits. Children can 
gaze through a microscope at the fang of a black widow, its web and the tiny 
combs on its legs that it uses to tie up its prey. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults can view the informational panels that describe the danger of the 
spider's venom, the kinds of food it consumes and how the female acquired the 
moniker of "widow." Of particular interest are statistics on the danger from 
black widows, compared to other natural dangers. The exhibit runs through Feb. 
12. Call (619) 325-7186.

 City overhaul: The good news: Floors four through 27 of City Hall will be shut 
down over the next several months for earthquake renovation. The bad news: The 
mayor and the City Council are housed on the third floor, which is considered 
structurally safe, if not fiscally so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The national pastime (closed): The Short Stop, a Sunset Boulevard bar, has 
taken sarcastic note of the baseball strike, trumpeting the availability of a 
stadium once used by a team called the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Set 'em up, Joe: Incidentally, the Short Stop, long known as a cop joint, has 
provided material for a couple of novels by Joseph Wambaugh, the bard of the 
black and whites. In "Delta Star" (1983), it's called The House of Misery -- 
"dark, as every cop's bar must be (they don't want to see too much when they're 
off duty)," with a dance floor "exactly the size of three coffins," and 
outrageous bumper stickers "that said, 'Our Cops Eat Their Dead.' Or 'Conan the 
Barbarian for Police Chief. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the most dramatic scene in the bar, a drunken police dog named Ludwig, who 
has "goat-like eyes" of amber yellow, commandeers a pool table and refuses to 
surrender it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in "Fugitive Nights" (1992), Wambaugh tells a tale associated with a 
Short Stop bumper sticker of years ago (though he transplants the locale to 
Palm Springs). 
</P>
<P>
 The bumper sticker, so the story goes, referred to a holdup by a man who 
appeared to have a gun under his coat. What the intruder didn't realize was 
that half the rumpled guys hunched over drinks at the bar were plainclothes 
cops. One of them shot him to death. And afterward it was discovered that the 
dead man was holding a plastic object. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the bumper sticker: "Use a Comb, Go to Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without a song: Despite numerous contests and thousands of entries over the 
years, L.A. still has no official song. Perhaps it will be "Los Angeles, My Los 
Angeles," by Rudy Kovar, who recently unveiled his composition in a full-page 
ad in Variety. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the tale of a would-be actor who gets off to a rocky start here: 
</P>
<P>
 At night I walk the Boulevard of Terror.  
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Anas blowin' in my soul.  
</P>
<P>
 I slept in gutters. Traded bullets all for sick lies.  
</P>
<P>
 O God the angels cried from Planetarium skies.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry -- the song has a happy ending. And Kovar hopes for a bit of good 
luck himself. His ad carried the tag line: "Looking for the right singer. 
Looking for the right motion picture." miscelLAny Petco and PetsMart are asking 
customers not to forget the homeless -- the homeless animal population, that 
is. Those stores have set out barrels to collect trinkets, which will be 
donated to local animal shelters. Perhaps the city could arrange to have a big 
party for the critters at empty Dodger Stadium.

AL MARTINEZ: CONSIDERING THE GODZILLA OF TORTILLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Venema is the kind of publicist who can convince you that the unveiling 
of a tortilla machine is nothing less momentous than the day Jesus was seen 
shopping for hot-pot holders at Pic 'N' Save. 
</P>
<P>
 He uses phrases like "I feel this in my heart" to hint that the machine might 
be the very implement needed to revive the national economy, reduce 
unemployment and communicate with creatures living beyond the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call it Godzilla," he said, preparing to lead me into the large, 
cavernous room where the Amazing Tortilla Machine lurked. 
</P>
<P>
 We were at the factory of a company called La Tapatia, which is a term to 
describe someone who lives in Guadalajara, although the factory is in Compton. 
I'm not sure why they named it that. I have been to both places. Trust me when 
I say they have nothing in common. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not here, however, to trash communities, but to introduce you to Mega 
Press, the largest, fastest, most efficient tortilla-making machine in the 
world. I know this for a fact. Mike Venema felt it in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 How fast is the Mega Press, a.k.a. Godzilla? Well, if all the tortillas 
produced by the Amazing Machine in a 24-hour period were laid end to end, they 
would stretch from Valencia to Mission Viejo, a distance of 76.8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 If you tippy-toed along it like Dorothy on her way to the Emerald City, you 
would be sashaying atop 576,000 delicious, eight-inch flour tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Gulp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a slow day when Venema felt it in his heart to contact me about 
Godzilla. The Heidi Fleiss trial had reached a predictable conclusion, the O.J. 
Simpson trial was continuing to simultaneously bore and fascinate millions, and 
Roseanne had not married, divorced or cursed anyone in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 I was therefore susceptible to new ideas in my continuing effort to define 
L.A. A giant tortilla machine seemed at the time to fit into the wider scheme 
of things. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something almost cosmic about a single machine that, by next May, 
will have produced 100 million tortillas. It is a concept larger than life, a 
calculation beyond the average person's ability to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Einstein was the first to create a formula that made the machine 
possible, t=fc2 (Tortilla equals Flour times the speed of a Conveyor belt 
squared), and Stephen Hawking expanded on the theory in his trailblazing "A 
Brief History of Tortillas." 
</P>
<P>
 I am ignorant when it comes to understanding such matters. Before visiting La 
Tapatia's Godzilla, my only close experience with tortillas was at a Venice 
restaurant called Casablanca, where two elderly women known as the Tortilla 
Sisters slap out dozens of them in a short period of time. I don't know how 
many, exactly, because I never counted them. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Haro, the owner of Casablanca, shrugged when I asked and said, "Many, 
many." 
</P>
<P>
 Many, many does not compare to the 400 zipped out every minute by Godzilla, 
but then Godzilla doesn't smile and hum the way the Tortilla Sisters do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mega Press stands 18 feet high and is 120 feet long. When I first saw it 
towering ominously over its smaller cousins I was reminded of a Stephen King 
short story from his "Night Shift" collection. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, a giant pressing machine in a dry-cleaning establishment somehow tastes 
blood. On the night of a moon as round as a Tapatia tortilla it breaks free 
from its moorings and strides through town, killing and terrorizing. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not anticipate that Godzilla will do that. Mike Venema feels in his heart 
that it is a beneficial, peace-loving machine, much like Jane Fonda, and will 
do its job forever with wit and good taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapatia's president, Larry Flores, is proud of Godzilla. When his family began 
the business in 1971, they were producing 10,000 tortillas a day. Today, thanks 
to the Machine, they produce more than 1 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
 A million eight-inch tortillas, laid end to end, would reach from Malibu to 
Downtown L.A. and back again, as driven on by a 450SL at speeds exceeding the 
legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm sure you've heard all you want to hear about a tortilla machine that 
does everything but sing "La Cucaracha." I feel in my heart it's time to end 
this and disappear in a cloud of tortilla dust and . . . Wait. What's that I 
hear? OH, MY GOD, IT'S THE TORTILLA MACHINE RIPPING FROM ITS MOORING AND 
HEADING . . . NO, NO . . . DON'T. . . SCREEEAAAMMM !. . .

EGYPT AND LIBYA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My 21-year-old daughter, Theodora, was one of those murdered by Libyan agents 
in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am 103 on Dec. 21, 1988, so I read Kim Murphy's 
article on Egypt's defense of Moammar Kadafi (Dec. 1) with great interest and 
growing anger. The Mubarak government has clearly become Libya's chief defender 
and protector.The insensitivity and arrogance of Osama Baz, "the second most 
powerful man in Egypt," is almost breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Baz is quoted as saying that the U.S. does no understand the Middle East "and 
what motivates people of the region to behave in a certain manner." He then 
goes on to state, "Bear in mind it is not an easy thing for a government to 
extradite its own citizens to be tried in another country." 
</P>
<P>
 Baz should bear in mind that it is not an easy thing for a government to have 
its own citizens blown out of the sky by agents of another government and then 
sit by and do nothing, which is what he in essence is suggesting that the U.S. 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 One can hope that the new Congress will be less willing to shell out over $2 
billion a year to a government that is serving as a mouthpiece for murderers of 
Americans.

 If you really want to reform the legal system, either make the attorneys pay 
for frivolous lawsuits or limit their fees. Only then will you see a reduction 
in liability cases. Hello! Is anyone listening?

GOOD BUDGETING, NO SUBSTITUTES; A LESSON IN ORANGE COUNTY -- FANCY INVESTMENTS 
WON'T SUFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Treasurer Robert L. Citron's resignation Monday amid mounting 
pressure stemming from massive losses in the county's investment fund offers 
food for thought on investment practices for any public agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The county now needs prudent new investment leadership.Assistant County 
Treasurer Matt Raabe, named to replace Citron until January, might hold the 
fort a few weeks but a fresh start is desirable for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last spring, Citron rode the expressed confidence of Wall Street and the 
satisfaction of pool investors to easy reelection amid isolated, partisan 
opposition to his strategies, which had consistently reaped generous returns. 
On Monday there were suggestions that the crisis might be bigger than imagined 
last week when the county acknowledged it had lost $1.5 billion. Investigators 
from the Securities and Exchange Commission were asking whether the portfolio 
might have been subject to fraud. The City of Irvine announced that it is 
withdrawing $25 million from the fund. How could what had seemed so right turn 
out to be so wrong?  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, better oversight of investments involving public money is needed in 
the future. But those crossing their fingers and hoping financial wizardry will 
keep city services going need to change their expectations, too. Counties and 
localities have been under the gun as state and federal sources of revenue 
dried up. What seemed to be prudent investing fell far short when it was tied 
to higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Many public agencies had come to depend on the sweepstakes in their agonized 
struggle to meet rising costs as revenues dwindled. To keep finances in order, 
they must rely on more conventional and painful ways of balancing budgets, 
without using the financial markets to wish upon a star.

EMBRYO RESEARCH: MUDDY POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's veer to the right since the election is understandable. 
But his hasty action late Friday to forbid government-backed research on human 
embryos created in the laboratory is troubling -- not just because he has 
blocked potentially valuable research but because of what it reveals about 
policy-making chaos at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after his inauguration in 1993, Clinton reversed the ban on fetal-tissue 
research. Later he signed legislation to open research on embryos. A panel of 
19 leading doctors, lawyers and ethicists labored for nearly a year to write 
research rules, and an advisory committee of the director of the National 
Institutes of Health approved them Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, without informing even the NIH director, Clinton torpedoed most of the 
work. While banning creation of embryos solely for research, Clinton left open 
limited experimentation on "spare" embryos derived from couples in fertility 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing possible gains in treating infertility, birth defects, genetic defects 
and cancer, the NIH panel had urged research in which artificially fertilized 
human-egg cells would be studied for up to two weeks, before first signs of a 
nervous system, and then destroyed. Such cell masses, it said, did not have the 
"same moral status" as infants. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing it was venturing into choppy moral waters, stirring public fears of 
bizarre Frankenstein-like tinkering, the panel rejected more daring procedures, 
such as cloning of embryos and transfer of human embryos into animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Still the proposal met stiff opposition. In a letter written by Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove), 35 members of Congress complained of "bizarre 
experiments" that involved the "destruction of human beings." 
</P>
<P>
 One does not have to accept this definition of the start of human life to have 
qualms about this research. Even several members of the NIH panel, despite 
surface unanimity, had private doubts, given the unimpressive results of 
previous embryo research and the failure yet to persuade the public that this 
research was valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly all this influenced Clinton's action, as well as concerns that the 
new Republican majority could use the issue to cut other parts of the federal 
biomedical research budget. But Clinton's ham-handed reaction suggests he is 
more concerned about reelection than making sound science policy.

POLITICS WATCH; CHARGING TOO HARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 . . . I have here in my hand a list of 205 (persons) that were known to the 
secretary of state as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless 
are still working and shaping the policy of the State Department.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Sen. Joseph McCarthy, 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 9, 1950 
</P>
<P>
 I had a senior law enforcement official tell me that in his judgment up to a 
quarter of the White House staff, when they first came in, had used drugs in 
the last four or five years.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Rep. Newt Gingrich, 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 4, 1994 
</P>
<P>
 If the political education of Americans has taught anything in the last four 
decades it's that unattributed allegations of misconduct puffed up with 
impressive sounding numbers that no one else has ever seen are best treated 
with extreme caution, if not outright doubt and rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich, soon to be House Speaker, offered his wild-swinging charge in 
response to a question about why he considered President Clinton and his wife 
members of the "counterculture." He cited no source and he named no names in 
what appears to have been an effort to depict a White House overrun by dopers. 
And so everyone working there has been slandered. 
</P>
<P>
 Irresponsible is the mildest description for such shameful rumormongering. 
Gingrich dismisses his own acknowledged smoking of marijuana while a student as 
youthful behavior, yet insists without offering a shred of evidence that the 
Clinton White House continues to tolerate drug use. The incoming Speaker is 
building himself a big and very nasty credibility problem.

A TAGGER DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A young man came to the rear door the other night. There was blood on his 
hand, and he held his neck.The rescue ambulance arrived in minutes, followed by 
paramedics and police. Yellow police tape went up. I was told to wait, this had 
become a crime scene, perhaps a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was later to die of his wound. 
</P>
<P>
 They said he was a tagger. 
</P>
<P>
 I wondered what was told to his friends and family. What cause, what principle 
did they say this young man died to honor? 
</P>
<P>
 What was his contribution? Late teens, perhaps early 20s, such a short life. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt helpless. I had no illusion that some act on my part could have saved 
or prolonged his life. I felt helpless because I think of other young people 
who die for no good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not know how to tell someone that life has value, that death can be 
meaningful and that dying as a tagger is such a meager accomplishment.

SERB ADVANCE ON BIHAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do I understand correctly that the Serb armies are being allowed to overrun 
Bihac, the other U.N. "safe areas" and eventually all of Bosnia? Do I 
understand correctly that this murderous aggression will be allowed because the 
Europeans don't want to get "involved"? 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the same Europe that gave us the Kaiser's and Hitler's Germany? Is 
this the same Europe that gave us communism and the Cold War? Is this the 
Europe that gave us colonial wars of independence all over the globe, including 
our own? 
</P>
<P>
 When "Greater Serbia" eventually invades her neighbors, when Serbia aims 
nuclear warheads at Paris, London and Berlin, will these same reticent 
Europeans once again beat a path to our door? Will the United States, as a 
member in good standing of NATO and the U.N., be called upon to defeat the 
"monster"? It is time for the U.S. to either take action, unilaterally, against 
the Serbs, or to withdraw completely and permanently from the U.N. and NATO.

 * Send peacekeepers into troubled regions, then claim that no further actions 
can be taken to remedy the situation because the peacekeepers will get hurt. 
Logic which only hurts in places like Bosnia, Somalia and all future 
international efforts.

 * The custodians of the U.N. Security Council have timidly surrendered to the 
might of the militant Serbs, first by cutting arms to Muslims to defend their 
lives and then allowing Serbs to do everything to punish, torture and rape 
hopeless and hungry Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 The European and American leaders like House Foreign Affairs Committee 
Chairman Lee Hamilton must be congratulated for their great human rights 
achievement. We should give gold medals to the great Michael Rose, U.N. 
commander in Bosnia, Yasushi Akashi and Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
and all permanent members of the Security Council for ending the war in Bosnia 
by doing everything to allow butchering of more than 300,000 Muslims of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 What a new world order! Millions of Christians enjoy holidays while Muslims in 
Bosnia mourn for their loss of children, husbands, wives, mothers and fathers. 
It is time for 1.8 billion Muslims of this world to wake up and first stand up 
to their own corrupt and powerless leadership in their own nations, and 
thereafter unite together to raise their voice against their unknown enemies 
who not only control the U.N. Security Council but the economy and the 
civilization of this world.

 * Clearly the time has come to re-evaluate the NATO organization, its 
usefulness, and the need to reorganize in light of its powerlessness in the 
Bosnian war crisis. Its ineptness, indecision and dependency upon the U.S. to 
resolve every crisis can no longer be tolerated.

 * We, the West, have lost the first phase of World War III -- the struggle 
against all types of terrorist governments in the world. Today we lost Bosnia, 
tomorrow it will be Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, Albania and, with the 
resurgence of communist leaders in Eastern Europe, the entire East-European 
bloc will revert to its creed. Soon will follow the reconquest by Russia of the 
former territories of the Soviet Union.  
</P>
<P>
 We must stop the aggressors while we still have time and power. This stop must 
be made not in terms of "principles" (which we don't have or at least are not 
defending), but for very concrete reasons: One day it will be our turn. We must 
risk and take preemptive actions and history will be on our side.

 * After tuning in on the morning news regarding the Serbs' move to take over 
Bihac, I opened the morning issue of your paper to the front page of more of 
the same (Nov. 28). On to page A17 and Bob Dole's comment that we should "get 
the United Nations Protection Force out of there . . . and let the Bosnians 
defend themselves." What a cop-out! I am appalled at his suggestion! I cannot 
believe that we are going to, once again, let the Serbs massacre yet another 
group of innocent people. How many towns and cities of Yugoslavia are going to 
have to fall before we intervene? Of course, if Yugoslavia was oil-rich our 
troops would be there in a heartbeat! 
</P>
<P>
 The TV picture of the faces of those men, women and children of the town of 
Bihac waiting like lambs for the slaughter will forever remain imprinted in my 
mind and heart, as will the verbal plea from their spokesperson to a world of 
deaf people. 
</P>
<P>
 I am only thankful that my father, as a first-generation Yugoslavian who was 
the best American citizen I will ever know, is not alive to witness the 
disgraceful apathy and "buck passing" of our politicians in the cruel and 
inhuman destruction of his beautiful homeland.

SCHOOL PRAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With all this talk about the need for prayer in school, and the potential for 
the state developing a prayer mutually acceptable to all, one very important 
perspective seems to have been missed -- would God really want to listen to 
such a prayer? 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of a prayer do you think God would like to hear -- a 
state-developed, mutually acceptable, politically and religiously correct 
prayer, forcibly recited by children in a halfhearted manner, within publicly 
owned buildings, architecturally devoid of the sacred? Or, God may prefer to 
hear: 
</P>
<P>
 * The inspired prayer of the Muslim teen-age boy, bowed in homage toward 
Mecca, uttered within the spiritual beauty of his mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 * The reflective prayer of the young girl, said in the beauty of her temple 
garden, as she grows in the knowledge of the ancient traditions of her Buddhist 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
 * The glorious prayer, based on ancient Hebrew Scriptures, sung by the young 
Jewish boy in his temple on the Sabbath.  
</P>
<P>
 * The simple prayer of joy and praise said by the young Protestant girl at the 
Easter sunrise service of her church. 
</P>
<P>
 * The prayer of thanksgiving said by the young Catholic boy on receiving his 
first Holy Communion, bathed in the inspirational shafts of light radiating 
down through the stained glass windows in his church. 
</P>
<P>
 Please -- let us give God credit for some good taste! 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Perhaps the school prayer question can be solved by deeds (constitutionally 
correct) rather than words (constitutionally questionable). 
</P>
<P>
 Students could do any or all of the following without threatening the First 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring in a can of food or a box of cereal for the hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make an effort to become close the another student of a different creed, 
color or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
 * Help to keep this beautiful earth beautiful by depositing gum, candy 
wrappers, soda cans in containers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leave guns, knives, bats, etc. at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use the questionable prayer time to discuss ways of realizing the ideal of 
the brotherhood of man.

PERSPECTIVE ON PROSTITUTION; PROSECUTION OR PERSECUTION?; HEIDI FLEISS' TRIAL 
SHOWED THE HYPOCRISY IN MAKING A COMMON TRANSACTION A 'SERIOUS' SEX CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLORIA ALLRED and LISA BLOOM, Gloria Allred is an attorney in Los Angeles 
and a talk-show host on KABC radio. Lisa Bloom is an associate with the law 
firm of Allred, Maroko & Goldberg. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free Heidi Fleiss (and all other women incarcerated for prostitution-related 
offenses)! 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss is the latest prominent victim of a legal system that primarily 
punishes women for acts committed equally by women and men. We can remedy this 
inequity by legalizing prostitution, regulating and taxing sex workers and 
redirecting law enforcement to real sex crimes with real victims, like rape and 
sexual abuse of children. 
</P>
<P>
 We can no longer accept the rampant sexism in prostitution prosecutions. Women 
do not commit acts of prostitution alone any more than women get pregnant 
alone. Our law-enforcement system chooses to ignore the fact that most 
prostitution consists of private, consensual sexual activity between two 
persons, usually a woman and a man. But in every state where prostitution is a 
crime, it is overwhelmingly women, not men, who are rounded up like sheep, 
demeaned, jailed and fined -- and then released to continue turning tricks. 
Meanwhile, the men, who engaged in illegal acts just as much as the women, are 
free to patronize other prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 One answer may be equal enforcement of the law against customers rather than 
continued enforcement of a double standard replete with blatant gender bias. 
But there's an even better solution: Legalize and regulate the sex industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostitution isn't immoral; hurting women is. Prostitution is simple and 
direct: Man (almost always) pays woman (usually) for sex; man gets sexual 
pleasure for money, woman gets money for her labor. It is as simple a 
transaction as selling blood or the use of a uterus for nine months by 
surrogate mothers. What is wrong is the hypocrisy of the criminal-justice 
system's distinction between legal and illegal sex workers and the painful, 
disproportionate suffering heaped upon real women as a result. Why is it 
immoral to be paid for an act that is perfectly legal if done for free? 
</P>
<P>
 The lines that our society has drawn in the name of morality have become 
absurd. A woman may agree to sexual acts with men she doesn't love as long as 
she does not directly charge them for sex. She may legally pose nude for money, 
genitalia displayed, for photographers. She may dance nude, as provocatively as 
the customer likes, for money. She may engage in sexual acts for money with men 
she does not know or like in erotic films, magazines or before a live audience. 
She may sell her voice for "phone sex" with strange men. She may give a naked 
man an erotic massage. She may marry a man she does not love and have sex in 
return for his financial support for the rest of her married life. Yet the sale 
of direct sexual acts remains illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument that prostitution hurts women cannot justify criminalizing its 
victims. To the contrary. The problems with prostitution are a direct result of 
its illegality. Sexually transmitted diseases and drug abuse would be decreased 
if sex workers were licensed, screened, tested and treated rather than being 
driven underground. Unprotected, uninsured sex workers are the real victims who 
deserve legal status and an end to government-funded harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality of prostitution is that most women do it not as a true "choice," 
but only because they cannot support themselves and their children any other 
way. It is a sad truth that in our culture, the only occupations in which women 
as a group earn more than men as a group are prostitution and nude modeling.  
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, why is Heidi Fleiss going to jail? (Pandering carries a sentence 
of mandatory prison time in California.) It is because she is a businesswoman 
who brought together men who desired to pay women for sex and women who desired 
to get paid for sex. Do you think that's immoral? Then don't do it yourself, 
but don't ask for our tax dollars to support the vast system devoted to 
arresting, prosecuting, convicting, incarcerating and monitoring prostitutes.

 U.S. Sues Hospitals for Denying Discounts: The Justice Department filed the 
antitrust lawsuit against a group of New York hospitals for limiting and 
refusing to grant discounts to health maintenance organizations and 
managed-care plans. Simultaneously with filing the suit, the department 
announced a proposed settlement of the case.The suit, filed in Brooklyn federal 
court, alleges that the eight hospitals set up an organization called Classic 
Care Network Inc. in 1991 to act as their exclusive bargaining agents with 
HMOs. The hospitals account for a majority of beds in New York's Nassau and 
Suffolk counties. Classic Care would deny discounts on care given to patients 
admitted to the hospitals and would limit discounts on outpatient services. The 
proposed settlement, which requires court approval, prevents Classic Care 
hospitals from making any further effort to prevent hospital discounts or from 
using Classic Care as a joint sales agent.

 T-Bill Rates Rise to Highest Level in Nearly Four Years: The Treasury sold 
$13.6 billion of new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.83%, up 
from 5.44% last week. Another $13.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at 
an average discount rate of 6.33%, up from 5.86%.The three-month bill rate was 
the highest since they averaged 5.86% on March 25, 1991. The six-month bill 
rate was the highest since they averaged 6.51% on Jan. 7, 1991. The new 
discount rates understate the actual return to investors: 6% for three-month 
bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,852.60, and 6.63% for a six-month 
bill selling for $9,680. The discount rate reflects the price discount received 
when government securities are purchased at less than face value.

NATIONAL AGENDA; CUBA'S ARMY BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT THAN PARTY; THE MILITARY 
COMMANDS THE ECONOMY AS COMMUNISTS LOSE CREDIBILITY. BUT FIDEL CASTRO SEEMS 
SAFE FOR NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cuban army, always one of the most efficient and powerful instruments of 
Fidel Castro's regime, has overtaken and in many cases replaced the Communist 
Party as Cuba's most important institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army's new role can be seen everywhere," said a Latin American military 
expert, confirming reports from diplomatic and other sources here. "It's the 
driving force in reorganizing the economy, in increasing food production and 
distribution. It even runs the best tourist agency in Cuba. Where you used to 
have to be a member of the (Communist) party to get anywhere here, now you 
should be in uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 "The army is the essential pillar in Castro's support," a diplomat said. 
"Everywhere you look, it is the army that is getting things done. You no longer 
hear of the party as the instrument of either reform or leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Either as a result of the developments, or as its cause, the growing 
importance of the army, which is commanded by Fidel's brother Raul, is being 
matched by a serious weakening of the party, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Communist leadership is suffering from hardened arteries and ideas," 
according to a diplomat whose country has friendly relations with the Castro 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The party is seen as stupid at best and venal at worst," he said. "It is 
discredited and blamed for the country's (economic) woes by nearly all Cubans. 
It has no influence except a negative one." 
</P>
<P>
 As a show of military strength and as a sign of its rejection of party 
policies that spurred 32,000 Cubans to flee the country during the summer's 
"boat people" exodus, the army leadership replaced more than half of the 
Communist Party leaders in the countryside with its own people. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause, the development of the army into Cuba's most powerful 
instrument affects the immediate power equation but, according to most experts, 
leaves uncertain the future of Castro and his system. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that the top military leaders are as dogmatic as Castro and 
support him in power," a Latin American ambassador said, "although they are 
clearly fed up with the way things have gone and see some need for changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean," the diplomat added, "that they will accept any real 
reforms. They just want more efficiency and they want the power. Don't forget 
that the army commander is Raul, and he's as committed to the revolution as his 
brother." At 63, the military commander is four years younger. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, some diplomats said the 180,000-member army by its nature 
is more professional and more pragmatic than the party and that "down the 
ladder a step or two" from Raul Castro and the senior officers "are a level of 
lieutenant colonels and troop commanders that want change." 
</P>
<P>
 "These officers may not be capitalists," another European expert said, "but 
they are no longer committed Communists. They take pride in their profession 
and in the institution. They don't want to see it destroyed by revolution or 
total economic collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, even as the military moves toward primacy in Cuban society, the 
visible presence of uniformed soldiers on the street has diminished. The 
soldiers do not do police work or take part in the increasing repression of 
dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the strength of the military was shown by a promise it reportedly 
extracted from Castro and other hard-liners during the summer that its troops 
would not be used to put down the anti-government riots that broke out in July 
and August. 
</P>
<P>
 "That same group of lieutenant colonels (who want reforms) are determined not 
to use force" against the population, one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Castro realized that the army (largely made up of draftees) probably would 
refuse to shoot ordinary demonstrators, and any effort to make them do so could 
lead to a rebellion that at best would humiliate him and at worst would drive 
him from power," said a European military expert. 
</P>
<P>
 During the outbreak of antiregime rioting in Havana last summer, police and 
special security units were deployed, but not the army. A small number of 
demonstrators were killed or wounded by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prominent new role taken by the military is in food production and 
distribution, one of the weakest areas of government policy and increasingly 
the focus of popular discontent. According to agricultural experts, more than 
50% of all food production available now comes from military farms, viewed by 
foreign and Cuban sources as the only efficient supplier of goods in the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a dictum put down in July by Raul Castro that "beans are more 
important than cannons," army leaders organized the Oct. 1 opening of private 
farmers markets closed by Fidel Castro eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Even compared to what was available to the public just seven months ago in 
government-controlled stores or on the black market, there is considerably more 
produce and meat on sale now, although supplies do not come close to meeting 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still spending most of their time and money just trying to feed 
their families," said a Cuban movie maker. "It is still a day-to-day struggle, 
but . . . at least there is a little more, if you can raise the money. If that 
is due to the army, then bless the army." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this food is being grown on army bases by a special group of draftees 
called the Army Labor Youth. Instead of hauling troops or artillery, army 
trucks tote tomatoes corn to markets. And because troops are doing the 
supplying, much of the theft -- some analysts estimate 75% of all food was 
stolen before reaching market -- has been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The military presence is evident in nearly all aspects of the economy. 
Military engineers have taken over hotel construction for the expanding tourist 
sector, and officers have taken charge of retail stores, including outlets that 
sell goods to tourists with dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most efficient tourist agency in Cuba is Gaviota, an army-run 
group that operates tourist buses, expensive hotels, fishing marinas and an inn 
near the U.S. Marine base at Guantanamo Bay where visitors are served expensive 
Scotch and binoculars to watch the U.S. troops on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 A foreign expert whose government is strongly opposed to Castro remarked that 
"the army is trying to be Cuba's most modern institution. . . . They're trying 
to become efficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Added a friendlier diplomat: "They are using free-market policies, including 
bonuses and productivity incentives to get things done. It still falls far 
short of free enterprise, and it doesn't yet signal a switch to capitalism, but 
compared to what was going on, it is a hopeful change." The Cuban Army's Sweep 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba's army runs some decidedly non-military enterprises. They include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Union de Empresas Constructoras -- A construction company that builds hotels 
and beach resorts as well as industrial facilities and such utilities as 
pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRD Caribe -- Department stores devoted exclusively to foreigners. Its name 
stands for Tienda Recaudacion en Divisas, or "stores to collect foreign 
currency." 
</P>
<P>
 * Gaviota -- The army's tourist company operates bus tours, airlines, hotels, 
spas, marinas, hunting preserves and related tourism activities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Agriculture -- More than 50% of agricultural production is controlled by the 
army, largely through the Youth Labor Army. More on Cuba

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; AT PEACE, BUT STILL NOT FRIENDS; ARABS ARE RELUCTANT TO FULLY 
NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL EVEN AFTER THREE HISTORIC TREATIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At the gala opening of the annual Cairo International Film Festival last week, 
jewel-bedecked stars and new films from throughout the Middle East were on 
display. Top filmmakers from Syria, Algeria, Morocco and Egypt rubbed elbows. 
</P>
<P>
 What wasn't there, in this era of Middle East glasnost, was anyone from 
Israel. Despite the Jerusalem government's repeated requests over the years to 
take part in the event, there were no Israeli films and no Israeli stars. The 
Israeli Embassy's cultural attache to Egypt -- until this year the only Arab 
country with which Israel was at peace -- stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival might have set a different tone, since the past two years have 
seen Israel signing peace agreements with Jordan and the Palestinians that 
mirror its landmark, 15-year-old peace treaty with Egypt. But that didn't 
happen. The audience sat back opening night to a three-hour premiere of "The 
Road to Eilat," a heady celebration of a successful Egyptian amphibious 
operation against the Israeli navy in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to peace and cooperation? It was being celebrated across town at 
the Giza Zoo, where officials, with much fanfare, signed a new cooperative 
agreement with the Tel Aviv Zoo. But that pact drew a disdainful response from 
Saad Eddin Wahba, the film festival director. "Only donkeys, monkeys and foxes 
are interested in normalizing relations with Israel," he sneered. 
</P>
<P>
 Normalization has come hard, even with Egypt. The momentous peace agreement 
signed at the White House last year by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat raised hopes that have yet to be met, or even 
approached. The hands that clasped in Washington, that led to the Nobel Peace 
Prize for Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Arafat and Rabin, remain 
firmly pocketed most of the time back home in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 The film festival snub wasn't unusual: No Israeli film has ever been shown in 
Egypt. A number of Egyptian tour companies began offering travel packages to 
Israel for the first time earlier this year, but then all but one canceled them 
by September. The artists, directors, actors, musicians, lawyers, engineers, 
doctors and journalists syndicates all forbid their members to travel to the 
Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen years into peace between Egypt and Israel, there are only two major 
joint economic projects under way -- both launched only this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The peace treaties signed with both Jordan and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization have plunged the Arab world into one of the most difficult 
dilemmas of peace: How much, and on whose terms? When governments sign 
treaties, are citizens obligated to follow with open arms? Exactly when will 
Israel finally become a functioning partner -- economically, socially and 
culturally -- in its own neighborhood? 
</P>
<P>
 "The battle of political and cultural normalization with the Jews is the 
fiercest battle facing us," Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt said at a 
recent conference in Beirut called specifically to find ways to combat moves 
toward normalizing relations. 
</P>
<P>
 For a wide spectrum of Arabs, peace as a means of ending more than four 
decades of warfare is an idea whose time has come. But going a further step and 
embracing Israel as a partner and neighbor is an idea with little appeal for 
most Arabs. "Normalization" has become a hot new debate from Morocco to the 
Persian Gulf, and in most quarters it is being greeted with suspicion, if not 
outright hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normalization is defined as a normal relationship with the state of Israel on 
cultural, political and social levels. We do not believe that normalization is 
possible for the simple reason that Israel is a colonial settler state which 
occupies Arab lands and practices all forms of violence and human rights 
violations," said Radwa Ashour, a Cairo novelist and professor who is active in 
the Committee to Protect the National Culture. One of its primary goals is 
guarding against cultural cooperation with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jordan, the National Islamic Front issued a religious decree against 
normalization, declaring that "God has strictly forbidden subservience to those 
who usurp the land of Muslims or expel them from their homes," and warning 
"honorable merchants" not to "buy the goods of the Jews or deal with them or 
engage in any form of industrial, tourist or agricultural cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 In Lebanon, Islamic intellectuals and secular nationalists from around the 
Arab world met in October and agreed on a program to schedule meetings, rallies 
and seminars as a means of "rejection of normalization with the Zionist enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Agreements between governments do not concern us. Nationalism is not so much 
a government concern as it is the concern of the people," declared Mohammed 
Baalbeki, president of the Lebanese Press Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah, the Islamic militia fighting Israeli occupation in the south of 
Lebanon, said it would conduct regular mosque sermons urging Muslims to boycott 
Israeli products, deter the exchange of tourist, cultural and educational 
delegations, and obstruct trade with the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, one of the low points came only a few weeks 
ago, when heavy factional fighting between Palestinian Islamic militants and 
the Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip was greeted with editorials in all 
three government dailies in Egypt -- blaming the Israelis, who hadn't even been 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli diplomats complained they had never had an opportunity to meet with 
Egypt's top newspaper editors -- their overtures were repeatedly rebuffed -- 
and asked whether this was the way to repay Israel's peace initiatives with the 
Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Arabs see the normalization card, particularly on the cultural level, as the 
ordinary citizen's last means of expressing opposition to Israel's continued 
occupation of the West Bank, Golan Heights and the self-declared security zone 
in south Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel perceives of culture as a point of entry to the Egyptian mind. Yet 
Egyptians -- and here I mean the people rather than the government, which 
abides by the spirit and text of the treaty -- have been reluctant to engage in 
cultural relations," said Salaheddin Hafez, managing editor of Cairo's 
semiofficial Al Ahram newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cultural normalization should be conditional on Israel meeting the legitimate 
demands of the government, demands that include Israeli withdrawal from all 
occupied Arab lands and compliance with international conventions eliminating 
weapons of mass destruction," Hafez added. "The meeting of such conditions 
would display Israeli commitment to a comprehensive peace in the region. And 
without such a commitment, any talk about a culture of peace remains pie in the 
sky." 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk Hosni, at a meeting of writers and 
intellectuals in the southern Egyptian city of Luxor last month, urged Arabs to 
begin embarking on cultural normalization as a natural follow-up to strides 
already being made on the agricultural, trade and economic front, most notably 
with the recent Middle East economic summit in Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the signing of the Israeli-PLO accord, Egypt has opened its border with 
Israel at Rafah 24 hours a day and dispatched four government ministers on 
visits since June. A delegation of 50 Egyptian business leaders visited Tel 
Aviv to discuss trade issues Nov. 5, about the same time that the Israeli 
shekel, for the first time in history, began being traded in Egyptian banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 12,000 Egyptian tourists visited Israel this past year -- up from 
almost none in past years, though still much lower than the 150,000 Israelis 
who came to Egypt -- and trade volume between Egypt and Israel is expected to 
reach $35 million this year, a nearly fourfold increase over 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many Arabs are skittish even on the economic front. Though the Arab 
boycott against Israel is falling to shreds in the wealthy Arab countries of 
the Gulf, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, it remains in full force in Syria 
and Lebanon. Lebanon, the Arab world's historic commercial center before its 
disastrous civil war, is at the forefront of those Arab states who fear that 
Israel will quickly dominate any new Middle East market at the expense of the 
Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The normalization of relations with Israel is against the interests of 
Lebanon, particularly on the economic side. We already compete with Israel, 
especially in tourism and banking. We used to be the banking center of the Arab 
world, and we would like to be again," said Issam Naaman, a member of 
Parliament in Lebanon. "In the case of normalization of relations, we would be 
losing on both fronts." 
</P>
<P>
 Syrians, Lebanese and Jordanians have been critical of the few cultural 
strides made between Israel and the Arab world. At the Lebanese 
anti-normalization conference, Arabs complained that Israel is successfully 
seeking to change the way history is taught to Arab students and to redraw maps 
of Palestine to show the presence of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 An Israeli official, who asked not to be identified, said that indeed Israel 
had insisted, as part of the Camp David accords, that references to Israel as 
"the enemy" in school textbooks be deleted. "After you make a peace treaty with 
a country, it is only natural that you won't call it the enemy again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Israel wishes the Arabs would undergo the same kind of "education for 
peace" that Israel is embarking on -- requiring all students to learn Arabic, 
teaching them about the benefits of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the midst of a hell of a peace process. We explain to children what 
is the peace process, what are the circumstances, what are the consequences, 
what can it bring. I would be very glad if this kind of stuff would be taught 
in Egyptian and Arab schools," the official remarked. "I don't say all Arabs 
should learn Hebrew. But it shows an attitude to education." 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of the storm, a growing number of Arab intellectuals are bucking 
the prevailing winds, tentatively cracking a door that many believe will open 
full-scale once the economic benefits of peace begin to take hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the journalists and musicians syndicates in Cairo have indicated they are 
going to review their longstanding ban on travel to Israel early next year, 
reflecting the fact that some artists and writers are already, in fact, 
traveling to the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian singer Medhat Saleh traveled to Israel to perform three concerts in 
March, which he said were intended "to share with the Palestinians their joy 
for regaining a precious part of their land." 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Ali Salem followed a month later, embarking on a 23-day odyssey 
around Israel after which he wrote a book on his impressions of the Jewish 
state, "A Trip to Israel." The book has been scornfully received in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say, 'We are with peace, but where is it? We have to wait till 
its implementation,' " Salem said. "I say, OK, you wait. I'm not going to wait. 
I'm going to share in making it. That's all. Because peace will not make 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 In counterpoint to the vitriol hurled at him in the Egyptian press, Salem got 
dozens of letters of support from readers. 
</P>
<P>
 One came from a man in Zawya al Hamra, one of Cairo's worst slums. The man 
identified himself as "a very simple Egyptian citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 "I read what you said about your trip to Israel, and I admired it. It proves 
to every citizen that you are a patriot," the man wrote. "I thought of this and 
I said to myself, 'Why haven't our thinkers gone to invade Israel to find out 
what they are thinking about our future as Arabs and Israelis?' Instead of 
burying our heads in the sand, why don't we converse with them? Why don't we 
find out what they want from us, and what we need from them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the man wrote, "why is there a peace? Was it to stop wars only?"

THE WEEK AHEAD: MEXICO CITY; A TEST IN CHIAPAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first test of Ernesto Zedillo's presidency will come Thursday, exactly a 
week after his inauguration, when ruling party governor-elect Eduardo Robledo 
is set to take office in the deeply divided southern state of Chiapas.  
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatista National Liberation Army, confined to its jungle stronghold 
since an uneasy truce with the government began in mid-January, has threatened 
a return to arms if Robledo takes over. Civil groups are planning protests 
against the governor-elect, saying that his Aug. 21 election was marked by 
fraud in restive Chiapas.

THE WEEK AHEAD: MIAMI; THE AMERICAS SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leaders of the United States and 33 other countries of the Western 
Hemisphere will begin a three-day Summit of the Americas in Miami on Friday 
aimed at establishing a free-trade zone. 
</P>
<P>
 With the issues of commerce and business heading the agenda of almost every 
Latin American and Caribbean country, the presidents and prime ministers at the 
U.S.-convened summit hope to reach agreement on specific steps to expand trade 
and foreign investment. However, no timetable will be set for economic 
integration, something some officials see as a drawback. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first meeting in nearly 30 years of so many of the hemisphere's 
presidents and prime ministers. The White House invited every national leader 
except Cuba's Fidel Castro.

MARKET FOCUS; CHINESE WORKERS FACE FRUSTRATIONS IN SOUTH KOREA; MOST ARE ETHNIC 
KOREANS, BUT THEY OFTEN DON'T FEEL AT HOME. LOW PAY, LONG HOURS AND CULTURE 
SHOCK ARE COMMON COMPLAINTS. 
</P>

 Choi Hyon Chul was born in northeast China, but he's an ethnic Korean and used 
to root for the Korean team whenever China and South Korea faced off in 
international sports competitions. He felt he was Korean. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before Choi left his factory job in China's Jilin province, which 
abuts the Korean peninsula, and came to South Korea to work illegally on 
construction sites. Here in Korea, despite his fluency in the language, Choi 
found his identity in crisis again. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in the land of his Korean ancestors did not make him want to stay on 
and try to assimilate. To the contrary, he was soon backing the Chinese side 
when athletic teams from the two countries met. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was our ancestral home, but we were born and grew up in China," he said 
of himself and other ethnic Koreans from China. "Although we speak the 
language, our habits aren't the same. There's no problem with daily life, (but) 
hunting for work, doing business -- these are the things we don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though wages here vastly exceed what they could earn at home, life for 
most is a constant struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi is one of more than 31,000 Chinese citizens -- 80% of them ethnic Koreans 
-- now in South Korea. Nearly all have come to work, some legally, with work 
permits under euphemistically named "training" programs, but the majority 
illegally, coming in on visitor visas and overstaying the time limit. 
</P>
<P>
 The flow of Korean Chinese to South Korea reflects a slowly spreading 
diplomatic thaw in northeastern Asia that could eventually lead to Korean 
reunification. But frustrations in the exchange of workers like Choi provide a 
warning: Any sudden integration of North Korean workers into South Korea's far 
more prosperous system would be fraught with difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Like North Koreans, the Korean Chinese laborers grew up under communism and 
can speak Korean. A key difference is that they also have experienced China's 
past 15 years of market-oriented reforms. Yet even with that experience, few 
fit in here. Most yearn to save up money and go home. 
</P>
<P>
 About 78,000 foreign laborers, including the Korean Chinese, are now working 
in South Korea. Nearly all have tough or unpleasant jobs that most South 
Koreans disdain. This increasingly prosperous country has even adopted into the 
Korean language the label "3-D" jobs -- shorthand for the English words "dirty, 
difficult or dangerous" -- to describe the work the foreigners do. Whether they 
have come as contract laborers or are working illegally, their pay is usually 
less than that of their South Korean counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi earns more than $1,250 a month in Seoul, a princely sum compared to the 
$50 a month he earned in China, but several hundred dollars less than his 
Korean co-workers here. The money, however, does not completely make up for 
painful attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The treatment here isn't equal, so most (Korean Chinese) are unhappy," Choi 
said. "The bosses think China is underdeveloped, and they treat people from 
China as lower-class. It creates bad feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoo Jung Ho, a scholar working with the South Korean government's Economic 
Planning Board, said that labor-intensive industries that are facing 
competition from low-wage nations are urging the government to let in even more 
foreign workers. But this can be only a short-term solution, and it risks 
creating social problems at home and diplomatic troubles abroad, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps some businesses temporarily, but it creates all sorts of other 
problems," Yoo said. Some Koreans treat the foreigners badly, he explained: 
"They may try to give them as little money as possible and try to extract as 
much time as possible from them. That's already happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these people are from China, Korean descendants, and they not only 
get disappointed in the South Korean government, sometimes they hate South 
Korea for treating them like that. They go back to China and they talk with 
North Koreans. I don't think that's good for reunification. For South and North 
Korea eventually to be able to successfully reunite, there should be no hatred 
or no misgivings about each other, but we are exactly creating that by 
maltreating Korean workers from China." 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean Minister of Labor Affairs Nam Jae Hee acknowledged in an 
interview that resentment is sometimes created because foreign trainees "are 
paid far less" than regular workers. "Some policy changes may be in order to 
pay them equally as the normal workers, after the training period is over," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the minister doubted that the situation could affect perceptions of the 
two Koreas. Ethnic Koreans in China still "are very much envious of the 
economic development in South Korea," he said, and Seoul does not consider it a 
serious security problem to have so many ethnic Koreans here from China, 
despite that country's Communist government and close ties to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because North Korea is such a failure, nobody fears the ideological 
connection," Nam said. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes trouble arises from a complex clash of expectations rooted in 
differences between the two societies. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers often think foreign workers should accept their position at the 
bottom rung of the employment ladder and be thankful for the opportunity to 
save up far more money than they could at home. Long hours of overtime are not 
unusual in South Korea and may be welcomed by some workers seeking to boost 
their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 But factory workers in China generally work an eight-hour day, and while pay 
may be low, demands usually are not too high. Many are shocked to discover how 
hard they are expected to work in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairly typical is the experience of a 54-year-old Korean Chinese woman from a 
village in Heilongjiang province. She quit her first job, at a restaurant in 
Seoul, after just one month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too tiring," explained the woman, who wished to be identified only by 
her surname, Jin. "You're standing for 12 hours a day. Your legs hurt. It's 
very hard to find an eight-hour job if you're not a South Korean citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 Jin later found work as a live-in maid, earning almost $900 a month. But she 
recently quit that job too. "There was too much work: 'Do this! Do that!' I 
wasn't willing to listen to them anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jin said she is looking for other work, and meanwhile her husband is earning 
$1,900 a month as a construction worker. They expect to return to China after 
two years in South Korea with enough money to buy homes for their two sons, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In China, you can't earn this much money in 10 years," she said. "I'm happy I 
came. It's just that the work is so hard I can barely endure it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A 48-year-old Korean Chinese man from Harbin, who asked to be identified only 
by his surname, Li, said that, before coming here nearly three years ago, he 
thought of Korea as his "motherland." But now he looks forward to going home to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our blood is the same, but the background is different," he said. "China is 
Communist and South Korea is capitalist. Our thinking is different. There are 
lots of difficulties in living here. Materially it's fine. But in terms of 
people's attitudes, it's very difficult. They have a class system. Rich people 
can mistreat poor people. 
</P>
<P>
 "In China, although I am of Korean ancestry, I was never discriminated against 
this way. Then I came here, and although I'm of the same blood, I've been 
mistreated very badly." 
</P>
<P>
 Li, who has bounced from one job to the next, complained bitterly about 
newspaper advertisements that he said describe jobs that sound reasonable but 
actually entail much more severe demands. 
</P>
<P>
 But some, like Jin Zhenghua, 25, a Korean Chinese peasant woman who solders 
sensor parts, accept their situation philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we wish we had higher wages, but that's impossible," said Jin, 25, 
who now earns about $300 a month at the Dong Kwang Sensor Industrial Co. in 
Seoul. "The reason they want us here is so they can save money."

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Bosnian conflict, a war that defies diplomatic solutions and continues 
a bloody path that has taken an estimated 200,000 lives, the world's editorial 
cartoonists have found little but despair.In recent days the target of their 
pens has been the U.N. peacekeeping force, which, with its civilian leaders, 
has been needled for its apparent ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic complained to the Western powers 
and Russia that "nothing is being undertaken" to suppress the Serbian assault 
on the Muslim safe zone of Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole international community, embodied in the United Nations and the 
mighty NATO pact, cannot save one endangered city," he complained.

MARKET FOCUS; ORGANIC BUSINESS BREWS IN SALVADOR; SMALL COFFEE FARMERS BATTLE 
SKEPTICISM AND CORPORATE PRESSURE IN HOPES OF EARNING HIGHER INCOMES 
'NATURALLY.'

 Pausing in the shade cast by thick forests of green coffee trees, Fidelina 
Mejia ponders the new project and says she is not completely sure that it makes 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the plan: The farming cooperative that Mejia has labored for since 1980 
will forgo the time-honored use of pesticides and chemicals and turn instead to 
the production of organic coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how it will work," the 41-year-old mother of five says during a 
break from picking red-brown coffee berries. "We'll just have to see if the 
coffee grows." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining a regional trend, the farmers of El Salvador are slowly moving into 
organic agriculture, a field that promoters say will help Central America's 
devastated ecology and ultimately earn better incomes for small farmers. 
Organic cashews, soy, vegetables and bananas are being cultivated throughout 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of organic farming in El Salvador have their job cut out for 
them: They are fighting both skepticism among peasant farmers who believe 
chemicals are necessary and resistance from big agrochemical companies 
controlled by some of this country's most powerful families. 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 years of civil war, parts of El Salvador are ideal for organic 
farming, experts say. Because of the fighting, huge lots of land were fallow 
for a long time, unworked and, most important, untouched by pesticides and 
herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
 With the market for organic products growing worldwide, and prices up to 30% 
higher than for non-organic crops, prospects seem especially appealing in this 
densely populated country where land is scarce. Organic farming is 
labor-intensive work. 
</P>
<P>
 Where pesticides, herbacides and other chemicals have been used in El 
Salvador, the application has often been excessive, with little care for the 
environment, U.S. experts say. The result is a toxic nightmare for both the 
land and the people working it. Many peasants cannot read the warning labels or 
directions on dangerous chemicals, such as paraquat, a herbicide that can 
damage lung tissue when inhaled . 
</P>
<P>
 "From an environmental point of view and from a health point of view, there is 
a real necessity for developing (organic farming) in El Salvador," said Michael 
J. Davis, president of EarthTrade Inc., a New York-based import-export firm 
that is promoting several organic projects in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've had a huge amount of chemicals pumped into an ecosystem that in the 
best of conditions would have trouble dealing with it and in El Salvador has 
proven disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
 Here in San Jose El Salto, the 1,200-acre San Simon farming cooperative voted 
to switch to organic methods and hopes to be certified early next year by 
international agencies that inspect the land, farming techniques and handling 
of the produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilio Ortiz, vice president of the co-op, said the farmers have their doubts 
that using material such as leaves, grass, ashes and vegetable refuse as mulch 
will protect the plants and condition the soil. But they're willing to try, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People understand that if you use too much chemicals, it will stop the land 
from producing," the 38-year-old Ortiz said. The co-op has also begun raising 
wasps to attack coffee weevils, tapping the biological aspects of organic 
farming. 
</P>
<P>
 San Simon is located in rolling hills in southwestern El Salvador, on what was 
once a large hacienda. Part of the hacienda was given to the peasants in a 1980 
agrarian reform, but the war took its toll among the workers, cutting 
drastically into harvests. The co-op once had 250 members; today it has 70. 
Many fled the fighting or were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who did not have a place to take refuge had to stay, and we had to have 
courage," Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little by little, we picked the coffee each year," said Argelio Calderon, 50, 
the co-op's machete-wielding watchman. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the new organic farmers are former guerrillas and, as part of 
U.N.-brokered peace accords that ended the bloody conflict in 1992, were given 
a plot of land. 
</P>
<P>
 At the oddly named Saigon cooperative, on the skirts of the Guazapa Volcano 
north of San Salvador, about 280 former rebels and their families have embraced 
organics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are convinced that to have a production that has value in the 
international market, it has to be quality and not quantity," said Carlos 
Ernesto Sorto, an eight-year guerrilla veteran. "We are convinced that in our 
country, it's organic coffee farming that has the most value. 
</P>
<P>
 "The soil is very eroded, unable to support big plantings. It (organic 
farming) helps the environment and it helps restore soil that has been the 
victim of pesticides and poisons." 
</P>
<P>
 The farmers at Saigon -- named for an infamous police lieutenant said to have 
ordered numerous killings in the area -- took over their 150-acre parcel two 
years ago. They say they have already noticed an improvement in the crop. "It 
is greener and there is more coffee," Sorto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organic coffee is still a tiny portion of El Salvador's overall production. 
Only six farms -- about 3,500 acres -- have been certified. But it is growing. 
El Salvador exported 100 tons of "green" beans last year and expects to 
increase that by half this year. Salvadoran organic coffee is sold under the 
label Cafe Pipil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers are getting there a lot faster than people want to believe," said 
Stanley Kuehn, the director in El Salvador of the Cooperative League of the 
United States of America, which was contracted by the U.S. Agency for 
International Development to provide training and technical assistance. Kuehn 
and other experts working in organic projects say it has been an uphill battle 
to wean farmers away from chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 But an obstacle even greater than the skepticism has been the powerful 
business interests that control the agrochemical industry. Kuehn reported 
several cases of co-ops that were trying to go organic being pressured into 
using chemicals, and he said banks have been known to condition loans based on 
the use of pesticides: no chemicals, no loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the families that dominate the industry are those of former President 
Alfredo Cristiani and Ricardo Montenegro, who was finance minister until last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few regulations governing the use of pesticides in El Salvador. 
Consequently, many farms suffer "chemical drift," where sprayed pesticides 
contaminate crops beyond the ones they were intended to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehn said a cotton crop that in the United States would get three to five 
applications of insecticide will usually receive more than 30 in El Salvador. 
Untrained and illiterate peasants will casually wash out fumigation equipment 
in streams or handle poisons with unprotected hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is catastrophic for the environment," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 During the war, American groups opposed to U.S. policy in Central America 
orchestrated a major boycott of Salvadoran coffee. But now it's almost chic. 
The biggest markets are the United States and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego-based Elan International Organic Coffees imports organically 
grown Salvadoran beans and ships them, with beans from other Latin American 
countries, to 260 roasters across the United States. That the coffee comes from 
El Salvador can be a selling point.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a novelty," Susan McDevitt, an Elan sales representative, said. 
"We talk to (customers) about the fact that it comes from El Salvador, where 
there was 12 years of civil war, and that they can support the farmers." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the Humboldt Bay Coffee Co. of Eureka, Calif., praised the 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up here on the northern coast, organic coffees are very popular," said 
Humboldt Bay's Jane Hall. "(The Salvadoran organic) is a very good coffee. It 
has an extremely good flavor, very pleasing to the palate." 
</P>
<P>
 Her colleague John Hall said his only problem is that he can't get enough of 
the stuff. Production levels are still low and are seasonal. The harvest has 
just started, meaning coffee won't be on shelves for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said Humboldt Bay often blends the Salvadoran product, using it as a 
component in organic espresso, or sells it straight. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a certain appeal when we first came out with Salvadoran organic -- 
this was coffee coming from plantations that had been part of the peace 
settlement -- we generated interest with that at first," he said. "Now it 
stands on its own as a quality coffee." Top Coffee Producers

BRIEFING PAPER; U.S.-INDIA TRADE POISED FOR TAKEOFF, MANY SAY; GREAT POTENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans and Indians in business and government see a huge surge in two-way 
business and trade just over the horizon. Last month, Sen. John F. Kerry 
(D-Mass.) led the heads of a dozen companies based in his state to New Delhi 
and Bangalore to drum up business, and he was enthusiastic about what he found. 
"If India continues down the road on the economic reforms, there will be almost 
more interest in doing business here than in China, because of the democracy, 
the legal system and no language barrier," the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
 "India has all the potential -- the biggest market, skilled labor, all 
resources, all facilities, liberalization, even simplification of various rules 
and regulations," N.S. Jain, deputy secretary of the Indian Federation of 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry, told a University of Pennsylvania seminar on 
Indo-U.S. business. 
</P>
<P>
 When U.S. Ambassador Frank G. Wisner called on leaders of Communist-run West 
Bengal in Calcutta, the longtime enemies of U.S. "imperialism" were keen on 
finding out how they could open the spigot to greater American investment in 
their state. Burgeoning Interest: 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's freer market policies and openness to 
foreign capital and business participation have so piqued the curiosity of 
American companies that East Coast seminars on the subject this fall were 
oversubscribed -- "you couldn't get in the door," recalls Undersecretary of 
Commerce Jeffrey E. Garten. He calls India "the last of the big emerging 
markets to open its doors to international commerce in a significant way."  
</P>
<P>
 Garten, commerce's point man on international trade, predicts a sharp rise in 
direct foreign investment in India over the next five years, at least $5 
billion to $10 billion annually. Conditions are ripe for a "gigantic leap" in 
the already much-improved Indo-U.S. business climate, Garten says, but he warns 
that America, now India's No. 1 investor, must be aggressive or risk losing on 
a "competitive battleground." 
</P>
<P>
 To sing the praises of U.S. business and industry and help break the ice for 
contacts and contracts, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown is scheduled to fly 
to India in January with 25 CEOs in tow. Expected later in 1995: Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Energy 
Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary. Where the Markets Are: 
</P>
<P>
 Two-way trade is expected by the Commerce Department to hit $7.8 billion in 
1994, with plenty of room for more expansion. Although the two countries 
possess one-fifth of the world's population and a quarter of its economic 
output between them, just 0.6% of made-in-U.S.A. exports went to India in 1993 
and the country has absorbed less than 0.3% of American foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 S.K. Bhargava, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, is so 
bullish about the future that his organization is drafting an action agenda 
that sets a target of $20 billion by the turn of the century.  
</P>
<P>
 Already, according to S.S. Ray, India's ambassador to Washington, U.S. 
companies accounted for a third of the $6.6 billion in direct foreign 
investment approved by Indian authorities in the three years ending last July, 
while 35% of the more than $13 billion invested from abroad in Indian mutual 
funds and other equities came from Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials see power generation, telecommunications, transportation, 
financial services -- including insurance -- and food processing as priority 
areas where India can profit from American capital, technology and know-how. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Reed, president and CEO of Nynex-New England, finds "enormous opportunity" 
for his Boston-based Baby Bell. India now has just 0.8 telephones per 100 
people, he says. Nynex-New England, which is working in Bangkok, Thailand, to 
install 2 million phones, is looking at five or six Indian companies as 
potential partners in a similar, $300-million to $500-million scheme to string 
cables and provide basic telephone service in one of India's metropolitan 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nynex has looked at India on a couple of occasions and walked away," says 
Reed, remembering the old "license raj" days when government officials had a 
chokehold on trade and industry. "But we're back, because the rules are 
changing." Problems Linger: 
</P>
<P>
 But many Americans say India, defined as "socialist" by its 1950 constitution, 
is not bringing itself into the international mainstream fast enough. That 
cautious pace frustrates visiting business people and may, they say, compel 
them to take their investment bankrolls and attache cases crammed with 
proposals elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Some frequent gripes: Westerners complain that the process of awarding 
contracts is secretive, leaving room for extortion and favoritism. Labor 
regulations dating from India's faded love affair with state micro-management 
of the economy remain on the books, making it often illegal to fire delinquent 
workers or trim payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 And, notes Kerry, "the level of bureaucracy is intimidating to some and 
daunting to others," with the government still a powerful economic player. For 
instance, Department of Telecommunications guidelines have been modified to 
allow foreign firms to hold a 49% equity in private ventures providing basic 
phone service, but the lucrative long-distance market is still a state 
monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a stumbling block right now, to be honest," says Reed of Nynex-New 
England. "We're going to invest our money where, frankly, we're going to get 
the best return." Illiteracy and Infrastructure: 
</P>
<P>
 The Achilles' heel of India's economic growth consists of its creaky, 
inadequate ports and its telecommunications system and transportation network, 
Garten says. Over the next six years, he predicts, India will need more than 
$100 billion in foreign capital to rebuild them or risk seeing plenty of 
business go to better-equipped countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The infrastructure has to be up to world-class standards, or the capital is 
not going to come," the U.S. official says. 
</P>
<P>
 India's signature of the final draft act of the GATT Uruguay Round in April 
committed it to enacting stronger patent legislation by 2005. American 
pharmaceutical, chemical and agricultural companies complain that Indian 
competitors for years have been illegally copying their drugs, compound 
fertilizers, herbicides and other products. 
</P>
<P>
 India has 10 years to bring its intellectual property laws in line with GATT, 
but U.S. officials would like to see them move faster. The lack of protections 
makes some U.S. firms hesitant about breaking into the Indian market. 
</P>
<P>
 Another handicap to increased U.S.-Indian commerce may lie in the nature of 
the labor force. Although India boasts the world's largest pool of scientific 
and engineering talent after the United States and Russia, 52% of its adults 
cannot read. Another potential Asian business partner, Vietnam, "is way ahead 
on basic skills," Kerry finds. Mostly Bullish: 
</P>
<P>
 By 2020, the World Bank forecasts, India will be the world's fourth-largest 
economy. The size of India's "middle class" is debated (as is the meaning of 
the term), but most agree it is enormous. Garten pegs the pool of potential 
consumers of foreign-made goods and services at more than 150 million already, 
each boasting annual purchasing power of more than $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Claude Smadja, the World Economic Forum's senior adviser for Asia, predicts 
economic growth in India of 5% to 5.5% this year (against 4% in 1993) and 
foreign capital in-flows of $6 billion to $8 billion. Export growth is 
projected at 15% this year but is still hurt by shoddy quality in some areas 
and tardy deliveries. Business Partners 
</P>
<P>
 America imports far more from India than it exports. But India's middle class 
represents a huge potential market.

MARKET SCENE; GERMANY SLIPS ON BANANAS; IT LOST A FIGHT WITH EUROPEAN UNION 
OVER QUOTAS BUT HASN'T GIVEN UP HOPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A banana is not a banana is not a banana. 
</P>
<P>
 To Germans, there are big, beautiful, tasty Latin American bananas, and there 
are all other bananas -- inferior fruit from anywhere but Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the world's biggest banana enthusiasts, Germans put up a hard fight over 
the past year to prevent the European Union from setting quotas and tariffs on 
Latin American bananas in favor of those from the few banana-producing 
countries of southern Europe and from former tropical colonies of the French 
and British empires. 
</P>
<P>
 But they lost. The prices of the tariff-laden Latin bananas have skyrocketed 
and sales have plummeted. Now German importers and consumers are looking to the 
United States to reopen doors to Latin America's luscious fruit. It was, after 
all, popularized in Germany by American GIs after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are paying for the old colonial burdens of Paris and London," Ulrich 
Boysen, a spokesman for the Federal Council of German Fruit Traders, said of 
the high-priced bananas now coming into Europe. "We lost in the EU. Now we hope 
to have the support of the U.S. government." 
</P>
<P>
 Their hopes are pinned in part on a trade action filed by an American firm, 
Chiquita Brands International of Cincinnati, which markets "dollar bananas," as 
the Latin fruits are called because most of them are marketed by American 
corporations. Chiquita filed a complaint with the U.S. Trade Representative's 
office, which launched an investigation into the European Union's banana import 
scheme in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiquita says its European sales have dropped 50% since the European import 
rules were imposed in 1993, and it has been joined in the complaint by the 
Hawaii Banana Industry Assn., which claims to be suffering from a glut of Latin 
American bananas on the U.S. market. They had been bound for Europe, but the 
tariff wall there sent them flooding to America instead and driving down prices 
for the domestic Hawaiian product, according to a Chiquita spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when European countries bought bananas where they pleased. 
France and Spain generally grew their own in Martinique, Guadeloupe and the 
Canary Islands; Britain and Portugal bought theirs from former colonies, while 
the Germans bought about 95% of theirs from Latin America, where the fruit was 
consistently sweet and cheap. The Germans had no tariffs on bananas. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1993, national import rules were replaced by a general scheme for all 
of Europe as part of the region's move toward a single market. The new rules 
give preferential access to "home-grown" fruit from EU countries and the former 
colonies of Britain and France in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, the 
so-called ACP areas, while placing a tariff on the Latin "dollar bananas." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the barrier, a majority of Europe's bananas still come from Latin 
America, although in the teeth of a stepped tariff. The European banana regime 
allows 2 million tons of the Latin American product into the market each year, 
at a tariff of $122 a ton. Any imports above that face a tariff of $1,037 a 
ton. 
</P>
<P>
 The tariff gate is set aside for 643,000 tons from EU countries and 666,000 
tons from ACP countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade treaty, yet to be implemented, 
permits slightly more Latin bananas to be imported by Europeans -- 2.1 million 
tons. In a special case for this year, the European Union allotment was 
increased to 2.17 million tons after Hurricane Debbie destroyed crops in the 
Windward Islands and French Antilles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the EU in Brussels redistributed import licenses, with about 66.5% 
reserved for traders who have done business in Latin American bananas, 30% for 
traders of EU and ACP bananas and 3.5% to newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the scramble to acquire newcomers' licenses, Germans applied in the names 
of their grandmothers, children and even dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The EU Farm Commission argues that its tariff regime is a fair balance of the 
often competing interests of EU producers and consumers and of ACP and Latin 
American producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany and Chiquita -- and possibly the U.S. government -- disagree, saying 
the regime flies in the face of free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plenty of people are upset by this whole thing," said Joe Hagin, vice 
president of corporate affairs at Chiquita. "A lot of attention has been paid 
to German opposition, but the Benelux countries and Denmark are (also) opposed, 
and the Italians are less than enamored with the regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 "The scheme," added a U.S. trade official who declined to be identified, "is 
very, very damaging to these (Latin American) countries' interests and to 
American interests. They (the EU) are trying to protect former colonies and 
promote marketing in certain European countries. Well, that is not what GATT is 
all about." 
</P>
<P>
 If the U.S. government determines that the rules are discriminatory, various 
options are open, including taking the case to the World Trade Organization, 
which will succeed GATT next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans challenged the market regime in the European Court of Justice, but 
lost their case when the court endorsed the EU rules in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Boysen, of the German fruit traders council, said German prices for bananas 
have gone up 40% to 50% in the last two years and, consequently, sales have 
dropped by 50% since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Bananas, which cost about 59 cents a pound in the United States, sell for 
between $1.06 and $1.21 a pound in Germany.

PHOTO STUDENTS MEET INDIA -- UP CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What does it take to cover the story of India's 900 million people? Try three 
months, 19 roving photography students and nearly 5,000 rolls of film. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara did when it sent 
the photo-documentary students abroad last summer. Whitney Old (left, with 
cattle) and other Brooks students fanned across the country, from strife-torn 
Kashmir to the rugged Himalayas to bustling Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
 On this page are a few pieces of the mosaic of modern India that they 
produced. Brooks, a private, 49-year-old college with about 450 students, plans 
to display their work in May at its Jefferson campus, 1321 Alameda Padre Serra, 
Santa Barbara.

THREE AFTERSHOCKS OF JAN. 17 QUAKE RATTLE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three aftershocks of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake bumped and rolled 
through the San Fernando Valley within minutes of each other Monday night, 
sending out shock waves felt throughout the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 No serious damage or injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The first quake, a magnitude 3.5, was centered three miles east northeast of 
San Fernando at 7:36 p.m., said Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
 The second, magnitude 3, struck the same area at 7:48 p.m., followed by a 
magnitude 4.5 seconds later, centered three miles east of San Fernando, Hutton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblors occurred "in a very active part of the Northridge aftershock 
zone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton characterized the temblors as a "sequence within a sequence," meaning 
that while all of them were aftershocks of the Northridge quake, the smaller 
quakes Monday night were "foreshocks," a prelude to the third and biggest one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time we have a quake in Southern California, there is a 5% chance that it 
will be followed by a bigger quake," Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been a "fairly steady decline" in frequency of aftershocks 
since the initial series ended in January, such aftershocks could continue for 
at least two years, she said. Monday's was the 57th aftershock of magnitude 4 
or greater. 
</P>
<P>
 The quakes were felt from the Santa Clarita Valley to Venice and into 
southeastern Los Angeles County. They also were felt as far west as Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest quake emptied the 600-seat theater of the Television Academy of 
Arts and Sciences in North Hollywood, where several hundred people rushed out 
of a special Disney anniversary screening, said Jerry Ough, who was in 
attendance.

VIDEO OF WOMEN IN FIRE TRAINING ASSAILED; PERSONNEL: TAPE SHOWS FEMALE RECRUITS 
HAVING TROUBLE WITH PHYSICAL TASKS AT ACADEMY WHILE MEN DO WELL. LOS ANGELES 
CITY OFFICIALS CALL FOR INQUIRY INTO ITS MAKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials Monday called for an outside investigation of the Los Angeles 
City Fire Department to determine who produced and circulated an edited 
training video that critics say is intended to show that women are not tough 
enough for the grueling job of fighting fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong video -- dubbed "female follies" -- was made from footage shot in 
May, 1993, during training exercises at the Fire Academy. The tape, which has 
been shown at a number of fire stations, presents scene after scene of women 
having difficulty performing certain duties -- spliced with occasional footage 
of men accomplishing similar tasks with little trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who have seen the video and are pictured in it said the footage was shot 
by one of the lead training captains, who recorded both male and female 
recruits during the 10-hour course of each daily training session. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry city officials said Monday that the tape appears to have been made for 
the sole purpose of humiliating and ridiculing women, portraying them as 
incapable of handling vital tasks. They say the tape's existence demonstrates 
the kind of hostility women face daily in the 3,100-member force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It speaks to the very issue of institutional sexism," said City Councilman 
Mark Ridley-Thomas, who has viewed the tape. He said he plans to call for 
someone outside the Fire Department to determine who made the tape and how 
widely it has been distributed.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who heads the council's Personnel Committee, 
said she also believes an investigation of the matter is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion that tape is the essence of a hostile environment," Goldberg 
said she concluded after watching the video. "I have to tell you candidly, I 
was at first sad, then very angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Chief Dean E. Cathey, a department spokesman, said Monday that fire 
officials investigated the incident several weeks ago and concluded that there 
was no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The distribution of the tape appears to be an innocent attempt to provide 
(recruits) with video documentation (of their experiences) during the academy," 
said Cathey, explaining that it was made for the academy's graduation party. 
"The tape was not created to provide an atmosphere of intimidation or show any 
firefighters in a bad light." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Commissioner Leslie Song Winner said Monday that she too had seen the 
video and feels an investigation is appropriate. "I was tremendously concerned 
and very disturbed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The video is the latest chapter in a growing controversy that has engulfed the 
Fire Department since the release last month of a harshly worded city audit of 
the agency's hiring and promotion practices. The Personnel Department study 
concluded that white males dominate the department's top posts and that women 
and minorities have been harassed and given unfair evaluations by supervisors, 
all in an effort to run them off the force. 
</P>
<P>
 The existence of the videotape was disclosed in the audit, which quoted a 
firefighter who said copies were floating around firehouses but did not mention 
how widely distributed they were or who made them. The firefighter referred to 
the video as "female follies." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Donald O. Manning has dismissed the audit's findings as the 
grumblings of a few anonymous firefighters and former employees. He has said he 
is proud of the department's record of hiring women, maintaining that his 
recruitment program for females is a national model and that the department has 
more female firefighters than any other force in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven of the 28 female recruits in the class that was videotaped graduated 
and became members of the department. Yet the film fails to show any woman 
successfully completing any training exercise. Instead, it presents only 
negative images. In one scene, a female fire recruit -- a chain saw slung over 
one shoulder and a 40-pound air bottle hanging dangerously on one side of her 
back -- slowly climbs a 100-foot ladder. As she scales the top rung into the 
window of a building, an ax strapped to her waist gets caught in the rungs and 
she finds herself dangling, trying desperately to untangle herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In another scene, a female recruit, legs and arms trembling, lifts a heavy 
wooden ladder but falls to her knees as it crashes on her head. 
</P>
<P>
 In another sequence, a female recruit injures her left shoulder after lifting 
a wooden ladder. Grimacing in pain, she takes off her bulky protective coat and 
is attended to by two training instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 One shot shows several women, each decked out in bulky garb and wearing an air 
bottle and face mask, chopping away at thick wooden logs. Some of them appear 
so tired that they are not swinging their axes, but just letting them fall on 
the wood. A male training instructor is pictured apparently shouting at one of 
the women. 
</P>
<P>
 The footage moves to a large male firefighter, who cuts a thin log in half 
with a single powerful blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men made mistakes too," said Kay Harter, 22, a former recruit who is featured 
in some of the scenes and was booted from the academy. "They fell down, but 
they don't show that." 
</P>
<P>
 Harter said she thinks the purpose of the tape was "just to break us down."  
</P>
<P>
 She and other women then in training said it was their understanding that 
footage was being shot for a graduation video. But apparently the producer made 
more than one tape -- one for the graduation ceremony that the women say showed 
positive highlights, and one for the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harter: "They made it to pass around and make fun of us."

FINDING A REFUGE IN WORDS; CULTURE: WRITERS WORKSHOP PROVIDES NURTURING 
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THOSE BATTERED BY LIVING AMONG GANGS CAN SHARE THEIR PAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story being read to the audience is about a homeboy named Li'l Beto who 
played clarinet in the school band and dreamed of becoming a musician and a 
gangster. 
</P>
<P>
 At 15, Li'l Beto chose the latter, a decision that cost him his life. One 
Sunday morning, while friends played baseball at the park, Li'l Beto lay in a 
gutter, his fragile body cut nearly in two by a shotgun blast. 
</P>
<P>
 The story, while tragic, hardly fazes the half a dozen people seated around 
the table. Instead, it strikes a familiar chord among these poets and 
playwrights from the street, all members of the writers workshop at the 
Homeland Cultural Center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Saturday for the last five years, homeboys, homegirls and others have 
flocked to this refurbished artist's studio near Anaheim Street, armed with sad 
and chilling tales about la vida loca -- the crazy life. 
</P>
<P>
 For the writers, the workshop doubles as a sort of communion where they can 
unload their burdens among people they regard as family. One at a time, they 
open their notebooks and read about worlds they keep guarded outside this room. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the story about Sleepy, who goes to prison at 18 for a murder friends 
say he didn't commit, only to return a heroin addict. And the play about Angel, 
a frightened 15-year-old who refuses to call police after her boyfriend has 
raped her. And the poem about 7-year-old Mario, who plays dead on the bathroom 
floor as his drunken father points a shotgun at his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Ybarra Jr., now 21, writes about his reaction to his father and that 
ugly incident in the autobiographical poem "Shotgun": "I remember, I wished I 
could kill him. Pick up his gun and just kill him."  
</P>
<P>
 The workshop participants are a mixture of young and old, virtuous and 
criminal. Among the core of eight to 10 writers is a single mother on welfare, 
determined to earn a college degree and become a kindergarten teacher despite a 
10-year absence from school. Her fellow storytellers include a convict who 
writes from prison and his girlfriend, who reads his work to the group and 
tape-records the reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Workshop director Manazar Gamboa is himself a former convict who serves as a 
father figure to the writers, a man with a keen appreciation for the streets 
where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city-funded workshop initially attracted writers from 
neighborhoods around the Homeland center, it has gained a modest following 
through word-of-mouth and now includes people from Wilmington, Glendale and 
Cypress. Today, the writers -- ages 12 to 60 -- take their work on the road, 
reading at cultural festivals and bookstores in Long Beach and Los Angeles. 
They have published one collection of poems, and a second one is due out later 
this month.  
</P>
<P>
 Few of these novice scribes ever dreamed of writing stories, let alone poetry. 
Most have spent their lives on the fringe, dropping in and out of school or 
struggling to eke out a living in the impoverished sprawl of central Long 
Beach, where drug dealers and guns are as much a part of the landscape as the 
streets themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these people have gone through pretty hard situations," said Gamboa, 
who spent nearly two decades behind bars for a variety of crimes, including 
armed robbery. "I know, because I experienced it myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the writers say they were intimidated at first by the written word -- 
uncertain if they could get thoughts down on paper or whether their ideas would 
be any good. Indeed, much of the writing is unpolished on first reading -- raw 
impressions about daily life, scribbled on pieces of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But powerful stories also emerge from the poets' notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are tales by the prison inmate who belongs to the group. The man, a 
veterano gang member from Long Beach who asked that his name not be used, hopes 
his writing will deliver a message to young homeboys: Avoid trouble, or end up 
dead or locked away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't listen to nobody when I was out there," said the 29-year-old man, 
who is serving a five-year sentence in North Kern State Prison near Bakersfield 
for a drug conviction. "I think if one person listens, that's at least one 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 The man said he was inspired to write the story about Li'l Beto, the young 
homeboy who played the clarinet, because of the cavalier attitude toward death 
he saw on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, Li'l Beto chose to be a gangster like me," he writes in the story, 
"Yo Soy el Cholo" (I Am the Cholo). "And just like a gangster lives, a gangster 
dies. And to all you youngsters out there, acting like little 'foolios' that 
think this can't happen to you, think again! . . . We play for keeps! If you 
lose, you pay with death! And if you win, you'll probably end up spending the 
rest of your life in prison with the other winners. Your best bet is to not 
play at all!" 
</P>
<P>
 For Deborah Sanchez, the group has provided an opportunity to cast attention 
on the poor and outcast whose lives might otherwise go unnoticed. Sanchez, a 
single mother, raised her son in the Dana Strand public housing project in 
Wilmington while she attended college and law school. She relied on welfare and 
part-time jobs to pay rent, and scholarships and loans for tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the 35-year-old Sanchez is a prosecutor in the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office. But she remembers the humiliation during law school of 
appearing for job interviews in jeans -- the only clothes she could afford -- 
when others arrived in sleek suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Her work is about the world she comes from and people who, like her, were 
disadvantaged. In one poem, "Yesterday's News," she recalls her days in the 
housing project, waiting with a neighbor named Vicki for the mailman to arrive 
with welfare checks. 
</P>
<P>
 " Vicki clings to the edge of the world trying to convince me nobody cares , 
that no one will come to save us , but I still believe that I am not forgotten 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so we talk about yesterday's news, like it was a good movie, saving the 
stories about what we saw outside our window last night for some other time 
when the calmness has vanished."  
</P>
<P>
 Like Sanchez, other members of the group also use their writing to find relief 
from personal pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorena Trejo, the single mother on welfare studying to become a kindergarten 
teacher, has relied on poems and stories to cope with bouts of depression. 
Trejo lives alone with her 5-year-old daughter in a cramped apartment in Long 
Beach. Writing, she says, helps her vent frustrations she could not broach at 
home or with friends.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some people go jogging. Some people listen to music. I write," said Trejo, 
28, whose boyfriend has been locked up most of the 13 years they have been a 
couple. "I pull out pen and pencils and let it go on paper." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first poems she wrote after stumbling onto the Homeland group four 
years ago dealt with visits to her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate being in this situation," she wrote in "Separation." 
</P>
<P>
 "Men are seated on one side and families on the other . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Some cry, some smile, others appear to be happy, but inside they're feeling 
helpless . . . "What causes you to keep coming back to this place? Freedom is 
so much better . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 Trejo's involvement in the group also helped her academically. She barely 
squeaked by in high school with Cs and Ds, avoiding assignments out of a fear 
of writing. By participating in group writing assignments at Homeland, in which 
she explored her personal life, Trejo says, she gained confidence in her 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, certain that she can express herself on a blank page, Trejo is 
enthusiastic about her classes at Long Beach City College, where she is a 
freshman. In one class, Trejo recently volunteered to read a personal essay 
aloud, something that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Trejo, others credit the close-knit group at Homeland with helping to 
build their confidence. "The workshop always helps me discover things about 
myself," said Melissa Bates, 30, who travels from Cypress to read her poetry 
and the work of her boyfriend, the prison inmate. "It has changed my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Trejo put it: "This is where we do our healing." 
</P>
<P>
 Friendships have grown beyond Homeland's front door. Writers now keep in close 
touch outside the workshop and say they look forward to Saturday afternoons, 
when the group meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really big thing to come here and see everybody," said Tina 
Demirdjian, who comes from Glendale. "It feels really good to come home. It's 
like growing up as babies." 
</P>
<P>
 The writers credit Gamboa, the workshop's energetic leader, with creating an 
intimate atmosphere and keeping the group running so long. 
</P>
<P>
 When the workshops are in progress, it is clear Gamboa is in charge. He does 
not hesitate to tell writers to shut up when they are disruptive. But he also 
encourages the tentative ones. "Slow down, homeboy," he told one burly 
teen-ager at a recent session as the youth mumbled quickly through a poem. 
"Read loud, homeboy." 
</P>
<P>
 The 60-year-old Gamboa, a striking figure with a stark white beard and a mane 
of bushy gray hair, says his bumpy life has given him an appreciation for the 
pressures faced by many in the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamboa, who lives in Silver Lake, spent 17 years in California prisons for a 
number of offenses including possession of heroin. During four prison stints, 
he found salvation in writing. He studied grammar, poetry, psychology, history, 
always with dictionaries at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearly 20 years he has remained crime-free, Gamboa has published 
collections of his own poetry, run writing workshops for juvenile offenders and 
served as president of Beyond Baroque, a well-known literary group in Venice. 
He established the Homeland writers workshop in 1989 after the center's 
director, Dixie Swift, saw his work in a poetry magazine and asked him to start 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since, Gamboa has developed close personal ties with several 
members of the workshop, who say he understands their problems as few others 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, Manazar is able to reach me like the (high school) teachers 
couldn't," Trejo said. "He is familiar with the lifestyle I have been through." 
</P>
<P>
 The inmate who participates in the workshop looks to Gamboa as a sort of role 
model. As Gamboa did in prison, the man keeps a dictionary in his cell and uses 
the reference book to learn new words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people like me are not going to make it out there," the convict said of 
life outside prison walls. "Manazar beat the odds. There ain't too many people 
like that, and I want to be one of them."

ANTI-GANG AGENCY MAY LOSE COUNTY FUNDS; BUDGETS: HOPE IN YOUTH PLANS TO LAY OFF 
HALF ITS STAFF UNLESS SUPERVISORS PROVIDE A $1.9-MILLION EXTENSION. SOME 
OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE, CITING A 
LACK OF COMMUNITY VISIBILITY. 
</P>

<P>
 Hope in Youth, the year-old organization whose unprecedented fund-raising 
muscle helped create the largest anti-gang program in Los Angeles County, is in 
danger of losing a key government backer, potentially forcing it to disband a 
substantial part of its effort early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization says it will lay off about half of its 120-member field staff 
if the County Board of Supervisors does not act soon to extend its funding.  
</P>
<P>
 But the board -- citing an uncertain budget picture -- appears to be in no 
mood to spend $1.9 million to keep the program intact through June. 
</P>
<P>
 The troublesome financial picture casts a shadow on Hope in Youth's five-year 
goal: an unprecedented infusion of nearly 500 social workers into the county's 
more desperate neighborhoods, where they would concentrate on troubled young 
people who had not joined gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope in Youth's organizers, who have gone as far as Washington to get their 
group included in this year's federal crime bill, are not expected to give up 
easily. In past funding fights they have packed government hearing rooms with 
cheering supporters and have had Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and other religious 
leaders lobby politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's director, Greg Fitzgerald, said he is baffled as to why the 
county might cease funding the program just as it is making a positive 
impression on hundreds of youths.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is something the county ought to be proud of, and I just don't 
understand why they are not," Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope in Youth was designed by three neighborhood organizations and 10 
religious denominations, gaining much of its initial impetus from Mahony, who 
said that government had taken a fragmented approach to gang intervention.  
</P>
<P>
 In five years, the program is supposed to disband, leaving behind community 
groups and new leaders who will help steer teen-agers away from trouble, 
without more government intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 The church-backed program had to lobby hard from the start with government 
leaders who pleaded poverty. Its contract with the county conceded that the 
$2.9 million it was given last year was a "one-time-only obligation."  
</P>
<P>
 Several county officials say they see no reason now to offer more money to a 
group that has already far outstripped funding offered to more experienced 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just haven't seen them out there in the community. We don't know what they 
are doing," said Robert Alaniz, a spokesman for Supervisor Gloria Molina, one 
of the program's chief backers a year ago. "The supervisor is very disappointed 
with the work they have done to date. She would be very hard-pressed at this 
point to support another year of funding." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the other four supervisors have yet offered to even bring the Hope in 
Youth funding request forward for discussion. "Until the budget situation gets 
straightened out, we don't know where we stand," said Supervisor Deane Dana. 
"There is no way the board can vote money with the situation the way it is 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Hope in Youth has made a reputation for anything, it is as a formidable 
political force on the local, state and national levels. Over the objections of 
outgoing Mayor Tom Bradley, it got start-up funding from the Los Angeles City 
Council and a $2.5-million grant from the new city government headed by Mayor 
Richard Riordan. It secured the even-larger grant from the county and $2 
million from the state. Its $7.4-million budget dwarfs the $4 million-plus 
annual budget of Community Youth Gang Services, previously the largest 
anti-gang agency in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The infusion of funds for a group without a track record angered leaders of 
some longtime anti-gang organizations, who said they had to struggle each year 
to obtain a relative pittance from government. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hope in Youth argues that only its more comprehensive network, bolstered 
by support from religious denominations, could begin to counteract the forces 
that have sent about 100,000 of the county's youngsters into gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the program has fielded 40 teams of three social workers. In each 
team, one worker focuses on direct contact with "at-risk" youths in the 
community, another works with parents and the third organizes programs at 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pacoima's Haddon Elementary School, the school organizer now has parents 
staffing an after-school playground period until 6 p.m. to keep youngsters off 
the streets. Elsewhere, about 1,000 adults are involved in weekly classes to 
learn how to be better parents. About 900 children and teen-agers in the 
program are working on community cleanups, job readiness classes and other 
projects, Hope in Youth officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope in Youth hit a few glitches in its start-up, including hiring some 
counselor-social workers who were not qualified, according to two employees of 
a firm that is reviewing the organization's performance for the funding 
agencies. But the agency's overall start-up has been slightly better than 
average, particularly considering that it is larger than any project of its 
kind anywhere in the nation, said Sally Bolus, vice president of the Evaluation 
and Training Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolus said early intervention plans offer "a promising strategy, and we have 
seen some promising signs. But we can't say at this point how effective it's 
going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's money has paid for about 60 of the program's 120 field staff and 
another six office employees -- all of whom will receive layoff notices by 
Christmas if the supervisors do not extend funding, Fitzgerald said.

QUESTIONING OF SIMPSON JURORS ENDS; TRIAL: JUDGE CLEARS POOL OF 44 POTENTIAL 
ALTERNATES. A KEY DNA HEARING IS DELAYED AFTER A DEFENSE SPECIALIST FAILS IN 
HIS EFFORT TO BE EXCUSED FROM A NEW YORK CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The O.J. Simpson murder trial cleared one hurdle and ran smack into another 
Monday: Nearly a month after picking a jury, the judge and lawyers completed 
individual questioning of alternate jurors, but they also were forced to 
postpone an important hearing on DNA evidence until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, selection of alternate jurors for the case -- in which Simpson has 
pleaded not guilty to the June 12 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman -- made slow but steady progress through the day, as it has for 
much of the past several weeks. At the same time, the day featured several 
surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito told attorneys he had scheduled a hearing 
for later this week on the issue of possible juror misconduct by at least one 
of the 12 panelists already picked for the Simpson jury. Although Ito did not 
say what prompted the hearing, he warned prosecutors and defense lawyers that 
"each side must take into account that we may lose some of the originals." 
</P>
<P>
 * Prosecutors turned over a large pile of material to defense attorneys, 
prompting Simpson's lawyers to complain that they were only now receiving 
material that might be important to their case. The material includes a report 
from a police photographer, whose account of a conversation with one of the 
LAPD detectives at the crime scene differed slightly from the detective's 
testimony at Simpson's preliminary hearing. Prosecutors said the report was 
prepared at the request of defense attorneys and was turned over promptly. They 
also denied that it contains anything that undermines the detective's 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 * In New York, one of Simpson's attorneys gave up his battle to delay a trial 
that is keeping him from traveling to Los Angeles to represent Simpson in an 
upcoming DNA hearing. Ito agreed to delay the DNA hearing until early next year 
-- though that delay probably still would not allow the lawyer, Peter J. 
Neufeld, to be present. Meantime, the two sides will debate a number of other 
legal issues, including the admissibility of evidence relating to alleged 
spousal abuse of Nicole Simpson by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 As lawyers slogged through the final jury candidates Monday, they finally 
concluded their individual questioning of panelists -- a process that began in 
October and has since occupied the judge and attorneys. Jury selection has 
proved grueling at times, with many candidates expressing a willingness to 
serve but then being dropped because they had strong opinions about the case or 
because they had difficulty with some of the legal concepts behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 The first prospect up Monday, for instance, was a 54-year-old grandmother who 
insisted that she could serve on the panel even though she recently took 
custody of five grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito at first was ready to accept the woman on the panel, but then excused her 
after she said her religious beliefs would make it impossible for her to 
convict a criminal defendant unless the evidence was so overwhelming as to 
leave no doubt whatsoever -- a standard beyond what the law requires. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that woman became the latest of more than 100 jury candidates 
dismissed since jury selection began in late September, three other prospective 
panelists were accepted, bringing the pool to 44, two short of the number Ito 
hoped to have by Wednesday, when attorneys for the two sides are scheduled to 
begin exercising peremptory challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before it became clear that the pool was smaller than what Ito had 
sought, the judge announced that he was prepared to go forward with that group. 
The panel of 44 prospective alternates includes 24 men and 20 women. It is made 
up of 23 blacks, nine whites, eight Latinos, three Asian Americans and one 
woman of mixed race. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the prospective jurors who was cleared Monday for possible service on 
the panel is an 82-year-old man who said that years ago he served as the jury 
foreman in a trial of Elmer (Geronimo) Pratt, a member of the Black Panther 
Party convicted of murder who continues to maintain his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of Simpson's lead attorneys, has represented 
Pratt, but the prospective juror interviewed Monday was not on the panel that 
deliberated the murder case. Instead, the man said he heard a case involving 
allegations that Pratt was involved in a prison riot while in custody. The jury 
found Pratt not guilty, the man said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man's account was questioned by Pratt's attorneys, however, who said Pratt 
never had been charged with such a crime. In San Francisco, an associate of 
Pratt's longtime appellate lawyer said she thought that the man might be 
referring to another case involving members of the Black Panther Party accused 
of starting a prison riot, but that case did not involve Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
 While the final jury candidates were being cleared for service in Los Angeles, 
Neufeld, one of Simpson's DNA lawyers, conceded defeat in a war of wills with a 
New York judge after making one last attempt to prevail, this time by asking 
the judge to recuse himself. Far from defusing the situation, however, the 
request only angered the jurist, Supreme Court Judge Harold J. Rothwax, yet 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothwax refused to take himself off the case and remained adamant that Neufeld 
must stay in New York rather than fly to California for DNA hearings scheduled 
to begin next week. Faced with Rothwax's determination, Neufeld's attorney, 
William Kunstler, threw in the towel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think we could move another court to take action on this," Kunstler 
said Monday, reluctantly conceding defeat just a few days after vowing to 
pursue the matter through the New York state courts. "It just appeared futile." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys complained that they were not prepared to embark upon an 
important hearing over DNA evidence without Neufeld, one of two DNA experts on 
the former football star's defense team. As a result, they asked Ito to delay 
that hearing, which had been scheduled to start Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothwax has estimated that the New York trial could last five weeks, but 
Simpson's lawyers only asked that the DNA hearing be put off until Jan. 4, when 
court reconvenes after a scheduled Christmas break. Ito agreed to the delay but 
did not set a specific date for the DNA hearing to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 If it starts in early January, that could mean that Simpson will not receive 
Neufeld's services for the DNA hearing, but every postponement prolongs the 
football Hall of Famer's anxious wait for the trial to begin and further 
complicates the task of insulating jurors in the case from publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has instructed members of the jury panel to avoid publicity about the 
case, but some have found it difficult to cut themselves off entirely. Once the 
DNA hearing begins, it could last more than a month, so jurors may not return 
to the courtroom until February. Meanwhile, they are governed only by their 
pledge to abide by Ito's orders about what they can and cannot watch or read. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With so much publicity involving the case and with a potentially long trial 
contemplated, both sides have acknowledged that some of the original 12 jurors 
might be lost before the case can be concluded. But comments in the courtroom 
Monday suggested that at least one panelist might be dismissed even before the 
jury is called to begin hearing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be losing someone from our panel of 12," Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither she nor Ito provided specifics, but Ito set that matter for a hearing 
Thursday. The two sides also will then consider a defense motion challenging 
the addition of Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden to the prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
 As the legal battles unfolded on opposite sides of the continent, Lou Brown, 
father of murder victim Nicole Simpson, refuted a tabloid report that his 
daughter had drafted a letter to a lawyer in which she allegedly said that if 
she were found dead, it would be Simpson who had killed her. 
</P>
<P>
 That report, an exasperated Brown said, is "absolutely not true. It's a bunch 
of junk. Where they came up with it, I don't know."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BELL GARDENS; EX-CASINO 
EMPLOYEE GETS 12 1/2 YEARS IN USURY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former employee of the Bicycle Club casino in Bell Gardens was sentenced 
Monday to more than 12 1/2 years in federal prison after being convicted of 
conspiracy, loan-sharking and extortion in connection with loans to gamblers at 
exorbitant interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon sentenced Hollman Cheung, 42, of Hacienda 
Heights to a maximum 151 months in prison and imposed a $150,000 fine.A federal 
court jury in September found Cheung guilty of nine criminal counts after 
prosecutors proved that Cheung and several associates would "loan money at 
usurious rates" to gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Marc R. Greenberg said Cheung agreed to establish a 
$100,000 restitution fund to repay victims who had been forced to pay up to 10% 
interest every three days on gambling debts. Victims who were pressured to deed 
over property can seek to recover their holdings, he said. Leftover funds will 
be donated to a treatment program for addicted gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged that Cheung and others engaged in loan-sharking and 
extortion until February, 1993, nearly three years after the U.S. government 
seized the casino following proof that it was built in part with $12 million in 
laundered drug money.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; BURT REYNOLDS 
SEEKS REDUCTION IN CHILD SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor Burt Reynolds said his net worth has dropped from $7.5 million to $2 
million in the red in six months. Until he can make a comeback, he said, he 
cannot afford the $15,000 a month he pays in child support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like every American, I'm having a cash-flow problem right now," Reynolds 
testified Monday at a custody and child-support hearing in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who made more than $43 million between 1988 and 1994, court records 
show, is seeking a reduction in support he pays for his adopted son Quinton, 6, 
whose custody he shares with former wife, actress Loni Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds and Anderson, whose bitter breakup two years ago generated tabloid 
headlines for months, entered the courtroom of Judge Robert M. Letteau through 
separate doors. Anderson, scheduled to testify later in the week, had no 
comment about the legal wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds' testimony about his finances was marked by alternating quips and 
memory lapses. "My IQ seems to have dropped 100 points since I got up here," 
the actor said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said he has no movie offers pending, and little money trickling in 
from residuals. But he insisted that he may be down, but he is not out.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ABANDONED HOUSE USED AS 
GANG HAVEN IS DEMOLISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EFRAIN HERNANDEZ JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly before the large, beaten-up Victorian home best known as a gang haven 
took its first hit from a bulldozer Monday, Mary Lou Trevis was beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the graffiti-covered, burned-out, abandoned building at 1508 
Pennsylvania Ave. in Boyle Heights deserved to go. For about the past two 
years, city officials said, the building had been controlled by Primera Flats 
gang members who terrorized the neighborhood with violence and intimidation. 
The crimes occurring in the house and in surrounding areas included murder, 
rape and robberies. The house sometimes served as a refuge for addicts and 
runaways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want this type of activity to continue to take place in our 
community," said Trevis, president of the Neighborhood Watch Advisory Council, 
which covers Boyle Heights and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Trevis, city officials hailed the demolition as a way to alert gangs that 
the takeover of private property -- abandoned or not -- is unacceptable in Los 
Angeles. A steady pressure on such illegal activities may help stem rampant 
disregard for the law and improve city neighborhoods, they said. Councilman 
Richard Alatorre, whose 14th District includes the site, said cooperation among 
city departments expedited the effort to do something in response to repeated 
complaints from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the building, whose owner was identified by city officials as 
a company called 2794 Properties, was built in the early 1900s as a 
single-family home. It was vacant for at least the past several years except 
for gang members and others who began using it during 1992, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said that in November, 1992, there was a fatal shooting outside 
the house when two members of a rival gang tried to attend a party being thrown 
by Primera Flats. In October, the house was severely damaged in an arson fire. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear Monday whether 2794 Properties, which could not be reached for 
comment, had plans for the site. Whatever the future of the site, several city 
officials and residents felt a strong sense of accomplishment as the building 
came down.  
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Rick Faulkner of the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollenbeck Division 
said the demolition of one building can initiate more substantial changes later 
as residents gain confidence in authorities.  
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Gutierrez, 45, co-owner of an apartment building across an alley from 
the gang haven, said the demolition was necessary. But whether conditions 
improve in the neighborhood depends, he said, on the city fostering more 
improvements there. 
</P>
<P>
 If things don't improve, he said, selling his own building may become his only 
option.  
</P>
<P>
 Others definitely weren't convinced that the demolition would do any good. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they're doing is knocking down a building. Nothing's going to change," 
said Jess Martinez, 21, who has lived across from the building all his life. 
"To me, this is all fake." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Ruiz, 18, who watched the demolition, said he and his friends had spent 
many days and nights "kickin' it" at the abandoned house. The rooftop often 
became the spot for late-night talks about plans and dreams, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They can take away the house, but they can't take us away from the 
neighborhood," said Ruiz, who sported a "Primera" tattoo across his belly along 
with a vertical scar from an operation to remove a bullet two months ago. "A 
lot of things happened in there."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUDGE 
ORDERS CITY COUNCIL TO REVEAL KEY DELIBERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge ordered the Los Angeles City Council on Monday to reveal the 1992 
discussions that led up to its vote to pay punitive damages levied against 
ex-Police Chief Daryl Gates and nine officers.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts said the deliberations will be kept from 
the public, but need to be disclosed before he can rule on whether council 
members are responsible for fostering a policy of police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 The case stems from a shootout involving members of the LAPD's Special 
Investigations Section. Three suspected robbers were killed and a fourth was 
wounded after the Feb. 12, 1990, holdup at a McDonald's restaurant in Sunland.  
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of the trial will determine if 4-year-old Johanna Trevino, 
whose father was among the robbers shot dead, should receive damages from the 
city and the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The second will deal with the council's April 22, 1992, vote to pay about 
$44,000 in punitive damages levied against Gates and the officers. Lawyers for 
the city contend the council members do not need to reveal what they said 
during closed sessions.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY OF INDUSTRY; MAN 
KILLED BY DEPUTIES IN SHOOTOUT OUTSIDE BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 24-year-old Upland man who apparently shot and wounded another man outside a 
bar early Monday morning was shot and killed by sheriff's deputies after he 
began firing at them, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose identity was not released because his relatives had not been 
notified, died outside the Fantasia nightclub at 17500 Castleton St. at 1:30 
a.m., sheriff's spokeswoman Britta Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded man, Reginald Parker, 21, of Pomona, was in stable condition with 
a gunshot wound to his buttocks, Tubbs said. Several disturbances had been 
reported that night at the club and the management had agreed to shut down an 
hour early at 1 a.m. to prevent other problems, Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies were helping to escort about 300 patrons outside when a fistfight 
broke out in front of the club, Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 While breaking up the fight, deputies heard gunfire from the parking lot. As 
they began searching for the source, one deputy saw a man armed with a 
semiautomatic handgun shoot another man lying on the ground, Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man then turned toward the deputies, pointed his gun at them and began 
shooting, Tubbs said. Four deputies returned fire with 9-millimeter handguns, 
striking the man several times in the upper torso.

MAJOR SHUFFLE OF LAPD OFFICIALS EXPECTED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a dozen mid- to high-level Los Angeles Police Department officials 
will receive new assignments today in the next major phase of Chief Willie L. 
Williams' shake-up of the force, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the shifts merely formalize Williams' controversial announcement in 
September that he would reorganize the department, notably the installation of 
Deputy Chief Ronald Banks as the LAPD's second-highest-ranking official. 
Williams notified City Council members of the shifts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although creation of a new position such as the one for Banks normally would 
require council approval, the announcements expected by Williams do not depend 
on council action. That is because of a top-level vacancy at the department, 
created when Williams abruptly demoted Assistant Chief Bernard Parks in 
September -- a move that plunged the chief into the biggest controversy of his 
2 1/2-year-old administration. 
</P>
<P>
 To complete his reorganization, however, Williams will need to submit parts of 
the plan to the City Council because he intends to change the department's 
structure, having three assistant chiefs instead of two. The additional 
position will cost more, and the council has the power to consider all funding 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Williams brings that part of his proposal to the council, he will be 
going before a body that no longer includes a potentially difficult adversary. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a vocal critic of Williams, was sworn 
in as a county supervisor. Yaroslavsky chaired the council's Budget Committee, 
but his job change ensures that the Police Department will not have to confront 
him over Williams' reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Banks' promotion would be the most visible of the changes, it comes 
amid a host of shifting assignments. Tim McBride, the popular commanding 
officer of the LAPD's Air Support Division, will take over as the department's 
chief spokesman, a position vacated when Cmdr. David J. Gascon was promoted to 
deputy chief and assumed responsibility for the department's expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of department captains also will be transferred, as will its 
highest-ranking woman. Detective Robert Kimball will move from Internal Affairs 
to Bunco-Forgery; he will swap jobs with Capt. Margaret York, the LAPD's 
highest-ranking woman, who will inherit the sensitive Internal Affairs post. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this week, another round of changes could complete the reorganization, 
officials said. Those changes probably would include the promotion of Deputy 
Chief Bayan Lewis to the rank of assistant chief. He would be in charge of the 
LAPD's Office of Operations, which oversees 80% of all officers in the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 That move would require council backing because Lewis would become the third 
assistant chief in a department only authorized for two.

YAROSLAVSKY SWORN IN AS COUNTY SUPERVISOR; POLITICS: FORMER L.A. CITY 
COUNCILMAN OUTLINES AMBITIOUS GOALS. IN A SEPARATE CEREMONY, SHERIFF SHERMAN 
BLOCK TAKES OATH OF OFFICE FOR FOURTH TERM. 
</P>

<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky, the man who would shake up a county government that has 
resisted the efforts of many a would-be reformer, took the oath of office as a 
Los Angeles County supervisor Monday in a casual ceremony before an audience 
packed with Los Angeles' political and business elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky served notice that he intends to scrutinize nearly every aspect of 
county operations and will be a vocal advocate for constituents in his 3rd 
District, which stretches from the San Fernando Valley to Hollywood to the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old former city councilman, who very nearly has grown up on the 
local political scene, was introduced humorously by Mayor Richard Riordan as a 
"capable young man." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a man of relentless energy and integrity," said the mayor, one who is 
known for his "mastery of the budget" and "blunt advice, which he so freely 
shares." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky will need all of that energy and candor if he is to get his new 
colleagues to go along with an ambitious slate of initiatives that he outlined 
in seven pages of prepared remarks at his Hall of Administration swearing-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky vowed to open up county government, enact a comprehensive campaign 
finance reform law, overhaul the county budget process, clean house at the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, reorder the county's public health 
priorities and eliminate the partisanship in which the board has long operated. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky scolded county officials for "erecting barriers between the people 
of Los Angeles County and its government." He lamented that the county's 
"fiscal mismanagement has become painfully aware to everyone," criticized the 
county's lobbying efforts in Sacramento and Washington as "woefully inadequate" 
and urged his colleagues to "transcend ideology and outdated allegiances and 
come together to find solutions that work." 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-minute speech won generally high marks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a marvelous speech, an inspirational swearing-in," said Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. "I think he's going to make a real difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky pledged to make law enforcement a top priority, and among those 
applauding his remarks was Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, who, in a 
separate ceremony Monday, was sworn in for a fourth term.  
</P>
<P>
 Block, 70, assured a crowd at the California Room in the L.A. Mart that 
included law enforcement officials and Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, that he is in 
good health after a bout with cancer last year that left many wondering if he 
would be capable of leading the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheriff really is back," Block told the cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The department in recent years has been buffeted by challenges and 
controversy, including Block's ill health, the 1992 riots, high crime rates and 
shrinking departmental budgets. The department came under intense scrutiny 
after a string of deputy-involved shootings that led to charges of excessive 
use of force. A special task force, the Kolts Commission, found widespread 
problems and urged reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Block said Monday that he considers the department one of the best in 
the country and promised new programs designed to reduce crime and juvenile 
delinquency.

COLUMN RIGHT/ DAVID WALSH: COMMON SENSE MUST TAME THE SCIENCE GENIE; IN THE

 President Clinton deserves credit for the leadership he displayed in 
unilaterally prohibiting federal funds for the creation of human research 
embryos. The President's decision was issued on the same day that a federal 
advisory panel to the National Institutes of Health had voted to fund such 
research under some circumstances. Clinton's action publicly overrode the 
prestige of the scientific research community in the name of citizen common 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the recent election results played a role in stiffening the 
President's spine. But he rose to the occasion and in the process illustrated 
the crucial importance of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty arises from the unquestioned authority enjoyed by science and 
scientists in contemporary society. This is one of the inevitable consequences 
of their central role in providing many of the tangible improvements in human 
life that we have come to enjoy and expect. But it carries a cost. When even 
the benefits of human life itself are to be determined by science, it is the 
ultimate case of the tail wagging the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a pressure to which we are all more or less subject, for we have been 
brought up in a society that recognized only one definitive and unquestioned 
source of knowledge -- science. It is difficult for even a President to take 
the lead in resisting what the particular scientific community declares to be 
necessary. Such resistance is bound to appear reactionary, a concession to 
brute political prejudice or an outburst of sheer irrational fear. The 
perception cannot be otherwise so long as we continue to recognize science as 
the one unchallenged source of knowledge, the only impartial font of reason. 
Disputes over the creation of experimental human embryos and other biomedical 
horrors will never be resolved until we recognize that scientific rationality 
is not the only source of knowledge available to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Science, even for scientists, is only a part of human life. It is a way of 
investigating reality through analysis and experimentation that yields insights 
and results of impressive reliability. As such, it occurs within the larger 
context of human life, which is structured by a common-sense understanding of 
who we are and what we owe one another. The benefits we expect to obtain from 
scientific knowledge make sense only in relation to this pre-scientific 
community of human life. Science does not create the human beings it purports 
to serve. If it loses sight of that context, then even science itself begins to 
lose its frame of reference.  
</P>
<P>
 Science itself makes sense, in other words, only within a human world that is 
already given. It is not the task of science to fundamentally create or shape 
that world; it must make its contribution to the existing reality of human 
beings. That means that science must recognize limits, moral and common-sense 
limits. Our difficulty as a society is that such limits cannot be justified by 
science and we have not granted comparable status to any other source of 
knowledge. The result is the confusion we witness in which science proposes to 
create some human beings in order to destroy them for the benefit of other 
human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 At root, the problem is not one of science but of politics. We must find a way 
of taming the genie of science, but it must be by virtue of an authority that 
claims intellectual priority, not merely a raw exercise of political power. In 
our society, political power can be sustained only if it is recognized as 
legitimate and reasonable. The limitation of science must be reasonable. What, 
then, can sustain the rationality of the President's decision if it is cut off 
from the support of science itself? 
</P>
<P>
 If he and we wish to see such courageous decisions sustained, then two things 
must be explained. First is the necessity of eliminating the monopolistic 
status of science as a claim to knowledge; we have other sources of knowledge 
that are prior and more embracing and more inescapable. Second is to emphasize 
that the principal alternative form of knowledge available to us is common 
sense, including common-sense morality. Without it, we lose that instinctual 
cautiousness that has enabled generations of human beings to survive. We would 
become like the rats that are specially bred for laboratory experiments. For no 
naturally occurring species can be counted on to so incautiously and recklessly 
press levers, wander through mazes and suck on tubes as part of experiments in 
which they rightly suspect they will eventually be expended. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of such public controversies as this one over experimental embryos 
is that they remind us that humans are never merely components of the 
laboratory of science. Science must serve man, not the reverse.

COLUMN LEFT/ ROBERT L. BOROSAGE: $1.5 TRILLION FOR DEFENSE ISN'T ENOUGH?; 
CLINTON IS KOWTOWING TO CONSERVATIVES AT THE COST OF HIS DOMESTIC AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Priorities, a Washington-based network of 300 organizations calling for a plan 
to reinvest in America.

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has decided that the Pentagon needs more than the $1.5 
trillion it had planned to spend over the next six years. He agreed to add $25 
billion to help keep the troops off food stamps and ready to fight. Republicans 
-- those implacable crusaders against big government -- say this isn't enough; 
the world's most costly bureaucracy needs even more money. Say what? 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the country will spend more than $270 billion on national defense 
-- almost as much as the rest of the world combined. (With our allies, we 
consume more than 80% of the world's military spending.) Russia's collapsing 
forces will make do with less than $20 billion. All of the so-called rogue 
nations -- North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Cuba -- are cutting back already 
antiquated military forces. The Brookings Institution estimates we spend more 
than $50 billion a year on forces arrayed to defend South Korea against North 
Korea. The South Koreans spend about $12 billion. Nearing collapse, the North 
has cut its military spending to less than $2 billion. Here, it is a scandal 
when a handful of American military families use food stamps. In North Korea, 
the soldiers struggle simply to find food. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans charge that the Pentagon doesn't have enough money to fight two 
Persian Gulf-sized wars on opposite sides of the globe, at once, without 
allies. That might be worrisome, except that Defense Secretary William Perry 
admitted last spring that the Pentagon can't identify two potentially hostile 
countries with the capacity that Iraq possessed before the Gulf War -- forces 
that we eviscerated in 44 days using 20% of our forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The military is involved in peacekeeping operations in Haiti, Rwanda and the 
Gulf for which it wants more money. As Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) commented, 
the $270 billion we will spend this year simply keeps the Pentagon on retainer, 
like a lawyer. Every time we ask it to do something, it bills extra by the 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 That is how the bogus "readiness" issue arose. Last year, Congress dithered a 
few months before giving the military an extra billion or so to pay for moving 
troops to Rwanda and Haiti. So the Pentagon postponed a round of routine 
exercises for backup military units, reducing the bureaucratic measure of their 
readiness. Republicans howled that the military was going "hollow." But it is 
the threat, not the military, that is hollow. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives of both parties have been shameless in this debate. They accuse 
the President both of "gutting" the military and of using it too much. They 
want a military that costs more and does less. The Pentagon -- the largest 
source of waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government -- has become the 
public-works program conservatives can love. Republicans campaign to spend more 
money on "Star Wars." Soon-to-be House Speaker Newt Gingrich says that big 
government can't do anything right, while arguing that the Pentagon, the 
largest bureaucracy of all, can create and run a flawless missile-defense 
system -- if we just give it a few billions more.  
</P>
<P>
 We pay dearly for this folly. Under current laws, every additional dollar 
given to the military must be cut from domestic programs. The $25 billion 
Clinton just approved adds 1% to Pentagon spending over six years. But on the 
domestic side, it virtually guts what is left of new spending on education and 
training, roads and sewers, research and development that the President rightly 
said were vital to our economic future. 
</P>
<P>
 What the President ought to do is take a broom to the Pentagon stables. 
Dispatch Vice President Al Gore and his "reinventing government" team to the 
Pentagon, which writes seven of 10 federal paychecks. Stop building new weapons 
systems that were designed for a Cold War that is no more. Pare the active-duty 
forces down to sensible numbers -- 1 million or so; cut the civilian 
bureaucrats proportionately. We still could sustain the most powerful military 
in the world, spending four times what any of our allies spend and 10 or more 
times what any potential adversary does. It would also free up as much as $100 
billion a year to get the country back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 But this debate isn't about military prowess; it is about politics. When 
Republicans raise the ante, the President tries to look strong by throwing more 
money in the pot. With Pentagon bureaucrats finagling to get more money and 
Republican presidential wannabes prating about a "hollow military," the stakes 
keep going up. The Pentagon will cash in. And our children will be stuck with 
the tab.

 Short-term interest rates rocketed for a sixth straight trading session 
Monday, pushed by new reports of economic strength and by year-end portfolio 
shifting by institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stock prices were mixed in moderate trading, with the Dow 
industrials easing 3.70 points to 3,741.92 after surging nearly 45 points 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The major action Monday was in the market for shorter-term Treasury 
securities, as yields jumped to their highest levels in nearly four years, 
continuing the pattern of the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 New three-month T-bills were auctioned at a yield of 6%, up from 5.59% just a 
week ago. The yield on one-year T-bills zoomed to 7.12% from 6.99% on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market was responding both to expectations of further rate 
boosts by the Federal Reserve Board in 1995, as the economy continues to boom, 
and to selling of shorter-term securities by banks and other investors 
readjusting their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year Treasury note has come under particular pressure over the past 
week, which traders said suggested that banks -- major owners of two-year notes 
-- were bailing out to raise cash. The two-year T-note yield hit 7.58% on 
Monday, up from 7.44% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, longer-term bond yields were only marginally higher, with the 
30-year T-bond yield at 7.92%, up from Friday's 7.90%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that the narrowing spread between short- and long-term interest 
rates is a classic sign of a market that expects the economy to slow sooner 
rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Many defense stocks rose, which some traders said reflected expectations for 
higher defense spending under the Republican Congress. Raytheon rose 1 to 63 
1/4, Rockwell jumped 1 1/4 to 35 3/4, Boeing gained 1 1/8 to 46 1/2 and Loral 
surged 1 3/8 to 40 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some tech stocks rebounded from their recent drubbing. Intel rose 1 1/4 to 
64 1/8, Micron Technology gained 2 1/4 to 44 1/4, Compaq added 3/4 to 40 7/8 
and Peoplesoft leaped 3 3/8 to 64 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But AT&T fell 3/4 to a new 1994 low of 47 5/8. The long-distance giant asked 
federal regulators to OK a rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average jumped 307.36 points to 19,305.66, 
while Frankfurt's DAX average gained 32.61 points to 2,071.12 and London's 
FTSE-100 index added 16.2 points to 3,033.5. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index was down 16.06 points at 2,521.42. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, silver continued to plummet after last week's dive. 
Near-term futures dropped 11.6 cents to $4.57 an ounce on the New York Merc. 
Gold was unchanged at $375.50.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: BUSINESS GIFTS FROM LAVISH TO TACKY 
</P>

 Forget the fruitcake. 
</P>
<P>
 Business people are spending more money on holiday gifts this year, thanks to 
the vibrant economy and bright prospects for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Hal Berger, a partner at El Segundo-based Image Design Marketing, 
is giving his three best clients $600 Sony camcorders. Berger, who also 
developed the Family Channel's "Masters of the Maze" game show for kids, says 
he fell in love with the camcorder and wanted to share its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 200 business contacts can expect something more modest: a software 
disk featuring a customized, animated Christmas message. Berger and partner 
Gary Yamron also plan on feting their 40 or so employees at a beachfront 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 While you might not be spending thousands of dollars on gifts and parties, it 
pays to put some careful thought and consideration into your business gifts. If 
your budget is limited, sending handwritten holiday cards is much better than 
shipping out a tacky gift. 
</P>
<P>
 To help you make the right choices, we asked business owners, executives and 
journalists across the country to recall some of their best and worst holiday 
presents. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Kehrer, editor of Independent Business magazine in Thousand Oaks: 
</P>
<P>
 "My best gift was a simple card announcing that in lieu of business gifts, the 
firm was donating the money to a private group that provides shelter to 
homeless individuals while helping them find jobs," Kehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
 His worst gift? 
</P>
<P>
 "A box of artery-clogging sausages of unknown origin, in the shape of barnyard 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Kehrer is giving his best clients Mont Blanc fountain pens. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine Velona, director of operations, Fox Television: 
</P>
<P>
 Velona has received some lavish holiday gifts. Among them: luggage, crystal, 
jewelry and gourmet food baskets. But she's also been stuck with a few duds, 
including mugs with company logos, socks, pencils and a box of cranberries. 
</P>
<P>
 What's she giving to her best clients this year? American Express gift 
certificates, crystal, picture frames, perfume or electronic games. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve DeLuca, director of research for Orange County-based Cruttenden & Co.: 
</P>
<P>
 He said his best holiday gift was an economic calendar showing the dates on 
which major economic statistics would be released. 
</P>
<P>
 His worst gift: a paperweight. 
</P>
<P>
 What's he giving this season? 
</P>
<P>
 Bottles of good regional wine to his "top tier" clients and coffee mugs to his 
"mid-tier" clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty DeDominic, president of PDQ Personnel, Los Angeles; president of the 
National Assn. of Women Business Owners: 
</P>
<P>
 "The best gift I received was a donation in our name to a favorite charity," 
DeDominic said. "The worst was a plastic portfolio-calendar with the giver's 
birthday marked in it." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, DeDominic is giving out crystal Post-it note holders. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy DeLouise, president of Take Aim Productions in Bethesda, Md.: 
</P>
<P>
 "My best gift was getting a pair of silk long johns while I was working on a 
very cold film shoot in the winter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst gift? 
</P>
<P>
 "A pocket-size date book with my name on it." 
</P>
<P>
 DeLouise is giving clients spiced wine from a local winery. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Reich, vice president of Harris Bank, Chicago: 
</P>
<P>
 Her best gift was a music box featuring the characters from "The Wizard of 
Oz." The giver said he thought of her as his personal wizard.  
</P>
<P>
 Her worst gift: a box of jellied fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 What's she giving clients? 
</P>
<P>
 "A personal call to wish them much health, happiness and success in business 
and with their family." 
</P>
<P>
 John Galles, president of National Small Business United, Washington: 
</P>
<P>
 "My best gifts were a pocket computer telephone directory and a sincere 
thank-you for a job well done," Galles said. "My worst was a check for $25."  
</P>
<P>
 What's Galles giving as business gifts this year? 
</P>
<P>
 "Honeybaked hams or turkeys or a book of thoughtful quotations or poems." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillian and Jack Schultz, co-owners of Metronet Protection Services, Chicago: 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of a bad business gift, but I'm sure it was so awful I've 
forgotten about it," said Gillian. Great gifts she's received from employees 
are gimmicky desk accessories and stress-relieving toys. 
</P>
<P>
 What's she giving this year? 
</P>
<P>
 "Motivational tapes with a lasting value." 
</P>
<P>
 Meg Whittemore, columnist for Nation's Business magazine, Washington: 
</P>
<P>
 "The best holiday gift I've received was a voodoo doll in the likeness of my 
editor." 
</P>

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; ONLY 19 MORE DAYS TO GET OUT OF TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood's favorite movie title these days isn't "The Santa Clause" or 
"Interview With the Vampire," despite their box office success. Insiders say 
it's more like "The Great Escape." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives looking to get out from under their oppressive workloads 
are taking longer and more frequent vacations than at any time in recent 
memory, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 One studio is holding its Christmas party two weeks earlier this year than 
last. The reason: Most people planned to get out of town before the traditional 
party period. The deal-making environment has also cooled with the weather. 
People say a lot of business is being deferred till after the first of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deal making goes slack earlier and earlier," said one frustrated 
executive who's still on the job. "And it's not just at Christmas. People have 
discovered Jewish holidays no one ever heard of. Plus there are more long 
weekends. Any postal holiday suddenly turns into a non-week." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood has always taken its leisure time seriously, and people still 
conduct some business during vacations. But the frequency and duration are 
evolving upward. Industry sources say executives are finding more and more 
excuses to get out of the office. They are also committing to longer, more 
isolated and exotic getaways, such as rafting and rock climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer John Davis, who's on the job preparing for the upcoming release of 
"Richie Rich" in theaters and the broadcast of "One Christmas" starring 
Katharine Hepburn on NBC, says "The Great Escape" started on Wall Street and 
spread west, like a lot of business trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those things where everyone assumes everyone else is in a slow 
mode, and it feeds on itself," he said. "It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Thanksgiving-to-New Year's break is the best example. Business used to 
resume on some level between holidays. Now it's often one long stretch of 
inactivity. Late summer has become another Dead Zone. Sometimes distribution 
and marketing executives are the only ones left minding the store, since new 
releases continue through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many people missing, agents often hold back material until the full 
complement of executives is in place. "Agents are loath to lay anything they 
regard as hot material on people who are too low on the chain," one explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant business also slows down, which is another indicator of diminished 
activity. On a recent Friday, one of the most popular Hollywood hangouts was 
only half full for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment attorney David Colden is among those who's noticed the change. 
He agrees that people are punching out earlier. But he also sees other 
explanations for the slowdown. Colden says many companies are dealing with 
depleted budgets and unstable managements. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them are waiting for the beginning of the new fiscal year or for the 
internal musical chairs to end," Colden said. "The fall wasn't that busy, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Another explanation, strangely enough, is that Hollywood is just returning to 
a more rational routine after sustaining the go-go standards of the 1980s for 
too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reflects a sort of sanity," said one executive. "And that's always 
surprising." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Two entertainment companies that aren't on informal hiatus are Harvey 
Entertainment Co. and Dove Audio, which had stock market-related news Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills-based Dove announced an initial public offering of 950,000 
shares of common stock, at $6 per share on the Nasdaq Small Cap Market. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceeds will be used to repay approximately $600,000 in outstanding trade 
indebtedness, "to make certain capital improvements totaling approximately 
$300,000 in the company's warehouse fulfillment capabilities, and for general 
corporate purposes, working capital and potential acquisitions of rights to 
book and film properties," according to Dove. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides audio books, Dove is involved in made-for-TV movies and miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey announced that its common stock has begun trading on Nasdaq's National 
Market System. Chairman Jeffrey A. Montgomery said the change acknowledges 
progress made since Harvey's 1993 initial public offering and increasing 
visibility of comic book characters such as Richie Rich and Casper, which are 
both subjects of upcoming live-action feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica-based Harvey's shares closed Monday at $16.25, down 25 cents. The 
year's high was $19.50; the low was $8.25.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the entertainment world gets symbolically smaller, do people with 
international experience have a larger role to play? That's what Jerry Pam, 
Mike Baumohl and Joel Coler are banking on. The three veteran executives have 
formed Encore International Group to promote and market Hollywood movies, stars 
and events, based on their foreign experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam was half of the well-known public relations agency Guttman & Pam Ltd. 
Baumohl was executive director of international marketing for Warner Bros. And 
Coler was a vice president in advertising and publicity and distribution for 
20th Century Fox's international arm.

 Interactive: Capital Cities/ABC and San Mateo, Calif.-based Electronic Arts 
have formed a joint venture to develop and publish interactive software for 
personal computers and video game machines, company sources said Monday.Each 
company is expected to invest about $10 million in the new venture, dubbed 
ABC/EA Home Software. The deal marries the interactive expertise of Electronic 
Arts -- the largest independent producer of electronic games -- with the 
libraries and programming skills of ABC's news and entertainment production 
arms. Cap Cities/ABC has been looking for a multimedia partner to help it gain 
a foothold in the rapidly growing interactive industry. Electronic Arts, whose 
merger plans with educational software giant Broderbund fell through earlier 
this year, has been searching for a partner to bolster its offerings in 
education and information-based software. Electronic Arts' software lines aimed 
at children, which include a game based on the Sesame Street characters and the 
rights to the popular children's book character Madeleine, will be incorporated 
into the new firm. Greg Bestick, who helped launch the popular CD-ROM version 
of Compton's Encyclopedia, will head the company. Cap Cities/ABC multimedia 
chief Stephen Weiswasser is expected to make the announcement at a news 
conference scheduled for this morning in New York. AMY HARMON

 Television: The new United Paramount Network is said to be near a deal with 
"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" creator Saban Entertainment to provide the new 
network with new children's programming starting next fall. News of the 
alliance circulated at United Paramount's affiliates gathering last week, where 
the network also disclosed that it has added 11 primary affiliates and 11 
secondary affiliates, bringing to 94 the number of markets where the network's 
programs will air.In addition, Paramount parent Viacom Inc. announced that it 
plans to buy Boston television station WSBK for about $100 million in a move 
that will also make it a United Paramount station. United Paramount is a joint 
venture of Chris-Craft Industries and Viacom's Paramount Television Group.

PROPERTY VALUES: A WEEKLY COLUMN BY RON GALPERIN: HOUSE CAN HAVE A LIVED-IN 
LOOK WITHOUT BEING LIVED IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A house just isn't a home without furniture and knickknacks. That's why some 
real estate agents report that selling a vacant house is almost always tougher 
than selling a home that's occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a lived-in look, however, it isn't necessary that a house actually be 
lived in. A few pieces of rented furniture and a few accessories can make a 
house look friendlier and less stark. A temporary caretaker may also help 
create a more lived-in look and improve a seller's chances for a timely sale. 
An empty house suggests to buyers that the owner may be desperate to sell, 
while a home with a few nice accessories is more likely to evoke a warm and 
fuzzy feeling from would-be buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Furnishings sell a home more quickly. It's difficult for buyers to visualize 
living in a vacant home," said Harriet Clune, a regional manager in the 
Woodland Hills branch office of the Jon Douglas Co. "A home shows better 
furnished." 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 20% of Clune's residential listings are vacant at some point before 
they are sold, she said. Many properties are being sold by lenders that 
foreclosed on the previous occupant. Still others, Clune said, are empty 
because the seller got a new job elsewhere or found a bigger, better home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times, people will leave one or two rooms furnished so then when people 
enter the house, their first impression is of a warm, homey look," Clune said. 
She also tries to dress unoccupied homes with a silk ficus tree in the living 
room, a few jars on the kitchen countertops and towels in the bathrooms. Newly 
painted walls are important to cover shadows created by art that has been 
removed from the walls, and clean carpets can help remove the reminder of the 
furniture that is no longer there. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a short-term tenant is another way to increase the appeal of a home 
that would otherwise be empty, Clune advised. She has tried this with one of 
her own homes and recalled having a very positive experience. "The tenant got a 
discounted rental rate and kept the house looking good for six months," she 
recalled. Clune advised owners to thoroughly check out would-be renters before 
allowing them to move in and try to be sure that the renter has nice furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for people to think of an empty house as a home," said Heather 
Simms, branch sales manager for Coldwell Banker Residential in Westlake 
Village. In the winter, an empty house is physically colder and, in the summer, 
the air inside is generally warmer and more stale. Voices echo through an empty 
home and create an eerie feeling, Simms added. 
</P>
<P>
 All these factors detract from the appeal of a residence and the final sales 
price. "When buyers see an empty house, they think of a desperate seller and it 
brings down the price," Simms said. Larger homes are at the biggest 
disadvantage when they are empty, she said, because they appear more hollow and 
because the seller may have to slash the price to get the house sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Savvy sellers may want to consider a number of alternatives to merely listing 
an empty house for sale. Furniture rental companies can fill an empty house in 
relatively short order. The problem with this approach is that most rental 
stores don't also stock accessories and the cost of furnishing several rooms 
can add up quickly -- depending on the size of the rooms and the quality of the 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option is calling a home caretaker company such as America's Home 
Tenders in Glendale. This company finds caretakers with their own furniture for 
empty houses, and the caretakers pay a monthly fee to the company that 
generally totals about one-quarter to one-third of the market-rate rent for the 
home that is being tended. The owners don't get to collect any rent, but they 
don't have to pay for the agency's services. Caretakers pay for utilities, 
gardeners, pool care, homeowner association dues and renter's insurance. The 
agency pays for a $1-million liability policy and the property owner is 
required to keep paying homeowner insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Dias, partner in America's Home Tenders, said he is tending six homes in 
the San Fernando Valley priced between $250,000 and $619,000. The average time 
that his caretakers spend in a house until it is sold is about three to four 
months -- although some homes may stay on the market for up to a year. Dias 
said he avoids calling the caretakers tenants so that they may be required to 
vacate a home within 10 days of being notified by the agency. "We ideally like 
to visit them where they are currently living, or get pictures or video of 
their furniture," Dias said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our caretakers are professionals and, for one reason or another, they 
are in need of temporary housing. We have had fairly few problems recruiting 
caretakers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Denver-based company was founded in 1985 and has been in business in 
Glendale since March, 1993, Dias said. Since then, the company has handled 
about 80 local homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our statistics show that well-maintained homes sell better," Dias said. "An 
empty home immediately screams distressed sale." Besides, he said, "an agent 
selling an empty house doesn't usually have time to air out a house, open the 
windows and lighten it up before showing it to a prospective buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 The caretakers who sign up with Dias' company are required by contract to keep 
the home is top shape for a visit by a real estate agent at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I must admit -- I find it hard to imagine how many professionals with nice 
furniture would agree to pay even a discounted rent for a home that they may 
have to move out of on very short notice. Dias insists that there are plenty of 
takers and that his operation is making money. "If we carry even 20 homes 
generating $500 to $600 a month, it's a profitable business." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Duling, president of Model Interiors in Newbury Park, offers yet another 
option for sellers with an empty home on their hands. Model Interiors basically 
outfits new model homes and a few resale homes with temporary furniture and 
accessories for 25 cents to $1 per square foot. In some cases, Duling has done 
all the design work for free and provided temporary furniture at no cost to the 
homeowner in exchange for being able to use the home as a temporary showroom 
for his clients. This free arrangement is only an option if you have a 
spectacular estate home, Duling said. 
</P>
<P>
 Model Interiors has a 5,000-square-foot warehouse full of furniture and 
accessories to give any house a lived-in look, Duling said. He stocks all 
that's needed for a rag-doll girl's room, a boy's sports room and even a 
polo-inspired room -- complete with boots and a whip. Overall, he said, he has 
decorated about 30 homes for sale in the San Fernando Valley. The final price 
for Duling's services depends on how showy a seller wants to get. He'll even 
fill china cabinets, put place settings at the dining table, hang mirrors on 
the wall and make it look like someone with good taste is living in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Violet Wade, an agent with Coldwell Banker Residential, recalls that Duling 
fully outfitted a 7,000-square-foot home that she had listed in North Ranch. 
The house didn't sell, but Duling did get lots of furniture sold out of the 
temporary showroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wade isn't convinced that empty houses necessarily take longer to sell. 
"If a property is not moving, it's usually because of price," she said, adding 
that what works best isn't more furniture, but a lower price.

QUAYLE REMAINS HOSPITALIZED; BODY IS RESISTING CLOT MEDICINE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Vice President Dan Quayle was ordered Monday to stay in the hospital an 
extra day because his body was resisting medicine to prevent new blood clots in 
his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle was given blood thinners, but a test found that his liver produced 
enough coagulants to counteract the medication, said Dr. Homer Twigg.Twigg, a 
lung specialist, said the dosage was increased, and Quayle could be released 
from the hospital today. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle, 47, was hospitalized a week ago with clots in both lungs. He had been 
scheduled to go home Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Twigg said that "things have gone better than expected" and patients with 
Quayle's ailment usually spend seven to 10 days in the hospital. He said the 
clots would take about six weeks to be dissolved by the body's natural enzymes. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle is able to walk but suffers from shortness of breath, said Dr. Deborah 
Allen, his family physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Twigg said the illness should not affect Quayle's ability to campaign should 
he seek the Republican presidential nomination.

STUDY FINDS DRUGS MAY CURB DAMAGE FROM SPINAL INJURIES; MEDICINE: TESTS BY CITY 
OF HOPE RESEARCHERS USING A COMBINATION OF MEDICATIONS ON RATS YIELD PROMISING 
RESULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rats with spine injuries were able to stand and walk after treatment with a 
combination of drugs, researchers report. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Roberts of the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope in 
Duarte, Calif., said Monday the research shows it may be possible to prevent 
the permanent damage that often occurs in spinal injuries by quickly treating 
patients with drugs that halt damaging inflammation and promote healing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, to be published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences, Roberts and his colleagues caused a compression injury to the 
spinal cords of a group of laboratory rats. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the rats were then treated with one drug, others with two, still 
others with no drugs, and 16 were treated with a combination of three drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 After 21 days, Roberts said, 11 of the 16 rats treated with three drugs were 
able to stand and walk, with four nearly completely recovered. Those rats 
treated with no drugs were not able to walk or stand. Those treated with one or 
two drugs had some recovery, but none could walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said the three drugs appear to suggest a new way of treating spinal 
cord injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 When a mammal has a spinal cord injury, he said, the body tends to aggravate 
the injury with swelling, inflammation and the secretion of some chemicals. 
Some of this response is appropriate, said Roberts, but some of it is damaging. 
</P>
<P>
 "The body has to have defenders following injury, but it is as if the 
defenders get excited and start shooting up those they are defending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To modify the response to spinal injury in the rats, the researchers used 
indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory; bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a drug that 
limits secretion of an immune system protein; and pregnenolone, a type of 
steroid. This combination seemed to moderate the harmful responses, while 
helping the changes that support recovery of the spinal cord.

 SUPER DEAL? County bus service to Leisure World in Laguna Hills stopped last 
summer. So resident Dorothy Novick cooked up an unorthodox deal with 
SuperShuttle of Anaheim, which primarily runs people to airports. SuperShuttle 
has operated a Leisure World supermarket run at a loss for three months, to 
give Novick time to come up with broader financing. She's signing up new riders 
every day. . . . Why is it better than Leisure World's own bus runs? Says 
Novick: "The driver will carry groceries into the house for you."

"affected us kids the way John Kennedy's death affected adults." So Barrett, 
who plays at the no-smoking Sid's nightclub in Newport Beach three nights a 
week, will sing only John Lennon songs Thursday night. . . . Says Barrett: "He 
had a great impact on me. I want everyone to remember him."

 ANY OLD TIME: There's a new approach for doing business with the city of Villa 
Park: Just say you'll do the work -- when you get around to it. . . . Actually, 
it was Councilman John Frackelton's idea -- time options on some routine city 
bids. It lets a contractor do the work any time within a year, whenever it's 
most convenient to that company. Says Frackelton: "Sometimes you can get a 
better price that way." . . . It worked on the first bid, saving the city about 
$5,000.

MARRIAGE BETWEEN 2 COURT SYSTEMS DISSOLVED; LAW: A DECISION BY THE VENTURA 
COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT TO STOP ASSIGNING CASES TO LOWER-COURT JURISTS ENDS 
EXPERIMENT. JUDGES SAY THE VOTE HAS CREATED ILL WILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After a trial marriage, the Superior Court has decided to separate from the 
Municipal Court -- possibly ending a ballyhooed experiment to bring Ventura 
County a single, more efficient system of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have filed for divorce," a disappointed John R. Smiley, presiding judge 
of the Municipal Court, said Monday of the unilateral decision to stop 
assigning cases to lower-courts jurists next year. 
</P>
<P>
 That could mean that civil and criminal cases before the higher court would 
take much longer to get to trial, officials said. And judges on both courts 
said privately that the vote last week has already created ill will. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, two of the county's 12 Municipal Court judges are assigned full time to 
the overloaded Superior Court.  
</P>
<P>
 But because of the Superior Court decision, Smiley said the plan under which 
municipal judges serve long stints on the superior bench would be dumped after 
the current agreement expires July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court judges said they are hopeful that the entire consolidation will 
not have to be scrapped. But no alternative has yet been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because an initiative to consolidate courts across California failed to make 
the November ballot, some Superior Court judges said they felt it was no longer 
appropriate to unify the two courts locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that a lot of judges thought it was illegal in the 
beginning," said Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr., chief of the 
felony division. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smiley said some Municipal Court judges thought their Superior Court 
colleagues had other motives for going their separate way.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the message we're getting from the Superior Court is, 'We want you to 
take your judges back. We don't need your help,' " Smiley said. "We are very 
sad to see them take the position that they have. We think that is a tremendous 
disservice to the people of this county." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Melinda A. Johnson, Superior Court presiding judge, said that 11 of the 
court's 14 members supported the separation. The vote follows a similar move 
recently by judges on the Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said some of Ventura County's higher court judges felt the municipal 
jurists were starting to have too much influence over Superior Court decisions 
-- partly because of the increased authority of a four-judge committee that has 
overseen the court consolidation experiment. Two of those judges are from the 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a concern by some judges that our decision-making was controlled by 
the Municipal Court," said Johnson, a prime backer of consolidation and one of 
the three judges who voted to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's vote has produced one important change already, dissolution of the 
four-judge consolidation committee. 
</P>
<P>
 After the courts agreed to consolidate in September, 1993, the judges set up 
the committee to make recommendations on issues affecting the unified court. 
The committee consisted of the two presiding judges, plus one additional jurist 
from each of the two benches. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the manner in which that panel made decisions independent from the other 
judges that concerned some of the members of the Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said she worries that the Superior Court's civil calendar could 
unravel if judges do not approve a revamped agreement for long-term 
cross-assignments. Under authority of the state Supreme Court, the presiding 
judge has the ability to temporarily assign municipal judges to the Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 But to do that on a long-term basis, the presiding judges need the blessings 
of the rest of their colleagues. She held out hope that the judges on both 
courts could somehow agree to continue the cross-assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have more work per person than the Municipal Court," Johnson said of the 
Superior Court. "They help us." 
</P>
<P>
 But Smiley said if the Superior Court no longer wants that help, then the 
Municipal Court will not volunteer it. He said many Municipal Court judges, at 
a meeting last week, were saddened to learn that the Superior Court had voted 
to part ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their feeling is, 'Hey, if you don't want our help on any basis, we can't 
force you to take our help,' " Smiley said. "'We will be able to better manage 
our caseload." 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley also said the Superior Court judges should not be so stuck on 
distinguishing between the two courts. The Superior Court handles all criminal 
felonies and civil matters in excess of $25,000. The Municipal Court handles 
all other criminal, civil and traffic matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in the business of being a, quote, Municipal Court Judge," Smiley 
said. "I'm in the business of helping to provide the people of Ventura County a 
place to get their disputes resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the most vocal Superior Court judges against the consolidation 
either did not return calls Monday or could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 But Campbell said he does not see the vote as a slap in the face of the 
lower-court judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel it was a message to the Municipal Court that 'we don't want your 
help,' " Campbell said.

PLAN OFFERED TO GET HOMELESS OFF THE STREET, BACK TO WORK; EMPLOYMENT: 
PRESIDENT OF SUCCESSFUL SAN DIEGO ALPHA PROJECT TELLS AREA MERCHANTS THEY CAN 
END VAGRANCY AT A MINIMUM COST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A San Diego man who says homelessness can be ended by putting transients to 
work espoused his work ethic in speeches around Ventura on Monday, impressing 
business people with the promise of wiping out vagrancy at a minimum cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country was not built by freeloaders -- it was built by hard workers," 
said Bob McElroy, president of San Diego's Alpha Project for the Homeless. "We 
can't help people who don't want to help themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 McElroy came to town at the invitation of Rosa Lee Measures, a Ventura council 
member on a crusade to rid downtown of panhandlers and vagrants. In the first 
day of a two-day visit, he spoke at both a breakfast and a luncheon gathering, 
held a press conference at City Hall and toured the Ventura River bottom, where 
approximately 200 homeless people have encampments. 
</P>
<P>
 A former teacher, McElroy describes his program with the zeal of an 
evangelical preacher bent on making new converts. He told an intent Ventura 
audience Monday of how, nine years ago, he lived for weeks among the homeless 
in an effort to understand them. He emerged, he said, with the conviction that 
most social-service programs perpetuate vagrancy by offering people something 
for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're enabling, folks," he said. "I went and lived in the parks, lived in the 
missions and realized there was a tremendous system set up" to support 
homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 His Alpha Project has won attention across Southern California for its success 
in getting homeless people off the city streets by employing them in 
entry-level jobs. In a time when government is strapped for funds, and welfare 
is a dirty word in some circles, McElroy boasts of a program run largely 
through contracted jobs and private grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of San Diego contracts with him to run its social-services day 
center, and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan is talking with Alpha Project 
officials about opening a similar facility downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy offered no concrete figures Monday and was vague on the specifics of 
starting a local program. He speculated, though, that if the city and the 
merchants could identify some project, such as sweeping city streets for low 
wages, and put together the money to fund it, he could help organize a work 
force of homeless people within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His words were music to the merchants' ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very impressed," said Ed Warren, owner of two downtown restaurants, who 
heard McElroy's speech over breakfast. "I think we need to make some kind of 
contributions to these people so they see that the responsible way to live is 
to work for a living." 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy's services, of course, do not come for free. But Measures says she 
hopes to persuade her colleagues to agree to a contract with him until Ventura 
starts running its own program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exciting because this is really giving people who have fallen on 
unfortunate times dignity and independence," she said. "It's breaking a cycle 
that is hard to break."  
</P>
<P>
 Measures added that she does not know how much it would cost the city to 
implement McElroy's program, but believes that it would be a "nominal amount." 
She said the council's housing committee, which she chairs, will discuss 
funding the program when it meets today. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee members -- Measures and Councilmen Jim Monahan and Jack 
Tingstrom -- organized a task force earlier in the year to study the 
feasibility of constructing a homeless campground in Ventura. But they 
concluded that the city cannot afford to pay for such a facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they have endorsed a series of proposed ordinances that would cut 
down on panhandling downtown. They were enthusiastic for a while about a police 
proposal to kick people out of the river bottom through a three-step 
enforcement plan. But they backed away from the idea after other council 
members said they could not support a proposal that might violate the civil 
rights of the river dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to McElroy, though, Ventura's homeless problem is minor -- compared, 
at least, to the troubles he has seen in Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have a problem in Ventura here, folks," he said. "You have a 
blight. You are in a unique position to deal with a solvable situation."

COUNTY IS SAFEST URBAN AREA IN THE WEST; STATISTICS: A DRAMATIC DECLINE IN 
OXNARD CRIME RATE PROPELS REGION BACK TO THE TOP. AUTHORITIES CREDIT CITIZEN 
INVOLVEMENT.

<P>
 Ventura County reclaimed its title as the safest urban area in the West in 
1993 after nearly a 10% drop in serious crime, according to figures released 
Monday by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's relatively low crime rate was pushed down by a dramatic drop in 
crime in Oxnard -- the county's largest and most crime-ridden city -- and by 
Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks posting statistics as two of the safest cities of 
their size in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 For the previous two years, Provo, Utah, had displaced the county as the 
safest urban area among the 13 western states. Crime fell in Provo in 1993, but 
not as fast as it did in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County reported 38.8 crimes per 1,000 residents, a 9.7% drop from the 
1992 rate of 43 crimes per 1,000 people, according to the FBI's long-delayed 
Uniform Crime Reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Provo posted a rate of 40.7 crimes per 1,000 residents, falling behind the 
county and other safe western metropolitan areas of Fort Collins, Colo., San 
Luis Obispo County, and Bremerton, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very successful last year," said Oxnard Police Chief Harold L. Hurtt, 
pointing out his city's 13.7% drop in crime.  
</P>
<P>
 He attributed the crime reduction to the $1 million added to the city's police 
budget, the enforced ban on cruising on Oxnard Boulevard, new storefront 
stations in crime-troubled areas and citizens organizing their own neighborhood 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were frustrated with the crime problem and they have taken an active 
part in our prevention efforts," Hurtt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's rate of serious crime -- violence such as rape, robbery and 
murder, along with burglaries and theft -- was more than one-third lower than 
California's and more than one-fourth below the nationwide norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's crime rate was also far lower than that of any large Southern 
California county, roughly 45% lower than the rate in Los Angeles and 18% lower 
than that in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I live here," said Ventura County Undersheriff Richard S. Bryce. 
The Sheriff's Department handles police matters for five of the county's 10 
cities and all of the unincorporated areas in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryce said Ventura County has been able to maintain a reputation as a strong 
law-and-order community, particularly with some would-be criminals. "I think 
that has helped more crime from infiltrating from Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that law enforcement agencies work well with each other and with 
members of the public to deter crime and capture criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as I'd like to take credit, it still comes back to the kind of people 
we have as neighbors," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Police Chief Willard R. Schlieter, who joined the Simi Valley 
department earlier this year, said he too has noticed an exceptional 
willingness by residents to get involved. And that has helped his officers 
control crime spilling over the Los Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cities, people hear gunshots and smashing of glass and they won't 
bother calling the cops," Schlieter said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simi Valley residents are very attentive and helpful, he said. "We wind up 
arresting people in stolen vehicles as they are trying to leave our city. We 
get the information that fast." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI reported Ventura County's violent crimes of murder, rape and assault 
dropped from 3,799 in 1992 to 3,471 in 1993, a decline of 8.6%. Property crimes 
of burglary, theft and car theft fell from 26,045 in 1992 to 23,466 in 1993, a 
9.9% decline. 
</P>

 Nationwide, Ventura County is less of a standout when it comes to comparing 
low crime rates in the Northeast, Midwest and South. The county ranked 48th out 
of the nation's 272 Metropolitan Statistical Areas measured in the 1993 
Unformed Crime Reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI annual crime report defines Metropolitan Statistical Areas as an 
urbanized area that has a central city or a cluster of communities with 
economic and social ties and at least 50,000 people. Nearly 80% of the U.S. 
population is located in these statistical areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnstown, a two-county community of 241,800 people in western Pennsylvania, 
kept its title as the safest metropolitan area in the country with a mere 15.6 
crimes per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the scale, Miami and surrounding Dade County in Florida 
held onto the dubious distinction as having the highest rate, 135 crimes per 
1,000 people. Urban Crime in 1993

COLLEAGUES AND STUDENTS BID LAKIN FAREWELL AT MEMORIAL; TRAGEDY: THE EDUCATOR, 
WHO SUCCUMBED TO 'FLESH- EATING BACTERIA,' IS EULOGIZED FOR HIS WORK AS WELL AS 
HIS HONESTY AND GOOD HUMOR.

<P>
 Two days after the Hollywood Hills funeral of Thomas G. Lakin, a memorial 
service was held Monday in Ventura to give students and faculty a final chance 
to say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 Eulogies and remembrances marked the morning as friends and colleagues of the 
Ventura County Community College District chancellor recounted Lakin's drive 
for success and passion for knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin died Nov. 27 from necrotizing fasciitis, commonly called "flesh-eating 
bacteria," after a frantic, 24-hour battle to save his life at Los Robles 
Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Lakin's family and friends sought to highlight contributions the 
chancellor made to education and his community over his 50 years, as well as 
his sense of humor and respect for his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (memorial) will not be one of mourning," said college board President 
Allan W. Jacobs. "But rather, a celebration of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 A rose garden will be planted in Lakin's honor outside the district office on 
Day Road in Ventura, where the service was held Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 State Chancellor David Mertes told mourners he brought with him the sympathies 
of California's 107 community colleges, "the support of students, faculty and 
staff, thousands of people who knew and respected Tom." 
</P>
<P>
 Mertes described the occasion of his first meeting with Lakin, a walking tour 
of Southwest College in Los Angeles, where Lakin was brought in as president in 
1986 to increase enrollment and revitalize the inner-city campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was an individual who just exuded pride in that institution," Mertes 
said. "He was very honest, very realistic. He knew the importance of that 
college in the middle of Watts." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College President Elise D. Schneider opened her eulogy with an old 
African proverb she said epitomizes the chancellor's giving spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he leaves something behind that people will benefit from, then his life is 
eternal," Schneider said, her voice cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 The educator credited Lakin with upgrading the libraries at the district's 
three campuses, improving the registration process, the police force and other 
services in his 3 1/2 years with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Can't' was omitted from his vocabulary," Schneider said. "It was always, 
'We can do it. We'll figure out how.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider also shared with the audience a note Lakin had written to her last 
March, when he celebrated his 50th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mourn not for me," the chancellor wrote jokingly. "I have colleagues who know 
how to celebrate. . . . Fifty is actually quite nifty." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Robinson, the Ventura College math instructor who represented the 
district's teachers at the memorial, remembered Lakin as a gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times when it was my job to disagree with the positions of Dr. 
Lakin," Robinson said. "(But) in either situation, we could discuss our 
positions calmly and with respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have heard him admit to error," Robinson added. "But under no circumstances 
would he accept that any of his motives were less than honorable." 
</P>
<P>
 Student Trustee Chi Young Choe, who sits on the governing board but has no 
official vote, said Lakin had helped her tremendously in taking on the 
responsibilities of representing 28,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of cases where we disagreed, but he was always the first one 
to take the blame or the accolades," Choe said. "We're going to miss him, his 
open door and most of all we're going to miss his smiles." 
</P>
<P>
 She also thanked the chancellor for helping her gain the maturity needed to 
not take personally the setbacks that come with being a student trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, there were times when I was not that mature," Choe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lakin's widow, Karen, and his four daughters attended the service 
Monday, only his two older daughters spoke. Lori Lakin, 25, seemed surprised at 
the sizable turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really had no idea Dad was so famous," she said. "To us, he was just Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She added that although Lakin was a busy man professionally, he always had 
time for his family. "He would answer his private line 'chancellor's office,' 
as if he was in someone else's office," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't a very religious man, but he was a minister of education," Lori 
Lakin added. "To Dad, there was no such thing as a lost soul, only young people 
who hadn't found their way yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori's older sister, Lesa, thanked those who attended the service and implored 
them not to be too sorrowful about Lakin's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd want us all laughing and smiling," she said. "So just remember that."

 These three nurses have dedicated time and research to improve pain control in 
children. While working in the pediatric department at Fountain Valley Regional 
Hospital and Medical Center, they developed a simple scale used to measure pain 
in children. "It's taken the nurse's gut feeling about a patient and it's put 
it into a uniform, consistent method that allows you to make a decision whether 
it's irritability or pain," said Anoina-Box, clinical manager for the pediatric 
unit and pediatric intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
 Their pain scale and guidelines have been adopted for use at the hospital. Now 
they hope to get their research published in a nursing journal.

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE ; YOUTH CENTER HELPING KIDS FOR THE 
FUTURE

 One of the sad things about children who grow up in group homes -- placed 
there because of lives filled with abuse and neglect -- is that many do not 
make it when they grow up, said Meg Sciscento, a recreational therapist with 
Children Are Our Future, a small and relatively new collection of group homes 
in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've been able to do something about it," said 
Sciscento, speaking of a new Youth Enrichment Center opened up in back of one 
of the group's nine homes about a month ago. The new center's emancipation 
classes are designed to teach life skills and build confidence in the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the classes, group-home residents, can learn basic skills such as how 
to order gas, electricity and telephone service when they become adults. 
Volunteers are needed to help with other skills, including teaching the 
children how to fill in a job application, prepare for an interview, shop, plan 
a menu and cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a horrendous amount of children that have ended up back into the 
system after they turned 18 because they didn't have the skills," said 
Sciscento, who added that many end up in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Children Are Our Future has also been able to offer new programs, such as 
drama, in the new enrichment center. The drama program has drawn nearly half of 
the approximately 50 youths in the group homes. One teen-ager was such a 
natural actor that he was able to get into an acting workshop in Beverly Hills, 
Sciscento said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the organization is looking for more volunteers to work with the 
drama program, as well as someone to teach music, art and crafts and other 
talents. Also needed are volunteers willing to come in to talk about their jobs 
and what kind of work is available. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, volunteer tutors are needed to help students as young as 7 with 
their homework. In one of the group homes, a high school chemistry tutor 
especially is needed, said Sciscento. 
</P>
<P>
 Sciscento started as a volunteer three years ago and is now an employee 
overseeing weekend activities such as field trips to Knott's Berry Farm, sports 
programs and helping to feed the homeless in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Children Are Our Future also needs donations of books, help for a holiday 
party scheduled Dec. 13 and gift-wrapping help on Saturday. To volunteer or for 
more information call (818) 709-3808 or (818) 773-8136. 
</P>
<P>
 A support/therapy group for women in transition is forming at the Family 
Service Agency of Burbank. All women are invited to join the group and to learn 
strategies to increase coping skills to lead more full and happy lives. 
Meetings will be held in the evenings. For more information call (818) 
845-7671. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed for the Senior Connections Program of the Family Service 
Agency of Burbank. Volunteers are trained and supervised by a licensed 
therapist to help seniors with aging issues, bereavement in individual or group 
counseling and other problems. The agency also provides home visitation. For 
training information call Nell at (818) 845-7671. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers and donations are needed by the Hospice of the Hospital Home Health 
Care Agency. Hospice volunteers give three to four hours a week helping the 
family of a terminally ill patient. For more information, call Lisa Nagy, 
volunteer director at (818) 785-1800. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood-based Activities for Retarded Children needs volunteers to 
make occasional repairs on two houses, to read to children and help with 
painting. The group has volunteer counselors, a Saturday recreation program and 
an English hand bell choir. For more information, call Dixie or Mary at (818) 
762-4365. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Involved is a weekly listing of volunteering opportunities. Please 
address prospective listings to Getting Involved, Los Angeles Times, 20000

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DONATIONS EXTEND HOURS AT LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Private donations totaling $7,677 will keep several Ventura library branches 
open longer next year, but county library officials are still seeking a 
contribution from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said donations generated through a recent library survey will 
add a total of five hours to three county library branches from Jan. 7 to June 
25. 
</P>
<P>
 The H.P. Wright Library on Day Road in Ventura garnered the most donations, 
receiving $3,049 from survey respondents. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will allow it to remain open an additional two hours on Wednesday 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Ventura's E.P. Foster Library received $1,078, which means it can 
open two hours earlier on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Avenue Library on Ventura Avenue, which now opens at 2 p.m. Mondays, will 
open an hour earlier. The new hours will be from 1 to 6 p.m. Mondays. The 
branch received $328 in donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saticoy branch received $200, but county officials will delay adding 
additional hours until a new facility opens in Saticoy next summer.  
</P>
<P>
 Alan Langville, community library division manager, welcomed the contributions 
but said the county has lost millions of dollars in permanent funding in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small step and certainly a welcome one, but it is certainly a drop in 
the budget in the amount that we've lost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Langville said library officials will discuss additional funding with the city 
of Ventura's budget committee at 4 p.m. Wednesday at City Hall. Langville said 
the city of Ojai has already agreed to give $30,000 to increase the hours there 
from 24 to 40 hours a week. JAN STEVENS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; EXECUTIVE SENTENCED TO 45 DAYS IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trash-company executive was sentenced Monday to 45 days in jail and ordered 
to perform 360 hours of community service in connection with a drunk-driving 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Thomas J. Hutchins also placed Myron George Harrison of 
Camarillo on five years probation, suspended his license for a year and fined 
the 53-year-old defendant $2,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, chief financial officer of E.J. Harrison and Sons rubbish-collection 
firm, was convicted in October of 13 misdemeanors stemming from a March 26 
drunk-driving wreck that left two people slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses testified that Harrison left Santa Paula about 7:40 p.m. and sped 
down California 126. While on the highway, he knocked two cars off the road, 
then made a U-turn through oleander bushes in the center divider and struck two 
more cars, said Deputy Dist. Atty. David Lehr. Police arrested him in downtown 
Ventura, where he sideswiped four more cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Louis B. (Chuck) Samonsky argued that his client did not 
remember what happened because he was experiencing a hypoglycemic blackout that 
was aggravated by a hypothyroid condition and a 25-year-old bout with 
encephalitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison refused to comment after Monday's court hearing, but Samonsky said: 
"Mr. Harrison had something triggered by alcohol ingestion and rightfully has 
taken it upon himself to stop drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Samonsky called the incident "completely out of character" for the defendant. 
</P>

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CAMPFIRE BAN LIFTED IN NATIONAL FOREST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Restrictions on campfires in Los Padres National Forest have been lifted 
because of cooler weather and the beginning of the rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood-burning campfires will now be allowed outside of developed campgrounds 
for those carrying permits. Permits may be obtained at the Ojai Ranger Station, 
1190 E. Ojai Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire restrictions are imposed each summer to reduce the chance of 
wildfires, then lifted each fall when the weather increases the moisture level 
in vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 The forest service also will allow residents living inside Los Padres National 
Forest to burn their yard debris. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN, 21, ARRESTED IN PHONE 'CLONE' CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard police have arrested a 21-year-old man on suspicion of arranging to 
have cellular phones "cloned" so calls could be billed to other customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kip Cyrus Sweeney allegedly offered customers at Crossover Cellular in Oxnard 
the option of having their phones activated legitimately or reprogrammed with 
someone else's electronic serial number, said Oxnard Police Detective Len 
Newcomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney was taken into custody about 5 p.m. Thursday after agreeing to 
illegally clone a cellular phone for two Secret Service agents working 
undercover, Newcomb said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was pretty blatant about that," Newcomb said. "He just said to our 
operators, 'You want it set up legitimately or do you want me to have it 
chipped for you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 As payment for the cloning, Sweeney agreed to accept three pagers that the 
agents told him were stolen, Newcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney's arrest was the second in two weeks in the county in connection with 
cellular phone fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 29, sheriff's detectives raided the homes of two accused drug dealers. 
Along with methamphetamine and guns, they seized equipment used for 
reprogramming cellular-phone chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney, who lives in Oxnard, was booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion 
of attempting to receive stolen property and phone fraud, both felonies. He was 
released Friday on a promise to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomb said the actual reprogramming appears to have been done by another 
Ventura County resident, but he would not say if further arrests are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Sweeney's arrest, police seized one cloned phone in the small 
office in the Union Bank Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Police do not yet know how many phones Sweeney arranged to have modified or 
the amount of calls placed illegally. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 Ventura officially hired a new city manager Monday -- a 46-year-old, Santa 
Paula native who now runs a northern Californian county. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Landeros will start her job in Ventura on Jan. 17, four days after 
leaving her post in Yolo County.Landeros will make $105,000 in her first year 
on the job. She now receives $86,000 as chief administrator in Yolo, a county 
of 150,000 people that is adjacent to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved Landeros' contract, then agreed to have 
Ventura Police Chief Richard Thomas serve as interim city manager until 
Landeros comes on board. 
</P>
<P>
 The position became vacant in July, when then-manager John Baker left after 12 
years to start his own consulting firm. He was replaced temporarily by the 
retired top administrator of Santa Barbara, also named Richard Thomas, whose 
contract expired Dec. 1. CONSTANCE SOMMER

MAYOR APPOINTED OVER OBJECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise move that came over the objections of two colleagues, longtime 
City Councilman Alfonso C. Urias was appointed Santa Paula's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, with two new members meeting for the first time, selected Urias 
on Monday night in a 3-2 vote, disappointing Mayor Pro Tem Robin 
Sullivan.Sullivan said tradition backed her for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the city's last 12 mayors served as mayor pro tem immediately before 
their appointments. The city's mayor serves a one-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, former Mayor John A. F. Melton bid for the seat. When 
controversy arose, he nominated his ally, Urias, instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the sudden he said, 'Why don't you be mayor?' " Urias said, recalling 
a conversation over the weekend. In turn, Urias nominated Melton as mayor pro 
tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Urias unsuccessfully nominated Melton last year before Councilman Wayne D. 
Johnson was appointed in a 3-2 vote. Johnson had served as mayor pro tem the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson lost his bid for reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Urias, 70, was first elected to the council in 1974. He has served all but two 
years since then. Melton, 64, reelected in November to his sixth consecutive 
four-year term, served as mayor in 1986-87 and 1991. He's a retired Southern 
California Edison manager. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Arnold Dowdy administered the oath of office to Melton, 
Espinosa and newspaper publisher Don Johnson shortly before the mayor was 
selected. PAUL ELIAS

CITY COUNCIL OKS FUNDS FOR QUAKE SOIL SAMPLING; SIMI VALLEY: RESIDENTS HAD 
REQUESTED FURTHER STUDY OF POST-TEMBLOR GROUND SHIFTING. CITY EXPECTS FEDERAL 
MONEY TO COVER COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of an ongoing effort to pinpoint ground shifting that occurred because 
of the Northridge earthquake, the Simi Valley City Council on Monday agreed to 
fund a study to help prevent future mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will pay Ventura-based consultant Fugro West as much as $132,000 
to bore deep into the soil in parts of Simi Valley that were hit hard by the 
quake.The city expects the cost of the study to be covered by federal quake 
relief funds. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary study conducted earlier this year showed that the ground was 
largely stable but still subject to some settling, prompting residents to ask 
the city to examine the problem further. Without more detailed information, 
some homeowners fear they cannot settle insurance claims or begin rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 In its investigation, Fugro West will collect and scrutinize soil samples from 
as deep as 50 feet, said City Engineer George Berg. The consultant will then 
offer homeowners tips on what they can do to shore up against future damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial report was primarily a surface analysis," Berg said. "Now we're 
going below ground to take a look at these movements and come up with some 
findings. It's more scientific." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton said the study would help residents looking to rebuild 
their homes and city workers concerned about laying pipes and electrical lines 
along quake-cracked streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be good for the neighbors and good for us," Stratton said. 
"Obviously, we need to know what's going on below ground before we start 
putting things down there."

SIMI VALLEY FREEWAY RENAMED AFTER REAGAN; TRANSPORTATION: STATE SENATE VOTES 38 
TO 0 TO HONOR THE EX-PRESIDENT. CALTRANS WILL INSTALL SIGNS ONCE THE ESTIMATED 
$4,000 COST IS RAISED PRIVATELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With fond words for the nation's 40th President, the state Senate on Monday 
overwhelmingly approved designating the Simi Valley Freeway as the Ronald 
Reagan Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day of the 1995-96 legislative session, the Senate voted 38 to 0 
to re-christen the entire length of the freeway in honor of the two-term 
President from California. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Transportation will begin installing signs at each end 
of the freeway as soon as money is raised from private sources; the state does 
not pay to rename freeways after private individuals. The estimated cost is 
$4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), a co-author of the resolution along 
with state Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), urged colleagues 
to approve it in part because the freeway leads to the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's only appropriate that with the Reagan library in the area, right 
at the end of the 118 freeway, it would be named for Ronald Reagan," Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A more impassioned plea came from state Sen. Henry J. Mello (D-Watsonville), 
who praised the 83-year-old Reagan for displaying "great courage" in recently 
disclosing publicly that he suffers from Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Reagan freeway designation is really appropriate," Mello said. "But more 
important is to give recognition because he had the courage not to hide his 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Mello said Reagan's candid statements in an open letter addressed to "my 
fellow Americans" will help remove the stigma for other memory-loss sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Smith, director of the presidential library, said the freeway 
designation is a fitting honor for Reagan, who inspires many library visitors 
with "the sense that the Reagan years were the last golden age in the Golden 
State." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of his great attributes was to foster a sense of hope," said Smith, 
interpreting the Legislature's designation as proof that public nostalgia for 
the Republican President is more than just a passing fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the Assembly passed a similar resolution by Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco) and backed by a lengthy bipartisan list of co-authors.

3 TEMPLES JOIN FORCES TO CAPTURE HOLIDAY SPIRIT; THOUSAND OAKS: AREA COUPLE IS 
GALVANIZING THE COMMUNITY TO ORGANIZE A CHRISTMAS DAY DINNER FOR THE NEEDY AND 
LONELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the noise and the exhaust of a traffic jam last month, Donn and Joyce 
Delson caught the holiday spirit like never before. 
</P>
<P>
 How about marshaling the resources of the three Jewish congregations in the 
Conejo Valley to put on a free Christmas Day dinner in Thousand Oaks for 2,500 
or more people who are needy or simply lonely? 
</P>
<P>
 The idea burst to life like a fireplace on a winter's eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Thousands Oaks area -- at temples and churches, businesses and 
schools -- the genius and the generosity of the Delsons have kindled a spirit 
of brotherhood that has bound Christian and Jew, young and old, in a campaign 
to give. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's kind of our catch-phrase," said Joyce Delson, 46, a member of Temple 
Adat Elohim in Thousand Oaks, "because so many . . . have so much, in terms of 
family relationships, religion, financial security and safe environments. We 
want to give something back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Community Holiday Dinner, the first of its kind in Thousand Oaks, 
is expected to be held from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Dec. 25 in the cafeteria at 
Thousand Oaks High School, space donated by the Conejo Valley Unified School 
District. Delson said all who seek comfort and camaraderie are invited. 
</P>
<P>
 Three temples -- Adat Elohim and Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks and Beth Haverim 
in Agoura Hills -- will coordinate the event, with the Delsons' leadership, and 
expect to provide the bulk of the volunteers who will serve and cook the food. 
The Delsons met at their Agoura Hills home with representatives of the temples 
Monday night to coordinate the massive dinner, which they speculate could draw 
as many as 3,000 people or as few as 300. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since this is predominantly a Christian holiday, we thought it would be 
wonderful if the Jewish community would come together and participate," said 
Donn Delson, 46, a member of Temple Adat Elohim since 1979, and president of a 
Westlake Village manufacturing and marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Alan Greenbaum, whose temple incurred more than $25,000 in damages from 
an arson fire in 1991, said this is one way the 400 families in the 
congregation can repay the Christian community for its outpouring of support in 
rebuilding a section of the burned temple roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a saying that comes from the Talmud, 'Do not remove yourself from the 
community,' " Greenbaum said, "which is to say we see ourselves as an active 
part of the Jewish and Christian community." 
</P>
<P>
 Delson, who volunteered at a soup kitchen for the homeless in Los Angeles a 
couple of years ago, said, "The most amazing thing to me is how absolutely 
enthusiastic and how excited people are to participate in this. . . . I believe 
that this is a wonderful way to build community esprit de corps." 
</P>
<P>
 Student volunteers from the three area high schools, kindergartners, school 
district personnel, members of local churches, the Chamber of Commerce, the 
city of Thousand Oaks and Jewish youth groups all are expected to help, Joyce 
Delson said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said donations may be mailed to the Conejo Community Holiday Dinner, c/o 
Los Robles Bank, 33 W. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks, 91360.  
</P>
<P>
 "We might have to limit the number who are helping us, which sounds like a 
wonderful problem," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, one of the greatest joys of giving is how good it makes you 
feel," said Donn Delson, who hatched the Christmas dinner idea while lunching 
with his mother, Lora Delson, near San Francisco the week before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning that the restaurateur serves free Thanksgiving meals to about 
1,000 needy people each year, Delson mulled over the idea and then shared it 
with his wife while they were en route to an inn in Sonoma County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were stuck in traffic so we had a few hours to talk, and then we got 
excited," said Joyce Delson, a librarian at Westlake High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, amid the redwoods and over dinner, the idea jelled and an enthusiastic 
Donn Delson later brought up his plan to Richard W. Simpson, assistant 
superintendent of the Conejo Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district not only offered the high school cafeteria, but also set 
up a plan whereby employees can donate part of their paychecks to cover the 
utility costs for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that any time we reach out to the less fortunate in the community, 
that's great," Simpson said.

THOUSAND OAKS TEEN-AGER GETS 3 YEARS IN GIRL'S SLAYING; SENTENCING: JUDGE GIVES 
YOUTH 10 1/2 YEARS, BUT SINCE HE WAS TRIED AS A JUVENILE AND CONVICTED OF 
INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, HE WILL SERVE LESS TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Thousand Oaks teen-ager who shot his girlfriend to death while playing with 
a loaded gun was sentenced to 10 1/2 years in the California Youth Authority by 
a Superior Court judge Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the boy, who turned 18 last month, was tried as a juvenile and 
convicted of involuntary manslaughter -- rather than murder -- state law 
requires him to serve only until he turns 21, or three years in the juvenile 
detention system, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing Monday, Ingrid Reay French, clutching a photograph of her 
16-year-old daughter, Jacqueline Reay, told reporters that the boy who killed 
her daughter had not been justly punished. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm not satisfied with the judgment," French said. "But as I've said all 
along, he will be judged by a higher judge. And he will have to live the rest 
of his life knowing that he killed my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 The convicted teen-ager showed no emotion as Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. 
handed down his sentence after an emotional 2 1/2-hour hearing in which family 
members of both the defendant and the victim testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's mother, a former schoolteacher, a clinical psychologist and the 
teen-ager himself appealed to the judge to send him for one year to a remote 
treatment center in Utah rather than to turn him over to the custody of the 
California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Harold L. Burke told the court that the youth would be closely 
supervised at the Utah center, where he would receive proper care for an 
attention-deficit disorder that contributed to his aggressive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke also said the boy, who is 6 feet, 4 inches tall and weighs 240 pounds, 
"needs to burn off some testosterone" and that the treatment center could help 
him do so by providing him with such beneficial physical exercises as canoeing, 
skiing and horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn dismissed those arguments, saying that 
to enroll the defendant in a "residential program in Utah where he can go 
skiing and canoeing for one year would be a gross injustice." 
</P>
<P>
 During her testimony Monday, French said that too much consideration was being 
given to the assailant, rather than to her daughter, the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wondering what can be done for Jacqueline, who will never have a chance 
to grow up, to graduate and fulfill her dream as a marine biologist," said a 
tearful French, who moved from Newbury Park to Nevada in October after the 
trial. "We can never bring her back." 
</P>
<P>
 India Reay, Jacqueline's 24-year-old sister, read a letter from her sister's 
best friend, Sharleen Hess, who was too emotional to testify. Hess wrote that 
she thought Jacqueline's assailant should get the maximum sentence available. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Campbell agreed, noting that the youth had already spent several years 
in private treatment centers but that his aggressive behavior had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been given chances, and he hasn't taken advantage of them," Campbell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell recounted how the youth had repeatedly pointed a 9-millimeter, 
semiautomatic handgun at the victim and others all afternoon July 13, before 
fatally shooting Jacqueline once in the eye in the kitchen of her Newbury Park 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced he knew that pointing the gun at people was dangerous and that 
was the whole reason he did it," Campbell said. "He was waving the gun around, 
and threatening people just to entertain himself. He should have known it was 
going to go off."

CLIPPER COUNTDOWN TO RECORD FUTILITY AT 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Bill Fitch maintains that the Clippers, the NBA's only winless team, are 
being tested. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's the case, the Clippers have failed 16 times in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are one loss from matching the league record for consecutive 
defeats at the start of a season, falling behind by 25 points at the end of the 
third quarter and losing to the Charlotte Hornets, 115-83, Monday night before 
an announced crowd of 7,492 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who play the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night at the Sports 
Arena, have lost their first 16 games, one shy of the NBA record set by the 
expansion Miami Heat in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we won the next 66 games we'd be in good shape," Clipper forward Malik 
Sealy quipped. "Everybody would forget all about this 0-16 start." 
</P>
<P>
 Things are going so badly for the Clippers, who set a franchise record by 
losing their 20th consecutive game, dating back to last season, that they can't 
even give away team T-shirts. Clipper cheerleaders threw T-shirts into the 
stands before the start of the fourth quarter and fans threw them back onto the 
court in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't dwell on it (the losing streak)," Fitch said. "Once in a while you 
make a joke about it. You've got to be able to laugh at yourself in situations 
that hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think we're a laughing stock. You've got to give guys credit for 
effort and for staying in there. But momentum is killing us right now." 
</P>
<P>
 All-Star forward Larry Johnson, who needed five stitches above his left eye 
after bumping heads with Clipper rookie forward Lamond Murray in the second 
quarter, had 18 points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper centers Matt Fish, who got into early foul trouble, and Bob Martin 
were no match for Hornet center Alonzo Mourning, who had 13 points and 11 
rebounds as Charlotte beat the Clippers for the fourth time in their last five 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish, who played only nine minutes, was overmatched against Mourning, who made 
four of eight shots. Mourning talked trash to Fish, a rookie who spent last 
season in the CBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't complimenting me," Fish said. "It seems like all I can do out there 
right is foul. I can't stop from fouling out there. If you could set double 
figures in fouling, I think I'd be there every game." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who was activated Monday after center Elmore Spencer was placed on the 
injured list because of "apparent emotional and personal problems," looked 
rusty after missing the first 15 games because of a heel injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Mourning shook his head and ran up the court laughing after faking out Martin 
for an easy dunk in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers started the game with the NBA's second-worst defense, allowing an 
average of 109 points a game. Opponents have shot a league-high 50.3% against 
the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was evident why the Clipper defense is so bad. The Hornets shot a 
season-high 57.1%, making 44 of 77 shots, including eight three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Momentum is a vicious thing," Fitch said. "It goes both ways. I thought 
through the first 14 games we didn't show any signs of mental fatigue. We 
didn't show any signs of the bottom dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really the first game where the bottom just dropped out. This is 
really the first game where we haven't finished strong." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets outscored the Clippers, 20-9, in the final eight minutes of the 
third quarter to take an 83-58 lead going into the final quarter. They shot 67% 
in the fourth quarter and led by as many as 36 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Hornet guard Muggsy Bogues missed the second half after re-injuring his groin 
muscle. Bogues was originally injured in the first quarter of Charlotte's 
105-95 victory over the Knicks at New York on Nov. 26. . . . Pooh Richardson 
scored his 5,000th point in the third quarter on a free throw that came from a 
technical foul on Alonzo Mourning.

RAIDERS WIN FLAG FOOTBALL GAME; PRO FOOTBALL: THEY OVERCOME TEAM-RECORD 17 
PENALTIES TO DENY SAN DIEGO A CHANCE TO CLINCH THE AFC WEST TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Raiders couldn't seem to do anything right Monday night at Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 They couldn't seem to rush without going offside. 
</P>
<P>
 They couldn't seem to block without holding. 
</P>
<P>
 They couldn't seem to get a play off on time, run back a punt without 
illegally hitting somebody or run a play without doing something wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler couldn't seem to stay out of harm's way, even when 
he went out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of those nights for the Raiders. Ugly, frustrating, humiliating. 
</P>
<P>
 But they wouldn't change a minute of it. On a night when they tied a club 
record with 17 penalties that cost them 146 yards, the Raiders somehow emerged 
with perhaps their biggest victory of the season, 24-17, over the San Diego 
Chargers before a stunned and disappointed crowd of 63,012, largest for the 
team in the history of this stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team had a level of focus that I had not seen before," cornerback Albert 
Lewis said. "We were so focused, nothing really mattered." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if the Raiders took all the mistakes lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were at each other's throats the whole game," Lewis said. "We had every 
opportunity to lose that game, but we fought and fought. It wasn't pretty but 
we got it." 
</P>
<P>
 The fans had come to celebrate. After all, a victory would give their Chargers 
the AFC West championship. A defeat might sink the final hopes of the hated 
Raiders for a playoff spot. So they held their tailgate parties and waved their 
Charger towels and brought the decibel level up to the deafening mark before 
the opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional tide was going the Chargers' way. 
</P>
<P>
 But only until Hostetler got his hands on the ball. On the Raiders' first play 
from scrimmage, the Raider quarterback faked a handoff to tailback Harvey 
Williams and then spotted Alexander Wright downfield. Wright had broken free 
when safety Stanley Richard blew his assignment. Hostetler lofted a pass that 
Wright caught at the Charger 30-yard line and never looked back, completing a 
76-yard play. 
</P>
<P>
 The roar ended. A hush began. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the night was over, Hostetler would complete 22 of 29 passes for 319 
yards and throw the winning touchdown pass to Rocket Ismail, a six-yarder in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't all smiles and raised hands. Hostetler spent some nervous 
moments on the sidelines, holding a smashed and bloody left hand. He was hurt 
early in the second quarter when he rolled out of bounds after picking up a 
first down on a seven-yard run. Defensive back Darrien Gordon, pursuing 
Hostetler, stepped on his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The score then was even, San Diego quarterback Stan Humphries having hit Shawn 
Jefferson with a 29-yard touchdown pass to match the Hostetler-Wright scoring 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Vince Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 On his third play from scrimmage, Evans hit Ismail at the back of the end zone 
on a six-yard touchdown pass to put the Raiders back in front. 
</P>
<P>
 "With myself and other young receivers," Ismail said, "I don't think Jeff has 
the confidence level in us that he has in Tim (Brown). I've been working every 
day in practice to try to change that. Tonight, all that work paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Ismail's first touchdown catch of the night, the game was tied again 
before the half, however, when Gale Gilbert threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to 
Tony Martin. Gilbert replaced Humphries late in the half after the San Diego 
quarterback injured his thumb against an onrushing Raider. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had nine penalties in the first quarter alone, 14 by halftime. 
They came in every shape and form, enough flags for a presidential motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
 On one play late in the second quarter, Gordon was waiting to field a punt 
when an onrushing Dan Land leveled the Charger return man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the penalties I've no problem with," Raider linebacker Winston Moss 
said. "Our guys running around trying to knock the (stuff) out of somebody, 
that's good. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Dan Land did . . . I guarantee you (Gordon) fumbled at the end because 
he was worried about somebody taking his head off." 
</P>
<P>
 With three minutes to play, Gordon fumbled the ball on a punt, but recovered 
his own fumble. But he lost a chance for good field position, and the Chargers 
were unable to advance on that drive. Overall, he gained only 26 yards on two 
punts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both starting quarterbacks returned in the second half, Hostetler with his 
bruised left hand, Humphries with his sprained thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody scored again until the fourth quarter when the two teams matched 
field goals, Jeff Jaeger from 43 yards out, John Carney from 24 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders improved their record to 7-6, lowering the Chargers' to 9-4 and 
beating a team with a better-than-.500 record for the first time all year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders held the Chargers to 47 yards rushing, including only 41 for 
Natrone Means, who entered the weekend leading the AFC in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ugly night? It couldn't have been more beautiful for the Raiders.

NORTHERN MICHIGAN UPSETS CS BAKERSFIELD; VOLLEYBALL: TOP-RANKED ROADRUNNERS 
LOSE IN FOUR GAMES AS WILDCATS WIN SECOND CONSECUTIVE DIVISION II TITLE.

 It was fitting that Pauline Schuette made the winning kill to give Northern 
Michigan its second consecutive NCAA Division II volleyball title. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the best-known threat on the team, she was the one who made the difference 
in the title match as Northern Michigan defeated Cal State Bakersfield, 8-15, 
15-13, 15-8, 15-13, for the championship at Bakersfield on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuette had nine kills in the first three games of the match, but she had 13 
in the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield's All-American outside hitter, Christie Wieneke, nearly brought 
the Roadrunners back by herself with 30 kills -- 14 in the last game. Five of 
those came as Bakersfield turned back 12 match-point opportunities by Northern 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what it would feel like if that ball hit the floor, so I was going to 
do everything I could not to lose. If I was going to lose, I was going to lose 
swinging," Wieneke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Things started off well for Wieneke and Bakersfield (41-3), but Northern 
Michigan turned it around quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, Bakersfield came out with crisp passing and a defense that 
disrupted Northern Michigan's game. Wieneke spiked through two blockers several 
times to help the Roadrunners build an 11-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the second game, Wieneke was shut down. She was five of five in kill 
attempts in the first game, but the Wildcats decided to key on her. In the 
second game, she had six kills in 18 attempts with four errors. Northern 
Michigan was down, 7-1, but put together a string of nine consecutive points 
before winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield still did not adjust in the third game. Northern Michigan's Jennie 
Long got hot and the Wildcats won the easiest game. 
</P>
<P>
 The match was a rematch of last year's Division II final, but there were a few 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Mark Rosen's Bakersfield team was the nation's second-ranked team 
and was played at top-ranked Northern Michigan's gym. Northern Michigan won the 
1993 final in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Rosen coached fourth-ranked Northern Michigan, which earned a 
chance to play top-ranked Bakersfield at the Cal State Bakersfield Activities 
Center by defeating Central Missouri in three games Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Ferreira had led Bakersfield to a No. 1 ranking all season, with its only 
losses coming against Division I opponents. Bakersfield won the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. title for the fifth consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game, Northern Colorado defeated Central Missouri, 15-11, 
15-8, 15-10.

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: AZUSA, LA VERNE LOSE COACHING VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Southland football programs lost two prominent coaches to retirement at the 
end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
 One was expected, the other was a bit of a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Milhon, 60, who coached at Azusa Pacific for the last 17 years, had 
announced his plans to retire a year ago. But Rex Huigens' decision to step 
down at La Verne was unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 Milhon finished his coaching career with an 82-68-4 record and will move into 
an administrative position in the Azusa Pacific athletic department. He had 10 
winning seasons, including seven in succession to begin the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three head coaches at four-year colleges in California have served their 
schools longer: John Zinda at Claremont-Mudd for 26 years, Ray Solari at Menlo 
for 23 years and Terry Donahue at UCLA for 19 years. Solari also retired this 
season -- his last game a 32-17 loss to Milhon's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of odd that two coaches are walking away at the same time," Milhon 
said. "There have been so many unbelievable blessings to me and this football 
program since I've been here. They paid tribute to me (at the last home game), 
and a lot of former players came back to see me. But it wasn't just me they 
wanted to see, it was Azusa Pacific as well. I'm just part of a great process 
that goes on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific is continuing to interview for Milhon's successor and hopes to 
name one within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Huigens, 46, has been the head coach at La Verne for only four years, but he 
surprised everyone by deciding to step down after leading the Leopards to their 
most successful season. Actually, he turned in his letter of resignation before 
the season started and asked Jimmy Paschal, La Verne's athletic director, to 
keep it a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had gone 3-6, I probably would have asked to rescind it," Huigens said. 
"I wouldn't want to leave like that, and I wouldn't want to leave the program 
like that for the next person." 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne was 9-0 and won the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference title before losing in the first round of the Division II playoffs. 
The American Football Assn. named Huigens coach of the year for Region 5 of the 
non-Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Huigens had a 30-6-1 overall record and won the last two SCIAC championships. 
He will continue as La Verne's golf coach and an athletic administrator and 
will also continue to teach at the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the reason to step down is that the philosophy of the conference is 
changing, and we're getting more and more full-time coaches," he said. "I do so 
many things -- I'm a full-time professor, I coach the golf team, I am an 
administrator in the athletics office -- and I have a 12-year-old son I'd like 
to watch play. I don't think I want to give up all those to be a full-time 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like coaching, and I've been coaching at La Verne for 25 years -- 21 as a 
recruiter -- so it's not like I've only been here the last four years. The kind 
of season we had made it easier. I didn't want to hang on and stay too long. 
Maybe I am leaving too soon, but I'm leaving the door open. I just think it is 
best for La Verne to get a full-time coach, and best for me to step away while 
the program is in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Huigens will be replaced by his assistant of four years, Don Morel.

 The Azusa Pacific women's volleyball team looked as if it would cruise into 
the quarterfinals of the NAIA national tournament in Chattanooga, Tenn., last 
week, but things turned sour in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th-seeded Cougars won their first three matches of pool play in 
convincing fashion. They won nine of 10 games in those matches, including a 
sweep of second-ranked St. Francis of Joliet, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Those victories, however, did not assure Azusa Pacific of a trip to the 
quarterfinals, and the Cougars needed to beat Moorhead State of Minnesota in 
their last pool-play match to guarantee a spot in the quarterfinals. Instead, 
Azusa Pacific lost in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 That loss left a three-way tie for the two spots in the quarterfinals. St. 
Francis, Moorhead State and Azusa Pacific were all 3-1 in pool play. By virtue 
of tiebreakers, St. Francis was awarded the first spot and Azusa Pacific had to 
play Moorhead State in a one-game playoff to 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 That match was played 45 minutes after the Cougars had lost to Moorhead State, 
and Azusa Pacific lost again, 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a way to get bumped out," Azusa Pacific Coach Lori Kildal said. "I feel 
fortunate that we walked out of there 3-1 instead of 0-4, like some teams. We 
had a great season. It's just too bad the way it ended." 
</P>
<P>
 What haunts her is that if Azusa Pacific had won one more game in the match 
against Moorhead State, it would have avoided the one-game playoff and won the 
spot outright based on points scored in pool-play matches. 
</P>
<P>
 College Division Notes 
</P>

NAIA national tournament last week. The women's team lost in the semifinals to 
Park College of Parkville, Mo., 2-1, in overtime and finished the season at 
16-4-4. The men's team did not advance beyond pool play and finished the season 
at 21-4. . . . On Nov. 11, Pacific Christian beat Biola in basketball for the 
first time, 106-101.

COWBOYS, STEELERS TRY TO MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY WILNER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that qualifying for the playoffs is out of the way, the Dallas Cowboys and 
Pittsburgh Steelers can think about something bigger: home field in their 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, seeking to become the first team with three straight Super Bowl 
titles, clinched the NFC East on Sunday with a 31-19 victory at Philadelphia. 
Emmitt Smith rushed for 91 yards and two touchdowns as the Cowboys (11-2) 
didn't miss quarterback Troy Aikman in handing the Eagles their fourth 
successive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dallas couldn't gain on the red-hot San Francisco 49ers, who routed 
Atlanta 50-14 as Steve Young accounted for five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to stay on pace with San Francisco, we have to win the next three," 
quarterback Rodney Peete said. "But this was a big win for us. It means a lot 
(clinching the division), but we still have three games to go. Our goal is to 
get back to the Super Bowl and win it. We're a step closer." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh (10-3) secured at least a wild-card berth in the AFC and took the 
Central Division lead by routing Cincinnati 38-15. Bam Morris rushed for 108 
yards and a pair of touchdowns and Rod Woodson returned one of Pittsburgh's two 
interceptions for a TD. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers have won five straight for the first time since 1983, and moved 
one game in front of Cleveland, which lost to the New York Giants 16-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're playing very well," All-Pro cornerback Woodson said. "This 
team is so different. You can't even compare it to our teams the last few years 
that lost in the first round." 
</P>
<P>
 The AFC team that won the last four conference crowns, only to lose in the 
Super Bowl, stayed alive in the playoff chase. The Buffalo Bills scored 35 
second-half points in beating Miami 42-31. 
</P>
<P>
 In other games, it was Denver 20, Kansas City 17 in overtime; Detroit 34, 
Green Bay 31; Arizona 30, Houston 12; Indianapolis 31, Seattle 19; New England 
24, the New York Jets 13; Tampa Bay 26, Washington 21 and New Orleans 31, Rams 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, the Raiders are at San Diego. The week's action began with 
Minnesota's 33-27 overtime win over Chicago on Thursday night.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: GOLDEN WEST'S COACH SPEECHLESS AFTER 
TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The talent, the history and the desire were all in place for Golden West to 
win a State volleyball title Sunday at DeAnza College. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was one important thing missing -- the voice of Coach Albert 
Gasparian. Gasparian had been ill, and that combined with the stress of the 
tournament robbed his voice of most its strength by the time the Rustlers swept 
Cerritos in the title match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not from yelling," Gasparian said in a barely audible tone. "It's 
because I've been sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Gasparian's voice was so weak by the time the tournament ended that he was 
unable to call in the final results to newspapers. That responsibility fell to 
assistant coach Sabrina Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's written out what I'm supposed to say," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West avenged its only losses this season by sweeping Cerritos, 15-12, 
17-15, 15-9, in the title match. Golden West (25-2) lost to Cerritos (23-2) 
twice earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers also beat Cerritos, 15-1, 15-4, 13-15, 15-3, in the winners' 
bracket final Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Becca Foltz, who was out of step with the team earlier this season mainly 
because of a stomach injury, led the Rustlers in kills in the last two matches. 
She had 17 kills in the title match and 75 in tournament matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz, from Foothill High, won her second consecutive tournament most valuable 
player award. Vanessa Dahl (Huntington Beach High) and Christine Heims 
(Estancia High) also made the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive title and fourth in five years for Gasparian and 
Golden West. The Rustlers have a 134-7 record in the last five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing double: The State title was the sixth for Gasparian who has a record of 
261-32 in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 In an amazing coincidence, Ken Hamdorf, the Rustler water polo coach, has won 
six State titles and has a record of 262-32. One difference is that Hamdorf's 
record is in nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crowded house: Five of the eight Orange Empire Conference men's basketball 
teams play in the 16-team Riverside tournament that starts today. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (7-2) plays East Los Angeles at 3 p.m. and Riverside (7-2), the 
defending conference champion, takes on Citrus at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday: Golden West (3-4) plays Imperial Valley at 1 p.m.; Rio Hondo 
plays Fullerton (6-4) at 3 p.m. and Irvine Valley (5-4) takes on San Jacinto at 
7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament continues Thursday and Friday and the title game is at 7 p.m. 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (6-1) and Saddleback (5-2) are at the Santa Barbara tournament 
starting Thursday. Saddleback takes on Hancock at 5 p.m. and Rancho Santiago 
plays Ventura at 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast (5-2), the only Orange Empire Conference team not in a tournament 
this week, is at El Camino at 7:30 p.m. Friday and plays host to Los Angeles 
City at 7 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Women's basketball: Cypress, Golden West and Orange Coast, all of which 
reached the State tournament last spring, are off to solid starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast is 9-2, Golden West is 9-3, and Cypress is 7-3. With a few 
breaks, Golden West could have had an even better record. The Rustlers' three 
losses are by a combined five points. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Works, a sophomore forward at Cypress, has put on the best individual 
performance thus far. She is averaging 29 points and 13 rebounds and is 
shooting 59% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is 7-5, Rancho Santiago is 5-4, Saddleback is 2-3 and Riverside is 
2-4. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Football: Not only was Rancho Santiago Coach Dave Ogas depressed because his 
team lost the Simple Green Orange County Bowl to Los Angeles Valley, 36-28, 
Saturday, but it also meant the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogas was asked which was harder: Losing or saying goodby to a talented group 
of sophomores? "You get me thinking like that and I'll start to cry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the sophomores that Ogas will miss the most is quarterback Simon 
Fuentes who set a regular-season record with 19 touchdown passes. Beyond his 
statistics, Fuentes was a superb leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts," Fuentes said after the game. "But we didn't leave anything out on 
the field. We gave it our best shot, you just have to give the credit to L.A. 
Valley for getting the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More football: Before Fullerton's bowl game, Coach Gene Murphy asked that the 
individual school records that players were about to break, not be published 
until after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to get the players to concentrate on the team and not themselves. 
Well, Fullerton beat Hancock, 38-33, Saturday so the embargo is off. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark O'Brien, the Hornets' quarterback, set a single-season record for 
completions (193) and career marks for completion percentage (65%) and fewest 
interceptions (seven).

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; JOKE ON A BOX MAKES FOR BIG NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fox TV's NFL pregame show broke the big news Sunday morning: Boxes had been 
spotted in the Rams' scouting department and they were addressed to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the rest of the story . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There were three boxes there, all right; three boxes of 1988 college media 
guides that were going to be thrown out or given to some sports collector. As a 
joke, someone with the team had written on the boxes: "St. Louis Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN's Chris Mortensen, meanwhile, reported Sunday the Rams have a deal in 
place with St. Louis, and the announcement could come as early as Monday. An 
ESPN camera crew arrived Monday at Rams Park, but left without hearing any such 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson, who becomes a free agent at season's end, said 
he's tired of losing, but it won't necessarily force him to go elsewhere next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all fed up with losing," Anderson said. "We sat on an egg Sunday and it 
was ugly, but what can you do? You can only give it your best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're a good team. I like the guys here, the coaching staff and the 
organization has been good to me. If they want to have me, I'll come back. I'll 
be glad to stay in Southern California and play with the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 The coaching staff might change, however, and Southern California may no 
longer figure in the Rams' future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an optimist," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox pointed to two Todd Kinchen punt returns as one of the main 
reasons for the Rams' demise Sunday against the Saints. Kinchen has now fumbled 
away three punts in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints turned Kinchen's fumbles into 14 points, which should prompt the 
Rams into replacing Kinchen this week with Johnny Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinchen's reaction? After the game he ducked out of the locker room to avoid 
talking with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's response? "I had a bad game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saint quarterback Jim Everett spent $500 to treat his teammates, as well as 
the equipment men, trainers, coaches and front office staff to lunch at a deli 
to celebrate New Orleans' second victory in a row over the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about the cost, it was worth it, going 2-0 that way," Everett 
told the Associated Press. "I just enjoyed doing something for the guys. So 
many of them came up to me before the game and said 'Let's make this a team 
win,' Everybody wanted me to know they were behind me." T.J. SIMERS

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: WEEKEND OFFERS LAST CHANCE FOR FOOTBALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A guide to a weekend of championship football games, starting with the 
matchups and predicted outcomes: 
</P>
<P>
 CITY SECTION 
</P>
<P>
 Division 4-A--Sylmar 31, Crenshaw 14. Crenshaw is proving it is more than a 
basketball school, but the Cougars' lack of playoff experience will hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
 Division 3-A--Bell 24, Birmingham 14. The magic runs out for Birmingham, which 
opened the playoffs with a losing record. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTHERN SECTION 
</P>
<P>
 Division I--La Puente Bishop Amat 35, Santa Ana Mater Dei 10. Bishop Amat is 
in a class by itself, and Mater Dei is emotionally drained after beating Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Division II--Newhall Hart 38, Antelope Valley 21. There is no stopping Hart's 
offense, which has averaged 49 points per game during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Division III--Ayala 28, Sherman Oaks Notre Dame 24. Ayala Coach Mark 
Pasquarella has done wonders at a school in only its fourth year of varsity 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Division IV--Canyon Springs 28, Norco 13. Canyon Springs has been on a roll 
since losing its opener to Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 Division V--Anaheim Servite 23, Newport Harbor 17. Newport Harbor will have to 
wait another season for its first football title. 
</P>
<P>
 Division VI--Alta Loma 27, Ontario Chaffey 10. These teams met in a Mt. Baldy 
League game last month and Alta Loma won, 22-14. Look for a repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Division VII--Arroyo Grande 35, Manhattan Beach Mira Costa 21--Defense, which 
has carried Mira Costa this far, finally gives in. 
</P>
<P>
 Division VIII--Bloomington 45, La Mirada 14. The battle between two undefeated 
teams is no contest. The game is over at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Division IX--Nordhoff 31, Atascadero 17. Nordhoff denies Atascadero its second 
title in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Division X--Montclair Prep 35, Orange Lutheran 17--Free-lance entry Montclair 
Prep should have been put in a higher division. 
</P>
<P>
 Division XI--Morro Bay 28, Boron 21. Morro Bay cashes in on a major home-field 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rating the schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Bloomington at La Mirada, Friday, 7:30 p.m.--Start a hectic weekend by 
watching the nation's all-time, single-season scoring champion. Bloomington set 
the record Saturday with its 34-21 victory over Laguna Hills. The Bruins have 
scored 832 points in 13 games for a 64-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Sylmar vs. Crenshaw at El Camino College, Saturday, noon--The weekend's 
only afternoon game will yield the major division champion in the City Section. 
Sylmar, which won the title two years ago, hopes to finish with its best 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Bishop Amat vs. Mater Dei at Anaheim Stadium, Saturday, 7:40 p.m.--Although 
this attractive matchup of 13-0 teams will be televised live on Channel 13, 
what better way to watch a game than in person? Southern Section officials are 
hoping for a bigger crowd than the 30,065 that witnessed Mater Dei's 28-24 
comeback victory over Los Alamitos last Friday at the Big A. That crowd was the 
fifth-largest in section history. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Player-of-the-year candidates still playing: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Daylon McCutcheon, Bishop Amat--The three-year two-way starter is only 5 
feet 10, 175 pounds, but he is at the top of everybody's recruiting list. He 
rushed for 2,251 yards and is equally impressive on defense and special teams. 
Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson said McCutcheon is the best back he has ever 
faced and that's saying quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 2. John Flynn, Mater Dei--As the starting quarterback, Flynn has led the 
Monarchs to consecutive title game appearances. He has passed for more than 
2,000 yards this season and rallied Mater Dei to a pair of late touchdowns 
against Los Alamitos last week. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Kory Minor, Bishop Amat--Minor is another two-way starter for the Lancers, 
but he is best known for his skills in the defensive line. He has 20 sacks and 
seems to be in on every tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorable mention: Ted Iacenda, running back, Hart; Chris Sailer, kicker, 
Notre Dame; Ryan Roques, quarterback, Canyon Springs, and Greg Oliver, running 
back, Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Playoff leftovers: Mater Dei's Rollinson, attending a football media luncheon 
Monday, said his administrators could not attend because they were preparing 
for a rosary Saturday night. Bishop Amat hopes the joke proves true. . . . 
Chaffey Coach Bart Goldstein said his team has been so impressed with 
McCutcheon this season that it wanted a group autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 The Division I title game had been scheduled for Cerritos College, which holds 
12,000. Southern Section Commissioner Dean Crowley said he planned to bring in 
extra bleachers to boast capacity to 15,000. That idea was scrapped last week 
when it appeared the finalists would be big draws. Crowley said the section is 
on the verge of signing a five-year contract with Anaheim Stadium for its 
Division I championship. A contract could help lower operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Note 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor concluded one of the most dominating seasons ever by an area 
girls' volleyball team. The Sailors defeated Stockton St. Mary's, 15-4, 16-14, 
15-10, in the State Division I championship last Saturday at Cal State 
Fullerton. They lost only one game in four state tournament matches to finish 
with a 33-1 record. Senior Misty May is expected to be chosen the nation's top 
player this season. She has signed with Long Beach State. Times' Top 20

LONG BEACH STATE NOTEBOOK / JASON REID; 49ERS ARE STILL REVELING IN SPIRIT OF 
PYRAMID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The festive mood surrounding last week's opening of The Pyramid is still very 
present in the Long Beach State athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expected a large crowd for the inaugural men's basketball game 
Wednesday night against Detroit Mercy. They weren't disappointed, as 5,021 -- 
the largest on-campus crowd in school history -- watched the 49ers win their 
season-opener, 71-64. 
</P>
<P>
 There were even people hanging around The Pyramid hours before the game, 
asking: "Anyone got tickets?" Previously, giving 49er tickets away wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has them especially giddy in the athletic offices is the turnout for 
Saturday's game against College of Notre Dame, a Division II school from 
Belmont in the Bay Area. As expected, Long Beach routed the Argonauts, 96-68. 
However, there was a surprise: a crowd of 3,247. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of the skeptics, I thought there were going to be about 1,200 
people here tonight," Coach Seth Greenberg said after the game. "I was wrong. 
It's great to see the community turn out and be enthusiastic and excited. The 
community was more enthusiastic than my team was." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd size also impressed Bill Shumard, 49er assistant athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was as gratified with Saturday as I was with Wednesday," he said. "We knew 
that game was going to be a tough sell." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pyramid ticket office made $2,100 in walk-up sales, Shumard said. Usually, 
Shumard said, the school would only do that much walk-up business in The Gold 
Mine for games against Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the attendance probably would have been significantly higher had 
a school newspaper correctly listed the game time as 7 p.m. instead of 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say," Shumard said, "that we're not going to have a quieter day in 
The Pyramid all season." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guard that guy! So, who's the 49ers' best three-point shooter? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that distinction belongs to 49er Athletic Director Dave O'Brien, Shumard 
said. O'Brien had the long-range touch working late Wednesday night when elated 
athletic officials and support staff played a pickup game in The Pyramid after 
the basketball team's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get out of there until 4 a.m.," Shumard said. "The clean-up crew 
stopped and watched. Everyone worked so hard, it was the perfect ending to the 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien was the star -- and Shumard insists no one took it easy on the boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best shooter in the entire program," Shumard said, jokingly. "Too 
bad he's out of eligibility." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Please, be patient: They'll come if you build it -- but then you have to let 
them play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in last week's euphoria is the fact that The Pyramid is not finished. The 
company building it, Nielsen Construction of San Diego, only loaned the 
building to the athletic administration for Wednesday's nationally televised 
game on ESPN. No construction occurred over the weekend, allowing the school to 
also schedule the men's basketball game against College of Notre Dame and the 
NCAA women's volleyball tournament match against Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's back to The Gold Mine for the Northwest Regional volleyball 
semifinals and final this weekend. The athletic administration heard grumblings 
last week from the women's basketball team about not yet being able to play its 
games in The Pyramid. The school probably won't take possession of the building 
until January. The only other event in The Pyramid before then will be a men's 
basketball game against Montana Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Concessions have been made to work around the men's basketball schedule 
because of season ticket sales. Expected crowds cannot fit in The Gold Mine and 
games would have to be moved to the Long Beach Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very difficult and sensitive issue, but the building doesn't belong to 
us yet," Shumard said. "This will be forgotten once we're in there, and up and 
running." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Revenge factor? The women's volleyball team hasn't lost since it was defeated 
by Hawaii, 15-10, 15-5, 16-14, in a Big West Conference match Nov. 2 at The 
Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach recovered from the loss and won its fourth straight conference 
title. Still, the 49ers haven't forgotten the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Their chance to do something about it arrives at 8 p.m. Friday, when they play 
Hawaii in a Northwest Regional semifinal match at The Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach is 26-5. Hawaii, the Big West runner-up, is 25-4. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Making the point: True it's early, but point guard Rasul Salahuddin has been 
all Greenberg hoped he'd be. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior transfer from Dixie College in Utah averaged 11 points, six assists 
and five steals in two games. A converted shooting guard, Salahuddin, 6 feet 4, 
should be able to overpower most point guards and is also extremely quick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited about Rasul," Greenberg said. "He gives us a presence we 
haven't had."

 Buz Greene of Thousand Oaks fired a one-under-par 71 Monday to win the 
Southern California Golf Assn.'s 20th Tournament of Club Champions at North 
Ranch Country Club in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene, club champion at Saticoy Country Club near Camarillo, held off John 
Wardrup (Torrey Pines) by one shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The event pitted 95 individual men's club champions from throughout the 
Southland. Gary Klahn of Agoura and Lee Davis of Thousand Oaks finished in a 
four-way tie for third at 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Port of Chatsworth and Bill O'Connor, club champion at North Ranch, 
finished in a tie for seventh at two-over 74. Former Cal State Northridge 
standout Rick Sessinghaus tied for 13th with a 75. Girls' Tennis 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Julia Feldman of Taft High advanced to the semifinals of the 
City Section girls' individual tennis tourney with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Leslie 
Musser of Van Nuys at the Racquet Centre Monday in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, a senior who is 46-2 over three seasons, said she was tired from 
playing three matches in a juniors tournament last weekend and didn't get 
warmed up until the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman will face Ilona Kordanskay of Los Angeles High in Wednesday's 
semifinals. Kordanskay has won all three of her matches in the tournament by 
6-0, 6-0 scores. She was ranked 53rd in the 14-and-under division by the 
Southern California Tennis Assn. last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In quarterfinal doubles matches, Stephanie Shapiro and Terri Rosenthal of Taft 
defeated Alison Fischer and Jennie Wilson of Palisades, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4. Carolyn 
Lee and Brenda Moore of Palisades defeated Taft's Ravid Levy and Alicia Whelan, 
7-5, 5-7, 7-6 (8-6). DANA HADDAD

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; ELWAY PLANNING ON FACING RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Elway's knee injury isn't as serious as first thought, and the Denver 
Bronco quarterback intends to play Sunday against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real encouraging right now," Coach Wade Phillips said. "There is a 
possibility he can play. It depends on how he responds to treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Elway twisted his knee during a quarterback sneak in the fourth quarter 
against Kansas City on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors diagnosed the injury to Elway's left knee as a strained muscle with 
mildly stretched ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway said he is sore, but looking toward the Raider game. He also said he 
hopes to keep the Broncos alive for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sights are set on Sunday," he said. "I'm planning on playing, but it's 
hard to say right now." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Rick Mirer's broken left thumb has cost him the rest of his 
Seattle Seahawk season. The right-handed Mirer was scheduled to have surgery 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rick's definitely out for the next two games and we're not in the playoff 
picture at this point," Coach Tom Flores said, "so it wouldn't make sense for 
him to try to play in the third week." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores said Dan McGwire will start in Mirer's place in Seattle's final three 
games against Houston, the Raiders and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Frier, the Seattle Seahawk tackle who broke his neck in a car accident, 
can flex his biceps but can't move his legs or fingers and probably never will, 
a doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no sensation below his belly button," neurosurgeon Michael Schlitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frier, 25, remained in serious condition Monday, heavily sedated and with his 
skull and spine in traction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh Steelers running back Barry Foster has two broken bones in his 
lower back, not a bruise as initially diagnosed. He could play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster sat out the Steelers' 38-15 victory Sunday in Cincinnati, but probably 
will play next Sunday against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster's broken bones are in the lower back and, while painful, can heal while 
he continues to play, doctors said.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman, who has been out because of a sprained 
ligament in his left knee, was expected to return to practice and possibly 
start against Cleveland on Saturday. Cowboy special teams ace Bill Bates had 
surgery to repair a broken right thumb, and Joe Fishback was activated. . . . 
Eagle coach Rich Kotite said he will consider benching quarterback Randall 
Cunningham, who threw an interception that was returned 94 yards by Cowboy 
safety Darren Woodson on Sunday. . . . Chief coach Marty Schottenheimer said he 
won't know for a few days whether quarterback Joe Montana will be able to play 
Monday against Miami. . . . Minnesota put tight end Adrian Cooper on injured 
reserve because of a shoulder injury and filled his roster spot with free agent 
linebacker Richard Brown. . . . A woman who claimed she was raped by Cincinnati 
Bengal football players in a Seattle-area motel must abide by a $30,000 
settlement she accepted, but her children may be able to sue independently, a 
federal appeals court ruled. . . . Green Bay Packer defensive tackle Gilbert 
Brown is believed to have knee ligament damage that will end his season.

CHARGERS HAD HOPED TO CLINCH, BUT IT WAS NOT A CINCH; PRO FOOTBALL: INSTEAD OF 
POINTING FINGERS, SAN DIEGO GIVES THE RAIDERS ALL THE CREDIT IN BIG LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans dressed in blue with lightning bolts on their clothes came in record 
numbers to Jack Murphy Stadium on Monday night to watch their beloved Chargers 
clinch the AFC West Division title against the hated rivals from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 What they witnessed, instead, was an old-fashioned beating that was punctuated 
by pass-rushing specialist Aaron Wallace's sack of Stan Humphries of San Diego 
on the game's final play. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just came in here and gave us a sound wuppin'," said San Diego safety 
Stanley Richard of the Raiders' 24-17 victory. "They played sound football and 
kept us off balance the whole game. You have to give them credit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers did not blame anyone or anything for their loss. They only wanted 
to credit the Raiders for spoiling their planned division-clinching party. 
</P>
<P>
 "We missed a golden opportunity," San Diego Coach Bobby Ross said. "They just 
whipped us. They beat us in about every fashion of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened? 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't overachieving San Diego start the weekend sky-high and tied for the 
best record in the AFC at 9-3? Didn't the underachieving Raiders crawl into the 
game at 6-6 after an 18-point loss at home to Pittsburgh? 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't make any excuses because they were the better team today," 
linebacker Junior Seau said. "This game hurts. It definitely hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego's problems started on the Raiders' first play from scrimmage when 
Jeff Hostetler threw to Alexander Wright on a 76-yard touchdown bomb to put the 
Raiders up, 7-0, before many of their fans shook their first white rally flag. 
</P>
<P>
 "On that opening play, we just got totally fooled," Ross said. "We were really 
out of sync coverage-wise." 
</P>
<P>
 The player who was really surprised was Richard, who decided to chase tight 
end Andrew Glover across the field instead of retreating to help cornerback 
Dwayne Harper cover Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 "That play really tells the story about how we played," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was lack of discipline on my part because I've seen that play too many 
times not to recognize it. I was trying to make something happen, instead of 
doing my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Breakdowns cost the Chargers all night. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter with the score tied at 17, San Diego was threatening with 
a long, 13-play drive. But Natrone Means fumbled after being hit by Chester 
McGlockton and Anthony Smith at the Raider 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretty much cost us," said Means, who finished with 41 yards in 18 carries. 
"It happened so fast. I didn't know what happened. The ball just came out." 
</P>
<P>
 Another missed opportunity came in the fourth quarter when the Chargers had 
the ball at their 44-yard line with 3:00 left. Normally, San Diego turns to 
talented back Ronnie Harmon in such a situation, but not Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 On first down, Humphries passed to Means for six yards. On second, Means ran 
up the middle for one yard. On third and fourth downs, Humphries threw 
incomplete to wide receiver Mark Seay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, there's a combination of things going wrong for us," said Harmon, 
who caught four passes for 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just one thing. We're not playing good football right now and the 
Raiders showed that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, San Diego's task does not get easier as they must play host to the 
San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of clinching against the Raiders, the Chargers might be looking at a 
battle to have a home game in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there's a lot to be worked on," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have to do more than anything is put that behind you and get on to 
the next ballgame. We can still win it, but it isn't going to be easy."

NEWSWIRE: THE POND WILL BE SITE OF 1998 NCAA REGIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pond of Anaheim will be the site of the West Regional of the 1998 men's 
basketball tournament, the NCAA has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ecstatic," said Dennis Farrell, commissioner of the Big West 
Conference, which will play host to the event."You take the excitement of last 
weekend's (John R. Wooden Classic) tournament and add the importance of the 
winner going on to the Final Four, and you can certainly see how big this is." 
</P>
<P>
 Arena spokesman John Nicoletti said officials were excited about the event as 
they awaited final word "especially given the atmosphere over the weekend" 
after the inaugural Wooden Classic drew a sell-out crowd of 18,307. 
</P>
<P>
 Other 1998 regional sites announced Monday were Greensboro (N.C.) Coliseum, 
the ThunderDome in St. Petersburg, Fla. (Southeast) and the new Kiel Center in 
St. Louis (Midwest). The 1998 Final Four was previously awarded to the 
Alamodome in San Antonio, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Anaheim was in the running to host a 1997 regional but was edged 
out by San Jose Arena after failing to secure the recommendation of the 
basketball committee, partly because the facility hadn't played host to a 
basketball game then and was set up for hockey when NCAA officials visited. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a little leery of recommending The Pond until it had hosted 
basketball," Farrell said. "But since last year, Long Beach played Memphis 
there, there have been a couple of Clippers games and you had the great 
tournament last weekend, after the decision was already rendered. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is big. This is one of the great events in America, with all the 
excitement and hoopla of college sports. We're just happy we can play a part in 
helping bring it to Orange County." ROBYN NORWOOD

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; BAKER STICKS TO HIS BASIC PHILOSOPHY: KEEP 
ANTEATERS ON THE RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Baker stood at the podium in a banquet room of an Iowa City motel, in 
front of a couple hundred Iowa high school coaches with pens and clipboards at 
the ready, and explained the nuances of the Anteaters' secondary break. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a lot more than just chalk talk during Baker's session of a 
coaching clinic Saturday before the final round of the Hawkeye Invitational 
tournament. In between diagrams of flashing wing players, staggered screens and 
plays he stole from the Seattle SuperSonics, the Clippers and Bob Knight, Baker 
gave some insight into his basic philosophies of the game: 
</P>
<P>
 * "We feel we have to push the ball up the floor every night, every time we 
get the ball. We want our wings and posts to run all the time, if only for the 
reason to make your wings and posts run all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We count on being as fit, or more fit, than you and we're going to test your 
fitness every night. I plead with our guys to run, run, run and sometimes we 
have to explain to them that they will be on a very short leash if they don't 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shot clock keeps running down. It's at 35 (seconds) now and soon it'll be 
30. It's becoming more and more important to get the best possible shot in the 
quickest amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
 * "I'm a shooter's dream. I tell all our wing players that if you can make a 
shot, you're not doing the team any service if you pass that shot up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course Chris Brown has always taken that to heart. In his first game last 
year, against Georgetown in the USA Arena where they have the college 
(three-point) line and the pro line, the first two shots of his college career 
were from a step beyond the pro line. And he buried them both. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since then, he's believed that there's a shot on the end of every pass." 
</P>
<P>
 * "We opened at Oklahoma, then faced a top 20 team (Ohio University) here and 
we still have to play at Arizona State. We don't play a game at home until late 
December. So the guy who made this schedule is a fool. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think we had to create these situations because I don't think playing 
at those places are anymore difficult than playing in Logan, Utah, or Las 
Cruces, N.M., or Las Vegas, and we're going to have to do that in conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a new team and you can't tell players what it's like. They have to 
experience it. But if we can come out of this intact, physically, of course, 
but especially mentally, I think we'll be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good mornings: Baker, glancing over his shoulder at the screen to view his 
handiwork on the overhead projector: "You know, these plays always work on 
these things at 9:45 in the morning. It all looks real good. Let's hope it 
works half this good tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Off schedule: Iowa administrative assistant Jerry Strom revealed why Irvine 
played Ohio University and the Hawkeyes played Pepperdine in the first round of 
the Hawkeye Invitational tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we went out to Irvine thinking we'd have this nice little winter 
vacation in California," he said. "At least that's what the players thought. 
Coaches are smart enough to know you have to be ready to play every night. 
Anyway, we came away with a very humiliating (86-78) loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, everyone wanted to get even for that game, but Coach (Tom) Davis 
took all the emotion out of it, looked at Rod's recruiting class, their overall 
personnel and said, 'No, we'll play Pepperdine.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which direction? The Anteaters call the play that Baker borrowed from the 
Sonics "Misdirection." It is designed to end in two screens for Brown and a 
three-point attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker estimates that at least half of Brown's 122 three-pointers last season 
came as a result of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the conference championship game (against New Mexico State) we ran that 
play to death and Chris had 11 threes," Baker said. "Actually, he made a 12th 
but the referee called an illegal screen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters are still running the play, but Brown is struggling. Winning the 
national three-point shooting title has become a bit of an anchor for him. He 
has been dragging at least one very determined defender with him everywhere he 
goes on the court this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has connected on only nine of 27 three-pointers and admits he's been 
pressing to live up to his title as the nation's No. 1 three-point shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Battle won? Junior forward Shaun Battle was ejected from the Anteaters' 
first game for supposedly throwing a punch and then fouled out of their second. 
But he had nine points, six rebounds and only one foul in 17 minutes of 
Irvine's 75-68 victory over Pepperdine in the consolation game of the Iowa 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shaun settled down and played well," Baker said. "The more we have him on the 
floor, the better we can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun said he's learned his lesson and now is Mr. Nice Guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm done with all that other stuff," he said, smiling. "It's all gone. You 
won't see it no more." 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater notes 
</P>
<P>
 Water polo Coach Ted Newland has been named head coach for the U.S. team in 
the World University Games next summer in Japan. Newland also coached the team 
in 1973, '77 and '91 . . . Senior Peter Muller was an honorable mention 
All-Mountain Pacific Sports Federation selection. He led the water polo team in 
scoring with 43 points, including eight two-point goals.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; VILLANOVA DOWNS SETON HALL IN BIG EAST OPENER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kerry Kittles scored 25 points and Jonathan Haynes had 21 points and six 
assists as No. 24 Villanova defeated Seton Hall, 98-75, in a Big East opener 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin Williams added 20 points and eight assists for the Wildcats (4-1). Jason 
Lawson added 18 points for the Wildcats, who shot 60%. Danny Hurley had 13 
points and Donnell Williams 12 for Seton Hall (2-2). 
</P>
<P>
 "Offensively, that's as well as we can play," Villanova Coach Steve Lappas 
said. "But defensively, the first half was as poorly as we can play." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 Kansas 91, Coppin State 69 -- Jerod Haase scored a career-high 22 points 
and Raef LaFrentz added 16 as the Jayhawks shot 57% and made 12 three-point 
shots to win at Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas (3-0), which defeated then-No. 1 Massachusetts on Saturday at Anaheim, 
was 12 of 21 from three-point range and pulled away early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Haase, a transfer from California, scored the first nine points for the 
Jayhawks on three consecutive three-point baskets as Kansas opened a 13-5 lead. 
Coppin State (0-3) countered with a 10-1 run led by seven of Stephen Stewart's 
14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Maryland 102, Maryland Baltimore County 77 -- Joe Smith broke a 
two-game slump with 20 points and Exree Hipp also scored 20 as the Terrapins 
cruised at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland (5-1) led by as many as 35 in the second half en route to its 32nd 
consecutive nonconference home victory. Keith Booth had 16 points and Smith had 
12 rebounds as Maryland topped the 100-point mark for the second game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 23 Michigan 87, Detroit 76 -- Ray Jackson scored six of his 20 points down 
the stretch and the Wolverines held off a late rally at Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first home game for Michigan (4-2). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 25 Wake Forest 74, Canisius 60 -- Ricardo Peral had 19 points and eight 
rebounds and Randolph Childress scored 18 as the Demon Deacons won at Buffalo, 
N.Y. Peral, a sophomore forward from Valladolid, Spain, was averaging 3.0 
points a game, but stepped up in response to Childress' public challenge to his 
teammates after an 81-70 loss to Florida on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Peral's three-point shot with 5:57 left put Wake Forest (3-1) ahead, 58-43, 
and all but ended the Golden Griffin's hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe Lopez did not disappoint in his Big East Conference debut, scoring 23 
points as St. John's opened a 23-point first-half lead before holding off 
Pittsburgh for an 88-83 victory at Pittsburgh. Lopez, probably the most 
publicized Big East recruit since Patrick Ewing, used his acrobatic spin moves 
and a succession of steals to key first-half runs of 17-0 and 19-6 that put the 
Red Storm up, 48-23. . . . Kiwane Garris scored 15 points, including two late 
free throws, to help Illinois to a 76-69 victory over Kansas State at 
Manhattan, Kan. . . . Louisville's Tick Rogers scored seven points and Alvin 
Sims had five during a 22-4 first-half run as the Cardinals snapped a 
three-game losing streak with a 108-76 victory over Western Carolina at 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerald Honeycutt scored seven of his 27 points in overtime to lead Tulane 
(4-1) to an 85-80 victory over Old Dominion at New Orleans. . . . H Waldman 
scored 22 points to lead St. Louis to a 72-65 victory over Southern Illinois at 
Carbondale, Ill. . . . Georgia Southwestern defeated Claflin College, 50-18, 
after officials called the game at Americus, Ga., with 16:19 left because of a 
wet floor. Said Bill Nicholson, sports information director: "It was kind of 
like a film over the floor."

LOYOLA MARYMOUNT LOSES IN OVERTIME; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: NOTRE DAME LEADS FOR 
MOST OF THE GAME, BUT LIONS' ODUOK AND WILLIAMSON MAKE THE IRISH EARN THEIR 
76-73 VICTORY. 
</P>

 Loyola Marymount, giddy from its best start in eight seasons and a furious 
second-half comeback that had Notre Dame on its heels, was brought back to 
earth when it broke down at the end of Monday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions, who had overcome a 14-point deficit, failed to finish off the 
comeback and lost in overtime, 76-73, before 3,289 at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our heart and effort and passion were there," Coach John Olive said, "but we 
made a lot of mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their hard work, the Lions couldn't overcome them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely had it," said sophomore point guard Jim Williamson, who played 
all 45 minutes and scored 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite making only 41.4% of its shots and only 22 of 40 free throws, Loyola 
(3-1) rallied from an 11-point second-half deficit and took its only lead of 
the game at 66-64 on a layup by senior guard Robin Kirksey with 90 seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end, reserve guard Keith Kurowski, who led the Irish (3-1) with 
19 points, missed a running bank shot and Loyola's Ime Oduok took the rebound, 
giving the Lions a 20-1 rebound advantage in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Williamson missed an off-balance jumper with about 20 seconds to play 
and Notre Dame got the rebound, Kirksey committed an ill-advised foul from 
behind as Ryan Hoover dribbled the ball across mid-court. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover made two free throws with 17.2 seconds left in regulation, pulling the 
Irish even, before teammate Pat Garrity made a curious move. 
</P>
<P>
 As Loyola inbounded the ball, the freshman forward intentionally fouled Oduok, 
whose poor free-throw shooting had kept the Irish in the game despite his 27 
points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrity went to the bench with his fifth foul, joining two other Irish big men 
-- Matt Gotsch and Marcus Young -- who fouled out trying to check Oduok. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got mixed up there," Irish Coach John MacLeod said. "We only wanted to 
foul if we (were trailing)." 
</P>
<P>
 But Oduok, who made only 11 of his school-record 23 free throws, made it look 
like a brilliant move, missing two foul shots with 16.7 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover missed a three-point shot at the buzzer, but Notre Dame never trailed 
in overtime, building a 74-69 lead before Loyola rallied again to pull to 
within 74-73. Williamson, though, was called for a flagrant foul while trying 
to stop Derek Manner on a breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Manner missed both free throws with 44.2 seconds to play, but the Irish 
retained possession. Hoover missed a driving bank shot as the clock wound down, 
but the rebound kicked out to Kurowski, who was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
 His two free throws made the score 76-73 with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola had one more chance, but Williamson's three-point attempt was blocked 
by Irish forward Billy Taylor.

 Laguna Hills' Brendan McGraw gained 100 yards in Saturday's 34-21 loss to 
Colton Bloomington in the Division VIII semifinals to give him 2,511 yards for 
the season and the county rushing title by 11 yards over Costa Mesa's Charles 
Chatman. McGraw's total was short of Jeff Byrd's county record of 2,596 yards 
set in 1992 at Rancho Alamitos. 
</P>

 McGraw also scored a touchdown Saturday, giving him 42, adding to his 
single-season county record. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't care about individual goals; he was concerned about the team 
winning and not winning," Laguna Hills Coach Steve Bresnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll appreciate much later what he did, but he knows he had some pretty good 
linemen blocking for him. . . . It will be a long-term reward, but he's 
disappointed he's not still playing." MIKE TERRY

NBA ROUNDUP; KNICKS GO OVERTIME TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Starks had a chance to win the game in regulation and shot an airball. 
Yet, when he had a chance to put the New York Knicks ahead in overtime, he did 
not hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks' three-pointer from the top of the key negated the only basket the 
Philadelphia 76ers' had in overtime and put the Knicks ahead for good in a 
101-96 victory Monday night at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confidence-wise, I don't lack any of that," Starks said. "It's just being 
comfortable out there on the court. Right now, I'm just not into a good 
rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
 Starks, who scored 16 points, is dissatisfied with his average of 14 points a 
game this season. But the five points he scored in overtime will help make him 
feel as if he is contributing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to keep working hard at it, and all of a sudden it will pop into 
place and everything will come together," he said. "I never give up on myself 
or doubt myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The shot made amends for Starks' bad miss with 3.3 seconds left in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Smith, who scored four of his 20 points in overtime, also played well 
when the Knicks needed him the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to try to do the little things that will help us to victory," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia Coach John Lucas, whose team had enjoyed a modest two-game 
winning streak, said he liked what he saw on the floor -- and after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our locker room tonight, it looked like it hurt, and that's a good sign," 
said Lucas, in his first year with a team that won only 25 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's Patrick Ewing led all scorers with 25 points. Dana Barros led the 
76ers with 22 points, and Willie Burton and Wright had 19 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 99, Chicago 94 -- Armon Gilliam scored 11 of his 24 points in the 
third quarter at Chicago, leading the Nets from a 19-point deficit to a victory 
that ended a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 With 5:18 left, New Jersey took its first lead, 86-85, on a Gilliam's drive. 
Gilliam made two free throws with 2:58 remaining to give New Jersey a 92-90 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Myers then grabbed a loose ball and passed to Scottie Pippen who was 
driving the lane for the dunk, tying it 92-92 with 1:49 left. With 1:19 to 
play, Kenny Anderson was fouled by Larry Krystkowiak. Anderson made one of two 
free throws, giving the Nets the lead for good at 93-92. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was fouled with 17 seconds left by Steve Kerr and made both free 
throws for a 95-92 lead. Sleepy Floyd sealed the victory with two more free 
throws with four seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets, paced by Gilliam, rallied in the third quarter, trimming a 63-44 
halftime deficit to 82-76 entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen led the Bulls with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Daugherty of the Cleveland Cavaliers had two herniated disks removed from 
his lower back and will be sidelined for the rest of the regular season. There 
is a remote chance the 29-year-old center could return for the playoffs in 
April. Daugherty, a five-time all-star, missed the final 29 games of last 
season and hasn't played at all this season. Daugherty, a five-time all-star, 
missed the final 29 games of last season and hasn't played this season. . . . 
Houston's Vernon Maxwell was fined $5,000 by the NBA for his failure to leave 
the court in a timely fashion and verbally abusing officials after he was 
ejected in the fourth quarter of the Rockets' 113-109 victory over Golden State 
on Thursday.

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; MUIR CLOSE, BUT MATER DEI WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei is no doubt a good basketball team, and when the Monarchs get Schea 
Cotton back, the Monarchs probably will be a great team. But in their season 
opener against Pasadena Muir, the Monarchs showed they can be had. 
</P>
<P>
 The final score, 60-45, that Mater Dei recorded against the Mustangs on 
Monday, in front of about 500 at the Bren Center, was deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
 After recovering from a cold-shooting first quarter, Muir got within 45-43 
with less than four minutes to play, and had a fastbreak opportunity to even 
the score and really make the Monarchs think about the possibility of being 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mustangs missed the layup and Mater Dei shut the door for good, 
outscoring Muir, 15-2, in the remaining 3 minutes 43 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Monarch guard Clay McKnight led all scorers with 18 points. Shaun Jackson -- 
stepping in for Cotton who is sidelined with a bad rash -- had 15 points and 14 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Quincy Stinson sank five three-pointers to lead the Mustangs with 15 points, 
followed by Duane Curtis with 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like opening-night jitters out there," said Monarch Coach Gary 
McKnight after he watched his team nearly fritter away a 12-point second-half 
lead. "Obviously we missed Schea, who is a big part of our offense. We have 
some young players, so this was a good experience for them. But we have to get 
better before we go to some of these national tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
 Muir Coach Rocky Moore, also playing a young team, knew his team came 
thisclose to stealing the game from Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first quarter we had our chances, but too many of our shots that 
usually go down didn't," Moore said. "As the game progressed we got better, and 
if we tie it up, who knows? But also give credit to Mater Dei; they shut us 
down those last few minutes. We had made a big push to get back in the game and 
ran out of gas." 
</P>
<P>
 By all rights, Muir (1-2) should have been blown out in the first quarter. The 
Mustangs made only one of 14 shots, and that was a three-pointer by Curtis. 
They would not make their second field goal until 5:15 was left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Monarchs (1-0), save for McKnight and Jackson, were not much warmer. 
They led, 14-3, after the first quarter, and were outscored, 17-9, in the 
second. The Mustangs discovered Mater Dei could be disrupted by a pressuring, 
halfcourt trap defense, and whittled the deficit to 23-20 by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Costa Mesa tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa 54, Southern California Christian 48 -- Mike Montoya made a 
three-pointer with about 30 seconds left to clinch the first-round game for 
Costa Mesa. Montoya scored 16 points for the Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Cameron, who scored a game-high 28 points, fouled out with about three 
minutes left and SCC leading by one. 
</P>
<P>
 University 76, Saddleback 63 -- Steve McKee scored 23 points and grabbed 10 
rebounds and freshman Fred Sears scored 14 and had nine steals for University 
(1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Century 56, Bolsa Grande 33 -- Vibul Ros and Hector Beltran each scored 13 
points to lead Century, which outscored the Matadors, 34-15, in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 In the La Quinta tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Katalla 72, Marina 42 -- LaByron Clayton scored 23 points and added nine 
rebounds for Katella, which led, 33-18, at the half. Carlos Romero had 15 
points and Mike Pahl had 13 points and nine rebounds for the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach 50, Garden Grove 48 (OT) -- Gregory Osborne and Nick Beimfohr 
each scored 12 points for Laguna Beach. Osborne and Brandon Block each scored 
four points in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the In-N-Out tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora 65, Agoura 58 -- Seven-footer Craig Clark led Sonora (1-1) with 20 
points as the Raiders took a 29-20 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood 63, Fountain Valley 51 -- Paul Tayyar had 19 points for Fountain 
Valley, which trailed by three at the half, but was outscored, 39-30, in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills 88, Long Beach St. Anthony 40 -- Jon Paisley scored a game-high 
18 to lead the Mustangs. Rob Warnick had 13 points and Brandon Monroe 11. Matt 
Grace led the team in rebounds with 10. Trabuco Hills will play Long Beach 
Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Faith Baptist tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Brethren Christian 70, Calabasas 66 -- Kevin Cooper and Franz Criego scored 17 
points to lead Brethren Christian (2-0) in a first-round game.

 Coach: Michelle Myers (third year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 19-6-1, 8-1-1 in league; after winning the South Coast League title, 
Monarchs lost to Marina, 3-1, in the Division I semifinals.

 Outlook: Bolger returns after a two-season absence to a team with much more 
talent than the one he left, but the players might take some time getting used 
to his ball-control system. Connors and Hannay, first-team all-league 
selections, and second-team picks Simpson and Delgado made up a strong nucleus. 
"It's going to be a really good team," Bolger said. "It can't help but be."

Fr.; Anne Giallonardo, midfielder, So.; Kelly Wilkins, midfielder, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Marina extended its unbeaten string to 40 games last week and the 
Vikings seem to have the team to keep it going. Campbell, The Times' county 
player of the year, and Crouch, the Division I defensive MVP, are only tips of 
the iceberg. Bruch has three other first-team all-league players and three 
second-team players at his disposal. Make that four first-teamers when Benson 
recovers from knee surgery.

GIRLS' SOCCER 1994-1995: SOCCER PREVIEW; SIX TEAMS TO WATCH; SANTA MARGARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Chuck Morales (first year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 16-6-2, 12-1-1 in the Sea View League; lost to Capistrano Valley, 
2-0, in the first round of the Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Chrissy Anderson, defender, Jr.; Ami Aylor, midfielder, So.; 
Beth Brown, defender, Sr.; Erica DeVitis, midfielder, Sr.; Kenzie Katibian, 
midfielder, Jr.; Meagan Lingo, midfielder, Jr.; Annie Luke, forward, Jr.; Erin 
McIntyre, defender, So.; Riki-Ann Serrins, goalkeeper, So.; Claire Wels,

</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Erin Beattie, defender, Jr.; Elizabeth Brooks, defender, Sr.; 
Crishon Preja, forward, So.; Kristen Rowe, forward, So. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Morales, a longtime Mission Viejo boys' club coach, inherits a loaded 
roster. DeVitis, a first-team All-Division I selection, is one of the finest 
midfielders in the county and Brown is a solid defender. Behind Brown in the 
goal is Serrins, who is keeper for the regional Olympic Development team. Rowe 
is showing a lot of promise up front. "We're not No. 1 by any means," Morales 
said. "We have a lot of work to do."

MAGELLAN TO HAVE NO DIVIDEND 
</P>

<P>
 Fidelity Investments said Monday that it will not distribute year-end 
dividends for its Magellan Fund, the largest mutual fund in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Company analysts had predicted in November that the fund would distribute 
$4.32 per share on the $37.6 billion fund, which has about 3 million 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said a calculation error is responsible for the revision and 
that it is not a reflection of the performance of the stock and bond markets, 
which have languished through much of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the normal recalculation, we uncovered an error which meant no year-end 
distribution," Fidelity spokeswoman Jane Jamieson said.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BOND WEAKNESS REINS IN STOCKS IN LATE TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Stocks ended little changed Monday as optimism generated by Friday's rally 
gave way once again to rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, among the shares performing best were those of the companies whose 
fortunes are closely tied to the economy, such as autos, heavy construction and 
mining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.70 points to 3,741.92, while in the 
broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 10 to 9 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume fell to 258.49 million shares from 284.76 million on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of any significant news to guide investors, stocks drifted 
higher for much of the day, only to be pulled down late in the session by 
weakness in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term Treasury bills plunged in value, and longer-term securities posted 
narrower losses in a lopsided selloff that markedly narrowed the difference 
between short- and long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day, the yield on the one-year Treasury bill shot up to 
7.10% -- nearly as much as the 7.81% yield on notes that don't mature for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts cautioned that the trend came in thin trading, typical of the 
post-Thanksgiving period, with fewer transactions influencing yield movements. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend was driving up rates of shorter-term maturities to what was 
described by participants as unrealistically high levels in the last month of 
this year's bond market downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's 30-year bond closed at 7.92%, up from Friday's 7.90%. Its 
price, which falls when rates rise, fell 3/16 point, or 94 cents per $1,000 in 
face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The weight of the bond market's decline -- after a spectacular rally Friday 
lifted the Dow more than 37 points -- eventually took its toll, said Hugh 
Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors don't like to see interest rates rise, because that increases 
the cost of borrowing for companies and makes shares less attractive relative 
to interest-bearing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices were depressed partly by a Commerce Department report indicating 
that sales of single-family homes rose 1.3% in October, the fourth straight 
advance as home buyers ignored the higher costs of financing. 
</P>
<P>
 That good economic news helped bolster many of the so-called cyclical stocks. 
Chrysler rose 1 1/8 to 49 7/8, Deere rose 1 1/2 to 64 1/2 and Alcoa rose 5/8 to 
82 5/8. American Electric Power Co. added 1/4 to 33, CSX gained 1 3/4 to 70 1/8 
and Bankers Trust New York was up 7/8 to 59. 
</P>
<P>
 But the strength in some sectors was offset by weakness elsewhere, including 
among retailers. Sears, Roebuck dropped 7/8 to 45 7/8 and Gap slipped 1/2 to 32 
3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * California Energy Co. said it reached a merger deal with Magma Power Co. 
giving Magma shareholders $39 a share. Magma Power rose 1 7/8 to 37 3/8; 
California Energy fell 7/8 to 15 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Video games and educational software maker Electronic Arts rose 1 3/8 to 21 
5/8 on rumors of a takeover or a major investment by a media powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer makers were strong, including Compaq Computer, which rose 3/4 to 40 
7/8, Dell Computer gained 1 1/2 to 42 5/8 and Gateway 2000 rose 1 7/8 to 22 
1/2. The computer stocks fell last week on concern about the impact from a flaw 
in Intel Corp.'s Pentium chip. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar retreated as dealers sold to lock in profits from the 
currency's gains in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 1.573 German marks, down from 1.580 on 
Friday. The greenback also was changing hands at 100.48 Japanese yen, down from 
100.61. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the rise in interest rates pounded silver futures prices to their 
lowest level in more than a year as recession fears displaced inflation 
worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver fell 11.6 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $4.573 an ounce, 
the lowest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since Nov. 30, 1993. Gold 
was unchanged at $375.50 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Copper futures also fell sharply and energy futures extended their recent 
losses, which helped push the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 
commodities down 0.82 point to 227.03. Gains in hog and corn futures tempered 
the retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mostly higher overseas. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average rose 
307.36 points to 19,305.66, while Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average was up 32.61 
points at 2,071.12. London's Financial Times 100-share average gained 16.2 
points to close at 3,033.5. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index was down 16.06 points at 2,521.42.

CATALOGUE SHOPPERS MAY FAIL AT 'PRICE TESTING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SCHOOLMAN, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not long ago, a catalogue shopper contacted a local New York television 
station, complaining that prices for the same item differed in two otherwise 
identical catalogues from the same mail-order company. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation showed that, indeed, the same item appeared in three versions 
of the Victoria's Secret catalogue, each with a different price. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Shame on You" segment on the recent WCBS-TV news program found the 
identical silk suit was $149, $169 and $189, depending on the version of the 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria's Secret, which sells lingerie, sportswear and dresses, told Reuters 
the price differences were a result of price testing, a practice it said is 
common in retailing. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Limited Inc., parent of Victoria's Secret, had "no comment on 
low set prices." 
</P>
<P>
 But the spokesman, Jonathan Basken, did take issue with "Shame on You." 
</P>
<P>
 "The local New York television program grossly misrepresented our price 
testing policy. No customer has or ever will pay a test price higher than our 
standard price," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price testing in Victoria's Secret catalogues involved "a small randomly 
selected group," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 How common is Victoria's Secret "price testing"? Catalogue experts say the 
practice, contrary to the contention of the Columbus, Ohio-based company, is 
rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've randomly spoken to eight or nine people, core to some catalogue 
businesses, and all do different things . . . price testing, maybe not, but 
maybe incentives to prospects," said Connie Heatley, senior vice president of 
the Direct Marketing Assn., a trade group for catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Catalogue marketing is relationship marketing. You may have a sale or 
clearance catalogue and may not send it out to all customers, only send to a 
certain number because of (product) availability," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While many catalogues are loath to call it "price testing," Heatley said, many 
will call price reductions on certain items "an incentive." 
</P>
<P>
 "If, for example, (a catalogue) is doing poorly in an area, they might put a 
price on products lower to encourage the sale and protect jobs and sales in an 
area," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the "Shame on You" segment, the purchase of seven items from one 
Victoria's Secret catalogue cost $623. From another, the identical items cost 
$503. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation of several of the company's catalogues showed a bra at $14 in 
one catalogue, and at $13.99 in another. Not a big price difference, but just 
enough of a psychological edge perhaps to entice a sale. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lands' End, the sportswear and outerwear mail-order company, "all pricing 
is the same in all our catalogues," said Charlotte Lacomb, manager of investor 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement agencies take allegations of duplicate pricing seriously. 
While price testing to determine what consumers will pay for an item is not 
illegal, the practice of charging more for certain customers, such as those who 
are more affluent, is a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York state attorney general's office "is reviewing this matter. . . . 
It's in very early stages of review," said Jeff Macklin, spokesman for Atty. 
Gen. G. Oliver Koppel. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the office is "determining the illegality regarding dual pricing. . . 
. I can't comment if any laws were broken with respect to pricing products and 
the like."

WORK STARTS ON ADLON HOTEL, ONCE BERLIN'S SOCIAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Work started last week to rebuild the Adlon hotel, model for the 1932 movie 
"Grand Hotel" and a luxurious stamping ground for pre-war Europe's rich and 
powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmaker Percy Adlon, great-grandson of hotelier Lorenz Adlon, came from Los 
Angeles for the groundbreaking of the hotel, whose rebirth is seen as 
symbolizing the transformation of Berlin from an isolated, divided city to a 
lively metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel is the first building being constructed on desolate Pariser Platz, 
the square facing the Brandenburg Gate that is part of the no-man's land that 
was drawn around the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Adlon, scheduled to open in 1997, is already being talked about as the 
unofficial guest house -- two presidential suites available -- for the German 
government, which is to move from Bonn to Berlin by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The $280-million construction project is financed by a closed-end real estate 
investment fund run by the Fundus Group, based in Cologne. The Adlon joins $4.5 
billion worth of construction projects in Berlin's central district, an area 
that was formerly East Berlin's sleepy center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the turn of the century, when Berlin was the capital of upward-striving 
imperial Germany, Lorenz Adlon saw the need for a super-luxury hotel. The hotel 
opened in 1907, with Kaiser Wilhelm II officiating, and quickly became the 
focus of high society and royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests included the Rockefellers, Charlie Chaplin, Thomas Mann, Indian 
maharajahs and Greta Garbo, who starred with John Barrymore in the 1932 MGM 
movie "Grand Hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel was damaged but intact when the war ended, then burned out 
completely soon after. The Allies expropriated the property from the Adlon 
family, and later Communist East Germany expropriated it again, said Percy 
Adlon, who made the movie "Baghdad Cafe."

N. IRELAND'S PEACE REQUIRES ECONOMIC RETOOLING; PLANNING: IT WILL TAKE A FINE 
BALANCE TO DISMANTLE SECTORS THAT THRIVED ON 'THE TROUBLES' OF THE PAST 25 
YEARS WHILE ATTRACTING INVESTMENT AND TOURISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, ASSOCIATED PRESS

<P>
 Near a tall wall, called the "peace line" because it was built to keep 
Catholic and Protestant neighbors from fighting, sits a factory that epitomizes 
Northern Ireland's problems and recent changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 400 workers at Mackie International's textile machinery plant are 
Protestant, although it is on the Catholic side of the fence. Protestants go 
through a separate factory gate from their Catholic co-workers, but they work 
together on the shop floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have Catholic dogs and Protestant dogs; we have Catholic cats and 
Protestant cats," says Mackie's chief executive, Patrick Dougan. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes these attitudes change. 
</P>
<P>
 As Northern Ireland lives through the early days of peace declared by 
paramilitary forces on both sides of the dispute over British rule, Dougan is 
one businessman who says reinvigorating the sickly economy is crucial to ending 
the violence for good. But it will take a fine balance to dismantle portions of 
the economy that thrived on "the troubles" of the past 25 years while 
attracting investment and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One problem is Northern Ireland's disproportionate number of state employees, 
notably police. About one in three workers are in the public sector, while just 
one in six is employed in manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 With peace, Northern Ireland might trim a well-paid, 20,000-member security 
force made up of police officers, prison officials and locally recruited 
British soldiers known as the Royal Irish Regiment. 
</P>
<P>
 About 14,000 of those jobs can be expected to vanish within five years, with 
fallout eliminating 6,000 more jobs, according to Graham Gudgin, director of 
the Northern Ireland Economic Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Even jobs in private industry would be lost. Likely economic victims of peace 
would be companies that repair bombed-out windows, or dealers who sell security 
devices that people have used to keep gunmen from crashing in at night. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gudgin believes tourism could double over the next five years, adding 
10,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now in the realm of speculation, but we might gain another 2,000 jobs a 
year through inward investment," Gudgin said. "In about five years, we might 
break even. The problem is, the people losing jobs won't be the ones getting 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 If job loss outpaces job creation, the fragile economy could weaken further. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The troubles have been economically as well as socially and politically 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
 The Confederation of British Industry says up to 40,000 jobs were lost as the 
violence escalated in the early 1970s, compounding problems from a general 
deterioration of heavy industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Inward investment slowed dramatically, although some companies moved in. 
Before the cease-fires, Hilton said it would put a hotel in a downtown 
development, giving Northern Ireland's business community a psychological lift. 
</P>
<P>
 And Belfast's Europa Hotel, bombed about 30 times since the early 1970s, has 
undergone a dramatic refurbishment to bring itself up to international 
four-star standards. 
</P>
<P>
 British Prime Minister John Major chose a Northern Ireland executives lunch at 
the Europa to announce Oct. 21 he would assume the Irish Republican Army's 
truce was intended to be permanent. This ended weeks of British government 
insistence that the Catholic-based paramilitary group spell out its intentions 
more specifically. 
</P>
<P>
 Major was saying peace will help the economy. But business leaders are leery 
of being too optimistic, knowing that many international investors never even 
think of Northern Ireland as a plant location. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'You're like Beirut,' " said Stan Mallon, an executive director at 
the Industrial Development Board. "A businessman doesn't want to invest in a 
country plagued with violence. We say that perception is not correct." 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, visitors might have their doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 Armored military vehicles patrol the streets, as do soldiers toting submachine 
guns. Moving from one Catholic area to a neighboring Protestant district, a 
metal barricade blocks traffic so soldiers can punch each license plate number 
into a central computer. Assuming the car is not stolen or owned by certain 
paramilitary figures, the barricade is electronically moved out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Mackie's factory has a Catholic gate and a Protestant gate, some parts 
of town have segregated taxi services that ferry people only from their own 
areas to "neutral" turf. The threat of sectarian assassination has underpinned 
work for many of the more than 100 taxi firms in Belfast alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment remains chronic in Northern Ireland, where 12.8% of the work 
force has no job. The British average is 9.1%.  
</P>
<P>
 Catholic men remain about 2 1/2 times as likely as Protestant men to be 
unemployed. Discrimination by Protestant employers was a main root of the 
troubles when Catholics campaigned for civil rights in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The imbalance is eroding, in part because the collapse of traditional 
industries dominated by Protestants has pushed up unemployment in that 
community. But at some factories, a "chill factor" in the form of harassment 
and threats deters Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mackie, once a bastion of Northern Ireland Protestantism, Dougan hopes to 
exemplify a better way. 
</P>
<P>
 A Catholic who left Northern Ireland in his youth for fear of job 
discrimination, Dougan began a successful career in the auto industry of the 
British Midlands. 
</P>
<P>
 He took control of Mackie in 1991 by assuming debts of its bankrupt owners. 
Since then, the proportion of Catholics at Mackie has risen from 11% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 This shows the two sides can set aside their differences and work together, 
Dougan says. It remains to be seen whether investors agree.

KODAK CHAIRMAN STRUGGLES TO DEVELOP EFFICIENCY; CORPORATIONS: GEORGE FISHER 
BATTLES COMPETITION PROBLEMS, WASTEFUL PRODUCTION AND RIGID MANAGEMENT WITH 
LAYOFFS. BUT MORE MUST BE DONE, ANALYSTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEN DOBBIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steadying Eastman Kodak Co., the wobbly giant of photography, is turning out 
to be trickier than George Fisher imagined when he became chairman a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Stymied by Kodak's longstanding failure to control costs, Fisher, the former 
chief executive of Motorola Inc., recently sanctioned a new round of job cuts, 
an expediency he had hoped to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after a half-dozen overhauls since 1983, the world's largest imaging 
company -- unlike many of America's corporate icons -- still hadn't shaken off 
enough excess weight to outrun a burst of global competition. 
</P>
<P>
 So Fisher responded in quick succession this fall with a hiring freeze, cuts 
in research spending and speedy layoffs. Investors and analysts who had called 
repeatedly for an improvement in Kodak's perennially flat profits were pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's sharpen that scalpel!" said Morgan Stanley analyst Brenda Lee Landry. 
"This company built up layers of fat over how many years. There's still plenty 
to get out." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was decidedly more somber in Kodak Park, the 2,200-acre manufacturing 
nucleus a mile north of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of scared people here and a lot of depression. It's happened 
one too many times," said a dispirited Lori Pacific, who could be among 800 
administrative employees being axed early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting to the point where I don't know if I care or not," said Pacific, 
47, a single parent who joined Kodak 18 years ago. "Business is business, and 
they're going to do whatever they have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a model of blue-chip prosperity, Kodak's near-monopoly on U.S. film 
sales, dating to the turn of the century under founder George Eastman, has 
tumbled since the 1970s to an estimated 67%. Worldwide, its market share is 
around 45%. 
</P>
<P>
 While it remains consistently profitable, cutthroat competition from Japan's 
Fuji and generic-label manufacturers has curbed Kodak's ability to raise 
prices. And wasteful production methods and a management that is rigid and 
inbred have hobbled its entry into new markets. 
</P>
<P>
 A surge in electronic imaging presents a growing danger that Kodak's 
chemical-based technology -- its cash cow -- could become obsolete. Profits 
from its digital business, however, are still five years away, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The company tried to adapt to vigorous foreign competition by diversifying 
into health care in the 1980s but succeeded only in shrinking its profits and 
racking up $10.5 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after chief executive Kay Whitmore was fired in August, 1993, for 
failing to cut deep enough into costs, the company said it would cut 10,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Fisher, who officially took over Dec. 1, 1993, is being forced down the 
same gangplank. 
</P>
<P>
 He quickly auctioned off Sterling Winthrop and nearly all non-photographic 
subsidiaries for $7.9 billion -- a $1 billion-plus net gain that Kodak will use 
to invest in new products, alliances with leading electronics companies and 
fast-growing markets in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 But poor financial results in October were a grim reminder that returning to 
the business it knows best won't eradicate old failings. While sales rose 12% 
to $3.5 billion in the third quarter, costs jumped 21%. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Fisher's response was swift: He initiated unit-by-unit cutbacks to 
shape up Kodak's bottom line by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak's most vocal critic on Wall Street, B. Alex Henderson of Prudential 
Securities, raised his rating of the company's stock from "hold" to "buy" and 
predicted between 2,000 and 4,000 layoffs within the next year. From a peak 
employment of 145,300 in 1988, Kodak soon will have fewer 85,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Henderson doesn't think long-term prospects look bright. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry is confronted with increasing competition, eroding demographics, 
challenges from camcorders," he said. "Fisher's going to have to cut costs 
fairly aggressively not just now but ad infinitum to maintain profitability and 
cash flow." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are willing to bet that Fisher, through innovative products and 
alliances, better use of brand marketing and a willingness to clamp down on 
sloppy operations, can reinvigorate Kodak without gutting its work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to hurt morale, you want to build up a fighting spirit," 
analyst Landry said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, she cautioned, "some problems might be deeper than he 
thinks. The Kodak culture could fool an outsider. I wouldn't rule out some more 
changes at the top." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's certainly the best guy the company could have hired to do the job," said 
Nicholas Heymann of NatWest Securities, who believes the crux will be Fisher's 
ability "to create a dynamic, totally flexible environment that will transform 
the way the business is run."

CONSULTANT USES MUSIC TO HELP FOSTER PRODUCTIVITY AND HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget easy listening or plain silence. If you're on hold at Acclivus Corp., 
you'll get an earful of Mozart or Bach, and, theoretically, come back on the 
line a little bit happier -- and maybe smarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas-based consulting firm started putting classical music on its phone 
lines about two years ago. The tip came via New Age "music healer" Don Campbell 
of Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Acclivus, which conducts corporate workshops on improving workplace 
learning and efficiency, instructors now play music between classes and during 
reading periods, also on Campbell's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a lack of hard data, Acclivus President Randall Murphy says music has 
made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know it is a trend anecdotally," Murphy said. "People have more energy 
late in the afternoon where workshops are supported by music than not." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not background music, said the chief executive, such as that piped 
into supermarkets and malls to lull people into buying. By contrast, he said, 
Campbell uses music to stimulate. 
</P>
<P>
 A classically trained musician, Campbell, 47, had a busy career from the 1960s 
to the 1980s as an organist at an Episcopal cathedral in Haiti, music critic 
for a newspaper in Tokyo, choirmaster and conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982 he developed a lump in his chest from a degenerative bone disease. He 
cured himself by toning, which is like humming, he said, for 35 hours straight. 
"I call it my nervous breakthrough," he told Reuters in the fall, at a sound 
healers' conference in Epping, N.H. "It was one of those startling moments when 
I surrendered to sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Now at his Institute for Music, Health and Education in Boulder, Campbell 
teaches others how tones and songs affect mood and learning ability. He charges 
$350 a weekend or $1,950 for a 15-day seminar on "The Power of Sound." 
</P>
<P>
 He takes his message into Fortune 500 companies, such as International 
Business Machines, working with individual employees on their breathing, the 
octaves at which they speak (lower is more soothing), delivery and the 
"psychoacoustics" of the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 When Campbell goes to a company, he analyzes the environment to determine how 
sound or music can make workers more productive and less stressed. Speaking 
from Boulder, he said he might suggest music in various forms, either through 
headphones for an individual, or piped in to a particular room or department.

ARCHITECTURE: WHAT'S GOING UP IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN GAMES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Stephen Games is a former architecture 
correspondent for the Guardian in Britain. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Little is known in this country about contemporary Mexican architecture. Apart 
from monographs on Luis Barragan, who died in 1988, Ricardo Legorreta, who 
recently rebuilt Pershing Square, and Abraham Zabludovsky, there are almost no 
books on the subject. An exhibition through Sunday at Cal State Fullerton 
apparently is only the third in the United States to look at what Mexican 
architects are doing south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is this, and is the deficiency Mexico's or our own? In a country where 
building has had to keep pace with a 73% increase in population in the past 20 
years, there isn't a shortage of new projects in Mexico to write about. The 
absence of information suggests a lack of excellence, or that we are shamefully 
ignorant of it. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the starting point for "Myth and Modernism in Mexican Architecture," 
curated by graduate students Karen Collins and Pollyanna Nordstrand. It looks 
at 10 of Mexico's leading architects and tries to explain something of their 
thinking; through it we can learn why North and Central America fail to engage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico shares the dilemma of every foreign country in the 20th Century: how to 
handle the fact that it's not the United States. In architecture, this has led 
to a duality. Some architects want to be part of global currents; others want 
to say something specifically Mexican. Between the two positions, there is 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Zabludovsky, for example, creates scaleless abstract works with huge concrete 
slabs and powerful diagonals. His aesthetic and the way he talks about it 
belong to mainstream U.S. commercial architecture of the 1970s. Some, however, 
see in it a fundamental Mexican heaviness that echoes the work of Le Corbusier 
(for whom his former partner, Teodoro Gonzalez de Leon, once worked) but that 
finds a niche in the land of the Aztec pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 Agustin Hernandez, by contrast, is a passionate advocate of pre-Hispanic art. 
He often uses Indian motifs as a starting point for his designs and believes in 
the search for national identity. But this is not apparent from his work. His 
daring, futuristic buildings could be settings for sci-fi movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition is intrigued by this ambivalence. The curators, who are not 
architects, are sympathetic to the idea of an authentic Mexican architecture -- 
the "Myth" of the exhibition's title -- and have gone looking for it among 
Mexico's most worldly and sophisticated architects. Their conclusion is that it 
doesn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 What does exist is a large body of conventional, modern buildings by a 
relatively elderly architectural establishment. The two younger architects in 
the show, Enrique Norten and Alberto Kalach, have more stylistic pizazz but 
also relate more to international trends than to national influences. Their 
stage is New York, Barcelona and Milan, not Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins and Nordstrand elaborate on this. Mexico's adoption of modern 
architecture in the 1920s, they observe, was linked to the social reforms that 
followed the 1910 Revolution. The idea was that architects would build a modern 
society by building a modern architecture. Few now believe this, yet Mexico's 
architects remain loyal to the modernist aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
 An accompanying essay by Mexican architectural critic Louise Noelle explains 
this loyalty in terms of the work it has produced. Noelle sees three post-'60s 
tendencies -- Brutalism, Futurism and Cubism by any other name -- contributing 
to a rich mix of Mexican architecture. Twenty years ago, that would have been 
something to boast about. 
</P>
<P>
 An American looking at the exhibit might complain that Mexican architecture is 
dragging its feet. That's partly because we have grown used to exhibitions and 
publications that only deal with innovation. Historian Shelly Kappe, who 
curated the first show of Mexican architecture (in 1981), says all serious 
architects, not just those in Mexico, have been suppressed in the past 15 years 
in favor of the merely fashionable. The show at Fullerton is in fact very like 
hers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Collins and Nordstrand have underplayed the latest trends in Mexican 
architecture. An exhibition that focused on the next generation would have made 
Mexico look more exciting, or at least more competitive. The studios called TAX 
(Taller de Arquitectura X) and TEN (Taller de Enrique Norten), only touched on 
in Fullerton, do well alongside the chic historicists and deconstructivists of 
Europe and America. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In neglecting them, the curators may have been ill-advised by the established 
figures whom they visited in Mexico City in June, but this itself is revealing. 
For 65 years, Mexico has been run by the same political party, giving rise to 
old-boy networks and inevitable stagnation. The absence of new faces from this 
exhibition bears out the perceived conservatism of Mexican architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 There are different ways of viewing this. While Kappe welcomes the survival of 
Mexico's long-term players, USC professor John Mutlow, now writing a book on 
the New Architecture of Mexico for Rizzoli, sees it as partly retrograde. His 
book excludes two older exhibitors in the Fullerton show, Alejandro Zohn and 
Enrique Murillo, for not deserving the national honors they have won. 
</P>
<P>
 He further points to rote teaching at Mexico's overpopulated architecture 
schools and the conformity that this produces among students. He cites the lack 
of advanced materials and building techniques found abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican architecture is still pre-industrial, he says. Agustin Landa and 
Carlos Mijares use brick vaulting where U.S. architects would roof in steel. 
Norten's perforated metal sheeting has to be perforated by hand. Armies of 
laborers use chisels instead of jackhammers to provide Zabludovsky with his 
trademark rough concrete surfaces. Even the modernism of Mexico is imitative. 
</P>
<P>
 America does not look to Mexico for new architecture -- perhaps because, as 
Mexico's Nobel Prize-winning writer and critic Octavio Paz has suggested, 
America doesn't think it can learn from a country that didn't see the point of 
the New World. Mexico is equally conflicted. Many countries regard the concept 
of "progress" as interchangeable with "Americanization." For Mexico in 
particular, this makes it a mixed blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins and Nordstrand miss out on one other area of architectural interest. 
"I hate to say this," says Norberto Nardi, an Italian-Argentinian architect 
whose course in Latin American architecture at Cal Poly Pomona is the only one 
of its kind in the U.S., "but developers appear to be the best interpreters of 
public taste. They've realized that the Mediterranean style is very popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Architects may not take this seriously, but the public does. And that, after 
all, has been the story of architecture in the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican architecture also has dramatic appeal, notes Nardi, whose book 
"Bridging the New World" will be appearing next year. "Mexican architecture is 
in many ways still about Spanish and pre-Columbian grandeur," he says. "It's 
big; it uses expensive natural materials and has spectacular finishes." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Mexico's achievements possible, Nardi writes, are its low labor 
costs, the extraordinarily skillful artisans and the lax (and sometimes 
corrupt) building codes, which also enhance its sculptural possibilities. 
Barragan's famous cantilevered staircase without a handrail never would have 
been allowed in the U.S., says Nardi, adding: "Public safety can be 
asphyxiating." 
</P>
<P>
 The show at Fullerton was meant primarily as a student exercise in exhibition 
design. It deserves credit for this and for surviving the headaches of 
shipping. Its very success, however, gives it a public voice. This is 
significant. As exhibition design grows into an independent profession, its 
purpose becomes cloudier. However neutral it may try to be, an exhibition 
always offers a point of view. It is important that curators work with people 
who really know their field and understand the impact of what they include or 
omit. 
</P>

NOTEBOOK; BREA COACH SAYS HE TRIED TO CALL OFF HIS LADYCATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First-year Brea-Olinda girls' basketball Coach Jeff Sink found himself 
immersed in controversy after his first game last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats, four-time defending State champions who finished No. 1 in USA 
Today's national poll, opened the season with an eye-popping 137-10 victory 
over Ontario Chaffey last week. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a 127-point margin of victory, and accusations running up the score 
were flying as quickly as a Nicole Erickson pass. But that wasn't the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Sink called off the press seven minutes into the game and played all 13 of his 
players -- including his junior varsity players. All scored; the Ladycats shot 
56% from the field -- mostly from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the press off . . . and they pushed the ball back at us and handed it 
to us and we would go the other way," Sink said the day after. "I'm not like 
that; it bothered me. I called (Chaffey Coach Rudy Figeroa) and he was a 
gentleman; he said 'No problem, you could have scored 200 if you wanted to.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never let that happen again. In hindsight, we could have passed the 
ball 10 times before shooting, but there's one school of thought that says 
that's more humiliating because it's obvious you're not trying to score. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I was not trying to do was run it up. It was an obvious 
mismatch." 
</P>
<P>
 The next , Brea beat Upland, 94-26, to set the county record for consecutive 
victories at 56; 12 players scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats won the tournament by beating Lynwood, 57-32, their 58th 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no telling how much longer the current winning streak will last; in 
this week's Ladycat Classic, Sink scheduled Brea with the toughest road to the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Our) half of the bracket is loaded," Sink said. "Here at Brea, I think you 
play for CIF and State (titles) and everything else is just preparation." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Created in 1990, the Bob Woods Trophy -- named after the former Mater Dei head 
coach and Bishop Amat assistant coach -- went to the winner of the football 
game between Angelus League rivals Mater Dei and Bishop Amat. The teams played 
twice before the league was disbanded and the trophy has been in Mater Dei 
Coach Bruce Rollinson's office since. However, the trophy will be on the line 
-- along with the Southern Section championship -- in Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In case you didn't know, Trabuco Hills outgained La Puente Bishop Amat, 287 
yards to 286, in the Mustangs' 49-22 loss in the Division I semifinal. . . . 
Servite got four sacks against El Toro in the Division V semifinal; Newport

13 FELINE HEIRS BELIEVED KILLED IN HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neighbors called it the Cat House -- a three-bedroom home where the only 
residents for more than a year were the 13 well-tended cats whose owner left 
the house to them in her will before she died in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 All the pets were believed dead after a weekend fire that caused more than 
$100,000 damage to the otherwise unoccupied home. Fire officials said Monday 
that investigators had not yet determined the cause of the blaze, which broke 
out about 9:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of 10 of the cats were recovered shortly after the fire. Another 
cat -- Lucy -- was discovered dead Monday, according to people who tended the 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm completely out of my mind," said Doris Duewiger, who drove from her home 
in Long Beach twice a week to feed and clean up after the cats after their 
owner, Rachel Whitten, died in August, 1993. "They were always there for love. 
They'd get up on the counter by the sink, and I went down the line, calling 
each one by name and saying, 'I love you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Whitten lived alone with her pets and left the house to them in her will, 
Duewiger said. A longtime friend of Whitten and a cat lover, Duewiger said she 
was appointed in the will to care for the pets. She has gotten help from a 
neighbor of the Whitten home who feeds the cats daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,100-square-foot house in the 7800 block of Ruthann Avenue was fully 
furnished, its lawn clipped by a gardener every two weeks. Three air 
conditioners ran nonstop during the summer to keep the cats cool. A radio was 
left on constantly to keep them company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's that strange," said Gene Rice, whose wife, Benita, made 
twice-daily visits to the house to refill the food and water dishes and air out 
the house. "I've seen a lot of other strange things around the neighborhood 
other than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice said Whitten was reclusive but known by neighbors to be a cat fancier. 
After her death, Rice said, he found a mountain of cat litter scattered around 
the back yard. "There's got to be a ton of it or two out there. Or three," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice said his wife and Duewiger had sought to place the animals in new homes 
after Whitten's death but did not get responses from the attorney handling the 
estate. The caretakers thought the felines, though friendly and well looked 
after, were isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 They were "lonely because there wasn't anybody there all day long," said 
Duewiger. 
</P>
<P>
 Duewiger said she was at the house about six hours before the fire was 
reported and noticed nothing unusual. She said the only appliance on was the 
radio. Though fire officials had drawn no conclusions, Duewiger said tearfully 
that she suspects the fire was deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have broken in and taken anything they wanted to -- just leave the 
kitties alone," Duewiger said.

NATIONAL GUARD ARMORIES OFFER SHELTER FOR THE HOMELESS; EMERGENCY: SANTA ANA, 
FULLERTON FACILITIES WILL BE OPEN NEARLY EVERY NIGHT FOR NEXT THREE MONTHS. 
EACH CAN ACCOMMODATE UP TO 135 PEOPLE DURING WINTER. O.C. HOMELESS ARE 
ESTIMATED AT UP TO 15,000.

 With nighttime temperatures dipping into the 40s, National Guard armories in 
Santa Ana and Fullerton opened their doors to some of Orange County's homeless 
Monday night, housing as many as 270 men, women and children under the annual 
cold weather emergency shelter program. 
</P>
<P>
 With cots, warm blankets, free flu shots and tuberculosis and HIV testing 
kits, organizers are trying to improve conditions for some of the county's 
estimated 12,000 to 15,000 homeless as the winter weather grows colder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the armory as a health and safety issue," said Maria Mendoza, the 
county's homeless issues coordinator. "We help get people off the streets when 
they could die out in the cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every night for the next three months, the two military training 
facilities, each of which is about the size of a high school gymnasium, will be 
transformed into safe havens where hot meals prepared by Theo Lacy Branch Jail 
inmates and staff will be offered. The shelters, which can hold as many as 135 
people each, are expected to be full every night. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of armories to temporarily house California's homeless during bad 
weather months began seven years ago, when then-Gov. George Deukmejian 
initiated the Emergency Shelter Program, which included Orange County as part 
of a pilot project. 
</P>
<P>
 Under previous regulations, armories opened when temperatures dropped to 40 
degrees, or to 50 degrees when it was raining or precipitation was forecast.  
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures this week are expected to dip into the 60s during the day and 40s 
at night. Slightly warmer temperatures are expected by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said both armories will close on Friday if temperatures increase by 
then. Unless there is another cold snap, they will remain closed until Dec. 15, 
when the law mandates that they open and remain open through March 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The armories close to the homeless when the National Guard must use the 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the homeless say they appreciate the program, but they caution 
that the temporary shelters should not be seen as a remedy for the county's 
homelessness problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all sleep a little better in the winter months when we know the armories 
are there," said Tim Shaw, executive director of the Orange County Homeless 
Issues Task Force, a county-funded organization. "The armory is a cold weather 
shelter. It's like window-dressing the solution to homelessness. It's not the 
best use of funds. It's . . . a place of last resort. We need that, especially 
in cold weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Buses sponsored by the emergency program will pick up the homeless at central 
points such as the Santa Ana Civic Center and Pearson Park in Fullerton, 
reducing the crowds of people seeking aid at local missions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The armories come in very handy," said Jeff Nickels, assistant program 
manager at the Rescue Mission in Santa Ana. "There are nights when there are up 
to 60 people we can't accommodate. It's small Band-Aid work, but we appreciate 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 By 7 a.m., the armories return to military use. Shelter residents are bused 
back to pickup points. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of neighborhoods where the armories are located have complained in 
the past that shelters often draw homeless people into their communities. But 
Mendoza argued that the program's bus system prevents crowds of people from 
congregating around the armories. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1993 survey conducted by the Homeless Issues Task Force, analysts found 
that the needy come from all parts of Orange County, including affluent cities 
such as Newport Beach, Irvine and Mission Viejo.  
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County people tend to think homeless people are coming from somewhere 
else and that they're not from here," Shaw said. "But the reality is that they 
are. Homelessness is a local problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the early blast of cold weather, and what homeless advocates say is 
an increased homeless population this winter, organizers predict greater 
attendance at the armories this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is we are going to have a worse winter this year. Once it turns 
cold and rainy, we go over capacity," said Jim Miller, director of Shelter for 
the Homeless, the nonprofit agency that contracts with the county to run the 
shelter program. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers are trying to bolster the effectiveness of this year's $260,000 
program by linking up shelter residents with long-term transitional housing. 
Questionnaires will be distributed to assess the needs of the homeless. The 
data will be sent to federal and state agencies in an effort to improve social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter for the Homeless also will screen people entering the armory for 
referral to a newly created program, in which 12 churches will house single men 
and women for 45 to 60 days of counseling and job training. 
</P>
<P>
 If they complete that program, they become eligible for Shelter for the 
Homeless' transitional housing program, where they can live for as long as a 
year in homes owned by the agency.  
</P>
<P>
 "People on the streets are survivors," Mendoza said. "It's not as though they 
don't want to help themselves. But they've made poor decisions all their lives. 
We've sort of crippled them by assisting them with only emergency care. Unless 
we are there as a support, they are not going to be successful."  
</P>
<P>
 The National Armory in Santa Ana is at 612 E. Warner Ave. The Fullerton 
facility is at 400 S. Brookhurst St. For information, call Shelter for the 
Homeless at (714) 879-3221.

RILEY JOINS CALL FOR JAIL SITE STUDY; CORRECTIONS: TWO SUPERVISORS URGE REVIEW 
OF WHETHER TO MOVE MUSICK FACILITY TO EL TORO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just days after publicly blasting a proposal by County Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton to relocate the James A. Musick Branch Jail from Irvine to the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station, Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley joined Stanton on 
Monday in urging his colleagues to authorize a study of the proposed move. 
</P>
<P>
 The authorization is expected to be considered by the Board of Supervisors 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said his statement last week criticizing Stanton's proposal and 
reiterating that any new jail facility ought to be built in Santa Ana "was an 
off-the-cuff remark." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that subsequent conversations with Stanton and other county officials 
convinced him of the need to study the relocation idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those things that happens every once in a while in 
communications," Riley said, adding that last week's comments were prompted in 
part by his irritation at not being consulted in advance regarding Stanton's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley's 5th District includes the Musick facility, while Stanton's 1st 
District includes Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Kiff, Riley's executive assistant, explained that the supervisor 
"supports making the study. If you asked him, 'Do you support moving the Musick 
facility to the base?' he's not ready to say yes or no on that. But he supports 
the idea of studying it," despite the fact that he "still believes that Santa 
Ana remains a viable site." 
</P>
<P>
 A two-page letter appearing over Riley's and Stanton's signatures urges the 
board, among other things, to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Direct the county administrative office to prepare an application to the 
federal government for acquisition of approximately 300 acres of the El Toro 
base site for possible relocation of the Musick jail. The base is expected to 
close by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorize a study on the feasibility of such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 * Direct the General Services Agency to assess the value of the 100-acre 
Musick jail site for possible sale. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Challenges require the best of innovation and creativity that is available," 
the letter reads in part. "Over the last decade, Orange County has stepped up 
to the challenge of meeting our major infrastructure needs. . . . Part of that 
infrastructure includes jails. This proposal will move the county forward in a 
proactive, achievable and cost-effective manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton's proposal calls for shutting down and selling the Musick jail -- a 
minimum-security facility equipped to house 1,256 inmates in Irvine -- and 
using the proceeds to construct a jail facility on part of the 4,700-acre 
Marine base. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the federal government encourages local governments to use part of 
closed bases for jail facilities, the county might be able to get the El Toro 
property for free, county officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 The relocation of the Musick facility, Stanton has said, not only would give 
the county a facility in a remote area, but would also allow a residential 
community in Lake Forest, which is adjacent to the Irvine facility, to get rid 
of a jail and the problems associated with it. 
</P>
<P>
 If authorized, Kiff said, the feasibility study should be completed within 45 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates had not yet had time to consider the 
proposal, a spokesman for Gates said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says he just recently received some input regarding (it) and has not yet 
had time to come to any conclusion," Lt. Dan Martini said. "He certainly would 
like to analyze the information before" commenting.

GIRL, 12, DESCRIBES FATAL CRASH AT DOCTOR'S TRIAL; COURTS: KARIE MINZEY TELLS 
OF COLLISION THAT KILLED HER PARENTS AND INJURED HER, TWO OTHERS. PHYSICIAN IS 
ACCUSED OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A giggly 12-year-old schoolgirl silenced a courtroom Monday when she smiled 
and insisted that she doesn't hate anyone -- not even the doctor who was high 
on drugs and alcohol when he caused a car crash that killed her parents and 
left her disfigured. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Orange County Superior Court jurors appeared to blink back tears 
as Karie Minzey testified on the first day of a trial for Ronald Allen, who is 
accused of second-degree murder and other charges stemming from the July, 1993, 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a purple plaid skirt and sporting short blonde hair that framed her 
distorted face, the girl remained chipper even when recalling the crash that 
killed her parents, Noreen and Mark Minzey. 
</P>
<P>
 When Assistant Public Defender Michael P. Giannini asked Karie whether she is 
always happy, she replied, "Yes, I am." While Allen clasped his hands and 
appeared on the verge of tears, the attorney then asked the girl whether she 
hated anyone in the courtroom. "No," she quickly responded. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minzeys and two other passengers were driving home from a softball game on 
July 11, 1993, when the Laguna Beach physician swerved across the solid yellow 
lines on Santiago Canyon Road outside the Orange city limit and hit the 
Minzeys' car head-on. The other passengers were also injured. All of the 
victims were wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged Allen with murder because of his history of driving while 
intoxicated. But Allen's defense attorney contends his client turned to drugs 
and alcohol because he suffers from clinical depression and was devastated by 
his father's death hours before the crash. The defense says he should be 
convicted of vehicular manslaughter.  
</P>
<P>
 In her first public comments, Karie charmed jurors along with the courtroom 
audience as she punctuated her sentences with a girlish laugh but also spoke 
with a sophistication beyond her years. 
</P>
<P>
 She suffered a broken left knee and right wrist, but the most serious injuries 
were to her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sunk in," Karie said, shrugging, as she described the injuries to her 
left eye socket and cheekbone. 
</P>
<P>
 While she was in a coma, doctors shaved her head and removed nearly the entire 
left side of her skull to relieve pressure on her swollen brain. She said she 
didn't realize the extent of her injuries "until I looked in a mirror and my 
hair was shaved off and half my skull was taken out." She told jurors that she 
had to learn to walk again. 
</P>
<P>
 Karie squirmed in her seat when the prosecutor asked about her grades. "Do I 
have to say?" she said to courtroom laughter. "As, Bs and maybe one or two Cs." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl told jurors her family and friends were on their way home after 
celebrating a softball victory -- a victory sealed by Minzey, although she was 
modest in acknowledging it: "I guess you could call the triple I hit the 
winning hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Karie's prognosis is unclear. She has regained mobility in her legs, but must 
undergo further operations. The removed portion of her skull was frozen and 
later replaced, but it has not healed properly and has left a large sunken spot 
on the left rear side of her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Allen, 32, studied the effects of drugs and alcohol in medical 
school and had been stopped for driving intoxicated on three prior occasions, 
two involving crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Robert Molko told jurors Allen was driving recklessly on the day of 
the crash, using left-turn pockets to speed ahead of traffic. Blood tests show 
Allen had taken five different drugs and alcohol before the fatal crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "He willingly decided to take the drugs and alcohol knowing he would have to 
drive," Molko told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense said Monday that Allen was suffering from clinical depression, 
work stress and financial problems. The internist who had dedicated himself to 
treating AIDS patients broke down and sobbed uncontrollably during Giannini's 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding Allen's grief, Giannini said, was Allen's lie a day before the 
fatal accident, when he claimed his father was suffering from heart trouble and 
asked a co-worker to cover for him on his rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how the Greek gods do these things . . . but exactly what Ron 
said came true," Giannini told jurors.

TOXIC REFUGEES FIND A HOME; U.S. PAYS RENT FOR 45 FAMILIES UNTIL WASTE SLUDGE 
IS REMOVED 
</P>

 Gloria Delzeith has a lot of extra time on her hands these days. 
</P>
<P>
 A maid comes each afternoon to vacuum her carpets, make the beds, change the 
towels, mop the floors, scrub the sinks, do the dishes, scour the bathtubs, 
restock the shampoo and refill the candy bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospitality room near her two-bedroom suite provides free breakfasts and 
light dinners as well as unlimited beer and daily newspapers. And to make sure 
that her family is completely comfortable, housekeepers change the curtains in 
her unit at least once a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing left to do," said Delzeith, 52. "In the beginning it was kind 
of strange. Now I'm used to it; I learned to make an afghan." 
</P>
<P>
 The best part, though, is that the tab for this $90-a-day hotel suite is paid 
by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Delzeith, her husband, two grown sons, two dogs and a cat are among nine 
families being put up at the Marriott Residence Inn for up to six months while 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency removes hazardous waste from their 
Westminster neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 12 families are staying in houses renting for $1,200 to $1,800 a 
month. And before the project is completed late next year, said project manager 
Dick Vesperman, 45 families will have been temporarily relocated at a cost to 
taxpayers of up to $1 million -- currently being doled out at a rate of about 
$75,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at a number of alternatives, and this is by far the most 
cost-effective," said Vesperman, noting that decisions on where each family 
stays are made jointly by the family and EPA interviewers based on individual 
family needs and budgetary considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 While the government probably could have found less expensive lodgings, he 
said, it decided on the extended-stay hotel facilities and rented homes rather 
than more conventional motel or hotel accommodations because of the long stays, 
expected to range from several weeks to more than six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fine to stay in a hotel for a few days," Vesperman said, but staying 
somewhere for long periods of time is a different matter entirely. "Leaving 
your home for six months can be a very emotionally uprooting experience. We 
wanted to ease the trauma that some families experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of that trauma were sown in 1936 when, according to historical 
records gathered by the EPA, the Long Beach-based Ralph Gray Trucking Co. 
dumped about 45,000 cubic yards of petroleum waste into four open pits in a 
field the company owned near Sowell Avenue and Golden West Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a developer intent on building a housing tract unmarred by the 
unsightly pits moved the hazardous material a few hundred yards away into two 
trenches, where it was buried 18 feet beneath the back yards of 25 of the homes 
he was building. Years later, the homes' occupants began noticing a strange 
black goo seeping up through their back-yard lawns and patio cracks each summer 
when the weather got hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Exuding a powerful stench, the ooze caused coughing, headaches, sleeplessness, 
chest pains, nausea and breathing difficulties. One resident even blamed it for 
the loss of a lung and regular bouts of serious asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray is long dead, federal officials said, and neither the trucking company 
nor the tract developer is still in business. Two years ago, the neighborhood 
-- considered one of the worst hazardous waste sites in the United States -- 
was added to the national priority list of Superfund sites, thus qualifying for 
a federally funded cleanup. And last summer, workers embarked on a two-year, 
$16.1-million project during which bulldozer operators wearing respirators are 
tearing up back yards and swimming pools to remove the toxic substance. 
</P>
<P>
 The pools, patios, fences and room additions will later be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the 45 affected families -- including the Delzeiths -- moved out 
in late August. Most of them are expected to return to their homes by 
mid-January, just in time to be replaced by a second wave of evacuees whose 
back yards will be dug up next spring and summer. With the affected homes 
forming a T-shape on two intersecting streets, the entire tract covers about 
six city blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the toxic refugees say they are adjusting well to their new 
environs, the extended relocation is particularly hard on families with small 
children. This is especially true during the holidays, some say. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the difficulties, one family was moved into a single-family 
dwelling after spending several weeks at the Marriott Residence Inn. The 
members of another family currently staying at the inn say they are coping as 
well as they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss my house," said Maria Le, 32, who has been sharing a two-bedroom suite 
at the inn with her husband and three young children since mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major problems, she said, has been the sleeping arrangements. 
Rather than crowd all three children into one bed, she and her husband are 
sharing their bed with one of them. On the plus side, she noted, the EPA pays 
for a driver to take her 6-year-old to school each day. But with Christmas fast 
approaching, Le said she is having a hard time envisioning how to properly 
celebrate the holiday at a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be tough," she said. "I can't put up decorations" because of 
insufficient space. "Normally, we have the family over, but this year I don't 
think we'll be able to do it. And I'm planning to buy toys, but I keep putting 
it off because I have no place to hide them." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the affected families, however, the forced dislocation seems akin 
to an all-expense-paid extended vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the majority moved into completely furnished two-bedroom units with 
kitchens, they generally left their furniture and appliances at home. Included 
in their hotel suites are ovens, toasters, microwaves, coffee makers (with 
coffee provided daily), living-room television sets with VCRs and additional 
TVs in each bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The government provides each family with a $100-a-month "dislocation 
allowance" to help pay for such incidentals as use of the hotel laundry, phone 
calls and extra gasoline for daily treks to the post office. Although they may 
visit their homes by making special appointments in advance, few inn-dwellers 
ever bother to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, while workers wearing white coveralls and breathing masks toil six 
miles away spraying their back yards with odor-eating mists, the Westminster 
residents gather in the hotel lobby every day for a 5 p.m. social hour during 
which they hobnob with friends, drink unlimited amounts of free beer and wine 
and consume free popcorn, tacos, lasagna, spaghetti, chicken pot pies, baked 
potatoes, soup, salads and turkey sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's making us closer," Ralph Johnson, a general contractor who has 
owned a house in the affected tract for eight years, said of the neighbors with 
whom he now shares a meal almost every night. "I'm getting to know people who I 
used to just wave at." 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster officials say they do not begrudge the residents the special 
attention they are receiving or the money being spent on them. "It's a lot of 
money," Mayor Charles V. Smith said, "but these people are very highly 
inconvenienced by this whole thing. I think it's great that the federal 
government was able to do this; there's no way the city could have done it." 
</P>
<P>
 And hotel officials describe the Westminster folks as almost perfect guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just try to make them feel at home while they're away from home," said 
Bruce Bitto, the inn's general manager. "It's working out well; nobody has 
asked for anything that anybody else wouldn't get." 
</P>
<P>
 About the only change he has made to accommodate the federally funded guests, 
Bitto said, is doubling the amount of free food available at the evening social 
hour. "They're very tight as a neighborhood," he said of the group. "They tend 
to stay longer and eat more." 
</P>
<P>
 The increased evening food allotment has received rave reviews from the 
Westminster bunch, many of whom say that they rely on it for their main daily 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't ask for anything nicer," said Vivian Jenner, who has lived at 
the inn for three months. "We all seem to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Delzeith: "I'm going to be spoiled rotten by the time I get home." 
</P>
<P>
 No situation is perfect, though, and this one too has its detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them is Delzeith's husband, Dennis, who says he has begun to miss 
something that many homeowners would willingly give a great deal to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any yardwork to do," Dennis Delzeith complained. "I like to 
putter around, and this is a little boring." 
</P>
<P>
 So how is he spending the extra time? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm catching up on my reading," said the toxic refugee.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will ease into a new political era today when three City Council 
members are sworn into office and residents get their first glimpse into what 
new leadership might mean to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In what will undoubtedly be an emotional transition for some, Mayor Ann 
Christoph and council members Robert F. Gentry and Lida Lenney will relinquish 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Christoph, who served only one term, lost in her bid for reelection. Gentry 
and Lenney, who together helped guide the city through a decade of liberal 
activism, did not seek another term. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have speculated that the city will take a sharp turn to the right 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
 But the newly elected council members have promised to govern with moderation, 
focusing attention on the basics of city government, including enhancing public 
safety and the city's infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry, who was the first openly gay elected leader in Orange County and an 
outspoken advocate for gay rights, admitted that it will be tough to relinquish 
the reins after 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost two houses in last year's firestorm and decided not to run for 
reelection so that he could concentrate on rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard, but it's got to happen; I've got work to do," Gentry said Monday. 
"I feel almost like a parent sending his or her child off to college. I hope 
they do the right thing, make the right decisions and make the family proud, so 
to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the oath of office will be real estate broker Wayne J. Baglin, attorney 
Steve Dicterow and Paul Freeman, a community relations specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Baglin served on the council in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Freeman was a 
city planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pro Tem Kathleen Blackburn, the council's only female member, is 
expected to be voted into the mayor's seat. LESLIE EARNEST

<P>
 A regional campaign to fight abuse of the elderly got a $12,000 boost Monday 
when local Offices on Aging received grants from a retirement community 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Office on Aging received $5,000 toward the advertising 
campaign, and Orange and Riverside counties' offices received $500 each for 
emergency relocation of abused seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Barbee, a spokeswoman for donor company ARV Housing Group, said the 
money going to the Orange and Riverside offices will be used by people who need 
help in moving from abusive situations. 
</P>
<P>
 ARV representatives made the grants at a ceremony at the company's Villa de 
Palma facility for the elderly in Placentia. The company operates seven other 
retirement communities in Orange County and 10 others in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5,000 donation to the Office on Aging will pay for part of a Southland 
advertising campaign scheduled to begin early next year. That campaign will 
include eight billboards and four bus shelter placards. Locations have not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards will give information on the signs of elder abuse and whom to 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 ARV also donated $6,000 to a state-monitored fund for relocation assistance 
and is working on developing a way that county offices providing adult 
protective services can help move seniors who are in danger. HOLLY J. WAGNER

 Teachers in the Garden Grove Unified School District have received almost 
$8,500 in grants through the Disneyland Fine Arts Partnership Program, a

<P>
 Forty-one teachers will share the grants, which help pay for projects and 
materials designed to involve children in visual and performing arts, said 
spokesman Alan Trudell. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers will use the grants to pay for field trips to the Bowers Museum in 
Santa Ana, for computer hardware to create animated videos and for professional 
choreographers for a dance class, Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards are distributed twice a year. Teachers districtwide won about 
$8,200 during the last round of grants, Trudell said. JON NALICK

 The City Council will soon consider toughening laws on property maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed changes in the law would allow fines for broken and unused machinery 
sitting on property and broken windows that are not promptly repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Another change would prohibit trash storage in front or side yards if visible 
from public streets. Trash and garbage also could not be stored in areas that 
are deemed public right of ways.

 No date has yet been set for consideration of these changes, which City

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COUNCIL REVISITS BAN ON FREEWAY BILLBOARDS 
TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new City Council will be confronted with an old controversy tonight when 
an advertising company renews its attempt to place 10 freeway billboards 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Regency Outdoor Advertising Inc. has been trying for a decade to persuade city 
officials to overturn a 25-year city ban on freeway billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 They lobbied unsuccessfully to overturn the ban in 1985, in 1988 and twice in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles company proposes to tear down 13 smaller billboards on 
arterial roadways in exchange for permission to erect 10 freeway signs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the idea was brought before the old council for consideration in August, 
members could not summon the votes to either reject or approve the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they voted to revisit the item tonight, with the new council seated. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Lou Lopez and Bob Zemel were sworn in last week, joining Mayor 
Tom Daly and Councilman Frank Feldhaus on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth member is still to be appointed or elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Irv Pickler, who had been the staunchest proponent for lifting the 
ban, completed his term on the council last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly has been firmly against lifting the ban. In August, he referred to the 
billboard proposal as "Dracula" and said: "I wish I could just drive a stake 
through its heart . . . so it would go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said this week that he plans to again make a motion to reject the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The company proposes to put four billboards at the junction of the Orange and 
Riverside freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs would be up to 60 feet above the road and 950 square feet. They 
would also be at least 500 feet apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, which include several members of the business community, have 
complained that the billboards would add clutter to the city and diminish its 
appearance. GREG HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; BEACH REPLENISHMENT TO RESUME IN THE SPRING

<TEXT>
<P>
 The delivery of truckloads of sand to the city's badly eroded beaches has 
ended, yielding only about half the expected amount. But City Manager Jerry L. 
Bankston said that after the winter rainy season is over, the city will have 
more opportunities to replenish beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15,000 cubic yards of sand was dumped on the beach east of the Seal 
Beach Pier, according to Bankston. It was trucked from the Santa Ana River 
flood-control project near Anaheim Stadium. The Army Corps of Engineers will 
not allow additional sand excavation until April because of the threat to 
workers in the flood-control channel during rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The delivery of an additional 15,000 cubic yards of sand from the same 
location will begin in April, but the total amount falls far short of the 
240,000 cubic yards of sand recommended in a 1984 beach erosion study. 
</P>
<P>
 A promising prospect for additional beach sand is the proposed dredging of a 
navigation channel outside the entrance to Long Beach Harbor. The Army Corps of 
Engineers estimates that the project would yield 5 million cubic yards of sand 
that could replenish a number of local beaches.RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; 5 YEARS LATER, DEMO CREW DOES IN DOME 
</P>

<P>
 Almost five years after the 30-foot high observation dome was erected on top 
of Mark Thompson's Sandpiper Drive home, it came down. 
</P>
<P>
 A contractor hired by Thompson removed the metal dome Monday, ending a long 
debate about height limits and community aesthetics initiated by next-door 
neighbor Jerry Andersen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had any number of people tell me over the years that I'd have to live 
with it," Andersen said. "I feel vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen began a petition drive in 1990 to demand enforcement of the city's 
25-foot height limit after he learned of Thompson's plans to build the 
observatory dome. In August, 1993, the City Council ordered Thompson to remove 
the dome within a year, citing a violation of height limits and zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But after several deadlines were passed, the city filed suit Nov. 28 to force 
the removal of the dome, even though Thompson assured the city he had hired a 
contractor for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, a financial adviser, said the space will be covered by a roof that 
matches the rest of his house. And what will he do with the dome? "I'm going to 
put it on my neighbor's house," Thompson joked, adding that it will be put in 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
 One elderly neighbor watching the dismantling of the dome said that he bears 
no ill will toward Thompson. "He's been a good man in the community, and it's 
unfortunate the whole thing occurred," he said. "We just thought this was out 
of place." RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; MEMBERS TO BE SWORN IN, OTHERS TO RETIRE

<P>
 The City Council and Redevelopment Agency are expected to be reorganized 
tonight, as some members retire and others are sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
 There will only be one new face on the council, Lynn Daucher, who was the top 
vote-getter in last month's election with 19.6% of the total ballots cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The election drew eight candidates in a race for three council seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Also being sworn in by City Clerk Elaine M. Capps will be incumbent council 
members Burnie Dunlap, who received 19.2% of the vote, and Glenn G. Parker, who 
drew 15.7% of the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 After the council members have taken their oaths of office, they will choose a 
new mayor and a new mayor pro tem, who will both serve one-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected that Mayor Pro Tem Bev Perry will become Brea's new mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Retiring from the council will be Carrey J. Nelson, who was appointed to the 
legislative body in June, 1978, and was first elected in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to run in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson was previously a member of the Brea Redevelopment Agency as well, but 
he resigned that position in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation came after the state Fair Political Practices Commission 
reported that Nelson's financial interest in a property within the 
redevelopment district may violate conflict-of-interest regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney declined to prosecute the matter because 
the statute of limitations had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Also retiring tonight will be Redevelopment Agency member and former mayor 
Gene Leyton. He was appointed to the agency after Nelson stepped down in 1993.

EXECUTIVE NAMED WINNER OF 1994 GOOD SCOUT AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parker Kennedy, president of both First American Financial Corp. and First 
American Title Insurance Co., won the 1994 Good Scout Award from the Orange 
County Council of Boy Scouts of America last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said he was not only honored but surprised by the award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not honored because of my ability as a Scout," he said. In fact, he 
said, he could not remember any particular thing at which he excelled in 
Scouting when he was a child. "I had no clue," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 He was chosen for the contributions his companies have made to the Scouts -- 
some $4,000 each year plus money from special events, said Shannon Paradzick of 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scouting is especially important for the young boys and girls who do not 
necessarily get a lot of encouragement for what they do," Kennedy told the 
council at the 13th Annual Construction Industry Good Scout Award Luncheon on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Council of the Scouts chooses a representative from the 
construction industry each year for the award, Paradzick said. "They have been 
very supportive," she said of the First American companies. The annual 
construction luncheon alone raises about $132,000, she said.

6 HURT AS SHOOTOUT STARTS CHAIN OF COLLISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six people were injured Monday night when a pickup truck driver, apparently 
fleeing a shootout, crashed on a residential street and set off a chain of 
collisions, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 7:35 p.m. when the occupants of the truck and another 
vehicle exchanged words near the intersection of Garnsey and Cubbon streets, 
Sgt. Anthony Levatino said.Gunfire erupted from one or both of the vehicles, 
and the pickup crashed a block away, Levatino said. The truck, which was 
believed to have passengers in the bed, rolled over and caught fire.  
</P>
<P>
 The crash set off five other collisions at the same spot, Levatino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levatino said six people were taken to area hospitals, at least two of them 
with gunshot wounds. None of the injuries was believed to be life-threatening, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one had been arrested.

6 POLICE EMPLOYEES SUE LAGUNA BEACH OVER TAPED CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN MARQUEZ OWEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six Laguna Beach Police Department employees filed suit Monday against the 
city of Laguna Beach, contending that Police Department supervisors 
tape-recorded their personal conversations at work and disciplined them for 
what they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees, including police officers, dispatchers and records clerks, are 
seeking damages for what they allege was violation of their privacy rights 
under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed in Orange County Superior Court and claims that throughout 
1993, police officials taped and reviewed the employees' private conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 The taping issue first surfaced in January of this year, when workers learned 
that their idle conversations, including comments about their superiors, had 
been recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials blamed the tapings on faulty telephone equipment, which has 
since been replaced. They also denied disciplining any employee because of 
conversations that were taped. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said the faulty equipment was in place for about seven months 
before being discovered. Calls to the Police Department are routinely recorded 
to ensure that employees respond appropriately to the public, and to document 
conversations that could be used in court. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of a glitch in the system, the faulty telephone equipment 
continued to record the conversations of the employees after the calls from 
outside the department had ended, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees who filed suit are Richard Seapin, Richard Jeffries, Debbie 
Kelso, Hilda Madrid, Mary Jones and George Ramos.

BARTER TILL YOU DROP; TRADING FOR GOODS, SERVICES GROWS EVEN IN RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Brian Stevens got married, he went all out. He hired a limousine and a 
band. He ordered engraved invitations, flowers, food and dozens of boxes of 
candy with the date of the wedding embossed in gold. 
</P>
<P>
 No cash changed hands, though. Stevens, owner of Aloha Graphics & Printing in 
Costa Mesa, bartered printed business cards and flyers as payment for the 
entire celebration. Stevens also bartered a honeymoon in Hawaii with his bride. 
And when their first child was born, the Stevenses paid the $8,000 in medical 
bills by firing up the printing equipment again. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by the recession, which left many businesses cash-poor but with an 
abundance of inventory, bartering for goods and services has grown, and 
Southern California is leading the way. It is home to some of the largest U.S. 
barter exchanges as well as the one national magazine, BarterNews, devoted to 
the topic. The magazine, which has a circulation of 30,000, is headquartered in 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to say that we can get you anything you need, from the cradle to the 
grave," said Katherine Picquelle, spokeswoman for Orange-based 
TradeAmericanCard, "meaning that we have obstetricians to morticians and 
everything in between available for barter. You can trade printing services for 
pot-bellied pigs if you want." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is growing nationwide. About $7 billion worth of barter business 
was conducted in the United States and Canada in 1993, up from $6.4 billion the 
year before, according to the International Reciprocal Trade Assn. in 
Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The common wisdom about bartering is that it blossoms during economic 
downturns, when people have little cash. Bartering is particularly attractive 
to small businesses as an alternative to cash purchases of goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's prolonged economic slump made the region a perfect 
environment for barter exchanges, which act as brokers for companies that want 
to make swaps. Now, even with a recovery underway, traders are reluctant to 
abandon their frugal ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "When times are tough, barter is a nice alternative," said Jack Kyser, chief 
economist at the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. "Once you 
get involved with it and see what it can do, you keep doing it because it makes 
life easier." 
</P>
<P>
 A widespread misconception about bartering is that participants avoid paying 
taxes. Both traders and brokers are quick to point out that the barter 
exchanges send both clients and the Internal Revenue Service a form stating the 
dollar value of the year's transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not dampen the enthusiasm of veteran traders. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheri Gregg, controller for Irvine-based Advanced Business Machines, said her 
company has taken to bartering in recent years and plans to increase the amount 
of swapping it does to about $250,000 next year. That would be up from the 
$150,000 projected for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love it. The bottom line is we save cash when we do this," Gregg said. 
"Besides, the owner is a true entrepreneur, so he is a wheeler-dealer. 
Bartering fits into his lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason that bartering may find a permanent place in the local economy 
is that the economic downturn spawned scores of small companies -- the 
businesses most likely to barter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy went through a restructuring," said Jon Goodman, director of the 
entrepreneur program at USC. Southern California's economy has undergone a 
permanent shift, he said, favoring companies that are more agile and adaptable 
-- typically the start-ups. Those entrepreneurial firms have been quick to 
recognize that swapping goods and services is a creative and cost-effective way 
to do business, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though bartering is now gaining wider acceptance, the concept is not new. 
Barter Exchange International, the nation's oldest barter exchange company, was 
founded 34 years ago in Huntington Beach. The firm has since moved its 
headquarters to Burbank, but it still has a strong presence in Orange County, 
with 600 corporate members registered at its office in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is also home base for the nation's largest independent barter 
exchange. TradeAmericanCard, in business for more than 20 years, has a 
membership of 2,500 companies. Its annual trade volume, valued at $12 million, 
leads the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big barter brokerage, Itex Corp. of Portland, Ore., will make its 
first move into California when it opens an office in Westminster on New Year's 
Day. The company plans to have 20 offices in Southern California within five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry even has its own expositions. TradeAmericanCard hosted Barter 
Expo last week in Buena Park. The event showcased the products and services of 
the brokerage's clients. Another barter exchange, BXI of Orange County, will 
stage an expo Sunday at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. It is free 
and open to the public.

MARKET FOR ORANGE COUNTY BONDS DRIES UP; FINANCES: INVESTORS EXPRESS CONCERN 
THAT $1.5 BILLION IN POTENTIAL LOSSES COULD GROW. RISING INTEREST RATES 
COMPOUND THE DISASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The market for bonds issued by Orange County and its agencies continued to 
evaporate Monday as bond traders and investors expressed mounting concern that 
the $1.5 billion in potential losses suffered by the county's investment fund 
could grow substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread suspicion that more losses could be uncovered effectively froze 
most trading. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are a lot more concerned than they were last week," said Robert Gore, 
a bond trader with the Crowell Weedon & Co. investment banking firm in Los 
Angeles. "Nobody really knows what's in the fund." 
</P>
<P>
 The reluctance of new buyers to step forward means most current holders of 
Orange County and related bonds -- including mutual funds and individuals -- 
may be stuck holding the paper at least until the county fund's financial 
situation becomes clearer. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent auditors for Orange County expressed uncertainty about the 
county's finances on Monday. Peggy McBride, a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick in 
Costa Mesa, the county's auditor for the past three years, said her firm had 
not yet decided whether it will complete a regularly scheduled review of county 
finances slated to be finished by the end of December. The report includes an 
audit of the county investment pool, which was valued at $18.5 billion as of 
Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has not yet been decided, now that all this has happened," she said. "We 
don't know if it will be released on time." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of apprehension about the county's financial strength, those few 
investors offering to buy Orange County bonds or those of the county's 
municipalities were demanding price discounts of at least 10% below similar, 
untainted bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 News late last week that credit rating agency Standard & Poor's Corp. had put 
Orange County debt issues on watch for possible downgrading helped cause 
further deterioration in the market for the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles broker, who asked not to be identified, attempted unsuccessfully 
to sell about $2 million worth of Orange County school district notes from an 
issue in June, which has become controversial because of rare guarantees that 
the invested proceeds would not lose money. Reportedly, at least one large 
mutual fund was also unable to find a buyer for similar bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County bonds are getting hammered," said Sandra Allworth, a partner at 
Artemis Capital Group in New York. "They (investors) are getting some bids on 
Orange County bonds but they are nothing like they would normally get." 
</P>
<P>
 Traders noted, however, that the municipal bond market is generally an 
illiquid market, where many small bond issues trade infrequently. So gauging 
true supply and demand at any moment can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's situation did not seem to have an impact on the overall 
municipal bond market, which held firm Monday. The San Francisco Redevelopment 
Agency, for example, succeeded in selling $116 million worth of bonds without 
paying a penalty in the form of higher interest rates. The 30-year bonds were 
priced to yield 6.94%. 
</P>
<P>
 In more bad news for Orange County, short-term interest rates surged again on 
Monday, responding to new signs of economic strength. Each increase in short 
rates boosts the cost of the loans the county has used to buy long-term bonds. 
That could force further collateral calls on the county fund, draining 
available cash resources. 
</P>
<P>
 David Herships, an analyst with investment banking firm Kemper Securities in 
Chicago, put out a report Monday echoing most market participants' fears about 
increased losses to the Orange County portfolio, which represent about 20% of 
the amount actually invested. Of most concern, he said, is a $110-million 
pension bond issue sold by the county in September, which allow buyers to 
demand their money back from the county on seven days' notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like walking into the bank and asking for your money back. Their county 
treasurer promised a lot of people a lot of things," said Herships. "'They've 
got a lot of problems. Who knows what the real losses are?"

ENERGY FIRMS AGREE TO MERGE FOR $950 MILLION; ACQUISITIONS: SURPRISE 
ANNOUNCEMENT COMES AFTER CALIFORNIA ENERGY SWEETENS BID FOR MAGMA POWER TO $39 
A SHARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprising turnabout that cost a handful of overeager traders about $1 
million, rival geothermal producers California Energy Co. and Magma Power Co. 
said Monday that they agreed to merge after California Energy raised its offer 
to $39 a share, or $950 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which would create the world's largest independent geothermal 
producer, stunned several Wall Street observers. Many thought that San 
Diego-based Magma Power had successfully fought off California Energy's hostile 
takeover effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Friday, Omaha-based California Energy said it was calling off its 
$38.50-a-share, $925-million hostile tender offer for Magma Power after failing 
to enlist the support of Dow Chemical Co., which owns 21% of Magma Power 
shares, and B.C. McCabe Trust, which owns 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dow, Magma's largest shareholder, took a decisive role over the weekend to 
persuade the two companies to forge a merger agreement, California Energy 
Chairman David Sokol said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow arranged a Saturday meeting in New York between Sokol and Magma Power 
Chairman Paul Pankratz and Chief Executive Ralph Boeker, Sokol said. After 
California Energy sweetened its offer, the two sides came up with an agreement 
that was unanimously approved early Monday by Magma Power's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms call for a new tender offer to commence Dec. 9 in which California 
Energy will pay $39 for each Magma Power share in a combination of $28.50 cash 
and $10.50 in California Energy stock. The acquirer will pay cash for the first 
50.3% of Magma Power shares tendered. Sokol said California Energy will attempt 
to pay cash for the rest of Magma's shares if financing can be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Dow Chief Financial Officer Enrique C. Falla said he was 
delighted by the agreement. He was not available to comment further on Dow's 
role in the pact. Pankratz and Boeker, both former Dow executives, were 
unavailable for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Daniele Seitz of UBS Securities said Magma Power was forced belatedly 
to accept the California Energy bid after failing to elicit "a big, fat premium 
or a white knight, which never showed up." 
</P>
<P>
 While analysts generally viewed the offer as fair for Magma Power 
shareholders, some, including Michael Cha of J.P. Morgan Securities, lamented 
the fact that the two companies didn't announce an agreement earlier Monday or 
over the weekend. 
</P>

 As it was, owners of about 100,000 Magma Power shares lost about $1 million by 
selling their stock in private transactions early Monday at about $28 a share 
-- the price when the takeover bid was launched in September -- figuring 
Friday's news of the termination of tender offer would cause share prices to 
fall, Cha said.

<P>
 Official trading of both companies' stock was suspended at the market's 
opening Monday and resumed after the merger was announced at 9:30 a.m. EST. 
Magma Power shares closed up $1.875 at $37.375 on the Nasdaq, while California 
Energy stock closed down 87.5 cents at $15.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: U.S. PENSION PLAN DEFICIT GROWS 34% TO $71 
BILLION 
</P>

 The nation's defined-benefit pension plans are $71 billion short of the amount 
needed to pay benefits to prospective retirees, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly as a result of low interest rates and poor investment returns, the gap 
between what companies have in pension reserves and what they've promised in 
retirement benefits widened nearly 34% in 1993 from 1992, government officials 
said. Roughly 8 million workers are at risk -- and about 1.2 million of them 
are employed by financially ailing companies that may have difficulty making up 
the shortfall, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pensions at risk are primarily in the steel, auto, tire and airline 
industries, according to Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich. If a pension plan 
fails, Pension Benefit Guaranty coverage is limited to $30,681.84 per 
individual this year, often less than the promised benefit. The annually 
adjusted payment will be $30,886.32 next year. A list of companies with 
troubled plans will be released next year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is also good news on the pension front that could avert a 
crisis. Passed with the recently approved General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade are measures aimed at making retirement plans safer. While some critics 
say the reforms are insufficient, the bill is at least a step in the right 
direction, according to other pension experts. 
</P>
<P>
 The pension measures, dubbed the Retirement Protection Act of 1994, give 
government pension officials greater authority to penalize companies that fail 
to keep their retirement plans viable. They also require administrators of 
underfunded plans to disclose more information to affected workers, including 
the plan's funding levels and the limitations on Pension Benefit Guaranty 
coverage.  
</P>
<P>
 Pension Benefit Guaranty backs 66,000 defined-benefit plans. But the agency 
does not back -- or police -- defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k) 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the new law requires pension plans that are less than 60% funded 
to contribute extra funds until the plan is in better shape. And it allows 
government officials to dramatically boost insurance premiums for underfunded 
plans -- sometimes actually doubling or tripling premiums. On the other hand, 
plans that are fully funded are relieved of quarterly contribution requirements 
and companies that offer both defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans 
will be granted excise tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The law bars companies from using dubious accounting techniques to make their 
plans seem healthier than they are. Particularly targeted are plans that 
double-counted certain assets and those that made faulty assumptions about 
prospective interest rates and employee mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies determine how much they need to fund their pension plans by making 
assumptions about how long their employees will work and draw pensions and how 
much interest the pension savings will earn before workers begin draining the 
fund.  
</P>
<P>
 If a company assumes its workers will all die within months of retirement -- 
or that its pension assets will double and triple thanks to stunning investment 
earnings, it needs less money in the pension. Pension guaranty officials, who 
pick up the tab when these assumptions prove flawed, can now require specific 
mortality and interest rate tables in calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 Underfunded plans will also be required to provide more information to both 
Pension Benefit Guaranty and their workers. For example, pension officials must 
be provided with advance notice of transactions that might jeopardize employee 
pensions. Pension Benefit Guaranty will now have the right to object -- and 
sometimes bar -- transactions that would jeopardize pensions. (A recently 
passed bankruptcy law also gives pension officials a bigger voice in bankruptcy 
proceedings.) 
</P>
<P>
 Workers, on the other hand, will be given clear disclosure statements that 
describe the pension plan's funding level and the limitations on Pension 
Benefit Guaranty coverage. Only troubled plans will be required to provide the 
additional disclosures, but pension officials believe the program will generate 
such employee interest that all plans will revise and improve the information 
provided to workers.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the act gives Pension Benefit Guaranty the ability to take companies 
to court if they miss more than $1 million in payments to their pension plans. 
This provision is expected to dramatically aid pension officials in heading off 
serious underfunding problems. Indeed, officials said the act nearly guarantees 
that large underfunded plans will strengthen and that the chronic deficits 
suffered by the pension guaranty organization will be eliminated within 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great day for American workers," Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich 
said in a statement. "Pension promises will be kept and the PBGC will remain 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 However, other pension experts say the bill is no panacea. Stephen R. Kerns, 
president of the American Society of Pension Actuaries in Washington, said more 
is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Current rules, even in the new law, limit the amount that companies can 
contribute to their pension plans. Companies that want to contribute more -- 
because they think that either their workers will live longer than average or 
that the plan will earn less on its money -- are restricted from doing so, 
Kerns said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a real crisis coming down the road when the baby boomers begin to 
retire," he said. "If we don't have something comprehensive in place before 
that happens, I'm afraid we're going to be in real trouble." Growing Gap 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between what U.S. companies have in pension reserves and what 
they are estimated to need for retirement benefits rose nearly 34% in 1993. The 
shortfall, in billions of dollars:

UNOCAL TO WRITE OFF $500 MILLION; MOVE PUTS IT IN THE RED; ENERGY: CHARGE 
REFLECTS LOWER VALUES FOR FIELDS AND AN ONGOING REORGANIZATION. ANALYSTS CALL 
THE MOVE A POSITIVE ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a move that will plunge the company into the red this year, Unocal Corp. 
said Monday that it will write off nearly $500 million after taxes to reflect 
lower values for gas and oil fields and larger-than-expected environmental 
cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The big fourth-quarter charge reflects an ongoing reorganization at the Los 
Angeles-based energy company, which is cutting operating costs and trimming 
money-losing operations, industry analysts said. The charge includes, for 
example, $15 million to cover a 40% reduction in corporate staff announced last 
month. The cuts will eliminate about 630 jobs over two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is part and parcel of the broad changes going on" at Unocal, said energy 
analyst Eugene L. Nowak at Dean Witter in New York. "It's a realistic 
adjustment to what's happening. It should be viewed as a positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal and analysts said the oil and gas write-off is primarily an accounting 
change that will have no cash impact. The lower values of some domestic natural 
gas and oil fields will actually reduce Unocal's depreciation expenses by about 
$70 million, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 About $275 million of the after-tax charge comes from a change in the way the 
company values its oil and natural gas reserves. Instead of putting a value on 
all Unocal properties in one country, the company broke the value down on a 
field-by-field basis to get a more accurate look at the performance of its 
holdings, spokesman Barry Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fields whose value was reduced are located in the Central United States, 
including Texas and Louisiana. Oil fields off the California coast are also 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also wrote down $22 million after taxes on non-oil and gas 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane said the revaluation of property values was not related to any other 
changes at the company. But Nowak at Dean Witter said the field write-offs 
could be a prelude to their possible sale. Several big oil companies have been 
selling their U.S. oil fields in favor of overseas holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be selling a lot of properties," Nowak said. "They will try to 
focus on profitable products." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal said it will also add between $93 million and $155 million after taxes 
to reserves earmarked for environmental cleanup after discovering that the 
costs of cleaning up properties either closed or sold were higher than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company expects to record a $22-million after-tax charge for 
litigation expenses. Lane said the increase is not related to a particular 
case.

 Approval Recommended for Heart Device: A Food and Drug Administration advisory 
panel made the recommendation for the Thoratec Laboratories Corp. product, 
which beats for a failing heart while the patient awaits a transplant. The 
device takes over all or part of a failed heart's function for patients who 
might otherwise die while waiting for a donor heart. The clinical trials of 
Berkeley-based Thoratec's device showed that about two-thirds of patients who 
received the device survived until a transplant was performed.

 Borden Rejects Takeover Proposal: The food and consumer products company said 
the acquisition proposal from investor Paul Kazarian is unrealistic.Borden, in 
a letter to Kazarian's Japonica Partners, said Japonica had failed to 
sufficiently respond to Borden's concerns about the deal's financing, the 
earnings and share price increases that would supposedly follow the 
transaction, and various legal and other concerns. Seeking to derail a buyout 
of Borden by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Co., the Rhode Island investment group led 
by Kazarian last week sketched out a complex proposal valued at about $2.4 
billion. The KKR offer expires Dec. 20. Borden's stock fell 25 cents to $13.625 
on the New York Stock Exchange.KAZARIAN, PAUL

PATENT OFFICE DEALS SECOND BLOW IN SEGMENT OF SOFTWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has tentatively rejected a patent that 
had given a small La Costa, Calif., company broad rights over any sort of 
advertising in computer software programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision marks the second time in recent months that the agency has thrown 
out a broad patent that had drawn widespread protest from the software 
industry.The earlier decision quashed a patent held by Compton's New Media of 
Carlsbad, Calif., on multimedia search and retrieval processes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the agency has rejected a 1992 patent issued to Software Advertising 
Corp., citing "indefinite language" that failed to establish a specific 
invention. Under the patent, if Bill Gates had wanted to plug, say, Twinkies on 
Microsoft's Windows software operating system, he would have had to pay 
Software Advertising Corp. for a license. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the patent rejection was released Monday by PC Dynamics, a small 
Westlake Village company that publishes a "screen saver" featuring the 
Energizer Bunny, a longtime advertising symbol of Eveready batteries. In March, 
Software Advertising had demanded royalties from the company, alleging that the 
bunny infringed its patent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a freedom issue involved here," said Peter Avritch, president of PC 
Dynamics. "People are paying for my product . . . because they think the 
Energizer Bunny is cute. I am not pushing batteries." PC Dynamics pays Eveready 
a licensing fee for use of the pink, drum-banging character in its screen 
savers, which cost $20 to $25 at retail. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Ekedal, president of Software Advertising, vowed to continue his fight 
for the patent. Under agency procedures, his company has 60 days to file 
back-up documents and seek a reissue of the patent before the rejection is 
finalized.

annual rate of 726,000 units, the Commerce Department reported. That was the 
highest since 817,000 last December. New home sales rose in all regions except 
the Northeast. They were up 14.4% in the West.

DISNEY, CHEVRON DECRY BOYCOTT OVER PROP. 187; POLITICS: FIRMS SAY THEY DIDN'T 
SUPPORT MEASURE, THOUGH BOTH BACKED WILSON'S REELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two corporations targeted in a boycott over Proposition 187 -- Walt Disney Co. 
and Chevron Corp. -- decried the action Monday, saying they never supported the 
sweeping ballot measure to deny non-emergency government services to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney took no position on 187, Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney is not anti any particular ethnic group," McClintock said. "I hope 
that everybody who considers this boycott would consider very carefully just 
what it is that they're boycotting." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in Tucson on Sunday, a coalition of Latino activists employed by 
small, grass-roots organizations formally called for a boycott of "all 
businesses, tourism, vacations, conferences and meetings" in California, 
particularly targeting Disney and Chevron, until Proposition 187 is repealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking everyone not to go to California for vacations, tourism and 
meetings, much the way people boycotted Arizona after the state failed to adopt 
the Martin Luther King holiday," said organizer Jesus Romo Vejar, a Tucson 
attorney. "This is not a negotiable issue. Proposition 187 has to be repealed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of last month's passage of the measure, Latino leaders in 
Colorado, Texas and other states have announced that they were considering 
boycotts of California and the products and services of its companies. But only 
a handful of concrete actions -- primarily by journalism groups -- had been 
taken to initiate a boycott. Last month, the National Lesbian and Gay 
Journalists Assn. decided to move a national convention to be held in Beverly 
Hills in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The boycott will concentrate initially on Disney and Chevron because those 
corporations contributed heavily to the reelection efforts of Gov. Pete Wilson, 
who made Proposition 187 the cornerstone of his campaign, Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney made contributions to both candidates for governor, McClintock said. 
Disneyland has received phone calls about the issue but attendance at the park 
has not been affected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron spokesman Jim Hendon said the San Francisco-based oil company is aware 
it has been named as a target. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking the reports seriously and we're trying to find out more, but it 
isn't clear yet whether there is a boycott and what form it will take," Hendon 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Chevron contributed nearly $123,000 to Wilson's campaign and $5,000 to 
Democrat Kathleen Brown's campaign, but it took no stand on 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Romo acknowledged that a boycott could hurt Latinos employed in the Southern 
California tourism and restaurant industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take our position with a great deal of pain, realizing that it will have 
an adverse impact on the people we're trying to protect," Romo said. "But 
Proposition 187 isn't just about California. It's about the whole nation." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the rebounding tourism industry has not noticed any boycott and no 
groups have canceled meetings at the Los Angeles Convention Center, said 
Michael Collins, senior vice president of the Los Angeles Convention & Visitors 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the boycott say they plan to reach out to larger mainstream groups 
and leaders in coming weeks for support of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real success in this will be getting all the organizations that were 
present (in Tucson) to get the word out to national organizations and other 
ethnic groups," said Roberto Martinez, who runs the American Friends Service 
Committee office in San Diego. Martinez said he supports the boycott but that 
the national Quaker-based service organization for which he works hasn't taken 
a position. 
</P>
<P>
 Major organizations that have taken no position include the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the National Assn. of Latino Elected and 
Appointed Officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're neutral on the issue for the reason that it's not our purview," MALDEF 
spokesman Robert Almanzan said. "MALDEF's job in the 187 issue is to follow 
through with our litigation -- that's our mission and what we're doing."

<P>
 General Motors Corp. for the first time Monday proposed a coordinated plan to 
get ready for the sale of electric cars, as required by California's 1998 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 A GM executive speaking at the 12th International Electric Vehicle Symposium 
in Anaheim laid out a six-point agenda of conditions the auto maker considers 
necessary for a successful commercial introduction of electric vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions range from a broad-scale battery-leasing program to a 
commitment by governments at all levels to buy thousands of electric cars, 
trucks and vans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time for debate is over," GM Vice President Kenneth R. Baker said. "Those 
who are serious about commercializing electrics must set the agenda for action 
and begin to act today -- and not wait for others." 
</P>
<P>
 A GM spokesman later made it clear that GM remains opposed to the 1998 
deadline set by California, under which 2% of the vehicles sold in the state 
that year by the seven biggest sellers of vehicles must be emission-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, though the proposal pulls together a grab bag of ideas already under 
discussion, electric car proponents -- often at odds with the world's biggest 
auto maker -- saw the proposal as a softening of GM's opposition to the 
California mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applaud an auto maker stepping forward and saying, 'We have a rational 
plan,' " said Diane Wittenberg, vice president of the electric transportation 
division of Southern California Edison Co. "It's a lot better than hand 
wringing." 
</P>
<P>
 Though parties to the debate have long discussed the kinds of steps that must 
be taken to create and support a market for electric vehicles, the auto makers 
have largely spoken of the limitations of the technology. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, GM sounded "more optimistic than usual," said Cecile M. Martin, 
deputy executive director of the utility-supported California Electric 
Transportation Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's conditions: 
</P>
<P>
 * The creation of a large demonstration program, in which the federal and 
state governments, some cities and electric utilities would buy cars for resale 
to ordinary drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outright government fleet purchase of thousands of electric vehicles -- in 
GM's case perhaps half its roughly 5,000-vehicle obligation under the 1998 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 * State and federal incentives of approximately $10,000 per vehicle to 
encourage sale of cars directly from manufacturers. A federal tax credit now 
returns up to $4,000 to electric car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Utilities' establishment of recharging structures and other support. 
</P>
<P>
 * State government programs to lease advanced batteries to car buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Installation by state and local governments of fast-charging public 
facilities, equivalent to gasoline service stations, for drivers who run low on 
juice before they make it home.

INITIAL PCS BIDS TAKEN; TOTAL EXPECTED TO EXCEED $10 BILLION 
</P>

 With three bangs of his gavel, Vice President Al Gore opened the bidding 
Monday in the federal government's eagerly awaited auction of licenses for new 
mobile phones, declaring that the technology will create a million jobs and 
transform the way Americans communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction of 99 licenses to offer so-called broad-band personal 
communications services is the first step in a costly, high-stakes contest by 
some of the biggest names in telecommunications to bring a new type of wireless 
communications to the masses. The new services, expected to be launched in 
major markets within the next two years, will feature mobile communications 
devices that are smaller, cheaper and more powerful than existing cellular 
telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Monday's initial round of bidding was subdued, with none of the 
30 bidders quickly separating itself from the pack with a huge wager. Bids 
totaled $380 million, with 39 of the 99 PCS licenses drawing no bids at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no great surprises; it went pretty much as we anticipated," said 
Roy Berger, a member of one of the wealthiest teams -- the PSC Primco limited 
partnership made up of AirTouch Communications and three regional Bell 
telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the deep-pockets competition, at least one small company, Micro 
Lithography of Sunnyvale, Calif., held its own and emerged as the top bidder 
for two PCS licenses, with a bid of $20,000 for both. 
</P>
<P>
 More typically, bids were in the multimillion-dollar range, with American 
Portable Telecommunications bidding nearly $51 million for a single PCS 
license. The 99 licenses on the block are for regional markets, with smaller 
market licenses to be sold early next year. In the end, about 2,100 PCS 
licenses will be auctioned, with total proceeds expected to exceed $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 About $4 billion of the auction money has already been earmarked to reduce the 
federal deficit. But expectations are high that the bids will exceed that 
amount, and politicians at Monday's opening quickly floated proposals on ways 
to spend the extra cash.

 Panel Predicts Strong Economic Growth in '95: The 17-member panel of 
executives, academics and other labor market experts is forecasting that the 
nation's strong economic growth will continue next year and that U.S. 
unemployment will remain at about 5.6%. The Human Resources Forecast group -- 
sponsored by UCLA's graduate school of management and headed by New York labor 
economist Audrey Freedman -- said the recovery of America's trading partners is 
extending the nation's business expansion. At the same time, the panel found 
that the growing wage gap in the U.S. economy is "sapping the American sense of 
well-being."

 November Car, Truck Sales Rise 5.1%: Detroit's Big Three auto makers reported 
the increase as customers snapped up new models as fast as companies could make 
them.General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said they sold 
881,076 vehicles in November, up from 837,714 a year ago. Their domestic car 
sales were up 0.6% to 435,940, and domestic truck sales rose 10.8% to 432,227. 
Dealers said sales could have been higher if there were more ample supplies of 
new models, such as GM's Chevrolet Blazer and Cavalier and Chrysler's Cirrus 
sedan.

BANKERS TRUST TO REVAMP DERIVATIVES; INVESTMENT: THE UNUSUAL AGREEMENT WITH THE 
FED COMES IN THE WAKE OF CLIENTS' BIG LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under fire for arranging investments that went sour, Bankers Trust New York 
Corp. agreed with the Federal Reserve Board to overhaul part of its derivatives 
business, the central bank said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time the Fed has taken a bank under supervision in the area 
of derivatives, a Fed spokesman said. "A written agreement is a serious 
enforcement action, enforceable through the courts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A written agreement is the second-most serious of three reprimands that 
regulators impose on banks and their units. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual agreement comes after Bankers Trust's clients, among them consumer 
products firm Procter & Gamble Co., revealed millions of dollars in losses from 
derivative investments arranged by the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Although derivatives -- complex financial instruments based on an underlying 
security -- are designed to hedge against risk, some of the investments lost 
enormous amounts of money when interest rates turned sharply upward last year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest losses in the area -- unrelated to Bankers Trust -- was 
disclosed last week when Orange County said its investment fund had lost $1.5 
billion in value, partly because of derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement between the Fed and Bankers Trust amounts to a huge 
housecleaning of the bank's derivatives business, one of the biggest of any 
bank. It calls for everything from new policies to greater management oversight 
-- all under the supervision of the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a rap on the knuckles for Bankers Trust," PaineWebber Inc. analyst 
Lawrence Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how you slice it, Bankers Trust has agreed to change its conduct 
and has implicitly agreed that it was not acting properly in the past. There is 
no question that these were bad boys," Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers Trust said disciplinary actions were taken against certain individuals 
as part of the agreement. It emphasized that the agreement with the Fed is 
limited to the company's leveraged derivatives transaction business, which 
accounted for less than 5% of its total revenue from Jan. 1, 1993, through the 
first three quarters of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement states that the policies must ensure the bank's derivatives 
business is "consistent with safe and sound banking practices."

COMPANY TOWN; MURDOCH FIRES BACK AT NBC OVER LEGAL CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fox Inc. Chairman Rupert Murdoch -- furious over rival NBC's effort to have 
the Federal Communications Commission declare Fox's ownership structure illegal 
-- responded Monday with a combative letter calling NBC's ploy "a blatant 
attempt to preserve the status quo" in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-page letter, addressed to FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt, accompanied a 
lengthy legal response to NBC's recent petition to the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC wants the agency to declare Fox foreign-owned and thus in violation of a 
federal statute that generally limits foreigners to no more than a 25% stake in 
U.S. broadcast stations. Murdoch also took to the phones to press his case with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old federal law on foreign ownership of U.S. communications 
properties stands as one of the few remaining restrictions on communications 
ownership in an increasingly global communications age. But the law is 
ambiguous in crucial respects and has not been widely tested. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to the FCC, Murdoch, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in 
Australia, said officials of his native country treat Fox, a unit of Murdoch's 
News Corp., as an American company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I am an American and because I control News Corp., our company is 
deemed to be an American-controlled foreign company under Australian law and 
therefore, neither I nor News Corp. is eligible to hold more than a 15% 
interest in broadcast licenses in Australia." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Murdoch accused NBC of "abuse of the (legal) system" and said 
the network would rather "compete by using legal tricks instead of engaging in 
open competition" in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch also said he will not hesitate to raise questions about controversial 
past activities of NBC's parent, General Electric Co., including allegations of 
fraud involving the sale of computer equipment to the government in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But NBC general counsel Richard Cotton said NBC will stick to its guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "No amount of (Fox) rhetoric will change the fact that more than 99% of the 
Fox TV stations are owned by an alien corporation," Cotton said. "The question 
is, is the commission going to enforce its historical interpretation and 
require Fox to comply with the law?"

COMPANY TOWN; ASSOCIATION ANNOUNCES WAR ON MUSIC PIRACY IN RUSSIA; COMMERCE: 
RECORDING INDUSTRY TRADE GROUP WANTS TO PROTECT RUSSIAN FIRMS AND LURE WESTERN 
LABELS TO THE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Every weekend, hundreds of Russian music fans flock to Moscow's Fili Park to 
shop for audio recordings in a huge, open-air market. Every kind of music, from 
Rachmaninoff to the Rolling Stones and even brand-new American releases, can be 
found on the sellers' rickety tables. 
</P>
<P>
 There's just one catch: Nearly every album, cassette and compact disc is 
pirated. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat the bootlegging that is strangling Russia's legitimate music 
business and infuriating Western studios and trade associations, a powerful 
international recording industry association declared war Monday on audio 
piracy in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents 
more than 1,000 record companies worldwide, hopes to protect Russian recording 
firms and lure Western companies reluctant to set up shop here lest their 
recordings, too, be sold on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation's new Moscow office will lobby for stronger anti-piracy laws 
and tougher prosecution of suspected bootleggers "so that producers in other 
parts of the world, including California, will be able to think about this 
market as one to invest in," said Nicholas Garnett, the group's general 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation plans to forge links with such Russian law enforcement agencies 
as the Interior Ministry, the former KGB and the customs service, helping them 
launch a coordinated attack against bootlegging. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the government allows (pirating) to happen, it sends the wrong signal to 
companies ready to invest," Garnett said. "Getting your intellectual property 
laws, your copyrights, your trademarks, your patents in place and properly 
enforced is a very important factor in securing foreign investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's problem with audio piracy is massive, Garnett said, noting: "You're 
talking 70%, 80%, 90% pirated (recordings) in some kinds of repertoire. Most of 
the international market here is pirated." 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the federation estimates that in the United States, only about 
4% of recordings sold are pirated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Russian artists and producers have complained bitterly about the 
illegal production and import of CDs and cassettes, few concrete steps have 
been taken until now to fight it. In the past two years, the Russian Parliament 
has passed several intellectual property protection laws, but enforcement 
remains sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation plans to work with the newly formed Russian Phonographic Assn., 
which represents 18 Russian recording houses, including London-based PolyGram 
Records and Melodiya, once the Soviet Union's only record producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Garnett acknowledges it won't be easy to stem the tide of illegal recordings 
that stream from China, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Belarus and elsewhere in the former 
Soviet Union. "It's very complicated, and in some ways a very dangerous 
situation," he said, alluding to the organized-crime faction believed to be 
taking a cut from the lucrative smuggling business. 
</P>
<P>
 Irina Savelyeva, head of the federation's Moscow office, said that "many other 
crimes can be tied in to pirating -- racketeering, money laundering."  
</P>
<P>
 Record company executives greeted the announcement warmly.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have 10 or 20 copies of different albums of ours from all over the world, 
made illegally from CDs or music cassettes," said Vladimir Kozlov, owner of 
Moscow's ZeKo records. "This organization has the money and the links to solve 
any problem in this area."

VENTURA COUNTY ROUNDUP: LONG-TROUBLED OFFICE BUILDING 98% OCCUPIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Compiled by Jack Searles

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a year after a new owner took over, Oxnard's long-troubled 1000 Town 
Center Drive office building is now 98% occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 The green glass structure near the Ventura Freeway was more than 50% vacant 
from the time of its completion in 1990 until it was purchased in December, 
1993, by Bedford Property Investors Inc., a Northern California real estate 
investment trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased occupancy of the 100,000-square-foot building has coincided with the 
dwindling availability of quality office space in Ventura County, reports Bill 
Kiefer of Grubb & Ellis Co., the structure's leasing agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owner's biggest boost came when Ventura-based Kinko's Service Corp. 
took more than two of the building's six floors. Other new tenants include a 
dental practice, an accounting firm and a publishing concern.

VENTURA COUNTY ROUNDUP: REFINANCING ACTIVITY IN COUNTY DECLINES 82% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rising interest rates have reduced home refinancing activity in Ventura County 
to less than one-fifth its level of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The drastic turnaround saw only 509 refinanced loans made in the county in 
October, down 82% from October, 1993, according to Dataquick Information 
Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The slowdown in Ventura County is in line with a statewide decline of 84% in 
refinancings. In fact, statewide activity in such loans is at its lowest level 
in more than five years, according to Dataquick. 
</P>
<P>
 With rates on 30-year mortgages in the 9% range, compared with about 7% a year 
ago, many homeowners have seen the window close on their chance to lower their 
monthly payments by restructuring their loans, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decline was expected, but it still hit the lending industry hard," said 
Donald H. Cohn, Dataquick's chief executive. "Most lending institutions have 
been trying to make up for some of the decline by increasing loan activity in 
other categories, especially loans to home buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he noted, the rise in interest rates is starting to put a damper on real 
estate sales too. Rates of all kinds are climbing due to money-tightening moves 
by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's actions could slow the long economic recovery, which has been 
considered more vulnerable in California than elsewhere, Cohn added. "There 
have been a lot of layoffs (in the state), and more are expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, about 30% of all loans made by lending institutions are home 
refinancings. A year ago, refinancing accounted for nearly 70% of loans 
nationwide. Last month, Dataquick reported, that share was down to less than 
27%. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.9% nationwide in 
October, up from 6.7% a year ago. That means the average monthly mortgage 
payment on a $135,000 refinanced loan was $1,080.93 in October, compared with 
$874.67 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Dataquick analyst John Karevoll said he believes that it will be several 
months before trends in the real estate market become clear. "Home buyers in 
October, November and December tend to be professionals who expect to rent the 
property out or fix it up for resale," he said. "These people aren't as 
concerned as the general public about mortgage rates." 
</P>
<P>
 By early next year, the public's mood should be evident, Karevoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of new and used homes in Ventura County totaled 810 in October, down 
from 925 in September and practically unchanged from 809 in October, 1993.

VENTURA COUNTY ROUNDUP: PHYSICIANS CLINICAL LAB CLOSES NEWBURY PARK SITE

<P>
 The company that acquired the Newbury Park medical testing center of Damon 
Corp. earlier this year has closed the facility and moved its operations to 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians Clinical Laboratory Inc., which purchased Damon's California 
operations from Corning Inc. in April, has started work at its new Southern 
California regional hub lab in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the former Newbury Park lab, another Physicians testing unit in 
Glendale has also been closed, the company reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The new 100,000-square-foot regional center is large enough to accommodate 
future acquisitions, Physicians said. The complex "will enable the company to 
sustain and further the growth we have experienced to date," said Nathan L. 
Headley, Physicians' president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians, based in Sacramento, claims to be the fastest-growing company in 
the clinical laboratory industry. It has three full-service labs and numerous 
other labs and patient service centers throughout California.

VENTURA COUNTY ROUNDUP: OXNARD BUSINESSES URGED TO USE GTE RIVAL AT & T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Jack Searles

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard's business community welcomed GTE California with open arms in March 
when the telephone company announced that it was converting the never-used 
Chevron USA building into a customer-service center that would bring hundreds 
of jobs to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce is urging its members to give their 
long-distance and local toll-call business to a GTE rival, AT & T. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Thousand Oaks-based GTE is concerned, the long-distance business is 
no loss. The company doesn't carry those calls. But, along with AT & T, MCI and 
numerous other companies, it will begin vying for toll-call revenues when the 
toll service is decontrolled Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Facciano, the Oxnard chamber's executive director, has sent a letter to 
members saying the group has formed "a new alliance with a company we should 
all feel proud to be associated with: AT & T." He wrote that the deal, called 
Profit by Association, will offer members special discounts on business 
long-distance services, including toll calls. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the letter, AT & T will offer members rates about 50% lower than 
they now pay on toll calls in the Greater Los Angeles Area. Profit by 
Association will give members another 5% discount, Facciano wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only does AT & T provide the best quality, highest reliability, fastest 
call completion time, and round-the-clock service and support, they reward your 
loyalty with no-cost Value-Added programs that enhance your operations and 
improve your bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 GTE spokesman Larry Cox says he's surprised that GTE, the main telephone 
utility in Oxnard, didn't get an equal boost from the chamber. "Certainly, our 
new center will be a big plus for the city's economy," he said. "As for rates, 
we're offering business customers plans that are at least as reasonable as AT & 
T's." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox says GTE's new center, which will consolidate work formerly done at a 
number of offices throughout Southern California, will employ 500 workers by 
the end of December. "We'll probably have 800 people there by the end of next 
year," Cox added. "People laid off at other sites will get a chance to transfer 
there, but I expect we'll be hiring several hundred people to work in Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 Facciano, who formerly was manager of the Sears, Roebuck store in Oxnard, said 
there's a simple reason why he bypassed GTE's toll-call program. "They haven't 
made us a pitch. AT & T did."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Benton Oil & Gas Co., an Oxnard-based petroleum exploration and production 
company, said it has sold a 10% working interest in its West Cote Blanche Bay 
Field in Louisiana to Tenneco Ventures of Houston for $6.2 million and future 
consideration of up to $3.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale, involving about 4 million barrels of proved reserves, leaves Benton 
with a 32% interest in the natural gas field, Benton said.As part of the 
transaction, Benton said it is finalizing a $10-million working capital 
facility with the Tenneco / Encap gas fund secured by Benton's domestic oil and 
gas reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale and working capital facility provide the company "additional 
financial flexibility and an expanded capital base upon which to continue to 
grow our domestic operations," said Alex E. Benton, chief executive of Benton 
Oil & Gas.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: VOLKSWAGEN READIES NEW BEETLE FOR U.S. MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An updated version of the famed Volkswagen Beetle designed by the German car 
maker's Simi Valley design studio will be on the market by the end of the 
decade, Volkswagen A.G. recently announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of the car and the number that will be produced were not disclosed, 
but the company said that the United States will be one of the primary markets 
for the new car. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're over the moon," said Charles Ellwood, head of the Simi Valley studio, 
using an expression imported from his native England. "It's the first time that 
something to come out of this studio will hit the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Beetle design, dubbed Concept One, was unveiled at the North American 
International Auto Show in Detroit last January. The prototype design that the 
Simi Valley team came up with maintains the bulbous profile of its forebearer, 
but unlike the original the new version will have a water-cooled engine in the 
front of the car, and will feature anti-lock brakes and air bags. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Beetle sales peaked at 367,607 in 1969, and the model was discontinued in 
this country in 1977. Last year, Volkswagen's sales in the United States dipped 
below 50,000 units.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: THE RIGHT START TO SELL CHILDREN'S WEAR DIGEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Right Start Inc., a Westlake Village catalogue marketer of children's 
products, said it has agreed to sell its Children's Wear Digest business. Terms 
of the cash transaction were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer is a private investor group led by Philip Klaus Jr., president of 
Children's Wear Digest. The deal is expected to close by Dec. 31. As a result 
of the sale, The Right Start will post a one-time, pretax charge of about $1.5 
million for its fiscal second quarter that ended Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's Wear Digest specializes in upscale, brand-name clothes for kids up 
to 12. The Right Start acquired the catalogue two years ago, but the company 
said it now wants to devote its resources to its retail expansion, and proceeds 
from the sale will provide the funds needed to continue adding new stores. It 
expects to have 12 retail outlets open by the end of the year, up from five 
before beginning the expansion last month.

PILLARS OF THE COMMUNITY; LEADING THE WAY IN NORTHRIDGE MALL'S RECOVERY, SEARS 
AND BROADWAY REPORT IMPROVED SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For local residents, the Northridge Fashion Center shopping mall has stood as 
a glaring symbol of the January earthquake. Now, eleven months later, two of 
the shopping mall's anchor tenants have reopened just in time for the holiday 
season, and to serve as a milestone in the gradual rebirth of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, shoppers have had little trouble finding their way back to the 
Northridge mall's Sears, Roebuck & Co. and The Broadway department stores, 
which reopened last month after extensive repairs and remodeling. Managers of 
the two stores are reporting sales increases over this time last year and are 
hoping that the fancy new facades and upgraded merchandise mixes -- changes 
that were already planned -- will be an extra lure for customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the January temblor, the Northridge Fashion Center was one of Los 
Angeles' most successful shopping malls. But the 24-year-old mall a half-mile 
from the epicenter suffered such severe damage that the rest of the 210 center 
stores are not expected to reopen until at least March. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent weekday, Sears was busy with holiday shoppers, many of whom said 
that they'd been so busy with their own earthquake repairs that they had put 
off shopping until now. Others said they had traveled to malls in Woodland 
Hills, Glendale and Thousand Oaks and were now pleased to have their old 
shopping mall -- a small part of it anyway -- back in business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful," said Marise Moore as she strolled through Sears. Perhaps, 
but her husband, Jack, added that it's "still the same old Sears." The couple 
were shopping for Christmas gifts, as well as light switches and other items 
for the quake repairs they'd only recently begun at their Granada Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We missed Sears," said Jack Moore. "It's a hangout, with all the tools." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Nolasco of Northridge said the store's reopening was timely because he 
needed replacement parts for his Sears washing machine and refrigerator. "It's 
really nice to be back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Sears spent $8 million rebuilding the Northridge store. It now has a modern, 
cream-colored exterior with pillars by the entrance. Inside, stockrooms were 
reduced drastically in size to make way for expanded apparel, cosmetics, shoe 
and electronics departments. The shopping area has grown to three floors from 
two, and aisles have been widened. The store's general manager Ed Tiritilli 
calls the new design "shopper friendly," and has turned the store into a model 
for new design and merchandising concepts that are being implemented throughout 
the nationwide chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge store, now one of the largest in the Sears chain, has also 
beefed up its staff to about 400 workers, 70 more than before the quake. But 
the biggest change is the expansion in the clothing sections, which reflect 
Sears' strategy to get away from being just the place shoppers go to buy power 
drills and washing machines. Sales at the store have shown double-digit gains 
over this time last year, Tiritilli said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce and Kim Dials, a mother and daughter from Valencia who came to the 
Northridge Sears to find a table as a Christmas gift for Joyce's husband, said 
they liked the wider aisles and spread-out merchandise. "You can get in and out 
without pushing," said Joyce. "And your kids, you can find them in the racks." 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the Broadway, customers toting bright red holiday bags whisked through 
the store. The Broadway's parent company, Carter Hawley Hale Stores, also used 
its rebuilt Northridge store as a showcase for its more upscale look, with a 
sleek facade of white bricks and aqua-colored trim. 
</P>
<P>
 Main aisles are now shaped in large ovals that lap the store, while high-tech 
ceiling lights and a large skylight on the third floor give a feeling of 
openness. Guest stations that provide everything from an automatic teller 
machine to a bridal registry are on each level. A touch-screen directory shows 
the locations of various products, departments and restrooms. A children's play 
area features computers, toys, drawing boards and an animatronic talking 
redwood tree. The remodeled Broadway store also eliminated furniture and 
electronics departments to make room for more fashions and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Rudnick of Reseda, who has done little shopping since the earthquake, 
said she was so happy to have the local Broadway back that she showed up for 
the Nov. 4 reopening, only to return the next day with her husband. On 
subsequent visits she took relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Giltner traveled from Bakersfield to see the new Broadway, and waited 
with his 14-month-old granddaughter while his wife shopped for gifts. "She just 
deposited me here," he said with a laugh, adding that he was grateful that the 
new play area amused his granddaughter enough to keep her from running in the 
aisles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been shopping here for 20 some-odd years," said Dick White of Granada 
Hills, who wandered Broadway while his wife shopped for her own Christmas 
present. "It's better than it's ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 Retailing analysts said the remodeled stores in Northridge would serve as 
showcases for the chains. Broadway "put everything into that store so it would 
be cutting edge," said Edward F. Johnson, director of the New York investment 
research firm Johnson Redbook Service. "They've been forced to redo. Now 
they'll use these as tests." 
</P>
<P>
 But some industry experts warned against placing too much importance on the 
initial customer response. Though both stores report sales increases, Richard 
Giss, a retail consultant with accounting firm Deloitte & Touche in Los 
Angeles, noted that "a year ago it was still a really soft retailing 
environment in Southern California. So that's not a strong period to compare it 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Giss also said it might be difficult for the stores to sustain customer 
traffic until the rest of the Northridge mall comes back. "To have two anchors 
reopen without the specialty stores, that's still a tough environment to 
operate in." 
</P>
<P>
 And amid all the holiday glow about having their neighborhood mall partly back 
in operation, a few customer complaints surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Lee of Northridge said she was glad the Broadway was open again, but 
because the only other store, Sears, was on the opposite side of the mall and 
the corridors of the mall remain closed, she had to drive around the block and 
park again to get to Sears. "It's just an inconvenience," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean McMurdo of North Hills said she was lost in the redesigned Broadway. And 
she still has to drive to Glendale to buy her favorite coffee because the 
coffee concession in the Northridge mall is out of commission. Another shopper, 
who didn't want her name used, said her recent trip to Broadway was her first 
to any department store since the January earthquake. She confessed to being "a 
little nervous" that despite the repairs another earthquake would do just as 
much damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Store officials admit that earthquake jitters could linger. Two mall parking 
garages that caved in during the quake will not be rebuilt until February and 
March. One garage was the scene of one of the most searing images from the 
earthquake, when a janitor had to be rescued after being trapped under tons of 
fallen concrete. Even though the new garages will be sturdier, Sears' Tiritilli 
acknowledged that consumers might require some convincing about their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the earthquake is still fresh in the minds of local residents, 
Tiritilli maintained that "we still have a great market. We believe we're going 
to do extremely well for the next 20 years."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: LTC SELLS $83 MILLION IN COMPLEX SECURITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LTC Properties Inc., an Oxnard real estate investment trust specializing in 
long-term care and other health-care facilities, has sold $83 million of 
complex, mortgage-backed securities known as real estate mortgage investment 
conduits (REMICs). 
</P>

 The REMICs were part of a $127.7-million package of the securities that were 
ranked according to their credit ratings. The REMICs sold by the trust were the 
highest-rated in the group, and have an average yield of 8.9%. LTC said it 
would use the proceeds to repay debt and to fund existing mortgage loan 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining $44.7 million in lower-rated REMICs, with yields of about 11% to 
11.25%, were retained by LTC.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: STOCKBROKER IS ADVISING HIS INVESTORS TO 
TOUGH IT OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the stock market taking its lumps recently and interest rates taking off, 
what is a veteran Ventura County stockbroker advising his clients to do with 
their money these days? 
</P>
<P>
 Broker Glenn Fitzgerald, 48, of the Ventura office of Dean Witter, advises 
many investors to tough it out, even adding to their stock holdings in line 
with the dollar-cost-averaging philosophy that Fitzgerald has advocated for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to convince people it's true, but a weak market can be beneficial" 
Fitzgerald says, because "it offers a chance to buy stocks at reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the stock market recovers, as it always has in the past, you're in a 
position to make higher profits." He mentions utilities as one stock group that 
he believes has been oversold. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just one strategy. Another, especially favored by Fitzgerald's older 
clients who are living on fixed incomes, is to take advantage of rising 
interest rates by moving into bonds, money market funds or U. S. Treasury 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Fitzgerald recalls, two-year Treasury notes yielded only about 3% 
annually. Today, he says, one can purchase such notes offering a 7% yield. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bond market continues heading south, the notes' market value could 
decline, too. But in two years, when the paper matures, holders will get their 
investment back, besides enjoying a tidy return on their money, Fitzgerald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald was 26 and just out of the Air Force when he joined Dean Witter in 
1972. In addition to selling securities, he's now assistant manager of the 
Ventura office. The unit moved eastward from downtown to Victoria Avenue in the 
late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early days, people in the county tended to put their money into oil 
industry stocks. It was an understandable approach in view of the local 
importance of oil in those days." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the number of oil producers and oil-field service firms in the county 
dwindled, Fitzgerald received fewer and fewer orders for oil stocks. "In those 
days as now, my customers have tended to invest in companies and industries 
they're familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, his customers are more likely to favor the securities of 
biotechnology or computer-related companies, which represent fields now gaining 
prominence in the county's economy. "There have been other changes. Some of my 
clients are quite elderly now. They were in their 60s when I started out, and 
many of them have stayed with me. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, of course, the investment mix has changed a lot. The number of mutual 
funds has exploded. More and more, people are buying them instead of individual 
stocks and bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most significant development of all, Fitzgerald believes, is 
investors' increased knowledge and sophistication. "There's been a vast 
improvement in financial publications that cover companies and the economy. I 
offer guidance if I'm asked to, but many of my customers do a lot of their own 
research." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald sums up his long-term view of the market: "Let's face it, a year 
ago, things felt a lot better than they do now. But five years from now, I'm 
sure the people who've stayed with it will be glad they did."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: DATRON SELLS 2ND OF 2 LINES PRODUCED IN 
SIMI 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Datron Systems Inc., which last year closed a plant in Camarillo, has sold the 
second of two switch product lines that were produced at the firm's facility in 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale, completed last month, will take Datron out of making 
electromechanical switches for the military, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 William L. Stephan, Datron's chief financial officer, said the purchaser, K & 
L Microwave, a unit of Dover Corp., paid $1.1 million for the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a small operation," he said. "If there are any layoffs, they will be 
minimal." 
</P>
<P>
 The sale was part of a program to reduce Datron's dependence on defense 
contracts, Stephan said. He said the Simi Valley plant has 220 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Datron, which produces satellite ground stations and high-tech radios, moved 
its corporate headquarters from Simi Valley to Escondido last year.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: DEVELOPERS PAY $100 FOR SITE -- WITH A 
CATCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to buy half a block in downtown Oxnard for $100? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the deal two developers are getting -- but there's a catch.They had to 
promise the seller, the city of Oxnard, that they'll build 28 townhouses on the 
site for low- and moderate-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 Partners Dennis Howarth, a Ventura businessman, and David Ball, an Orange 
County architect, will be required to give the land back if they fail to offer 
the units at prices ranging from about $94,000 to $127,000 each, according to 
Alex Herrera, the city's assistant planner. 
</P>
<P>
 The city paid about $1 million in the late 1980s to buy and clear the 1.3-acre 
parcel between 6th and 7th streets and west of B Street. People who were living 
in houses and apartments there were relocated. "The area was blighted," Herrera 
said. "It had to be cleared so decent housing could be provided." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera said city officials, who gave the sale final approval last month, 
estimate that the land is worth only about $100 to the buyers "when you 
consider the construction cost and the (sale) prices they're being held to." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the Oxnard Farmers' Market, currently held on the property, will 
be moved, and that construction will start early next year.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: EMPLOYERS ARE REPORTED UPBEAT ABOUT 
HIRING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County employers are upbeat about their hiring plans for the first 
quarter of 1995, according to a quarterly survey by Manpower Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased staffing is expected by 27% of the county's companies, while 7% plan 
cutbacks, the study shows. The rest of the firms are unsure or plan no changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, Manpower found that 17% of the county's large employers 
planned to increase payrolls and 3% expected layoffs. A year ago, 13% predicted 
increased hiring and 13% forecast decreases. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring prospects in the county will be brightest this winter in manufacturing, 
transportation, public utilities, wholesaling and retailing, the survey showed. 
Layoffs are expected in health care and other service fields.

HMOS PRESCRIBE COST-CUT CURE FOR WORKERS' COMP ILLS; WELLPOINT, HEALTH NET AND 
CAREAMERICA ARE EXPANDING INTO INDUSTRIAL INJURY FIELD, TOUTING LOWER EMPLOYER 
PREMIUMS. SOME SEE AN AWKWARD FIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health-maintenance organizations, which in the past 10 years have dramatically 
changed medical care in California, are now focusing their cost-cutting skills 
on the state's $11-billion workers' compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Promising substantial savings for employers and higher-quality care for 
injured employees, three Woodland Hills companies have rushed into the workers' 
comp business this year: WellPoint Health Networks, the managed-care subsidiary 
of Blue Cross; Health Net, the state's second-largest HMO; and CareAmerica 
Health Plans, an HMO subsidiary of Burbank-based UniHealth America. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three companies has either bought a workers' compensation insurer 
or formed alliances with insurers, and all three are busy assembling networks 
of workers' comp doctors. Their strategy involves negotiating volume discounts 
with doctors and avoiding unnecessary medical procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 By supervising the medical treatment of injured workers, the Woodland Hills 
HMOs and others across the state say they can cut as much as 30% from the 
estimated $3.5 billion spent treating work-related injuries in California each 
year. In the process, HMOs hope to wrest business away from conventional 
insurance companies that have dominated the industry for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But skeptics say HMOs will learn that the methods that worked well cutting 
private medical costs will be much less effective reforming the thorny workers' 
compensation system. "We're not worried in the least" about competition from 
HMOs, said Stanley Zax, chief executive of Zenith Insurance Co., a Woodland 
Hills insurer that collected $245 million in workers' compensation premiums 
last year. "I don't believe HMO competition guarantees the lowest net cost to 
buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of HMO-like workers' compensation plans are in place so far. 
Day Runner Inc., a Fullerton maker of calendar date books, was the first 
company to sign up for WellPoint's workers' comp plan last January. With 375 
employees at its Fullerton facility, Day Runner cringed as its workers' comp 
insurance premiums hit $440,000 in 1993 and were set to jump to $550,000 this 
year, said Personnel Director Lee Coffey. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its deal with WellPoint, Day Runner employees who strain their backs or 
sprain their ankles are sent to the same medical clinic as before, but 
WellPoint trimmed Day Runner's medical costs 25% by negotiating cheaper rates 
at that clinic. WellPoint also reviews each case with an eye toward eliminating 
unnecessary treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Since switching to WellPoint, Day Runner's workers' comp premiums 
dipped to $350,000 this year. "It's a remarkable change," said Coffey, who 
added that his company expects to renew its policy with WellPoint at another 
20% discount next year due to improved safety conditions at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, WellPoint has workers' comp contracts with about 50 employers, ranging 
from grocery stores to auto wreckers. CareAmerica expects to begin selling its 
first workers' comp plan early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net is still looking for the first direct sale of its workers' 
compensation plan to an employer. But through alliances with four insurance 
companies, Health Net will be paid about $20 million next year for supervising 
medical costs on their workers' compensation programs, said Tamara Watt, vice 
president of workers' compensation at Health Net. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts across the country are watching the developments in 
California, where employers have long complained about skyrocketing workers' 
comp insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the state adopted a number of reforms designed to stop fraud and 
abuse in the state's workers' comp system, which requires employers to pay for 
the medical care and lost wages of employees who are injured on the job. But 
relatively little has been done to control actual medical costs, which account 
for about 40 cents of each $1 in premiums collected by insurers. The reforms 
and opportunities for further cost-cutting set the stage for the HMO invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last January, WellPoint spent $154 million to buy UniCare Financial, an Irvine 
workers' compensation insurer with annual premium revenue of $135 million. In 
August, CareAmerica spent $95 million to buy Heath Cal, a San Francisco insurer 
with $130 million in annual revenues. Meanwhile, Health Net formed alliances 
with insurers including AIG Claim Services Inc., a New York-based firm that 
collected $545 million in premiums in California last year and is the largest 
privately owned workers' compensation insurer in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In making these deals, the Woodland Hills HMOs hope to pocket some of the 
savings they generate by cutting costs in existing workers' comp programs. But 
some industry experts say combining HMOs' methods and workers' compensation 
objectives will be a difficult fit. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to avoid unnecessary expenses, HMOs often take weeks to review cases 
before authorizing patients to see medical specialists. But in workers' 
compensation, such delays can be costly for employers, who have to hire 
replacement workers and reimburse injured employees for lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a recent study by the California Workers' Compensation Institute, a 
nonprofit entity funded by insurance companies, found that medical bills for 
similar injuries were 21% less in HMOs than under conventional workers' 
compensation medical plans. But the study also found that conventional workers' 
compensation injury treatments are concluded 44% faster than in HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 HMOs "say what we're trying to do is to get this person well at the lowest 
possible cost," said Ed Woodward, president of the San Francisco-based 
institute. "Workers' compensation goes for intensive services early on . . . 
because the total cost is cheaper that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential problem for HMOs is that state law allows employers to 
control where their injured workers go for treatment only for the first 30 days 
following an injury. After that, workers can go almost anywhere for treatment, 
and that leaves HMOs virtually powerless to control long-term medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Monte Horn, 35, works as a painter at Pharmavite Corp., a vitamin manufacturer 
in Mission Hills. After slicing his thumb last month while repairing a ceramic 
floor tile, Horn was whisked by his boss to a nearby clinic, where he received 
three stitches. Horn was happy with the care he received, and wasn't even aware 
that his company's insurance policy was a workers' compensation plan supervised 
by WellPoint. But if the injury had been "something serious, I probably would 
have called one of those (workers' compensation) attorneys, just to protect 
myself," Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a newly created state program, insurers and HMOs can become certified 
"health-care organizations," or HCOs, that are allowed to control where 
employees receive care for up to a year. But employees must voluntarily enroll 
in these plans, and some say there is little incentive for employees to do so. 
Of the three Woodland Hills companies, only WellPoint said it plans to apply 
for HCO certification. 
</P>
<P>
 To try to keep patients happy -- and away from workers' compensation attorneys 
-- HMOs rely on case managers to make sure injured workers are treated well. 
And HMOs also pay doctors bonuses for keeping patients from leaving the HMO 
doctor network. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If you deliver good quality medical care up front, you eliminate the need to 
have cases litigated and you cut down on the disability side," said Russ 
Leatherby, chief executive officer of UniCare, the insurer acquired by 
WellPoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the potential pitfalls for HMOs, their sheer size gives them a 
powerful weapon for controlling costs and winning more customers. HMOs already 
have group health insurance contracts with thousands of employers, and one in 
every three state residents is an HMO member. So HMOs can negotiate volume 
discounts with doctors and hospitals. And now, as HMOs pick and choose 
occupational health clinics to contract with, those clinics must agree to 
discounts or risk losing patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the good old days, individuals made the decision where to go for service," 
said Jerry Torgerson, vice president in charge of workers' compensation at 
CareAmerica. As HMOs move into workers' comp, he said, "the patient volume will 
be increasingly channeled to networks of providers." 
</P>
<P>
 To be part of the Health Net, WellPoint and CareAmerica workers' compensation 
networks, Healthline Medical Group in Van Nuys agreed to reduce its fees by 15% 
and to adhere to so-called case rates that specify fees for the most common 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 For a finger injury, Healthline might bill a conventional insurance company 
$200 to more than $1,000, depending on the amount of treatment rendered. Under 
its workers' compensation contract with Health Net, however, Healthline is paid 
$560 for every finger injury that does not require surgery, with no exceptions, 
said Dr. Emmett Berg, a medical director at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg said there are at least five industrial medicine clinics within two miles 
of his location, but "most will be out of business" in a few years, he said, 
because they will be left out of the doctor networks being assembled by HMO and 
managed health care plans. "We will stay in business if we get the volume, but 
if we don't, we're out of business too," Berg said.

ENERGY FIRMS REACH ACCORD, TO MERGE FOR $950 MILLION; ACQUISITIONS: SURPRISE 
ANNOUNCEMENT COMES AFTER CALIFORNIA ENERGY SWEETENS BID FOR MAGMA POWER TO $39 
A SHARE. 
</P>

<P>
 In a surprising turnabout that cost a handful of overeager traders about $1 
million, rival geothermal producers California Energy Co. and Magma Power Co. 
said Monday that they agreed to merge after California Energy raised its offer 
to $39 a share, or $950 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which would create the world's largest independent geothermal 
producer, stunned several Wall Street observers. Many thought that San 
Diego-based Magma Power had successfully fought off California Energy's hostile 
takeover effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Friday, Omaha-based California Energy said it was calling off its 
$38.50-a-share, $925-million hostile tender offer for Magma Power after failing 
to enlist the support of Dow Chemical Co., which owns 21% of Magma Power 
shares, and B.C. McCabe Trust, which owns 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dow, Magma's largest shareholder, took a decisive role over the weekend to 
persuade the two companies to forge a merger agreement, California Energy 
Chairman David Sokol said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow arranged a Saturday meeting in New York between Sokol and Magma Power 
Chairman Paul Pankratz and Chief Executive Ralph Boeker, Sokol said. After 
California Energy sweetened its offer, the two sides came up with an agreement 
that was unanimously approved early Monday by Magma Power's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms call for a new tender offer to commence Dec. 9 in which California 
Energy will pay $39 for each Magma Power share in a combination of $28.50 cash 
and $10.50 in California Energy stock. The acquirer will pay cash for the first 
50.3% of Magma Power shares tendered. Sokol said California Energy will attempt 
to pay cash for the rest of Magma's shares if financing can be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Dow Chief Financial Officer Enrique C. Falla said he was 
delighted by the agreement. He was not available to comment further on Dow's 
role in the pact. Pankratz and Boeker, both former Dow executives, were 
unavailable for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Daniele Seitz of UBS Securities said Magma Power was forced belatedly 
to accept the California Energy bid after failing to elicit "a big, fat premium 
or a white knight, which never showed up." 
</P>
<P>
 While analysts generally viewed the offer as fair for Magma Power 
shareholders, some, including Michael Cha of J.P. Morgan Securities, lamented 
the fact that the two companies didn't announce an agreement earlier Monday or 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, owners of about 100,000 Magma Power shares lost about $1 million by 
selling their stock in private transactions early Monday at about $28 a share 
-- the price when the takeover bid was launched in September -- figuring 
Friday's news of the termination of tender offer would cause share prices to 
fall, Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Official trading of both companies' stock was suspended at the market's 
opening Monday and resumed after the merger was announced at 9:30 a.m. EST. 
Magma Power shares closed up $1.875 at $37.375 on the Nasdaq, while California 
Energy stock closed down 87.5 cents at $15.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger would create a company with $400 million in revenue, producing 500 
megawatts of power in the Imperial Valley and Mammoth Lakes areas. The two 
firms together have 550 megawatts of geothermal power capacity under 
construction in the Philippines and Indonesia, with the bulk of their growth 
prospects in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 Geothermal power is produced from steam energy given off by currents of 
superheated fluids that exist a mile or more below the Earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the status of Magma Power's 320 employees -- 30 at Magma's headquarters 
in San Diego and 290 at its Imperial Valley energy plants -- Sokol said only 
Pankratz and Boeker are resigning. All other Magma Power employees "have jobs 
if they want them," he said.

DERLAN EXPANDS IN SANTA ANA'S ENTERPRISE ZONE; AEROSPACE: THE CANADIAN COMPANY 
IS ADDING 60 JOBS AND MOVING THREE OF ITS SOUTHLAND OPERATIONS TO FACTORY IT 
BOUGHT RECENTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Aerospace and Southern California have been a drain on its earnings, but 
Derlan Industries is betting on a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of Santa Ana's enterprise zone, the Canadian aerospace and 
specialty manufacturer recently bought Energy Container Corp., the aircraft 
fuel tanks division of BFM Aerospace Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase kept 110 jobs in Santa Ana, and Toronto-based Derlan is adding 60 
jobs as it consolidates three other small aerospace firms it owns into about 
260,000 square feet of space in the enterprise zone. That will enable the 
company to receive state tax advantages and other economic incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Snyders, senior vice president for Derlan in Santa Ana, said the 
enterprise zone was a factor in the decision, as was the hearty supply of 
skilled workers in the area. Also, he said, Derlan got a great deal on a 
seven-year lease from Santa Ana-based BFM Aerospace, which no longer has any 
operations but still owns the 12-acre property on East Dyer Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Snyders would not give financial details of the lease or the 
acquisition of BFM's business, he said that "everybody was happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyders said Derlan's Santa Ana operations will have about $35 million in 
annual sales. Companywide, Derlan had revenue of about $310 million last year, 
but the corporation lost $43 million because of a write-down of its aerospace 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see any remarkable upturn in the military market," Snyders said, 
"but we still think we have some opportunities, especially in foreign 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we view the commercial aerospace market as poised for a rebound." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Derlan's expansion in Santa Ana is a small but positive step for 
Orange County, which has lost thousands of aerospace jobs and figures to lose 
several thousand more next year when Hughes Aircraft closes its plant in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have taken (the jobs) to Arizona and Connecticut," where Derlan 
has other aerospace operations, said Bonnie Birch, Santa Ana's economic 
development specialist. Instead, she said, Derlan is creating jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
 The fuel tanks business in Santa Ana that Derlan bought was the last of the 
divisions of BFM, whose New York-based investors decided to get out of the 
aerospace industry. Two years ago, BFM shut down a separate division under the 
same roof that made control rods for nuclear submarines, laying off about 280 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Derlan is consolidating three other businesses it owns in Southern California 
into the Santa Ana site: American Safety Flight Systems, a Glendale maker of 
oxygen systems for commercial jets; Radiant Illumination in North Hollywood, 
which makes lighting systems for aircraft, and Thiem Industries, a Torrance 
maker of precision metal components for commercial and military markets. 
Corporate Consolidation 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto-based Derlan Industries, an aerospace and specialty manufacturer, will 
consolidate in Santa Ana's enterprise zone three small firms it owns. The move 
will enable Derlan to receive tax advantages and other economic incentives.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: LASER PRECISION SAYS 90% OF STOCK TENDERED IN DANISH 
MERGER DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laser Precision Corp. said Monday that 90.1% of its common stock has been 
tendered in an acquisition offer by GN Great Nordic Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of Laser Precision's stock had to be tendered, at a price of $8 a 
share, by Dec. 2 for the merger to be finalized.At that price, the merger would 
be worth an estimated $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company would not comment on the deal or on a lawsuit filed in Orange 
County Superior Court Nov. 10 by shareholder Joseph J. Nicholas. In the suit, 
Nicholas alleges that Laser Precision's board did not act in the interest of 
the shareholders when it entered acquisition talks with the Danish 
telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's Nasdaq trading, Laser Precision's stock closed at $7.75 a share, 
down 6 cents.

CIBA TO MOVE MIAMI FACILITY TO ANAHEIM; OPERATIONS: AIRPLANE PARTS MAKER SAYS 
CONSOLIDATION WILL NOT BRING ANY NEW JOBS. 
</P>

<P>
 Ciba Composites, a division of Swiss pharmaceutical giant Ciba-Geigy 
International AG, said Monday it is moving one of its manufacturing facilities 
from Miami to Anaheim.  
</P>
<P>
 The Miami operation produces a material called honeycomb core, which is used 
in the production of airplane floorboards.All of the other materials used to 
build floorboards are already made at the factory in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciba spokeswoman Donna Roos said the company is consolidating its 
manufacturing operations because both the Miami and Anaheim plants have been 
underutilized as the defense industry downsizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity came in August when Engelhard/ICC, a maker of high-performance 
air-conditioning systems, made an $8-million offer to purchase the Miami 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also researching new technologies that apply to the development 
of honeycomb core. "It makes sense to have the manufacturing here as well," 
Roos said, "because the research and development all goes on in Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 The move, however, will bring no new jobs to Orange County. Ciba's 60 Miami 
employees will stay on there with Engelhard/ICC when it moves in. The company's 
current Anaheim staff will take over responsibility for the honeycomb core 
manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift of manufacturing operations from Miami to Anaheim will take place 
over the next two years, Ciba said.

INSIDER GROUP COUNTERS OFFER FOR BIG O TIRES; ACQUISITION: SENIOR MANAGERS AND 
FRANCHISE HOLDERS BID $62 MILLION IN ATTEMPT TO STAVE OFF TAKEOVER BY AKH CO. 
OF ANAHEIM.

<P>
 An offer by AKH Co., an Anaheim-based chain of retail tire stores, to buy 
competitor Big O Tires Inc. has been countered by a group of senior managers 
and franchise holders, Big O said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The insider group has offered to buy Big O Tires Inc. for $18.50 a share, or 
$62 million, the company said.When privately held AKH made its offer in 
November, terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 John Siipola, Big O's chairman, said the buyout proposal is being sent to the 
board of directors' investment committee, which was formed in June after a 
proxy fight forced the company to consider alternatives for enhancing 
shareholder value. 
</P>
<P>
 Horst Mehlfeldt, an investment committee representative and board member, said 
that both the management offer and the AKH proposal will be evaluated.

 "It is too early to know how this offer will impact other alternatives, 
including the interest expressed by AKH Co.," Mehlfeldt said, adding that AKH 
has already started to review Big O documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest offer came from a group led by Steven Cloward, Big O's president 
and chief executive officer. In an April 11 proxy statement, the company said 
that Cloward owned 2.21% of Big O's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the wrangling over a possible sale of Big O, which is one of the largest 
independent retail tire and auto-service franchisers in North America, Big O's 
stock has risen 33% to a 52-week closing high of $17.25 a share on Nov. 2. It 
closed Monday at $17.19 a share, up $1.19, in Nasdaq trading on more than five 
times the average daily volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Big O, based in Englewood, Colo., has 370 stores in 18 states, primarily in 
the West and Midwest. The company also has 41 associated dealers in British 
Columbia. AKH has 130 retail tire stores in four Western states.

 Cam Data Systems Inc.: The Fountain Valley producer of inventory management 
and point-of-sale systems reported profit of $264,500, or 13 cents a share, for 
the fiscal year ended Sept. 30.That was down from earnings of $700,300, or 36 
cents a share, for the previous 12 months. Annual revenue was up 11% to $13.2 
million from $11.9 million. The company attributed the earnings decline to 
investments in the company's service and product development groups. 
Fourth-quarter profit fell to $41,000, or 2 cents a share, from $217,000, or 11 
cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. Three-month revenue rose 13%

STATORDYNE REMOVES 2 CONVERSION OFFICIALS; INVESTMENTS: THE ANAHEIM FIRM SEEKS 
TO SEPARATE ITS FUNCTIONS FROM A 22% SHAREHOLDER, WHICH HAS BEEN DROPPED FROM 
THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE.

 Statordyne Corp., in an effort to distance itself from Conversion Industries 
Inc., said Monday it has removed Randall M. Gates and Donald B. Clark from its 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates is Conversion's chief financial officer, and Clark is the current chief 
operating officer and former president of the Pasadena merchant bank that 
helped Anaheim-based Statordyne with its first public stock offering in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Statordyne, which makes electrical power enhancement systems, has also 
terminated a consulting agreement with Conversion under which Conversion 
advised Statordyne on matters ranging from legal services to employee benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the actions announced Monday, company officials said, 
Conversion no longer has any direct involvement with Statordyne. It is still a 
shareholder, owning 22% of Statordyne's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Statordyne spokesman Lance Ignon said that negative publicity about Conversion 
in recent weeks has "unfairly spilled over" and has damaged Statordyne's 
reputation with both investors and Wall Street brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Stock Exchange took the rare step of delisting Conversion's stock 
in mid-October because of unspecified disclosure issues. Since then, Statordyne 
has had problems of its own with Amex officials. On Oct. 27, Amex said it was 
reviewing the company's capitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of its latest fiscal year, Statordyne reported only $302,000 in 
capital. Amex requires minimum capital of $1 million to list a company's stock. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Ignon said Amex is still reviewing the company's listing on the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's trading, Statordyne's stock closed at $1.69 a share, unchanged.

NO INJURIES AS 3 QUAKES HIT VALLEY; AFTERSHOCKS: SEISMOLOGISTS RECORD THE 
TEMBLORS' MAGNITUDES AT 3.5, 3.0 AND 4.5 AND PLACE THE EPICENTERS EAST OF THE 
CITY OF SAN FERNANDO.

<P>
 Three aftershocks of the Jan. 17 Northridge quake bumped and rolled through 
the San Fernando Valley within minutes of each other Monday night, sending out 
shock waves felt throughout the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 No serious damage or injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The first quake, a magnitude 3.5, was centered three miles east northeast of 
San Fernando at 7:36 p.m., said Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
 The second, a magnitude 3.0, struck the same area at 7:48 p.m., followed 
seconds later by a magnitude 4.5, centered three miles east of San Fernando, 
Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblors occurred "in a very active part of the Northridge aftershock 
zone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She characterized the temblors as a "sequence within a sequence," meaning that 
while all of them were aftershocks of the Northridge quake, the smaller quakes 
Monday night were "foreshocks," a prelude to the third and biggest one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime we have a quake in Southern California, there is a 5% chance that it 
will be followed by a bigger quake," Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been a "fairly steady decline" in frequency of aftershocks 
since the initial series ended in January, such aftershocks could continue for 
at least two years, she said, "so it's not surprising to us at all to find this 
kind of activity going on right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's was the 57th aftershock of 4.0 or greater since January, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quakes were felt from the Santa Clarita Valley on the north to Venice and 
into southeastern Los Angeles County and westward through Ventura County to 
Oxnard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest quake emptied the 600-seat theater of the Television Academy of 
Arts and Sciences in North Hollywood, where several hundred people rushed out 
of a special Disney anniversary screening, said Jerry Ough, who was there. 
</P>
<P>
 Some theater patrons returned a few minutes later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor also shook up Christmas shopping crowds at Northridge Fashion 
Center, where repair work on heavy damage by the January quake is still under 
way. "The place was packed," one woman told television station KCAL. "When the 
earthquake hit, I just started shaking and everyone just headed for the doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Some reported the strongest quake as sharp. Others said it had a rolling, wavy 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma-Ruth Nehus of Granada Hills, a few miles from the epicenter, said the 
second aftershock felt much larger than the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like at least a 5.0 here. My chandelier was swinging at least eight 
inches," Nehus said. "We had $100,000 worth of damage from the last earthquake. 
I'm 70 years old I don't want to spend the rest of my life rebuilding the house 
from the earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said her house was not damaged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Winnetka, Pamela Castruita filled her flashlight with batteries and checked 
on her family's water supply as soon as the first shaker hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband thought I was nuts, but I was scared," said Castruita. "Then the 
next one hit and we all ran outside and checked with the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone service in the San Fernando Valley was briefly interrupted after the 
temblor but the problem was too many people trying to make calls, not 
mechanical damage to the system, said Linda Bonniksen, spokeswoman for Pacific 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone picks up the phone and we get heavy network congestion," said 
Bonniksen. "It happens after every earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of problems with any Metrolink trains or stations, said 
Peter Hidalgo, Metrolink spokesman. Because the temblor was less than a 5.0, 
"there will be no significant evaluation of the rail system."  
</P>
<P>
 "Only when it is 5.0 will all trains cease and all our inspectors inspect the 
entire 346-mile network, which takes about three hours to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two late evening trains, one traveling from Los Angeles to Santa Clarita, and 
the other from Los Angeles to San Bernardino, continued with no delays. 
Southern Pacific Railroad officials also reported no problems or delays in 
their schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Airport reported no interference with normal operations.

OFFICIALS GET NEW JOBS IN LAPD SHAKE-UP; POLICE: MORE THAN 12 MID- TO 
HIGH-LEVEL OFFICERS WILL CHANGE ASSIGNMENTS AS PART OF CHIEF WILLIAMS' 
CONTROVERSIAL REORGANIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 More than a dozen mid- to high-level Los Angeles Police Department officials 
will receive new assignments today in the next major phase of Chief Willie L. 
Williams' shake-up of the force, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the shifts merely formalize Williams' controversial announcement in 
September that he would reorganize the department, notably the installation of 
Deputy Chief Ronald Banks as the LAPD's second-highest-ranking official. 
Williams notified city council members of the shifts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although creation of a new position such as the one for Banks normally would 
require council approval, the announcements expected by Williams do not depend 
on council action. That is because of a top-level vacancy at the department, 
created when Williams abruptly demoted Assistant Chief Bernard Parks last fall 
-- a move that plunged the chief into the biggest controversy of his 2 
1/2-year-old administration. 
</P>
<P>
 To complete his reorganization, however, Williams will need to submit parts of 
the plan to the City Council. That is because Williams intends to change the 
structure of the Police Department from having two assistant chiefs to having 
three. The additional position will cost more money, and the council has the 
power to consider all funding requests. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Williams brings that part of his proposal to the council, he will 
forward it to a body that no longer includes a potentially difficult adversary. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a vocal critic of Williams, was 
sworn in as a county supervisor. Yaroslavsky chaired the council's Budget 
Committee, but his job change ensures that the Police Department will not have 
to confront him over Williams' reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Banks' promotion would be the most visible of the changes, it comes 
amid a host of shifting assignments. Tim McBride, the popular commanding 
officer of the LAPD's Air Support Division, will take over as the department's 
chief spokesman, a position vacated when Cmdr. David J. Gascon was promoted to 
deputy chief and took over responsibility for the department's expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of department captains also will be transferred, as will its 
highest-ranking woman. Detective Robert Kimball will move from Internal Affairs 
to Bunco-Forgery; he will swap jobs with Capt. Margaret York, the LAPD's 
highest-ranking woman, who will inherit the sensitive Internal Affairs post. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, Foothill Division Patrol Capt. Robert Gale has 
been reassigned to the West Valley Division. Gale, who arrived at Foothill just 
last March, will be replaced by Lt. George V. Aliano, a 30-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. John Moran, second in command of all Valley divisions, said he also 
expects to be reassigned to a new position within the next three weeks, but did 
not speculate about his new job or who would replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always tough to leave a nice assignment," said Moran, was oversaw the 
Valley Bureau's specialized gang, prostitution, auto theft, training and 
support units. 
</P>
<P>
 Gale, who could not be reached for comment, will fill the patrol captain 
position in West Valley, which was left vacant several months ago by Capt. 
Harlan Ward, who now works at the Valley Traffic division. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliano, who has spent the bulk of the last two years heading Valley narcotics, 
has worked a laundry list of assignments during his three decades with the 
LAPD, including a 12-year stint at the Los Angeles Police Protective League, 
where he served as president for 7 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 While anticipating a heavy work load as a patrol captain, Aliano said he looks 
forward to starting his new assignment. He will join Foothill Area Capt. Ronald 
Bergmann, who took over as commanding officer at the division in September.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very diverse community," Aliano said of the Foothill Division. "I'm 
going to do what I can as a patrol captain to ensure that not only my people 
but that the narcotics people have a lot of support, because it will definitely 
impact the gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Later this week, another round of changes could complete the reorganization, 
officials said. Those changes probably would include the promotion of Deputy 
Chief Bayan Lewis to the rank of assistant chief in charge of the LAPD's Office 
of Operations, which oversees 80% of all officers in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 That move would require council backing because Lewis would become the third 
assistant chief in a department only authorized for two.

TERMS OF ESTRANGEMENT; BURT REYNOLDS PLEADS POVERTY IN CUSTODY FIGHT WITH 
ACTRESS EX-WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

 Actor Burt Reynolds says he is financially down -- his net worth dropping from 
$7.5 million to $2 million in the hole in six months -- and until he can make a 
comeback, he can't afford the $15,000 a month he pays in child support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like every American, I'm having a cash-flow problem right now," Reynolds 
testified Monday at a custody and child-support hearing in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who made more than $43 million between 1988 and 1994, according to 
court records, is seeking a reduction in the support he pays for his adopted 
son Quinton, 6, whose custody he shares with his former wife, actress Loni 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The former spouses, whose bitter breakup two years ago generated tabloid 
headlines for months, entered the courtroom of Judge Robert M. Letteau through 
separate doors and maintained a chilly distance throughout the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson had no comment about the legal wrangling. She is scheduled to testify 
later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Reynolds achieved a minor victory, winning custody of Quinton for 
Christmas Day, his testimony about his finances was marked by alternating quips 
and lapses of memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "My IQ seems to have dropped 100 points since I got up here," the actor said 
during one particularly rigorous round of questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 He used his day on the witness stand to announce that he might be down, but 
he's not out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm down and I'm going to come back and when I come back, I hope that Quinton 
gets everything he can from me," the actor testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Reynolds said, he has no movie offers pending and little money 
trickling in from residuals.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have lots of plans. I don't have lots of offers."  
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, a former Florida State football player and show-biz stuntman, said 
he recently sold a home in North Carolina and took a second mortgage on his 
ranch in Jupiter, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned by Anderson's lawyer, Martin Simone, Reynolds acknowledged that he 
really doesn't know how much money he made, how much he spent or how much he 
has left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Reynolds, how do you know you have a cash-flow problem?" the attorney 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I have cut back," Reynolds replied. "I have sold everything I had to 
pay bills and I have been asked . . . not to spend any money because I have 
bills to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 He told Simone it "would be difficult for any person who takes a job as an 
actor does to talk about how much he made each year, each month, each week. It 
fluctuates. I can't tell you exactly what I made the last six years."  
</P>
<P>
 He said a previous business manager "took" $15 million from him. For the past 
six years, he said, his financial affairs have been handled by another man. 
</P>
<P>
 But asked by Anderson's attorney to identify that money manager, Reynolds 
glanced toward a group of men seated in the front row of the courtroom.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ray, yeah, is that who they mean?" Reynolds asked. "What is your last name, 
Ray?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Young," the money manager responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial manager Ray Young is expected to be a key witness today. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's lawyers homed in on a $10-million discrepancy between the assets 
Reynolds reported in a loan application in May and a financial statement he 
gave the court in September. 
</P>
<P>
 In the May statement, Reynolds listed assets of more than $7.5 million. But in 
September, he claimed to be more than $2 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the judge seemed stunned by what he called a "$10-million swing over six 
months." 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have had someone that I owed that amount to," Reynolds explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you lose $10 million?" the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I did," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial statements provided earlier to the court showed a monthly gift 
budget of $8,300, but Reynolds said he can no longer afford such gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many gifts have you bought this year?" Simone asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember," Reynolds said. He said the last one he recalled was a $19 
rubber football he gave his son. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial statements also showed that Reynolds has spent about $180,000 on 
"divorce related expenses." Asked what those expenses entailed, Reynolds shot 
back: "I don't know, but I'm sure that's lawyers. You'll have to ask Mr. Young. 
You guys stack up a lot of hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The $10,000 he spent on personal items, Reynolds claimed, was used to buy 
books.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't play golf. I don't gamble. . . . I read when I can't sleep, which is 
every night the past two years." 
</P>
<P>
 The breakup of his marriage began a streak of hard times for Reynolds. Dinah 
Shore, a former lover with whom he remained close, died of cancer. The Florida 
Citrus Commission and the Quaker State oil company dropped him as a TV 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the victim of an attempted mugging in Studio City and in March was 
hospitalized with chest pains. His "Evening Shade" series was canceled by CBS. 
Reruns of its first four seasons were sold at a discount to the Family Channel 
in a move that reportedly cost Reynolds millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 As he left the courtroom, Reynolds acknowledged, "I didn't look too good. 
That's why I'm an actor. I'm not an accountant." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that his difficulties in the courtroom are no different than other 
divorced dads, even if "the numbers are bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I owe $5 and I got $4."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE PLANS REVISED; SCHOOL FARM SPARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By FRANK MANNING

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College President Mary Lee, at the behest of a community group working 
to preserve the school's farm, has revised a tentative master plan for the 
school that would have encroached on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, designed in part to bring in revenue to the financially strapped 
school, includes such commercial ventures as a golf range, farm museum and 
300-seat domed theater that would also serve as a planetarium. 
</P>
<P>
 It also includes a discovery pavilion, where children and adults can get 
hands-on experience in science, and a 160- to 260-seat conference center. 
</P>
<P>
 When the original version of the plan was introduced, Margo Murman, president 
of the Coalition to Save the Farm, praised Lee's efforts to bring in more 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But she also urged Lee to consolidate the plans onto a 160-acre tract on the 
main campus near the administration building, leaving the farm's 240 acres 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 In the original version of the plan, the discovery pavilion, farm museum and 
planetarium would be located on farmland. Under the revised plan, those 
facilities have been moved to a part of the campus away from the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made some changes based on input," said Lee, who has been meeting 
with various community and school groups throughout the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Murman has been named chairwoman of a newly created community 
advisory committee, formed to offer input to the school on the master plan and 
other issues. The group has 18 members, including Shirley Blessing, a member of 
the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, and Evie Phillips of the Woodland 
Hills Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, which next meets Jan. 3, will review an updated version of the 
plan presented by Lee, said Murman. The meeting will be at the school from 5:30 
to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has asked Lee to provide more details in her plan, Murman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unclear as to how much space these buildings are going to take up 
and where the parking is going to be," Murman said. "All the buildings and 
things should be drawn to scale and they are not." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who took over as president in April, has been under pressure to preserve 
the farm while at the same time solving the school's fiscal woes. Some say the 
farm is a waste of money because of low enrollment in the school's agricultural 
programs. That money would be better used for the school's basic academic 
programs, those critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Blessing, whose organization has clashed in the past with school officials 
over land-use issues, said any plan should focus on improving education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to think about where we will be 25 years from now," she said. "You 
can't just think about the straits the college may be in financially today." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to find some way to support the uses of the land," Lee said. "We pay 
for water, fences, animals, plants, road maintenance -- all of that costs 
money. It's expensive, especially with the enrollment at Pierce down right now. 
We have to go into some enterprising kinds of projects." FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; FAMILY, FRIENDS BURY STUDENT KILLED IN 
CRASH 
</P>

 The room David Gevorkyan shared with his sister Lana in their Glendale home is 
filled with model airplanes, which she said he could assemble in a matter of 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really fast at it," Lana Gevorkyan, 13, said Monday, still speaking of 
her brother in the present tense as she watched his burial. 
</P>
<P>
 David was one of two Crescenta Valley High School students killed Nov. 28 when 
their car skidded off Angeles Crest Highway and fell 500 feet down a 
mountainside. On Monday, more than 200 students, relatives and friends mourned 
as David was buried at Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know David's love for the ROTC, we know his love for flying airplanes," 
said Ken Biermann, principal of Crescenta Valley High, to the mourners. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is now up there with the angels, flying over all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students wore T-shirts bearing the words "In memory of David, Sevag" -- 
referring to Sevag Cholakian, 15, who was buried Friday. Three other students 
are recovering from their injuries, Biermann said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car's driver, Malineh Martussian, 19, had been unconscious and in critical 
condition all last week, but was sent home in good condition Sunday afternoon 
from County-USC Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were skipping school to celebrate two birthdays when their car 
skidded over the side of the road near the Mt. Wilson turnoff. CHP officers 
said the car was apparently going slower than the speed limit. Nonetheless, the 
priest who led the Armenian language service and Principal Biermann both 
reminded students to be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recognize what we face when we lose loved ones," Biermann said. "Please know 
how important it is to be on earth with us." 
</P>
<P>
 One of David's friends, a 14-year-old freshman who did not want her name used, 
said she thought it was important for students to be reminded to be careful, 
but added: "I don't think they should bring it up now." 
</P>
<P>
 As for David, she said, "He was loved by everybody. He had dreams to be a 
pilot. He was never mean. He would always tell jokes, he would make people 
laugh. And he was a good friend. He would risk his life for you." NICHOLAS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; RECALL GROUP GATHERS 2,900 SIGNATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group trying to recall the Agoura Hills City Council appears to have cleared 
the first hurdle in its drive to gather the signatures needed to force a recall 
election, the group's leader said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday, the group had about 2,900 signatures, enough to compel an 
official count, said Barbara Murphy of Citizens Against New Local Taxes. The 
group must turn in 2,405 signatures -- or 20% of the city's registered voters 
-- by Wednesday to require a recall election, according to the city clerk's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said Monday that she has made an informal count of the signatures using 
voter registration lists, and that to date, 80% to 90% of the signatures are 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a nail biter, right down to the very last minute," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The signatures will be counted at the city clerk's office, city officials 
said. If they number at least 2,405, the signatures will be sent to the County 
Clerk/Registrar Recorder's office, to be checked for validity. If 2,405 
signatures are deemed valid, the City Council must call an election, to be held 
in not less than 88 days or more than 125 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's group launched the recall drive last summer after the council 
unanimously approved a 4% tax on electricity, gas and telephone service to help 
close what the city says is a $1-million deficit. The recall group says the 
deficit is far less and that the city could have balanced the budget without 
the tax. The city, the recall group claims, has wasted money and has allowed 
city salaries to spiral out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members insist that the tax was necessary and that their position was 
supported by most of the members of the city's budget committee. The recall, 
council members charge, was secretly sparked by business interests angry with 
the council over its support for an ordinance banning pole signs, a charge 
denied by the recall group. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members, noting that the recall group has used a consultant to 
help gather signatures, says that proves that the recall is being spurred by 
outside interests. Recall leaders, for their part, argue that using outside 
consultants is justified if it helps get the recall issue before voters. FRANK

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY SUMMITS TO TAKE COUNCIL ON THE ROAD 
</P>

<P>
 The Burbank City Council and other city officials will take government on the 
road, hosting a series of four "neighborhood summits" over the next three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 During its meeting at 7 p.m. today, the council is scheduled to finalize plans 
for the summits, wherein city officials will talk about issues facing the city 
and answer residents' questions on city matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a follow-up to a 23-question survey distributed to each of 
Burbank's 41,000 households in September. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said about 9,000 households filled out and returned the survey, 
a response of about 21%. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey information has been divided by census tracts, giving the city an 
idea of what issues are more important in each neighborhood. At each of the 
neighborhood summits, the city's presentation will focus on those issues, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative schedule for the summits is: Dec. 15 at Jordan Middle School, 
Jan. 12 at Jefferson Elementary School, Jan. 26 at Luther Burbank School and 
Feb. 16 at Emerson Elementary School. Each meeting is from 7 to 9 p.m. STEVE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND; FUNDS SOUGHT TO REPAIR RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sterling's, a landmark restaurant in Sunland, has not yet fallen to a 
demolition crew, but its owners are still playing the same waiting game that 
began when the Northridge earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 1, the Los Angeles City Department of Building and Safety threatened 
to have the restaurant torn down unless it was repaired by the end of 
September.But Councilman Joel Wachs was able to get an indefinite extension 
granted, said Vicki Lee, Wachs' deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Wachs' office and the restaurant owners, Al Jesensky and Ben Caputo, are 
trying to find a way to pay for an estimated $350,000 in damage to the 
restaurant -- either through the Small Business Administration or other loan 
programs, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very difficult situation that Sterling's is in," Lee said. "We're 
looking into every alternative program that might be available." 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling's started a petition drive earlier this year to garner support, and 
its owners, as well as Wachs, have written to a wide variety of federal and 
state officials looking for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling's Restaurant first opened in 1938 and has been at its current 
location at 8737 Fenwick St. since 1965. It has been a popular meeting place 
for most groups in the Sunland and Tujunga area for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant also draws groups from Lake View Terrace, Sylmar, Burbank and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Sunland was spared by the temblor, but the Jan. 17 quake buckled 
floors, cracked walls and separated the walk-in freezer and refrigerator from 
the walls at the restaurant, which was in default on an SBA loan. That has 
hampered its attempts to get emergency help. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; POLICE COMMEND RESIDENTS FOR SUCCESSFUL 
PARTNERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.D. STRAUB 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Celebrating the success of the North Hollywood Division's Police Assisted 
Surveillance Team, Los Angeles police and City Council representatives Monday 
presented commendations to residents and local businesses for their roles in 
what one councilman said should be a model for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 community members, including about 15 uniformed officers, 
attended the morning ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Modern law enforcement is best, not as a unilateral force," said Los Angeles 
Police Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy, "but as a partnership between police and 
their communities." 
</P>
<P>
 The team, known as PAST, which Capt. Robert McNamara calls the eyes and ears 
of the force, assists the Los Angeles Police Department in what police call a 
tangible example of community-based policing.  
</P>
<P>
 PAST members monitor, for example, shopping center parking lots during the 
holiday season, reporting all suspicious activity to police officers stationed 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon touted PAST as "a model program for the whole 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 State-of-the-art radio equipment, including 10 walkie-talkie radios and an 
antenna that has been installed on top of the Universal City Texaco building, 
will allow community volunteers to communicate with North Hollywood police 
"from Studio City to Sun Valley," police said. 
</P>
<P>
 To inaugurate the equipment, each councilman attending the presentation -- 
Alarcon, President John Ferraro and Joel Wachs -- attempted to radio officers 
stationed at three locations in the East Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ferraro and Wachs had difficulty operating the equipment, Alarcon 
received wild applause when the officer he called came in loud and clear with 
"It's a bit nippy out here at Sunland (Boulevard) and the Golden State 
(Freeway), councilman." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Corbett, one of several residents commended Monday, gave the group a 
donation check and said "perhaps this money can be used to train the councilmen 
(to use the radios)." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has raised more than $10,000 in the last year by sponsoring such 
fund-raising activities as garage sales, T-shirt sales, corporate donations and 
Hug-a-Cop, which raised nearly $1,500 when people paid $1 for hugs from North 
Hollywood officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs said crime is down in the Valley because of the commendable relationship 
between police and community members. "Government can provide the facilities 
and the resources, but we can't replace the responsibility of the community," 
he said. L.D. STRAUB

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: $10-MILLION HIKE FOR QUAKE REPAIR URGED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Adding to another quake-assistance program, a Los Angeles city housing panel 
backed a proposal Monday to increase by $10 million the amount of money 
available for owners and investors interested in repairing quake-damaged 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will issue $10 million in tax-exempt bonds to help private banks and 
lending institutions finance repairs of about 500 properties citywide, 
according to the proposal approved by the City Council's Housing and Community 
Redevelopment Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be added to the $24 million already offered in the so-called 
Loans-to-Lenders program, which uses tax-exempt bonds to help banks make 
low-interest loans to the owners of quake-damaged buildings and investors who 
want to buy and repair damaged properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just another item on the menu" of assistance programs, said Robert 
Moncrief, major projects manager for the city's Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The previously approved $24 million is being loaned by Home Savings of America 
and First Federal Bank, two lending institutions that agreed to participate in 
the program. The new $10 million will be loaned by Quaker City Federal Savings, 
a Whittier-based savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The banks are responsible for paying off the bonds and are backed by the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board. HUGO MARTIN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST; WAYSTATION TRYING TO SAVE TIGERS IN 
IRELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Wildlife Waystation, a sanctuary for abused or abandoned animals in the 
mountains above Lake View Terrace, is trying to rescue four malnourished and 
ill tigers currently languishing in an airport in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waystation is located on a 160-acre ranch in Angeles National Forest. 
Martine Colette, a seamstress turned animal rescuer, opened the station in 1976 
as a licensed, nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch, which is equipped with a full-scale veterinary hospital, is home to 
1,000 animals and provides 24-hour "wild animal response" rescue service in the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The tigers -- two cubs and two adults -- are victims of "exceeding hardship 
and cruelty," Colette said. The adult tigers -- a male and female aged 7 and 8 
-- are either Siberian or Bengal, and originally belonged to a circus in 
England. They were sold to private owners in Ireland, and were improperly cared 
for, Colette said.  
</P>
<P>
 Irish animal cruelty investigators discovered the sick and hungry tigers 
several months ago and confiscated them. Three weeks ago, the female gave birth 
to two cubs. A fifth tiger was euthanized because the animal was too sick to 
save, Colette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colette said Irish authorities sought homes for the tigress across Europe, but 
had no success. "We've agreed to take the animals and to pay for their care and 
upkeep," she said, noting that customs permits have already been processed.  
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, there is only one airline that flies directly from Ireland to 
Los Angeles, and they can't transport animals. There must be some way, an air 
freight company, or a private interest who can help us find a way to get those 
tigers. We must get them here as soon as possible. There must be somebody who 
knows how we can save these animals."  
</P>
<P>
 If the tigers are obtained, they will become part of one of the most 
remarkable and diverse cat families in the world.  
</P>
<P>
 Colette has rescued cougars, bobcats, jaguars, panthers, tigers, lions -- and 
even a ligress -- a cross between a lion and a tiger. All live in immaculate, 
roomy shelters designed to give the animals room to prowl. There are trees, 
boulders and branches to climb. 
</P>
<P>
 Colette has several other tigers including Angela, a Bengal tiger rescued from 
a tragic fate. Formerly part of a circus act, Angela was found freezing to 
death in a crate in an Alaskan warehouse. She was abandoned by her owner and 
left without food or water for an estimated 10 days before she was found and 
shipped to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information or means to help transport the animals to the 
waystation may call: (818) 899-5201. TIM MAY

 Canoga Park Elementary School teacher Mark Trueblood believes that children 
learn best through visual experiences, so he offers an image-packed curriculum 
to his fourth- and fifth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 His creative teaching method has not only stirred interest in the arts and 
sciences among his pupils, but also earned him a nomination for this year's 
BRAVO award. 
</P>
<P>
 BRAVO honors two teachers "who demonstrate innovation and creativity in making 
the arts an integral part of the curriculum," according to the education office 
of the Music Center, which sponsors the awards program. 
</P>
<P>
 Trueblood, who is among 90 nominees from throughout Southern California, said 
he illustrates all his subjects with objects, such as a huge log cabin in the 
back of the classroom or costumes out of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of visualizing," he said. "Children have a bank of reference 
material in their minds." Trueblood said strong visual images are more 
effective and more likely to be retained by children. 
</P>
<P>
 Trueblood's curriculum also includes drawing, to teach perspective and 
architecture. Starting in January, his class will take a field trip to sketch 
some of the San Fernando Valley's older buildings. MAKI BECKER

SENATE APPROVES RENAMING SIMI FREEWAY AFTER REAGAN; TRANSPORTATION: IN WAKE OF 
38-0 VOTE, CALTRANS WILL INSTALL SIGNS AT EACH END ONCE THE ESTIMATED $4,000 
COST IS RAISED THROUGH PRIVATE DONATIONS.

 With fond words for the nation's 40th President, the state Senate on Monday 
overwhelmingly approved designating the Simi Valley Freeway as the Ronald 
Reagan Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day of the new 1995-96 legislative session, the Senate voted 38 
to 0 to re-christen the entire length of the freeway in honor of the two-term 
President from California. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Transportation will begin installing signs at each end 
of the freeway as soon as money is raised from private sources to pay for the 
work, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated cost is $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), a co-author of the resolution along 
with state Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), urged colleagues 
to approve it in part because the freeway leads to the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's only appropriate that with the Reagan library in the area, right 
at the end of the 118 freeway, it would be named for Ronald Reagan," Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A more impassioned plea came from state Sen. Henry J. Mello (D-Watsonville), 
who praised the 83-year-old Reagan for displaying "great courage" in recently 
disclosing publicly that he suffers from Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Reagan freeway designation is really appropriate," Mello said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But more important is to give recognition because he had the courage not to 
hide his disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Mello said Reagan's candid statements in an open letter addressed to "my 
fellow Americans" will help remove the stigma for other memory-loss sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Smith, director of the presidential library, said the freeway naming 
is a fitting honor for Reagan, who inspires many library visitors with "the 
sense that the Reagan years were the last golden age in the Golden State." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of his great attributes was to foster a sense of hope," said Smith, 
noting that the Legislature's designation proves that public nostalgia for the 
Republican President is more than just a passing fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the Assembly passed a similar resolution authored by 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and backed by a lengthy bipartisan list 
of co-authors.

EX-CSUN ATHLETE IS KILLED IN CAR CRASH; VENTURA: DAVID EGGERT, 24, WHO SIGNED 
WITH MONTREAL EXPOS BASEBALL CLUB IN '92, APPARENTLY FELL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL 
OF HIS CAR.

 A minor league pitcher and former Cal State Northridge standout was killed 
over the weekend after he apparently fell asleep at the wheel of his car and 
crashed into a tree near the junction of the Ventura Freeway and California 
126, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Eggert, a former Ventura College and Cal State Northridge standout who 
signed a contract with the Montreal Expos baseball club in 1992, died at the 
scene of the crash about 2:15 a.m. Sunday, Ventura County medical officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old Ventura native had come home for the off-season and was 
preparing to report to spring training in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could hit a baseball a long way," said his father, also named David 
Eggert. "He was a strong boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Deputy Coroner Zelmira Isaac said Eggert was traveling south on the 
Ventura Freeway just miles from his home when he lost control of his white 1991 
Ford Escort and plummeted down an embankment near the California 126 turnoff. 
</P>
<P>
 He was alone in the car and died instantly when it struck a eucalyptus tree, 
Isaac said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident left the athlete's family in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping that he would make Triple A this year," his father said. 
"Given the opportunity, he was going back out there and giving it another shot. 
He loved it more than anything. It's all he'd been groomed for his whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 Eggert's high school coaches remembered him Sunday as a star athlete in both 
football and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an excellent player," Ventura High baseball coach Dan Smith said. "We 
went to the semifinals that year (1987). He didn't pitch much in high school, 
but he was a dandy." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and former teammates described Eggert as an aggressive left-handed 
pitcher who always worked as hard as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a good competitor," said Mike Sims, a minor league catcher who caught 
Eggert's pitches at CSUN. "He went out there all the time and gave 100%. He was 
a guy that made people laugh off the field, but once he got on the field, he 
was all business." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, Eggert had attended a party with co-workers from his 
off-season job at the Big 5 sporting goods store in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found no evidence that he had been drinking, but toxicology 
tests will be performed, Isaac said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggert played right field and was a relief pitcher for Ventura High School 
before enrolling at Ventura College. There, he helped his team take the 1989 
Western State Conference title in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He next played two seasons at CSUN before being drafted in the 21st round of 
the 1992 amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggert is survived by his wife, Julie; a 3-year-old stepdaughter, Brittnee, 
and a 2-month-old son, Shawn. He is also survived by his parents, David and 
Cindy-Lou Eggert; a brother, John, and sister, Kim.

VALLEY INTERVIEW : FOR A CAMPUS POLICE OFFICER, IT'S BEEN 22 YEARS OF KIDS 
BEING KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Lt. Walter Nelson of the School Police of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District talked about his agency's work in the San Fernando Valley schools, 
from monitoring the recent anti-Proposition 187 protests to daily duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigator, a 22-year veteran school officer, discussed the similarities 
and differences in youth over his career and the crimes against people and 
property that continue to plague the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 He stressed the need for communication among administrators, school police, 
teachers, students and parents, who also sometimes can pose a problem for 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years and all the contact with students of all ages, Nelson has 
decided that fashion changes notwithstanding, kids are still kids and if you 
listen closely enough, sometimes you can learn from them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How many police officers are assigned to San Fernando Valley 
schools?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It varies depending on the shift, the time of the day and weekends. 
During school hours, the most critical time because kids, students and staff 
are on campus, we have six patrol units. That includes three sergeants. It's 
broken down into three areas, and we have a sergeant and several officers 
assigned to each of these areas. Each area has about three to four high 
schools, and a host of junior high and elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there police officers at every high school?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Every high school in the city has a school officer assigned to the 
campus. The majority have two. At the middle schools, there are some in the 
Valley that do not have officers because our manpower doesn't allow it. 
Eventually, I think the department would like to have at least one officer at 
the middle school also. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the major purpose of the officers assigned to the high school 
campus?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The officers on campus are there to provide security for the kids to learn. 
The patrol officers do the same thing at the elementary schools and provide 
support to officers on the campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Students are becoming more and more politicized . Does that make your job 
more difficult?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The students are much more aware of the things they can do. They're much 
more aware of what's going on within the school community, and they know their 
rights, and they sometimes walk a fine line between right and wrong. It is also 
more difficult because our agency hasn't grown much over the last 10 years. You 
have such a diverse group of kids across the area, and they are more mobile 
than before. They can live in the East Valley or in the inner city and attend 
school in the West Valley. It makes our job more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's talk about the 187 protests . They were something new, right?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That was a new experience for us, but I don't have an opinion on the kids 
being involved in the protests. Our main focus was that the kids who were 
involved were not injured and did not destroy property while protesting. Our 
concern was that the kids weren't hurt. We did not encourage or discourage 
them. That's not our job to get involved with the students. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were they peaceful, for the most part?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They were. We didn't have students injured. I honestly can't think of any 
students who were arrested during the protests, but I don't think we arrested 
any of the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: On any given day, what kind of problems can you expect to deal with?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We can expect any number of crimes from batteries involving students 
against students, trespassers. We may have to deal with weapons on campus, and 
that could mean knives and we would have to respond to those types of 
situation. It would range from those kinds of crimes to a simple fight between 
students. We also deal with rival gang confrontations that occur on campus or 
its immediate surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Tell me about your jurisdiction . How far does it go?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We are supplemental to the Los Angeles Police Department. Our jurisdiction 
has to do with the school campus and the surrounding area. That could mean the 
park next door or wherever our kids are congregating and the administration is 
concerned that a child could be injured. We don't necessarily make a point to 
go out into the community, because that is LAPD. But when we do have a 
situation in close proximity to the school, we would notify LAPD and respond if 
that's what was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which schools seem to have the most problems? Do one or two stand out?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In the past I used to be able to say that, but now I would say that the 
schools basically have equal numbers of problems at all of the sites. I can't 
say that a particular school in the East or mid-Valley has more of a problem 
than any other place. They all have their share of problems. Some are busier 
than others based on the amount of traffic that may go through there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've said that some school administrators handle their own problems to 
some degree? When do you step in?  
</P>
<P>
 A: If it's a felony, of course, we definitely have to handle it. If it's a 
situation where an administrator needs law-enforcement expertise that doesn't 
necessarily call for an arrest, the officer may be called in to provide the 
technical expertise, but the administrator would handle that situation. It's 
generally left up to the administrator and office at a particular site. But if 
a subject has to be arrested, we will make that arrest. If counseling is 
appropriate, then that's what will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have there been occasions when a parent has been arrested?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There have been those occasions, yes. There are situations when parents 
become disruptive in the school office. If that person is disruptive, 
uncooperative, and the administrator has a problem, we have been called and 
gone out and arrested parents for disturbing the peace. We don't prefer to do 
it, but if that is the situation we have to handle it. It is also against the 
law to threaten a school administrator or employee. That has happened and that 
is a violation. There have been instances when parents have become physically 
abusive toward school personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the major crimes you deal with?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Vandalism is bad. Our biggest problem is burglary and vandalism. There is a 
tremendous amount of dollars that could be used for education and materials 
that is spent repairing schools that are hit by vandalism. It runs well over $1 
million a year for vandalism alone. Property loss is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You're an investigator, and you do the follow-ups on crime reports? What's 
most common?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Most common is burglary. In many cases, we are talking about professional 
burglars. I've been doing this for five years, and in many instances the 
burglaries were being committed by adult, professional commercial burglars 
going after the equipment that's in the schools. The thing about it is that we 
will arrest a burglar who has committed burglaries at a number of schools. 
Often times we will arrest the same person again after he is released (from 
custody) from the first crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can parents help you keep the schools safe?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's essential to us that parents keep tabs on what their kids are doing. 
If kids are coming in with stuff that they don't know how they got it, they 
should ask and take an interest in it. If it says LAUSD on it, it probably came 
from the school. The cost is passed on to all of us. But aside from that, if we 
arrest a minor for burglary, the parents can be billed for restitution. It's 
important that they be alert of what their kids are doing. That would help our 
job a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been with the LAUSD for 22 years with the department . Have the kids 
changed?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Kids are kids, but times have changed. There is so much pressure on them 
now, I sympathize with the things they have to deal with. For the most part, 
the great majority of the kids are good, hard-working kids, and we only come in 
contact with a small majority of them. They are great to be around, and I've 
learned a lot from them and continue to learn from them. I think maybe if all 
of us took the time to listen to them, we'd be better off. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Kids' styles have changed to the point where gang culture has an effect . 
Has that caused a problem?  
</P>
<P>
 A: You have to be open-minded and not judge every kid you see in baggy clothes 
and look at them like they are gang members. You've got to be cautious in the 
way you deal with them. You can't prejudge them. But you have to recognize that 
there is a gang element out there and you have to be alert about how you handle 
the situation when you come in contact with them. You don't want to be 
heavy-handed to a kid wearing baggy clothes. It can be a sticky situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you distinguish the difference?  
</P>
<P>
 A: By talking with them, and I tell officers, especially those who are new on 
high school campuses, don't be afraid to talk to anybody. That is the only way 
you will know who is good and who may be bringing trouble on campus. You've got 
to talk with them, and a lot of times you'll find that whatever preconceived 
notions you have will be dispelled if you talk with the kids and open yourself 
to be communicated with. They will come back and talk with you and tell you 
things. You can't build a wall around yourself because there are 2,500 to 3,000 
student at some of our highs schools, and in many instances there is only one 
officer. You have to counsel them sometimes. Even the gang members will come 
and ask your advice. You would be surprised.

TESTIMONY BEGINS IN PANAH TRIAL; CRIME: NICOLE PARKER'S FATHER RECALLS THAT 
ACCUSED MURDERER ONCE ADMIRED HIS DAUGHTER'S LOOKS. HE SAYS THE TALK MAY HAVE 
OCCURRED JUST PRIOR TO HER DISAPPEARANCE.

 The father of an 8-year-old girl whose bruised and sexually battered body was 
found stuffed in a suitcase in Woodland Hills testified Monday that her alleged 
killer once admired his daughter's looks.  
</P>
<P>
 "He commented on how beautiful my daughter was," Edward Parker said, referring 
to a brief conversation he had prior to Nicole Parker's death with his 
next-door neighbor, Hooman Ashkan Panah, her alleged killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker recounted the remark on the witness stand as testimony began Monday in 
Panah's trial in Van Nuys Superior Court. Panah, a 23-year-old department store 
clerk, is charged with murder, kidnaping, rape, sodomy and committing lewd acts 
with a child. If found guilty, he could be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah has pleaded not guilty to the charges and plans to use an insanity 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said the conversation with Panah may have taken place just hours before 
Nicole Parker disappeared on Nov. 23, 1993, from the Woodland Hills apartment 
complex where he and Panah lived. Nicole's body was found 24 hours later in 
Panah's closet after a frantic, highly publicized search staged from a command 
post in the sprawling apartment complex.  
</P>
<P>
 Panah was arrested after a co-worker notified police that he had confessed to 
the killing. The co-worker, Rauni Campbell, is scheduled to testify today. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole lived in Tarzana with her mother, Lori Parker, who also testified 
Monday. Nicole had met Panah previously during other visits with her father, 
Lori Parker said. "She said (Panah) was her friend," she said, breaking into 
tears on the witness stand.  
</P>
<P>
 In a low-key but chilling opening statement, prosecutor Peter Berman told the 
jury that medical experts cannot determine the exact cause of Nicole Parker's 
death. The second-grader, who was four feet tall and weighed about 45 pounds, 
choked on her own vomit and also suffered possibly deadly injuries from being 
sodomized and throttled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that Nicole Parker fought for her life," Berman told an 
audience that included Panah's mother and about 25 of Nicole Parker's 
relatives, saying that her assailant gripped her mouth and chin so violently in 
an effort to subdue her that he left four distinct finger marks.

SHOOTOUT VOTE REASONS SOUGHT; COURT: THE COUNCIL WAS URGED BY A JUDGE TO 
EXPLAIN WHY IT INDEMNIFIED NINE POLICE. A JURY HAD ORDERED PAYMENT TO SLAIN 
MEN'S SURVIVORS AFTER MCDONALD'S ROBBERY.

 A federal judge urged members of the Los Angeles City Council Monday to 
explain more fully why they voted to indemnify nine police officers who were 
ordered by a jury to pay $44,000 to the survivors of three men killed during a 
shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 After sharply criticizing the city attorney's office, U.S. District Judge J. 
Spencer Letts offered council members a chance to waive the executive and 
attorney-client privileges they have invoked so far.  
</P>
<P>
 "The defendants are entitled to tell their story without having it blocked 
off," Letts said. He imposed a deadline of Wednesday -- one day before jury 
selection is scheduled -- and offered to seal testimony of the council and 
conduct future hearings in his chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was a victory for lawyer Stephen Yagman, who wants council members 
held personally liable for their vote to protect police. Yagman won the verdict 
on behalf of the slain men's families. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're either going to 'fess up or go to hell in a handcart," said Yagman, 
who contends the council's action helped foster a policy condoning police 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, lawyers for the council, including City Atty. James Hahn, who 
provided legal advice for council members, seemed stung by some of Letts' 
remarks and left the courtroom stone-faced. Hahn refused to comment but members 
of his staff said they would consult with the council immediately to decide how 
to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they're going to waive their rights," said Skip Miller, 
representing the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The complicated case stems from a 1990 shootout at a San Fernando Valley 
McDonald's, in which police killed three alleged robbers and wounded a fourth 
as they fled the restaurant. Jurors found that the police, members of the 
department's elite Special Investigations Section, used excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 After reaching their verdict, jurors said they deliberately kept the amount of 
money low -- the award was to be split among the defendants -- because they 
wanted the police officers, including then-Chief Daryl F. Gates, to pay out of 
their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Council voted in closed session to indemnify the officers anyway, 
prompting the current lawsuit by Yagman on behalf of Johanna Trevino, now age 
4, whose father was one of the men killed in the Sunland incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl is entitled to punitive damages from council members because of their 
vote, according to Yagman, who says his efforts to learn about the 
deliberations that led to the action have been stonewalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our contention is they always rubber-stamped this," Yagman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two mistrials have been declared in the case, and city attorneys have appealed 
to the U.S. Supreme Court in unsuccessful bids to have it dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council declines to waive their privileges, jury selection will begin 
Thursday morning, Letts said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council agrees to answer Yagman's questions, the trial will be delayed. 
Letts also must rule on a defense motion to dismiss the case.

 A Lancaster man died early Monday morning after being trapped inside a mobile 
home by a fire started by a portable electric heater, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny Harper, 32, didn't wake up until smoke from the fire had filled the 
mobile home, making it impossible to see him, said his girlfriend, Diane Gray, 
40. She escaped outside and smashed a window, shouting for him to follow her 
voice, but he kept wandering aimlessly inside the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a daze," she said. "He didn't know where he was because of the 
smoke. He just couldn't come through." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple in the guest room was able to escape uninjured, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire started just before 1:30 a.m. at the Desert Breeze Mobile Home Park 
at 45014 27th St. East. The residence was completely engulfed in flames when 
firefighters from Los Angeles County Fire Station 117 -- located within sight 
of the mobile home, about a quarter-mile away -- arrived a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time there was obviously nobody alive inside the building," said Mike 
Godde, one of the firefighters who extinguished the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who picked up aluminum cans to help Gray make ends meet, was found 
lying in a hallway of the charred residence. Fire officials said he probably 
died of smoke inhalation before the flames could reach him. 
</P>
<P>
 The mobile home park was purchased by the city of Lancaster at a foreclosure 
auction in March after the previous owner failed to make payments, said Michael 
Adams, the city's senior project coordinator. The city decided to close the 
park because most of the 32 trailers were in disrepair. Residents in all but 
seven homes had been moved when Monday's fire occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said she had been planning to move this week from the mobile home, which 
has been frequently burglarized and vandalized during the seven years she lived 
there.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lenny and I were planning to get married," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The heater apparently ignited some cardboard nearby, but one of the neighbors 
appeared to get the fire under control using a hose, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't look like anything where the whole place was going to go," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a stack of boxes near the flames, which Gray had packed for her move, 
caught fire and the blaze spread quickly through the residence. She said she 
escaped by jumping through a living room window that had been broken out 
earlier when juveniles were throwing rocks at her mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials estimated the damage at $25,000. Gray said she lost everything 
inside, including the $1,100 the city gave her to help her move to a new 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be staying with friends," she said. "I feel a little shaky about doing 
things on my own right now."

AFTER THE FALL, CITRON SILENT, DEFENDERS FEW; PROFILE: LONG CAREER MARKED BY 
CREDIBILITY, WORK ETHIC AND FINANCIAL ACUMEN ENDS IN AN EXTRAORDINARY TWIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For years, Robert L. Citron was lauded as the genius whose aggressive 
investment strategies brought in millions of dollars for Orange County and 
other governments. He was a popular figure -- particularly for a Democrat in a 
Republican bastion. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, if there was anyone in political circles who still thought he 
was up to the job, they weren't saying so -- or at least not very loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even Citron himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Holed up in his Santa Ana home after resigning in the midst of the county's 
financial crisis -- Citron remained silent. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an extraordinary twist in the political career of a man whose 
credibility and work ethic and ability to gain reelection had rarely been 
challenged in more than two decades of public service. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hint of trouble had come last spring, as Citron faced his first 
political opponent since he was elected treasurer in 1970. Citron was almost 
aghast that anyone -- especially his Republican challenger, John M.W. Moorlach 
-- would question his handling of the county's billions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reputation is so good as to the types and the quality of investments that 
I do," he said at the time. "I'm not blowing my own horn here, but I am 
recognized nationally for my investment ability and by the state of 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's opinion of himself was echoed then by many others -- Democrats and 
Republicans -- including Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. 
Riley, who told The Times: "I don't know how in the hell he does it, but he 
makes us all look good." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his longtime friends, Republican businessman Doy Henley, remembered 
teasing Citron during the most recent campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "How come you're the only county treasurer that's getting this" return on the 
investment? Henley would ask jokingly. "He never answered me on that one. . . . 
He's the kind of guy that could not do well with a lot of criticism. He had 
never had any criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in what has proven to be not only a looming financial disaster but also a 
political embarrassment for top Orange County officials, no one was looking 
good -- especially not Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 The man known as a "fighter" who would never give up ultimately gave in after 
a barrage of unprecedented criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron received support Monday from some outside the political circle, like 
Howard Hughett, a board member of the Orange County Trojan Club, where Citron 
was known as an unabashed cheerleader for his alma mater. (His car is equipped 
with USC vanity plates and a horn that plays the university fight song, and 
past Christmas cards featured him and his wife, Terry, attired in Trojan 
colors.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he should have" resigned, Hughett said. "Why should he?" 
</P>
<P>
 Operating in relative obscurity for so many years, Citron was rarely seen on 
the local political circuit of dinners and fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was a veteran of the internal political battles of Orange County 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his career, he was reprimanded by the Orange County Grand Jury for 
unjustly criticizing the head of the county's data-processing department. And 
in one of his first run-ins with Sheriff Brad Gates, Citron accused Gates of 
trying to "con" the county in order to get more money for his departmental 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 When he learned this year that Gates would not be joining the county's 
$2-million gang prosecution program -- funded with proceeds from Citron's 
investments -- he was one of the few county officials to publicly criticize the 
sheriff. Gates threatened to "have a heck of a lot to say" if Citron ever 
verbally attacked him again. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron was confident, then. He was the hero. 
</P>
<P>
 He had helped write the state law more than a decade ago that allowed local 
government treasurers across the state to engage in his innovative investment 
planning. During the last decade, his investments yielded an average return of 
9.03% -- nearly double that of some comparable investment pools. 
</P>
<P>
 He was known as a man who worked around the clock and rarely took vacations. 
The "gifts" he listed on financial-disclosure forms were mostly dinners with 
investment advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, for example, he reported a dinner with seven investment 
firms -- with each firm chipping in $14.06 to cover the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 He also reported a $22 Christmas wreath from Bradford and Marzec Inc., a Los 
Angeles firm, and a $9.48 pocket calendar from Callan Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 As the only Democrat in elective office in Orange County government, Citron 
said he tried to separate his personal politics from county business. He once 
hosted a fund-raiser for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown in his Santa Ana home, 
and in recent years gave only token campaign contributions to recipients 
including U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the local and state Democratic Party 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 But in what he would later blame as the reason Republicans had targeted him in 
his most recent election, Citron sent out a letter using his official title in 
1990 on behalf of then-Assemblyman Tom Umberg, the Garden Grove Democrat. The 
Democratic Assemblyman beat Republican Curt Pringle, and county GOP Chairman 
Thomas Fuentes never forgot it. 
</P>
<P>
 With the backing of the local Republican leaders, Moorlach entered the race 
this year and began criticizing Citron's investment portfolio, calling it too 
risky. 
</P>
<P>
 Never having been challenged before -- his last fund-raiser had been held 
eight years ago when he thought he might have an opponent -- Citron reached 
into his own pocket and jump-started his reelection campaign with an $11,000 
loan to himself. And then he began raising money, including some from firms 
that do business with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last campaign, Citron raised $51,222 -- a large amount for a race 
usually ignored by voters. About one-third of the donations came from 
attorneys, investment bankers and brokerage firms, including $3,000 from 
members of the county's brokerage firm, Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 As pressure mounted in recent days for Citron to resign, some of his financial 
backers in the investment community did not want to comment. Some quickly hung 
up when they heard his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican activists who failed to unseat Citron in the June primary were now 
smug. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past few days, we had a lot of people calling in for a recall 
effort," said Bill Christianson, executive director of the county GOP. "Today, 
we've had people calling in and saying, 'We told you so.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Vice Chairwoman Jo Ellen Allen echoed the sentiment and laid part 
of the blame at the feet of the Board of Supervisors -- all Republicans -- who 
chose to back Citron instead of listen to Moorlach's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have looked at it and instead they chose to ignore it," Allen 
said. "It sounds to me like (Citron) must be in more trouble than he thought, 
otherwise he would have stuck this out." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Moorlach urged the county Monday to set up an independent 
citizen panel to review the financial crisis and said he would consider taking 
on the treasurer's job if the supervisors ask him. But there is a chance that 
may not happen, since he has been a loud critic of the supervisors for refusing 
to heed his warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) said Citron's resignation was 
"probably was the appropriate thing to do" from a political standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's a concern as far as having the ability to bring aboard the 
expertise that we need at a time when we have to come up with some solutions," 
said Bergeson, who joins the Board of Supervisors next month. During the 
campaign, she had withdrawn her endorsement of Moorlach because she feared his 
criticism of Citron might harm the county's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials who had gained from Citron's financial success before 
being shocked by the downfall were saddened by his decision to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach City Manager Jerry L. Bankston called the resignation "tragic." 
</P>
<P>
 And La Palma City Manager Pamela Gibson said she felt sorry about how a once 
glowing career had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad his career, which has been so successful and so beneficial to 
everyone involved, has to end this way," Gibson said. "I think it's very, very 
sad and I wish it would be otherwise." Citron Moments 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's 24-year career as a 
relatively low-profile public official has been largely successful and 
sometimes pointed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Election: First elected county tax collector in 1970. Became treasurer in 
1973 when Board of Supervisors combined the positions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Politics: Only elected Democrat in Orange County government. Ran unopposed 
between 1970 and 1994 but faced unsuccessful election challenge in June primary 
from Republican John M.W. Moorlach, a certified public accountant who blasted 
his investment strategy as risky. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most recent annual salary: $100,339 
</P>
<P>
 * Galling Gates: In one of his first public run-ins with County Sheriff Brad 
Gates in 1977, Citron accused the sheriff of engaging in "a con game" by asking 
for more money in his budget than he needed and also subjecting the county to 
costly legal settlements. Gates responded that he didn't expect "someone who 
manages a very small operation, performing relatively simple and predictable 
tasks, to understand the dynamics" of running the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors: Citron managed funds from 185 cities, school districts and other 
government agencies. Yields from his investment pool have been consistently the 
highest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lobbying: Successfully lobbied the state in the 1970s to expand the 
investment options of government agencies. Citron's success over the years 
lured Santa Barbara and other municipalities from outside Orange County, along 
with nearly all local agencies, to contribute to investment pool. In the 
county, only San Juan Capistrano and Garden Grove did not contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investment strategy: Relied heavily on using investment pool's Treasury 
bills and bonds as collateral to borrow short-term at low interest rates and 
investing the borrowed funds in mid-term corporate bonds and securities that 
pay higher return rate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Returns: Averaged 9.03% return during the past decade, nearly double that of 
some comparable investment pools. However, in the past three years, returns 
have declined steadily, dropping as interest rates increased. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best return: 16.9% in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recognition: Named by the trade magazine City & State as one of the best 
county finance officers in the nation in 1988. Honored in December, 1993, by 
County Board of Supervisors for generating enough interest revenue through his 
investments to bankroll a new gang-suppression program run by the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Current status: Citron announced his resignation Monday, less than a week 
after disclosures that his risky investment strategy led to a $1.5-billion drop 
in the county's portfolio, now valued at $18.5 billion.

L.A. DISTRICT REVOKES PACT OF DROPOUT CHARTER SCHOOL; EDUCATION: ACTION IS 
TAKEN AMID REPORTS OF DEBT AND DISORGANIZATION. IT IS THE FIRST SUCH FAILURE IN 
U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Saying that the independent school for dropouts had become hopelessly 
disorganized and debt-ridden, the Los Angeles Unified School District board 
reluctantly revoked Edutrain Charter School's contract Monday evening, marking 
the first charter failure in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The board gave the Downtown school -- organized by educators and business 
leaders in 1993 -- the exclusive opportunity to reapply for one of the 
district's 10 charter school slots before April. 
</P>
<P>
 But today district officials will take the first step toward shutting the 
school by interviewing its more than 200 students for possible placement in 
other public schools and independent study programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In canceling the charter contract on a 5-2 vote, the board rejected Edutrain's 
plea for an additional three months to complete an extensive reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you violate our trust, the consequences are not one more chance," said 
board President Mark Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Doby, president of Edutrain's board of governors and a UCLA vice 
chancellor, said the board's decision was unfair and did not acknowledge vast 
improvement since enrollment accounting irregularities were first uncovered 
last spring. Doby said Edutrain's board will meet tonight to consider legal 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone deserves due process and there has been no due process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What will become of Edutrain's debt -- estimated by its own administrators at 
nearly $1 million -- remained unclear Monday because of vagaries in state 
charter school legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter law, passed in California in 1992, allows public schools to operate 
largely independent of district control, with the permission of the local 
school system. The contracts hold for five years, but may be revoked by the 
district if the school violates any of its own conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Edutrain, district general counsel Rich Mason said violations 
included poor record-keeping in the areas of enrollment and financial 
expenditures and an inability to prove that it has met its academic goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Edutrain's closure is a blow to the nation's charter school movement -- which 
has allowed 140 schools in five states to shed bureaucratic control -- because 
it raises questions about whether less oversight is better. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, none of the other charter schools have failed, although eight in 
Michigan currently are in limbo after a judge's ruling that charter law 
illegally usurps that state's authority over public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some national charter proponents took the Edutrain news in stride, saying 
that the independent schools must be held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference is, if charters fail, they will close," said Barbara Barrett, 
director of a Michigan group that is fighting the judge's ruling. "We have many 
regular schools that have been able to stay open whether they have been able to 
deliver or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Edutrain began as a school in July, 1993, after Los Angeles Unified agreed to 
the conversion of an independent study program known as Edutrain Inc. Its goals 
were laudable: design a program and create a culture that would be attractive 
to the city's most hard-core dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
 With shorter school days, on-site child care and a staff interested in solving 
personal as well as educational problems, Edutrain managed to attract more than 
500 students by last spring. About 85% of the student body had arrest records 
and many students had been out of school for years, yet 68 of them graduated in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the patina of success began to tarnish, beginning with the random visit 
in May of a state financial auditor who uncovered large discrepancies between 
school enrollment reports -- on which funding is based -- and actual numbers of 
students in classrooms and roll books. 
</P>
<P>
 As outside scrutiny of Edutrain grew, so did disorganization and infighting, 
school teachers and administrators agree. By fall, the problems had manifested 
themselves in a dwindling student enrollment -- to about 100 full-time students 
-- the flight of several of the founding teachers and the layoffs of many more 
teachers, staff members and student workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Edutrain to me was like a second home," said Heather Jackson, a single mother 
of two who stayed on as a paid intern after her June graduation, only to be 
laid off in October. "No one ever gave us any kind of notice that our jobs were 
in jeopardy. Now I'm looking for a job and Christmas is around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 The sympathies of the Los Angeles Unified school board began to wane amid 
allegations contained in an Edutrain board-commissioned audit that while 
teachers lacked essential supplies, administrators treated themselves to 
significant perks: a school-leased $39,000 sports car, $500-a-month housing 
allowance and a bodyguard for the principal, a secret $7,000 retreat to Carmel 
for select staff members and a well-furnished administrative floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote to revoke came on the heels of federal indictments of the director 
and a consultant at another independent study program, the Institute for 
Successful Living, on charges of bilking Los Angeles Unified out of $700,000 by 
overestimating enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no intentional wrongdoing has been alleged at Edutrain, it was 
apparent Monday that the recent indictments heightened board members' concern 
that they act quickly in response to reports of financial mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 As public discussion began to focus on Edutrain's spending decisions, its 
board president, Doby, doggedly continued to try to turn the debate back to the 
school's successes and the reorganization plan he had helped fashion, which 
called for replacing the top administrators and breaking the school into two 
smaller, more manageable pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 And even after Monday's vote, Doby remained hopeful that a compromise could be 
reached, perhaps one under which the district would assume control of Edutrain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may very well be that we can arrive at an alternative," he said.

BROWN DAZZLES BOTH SIDES WITH SURVIVAL SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Willie Brown's Assembly Democrats gathered Monday to discuss the imminent 
vote for the leadership of the Legislature's lower house, one of Brown's 
longtime allies said privately that he wished the Speaker would simply give up, 
gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later the same lawmaker emerged from the Democrats' closed-door 
strategy session grinning sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're pulling a rabbit out of the hat," he said, shaking his head in 
disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 A rabbit indeed. The hare Brown yanked from his figurative fedora Monday only 
added to his legend as a magician at manipulating the levers of power in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 No one who has watched Brown for the past 14 years had truly counted him out, 
even when Republicans amassed a seeming majority, with 41 seats in the 
80-member house. One GOP lawmaker, praising the Speaker's survival instincts, 
termed him a political Houdini. 
</P>
<P>
 But seeing a master at work can still amaze, even when you know his abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the smartest person you are ever going to meet in this business," said 
Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg, a Sacramento Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly chambers on Monday took on the aura of an arena before a 
championship fight. Packed with television reporters who rarely visit the 
Capitol for a battle over policy, the floor buzzed with conversation as 
Republicans prepared -- they thought -- to seize control for the first time in 
a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Brown's old friends were there to witness the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) stood in the back of the chamber, 
second-guessing the Democrats as they clumsily tried to oust Republican Richard 
Mountjoy from the house because he was elected simultaneously to the Assembly 
and the Senate. Standing next to Waters was Alice Huffman, longtime political 
director for one of Brown's biggest campaign contributors, the California 
Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Roos, a former assemblyman now running an education reform effort in Los 
Angeles, came, he said, to witness history. Roos, as Democratic majority leader 
and later second-in-command to Brown, was one of the Speaker's most trusted 
lieutenants when they served together. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a monumental moment for a true legend in American politics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more confident than others of his ability to hang on, Brown spent the 
weekend before what was supposed to be his political execution just the way he 
spends most of his time off -- in his hometown of San Francisco. Brown returned 
to Sacramento Sunday night for a dinner with Assembly Democrats at Biba, a 
fashionable Italian restaurant near the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaking off an inner ear infection, Brown breakfasted Monday morning on a 
banana and a glass of apple juice, then arrived at his office for meetings with 
his top deputies. After one final strategy session with Democrats -- one also 
attended by four or five young children who were here with members for the 
swearing-in ceremony -- Brown went to the floor, where as the senior member of 
the house, he led the newly elected members in the pledge to the flag. 
</P>
<P>
 When Assemblyman Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar bolted from the Republicans and 
voted for Brown, the Speaker seemed less surprised than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had been wooing Horcher since the Nov. 8 election, though the Speaker 
says he never offered Horcher anything in return for his vote. Brown's top aide 
said the Speaker never knew how the vote would go until Horcher announced it 
Monday, slamming his fist on his desk as he did so. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first time he ran for the post 20 years ago -- and lost -- Brown has 
known that the vote for Speaker is something that rests on more than ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a good shot to win the job at that time, Brown lost in part because he 
had not cultivated personal relationships with his peers. He spent the next six 
years doing just that, and in 1980 won the job when a coalition of Democrats 
and Republicans voted for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown never condoned the sort of ugly treatment of a member that Horcher 
received at the hands of his fellow Republicans after he accepted the Speaker's 
offer to serve as vice chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee. One 
Republican called Horcher a "political whore" after Monday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willie Brown learned the lesson in 1974 -- how you treat people as human 
beings is more important than political philosophy or anything else," said 
state Sen. Steve Peace of Chula Vista, a former Assemblyman and member of a 
group of five rebel Democrats who tried and failed to oust Brown in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, Peace noted, is known as a "members' Speaker." He sees as his 
constituency the 80 members of the Assembly more than the people of California. 
This fact has frustrated foes to no end but served Brown well for 14 years -- a 
tenure nearly twice as long as anyone else who ever held the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the opposition was left in awe on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very adroit, clever politician," said newly elected Republican Chuck 
Poochigian of Fresno.

BELEAGUERED TREASURER IN ORANGE COUNTY QUITS; FINANCES: INVESTMENT POOL ROBERT 
CITRON MANAGED HAS LOST $1.5 BILLION IN VALUE. FEDERAL REGULATORS STUDY 
RECORDS. 
</P>

<P>
 As federal regulators pored over records of Orange County's beleaguered 
$18.5-billion investment fund, county officials Monday announced the 
resignation of Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron after 24 years in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than six months after celebrating his reelection, Citron quit amid the 
ongoing fallout from his disclosure last week that the investment pool he 
managed for the county and 180 other public agencies across the state had lost 
$1.5 billion in value this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "After much thought and soul-searching and with much regret, I have decided 
for the benefit of the County of Orange to resign my elected office," Citron 
wrote to the county's administrative officer Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 By state law, Citron's assistants in the treasurer's and tax collector's 
offices were named to the top posts in each department. In January, when Citron 
was to begin a new term, the county Board of Supervisors will make new 
appointments to both jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad day, but Bob resigned in the best interests of the county," said 
James Kenan, finance director of the Orange County Transportation Authority, 
the largest single investor in the investment pool. "From a financial market 
standpoint, I think he just wanted stability to return." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors declined to discuss details of their deliberations after a 
two-hour, closed-door session, saying only that they would hold another closed 
session today to resume discussions about the financial crisis. In calling 
Monday's meeting, they cited the possibility of the county being drawn into 
litigation over the losses as their reason for barring the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments that came to light Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials disclosed that investigators from the federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission spent the weekend studying the county's investment 
portfolio and Citron's financial documents. SEC officials were said to be 
concerned over whether the fund was being adequately supervised and whether any 
payout of money from the pool would be equitably shared among its governmental 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions also were being raised about possible improper use of securities to 
collateralize the county's borrowing. Citron's office borrowed more than $12 
billion in complex transactions designed to heighten the fund's return if 
interest rates held firm or fell -- the bet that boomeranged on the fund when 
rates began climbing early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city of Irvine broke ranks with the county, announcing that it was 
withdrawing $25 million in retirement money from the fund and would sue if the 
county tried, as it has threatened, to withhold 20% to cover eventual losses. 
Irvine officials said they had decided in October to withdraw money in January, 
but news of the portfolio's plunge prompted them to speed up their timetable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided it would be more prudent to take it out sooner because of what's 
occurred than to wait 30 more days," Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prices of bonds issued by Orange County and some county agencies dropped 
about 10%, and few of the county's bonds were sold Monday. "The whole Orange 
County market is off," said Steve Kelleher, bond trader with Sutro & Co. in San 
Francisco. "Nobody is buying and nobody is selling. We're just waiting, because 
this loss could just be the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
 * Moody's Investors Service announced that it had placed Orange County's 
investment pool under review. Standard & Poors, another major rating agency, 
already had put the county on a negative credit watch, a step before a possible 
downgrading of the county's credit rating. Lower ratings would raise the cost 
of borrowing for the county's government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly at risk are four local districts that borrowed as much as half 
their annual budgets to put in the fund, in hopes of reaping badly needed 
revenue. Although they say the treasurer's office lured them into the 
investment last year with a special guarantee of protection, the districts have 
never received the promised written guarantee for this year's investment. 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials braced for the impact on county services and projects as a 
result of the fund debacle. Bert Scott, head of the county's General Services 
Agency, said Monday that he was concerned that any ratings downgrade would 
affect the county's ability to finance a $94-million law enforcement 
communications system that the supervisors were expected to approve this month. 
</P>
<P>
 With Citron gone, county officials and investors wondered Monday what to do 
next. Some officials privately expressed fears that only Citron truly 
understood his own financial game plan, which relied heavily on borrowing money 
short-term to invest in longer-term bonds, using investors' funds as 
collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 While interest rates remained low, Citron's plan worked extremely well, 
bringing in some of the highest yields paid by any governmental investment 
pool. But this year proved disastrous for the fund: Interest rates soared, 
undermining the value of the long-term bonds that Citron had used as collateral 
for the short-term borrowings and shrinking the worth of the notes he bought 
with the borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Citron had leveraged $7.8 billion worth of securities from cities, 
school districts and other public agencies into a portfolio worth nearly three 
times that amount, his losses have been magnified. Securities firms that made 
many of the loans demanded that the county put up more cash as collateral, 
eating into the fund's cash reserves, which declined from about $1.5 billion in 
August to less than $350 million in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by Kemper Securities noted that investors in a $110-million bond 
issue sold by the county in September could demand their money back on seven 
days notice -- a provision which, if exercised, could add to the county's cash 
crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron did not attend Monday's meeting, spending most of the day at his Santa 
Ana home. Peering through the stained glass bordering his front door, he told a 
reporter that he had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, whose campaign 15 years ago to win new leeway for county treasurers 
made possible the leveraged investments that made his fund the envy of its 
competitors and then caused his spectacular downfall -- will draw a pension of 
$89,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials praised Citron for building a fund that for years outperformed 
other government investment pools, bringing needed revenues to participating 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made almost $1.4 million in the last 3 1/2 years by investing in the 
county pool over what we would have made with the state pool -- $1.4 million," 
said Laguna Beach City Manager Ken Frank, whose city has invested about $7 
million in the fund." 
</P>
<P>
 But others were less complimentary. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that Bob has all the information and knows what is going on," 
said Peer Swan, chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District, which earlier 
threatened to withdraw the district's remaining $300 million if it does not get 
a voice on a proposed financial advisory board that would oversee the pool's 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have access to that information," he said, adding that "it is 
critical that Bob be on our side." Experts have speculated that the county has 
little choice but to make more big investments in so-called derivatives to 
counterbalance its bad bet on interest rates -- a step that could prove 
politically unpalatable, if financially necessary, under current circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city finance officials said they were sitting tight and refraining from 
withdrawals that they feared might cause a "run on the bank" and jeopardize 
their cities' investments. They said they could not afford to take the 20% loss 
that county officials are projecting. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials added, however, that they did not intend to continue making 
deposits into the now-controversial fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine on Monday became the first city to demand the return of a large chunk 
of its investment, announcing that it was withdrawing $25 million of the $209 
million it has invested in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Brady said the City Council will meet Wednesday to consider 
taking legal action if the county insists on the 20% penalty it has said it 
will impose on withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not believe it is legal," Brady said, adding that if the penalty were 
assessed "we may want to test that in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach City Treasurer Dan Watson said the news of Citron's 
resignation left him more concerned than before. "If I thought he had good 
solutions or potential solutions or (could) work his way out from under this, 
I'm not sure he would have offered his resignation." The city has about $43 
million invested in the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said Huntington Beach was not withdrawing money, but would no longer 
have property tax revenues automatically deposited in the pool. The last such 
deposit was made Tuesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, sent investigators to 
Citron's offices in Santa Ana to sort through documents. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC investigators were said to have turned up some preliminary indications 
that securities may have been improperly used as collateral for the fund's 
loans. While these securities were supposed to have been set aside as security 
for just one borrowing, they may have been used simultaneously, and illegally, 
to secure other loans. But the sources offered no details. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC investigators also were said to be exploring the possibility of other 
types of wrongdoing by the fund, although sources said no firm evidence had 
been uncovered so far. For example, the SEC was attempting to rule out that 
borrowed money may have been used to pay investors who made withdrawals from 
the fund, or that borrowed money may have been used to meet margin calls on 
derivatives in the funds' portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said that any of the investors in the fund might file a lawsuit, 
asking a court to put the fund into receivership. In a receivership, a 
court-appointed official would be assigned to supervise the fund and make 
decisions about how money is paid out and invested. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's political opponent in his June race for reelection -- a certified 
public accountant who repeatedly had warned that the portfolio was highly 
leveraged -- was astonished by the news of the longtime treasurer's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't anticipate he would do it," said John M.W. Moorlach, of Costa Mesa. 
Citron won the June 7 election with 61.1% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach, who has stayed in the center of the controversy in recent days and 
offered his assistance to the county on Monday, would not say whether he would 
seek the position himself. "I just have to trust the supervisors to do what's 
best for the people and if they want to ask me, I would certainly consider it," 
he said.

 Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's 24-year career as a 
relatively low-profile public official has been largely successful. 
</P>
<P>
 * ELECTION: First elected county tax collector in 1970. Became treasurer in 
1973 when Board of Supervisors combined the positions. 
</P>
<P>
 * POLITICS: Only elected Democrat in Orange County government. Ran unopposed 
between 1970 and 1994 but faced unsuccessful election challenge in June primary 
from Republican John M.W. Moorlach, who blasted his investment strategy as 
risky. 
</P>
<P>
 * MOST RECENT ANNUAL SALARY: $100,339 
</P>
<P>
 * INVESTORS: Citron managed funds from 185 cities, school districts and other 
government agencies. Yields from his investment pool have been consistently the 
highest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * BRANCHING OUT: Successfully lobbied the state in the 1970s to expand the 
investment options of government agencies. Citron's success over the years 
lured Santa Barbara and other municipalities from outside Orange County, along 
with nearly all local agencies, to contribute to investment pool. In the 
county, only San Juan Capistrano and Garden Grove did not contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 * INVESTMENT STRATEGY: Relied heavily on using investment pool's Treasury 
bills and bonds as collateral to borrow short-term at low interest rates, and 
investing the borrowed funds in mid-term corporate bonds and securities that 
pay higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * RETURNS: Averaged 9.03% return during the past decade, nearly double that of 
some comparable investment pools. However, in the past three years, returns 
have declined steadily, dropping as interest rates increased. 
</P>
<P>
 * BEST PERFORMANCE: 16.9% in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 * RECOGNITION: Named by the trade magazine City & State as one of the best 
county finance officers in the nation in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 * CURRENT STATUS: Citron announced his resignation Monday, less than a week 
after disclosures that his risky investment strategy led to a $1.5-billion drop 
in the county's portfolio.

GINGRICH ELECTED SPEAKER AS NEW DISPUTE RAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House Republicans officially anointed Rep. Newt Gingrich as field commander of 
their conservative revolution Monday but the combative Georgian found himself 
embroiled in controversy because of his caustic commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as House Republicans chanted "Newt, Newt, Newt" after his election as 
House Speaker, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta and others were 
furiously replying to Gingrich's suggestion Sunday that as much as one-fourth 
of the White House staff had used drugs before joining the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come when he has to understand that he has to stop behaving like 
an out-of-control radio talk-show host and begin behaving like the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives," an angry Panetta told reporters invited into his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot do business with the Speaker of the House, who is going to engage 
in these kind of unfounded allegations," Panetta said. "He's got to abide by a 
higher standard here." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich has said on several occasions in recent weeks that as Speaker he 
would have to temper his aggressive approach and assume a more-statesmanlike 
role than the highly partisan one he played as a leader of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said Sunday that a senior law enforcement official he did not name 
had told him that "in his judgment, up to a quarter of the White House staff, 
when they first came in, had used drugs in the last four or five years." 
</P>
<P>
 The charge and the sharp White House response seemed to overwhelm any 
protestations of good-will that the two parties had offered since the Nov. 8 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish many of their goals, Republican leaders need the support of 
congressional moderates on both sides of the aisle -- and of the White House. 
By exercising his veto, President Clinton could frustrate GOP legislation or 
force Republican leaders to seek the votes of scores of Democrats for the 
three-fourths margins needed to override. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP leadership elections had a pep-rally quality, and an emotional 
Gingrich spoke for nearly an hour to more than 200 Republican colleagues in 
what some lawmakers likened to a presidential inaugural or convention address. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday we spent 2 1/2 hours just walking through rooms in the Capitol that 
the Democrats have never let us in before," he said to appreciative laughter. 
"And it was very exciting. It's a much bigger building than I realized." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting polls that suggest the majority of Americans have a favorable 
impression of the promises made in the Republican "contract with America," 
Gingrich said: "We were elected to keep our word. We will keep our word. . . . 
There will be fewer committees. . . . There'll be one-third fewer committee 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich also thanked his wife, Marianne, who he said had "endured more from 
the media and more from the process than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Gingrich, House Republicans elected another aggressive and 
occasionally vitriolic conservative, Rep. Richard Armey of Texas, to the No. 2 
position, House majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Gingrich protege, however, was defeated for the No. 3 leadership post 
of Republican whip. The job went to Texas Rep. Tom DeLay, not to Gingrich ally 
Rep. Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 In nominating Gingrich to be Speaker, Rep. Henry Bonilla, (R-Tex.) said that 
the selection "will go down in history as a turning point for America. Newt 
Gingrich is a visionary, a believer in basic values." 
</P>
<P>
 In seconding the nomination, Rep. Nancy L. Johnson (R-Conn.) called Gingrich 
"the most visionary thinker in politics today . . . a strategist and tactician 
of the first order." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the White House, the mood was different. As First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton showed off the executive mansion's Christmas decorations, she called 
Gingrich's charges "so unfair" and said she hopes the accusation was only "a 
momentary lapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta was less restrained, arguing that Gingrich's charges are part of a 
"troubling pattern" in which Republicans "engage in reckless accusations. They 
impugn the integrity of not only the President but now every member of the 
White House staff without facts, without evidence, without foundation." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said Gingrich's allegation "that 25% of the staff engaged in that kind 
of usage" in the years before coming to the White House was flatly wrong. But 
he conceded that a small number of White House staff members may have done so. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is, at best, a very, very small percentage," he said. "Those people have 
been subjected to an FBI background check and they are continuing to be subject 
to random drug testing." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to questions from Republican congressmen, the White House 
submitted written information to a House subcommittee claiming that "about 1%" 
of White House job applicants had indicated earlier drug use, the Washington 
Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Panetta said, Gingrich's intention was to imply that people who have 
used drugs in the past continue to use them now. "There is no one in the White 
House who uses drugs," he said. "If Newt Gingrich has evidence to the contrary, 
he ought to tell me about it; he ought to make it public and I'll fire them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich offered no apologies, saying that if he were Panetta he would be 
talking to senior law enforcement officials about the charges. "I am very 
surprised at the way Leon flew off the handle," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 He dismissed Panetta's statement that the White House might not be able to do 
business with him. "His comment was nonsense," Gingrich said. "I am 
constitutionally going to be the chief legislative officer of the House. I 
don't know who he's going to be chief of staff for if he doesn't want to 
negotiate with the Speaker of the House." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of Gingrich's Republican colleagues, however, seemed uneasy with the 
incoming Speaker's remarks and at least one chalked it up to Gingrich's 
inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll bet a year from now Gingrich does not say the things he says now," said 
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's close allies, however, suggested that the White House reaction was 
misplaced. "This White House is going to have to learn that they no longer have 
lap dogs on Capitol Hill," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Armey said that Republican leaders shared Gingrich's concerns and suggested 
that Clinton should replace Panetta if he could not work with Gingrich.

BROWN BLOCKS GOP ASSEMBLY TAKEOVER AS 1 REPUBLICAN BOLTS; LEGISLATURE: A 
PROLONGED DEADLOCK OVER THE SPEAKERSHIP COULD PARALYZE THE LOWER HOUSE. THE GOP 
LOSES ADVANTAGE WHEN A MEMBER SWITCHES TO INDEPENDENT STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Stunning the Capitol and throwing the Assembly into gridlock Monday, 
Democratic Assemblyman Willie Brown blocked the GOP from seizing control of the 
lower house by persuading a lone Republican to renounce his party affiliation 
and vote for Brown as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who has survived as Speaker for 14 years, matched Republican Leader Jim 
Brulte vote for vote as the 80-member house split with 40 voting for Brown and 
40 for Brulte. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadlock raised the prospect of a months-long battle for the speakership, 
leaving the house unable to appoint committees or act on legislation. Some 
members suggested a shared speakership with neither party in control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just kind of stuck here," said Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg 
(D-Sacramento). 
</P>
<P>
 Before Monday the Assembly had never failed to elect a Speaker, who is 
responsible for appointing committee chairs and controlling most other 
functions of the house, on the first day of the session. The lower house 
adjourned late Monday and planned to meet again today. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Republicans were openly angry and accused Brown of trying to "steal 
the election" after the Democrats lost numerical control of the house in the 
November election. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats noted that with Paul Horcher switching to independent, the GOP 
no longer had a majority in the Assembly. They also charged that Republican 
Richard Mountjoy from Arcadia was improperly voting in the Assembly because he 
intends to take a Senate seat he also won on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, Democrats and Republicans cast their votes for Speaker along party 
lines as their names were called out alphabetically by the clerk of the 
Assembly. But when the name Paul Horcher was called out, the assemblyman from 
Diamond Bar -- who was elected as a Republican -- slammed his fist on his desk 
and roared out, "Brown!" 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher's emphatic vote stunned the chamber. Republicans won 41 seats in the 
Nov. 8 election, giving them a slim majority for the first time in 25 years. 
But Horcher's switch meant that the GOP had failed to wrest the speakership 
from the Democrats -- at least for now. He later said that he was leaving the 
Republican Party to become an independent and that he was disenchanted with the 
rightward tilt of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 After the votes were in, Democrats huddled around Horcher, shaking his hand, 
patting him on the back and shielding him from angry Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the afternoon, Horcher was escorted from the floor by Assembly 
security guards because of death threats received at his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher's vote appeared to be a surprise to many of those on the Assembly 
floor and gallery, although it was not a surprise to Brown, who has been wooing 
Horcher for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was bought fair and square by the Speaker (Brown)," alleged Assemblyman 
Trice Harvey (R-Bakersfield), who went on to call Horcher a "political whore." 
When Democrats demanded that Harvey retract the statement and apologize, Harvey 
responded, "I'm sorry he's a whore." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte, of Rancho Cucamonga, was still fuming at day's end over what he viewed 
as a double-cross. He said he was assured by Horcher's chief of staff that the 
wayward Republican would vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a Willie Brown independent," Brulte said sarcastically. "His district is 
contiguous to mine and I don't think Willie Brown independents are going to be 
real popular down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, hoping for the first time in his tenure to have a Republican 
Speaker, was more temperate. "We were a little less than pleased, I can say, 
with Mr. Horcher," said Sean Walsh, Wilson's spokesman. "We have the utmost 
respect for Speaker Brown. . . . But clearly the governor's preference is to 
have a Republican Legislature there." 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher said Brown promised him nothing for his vote, adding: "No one is ever 
going to try and buy or sell my vote." Brown also said no deal had been made, 
but when asked what role Horcher would play if Brown retains the speakership, 
said, "I can assure you it will be an enhanced one." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Brulte and Brown insisted that they would emerge victorious in the 
political brawl, although neither could say how the end might come. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be resolved," said Brown in a brief interview, "when the parties on 
both sides of the aisle understand that a house with such a small difference 
cannot operate without some basic understanding about every aspect of the 
control and delivery system." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one Democrat, Dominic Cortese of San Jose, said he was considering 
voting for Brulte, but not until Brulte obtains one other vote. Brown's allies, 
meanwhile, were hoping to persuade Doris Allen (R-Cypress) to switch her vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity for moderates to have their say," Cortese said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly arrived in the Capitol for the start of a new session with only 
two orders of business at hand: swearing in of members and electing a new 
Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-termers and the returning members brought their children, spouses, 
nannies and parents to witness this high point in their political lives, and 
then had planned to leave to savor their new offices at receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The day began on a note of collegiality with Republicans and Democrats 
congratulating one another on their election victories. In the opening prayer, 
the pastor called on the politicians to put aside partisan concerns for the 
betterment of the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
 But the session quickly degenerated into name calling, and charges that Brown 
was trying to thwart the electorate. Late in the afternoon, Brown asked that 
the Assembly recess until Jan. 4. But Republicans were not willing to give up 
quite so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to steal an election in private," an angry Assemblyman Ross 
Johnson (R-Placentia) told Brown, refusing to agree to adjourn. "You're going 
to steal it in public out here in front of God and the television cameras and 
everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 As family members left the ornate chamber, Brown and Brulte milled and 
conferred with the members, trying to convince one or more of them to bolt 
their party and break the deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is stuff people hate," said freshman Assemblyman Wally Knox (D-Los 
Angeles). "I just hope we get down to business." 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Horcher announced that he was now one of three 
independents in the Legislature. Indicating that he was wrestling with his 
decision until the end, Horcher said he had prepared a second statement -- one 
he did not release -- in the eventuality that he decided to stick with the GOP 
and vote for Brulte. 
</P>
<P>
 In the statement he did release, Horcher enumerated many wrongs he believes 
the GOP had inflicted on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately," Horcher's statement said, "the right wing of the Republican 
Party is in control of the Assembly Republican caucus. . . . Assisting these 
individuals in gaining control of the Assembly would be detrimental to the 
needs of my district." 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher signaled that he was not with the GOP program early in the day when he 
failed to attend a private conference of the Assembly Republicans in the 
governor's office before the session. 
</P>
<P>
 But on leaving the private morning caucus, Brulte expressed confidence that he 
would emerge as Speaker with Horcher's help, saying, "Horcher is with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Republicans have threatened Horcher with a recall. The Rev. Louis 
Sheldon, director of the conservative Christian Traditional Values Coalition, 
which helped elect several Republicans to the Legislature, was more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Horcher doesn't vote straight (for Brulte), Jesse Helms' comment about 
Clinton going to North Carolina will sound like Sunday school talk," Sheldon 
said before the session, referring to Helms' comment last month that President 
Clinton should bring a bodyguard if he travels to a military base in North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte, 38, had engineered the Election Day upset that saw Republicans gain 
eight seats in the Assembly and seize a majority in the lower house. But he was 
unable Monday to carrying the GOP victory at the polls to the next step -- 
electing a Republican Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brulte, beginning his fifth year in the Assembly, has demonstrated an 
ability to raise money and win elections, he cannot match Brown's experience. 
Brown, entering his 31st year in the Assembly, has seen and been involved in 
many speakership fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice before, Brown, 60, used Republicans to achieve and maintain control of 
the house. He won the powerful post in 1980 with the help of Republicans, and 
fought off a serious challenge mounted by conservative Democrats and 
Republicans to his speakership several years later by persuading Republicans to 
side with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had insisted since the Nov. 8 election that Brulte lacked the 41 votes 
needed to become Speaker, implying that the speakership vote would end tied at 
40-40. 
</P>
<P>
 Delay in a resolution works to the Democrats' favor. Richard Mountjoy was 
elected to the Assembly and also won a special election to a state Senate seat 
on Nov. 8. He insisted he intends to remain in the Assembly until the 
speakership is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 But as soon as Mountjoy leaves for the Senate, the number of Republicans 
supporting Brulte as Speaker would fall to 39, leaving Brown with a majority of 
those remaining and perhaps the speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Democrats demanded that Mountjoy vacate his seat immediately, and 
Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) attempted to win passage of a rule denying 
Mountjoy the right to vote for Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 In the upper house, where Democrats hold a one-seat majority, Senate leader 
Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) gave no indication of whether he intends to pressure 
Mountjoy to take his seat in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a current plan other than to consult with my colleagues and 
legal counsel," Lockyer said. "We'll wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate organized itself Monday for the new 1995-96 session and reelected 
Lockyer as president pro tem. In a symbolic gesture, newly emboldened minority 
Republicans tried to replace Lockyer with veteran GOP leader Ken Maddy of 
Fresno but failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The action struck a stark partisan tone in the traditionally staid Senate. The 
GOP increased its number in the Senate to 16 -- 17 with Mountjoy. There are 21 
Democrats and two independents. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the Senate, conservative Republicans ousted moderate GOP Sen. William 
Craven of Oceanside from his post as one of two Republicans on the powerful 
Senate Rules Committee, and replaced him with conservative Sen. John Lewis of 
Orange. Even as he retained his Assembly seat, Mountjoy said he participated in 
private Senate Republican discussions over Craven's ouster. The three other 
members of the committee are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have their favorites and I'm not one of them," said Craven, a critic of 
politically conservative Christian politicians.

INFORMATION GAP REVEALED ON BOND BORROWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County got a glowing review this summer from Moody's Financial 
Services, one of the nation's leading bond-rating agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm praised the county's "conservative fiscal practices" and took special 
note of its investment pool, whose "strong investment earnings . . . buoyed" 
its sizable financial reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, that pool is known to be running a paper loss of $1.5 billion 
-- precisely because of its dabbling in some of Wall Street's most volatile and 
non-conservative transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Moody's was hardly alone in missing the problems lurking in Orange County's 
portfolio. But its miscue is evidence of what top authorities are calling the 
key public policy issue brought into focus by the county's investment debacle: 
a disturbing lack of information about the complex borrowing being done by 
thousands of municipalities today. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rules for what a corporation must disclose to its investors have 
been well understood for years, the standards of market disclosure for states, 
cities, towns, counties and special districts are much fuzzier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The municipal bond market has been an unregulated market since its 
inception," Jeff Spies, treasurer of St. Petersburg, Fla., and an acknowledged 
authority on municipal finance, wrote in a recent issue of Treasury Notes, the 
monthly organ of the Municipal Treasurers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the individual investor buys a municipal bond in the secondary market, 
there is very little current information on which to base the investment 
decision," Spies said. "Also, when the need arises to sell that bond, there is 
little information on its value in the market." 
</P>
<P>
 In part, this is because municipal bonds are much less actively traded than 
corporate bonds, for which market prices are almost always available. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem also has arisen because municipalities only recently have been 
forced by limitations on their taxing power and by rising expenses to look to 
the investment markets for revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 While most states have enacted investment codes that dictate what a local 
agency may or may not have in its portfolio, "most of these codes were written 
before the investment markets were as complex as they are today," said Amy 
Doppelt, senior director of the public finance department of Fitch Investors 
Service, another bond-rating house. "So it's not always clear whether a certain 
transaction is permitted or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the riskiness of the newfangled municipal finance sometimes has 
nothing to do with where an agency actually put its money. Some of Orange 
County's potential losses come from its investments in "derivatives" -- complex 
instruments keyed to the movement of interest rates. Those investments proved 
to be losers when rates began rising instead of falling, as the pool had bet. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the fund's money is in what essentially are safe U.S. government 
bonds and notes. It is the structure of those investment deals -- including the 
fact that the county borrowed almost twice the pool's worth to try to multiply 
its gains -- that has generated the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Doppelt said, the question of how a municipality actually invests 
bond proceeds has not been high on the list of facts that must be disclosed to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the case in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 When Orange County school districts and other public agencies went to the 
market this summer with more than $1 billion in short-term notes -- much of 
which was to be reinvested in the county pool -- the bond-rating services paid 
scant attention to the condition of the pool itself, though its health may 
prove to be the single most important factor in the agencies' ability to pay 
the bonds' principal and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the agencies followed the county's lead, focusing on such extraneous 
factors as Orange County's demographic mix. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, S&P -- perhaps the biggest of the bond-analysis services -- 
assigned high ratings to about $350 million in short-term notes issued this 
summer. Although "recession has taken its toll," S&P noted, "income levels (in 
the county) are high, with median household effective buying income at 127% of 
the state level and 144% of the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 That appraisal reflected the mix of information available in the county's own 
prospectuses -- documents intended for use by people and institutions 
contemplating the purchase of the county's notes and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In disclosure materials for a $600-million short-term issue in July, the 
county devoted six pages to such factors as personal income, public school 
enrollments and population growth -- and scarcely a page to the investment 
pool, where the proceeds of the note sale were to be invested. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the discussion of the fund itself seems to have slighted its high -- 
and increasing -- risk. While noting the pool's enviable investment returns for 
the previous four years, the disclosure statement mentioned the downside only 
in passing, and then only by noting that the pool's reverse repurchase 
agreements -- complex transactions that borrowed money for the county to 
reinvest -- "may serve to increase the volatility" of the fund. (Volatility is 
the rate at which an investment's value fluctuates, up or down.) 
</P>
<P>
 Among the facts that the prospectus did not mention was that by the time of 
the notes' issuance, the fund may already have paid more than $300 million in 
cash to investment bankers to cover declines in its holdings' value. Also not 
noted was that those reverse repurchase agreements amounted to more than $12 
billion in borrowings, overwhelming the $7.5 billion in cash actually invested 
by the fund's participating agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Public officials, such as county treasurers, often exert control over as much 
or more money than private investment managers, but they are subject to much 
less regulatory scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the offices of the state treasurer and state controller said 
Monday that they have no jurisdiction over local governments' investment 
practices, although officials said the attorney general's office could step in 
if a local treasurer clearly exceeded his legal authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of oversight leaves investors dependent on reports by private 
analysts, such as Moody's, Standard and Poor's and Fitch, which themselves 
often are privy to -- or make use of -- only what information bond issuers want 
them to have. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Orange County's investment pool has become Exhibit A for the argument 
that not just the nature of disclosure but its depth is important. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal bond investors interviewed Monday said county officials did nothing 
to hide the exotic and aggressive nature of their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you went to the county, they were thrilled to tell you," says one 
institutional investor who avoided buying county notes and wishes to remain 
unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
 But only investors who applied their own sophisticated analysis to the figures 
provided by the county could have divined the scale of the market risk 
represented in its portfolio of arcane financing deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was the only person even worried about this," said the 
institutional investor. "The rating agencies continued to cite the pool as a 
positive credit factor." 
</P>
<P>
 S&P and Moody's both have said they are reviewing the ratings of existing 
Orange County notes and bonds, as well as those of agencies with money in the 
county investment pool. Neither has yet downgraded any ratings. In a statement 
issued Monday, Moody's said it has been "in close contact with county 
officials" and will meet with them later this week, at which time the firm 
"expect(s) to discuss the situation in greater detail." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months the Securities and Exchange Commission and other financial 
overseers have begun moving toward requiring greater disclosure of investment 
risks by municipalities issuing bonds and notes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an advisory issued last month, the SEC said it would require municipalities 
to make at least an annual disclosure of the nature of their investments in 
so-called derivatives and other risky investments.

BENTSEN SAID TO BE READY TO STEP DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, the Clinton Administration's elder statesman 
and chief spokesman on economic policy, plans to resign after the first of the 
year, senior Administration sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 He is expected to be succeeded by Robert E. Rubin, chairman of the National 
Economic Council and a senior economic policy adviser in the White House. 
Bentsen's decision to return to the private sector also appears to end the 
possibility that he might replace Warren Christopher as secretary of state, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's departure will leave a gaping hole at Treasury at a time when the 
White House is searching for ways to recapture the initiative from the 
Republican Party. No one else on President Clinton's team has the stature on 
Capitol Hill that the former Texas senator enjoys or has his commanding public 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Bentsen, 73, has played a critical role in most of the 
Administration's major successes -- its deficit-reduction plan, passage of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement and endorsement by Congress last week of 
the new world trade accord. Above all, he provided a reassuring presence for an 
Administration that often has had trouble developing a coherent policy agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had a Midas touch. Everything he's devoted himself to has turned to 
reality," observed one senior official in the Administration. "No one in the 
Administration has the relationship with Congress that he has. Nobody is 
indispensable, but losing Bentsen is like the Kansas City Chiefs trying to play 
without Joe Montana." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, a wealthy former co-chairman of the Wall Street investment firm of 
Goldman Sachs, has the respect of the financial markets and shares Bentsen's 
moderate views on the importance of free trade and the need for significant 
deficit reduction. But he lacks Bentsen's long experience in Washington and is 
a relative neophyte in dealing with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's resignation and Rubin's appointment have not been announced, 
although Bentsen refused to deny reports of his departure after a speech in 
Washington Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to retire because I think you just rust away," Bentsen said. 
"As to when I will leave Washington, I can paraphrase Mark Twain and say the 
news is premature. You'll be among the first to know when it is news." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen did not want to make a definitive statement about his plans with 
Clinton out of the country Monday, sources said, noting that a precise date for 
the resignation has not been set. In a senior staff meeting at the White House 
Monday, Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said that the timing of the announcement 
is being left to Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that there are two leading candidates within the Administration 
to succeed Rubin at the National Economic Council if he moves to Treasury -- 
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, 
and Erskine Bowles, now deputy White House chief of staff and formerly head of 
the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to Bentsen stressed that his decision to leave does not reflect 
dissatisfaction with Clinton's policies. Yet it was clear that Bentsen was 
uneasy with the chaotic White House decision-making process and often found it 
difficult to slow down or alter what he considered disastrous policy decisions 
by injecting himself into marathon White House gabfests. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he sometimes found himself as chief Administration spokesman on 
policies with which he was in fundamental disagreement. That was especially 
true with health care reform, the cornerstone of the Clinton agenda. At one 
point during the health care debate, Bentsen refused to testify before Congress 
in support of the Administration's health care proposal because he believed 
that the numbers behind the package had not been thoroughly researched. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, officials said that Bentsen is concerned about the appearance that he 
is abandoning the President at a political low point. "Of course he is 
concerned about that and that is one reason the timing still has not been 
finalized," noted one source. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Bentsen's resignation is likely to come as the Whitewater 
controversy, which embroiled his department last summer, appears about to be 
revived. While it is unclear whether Republicans in Congress plan to reopen 
their inquiry into events at the Treasury related to Whitewater, the 
confirmation hearings of Bentsen's successor could be a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Treasury officials -- deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman and Treasury 
general counsel Jean Hanson -- were forced to resign after last summer's 
Whitewater congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen was seen as one of the only members of the Administration who was held 
in high regard by Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike -- and his value to 
the Administration was only enhanced by the Republican landslide in November. 
Alone in the Administration, Bentsen can claim close ties to Republican leaders 
like Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the incoming Senate majority leader, and Sen. Bob 
Packwood of Oregon, the next chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm mystified by the timing of this, because Bentsen is one of the only 
people in the Administration who has good relations with Republicans on the 
Hill," observed William Kristol, chairman of the Project for the Republican 
Future. "It sends a very bad signal to Republicans if President Clinton is 
keeping Warren Christopher and losing Lloyd Bentsen." 
</P>
<P>
 First elected to the House in 1948 and to the Senate in 1970, Bentsen ran 
unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1976 and was the Democratic nominee for 
vice president in 1988. He was Clinton's first Cabinet choice, and his 
selection was seen at the time as a reassuring bow by Clinton to Wall Street 
and congressional moderates. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, who resigned his Senate seat to join the Clinton Cabinet in 1993, had 
long told associates that he planned to resign when his last Senate term would 
have expired -- in January, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "His decision (to resign) is in concordance with that decision to leave the 
Senate after his last term," noted one source.

BROADER NATO MAY BRING 'COLD PEACE,' YELTSIN WARNS; EUROPE: RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
ACCUSES U.S. OF BEING POWER HUNGRY. SPEECH COMES AS NATIONS FINALIZE NUCLEAR 
TREATY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER and DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caustically suggesting that Washington wants to run the world, Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin told President Clinton on Monday that a U.S.-led 
plan to expand NATO threatens to plunge Europe "into a cold peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "History demonstrates that it is a dangerous delusion to suppose that the 
destinies of continents and of the world community in general can somehow be 
managed from one single capital," Yeltsin said in his speech to a summit of the 
53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's speech rekindled Cold War tensions on a day in which the United 
States, Russia and three other former Soviet republics finally completed the 
complex ratification process for the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks treaty 
signed in 1991 after a decade of U.S.-Soviet negotiations. The treaty requires 
destruction of almost half of the nuclear weapons in the Washington and Moscow 
arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's outburst -- combined with an anguished protest from Bosnian 
President Alija Izetbegovic that the failure of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and the United Nations to prevent Serbian aggression in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has discredited the United Nations and ruined NATO -- struck 
a discordant note in what otherwise was a bland but optimistic assessment of 
the past successes and future prospects of the CSCE, an organization of 
European and North American countries created two decades ago as a Cold War 
bridge between East and West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian president spoke immediately after Clinton delivered an upbeat 
assessment of post-Cold War Europe, saying that the blood-soaked 20th Century 
can give way to a new century of peace and prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The end of the Cold War presents us with the opportunity to fulfill the 
promise of democracy and freedom," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Washington's chosen instrument for ensuring European security in the 21st 
Century -- a gradual expansion to the East of the 16-nation NATO -- drew a 
blunt rebuke from Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hear explanations to the effect that this is allegedly the expansion of 
stability, just in case there are undesirable developments in Russia," Yeltsin 
said sarcastically. "If the objective is to bring NATO up to Russia's borders, 
let me say one thing: It is too early to bury a democratic Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials generally offered a low-key response to Yeltsin's comments. One 
senior official suggested that the remarks were directed at Russian public 
opinion, while other officials said that Yeltsin and other Russian leaders take 
a much more relaxed view of NATO expansion in private than Yeltsin's speech 
would imply. 
</P>
<P>
 Western European officials also downplayed the harsh implications of Yeltsin's 
remarks. "It was very moderate and almost philosophical; it was the minimum 
that a Russian president would have to say in such a situation," one German 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Central Europeans knocking eagerly at NATO's door said they fear that 
Yeltsin is bent on slowing down, if not stopping, the Atlantic Alliance's 
eastward expansion. Without mentioning Russia by name, Polish President Lech 
Walesa said no country should be given veto power over another country's 
application to NATO, sentiments echoed by Clinton in his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 One Central European diplomat said former Warsaw Pact members fear that 
Yeltsin's tough talk could introduce a new element of uncertainty into NATO's 
expansion plans at a time when the alliance can ill-afford more turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may just want to delay any new members from joining NATO," a Hungarian 
diplomat said. "But in this world, when you delay something, who knows what 
could happen in the meantime?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Yeltsin emphasized cooperation and camaraderie during the separate 
ceremony marking the final approval of the START I treaty. The pact was signed 
in 1991 by former President George Bush and former Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev just before the Soviet Union disintegrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The effective date of the treaty was held up by the Ukrainian Parliament, 
which only last month agreed to renounce nuclear weapons and join the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty. Under a plan worked out in May, 1992, Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan and Belarus -- the three non-Russian republics that held Soviet 
nuclear weaponry -- agreed to go non-nuclear, leaving Russia with all of the 
arms the treaty allowed the Soviet Union to keep. Kazakhstan and Belarus had 
ratified the agreement earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The final approval of START I clears the way for ratification by the U.S. 
Senate and the Russian Parliament of START II, signed in 1993, which requires 
the United States and Russia to reduce total nuclear warheads to no more than 
3,500, less than one-third of the Cold War level. Clinton and Yeltsin also 
agreed to begin negotiations for additional reductions once START II is 
ratified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we herald the arrival of a new and safer era," Clinton said. He said 
the steps "amount to one great stride to reduce the nuclear threat to ourselves 
and to our children." 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials said the ceremony had "hung in the balance" until the early 
hours of Monday morning, when Russia and Ukraine finally worked out a dispute 
over a provision attached to the treaty by the Ukrainian Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spent only about six hours in Budapest before flying home to play host 
Monday night to a reception for members of the outgoing Democratic Congress. 
Before heading to the airport, the President met briefly with Bosnia's 
Izetbegovic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. He also conferred with 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But U.S. officials said he had no time for a 
separate meeting with Yeltsin, although the two men chatted during the nuclear 
arms signing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian officials said Clinton assured Izetbegovic that he would continue to 
apply pressure on the Bosnian Serbs through NATO. In his speech, Clinton urged 
the international community not to allow its "frustration over that war to 
cause us to give up our efforts to end it," and he again called on the Bosnian 
Serbs to accept an international peace plan and agree to a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Settle your differences at the negotiating table, not the battlefield," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his public remarks, Izetbegovic issued a stinging rebuke of international 
efforts to resolve the Bosnian war, saying the conflict is being prolonged 
because of the incapability, hesitation and ill will of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian president, who spoke while Clinton and Yeltsin were out of the 
room for the signing ceremony, said the war had "discredited" the United 
Nations, "ruined" NATO and "demoralized" Europeans trying to respond to the 
Continent's first post-Cold War crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more than a touch of irony in the fact that in front of this high 
forum of an organization created 20 years ago, with the aim of security and 
cooperation, . . . I have to speak about something completely opposite: 
insecurity and non-cooperation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech to the CSCE session, Clinton called for a greater role for the 
security organization but also described NATO as "the bedrock of security in 
Europe." He said the alliance's decision to expand, perhaps as early as 1996, 
will enhance security for all of Europe, members and non-members alike. 
</P>
<P>
 In an embarrassing slip of the tongue, Clinton described NATO as "an offensive 
organization." Officials later told reporters that he meant "defensive." 
</P>
<P>
 But Yeltsin was not convinced. "Russia also expects its security to be taken 
into account," Yeltsin said. "We are concerned about the changes that are 
taking place in NATO. What is this going to mean for Russia? NATO was created 
during the Cold War. Why sow the seeds of mistrust? After all, we are no longer 
enemies; we are all partners now." 
</P>
<P>
 As he left the gathering, Yeltsin got a quick lesson in the changed world 
order. The Russian president, without an overcoat in the afternoon cold, 
paraded through a throng of reporters and cameramen toward a waiting caravan of 
official vehicles. Yeltsin moved deliberately toward a shiny new Mercedes, only 
to discover the car was in fact designated for the Ukrainian delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin stepped back on the red carpet and put on his overcoat. Several 
vehicles picking up the Albanian delegation also passed by before Yeltsin's 
caravan arrived.

CITRON QUITS AS CRISIS DEEPENS; FEDERAL REGULATORS PORE OVER FUND RECORDS; 
FINANCE: O.C. TREASURER-TAX COLLECTOR RESIGNS POST HE HELD FOR 24 YEARS OVER 
$1.5-BILLION PLUNGE IN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. OFFICIALS CONTINUE CLOSED-DOOR 
SESSIONS.

 In the midst of a worsening financial crisis that has federal regulators 
poring over records of the county's beleaguered $18.5-billion investment fund, 
Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron resigned the position he 
had held for 24 years, officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months after winning a bitter electoral contest that focused on his risky 
investment strategies, Citron chose to step down rather than deal with the 
$1.5-billion loss suffered by the investment pool he managed for the county and 
more than 180 other public agencies across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "After much thought and soul-searching and with much regret, I have decided 
for the benefit of the County of Orange to resign my elected office," Citron, 
69, said in a two-sentence letter of resignation. Although it was given to the 
county's administrative officer Sunday, it was not revealed by county 
supervisors until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, Citron's assistants in the treasurer-tax collector's office were 
temporarily named to the top posts in the two departments. Matthew Raabe, 38, 
became acting treasurer and Gary Cowan the acting tax collector. Citron's 
permanent successor is not expected to be named before January, when he was due 
to begin a new four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad day, but Bob resigned in the best interests of the county," said 
James Kenan, finance director of the Orange County Transportation Authority, 
with more than $1 billion the largest single investor in the investment pool 
Citron managed. "From a financial market standpoint, I think he just wanted 
stability to return." 
</P>
<P>
 Following a two-hour, closed-door meeting of the Board of Supervisors, 
officials declined to discuss details of their deliberations, saying only that 
they would hold another closed session today to resume discussions about the 
financial crisis. In calling Monday's meeting, they cited the possibility of 
litigation over the losses as their reason for barring the public from the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments that came to light Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials disclosed that investigators from the Securities and Exchange 
Commission spent the weekend examining the county's portfolio and Citron's 
financial documents. Investigators were looking to see if the county illegally 
used borrowed money to pay investors who made withdrawals from the fund, or to 
meet so-called margin calls, which require additional cash to make up for the 
decreased value of securities the county pledged as collateral in seeking 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city of Irvine broke ranks with the county, and announced that it is 
withdrawing $25 million in retirement funds from the pool and would sue if the 
county tried to withhold 20% to cover eventual losses. Officials said they had 
decided in October to withdraw the money in January, but news of the 
portfolio's plunge prompted them to change their timetable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County bond prices dropped about 10% and few of the county's bonds 
were sold Monday. "The whole Orange County market is off," said Steve Kelleher, 
bond trader with Sutro & Co. in San Francisco. "Nobody is buying and nobody is 
selling. We're just waiting because this loss could just be the tip of the 
iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials already are worried that the fund debacle could jeopardize some 
county projects and programs. R.A. (Burt) Scott, the head of the county's 
General Services Agency, said Monday he was concerned that any downgrading of 
the county's bond rating would affect the county's ability to finance a massive 
$94-million law enforcement communications system the board was expected to 
approve this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Local school officials worried that they will be the biggest losers in the 
crisis. Unlike municipalities and special districts, which can invest their 
surplus funds in many different ways, school districts must keep all of their 
funds with the county treasurer. Four local districts that borrowed as much as 
half their annual budgets and put it into the fund to earn interest are 
particularly at risk. Although Citron's office lured them into the investments 
with a special guarantee their capital would be protected against any loss, the 
districts did not receive anything in writing extending the guarantee for this, 
the second year of the investment. County officials said there never were any 
such guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moody's Investors Service announced it has placed Orange County's investment 
pool under review. Standard & Poor's, the other major rating agency, has 
already put the county on a negative credit watch, a step prior to a possible 
downgrading of the county's credit rating. Lower ratings would raise the cost 
of borrowing for the county's government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 With Citron gone, county officials and investors wondered what to do next. 
Some officials privately expressed fears that only Citron, who was paid 
$104,353 a year, truly understood his own financial game plan, which relied 
heavily on borrowing money short-term to invest in longer-term bonds, using 
investors' funds as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 While interest rates remained low, Citron's plan worked extremely well, 
bringing in some of the highest yields paid by any governmental investment 
pool. But this year proved disastrous for Citron as interest rates soared, 
undermining the value of the long-term bonds he had used for collateral, as 
well as those he had bought with borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Citron had leveraged $7.8 billion worth of securities belonging to 
cities, school districts and other public agencies into a portfolio worth 
nearly three times that amount, his losses have been magnified. 
</P>
<P>
 Securities firms that loaned the county money demanded that the county put up 
more cash as collateral to guarantee the loans, digging considerably into the 
fund's available reserves, which declined from roughly $1.5 billion in August 
to less than $350 million two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the investment banking world are nervous about the developments of 
the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper Securities in Chicago published a report Monday that laid out the 
problems in Orange County and took particular note of a $110-million bond issue 
sold by the county in September. Buyers could demand that the bonds be redeemed 
on seven days' notice, adding to the county's cash crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron did not come to Monday's meeting, and spent most of the day at his 
Santa Ana home. Peering through the stained glass bordering his front door, he 
told a reporter who rang his doorbell that he had no comment to make. A 
messenger who said he had been dispatched to Citron's home by an unnamed county 
official brought Citron an envelope in late afternoon, and Citron took it 
through a crack in the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The former treasurer, who had held office longer than any other current county 
official, will draw a pension of $89,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials praised Citron and his ability over the years to bring needed 
extra revenues to governmental entities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the person should be judged on the whole history of his investment 
strategy," said Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank, whose city has 
invested about $7 million in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made almost $1.4 million in the last 3 1/2 years by investing in the 
county pool over what we would have made with the state pool -- $1.4 million." 
</P>
<P>
 But others were less complimentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Peer Swan, chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District -- which is threatening 
to withdraw $300 million from the pool if it doesn't get a voice on a proposed 
financial advisory board overseeing the pool's operations -- said he was 
concerned "that Bob has all the information" and appears to be the only person 
who "knows what is going on. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have access to that information," he said, adding that "it is 
critical that Bob be on our side. He had a long history of being good to the 
county, but there was no option (other than his resignation). The world 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 City councils throughout Orange County will be reviewing the status of their 
investments in the county pool and deciding how to react. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city finance officials said they were refraining from withdrawals that 
they feared might cause a "run on the bank" and jeopardize their cities' 
investments. They said they could not afford to take the 20% loss that county 
officials are projecting. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials added, however, that they did not intend to continue making 
deposits into the now-controversial fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Irvine, however, demanded a large chunk of its investment, 
announcing Monday that it was withdrawing $25 million of the $209 million it 
has invested in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said the City Council will meet Wednesday to 
consider taking legal action if the county insists on the 20% penalty it has 
said it will impose on withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
 There were hints that Irvine's reason for announcing a withdrawal now may be 
political as well as fiscal. One official suggested that the city may use this 
issue to leverage concessions from the county on other contentious issues, such 
as development of a commercial airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, 
which the city opposes. County voters approved the project in the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Councilman Barry J. Hammond stopped short of making an overt 
threat but listed El Toro as well as the city's proposed annexation of the base 
among the "good, strong deal points that can be discussed" between the city and 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just a lot of things going on and individuals always have to do 
what's best -- what's best for the community first and the county second." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady nonetheless sounded relatively supportive of Citron, declining, as he 
put it, "to get involved in all the politics" of the current situation. The 
county treasurer-assessor has "done a good job for us," Brady said. "Sometimes 
that gets lost in all the criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach City Treasurer Dan Watson said the news of Citron's 
resignation left him more concerned than before. "If I thought he had good 
solutions or potential solutions or (could) work his way out from under this, 
I'm not sure he would have offered his resignation." The city has about $43 
million invested in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Other city officials declined to pass judgment on Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least in part (Citron) has become a victim of both political statements 
and the media. . . . " La Habra City Manager Lee Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park Chief Financial Officer Greg Beaubien said he was "in favor of the 
county taking any steps necessary to deal with the situation." Even so, he 
said, "it's easy to throw stones at people." Buena Park has $18 million of city 
money and $10 million in redevelopment funds in the pool, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, sent investigators to 
Citron's offices in Santa Ana to cull documents. 
</P>
<P>
 There is concern that there could be a run on the fund, and that the ones who 
demand money first might get it, leaving less available for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, if there's a run, the rule is first-come, first-served, without 
attention to the relative equities of those who may not make a claim" 
immediately, said one of the SEC sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said any of the investors in the fund might file a lawsuit, 
asking a court to put the fund into receivership. In a receivership, a 
court-appointed official would be assigned to supervise the fund and make 
decisions about how money is paid out and invested. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC investigators were said to be looking at whether securities used as 
collateral for loans made to the fund may have been used improperly. While 
these securities were supposed to have been set aside as security for just one 
borrowing, they may have been used simultaneously, and illegally, to secure 
other loans. But the sources offered no details. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were also seeking to determine whether the fund is being adequately 
supervised now, and whether any payout of money from the funds would be made 
equitably among the various municipalities and agencies that are investors. 
Questions were also raised about possibly improper use of securities to 
collateralize loans the county sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Citron's political opponent in this year's race, who had repeatedly 
warned that the portfolio was highly leveraged, was astonished by the 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't anticipate he would do it," said John M.W. Moorlach, a Costa Mesa 
certified public accountant and financial planner who lost to Citron in the 
June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach, who wrote county officials Monday offering to sit on any committee 
that may be formed to oversee the operations of the pool, would not say if he 
would seek the position himself. More Coverage

 After nearly a quarter-century, Robert L. Citron's political career as Orange 
County's treasurer-tax collector came to an end Monday when the Board of 
Supervisors accepted his resignation. County Assistant Treasurer Matthew Raabe 
was appointed as treasurer until January, when a permanent successor will be 
named.

IN FUND CRASH, SCHOOLS COULD BE BIG LOSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Local schools could be the biggest losers in the crisis crippling the Orange 
County treasurer's investment fund, because of a state law that requires them 
to keep virtually all their money in the county pool, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As some agencies took steps toward withdrawing funds from the pool, which 
announced a stunning $1.5-billion plunge last week, school administrators urged 
a wait-and-see attitude and expressed hope that cities and special districts 
would consider the impact on the school system before making decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious and grave situation," Capistrano Unified School District 
Supt. James A. Fleming said. "The main thought I have is one of Angst ." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Rita Newman, assistant superintendent for business services in the 
Anaheim Union High School District: "We're stuck." 
</P>
<P>
 The County Department of Education fielded anxious phone calls from school 
administrators all day and planned a meeting Thursday for the 27 district 
superintendents and their finance experts to discuss the situation. Attorneys 
are researching whether schools have any option other than to stay in the pool, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa Unified School District Supt. Mac Bernd, whose district is one of 
four facing the greatest potential damage because they placed huge sums of 
borrowed money into the pool in hopes of raising badly needed revenue, said the 
key now is "sticking together." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the advice we get from all of our sources is that if the agencies 
involved stay in the pool, these will remain paper losses," said Bernd, whose 
district has $80 million invested with the treasurer's office. "This is a 
perfect example of when governmental agencies need to cooperate because we're 
all serving the same public." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa, Irvine Unified, North Orange County Community College District 
and the Orange County Department of Education each borrowed amounts equivalent 
to about half their annual budgets, investing $200 million with County 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's office in a special deal for the 
sole purpose of reaping profits through arbitrage. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other investments in the fund, this $200 million cannot be withdrawn 
until June under terms of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 While the treasurer's office gave the districts written and oral guarantees at 
the start of the special deal in 1993 that the overall county pool would back 
their investments so not a penny of the principal could be lost, county 
officials outside the treasurer's office said Monday they never authorized such 
a special guarantee. Several attorneys also questioned the legality of the 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating the situation, officials representing the four investors 
said Monday that they were assured the guarantee remained for the investment's 
second year, which began in June, 1994, but never received a letter expressing 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked if the same guarantee applied and were given a positive response," 
said Michael Fine, Newport-Mesa's director of fiscal services. "We asked if we 
would get another letter of guarantee and they said yes we would. But I don't 
have one in the file." 
</P>
<P>
 John Nelson, assistant superintendent of the County Department of Education, 
and Paul Reed, Irvine Unified's deputy superintendent for business, both also 
said they understood the guarantee to continue into the second year but never 
got it confirmed on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 But several attorneys raised concerns about the validity of either a verbal or 
written promise from the treasurer backing some investors' funds with other 
investors' money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would have to be in writing and authorized by the county. I find 
it difficult to believe that a verbal promise would be enforceable," said Bill 
Lerach, a San Diego lawyer who specializes in securities fraud. "I've never 
heard of a pooled investment arrangement where certain participants were 
guaranteed against loss while others were not. If I was an unguaranteed 
participant I don't think I'd be too happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph R. Symkowick, general counsel for the State Department of Education, 
agreed that the prospects for enforcing the guarantee are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "In theory, you can enter into contractual obligations that are like 
guarantees or warranties. You can buy an insurance policy for anything," he 
said. "But legally, how good is that guarantee? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa school board President Edward H. Decker said Monday he voted 
against the investment deal last spring partly because he did not believe the 
guarantee could hold up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it was in writing, what would Citron use to guarantee our funds? Did 
he have a stash somewhere?" Decker quipped Monday. "I never believed he could 
ultimately guarantee that, anyway, because it would just be a matter of taking 
money away from somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no mention of the special guarantee in a 22-page prospectus 
describing each district's investment plan to prospective buyers of the 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospectus lists the reason for the large loan as meeting expenses, makes 
no distinction between the special deal and routine borrowing by school 
districts throughout the state, and never mentions that the loans will be used 
for high-risk investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The marketplace doesn't care whether we're using it to get through the first 
week of December to meet our cash needs or to build up our reserves," Fine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa borrowed nearly $47 million for the investment. Irvine Unified 
borrowed about $54.5 million; the college district borrowed more than $56 
million; and the county department borrowed $42 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first year, the agencies each earned about $1 million for the deal, 
which they reinvested with the pool. The investment also has made money during 
the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As an added precaution during the second year of the investment deal, the four 
agencies bought an "insurance cap" that kicked in to cover losses when interest 
on their variable-rate loans rose above 5%. The cap cost each district between 
$200,000 and $300,000, and is now paying some of the interest on the districts' 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "One can certainly sit in the Monday-morning quarterback chair and criticize . 
. . but I think you have to look at the way things appeared when we made the 
investment," said Reed, the Irvine Unified financial manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling has been that our money is safer (in the county pool) than 
everywhere else we could place it," added Nelson. "I obviously trusted 
something I shouldn't have."

HIGH COURT SHOWDOWN ON HOMELESS ISSUE NEARS; SHELTER: STATE JUSTICES TO HEAR 
ARGUMENTS THURSDAY ON A SANTA ANA LAW THAT FORBIDS CAMPING ON PUBLIC PROPERTY. 
THE DECISION IS LIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPACT FOR CITIES ACROSS THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney general, a trio of retired state Supreme Court justices and 
some of the country's most prestigious constitutional law professors are 
throwing their weight behind the homeless here. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than 90 city attorneys from throughout California and several 
conservative legal foundations are standing behind the city of Santa Ana in a 
legal showdown scheduled for Thursday, when the state Supreme Court will begin 
its review of a city ordinance that prohibits camping or the storing of 
belongings on public property. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which critics say effectively expels the homeless from Santa Ana, was 
enacted in 1992 but overturned by a state appellate court that derided it as an 
unconstitutional "punishment for poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the attention of cities throughout California and the nation is riveted 
on the Santa Ana case, which legal experts say could eventually prompt the U.S. 
Supreme Court to help resolve the issue of anti-homeless ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that whether or not the regulations on the books in many 
cities will be allowed is going to depend on this case, and if this is allowed, 
there's no doubt that many cities are going to adopt similar ones," said Erwin 
Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at the USC School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, increasingly frustrated by growing homeless populations -- and the 
crime, public health hazards and eyesores that can accompany life on the street 
-- many cities have passed laws to push the homeless off public property. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami, Dallas, Baltimore, San Francisco and Seattle all have landed in the 
courts after adopting ordinances directed at the homeless in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 But homeless advocates say Santa Ana's case marks the first time the U.S. 
government has filed a brief on behalf of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the state's top court required to rule on the matter within 90 days 
of Thursday's oral arguments, legal experts say the opinion will be the first 
in the country from a court of this level on the constitutional questions 
raised by anti-camping laws. In addition, the breadth of the Santa Ana law -- 
which bans camping at all times on all public property -- also lends 
significance to a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the law say the appellate decision overturning Santa Ana's 
ordinance tied cities' hands in their efforts to govern and wrongly created a 
constitutional right to live on public property. 
</P>
<P>
 "If homeless people are given a constitutional right to camp, what does it do 
to the quality of life in our cities? What does it do to our liability?" asked 
Santa Ana Assistant City Atty. Robert Wheeler, who will argue the city's case 
in front of the state's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. E. Thomas Dunn Jr., who also will ask the 
court to overturn the appellate ruling, said the city "ought to have a right to 
keep (public areas) clean for the rest of us. There's no reason why there ought 
to be a Republic of the Homeless, like an abdication of a piece of territory to 
those who are above the law." 
</P>
<P>
 But those arguing on behalf of the homeless say there are many ways cities can 
keep public areas clean, including passing less restrictive laws banning 
camping in parks or forbidding people to erect shelters or tents -- both laws 
already on Santa Ana's books. 
</P>
<P>
 "By making it a crime to use sleeping bags and blankets in every public area 
of the city at a time when the city has a substantial population of people who 
have no place to house themselves, Santa Ana is essentially making it a crime 
to be homeless in the city," said Harry Simon, an attorney with the Legal Aid 
Society of Orange County, who will argue the case for the homeless with two 
other attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not claiming that the homeless are some sort of protected class. What 
we're saying is that this is a pretty transparent attempt to drive the homeless 
from the city," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the court upholds the law, homeless advocates warn, cities will scramble to 
enact similar ordinances for fear of becoming the enclave into which other 
cities force their poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange and Fullerton enacted similar laws after Santa Ana's but have not 
enforced them, under threat of litigation. Five other Southern Californian 
cities -- West Hollywood, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and Santa 
Barbara -- passed anti-homeless ordinances in the same 18-month period, said 
Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness 
and Poverty in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the homeless contend that Santa Ana's law violates the state and 
federal constitutions by punishing people because of their "status" as homeless 
and restricts their right to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of the ordinance say it legally punishes the conduct of living in 
public places, not the status of being homeless, and that many people choose to 
sleep outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana ordinance prohibits camping, use of camping equipment -- 
including sleeping bags or blankets -- or storage of any personal items on 
public property. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the city adopted the sweeping ordinance in 1992, hundreds of 
people had set up camp in the Civic Center area, erecting tents and shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the city's own estimate, there are 3,000 homeless people in Santa 
Ana and only 330 shelter beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety California city attorneys endorsing Santa Ana's position joined a 
friend of the court brief drafted by San Francisco Deputy City Atty. Michael E. 
Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Several conservative legal groups also are siding with Santa Ana, including 
the Pacific Legal Foundation and Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, both based 
in Sacramento, and the Washington, D.C.-based American Alliance for Rights and 
Responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you accept the basic premise from the court of appeal, then where do you 
draw the line? On a bad weather night, I suppose you'd have to make the 
argument that you have to open your public buildings to the homeless," said 
Anthony Caso of the Pacific Legal Foundation, which predominantly defends the 
rights of property owners. "Simply because an individual has a need, that's not 
converted into a right to be fulfilled at public expense." 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are high enough that the U.S. government argued in its 24-page 
brief, filed just last week, that the Santa Ana ordinance violates the 8th 
Amendment by "criminalizing homeless persons' sleeping in public even when no 
shelter is available." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has "a clear responsibility . . . to engender respect 
for the human dignity of the homeless," said the brief.

DENTAL X-RAYS CAN IDENTIFY STROKE RISK, RESEARCHERS SAY; MEDICINE: FILMS REVEAL 
CALCIFICATION OF THE NECK ARTERIES, ONE CAUSE OF THE AILMENT, TWO SURGEONS 
REPORT. PREVENTIVE STEPS INCLUDING MEDICATION AND SURGERY CAN THEN BE TAKEN. 
</P>

 Panoramic X-rays taken during a normal dental exam can identify patients with 
stroke-causing calcification of the neck arteries, opening the door to 
aggressive, life-saving treatment, according to researchers from UCLA and the 
Sepulveda Veterans Affairs Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Arthur Friedlander, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, and Dr. Dennis 
Baker, a vascular surgeon, studied panoramic X-rays -- 360-degree views of the 
mouth and neck areas -- from 295 VA patients who were older than 55 and had no 
symptoms of stroke. They found 10 with calcifications, they will report 
Wednesday in the Journal of the American Dental Association. These were 
patients, Friedlander said, whose calcification would have gone undetected 
until they developed symptoms or had a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 One patient underwent successful surgery and the other nine, who had less 
severe blockage, are receiving aggressive treatment to reduce risk factors for 
stroke, such as high blood pressure and smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the nine patients had previously refused to give up smoking or to take 
blood pressure medication, Friedlander said Monday, but became more cooperative 
when confronted with physical evidence of their increased risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a dramatic impact when they see in black and white that they have a 
problem," he said. "It's no longer abstract." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedlander is not arguing that people over 55 seek out the panoramic X-rays 
or be screened for stroke risk. Rather, he is urging dentists to check for 
calcification when they read the X-rays of a normal exam and to refer suspected 
cases to cardiologists. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 150,000 Americans die from strokes each year, and 85,000 of those 
deaths are the result of blood clots triggered by such calcification. 
</P>
<P>
 A National Institutes of Health study released in October reported that 
surgical intervention to remove the calcification, called a carotid 
endarterectomy, can sharply reduce the risk of stroke. But there are no 
organized programs to detect the blockages in patients without symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "With surgery being shown to be beneficial (in preventing strokes), there is 
clearly going to be an increased effort toward identifying the asymptomatic 
patient" with a blockage of the carotid arteries, said Dr. Wesley S. Moore, a 
UCLA vascular surgeon and member of the American Heart Assn.'s Council on 
Stroke. "This would certainly complement that effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Dentists already screen their patients for a variety of conditions ranging 
from oral cancer and sinus abnormalities to disorders of the salivary glands 
and temporomandibular joints, added Stuart White, a professor of dentistry at 
UCLA. "This is one more potential problem that they need to be aware of."

PLOWING UP BIG TROUBLE; AGRICULTURE: THE EPA SAYS A 60-ACRE FARMING VENTURE IN 
VENTURA COUNTY DESTROYED 23 ACRES OF WETLAND. THE OWNERS FACE STIFF 
COMPENSATION COSTS AND SAY THE FIELD LOST $50,000 IN ITS FIRST YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 When his truck jounces along the rough road past Conejo Ranch, farmer Jim 
Roberts sees a tidy field of baby vegetables -- the same kind of wispy, hopeful 
blooms that cloaked the field one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the Ventura County field looks just as it did last fall, Roberts 
views it differently. Where he once saw rich dirt and ripe potential, he now 
sees pain, frustration and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they planted the first seeds on Conejo Ranch during Thanksgiving week of 
1993, Roberts and partners Craig Underwood and Minos Athanassiadis have endured 
an astounding pileup of troubles on their 60-acre field. 
</P>
<P>
 Their biggest heartbreak: the federal Environmental Protection Agency recently 
determined that the farmers destroyed 23 acres of valuable wetland when they 
clear-cut, drained and leveled Conejo Ranch to prepare it for planting. 
</P>
<P>
 In a crushing verdict, the EPA ordered the partners to compensate California 
for the loss of key riparian habitat. They must either restore a large chunk of 
the field to its natural state or enhance a torn-up wetland elsewhere in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact penalty is likely to be determined during negotiations over the next 
several months. Depending on the settlement, the partners' tab could range from 
less than $100,000 to more than $2 million, according to wetland consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's harsh mandate is by far the worst blow of this tumultuous year. But 
the farmers have faced a fair share of other troubles as well. 
</P>
<P>
 They have skirmished with irate neighbors about a giant, stinking compost heap 
on a corner of Conejo Ranch. They have struggled to find markets in a 
competitive industry dominated by a few agribusiness giants. And they have 
watched part of a promising corn crop wither in the field when they could not 
unload the ears at decent prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, they cooed and clucked over Conejo Ranch as though it were a 
newborn. This year, they anguish and fret over the field as though it were a 
juvenile delinquent. The enterprise lost $50,000 in its first year. 
</P>
<P>
 All the tumult, Roberts mused, "changes the way you look at the land." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, all three partners fiercely believe they will survive, if they 
keep doing what they have been doing elsewhere for years. That includes farming 
Conejo Ranch, carrying on from season to season, waiting out the bad times and 
waiting for the good. As Roberts explained: "That's farming." 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer and fewer farmers these days can endure the ups and downs. The most 
recent U.S. census disclosed that the number of farms in the United States has 
dropped below 2 million for the first time since the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 2 million acres of agricultural land vanish each year, the 
rich soil buried under the concrete crust of development. 
</P>
<P>
 In launching Conejo Ranch, the partners were aware that they were bucking a 
national trend. They were proud of taking the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The field, tucked between scrub-spotted hills and a plant-lined creek, was 
vacant for a decade before the partners bought it in the spring of 1993. The 
farmers eagerly ripped out the helter-skelter growth and laid down neat 
furrows, an elaborate drainage system, shiny irrigation pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 "To us, it seemed like we were doing a really good thing," Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials, however, took a different view. 
</P>
<P>
 After a six-month investigation that wrapped up in late October, EPA 
biologists determined that the farmers had destroyed a unique riparian 
ecosystem linking the Santa Monica Mountains with nearby Conejo Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the ranchers did not know they were tampering with a wetland when they 
sent in their tractors, EPA biologist Aaron Setran said the agency will not 
press criminal charges. But the government will still exact a heavy toll, by 
demanding that the farmers replace the "values" of the destroyed habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the natural disasters we face pale before what state and federal 
regulators can do," said Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura County 
Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as much as the expense, the farmers resent the implication of the EPA's 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself an environmentalist," Roberts said. "That's why I do what I 
do -- to be outside, with nature. This just doesn't sit right." 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood added: "We thought we were doing an exceptional thing on Conejo 
Ranch. Sometimes you're not rewarded for doing things right." 
</P>
<P>
 But EPA biologists would argue that the farmers did not do things right. 
Before buying Conejo Ranch, they should have consulted with environmental 
experts, who might have warned them that the moist field, with its clusters of 
cattails and rushes, could fall under federal jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bart Doyle, a Los Angeles wetland attorney, explained: "In California, you 
should always assume some part of your land is regulated, no matter what you 
want to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, federal law would have allowed the farmers to do anything they 
wanted on Conejo Ranch if they had first drained the water and let the field 
dry up, according to several environmental attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clean Water Act prohibits only the "discharge" of material into a wetland. 
That covers any redistribution of soil in a wetland -- from digging a ditch to 
churning up earth with a bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
 But other destructive activities remain legal: chopping plants by hand, 
burning vegetation, even pumping out water, as long as no soil is shifted. If 
careful, land owners can legally destroy a wetland -- and then, once the parcel 
is dry, build or farm with impunity, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, to this day you can do all sorts of things in wetlands," San 
Francisco attorney David Ivester said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Ranch farmers could still challenge the EPA's decision. And they 
are tempted. But the thought of going up against a federal agency scares them. 
If they choose not to appeal in court, their only option is to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the EPA requires offenders to restore two acres of wetland for 
every one destroyed. The farmers could create a wetland corridor along their 
field's border, clear non-native shrubs from an overgrown creek bed, pump water 
into a dried-up pond or dream up some other project. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the complexity, wetland repair jobs can cost anywhere from $2,000 
to $60,000 an acre, environmental consultants said. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's open-ended instructions leave the farmers free to scout the cheapest 
way to pay their dues. But whatever option they choose, they will never be able 
to fully make up for the lost habitat, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a mosaic to that wetland . . . and you'll never, ever replace 
that," Setran said. "It was unique unto itself." 
</P>
<P>
 In planting Conejo Ranch, the partners fancied they were reinvigorating the 
land by reviving its agricultural roots. That respect for farming tradition, 
however, clashed with the environmentalists' respect for nature, which had 
reclaimed the land with flair in just one decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Ranch's planting foreman, Natividad Zavala, said the economic 
importance of the farm should be factored into the equation. 
</P>
<P>
 As his crew of harvesters crouched under a stormy November sky to pick 
carrots, Zavala said: "Look how many mouths you feed with this field. We have 
to do this to live. Of course, I don't want the animals to die. But I don't 
want myself to die either." 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring the wetlands could cost a bundle, Underwood insists: "We will not 
allow that piece of property to threaten the rest of our farming operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Conejo Ranch is the only property they own, the partners farm 22 
parcels of leased land in Ventura County. Profits from those fields more than 
made up for the losses at Conejo Ranch this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But they still hope to turn a profit on Conejo Ranch. They are counting on 
brisk sales of the field's most recent crop: baby carrots, with a sprinkling of 
red, gold and candy beets tossed in as well. The partners hope the carrots will 
swing the ranch back into the black, after a $100,000 loss from summer corn 
wiped out a $50,000 profit from last winter's crop of greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Underwood forecast a decent return for his company at year's end. The 
22 Ventura County fields that the partners rent and farm bailed out Conejo 
Ranch's loss on the corn crop. And the financial fallout from the EPA probe 
probably won't be felt until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 For enduring 12 months of turmoil, the partners will each earn about $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As Roberts concluded: "There will be a Christmas." About This Series 
</P>
<P>
 "60 Acres of Hope," a series that concludes today, has traced the first year 
of a new Southern California farming operation. Today's article wraps up the 
tumultuous year and looks ahead at the uncertain future of the 60-acre Ventura 
County field known as Conejo Ranch. The story also explores an Environmental 
Protection Agency ruling that the farmers must compensate the government for 
destroying a wetland area when preparing their field for planting. Previous 
articles have examined the mechanics and economics of farming, from planting to 
harvesting to marketing.

NAVY DISCIPLINES 3 FOR IMPROPER CONDUCT TOWARD FEMALE SAILORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three male sailors have been disciplined after an investigation into 
allegations by female sailors that they were sexually harassed by male 
instructors at the Naval Training Center in San Diego, the Navy announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. John Ensch, commander of the training center, said the investigation 
found "no evidence of sexual favors for course grades" but did find improper 
conduct between the ranks and between the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 One sailor, a chief petty officer, was demoted and fined a month's pay for 
fraternization and adultery because of a consensual relationship. Adultery is 
an infraction under the Unified Code of Military Justice if seen as prejudicial 
to good order and discipline. Fraternization is socializing between officers 
and subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other sailors were given warnings and counseling: a petty officer for not 
reporting improper conduct on the part of others and a fireman for burning a 
woman sailor's hair during classroom "horseplay." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three sailors whose punishment was announced Monday were found 
guilty of sexual harassment, a serious offense that can lead to dishonorable 
discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 More sailors may face punishment, Navy officials said. Some involved in 
alleged incidents had been transferred to other bases before the investigation 
began but will be returned to the Naval Training Center if enough evidence 
exists for punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged verbal harassment involved 16 women who were being trained to 
operate the Navy's computer and telephone network between March, 1993, and 
September of this year. Most of the 16 women were fresh from boot camp and 
receiving their first technical training before deployment. 
</P>
<P>
 The sailor punished for adultery was also restricted to base for 45 days and 
given a verbal reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment has been a major issue in the Navy since the scandal 
involving the Tailhook Assn. convention in Las Vegas in 1991, at which dozens 
of women were allegedly assaulted by Navy and Marine Corps aviators.

BID TO CUT QUAKE AGENCY IS CRITICIZED; FINANCES: SCIENTISTS CALL U.S. 
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY'S WORK VITAL. ITS ELIMINATION WOULD SAVE BILLIONS, SAYS 
INCOMING HOUSE BUDGET PANEL CHAIRMAN. 
</P>

<P>
 A proposal by the incoming Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee 
that calls for abolishing the U.S. Geological Survey as a money-saving measure 
stirred apprehension here Monday as 6,000 scientists gathered for the fall 
meeting of the American Geophysical Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of crazy," said Barbara Romanowicz, director of the UC Berkeley 
Seismographic Station and one of many academicians who depend on the 
115-year-old agency for its comprehensive monitoring of geophysical phenomena, 
especially earthquakes and volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how we can do away with these functions altogether," Romanowicz 
said. "You'd be back in the Dark Ages." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) first proposed eliminating the Geological Survey 
last year. But he was a minority member of a committee controlled by Democrats, 
and his idea stalled. During the recent congressional elections that brought 
the Republicans to power, he pushed it again as part of the GOP's "Contract 
With America." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasich's press secretary, Bruce Cuthbertson, said Monday that the congressman 
is willing to listen to appeals from Californians in Congress and thinks that 
perhaps the earthquake functions of the Geological Survey could be transferred 
to the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuthbertson said Kasich calculates that closing the agency would save $3.2 
billion in federal funds over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, whether the congressman really follows through with his idea is 
uncertain. "This is on the list of possible cuts to offset tax cuts," he said. 
"He's conservative, but he's also open to other suggestions, if his colleagues 
have any." 
</P>
<P>
 At the survey's headquarters in Reston, Va., agency Director Gordon Eaton 
emphasized in a statement that the agency's work touches every part of the 
nation and includes mapping, mitigating natural hazards and assessing mineral 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "The value of our work is recognized by more than 1,000 local, state and 
federal agencies who have joined us in scientific and technical partnership in 
all 50 states," Eaton said. "Moreover, our partners are providing more than 
$300 million in support." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's 1994-95 fiscal year budget is $571.5 million, of which $48.9 
million is set aside for earthquake monitoring and research. The Geological 
Survey has 9,314 employees, including 1,354 in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of its employees monitor water quality and quantity, but the survey is 
best known for its earthquake and volcano work. 
</P>
<P>
 Its employees give many briefings about California's important quakes and are 
a leading source of research papers and field trips. 
</P>
<P>
 They also issue weekly seismic reports to businesses, utilities and news 
agencies.

 An Israeli jailed since 1962 for refusing to agree to a divorce has died at 
81, keeping a vow to keep his estranged wife married to him until his last 
breath, the prison service said. Yihya Avraham, who married his wife Ora, 66, 
in Yemen when she was 12 years old, died Sunday, a week after suffering a 
cerebral hemorrhage.Avraham and his wife had been separated for 41 years. Over 
the years, Avraham was offered blessings from prominent rabbis, lodging in an 
expensive retirement home and his freedom if he would say just three words. 
Under Jewish law a husband may be held in prison until he complies with a 
rabbinical court's order to grant his wife a divorce. To be freed he must 
declare: "I am willing."

 Peace talks between Israel and Syria are going nowhere, and only a concerted 
diplomatic effort by the United States might salvage them, a senior Israeli 
official said Monday on the eve of Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
arrival here. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher is on his first swing through the Middle East since he accompanied 
President Clinton to the October signing of Israel's peace treaty with Jordan. 
He is due to stop in Damascus today before going on to Israel this evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pace of the negotiations (with Syria) is very slow, and even if there's 
occasional progress, such progress won't enable us to achieve peace in the 
remaining time, which may be several months to a year," Deputy Foreign Minister 
Yossi Beilin told Israel Radio. "Therefore a breakthrough, either procedural or 
substantial, is essential." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin's comments were made after Clinton telephoned Syrian President Hafez 
Assad and reported to Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres that nothing new 
had emerged from what was described as a lengthy conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, Israeli officials have been expressing frustration over Syria's 
refusal to enter into high-level negotiations. The Syrians broke off direct 
talks with Israel in February after a Jewish settler opened fire on Muslim 
worshipers in a mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron, killing about 30. The 
talks have never been revived. Instead, the Syrians have relied on U.S. 
mediation through Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli newspapers reported Monday that there is a dispute within Israeli 
intelligence circles over whether Syria remains strategically committed to 
making peace with Israel. The dispute is said to be so fierce that it is 
holding up the delivery of the 1995 intelligence review to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 In Syria on Monday, Assad appeared to signal that he is still interested in 
pursuing negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 His spokesman quoted the president as telling a private U.S. delegation that 
"Syria wants peace. The road to this peace is not constructed, but despite 
that, Syria has not lost hope." Assad met with members of the Washington 
Institute for Near East Policy, a pro-Israeli think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace could not be achieved on the ground if it was not just and 
comprehensive, even if all documents were signed," Joubran Kourieh, Assad's 
spokesman, quoted Assad as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years of on-again, off-again negotiations, Israel and Syria remain 
far apart on what they are prepared to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has publicly committed Israel to the 
return of an unspecified amount of the strategic Golan Heights in exchange for 
a peace treaty and full normalization of relations with Syria. In negotiations, 
Rabin has promised to withdraw to an unspecified borderline over a three-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad, however, is demanding a commitment to a full withdrawal from the 
heights -- which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War -- 
before entering into high-level negotiations on the terms of peace. He also 
wants the withdrawal to be completed within a year, with Jewish settlements -- 
housing about 12,000 Israelis -- dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin and other senior officials warn that the territorial concessions the 
government will have to make in exchange for peace with Syria will become 
politically impossible in another year, when Israel's next parliamentary 
campaign will get under way. Relinquishing even part of the Golan Heights is an 
explosive issue in Israel, because the northeastern plateau has long been 
considered vital to the nation's security. A hostile army atop the heights 
would be seen as posing a threat to the entire Galilee. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrived in 
Israel on Monday for a two-day visit with the defense Establishment, and 
military sources said the general will be exploring ways the United States can 
help ensure Israel's security if it withdraws from the Golan. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has already signaled a willingness to station 1,000 
peacekeeping troops on the heights as part of a multinational monitoring force 
should a peace treaty be signed. But Israel's defense Establishment believes 
that Israel also needs a deep withdrawal of Syrian forces and a reconfiguration 
of the Syrian army, together with early-warning stations atop the Golan, to be 
protected from the possibility of a surprise attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem facing the government as it contemplates the possibility that 
Assad might decide to opt out of negotiations is whether Israel can continue 
making progress toward establishing diplomatic ties with Arab states if it 
fails to make peace with Syria, the only Arab country that still poses a 
substantial military threat to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin's plea for greater U.S. involvement comes as Israeli officials are 
insisting that they can make no further gestures toward Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin evoked the memory of then-Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's 
shuttle diplomacy between Damascus and Jerusalem in 1974 and said a similar 
effort is needed now from the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, Beilin said, senior Israeli and Syrian officials should directly 
negotiate a peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alternative is greater U.S. involvement, not necessarily in the form of 
bridging proposals but in the form of continuous and more orderly visit 
diplomacy," Beilin said. "We can't dictate to the Americans whether to 
establish headquarters here or to come over once a week, but more American time 
devoted to the Israel-Syria subject may lead to a solution in a shorter period 
of time."

<P>
 At Syria's urging, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri agreed Monday to stay in power, 
defusing the worst political crisis in Lebanon since civil war ended four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision followed 2 1/2 hours of talks with President Hafez Assad of Syria 
and underscored his control over Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Political corruption scandals and Cabinet rifts pushed Hariri to resign 
Thursday. But aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday that he 
would return home to resume his duties.

SCIENCE; FATE OF INDIAN BURIAL RESEARCH HANGS BY A HAIR; DNA TESTING OF A 
SINGLE STRAND IS HALTED AFTER NATIVE AMERICANS CLAIM IT FALLS UNDER ACT THAT 
PROTECTS HUMAN REMAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An archeological breakthrough that could help answer some of the oldest and 
most perplexing questions about human history has been stopped dead in its 
tracks by a strict interpretation of recent legislation designed to protect the 
sanctity of ancient burial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 And archeologist Robson Bonnichsen of Oregon State University believes the 
issue could eventually shut down many excavation sites in North America and 
threaten scores of other federally funded projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnichsen is on the cutting edge of a technology that could answer such basic 
questions as where the first inhabitants of North America came from and how 
they migrated across this continent and into South America. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to solving this mystery, which has bedeviled scientists, has been 
around for thousands of years and was literally right under the feet of 
archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 It is human hair, preserved in the mud and clay into which it was shed. And 
until Bonnichsen recently began subjecting ancient hair samples to DNA 
analysis, no one realized its importance. DNA, which carries the genetic 
blueprint for every living organism, could offer scientists the best 
opportunity they have ever had to trace human history back through time. 
</P>
<P>
 A single hair could contain enough DNA to reveal the ethnic origin -- and thus 
the cultural history -- of someone who crossed the Bering land bridge from 
Siberia to North America more than 12,000 years ago as part of the first 
settling of the Americas, Bonnichsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why archeologists around the world were electrified earlier this year 
by Bonnichsen's announcement that he and his colleagues had managed to extract 
DNA from an ancient human hair found in a site in southwestern Montana. 
Although his work is in its embryonic stage, the announcement was heralded as a 
breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as he cradled a single strand of human hair in surgically gloved 
hands at his laboratory here recently, he told of a chain of events that has -- 
at least for now -- curtailed his research. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Bureau of Land Management, which controls the desolate region near 
Dillon, Mont., where Bonnichsen has been excavating, has rescinded his permit 
to work at the site and ordered him to return the human hair for burial by 
Native Americans who inhabit the area. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 
1990, a federal law designed to protect the privacy and sanctity of burial 
grounds. Two Montana tribes, the Kootenai-Salish and the Shoshone-Bannock, 
appealed to the bureau on the grounds that human hair is covered by the act, 
and thus subject to protection and repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnichsen, who is director of the university's Center for Study of the First 
Americans, scoffs at that contention -- claiming that human hair is shed 
naturally throughout a person's lifetime and that the law was not intended to 
include naturally shed human products. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think that human hair that was naturally shed in life has anything 
to do with this act," he said. He and attorney Alan L. Schneider of Eugene, 
Ore., have petitioned the federal government to make sure that regulations now 
being developed reflect that. 
</P>
<P>
 Top federal officials seem to agree with that position, including Francis P. 
McManamon, chief archeologist for the National Park Service who is directing 
the formulation of the new regulations. McManamon said hair that is not found 
in association with human remains and was apparently shed during life should 
not be included under the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana's Native Americans strongly disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the law, if it (hair) is found in an archeological complex, it is a 
human remain," said Karen Atkinson, attorney for the Kootenai-Salish tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson said her people asked the BLM to rescind Bonnichsen's permit earlier 
this year after they discovered that he had been excavating the area for nine 
years. Under federal law, she said, the bureau is required to consult with 
Native Americans in the area before granting a permit, and that had not been 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of human hair in the site, she added, further strengthens the 
tribes' position. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Gary Smith, the Bureau of Land Management's archeologist in 
Montana, is left in the hot seat, trying to mediate. Smith is the man who shut 
down Bonnichsen's site, although he says the archeologist's failure to complete 
some required reports and the tribes' overall objections to the excavation also 
figured into that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed only with proposed regulations published in the Federal Register on May 
28, 1993, Smith said he had no choice but to agree with the Native Americans. 
Those regulations define human remains as "including but not limited to bones, 
teeth, hair, ashes or mummified or otherwise preserved soft tissues of a person 
of Native American ancestry." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnichsen and his center have asked that final regulations exclude "naturally 
shed" human hair, but Atkinson said that would not resolve the conflict. The 
law specifies that human remains are protected, and she maintains that human 
hair is clearly a human remain. Any attempt to change that in the regulations 
could lead to a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bonnichsen, the quandary goes far beyond the importance of his single 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hair is the artifact that human beings produce the most of," he said. It 
apparently is easily preserved by nature, so it is probably present in many if 
not most archeological sites. If it is classified as a human remain, all sites 
with hair in them, in effect, would be considered burial sites, curtailing 
archeological research, Bonnichsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact could also extend to other projects, he added. If a soil engineer 
finds a hair in his sample, "he's got a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnichsen said he was just starting to make headway when his project was 
halted. Much remains to be understood about how much the presence of human hair 
can tell us, but he is convinced his work will enrich the understanding of 
human history. 
</P>
<P>
 It came about almost by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnichsen was working at his Montana site in 1986 when one of his colleagues 
picked up a rock and noticed what appeared to be a hair on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The short strand appeared ancient, Bonnichsen said. It was sent off to 
Pennsylvania State University, where molecular biologists subjected it to DNA 
analysis. It was, in fact, a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that particular sample had been contaminated by the man who picked it 
up, the results convinced Bonnichsen that he had come across a valuable tool. 
</P>
<P>
 He teamed up with Marvin Beatty, dean of the college of agriculture at the 
University of Wisconsin, to take the project a step further. Beatty developed a 
technique for separating hair from soil by immersing the soil in water and 
floating the hair to the surface. The solution is passed through a fine screen 
that traps the hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we started a major flotation operation," Bonnichsen said. The results were 
startling. Almost every bucket of soil produced at least one hair. 
</P>
<P>
 It may tell a great story, he said, by allowing scientists to trace the 
genetic history of a single group of early Americans, or even answer health and 
nutrition questions about those who passed by so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It also holds the promise of enhancing the reliability of dates for 
archeological sites. The age of hair can be determined relatively precisely by 
examining it in a particle accelerator, which determines the ratio of carbon 
isotopes that decay at known rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Erwin Taylor, chairman of the department of anthropology at UC Riverside, used 
his university's accelerator to date hair from a New Mexico site at 12,000 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 It requires several hairs to make a sample large enough to carry out the 
dating, thus increasing the chances of error, but Taylor said he and his 
colleagues have made so much progress in recent weeks that that could soon 
change. Dating of "a single strand of hair is not too far off," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnichsen believes the new technique will be particularly helpful in 
determining which early Americans inhabited which sites, where they came from 
and how they migrated across the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 But now he fears he may never get the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing could kill it," he said. "The whole effort could be snuffed out." 
Excavation Site 
</P>
<P>
 DNA taken from a human hair excavated at a site near Dillon, in desolate 
southwestern Montana, could provide a genetic history lesson on the region. But 
federal authorities revoked the permit allowing work on the site, based on laws 
protecting Native American burial grounds.

HEMISPHERE SUMMIT TO SET GOAL OF A FREE-TRADE ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG and DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton and the leaders of 33 other Western Hemisphere nations will 
set a goal of creating a free-trade zone joining the United States, Canada and 
all of Latin America when they meet this weekend in Miami in the first 
hemisphere-wide summit conference in a generation, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials said that the most difficult issue to resolve 
in establishing the goal is a target date. They indicated that the 34 leaders 
will aim for a 10-year negotiating plan under which an accord would be in place 
by 2005 that would eliminate all tariffs and other barriers to trade within the 
hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit agreement is also expected to pledge tougher adherence to standards 
protecting workers' rights and the environment, two sensitive issues that 
almost derailed the precedent-setting North American Free Trade Agreement last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, known as the Summit of the Americas, will delve into such 
still-touchy issues as corruption, drugs, terrorism and human rights. Its 
heart, however, will be the dramatic expansion of economic activity among the 
nations of North, Central and South America as Clinton tries to push 
international trade into the forefront of the hemisphere's relations. The 
free-trade zone would encompass every nation in the hemisphere except Fidel 
Castro's Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 A draft of the declaration, which calls for a new "Americas Free Trade Area," 
has circulated in Washington since a final pre-summit meeting Friday among 
senior aides to hemisphere presidents and prime ministers. A final declaration 
is scheduled to be made public Sunday at the conclusion of the three-day 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Clinton is expected to take the first step toward reaching the 
free-trade goal by announcing the immediate start of talks to bring Chile into 
NAFTA, to which the United States, Mexico and Canada now belong. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile is "ready for a free-trade agreement with the President of the United 
States. President Clinton is committed to (achieving) that -- and watch what 
happens in Miami," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in a speech Monday at 
the National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting a specific target date for removing all barriers to trade is 
considered of particular importance because it would move participants beyond 
rhetoric and toward a tangible goal intended to boost commercial opportunities 
in the second-fastest-growing region of the world, after Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that a final agreement among the 34 nations has not been 
reached. "We expect that to happen," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By setting a specific target for achieving a free-trade accord and linking it 
to substantive goals, officials hope to add a measure of concrete progress to 
what otherwise is likely to turn into a largely ceremonial gathering 
highlighting the hemisphere's economic growth, democracy and free-market 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit is the first such gathering of all the leaders of the region, with 
the exception of Castro, since a conference in Uruguay in 1967. It is intended 
to go beyond the limited achievements of that meeting, held when most Latin 
American countries deliberately limited trade and when U.S. policy was focused 
on foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Several groups of nations already have taken steps to remove tariffs and other 
barriers to commerce, such as quotas. The goal is to see their economies grow 
because of greater cross-border sales and to achieve improved standards of 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft declaration's handling of the issue of workers' rights and the 
environment was a diplomatic success for the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States pressed for specific treatment of the issues. One senior 
Administration official said the issues would be accorded "a separate 
paragraph" in the final declaration.

ZEDILLO FACES SHOWDOWN OVER CHIAPAS GOVERNORSHIP; MEXICO: REBELS VOW A PARALLEL 
GOVERNMENT IF RULING PARTY CANDIDATE IS INAUGURATED AFTER DISPUTED ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Ernesto Zedillo is headed for the first showdown of his new 
government this week, with eleventh-hour negotiations over Chiapas ending in a 
tentative agreement likely to leave Mexico's embattled southernmost state with 
two governors and parallel governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed rebels warned that the scheduled ruling-party gubernatorial inauguration 
in Chiapas on Thursday could trigger a blood bath. In a move to ease tensions, 
Gov.-elect Eduardo Robledo Rincon offered to take a six-year leave of absence 
from the party to prove he wants to "govern for all the people of Chiapas." 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of weekend talks with new Interior Secretary Esteban Moctezuma 
Barragan in Mexico City, the two rivals for power in the impoverished state 
vowed to avoid a violent confrontation when Robledo officially takes office. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the meetings as "encouraging," Moctezuma said Robledo and his 
rival, Chiapas opposition leader Amado Avendano, agreed to a six-point accord 
that should guarantee a peaceful transition of power on inauguration day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Avendano, who claims to be the real winner of the Aug. 21 election, 
announced as he returned to the state that despite his promise to respect 
Robledo's inauguration, he will create a "parallel government" this week. He 
also said his supporters will go ahead with plans for massive protests 
Wednesday and Thursday, which Robledo agreed to tolerate. Avendano's opposition 
Democratic Revolutionary Party insists that Robledo and the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party stole the election by fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the implications of two governments in a state many analysts say 
is on the brink of another insurrection, Avendano told reporters, "Use your 
imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 The post-election conflict in the state, which was the scene of an armed 
peasant and Indian rebellion that left more than 145 people dead during the 
first 12 days of January, is seen as a key test of Zedillo's promise to foster 
a new era of political pluralism, reform and government through dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a test of his new government's ability to keep order in the nation, 
where similar post-election conflicts are simmering in the states of Tabasco 
and Jalisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army has threatened to abandon its 
jungle and mountain bases in Chiapas and launch a nationwide civil war if 
Robledo is sworn in Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wishes to avoid a blood bath in these parts, it would be better that he 
resign this post, which he did not obtain by the will of the people," rebel 
leader Subcommander Marcos declared in a communique issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat came even as Zedillo's government announced the accord allowing the 
governor's inauguration to take place. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nationally televised speech Monday night, Zedillo did not mention 
Chiapas. Instead, he unveiled the first in a series of measures to reform the 
judiciary and create a new rule of law in a nation where official corruption is 
endemic in the police and the courts. He said he will propose the reforms to 
the nation's Congress as constitutional amendments this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo, elected in August and inaugurated last week, plans to take his most 
dramatic and concrete step today toward pluralism and reform of Mexico's 65 
years of continuous one-party national rule when he meets behind closed doors 
with 500 members of the national legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The luncheon meeting marks the first time in Mexican history that a president 
will consult formally with the nation's elected Congress on matters of national 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the historic congressional session, the ruling PRI also tried to 
send strong signals that it would embark on a new era of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria de los Angeles Moreno, who was elected the party's first female 
president over the weekend, declared that the party must reform or crumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either the party changes in response to the aspirations of its members for 
renewal," she said in her inauguration speech, "or it becomes paralyzed under 
its own weight, in danger of obsolescence." 
</P>
<P>
 But Moreno did not specify what changes she plans, and at a time when the PRI 
is torn from within as never before between hard-liners and reformers, her 
pledges of renewal were met with less than enthusiasm from the opposition.

MOSCOW SEALS BORDER WITH BREAKAWAY REPUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia sealed the border of the breakaway republic of Chechnya on Monday, and 
both the Chechen government and opposition leaders expressed fears of imminent 
Russian intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 In neighboring North Ossetia, Russian Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev 
admitted that Russian warplanes attacked Chechen airfields last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev told the Itar-Tass news agency that planes that brought weapons and 
mercenaries to Chechnya were parked at the airfields. 
</P>
<P>
 He said only facilities controlled by Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev were 
targeted. "It was these facilities that were destroyed," Grachev said. He 
denied reports that residential areas were fired on. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more of a threat of war, not less," Chechen Foreign Minister Yousef 
Shamsedin told reporters in the Chechen capital of Grozny, pointing to 
Grachev's presence in North Ossetia as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Shamsedin estimated that Russia will attack in two or three days if no 
settlement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev, who declared Chechnya independent in 1991, has for months been 
accusing Moscow of arming and leading rebels seeking to oust him from power. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Interfax news agency, Grachev said three Russian army groups 
were being mobilized on Chechnya's border, including army units, Interior 
Ministry troops and "special forces" for possible military action.

NEWS ANALYSIS; BRITAIN, FRANCE AGONIZE OVER BOSNIA ROLE; BALKANS: AS U.N. FORCE 
LEADERS, THEY FACE DANGERS WHETHER THEY STAY OR GO. DECISION COULD COME TODAY.

<P>
 Britain and France, which contribute the most troops to the U.N. Protection 
Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, may decide as early as today whether to soldier on 
with the perilous mission or attempt a dangerous withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
have been hand-wringing and huddling with mission commanders, Balkan 
powerbrokers and Western allies for the past several days as Bosnian Serb 
gunmen have harassed and threatened the lives of their troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The European diplomats face a Hobson's choice of acknowledging failure and 
pulling out of the collapsing mission or trying to muddle through a few more 
weeks or months of frustrating operations in the midst of heavily armed rebels 
who have made it clear they want the peacekeepers to retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 With 350 U.N. troops still held hostage as insurance against bombings by North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization warplanes and Serbian nationalist attacks on U.N. 
"safe areas" intensifying, U.N. officials have begun to concede that the 
decision on a pullout is less a question of "if" than "when." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the threat of NATO air strikes has been all but removed, 
international mediators have no leverage left to pressure the defiant rebels to 
agree to a formula for peace proposed by the five-nation Contact Group. 
</P>
<P>
 And having failed to enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at 
protecting Bosnian civilians or to let NATO destroy rebel missile batteries 
that have grounded relief planes, the international community has no credible 
assurances of security to offer the Muslim-led Bosnian government in urging it 
to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the U.N. mission in a no-win situation, with no prospects for a 
peaceful settlement and both sides retrenching for another round of violence 
that will continue to escalate the risks for the 24,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials and Western diplomats here say that the chances of an official, 
coordinated pullout are slim in view of the stormy debate likely to precede a 
formal Security Council vote to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely scenario, they fear, is a piecemeal pullout in which 
individual countries frustrated by the repeated diplomatic failures to broker 
peace will succumb to domestic pressures to get their troops out of harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven kidnaped Ukrainian peacekeepers were released by the Bosnian Serbs on 
Monday, but 350 U.N. troops remain captive, among them a Jordanian military 
observer with a life-threatening heart ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels in the nationalist stronghold of Banja Luka are refusing to release the 
ill officer for urgent treatment unless the mission sends another hostage to 
take his place. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials have routinely condemned Serbian harassment of peacekeepers, 
but neither words nor threats have chastened the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bangladeshi soldier trapped in the besieged Bihac pocket died Saturday after 
being deprived of medical aid by a Croatian Serb blockade, and information on 
the case is being forwarded to the International War Crimes Tribunal in The 
Hague, mission spokesman Paul Risley said. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, also expressed mounting 
frustration and an unusual degree of impatience with the dominant rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs "deserve nothing but contempt" for thwarting humanitarian aid 
convoys bound for their victims, spokesman Thant Myint-U said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurd and Juppe made a last-ditch visit to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade on 
Sunday to sound out the prospects of getting Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic to push his Bosnian Serb proxies to sign the Contact Group peace plan 
if it were amended to allow eventual creation of a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has lately indicated that the option 
of uniting with Serbia is too little, too late. He now insists on more 
territory than the 49% the plan would give him, as well as international 
recognition of his conquered territory as a separate state. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. and diplomatic sources here say the foreign ministers left Belgrade with 
little encouragement that Karadzic would be lured by an amended plan. 
</P>
<P>
 British Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind flew to the Croatian port of Split 
on Monday to consult with the commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, British Lt. 
Gen. Michael Rose, to hear his views on the quandary over whether to leave or 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkind warned after their talks that British troops would pull out of Bosnia 
if they encounter further harassment. But Rose told reporters that his country 
and other U.N. members have "a moral duty" to see Bosnian civilians through the 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkind is expected at the U.N. mission headquarters here today for 
consultations with the top civilian and military officials, after which Britain 
is expected to decide its future in the peacekeeping mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Rifkind had told Rose they were pulling out, Rose would not have said what 
he said," one U.N. official observed, adding that it seemed unlikely Britain 
would opt for an immediate withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 French troops are mostly deployed in Sarajevo, where they would be vulnerable 
to both Serbian harassment and Bosnian civilian efforts to prevent a retreat 
that would probably leave the city overrun by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the first snows of winter already hampering road movements, observers 
here predicted that it would be more likely for the French to ride out the 
mission until spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the desire to persevere with humanitarian tasks such as escorting aid 
to hungry and isolated Muslim communities, pressures are building steadily for 
a withdrawal next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The next session of the U.S. Congress, which begins in early January, will be 
dominated by Republicans vowing to lift a U.N. arms embargo hampering Bosnian 
government defenses. Leading GOP politicians such as incoming Senate Majority 
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia have also 
begun clamoring for NATO action to destroy the Serbs' artillery and weapons 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 As Serbian rebel fears of a comeuppance rise with the threat of a military 
turnaround, their determination to strike government holdouts while they have 
the upper hand will progressively step up the risks for the peacekeepers 
deployed around vulnerable Muslim enclaves.

U.S. GESTURES LEAVE TAIWAN HUNGRY FOR RECOGNITION; ASIA: ADMINISTRATION TRIES 
TO SHOW IT CARES WITHOUT UNDERMINING AMERICAN RELATIONS WITH BEIJING.

 Taiwan wants respect. President Clinton sent Transportation Secretary Federico 
Pena on an "unofficial" visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui, instigator of major democratic reforms on 
the island, wants recognition and a seat in the United Nations. Pena, who 
arrived in Taipei on Monday, read him a letter from Clinton addressed to 
another man. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the diplomatic ballet being danced in Taipei these days as the U.S. 
government tries to show Taiwan its love without violating its 15-year-old 
policy agreement with mainland China stating that Taiwan does not exist as an 
independent state. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Taiwan is one of its biggest trading partners, the Communist 
government officially still considers the island a province of the mainland 
under the control of "bandits." In 1979, the United States recognized the "one 
China" policy and severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan in order to 
normalize relations with the much larger and more populous People's Republic of 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the U.S. policy say it is difficult to find another country in the 
world more deserving of U.S. favor than Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without formal recognition, Taiwan is one of Washington's staunchest 
political allies. It is the sixth-biggest importer of U.S. goods, ahead of 
France in that respect. Almost all of its senior leadership, including Lee, 
hold advanced degrees from U.S. universities. 
</P>
<P>
 More impressively, over the past six years Taiwan has converted itself from a 
one-party, martial-law regime into one of Asia's most vibrant democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, in a move that infuriated the mainland Chinese regime, 
then-President George Bush took the first step toward acknowledging Taiwan's 
progress, sending then-U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to Taipei for a 
Taiwanese-U.S. business conference. 
</P>
<P>
 After a policy review in September, Clinton vowed to raise the level of U.S. 
contact with Taiwan another notch. Clinton, who visited Taiwan four times as 
governor of Arkansas, praised in writing Taiwan's "remarkable economic 
development and democratic evolution." 
</P>
<P>
 This week he dispatched Pena and several Treasury officials to attend the same 
business meeting attended by Hills two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Also attending the business conference were Bush and Sen. Frank H. Murkowski 
(R-Alaska). Murkowski, one of the Senate's strongest advocates of diplomatic 
recognition of Taiwan, accompanied a 29-person delegation from Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement at the airport, Pena pleased the Taiwanese officials by 
pledging U.S. support for Taiwan's candidacy for the World Trade Organization, 
successor to GATT, or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But Pena 
stressed that his visit to Taiwan is "unofficial." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he will meet privately with President Lee today, his public 
communication with the Taiwanese leader Monday was limited to reading a letter 
from Clinton to former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, co-chairman of 
the R.O.C. (Republic of China on Taiwan)-U.S.A. Economic Council that sponsored 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Cap," Clinton's letter began, continuing to explain that "Secretary 
Pena's presence at this meeting is ample testament to the interest of this 
Administration in improving economic relations between the United States and 
Taiwan." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Lee did nothing to hide his disappointment, calling the Clinton 
policy review a "miniature shift." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rarely can we find another country in the world that is comparable to the 
Republic of China's (Taiwan's) outstanding scores both in democratic system and 
in market economy," Lee said in a speech Monday while Pena listened only a few 
feet away. "Therefore, a reasonable recognition from the U.S. of our positive 
roles in the Asia Pacific region and in the world should be a matter of course 
for a fair status and just treatment that we so much deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's editions of Taiwanese newspapers all featured front-page photographs 
of Pena reading the "Dear Cap" letter as Lee looked on sternly. In what was 
described by the Taiwanese press as another "first," Pena also met with 
Taiwanese Foreign Minister Fredrick Chien and Vincent Siew, the chief of the 
Council of Economic Planning and Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously uncomfortable with the contradictions of U.S. policy related to 
Taiwan, Bush effusively praised Lee at a dinner Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I salute Taiwan for making great strides in its inexorable march toward 
democracy," Bush said, expressing sympathy to the Taiwanese leaders for "the 
difficult position you find yourselves in" -- alluding to the lack of official 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of nations, including several African countries that have 
benefited from Taiwan's generous foreign aid, formally recognize Taiwan. Few 
countries are willing to take this step because it means immediate loss of 
diplomatic recognition by China. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he was asked by a businessman at the dinner when Taiwan could expect 
to be given a seat in the United Nations, Bush could only say: 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't help you. I'm not clairvoyant enough to know when it will 
happen."

PUBLIC IS URGED TO TREAT OBESITY AS CHRONIC DISEASE; HEALTH: MEDICAL PANEL 
CALLS FOR LONG-TERM WEIGHT MANAGEMENT RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON LOSS ALONE. 
SURGERY, DRUGS SHOULD ALSO BE OPTIONS, REPORT FINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Institute of Medicine called Monday for a fundamental change in public 
thinking about obesity, saying that the condition should be regarded not as a 
cosmetic problem but as "an important, chronic, degenerative disease that 
debilitates individuals and kills prematurely." 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment should be aimed toward long-term weight management, rather than 
weight loss alone -- with the goal of achieving and maintaining the appropriate 
weight for a person's overall health instead of for appearance only, the 
institute said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-obesity medications and surgery, for example, "deserve a new look as 
potentially powerful and effective weight-management treatments, if used 
properly, for some people," specifically those who have failed with other 
approaches, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel urged health professionals to consider changing the way anti-obesity 
drugs are administered -- typically they are limited to several months' use -- 
so that such medications "are treated similarly to those used for the treatment 
of other medical problems, such as hypertension." 
</P>
<P>
 The institute, part of the National Academy of Sciences, is a private, 
nonprofit organization chartered by Congress that advises the federal 
government on health policy. While its recommendations are not binding, they 
typically wield considerable influence among decision-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations are likely to take on added importance in light of a 
movement to promote more tolerance toward those who are overweight and an 
increasing body of scientific evidence indicating that obesity could have 
metabolic and genetic underpinnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in fact, researchers announced that they have identified and cloned 
a gene responsible for obesity. The gene is responsible for secreting certain 
proteins, or "satiety factors," which signal the brain that the stomach is 
full, thus telling it to "stop eating," the researchers said. Researchers 
believe that, when this gene is damaged or defective, the signal is not sent or 
received and obesity may result. 
</P>
<P>
 Obese people often suffer discrimination, said the report, compiled by a panel 
of outside experts on internal medicine, diet and nutrition and psychology. 
"Perhaps most lay persons, health care providers and even obese individuals 
themselves do not perceive the metabolic nature of the disease and thus view 
obesity as a problem of willful misconduct -- eating too much and exercising 
too little," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The term obesity refers to excess body fat, while the term overweight usually 
refers to an excess amount of total body weight -- including all tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 Men with more than 25% body fat and women with more than 30% are considered 
obese. 
</P>
<P>
 One of every three American adults and one of every four teen-agers and 
children are obese, according to the panel. The condition has been associated 
with numerous medical ailments, including cardiovascular disease and 
hypertension, certain cancers, such as breast and colon cancer and other 
chronic ailments at an annual health care cost of more than $70 billion a year, 
the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, obese individuals need not reach a rigid appropriate weight to 
improve their health, the panel said. "Scientific evidence suggests strongly 
that dropping even small amounts of weight -- 10% to 15% of initial body weight 
-- can reduce the risk of premature illness and death," the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, former Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop launched a new campaign timed 
to coincide with the document on obesity, urging Americans to "eat sensibly, 
exercise regularly, drop a few pounds (and) shape up." 
</P>
<P>
 Koop, backed by medical organizations, several food and other major 
corporations, said that his effort is designed to convince Americans of the 
benefits of even modest weight losses. He is to be joined today by First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton to kick off the new campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 After smoking, "obesity-related conditions are the second leading cause of 
death in the United States, resulting in about 300,000 lives lost each year," 
Koop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans spend more than $33 billion annually on weight-loss programs and 
diet aids, such as drinks and foods, a figure that does not factor in "human 
costs," such as lowered self-esteem and clinical depression, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an epidemic of obesity in this country among both adults and 
children," said Judith S. Stern, professor in the nutrition and internal 
medicine departments at UC Davis, who chaired the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tens of millions of people are dieting at any one time, spending billions on 
weight-loss programs, yet few reduce their body fat to a healthy level, and 
even fewer maintain the weight lost beyond two or three years," Stern added. 
"They need tools for making better decisions about how to lose weight. And all 
weight-loss programs should be encouraged to better serve the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel urged the diet industry to engage in full disclosure when dealing 
with consumers, including releasing information about how well their programs 
work, approaches and goals. The committee also advised the public to judge the 
programs based on their success in achieving long-term weight loss, which is 
defined as maintaining at least a 5% reduction in body weight for a year or 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said that drugs and surgery, when used, should be combined with a 
program of diet, physical activity and behavior modification. 
</P>
<P>
 Panelists also said that gastric surgery that makes the stomach smaller helps 
reduce health problems in severely obese patients who have failed with 
non-surgical measures.

LITTLE ROCK APPRAISER PLEADS GUILTY IN WHITEWATER PROBE; SCANDAL: HE ADMITS 
FALSIFYING LOAN EVALUATIONS FOR REAL ESTATE PROJECTS BY FRIENDS OF MCDOUGAL, 
CLINTON'S PARTNER IN THE OZARKS RESORT DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Little Rock land appraiser pleaded guilty Monday to creating phony 
evaluations of real estate projects involved in the Whitewater investigation 
and agreed to provide evidence to independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. Palmer, 44, entered his plea before a federal judge as part of an 
agreement with Starr, who has been investigating President Clinton's investment 
in the Ozarks resort development known as Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer's plea is expected to be followed today by the announcement of another 
plea agreement between Starr and former Associate Atty. Gen. Webster L. 
Hubbell, a close friend of the President and former law partner to First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely that Palmer can provide Starr with any direct evidence to 
support the central allegation in the Whitewater case that money from the 
now-defunct Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan was diverted illegally into 
Clinton's Whitewater real estate investment or his gubernatorial campaign fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, because Palmer was responsible for drafting false appraisals for 
loans to real estate projects by friends of Madison owner James B. McDougal, he 
is likely to provide insight into a wide range of financial transactions -- 
perhaps including some aspects of the joint Clinton-McDougal investment in 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 He also could shed some light on a contention by the government's star 
witness, David Hale, that he was pressured by McDougal and Clinton to make an 
improper $300,000 government-backed loan to McDougal's wife, Susan. More than 
$100,000 of that money passed through the Whitewater accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has denied that he pressured Hale to make the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the document that Palmer signed in court, he admitted that in February, 
1986, he falsified and backdated at least 25 appraisals of Madison-financed 
real estate projects in a vain effort by the thrift management to avoid being 
seized by the government for insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, he said, he submitted a bill for $15,350 to Madison on which 
he intentionally misrepresented his charges as "a real estate consultant fee" 
for what he described as a "market feasibility and economic analysis." 
</P>
<P>
 The plea agreement made no mention of numerous other appraisals that Palmer 
did for Madison, or of the $61,000 loan he received from the thrift. In doing 
his appraisals, according to the government, Palmer never disclosed his 
financial interest in the institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer's offer to cooperate with Starr was seen as a setback for Clinton's 
successor as governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker, who is also a subject of 
Starr's investigation. Among the many projects that Palmer appraised was the 
Castle Water and Sewer property in which Tucker invested. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Palmer did the appraisal of property owned by Hale, a former 
municipal judge who also ran a federally backed small business investment 
corporation. By exaggerating the value of the property, Palmer enabled Hale to 
raise the capital needed to fund the controversial $300,000 loan to Susan 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge to which Palmer pleaded guilty carries a maximum sentence of five 
years in jail and a maximum fine of $250,000. No date has yet been set for his 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for his cooperation, Starr pledged that Palmer would not be 
prosecuted for any other potential crimes related to the work he did for 
Madison. Presumably, Starr would also recommend a reduced sentence if Palmer 
cooperates fully with the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued by his lawyer, Palmer said he decided to cooperate with 
the independent counsel "as a matter of conscience" for conduct that did not 
adhere to the standards of his profession. He said he acted improperly 
primarily out of friendship, not out of a desire to profit financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Had President Clinton's financial affairs not come under the scrutiny of a 
special investigator, Palmer might never have been called to account for his 
actions. As he noted in his statement: 
</P>
<P>
 "The election from this state of a President of the United States has led to 
intense national scrutiny of business transactions which are now almost a 
decade old, and I must now account for my own carelessness from that era." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer's plea marked Starr's first appearance in court since he succeeded 
Robert B. Fiske Jr. last summer as independent counsel in the Whitewater case. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell is expected to plead guilty to overbilling the government for work he 
did as a lawyer to help resolve the Madison accounts after it was closed in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not yet known what information Hubbell may supply to the independent 
counsel as part of any plea agreement.

DEMOCRATIC GROUP UNVEILS ALTERNATIVE TO GOP 'CONTRACT'; POLITICS: CENTRIST 
LEADERSHIP COUNCIL'S PLAN SEEKS TO RETOOL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. PARTY IS URGED 
TO CALL FOR MORE SWEEPING CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bid to provide direction to a Democratic Party and White House still 
dazed by their historic losses in the midterm congressional elections, the 
centrist Democratic Leadership Council on Monday released a 10-point 
"progressive alternative" to the Republican "contract with America." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which focuses heavily on retooling such government programs as 
welfare, job training and public housing, implicitly acknowledges that the GOP 
has seized the mantle of reform from a Clinton Administration that came into 
office promising to reinvent government. 
</P>
<P>
 To regain the initiative, the group argued, the Clinton Administration must 
propose more sweeping -- and politically risky -- changes in existing federal 
programs than it has been willing to embrace so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these elements are things we should have done in the first two years 
but the rest are what we should do in the next two years," said Will Marshall, 
president of the Progressive Policy Institute, the DLC's think tank in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the DLC has close ties to the Administration -- President Clinton 
chaired the organization before launching his presidential bid -- it is 
uncertain how far the group can push these ideas as a Democratic alternative to 
Republican plans in the coming Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem is that the election decimated the ranks of the moderate Southern 
and border state Democratic congressmen most sympathetic to the DLC message. 
Another potential obstacle is uncertainty from the White House about whether to 
push the kind of ambitious alternatives to the GOP contract included in the DLC 
document. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, some high-ranking officials said that the Administration is 
still considering an attack on corporate subsidies as the DLC proposes, but 
when Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich recently floated the idea, other senior 
officials, including White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, quickly shot 
it down. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Marshall and DLC President Al From contended that a 
bipartisan centrist coalition could pass some of these ideas over the next two 
years, particularly welfare reform. But they acknowledged they face a long-term 
grass-roots organizing process to build support for new approaches in the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our constituency is not in Congress or in Washington," From said. "If we 
depend on members of Congress to reform the Democratic Party, we'll sit here at 
a funeral." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two years, the DLC -- which was founded after Ronald Reagan's 
landslide reelection in 1984 to push the Democratic Party toward a more 
centrist course -- has seen several of its top priorities enacted into law, 
including a national service plan, a reinventing government initiative and an 
expansion of the earned income tax credit for the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has also piled up its share of grievances with the Administration, 
loudly dissenting from the Clinton health care plan and protesting the decision 
to delay welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative contract repackages ideas that the DLC has pushed over the 
last two years but also adds proposals. It echoes several themes prominent in 
the GOP plan, particularly deficit reduction and the shift of power away from 
Washington toward local government. 
</P>
<P>
 But the alternative departs from the GOP plan in supporting substantial new 
public spending on education, training, welfare reform and other social needs, 
and opposing tax cuts that could disproportionately benefit the affluent. 
</P>
<P>
 The main components of the DLC plan include: 
</P>
<P>
 Budget reform: In an approach it terms "cut and invest" economics, the DLC 
proposes eliminating $225 billion in spending and tax subsidies to private 
industry over the next five years and using the funds to expand public 
investments in national service, Head Start and infrastructure improvements. 
The group urged reducing the deficit and providing a middle-class tax cut by 
doubling the current children's exemption for families earning $50,000 or less 
annually. In addition, the group called for further deficit reduction by 
means-testing federal entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security -- 
for instance by providing smaller cost-of-living adjustments for affluent 
retirees -- and gradually raising to 70 the retirement age for Social Security 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Reforming social programs: The DLC plan attempts to find a path between the 
Republican calls for retrenchment -- which the group labels "punitive" -- and 
the traditional Democratic preference for large central bureaucracies, like the 
complex structure built around Clinton's doomed health care initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In welfare reform, the group generally endorses the Administration's 
blueprint, but calls for greater reliance on private contractors to place 
recipients in full-time jobs. It proposes a national campaign against teen-age 
pregnancy centered on a shift from "federal to community-based solutions," 
including group homes where teen-age mothers could be required to live with 
their children as a condition of government aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign affairs: Subtly dissenting from Clinton's push to establish free-trade 
zones across Asia and South America, the group instead calls for expanding the 
North American Free Trade Agreement through negotiations with individual 
nations willing to meet its standards for investment, open markets, labor 
standards and environmental protection.

SABOTEUR OF LEVEE BENT ON LOVE AFFAIRS RECEIVES LIFE TERM

<P>
 A man prosecutors said sabotaged a levee during the 1993 Midwest floods to 
strand his wife so he could have affairs was sentenced Monday to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 James R. Scott, 24, of Fowler, Ill., was convicted in November on charges of 
causing a catastrophe.He admitted to police that he removed sandbags from the 
levee, opening a breach that allowed the swollen Mississippi River to flood 
14,000 acres of farmland and destroy scores of buildings in West Quincy. 
</P>
<P>
 The breach also shut for 71 days a bridge that was the only link between 
Missouri and Illinois for 200 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Scott, an arsonist and burglar, told a friend that he wanted 
to make sure his wife couldn't return home across the river from her Missouri 
job, so that he could have affairs and party.

O.C. FINANCIAL CRISIS; BROKER HAS REPUTATION AS RISK-FRIENDLY; ADVICE: SOME 
OFFICIALS SAY MAN WHO HANDLED CITRON BOND BUSINESS TAKES TOO AGGRESSIVE A 
STANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A key adviser for Orange County's multibillion-dollar investment portfolio is 
a veteran San Francisco-based broker with a reputation as an aggressive trader 
-- sometimes too aggressive for his municipal clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Broker Michael Stamenson of Merrill Lynch & Co. has repeatedly declined 
requests for an interview after Orange County announced last Thursday that its 
bond portfolio had dropped $1.5 billion in value, to $18.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stamenson has handled some of the most complex trades for the pool, the 
derivatives and structured securities blamed for the loss. Merrill Lynch has 
extended Orange County $2.5 billion in credit to purchase securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamenson, 54, is generally described as an energetic salesman, but one who 
sometimes shows a comfort with risk that is ill-matched to the needs of a 
conservative public agency. 
</P>
<P>
 John deRussy, finance director for San Mateo, said his city has declined to do 
business with Stamenson because of his aggressive trading practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We chose not to do business with him because there was an inability to 
communicate between the two of us," deRussy said of an earlier overture by the 
broker. "Our investment goals were more conservative" than Stamenson would have 
pursued, deRussy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamenson has worked for Merrill Lynch since April, 1970, said Richard 
Silverman, a company spokesman, but he declined to discuss any details about 
Stamenson's work for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Records kept by the state and securities market overseers show no disciplinary 
action, lawsuits or complaints against Stamenson. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives on an oak-lined street -- called Merrill Circle North -- in a gated 
community in the affluent town of Moraga, east of Oakland, and owns a 1993 
Mercedes-Benz and a 1993 Jeep. His 13-room house -- with 5,200 square feet, 
three bedrooms, four baths and a swimming pool -- is assessed at $723,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Leopold Korens, chairman and chief executive of the Pacific Stock Exchange, 
declined to discuss Stamenson directly. But, he said, "One of the basic tenets 
of the brokerage business is to know your client, know what their capabilities 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Patrick Daly, chief investment officer of San Francisco, said Monday 
that he has not done business with Stamenson or Merrill Lynch for 12 years 
because of an earlier dispute. Daly said Stamenson proposed a short-term 
transaction in which the city would have realized a $17,000 profit; two days 
later, however, the city received only $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said that when called Stamenson to ask about the discrepancy, Stamenson 
told him it was a simple miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said that Merrill Lynch should make up the difference or forget doing 
business with the city of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never repaid the extra money, and I never did business with him again," 
Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, one's word is a contract, he said. "When we say something, 
we mean it."

O.C. FINANCIAL CRISIS; RAABE'S RISE THROUGH RANKS; SUCCESSOR: THE COUNTY'S 
ASSISTANT TREASURER FOR ONE YEAR, HE WAS HIGHLY TRUSTED BY CITRON, OBSERVERS 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in 24 years, the county has a new treasurer -- on an 
interim basis. Matthew Raabe, for the past year the county's assistant 
treasurer, was named acting treasurer Monday and will now manage a county 
investment profile that has plunged $1.5 billion in value since January. 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe, a county employee and civil servant for the past 10 years, will take 
over the treasurer's portion of the position held since 1970 by Robert L. 
Citron, who resigned in the wake of the worst financial crisis in the history 
of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe will hold the job until at least January, when the Board of Supervisors 
is expected to make a permanent appointment. Assistant Tax Collector Gary J. 
Cowan will take over Citron's tax-collecting duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe's appointment as top financial officer was not entirely unexpected, 
county officials said. Since being named Citron's assistant a year ago, Raabe 
has increasingly taken on a larger and more vocal role for Citron, who 
previously was never one to share the spotlight, say county insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last couple of years, Matt has taken more of a leadership role," 
said Andrew V. Czorny, finance director of the Orange County Water District, 
which has $10 million in the county investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider acknowledged last week that 
although he doesn't know much about Raabe's background, he likes what he has 
seen of his work and added that he had come highly regarded by Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citron picked him," Schneider said during an interview last week. "I've been 
pretty impressed with his performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Where Citron was basically an investment strategist who was not good at 
communicating his activities, Raabe has the ability to simplify issues so most 
people can understand them, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of faith in him," Schneider said. "He's got the ability to 
discuss these complicated financial matters and explain them to the guy in the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the tense days of the past week, as news of the financial crisis 
was made public, Raabe was made spokesman of a "management team" of top 
administrators assigned to guide the county through the crisis. Raabe joined 
Citron, Schneider, Auditor-Controller Steve E. Lewis, County Counsel Terry C. 
Andrus and Finance Director Eileen T. Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe, a Santa Ana resident who is not married, is an Iowa native but a 
product of Orange County schools. After moving to Orange County with his family 
in 1960, he attended and graduated from Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana and 
then attended Cal State Fullerton, where he graduated in 1984 with a degree in 
business administration. 
</P>
<P>
 A month after graduating, in July, 1984, Raabe joined the county's 
auditor-controller's office as an auditor. While working as an auditor, Raabe 
became a certified public accountant and in 1987 he joined the county 
treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe first arrived in the public spotlight last spring during Citron's race 
for reelection when the county's investment strategies were being challenged. 
Raabe defended his boss throughout the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite challenger John J.W. Moorlach's claims, Citron was reelected last June 
to a seventh term. Profile: Matthew Raabe

 Assistant County Treasurer Matthew Raabe has been named acting county 
treasurer. A permanent replacement will be chosen in January. Some background 
on Raabe: 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 38  
</P>
<P>
 Education: Bachelor of arts in business administration, Cal State Fullerton, 
1984 
</P>
<P>
 Profession: Certified public accountant 
</P>
<P>
 Occupational background: Hired as auditor in auditor-controller's office upon 
graduation; became chief of treasury operations for county treasurer-tax 
collector's office, 1987; promoted to assistant treasurer, 1993

O.C. FINANCIAL CRISIS; DEBACLE MAY AFFECT CAPITAL PROJECTS; REPERCUSSIONS: 
OFFICIALS UNCERTAIN IF MONEY IS STILL AVAILABLE TO UPGRADE POLICE RADIOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A potential casualty of the Orange County bonds crisis is a $94-million 
project to expand and upgrade the emergency telecommunications system used by 
every law-enforcement agency in the region, county officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Motorola project stood out among dozens of capital expenditures 
whose uncertain fate local officials found themselves pondering as County 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron resigned amid what some were only 
half-jokingly calling "Bondgate." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to replace an outdated and overloaded radio network that emergency 
officials fear could impede their ability to respond to a disaster, the 
Motorola project was to be purchased with money from a county municipal bond 
sale. But officials now say the transaction will almost certainly have to be 
restructured in order to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like everyone else, we're concerned," said Motorola sales manager Ron 
Thompson. He said Motorola officials are keeping a watchful eye on the 
situation but have heard nothing from county officials to indicate that the 
project is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials as well as representatives of dozens of local agencies 
affected by the estimated $1.5-billion drop in the value of the county's 
investment portfolio said Monday that it was too soon to tell what 
capital-improvement projects, if any, might be curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
 But caution and guarded optimism were the watchwords. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Orange County Transportation Authority, officials were relying on 
assurances from the county that no capital projects would be affected, despite 
OCTA having $1.1 billion tied up in the county-run investment pool -- more than 
any other agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Transportation Corridor Agencies, which is building three 
major toll roads in Orange County, sounded more pessimistic. A spokeswoman for 
the agency, which has $306 million in the shaky investment portfolio, said 
Monday: "We're not making any statements. I think it's safe to say that, 
potentially, anything could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what had local officials concerned about the Motorola project, in which 
a state-of-the-art, 800-megahertz radio system would be bought for the 
Sheriff's Department and every police department in the county, according to 
Bert Scott, director of the county's General Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is slated to bear 30% of the cost, with individual cities funding 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a worst-case scenario being examined Monday, Scott said, the system 
would have to be scrapped, "meaning we're left with a system over 20 years old, 
on 400 megahertz, that is out of room and hopelessly outdated." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott sighed and said, "Right now, it's like trying to run the traffic on the 
Santa Ana Freeway on a two-lane dirt road. That's what we'd have to live with 
in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The existing system simply has more traffic than it can handle, "so if you 
call the police and want a cop to deal with something immediately," Scott said, 
"you face a very severe time problem in terms of how fast the response will be. 
All of this is under a cloud at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said the Motorola project, which has been in the works since the 1980s, 
is due for completion in 1997. The sum of $28 million -- in cash -- has been 
set aside toward the cost, with the rest to be funded by bond revenue that now 
could be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department officials could not be reached for comment Monday but in 
the past have called the need for the upgraded system imperative. Scott said 
any decision on what to do with the system is up to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the county's losses are on paper, so local officials don't know 
whether real money will be lost and actual projects might have to be axed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county can't pay, Scott said the financing could be carried by 
Motorola, the telecommunications company to which the contract was awarded. But 
unlike the county, which can issue tax-exempt bonds, Motorola's offering would 
be less attractive to buyers because they would have to pay taxes on any 
interest earned. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola's Thompson agreed that it has "always been a possibility" that the 
company would finance the system itself. 
</P>
<P>
 A private financing could also wind up increasing the overall cost of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really too soon to tell about any of this," Scott said. "We're exploring 
so many areas. . . . We just don't have the answers yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kenan, director of finance and administration at OCTA, said he too was 
looking for answers. Beginning in March, his agency's expenditure requirements 
will leap from the current $7 million a month to $15 million a month for such 
projects as a massive right-of-way acquisition and widening of the Santa Ana 
Freeway near Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've assured me that if we don't pull our money out prematurely, we'll 
realize no loss of security, no loss whatsoever," Kenan said. "So, at the 
present time, we're guardedly optimistic. But we desperately need more 
information, and we need it quick. At the moment, we're not very well informed, 
nor, for that matter, is anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing Kenan's view was Peer Swan, president of the Irvine Ranch Water 
District, which has capital expenditures of $30 million to $100 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan said the district has access to about $170 million in funds separate from 
the county, "so if we can't get the normal flow of funds from the county, we'll 
still be able to handle it."

O.C. FINANCIAL CRISIS; IRONY, OUTRAGE AT TAX OFFICE; REACTION: ONE MAN SEES 
HUMOR IN WAITING TO PAY BILL FROM OFFICIAL WHO RESIGNED. OTHERS SAY CITRON 
SHOULD BE JAILED.

 Dick Hamilton laughed aloud Monday as he held a batch of property tax bills on 
his way to the Orange County treasurer-tax collector's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of funny," said Hamilton, 67, of Fullerton. "All these tax bills 
have his name on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton was talking about County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, 
who resigned Monday amid a growing Orange County financial crisis brought on by 
some of Citron's investments of public money. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton was among several county residents lining up to pay their property 
taxes Monday before this week's deadline, and many had thoughts about the 
financial storm buffeting cities, school districts and public agencies with 
money in the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Sky Bassett, 47, who came to pay $71,000 in property taxes for apartments he 
manages in Garden Grove, said that "Bob Citron should be put in prison." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outrageous that he should deny the riskiness of the business during the 
(June) election when all along we had this problem," Bassett said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, David Salazar of San Juan Capistrano said he is not overly concerned 
that the investments will be lost. Salazar said public officials have a duty to 
find ways to increase the value of public funds by looking for "innovative but 
sensible" investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not opposed to innovative ways to lower the tax burden," Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was sentiment shared by Genaro Estrada, who said the losses could be 
recovered. He added that the danger may have been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they are using all our taxes for the investment portfolio," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Julie Spangler of Rancho Santa Margarita said that taxpayers' money should 
not be used for high-risk investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens when there is a huge loss?" Spangler said. "Even if the money 
goes back to the public, it should be placed in safe investments." 
</P>
<P>
 Beatrice Sidwell said that high-risk investments are like gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the idea of gambling with my money," said Sidwell, 77, of 
Fullerton. "I'm very careful with what I have."

O.C. FINANCIAL CRISIS; FUND CRASH TRACES BACK TO STATE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY and H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The roots of Orange County's ballooning financial crisis stretch back to a 
seemingly innocuous change made in state law more than a decade ago by a 
gaffe-prone local assemblyman at the behest of County Treasurer-Tax Collector 
Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's sales technique was simple. In pushing for the change, he repeatedly 
assured state officials in letters and memos that the legislation would simply 
codify what county treasurers had been doing for years -- making a quick profit 
for the public by dabbling in repurchase and reverse-repurchase agreements, 
financial instruments known as "repos." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are among the investments that have Orange County's financial portfolio 
teetering at the abyss, prompting Citron to resign under fire as federal 
regulators scrutinize the troubled fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Few dreamed it would come to this when Citron and Orange County's 
then-Assemblyman Chester (Chet) Wray pushed for the law authorizing repos back 
in 1979. Wray's bill was supported by the County Treasurers Assn. of 
California, the city of San Francisco, the treasurers of Los Angeles, Kings and 
Inyo counties and the Municipal Finance Officers Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to then-Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., Citron made the proposal 
sound like a winner for all concerned. The change, he said, "would give 
increasing investment latitude to local treasurers to enable them to increase 
their interest earnings for the taxpayers they serve." All the bill did, he 
said, was "to stamp into law what the local treasurers have been doing by 
practice for many years." 
</P>
<P>
 It was one among several letters Citron dispatched during the course of 
pushing for the bill carried by Wray, a three-term lawmaker best known in the 
Capitol for mistakenly reading a speech twice on the floor, thus earning the 
lasting nickname "Chet Wray Chet." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Wray gaffed again during a bitter speakership fight. The Assembly's 
Democrats were evenly split between Leo T. McCarthy (D-San Francisco) and 
Howard Berman (D-Los Angeles), but when a head count was taken it was learned 
that Wray had committed support to both men. Wray lost to Assemblywoman Doris 
Allen (R-Cypress) in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wray able to provide only limited clout in the Capitol, Citron proved 
instrumental in pushing the bill through the Legislature without a single vote 
against it on the floor. That's illustrative of the way politics works in 
Sacramento. Amid the political hubbub, technically complex issues can get 
precious little review. 
</P>
<P>
 The only strong dissent to Wray's bill came from powerful former state 
Treasurer Jesse Unruh, who expressed concern that the measure granted too much 
discretion to local treasurers lacking the sophistication to speculate on the 
ebb and flow of financial markets. Unruh declared that repos were "fraught with 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron worked fiercely to turn Unruh around on the issue. In a letter to Unruh 
early on in the fight, he suggested that "it hardly takes any acumen" to do a 
repo. Citron also bluntly charged that Unruh opposed Wray's bill because the 
influential politician, known as "Big Daddy" around the Capitol, wanted to 
ensure that local governments would continue to invest in the financial 
portfolio he managed for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Unruh dropped his opposition, in part because Wray agreed to link 
his repo bill to a measure championed by the state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Citron has often taken credit for writing Wray's bill, former county 
employees familiar with the process used by Orange County officials during the 
1970s to push county-sponsored legislation in Sacramento said its origin was 
more complex. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the county had a legislative planning committee made up of 
selected administrators that screened all state legislation proposed by Orange 
County. A bill's final language was written by the county counsel and approved 
by the Board of Supervisors before the measure was handed to a legislator to 
introduce in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citron took credit for drafting this bill, but the process then was to have 
the county counsel work on the language and then the legislative planning 
committee approve it. Ultimately, the supervisors also had to OK it," said 
Clayton Parker, who was with the county counsel's office from 1959 to 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, who is now in private practice, also served as the county's lobbyist 
in Sacramento in 1961 and 1963, when he monitored legislation in which county 
officials were interested.

ALREADY A REPUBLICAN OUTCAST, HORCHER MAKES BREAK OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slamming his hand on his desk and shouting, "Brown!," Republican Assemblyman 
Paul Horcher on Monday emphatically defected from his party by casting his vote 
for Assembly Speaker for Democrat Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The maverick lawmaker declared that he was becoming the Assembly's only 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher's dramatic action triggered a 40-40 stalemate in California's lower 
legislative house and once again propelled the trial lawyer from Diamond Bar 
into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an independent, I will be free of political party bosses and better able 
to fight for my constituents," Horcher, 43, declared in a prepared statement. 
He said he had paid his dues, noting his support for Gov. Pete Wilson's state 
budgets when many of his GOP colleagues abandoned the Republican governor. In 
1991, Horcher cast the 54th and deciding vote for the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the wake of that vote, Brown took good care of Horcher, naming him vice 
chairman of a key budget committee over objections by Assembly Republican 
Leader Jim Brulte. With the position, Horcher received additional staff. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, Horcher, who criticized the rightward tilt among Assembly 
Republicans, turned into something of an outcast within his own caucus. He was 
criticized for favoring abortion rights and for aligning himself with the 
traditionally Democratic California Trial Lawyers Assn. The antipathy was 
heightened last year during an unsuccessful effort at the state Republican 
Party convention to censure Horcher for accepting his Ways and Means Committee 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 But the contempt for Horcher never broke into the open, as it did Monday when 
Republican Trice Harvey of Bakersfield in a floor speech called Horcher a 
"political whore." Horcher said Assembly sergeants at arms escorted him off the 
floor at day's end because of anonymous death threats received in his Capitol 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Texas, Horcher earned a bachelor's degree in political science 
from Cal Poly Pomona and graduated from La Verne University College of Law 
before passing the State Bar in 1978. He and his wife, Van Le, a refugee from 
Vietnam, have two daughters. He was first elected to the Assembly in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered a proud and independent lawmaker by his colleagues, Horcher has 
been on the political hot seat ever since the Nov. 8 election made it clear 
that Republicans would have a razor-thin majority in the Assembly. Initially, 
Horcher said he might run for Speaker and rally moderates. 
</P>
<P>
 But no such move was attempted Monday. Instead, Horcher, cast his lot with the 
controversial Brown and, according to Republicans, immediately became a 
possible recall target.

SKIER MISSING 2 DAYS IS FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Searchers found a missing San Francisco Bay Area man alive at Squaw Valley USA 
on Monday, nearly 48 hours after he was last seen at the resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Squaw Valley spokeswoman Janna Garza said Alan Austin, 45, was spotted from a 
helicopter Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Garza said Austin apparently was unharmed by his ordeal, but said she had no 
details. He was expected to be flown to Truckee-Tahoe Hospital in Truckee. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin, of Atherton, was last seen late Saturday. He was skiing with his two 
daughters and told them he wanted to take one final trip down the resort's 
KT-22 run before quitting for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 He was spotted on the Alpine Meadows side of the KT ridge, Garza said. His 
discovery came after resort ski patrol members conducted extensive sweeps of 
the run and adjoining runs along with Tahoe Nordic Search and Rescue Team 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said wet deep snow and high winds hampered search efforts. A weekend 
storm left nearly three feet of new snow at the resort.

118 FREEWAY NAMED AFTER RONALD REAGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With fond words for the nation's 40th President, the state Senate on Monday 
overwhelmingly approved designating the Simi Valley-San Fernando Valley Freeway 
as the Ronald Reagan Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day of the 1995-96 legislative session, the Senate voted 38 to 0 
to re-christen the entire length of the freeway, California 118, in honor of 
the two-term President from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), a co-author of the resolution along 
with Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), had urged colleagues to 
approve the action, in part because the freeway leads to the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library in Simi Valley.

WHITE HOUSE'S EX-TRAVEL CHIEF FACES INDICTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
from From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former chief of the White House travel office expects to be indicted on 
embezzlement charges, his attorney said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Billy R. Dale said federal prosecutors plan to ask a grand 
jury Wednesday or Friday to charge Dale with stealing $69,000 in money paid by 
news organizations for their reporters' travel with the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale was fired in a purge of the travel office in May, 1993. An audit that 
month found the office kept sloppy records. 
</P>
<P>
 But controversy began when it was learned that initial complaints came from 
Catherine A. Cornelius, a 25-year-old distant cousin of President Clinton, who 
was assigned to the office, and from Harry Thomason, a Hollywood producer and 
close friend of the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale, 57, began work at the White House more than 30 years ago and in 1982 
took charge of the travel office, where he was paid about $75,000 a year. He is 
starting a legal defense fund, said his attorney, Steven C. Tabackman. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one who has worked with Billy Ray Dale or who has had any contact with him 
either personally or professionally during the 31 years that he served the 
White House and the media believes for an instant that Mr. Dale embezzled a 
cent from the travel office," Tabackman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabackman acknowledged that the government can show $55,000 going from the 
travel office to Dale's bank account between 1982 and early 1992 and he says 
prosecutors also allege Dale converted $14,000 cash to his own use in 1992-93.

TODDLER TRIPS BURGLAR DETECTOR, SHOT TO DEATH

 A toddler enthralled by Christmas tree lights tripped an anti-crime motion 
detector in his living room and was shot to death by his stepmother, who had 
mistaken the 3-year-old for a burglar, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Hicks' death was ruled an accident, and police planned no charges 
against his stepmother, whom they refused to identify. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, the woman grabbed a .38-caliber handgun and fired when she 
saw movement. Jonathan was shot in the head as he stood inches from the 
Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved Christmas lights. He just liked looking at it," said his 
grandmother, Georgia Hicks.

COURT WON'T REVIEW DEADLY FORCE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
from From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court will not review a ruling that allows police to shoot 
defendants who try to escape while awaiting criminal trials, even if they are 
unarmed and not dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The court also turned down the appeal of a Florida man who said a Halloween 
celebration at his sons' elementary school offended his family by including 
brooms, caldrons and teachers dressed as witches.He said use of such symbols in 
a public school violates the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 In the deadly force case, the justices, without comment, let stand an earlier 
ruling that police may not shoot unarmed, fleeing criminal suspects who pose no 
immediate danger, if they had not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involved Roland Brothers Jr., who was arrested in Jersey Village, 
Tex., for auto theft in November, 1988. He was turned over to Harris County 
sheriff's deputies for transfer to the county jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers, who had escaped twice before, somehow removed his restraints and 
fled. The deputies shouted at him to stop, but he did not. They then drew their 
guns and fired 12 times, killing him. 
</P>
<P>
 His family sued, attacking as unconstitutional the policy that allows deputies 
to shoot in such circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Halloween case, the court turned away Robert L. Guyer's argument that 
Halloween symbols are religious symbols. Guyer had sued the Alachua County, 
Fla., school board over the issue.

SCHOOLS FACE 2-YEAR DELAY IN QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles city school officials said Monday it will take workers until the 
fall of 1996 to make an estimated $100 million in repairs needed for schools 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake -- a delay of nearly two years because of 
federal red tape and the widespread nature of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Sid Thompson had previously said 
repairs would be completed, or at least under way, by January, 1995. But 
Thompson and other district officials said Monday that the pace has been 
hampered by complicated federal-assistance paperwork and the large number of 
repair projects -- more than 1,200 at about 300 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special Board of Education meeting Monday, members expressed 
disappointment at the slow pace even though the unfinished repairs pose no 
danger to students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have trouble looking at the schools and saying, 'By 1997 or '98 . . . 
things will be fine," said board President Mark Slavkin. "It's not fast 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin said federal officials had indicated shortly after the Jan. 17 quake 
that the government would "move mountains" to allocate money for school 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense now is that it's gone back to the long, drawn-out process," Slavkin 
said. "I don't think the President is holding Cabinet meetings on how to repair 
the Los Angeles Unified School District. I think they've moved on to other 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they are working with the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency and the state Office of Emergency Services to get the schools inspected 
and the repair projects funded. That process, however, has been more 
complicated and time-consuming than officials had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial school inspections were finished just in the last month, officials 
said. In many cases, FEMA has required additional site inspections, especially 
for larger, more expensive projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The district does not want to proceed with repair projects until FEMA agrees 
to pay for the jobs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to walk in step with FEMA so the district doesn't end up owing a 
lot of money in the long run," said Julie Crum, who oversees the district's 
design and construction branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's meeting was the first time district officials gave an estimated cost 
of the district's total earthquake damage. Doug Brown, who oversees the 
district's facilities management branch, said he believes repairs could run 
even higher than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Classroom buildings, gyms and lunch areas remain cordoned off at many 
campuses, mostly in the San Fernando Valley. Repair delays have upset many at 
Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can repair our freeways in the quickness that we did, what about 
schools?" said Bob Kladifko, the Reseda High School principal. A classroom 
building there is still unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are freeways more important than kids? I don't think so but that's the 
question that parents are asking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake seriously damaged about 150 schools, with 18 campuses closed 
for three or four weeks after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from Van Gogh Elementary are still attending classes on the Frost 
Middle School campus. District officials say it will take until September, 
1998, to rebuild Van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real and Kennedy high schools were each closed for six weeks. 
Kennedy's administration building will not be rebuilt until August, 1998. At 
Cleveland High, an outdoor canopy serves as the lunchroom while the cafeteria 
remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half, or 20, of the city's high school gymnasiums were closed after the 
quake, and 752 classrooms were declared unusable at 64 schools. In addition, 98 
auditoriums and multipurpose rooms sustained significant damage. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said 226 earthquake-repair projects have been completed or 
are under way, 435 are in the planning phase and 120 still need an engineering 
evaluation to satisfy federal requirements. Another 428 projects await FEMA 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has so far paid for about half of the needed repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The most-costly repair projects have not yet been approved because the federal 
government requires several evaluations by qualified engineers and architects, 
district officials said. The district has hired about 455 workers for 
earthquake repairs. "We've been a revolving door in terms of hiring people," 
said Margaret Scholl, who oversees the maintenance and operations branch. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said it has been difficult to find qualified professionals who will 
work in temporary positions. The district is continuing to hire outside 
contractors for the bulk of the earthquake-repair projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from repairing damaged schools, the district also is trying to replace 
lighting and suspended ceilings at all its campuses. Officials said they trying 
to get federal funds for pay for those improvements, which would ostensibly 
make the schools safer during another earthquake.

VALLEY GOP STRESSES TIES TO GINGRICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Newt Gingrich may be controversial to some, but San Fernando Valley-area 
Republicans stood solidly behind the incoming Speaker of the House on Monday in 
what amounted to a day of celebration for the long-frustrated GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you know the guy who has the clout," one Republican congressional aide 
explained, "you have some clout yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 As Gingrich formally accepted his nomination as Speaker, Rep. Howard (Buck) 
McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) was one who was playing up his ties to the next House 
leader, calling himself a close ally of the Georgia lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon has proudly noted that Gingrich appeared at one of his fund-raisers 
earlier this year and named McKeon to the transition team that is preparing for 
the start of the 104th Congress next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've worked pretty closely with the Speaker-elect on a number of projects," 
said Bob Cochran, McKeon's chief of staff. "Once a month, Buck has been meeting 
with Gingrich and other leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite as tight is Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), who was slighted by 
Gingrich last month when the incoming Speaker bypassed him for two committee 
chairmanships. Still, Moorhead refuses to knock Gingrich and vows to work 
closely with him as a subcommittee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support the new administration," Moorhead said. "We're all working together 
to carry out the terms of the 'Contract with America' and bring about the 
reforms in Congress that are so badly needed." 
</P>
<P>
 In his characteristically controversial way, Gingrich caused a stir over the 
weekend when he suggested that a quarter of President Clinton's aides had used 
drugs in the four to five years before they joined the Administration. He also 
urged Hillary Rodham Clinton to see the movie "Boys Town" before condemning his 
support of orphanages for welfare children. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet criticism of Gingrich's loose tongue was hard to find among Republicans 
gathered at their leadership meetings Monday, which at times took on the air of 
a high school pep rally. Gingrich himself has said he intends to tone down his 
fierce rhetoric when he assumes the House leadership Jan. 4 and begins work on 
government reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) stuck up for Gingrich, whom he says he has 
known for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The press is out there looking for the 1% of the remarks that are going to be 
controversial," Gallegly said. "I can't speak to the specifics of his recent 
remarks, but Newt is a guy who is not going to shrink away from controversy. 
But he is intelligent enough to push our agenda forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, on the other hand, were watching Gingrich's ascension with 
apprehension and acknowledging far more tenuous ties with the 
Speaker-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 A Democratic policy group proposed a set of options to counter those being 
pushed by Gingrich and vowed to -- in the words of Al From, president of the 
Democratic Leadership Council -- "engage (the Republicans) in hand-to-hand 
combat for every inch of ground in the battlefield for ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), 
for their part, do not profess to be close confidantes of the next Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman knows Gingrich but does not have a particularly close relationship, a 
staffer said, and Berman knows Gingrich primarily from an overseas trip the two 
took with other Congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "They at least know each other by sight," a Berman aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gingrich and other Republican leaders now selected, the GOP turns its 
sights to committee and subcommittee assignments, which local lawmakers are 
awaiting anxiously. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those under consideration for subcommittee chairs are Moorhead, who is 
expected to head the subcommittee on intellectual property and judicial 
administration, and Gallegly, who is pushing for the chairmanship of 
international law, immigration and refugees. They will learn their fates by 
midweek. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democrats have lost their chance to wield the gavel, they also have 
an interest in the results of this week's Republican caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman, chairman of the international operations subcommittee, and Waxman, who 
chairs the subcommittee on health and environment, will learn how Republicans 
lawmakers plan to overhaul their panels. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a greater ratio of Republicans on the committees, GOP lawmakers 
have proposed cutting committee staffing, consolidating some committees and 
even selling a House office building.

MIKE DOWNEY: RAIDERS WERE READY AND ABLE FOR MONDAY NIGHT REDEMPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somewhere between Hank Williams Jr.'s opening number and their last stupid 
penalty, the Raiders played some really fine football Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 This team can play this game when it wants. I don't know what was more fun, 
driving down listening to callers on XTRA all-sports radio saying how the 
Chargers were going to whip the Raiders (with the host replying: "OK, thanks! 
Great call!") or watching the game itself, which was attended by a record 
number of Charger boltheads. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders needed this one more than San Diego did. They were terrible in the 
season opener on a Monday night in San Francisco and equally terrible in the 
biggest game of the season eight days ago against Pittsburgh. The word chokers 
was warming up in the bullpen for the Raiders were they not ready for this game 
with San Diego. Coaches and fans alike were fed up. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were ready. They were so ready that once again they overeagerly 
committed penalty after penalty -- including offsides on three 
back-to-back-to-back plays. They also got no help at all from a crew of 
officials that called penalties whenever the Raiders breathed hard on Charger 
quarterback Stan Humphries, but never once tooted their whistles when Raider 
quarterback Jeff Hostetler got mashed like a potato. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything that went wrong, however, the Raiders overcame. There was 
redemption for Dan Land, who nearly decapitated a Charger with a foolish 
penalty early on, but later made a sensational effort in running down a kick 
returner to save a touchdown. Same for punter Jeff Gossett, who put the Raiders 
in a poor spot with an uncharacteristic 14-yard shank, but came through on his 
final punt by burying the Chargers at their own eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Raiders came through -- some we've been waiting for all season. Alexander 
Wright opened the scoring and Rocket Ismail closed it, each making smooth, 
smooth moves. On defense, little-known Alberto White made a number of big 
plays, among them a whack of Humphries' arm on the quarterback's final 
third-down pass. Then James Trapp took care of San Diego's fourth-down pass, 
and the game was theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and let us not diminish what Vince Evans did, stepping in for Hostetler on 
a minute's notice and firing a perfect touchdown pass to Ismail, who is finally 
starting to get the ball thrown to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Or what Wes Bender did, filling in at fullback for Tom Rathman more than ever 
before. Or even Dan Turk, who took over at center for Don Mosebar, who did not 
look particularly happy about being taken out. The Raiders immediately marched 
downfield for a touchdown, with Turk upending Charger linemen as easily as I 
might flip open a laptop computer. 
</P>
<P>
 All these players came through in the nick of time, for the Raiders needed all 
the help they could get. Once the masters of Monday night, they had fallen on 
hard times. There were too many mistakes and too much squabbling and too many 
controversies and too much of everything except winning. One more defeat and 
this team that considered itself a Super Bowl contender would not even own a 
winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrations were boiling over. Nolan Harrison took hold of 295-pound San 
Diego tackle Stan Brock and threw him to the ground. Hostetler wagged a finger 
in an official's face. Coach Art Shell shouted angrily from the sideline after 
another non-call. Hostetler got chased out of bounds by Junior Seau, turned and 
pitched the football at him. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't sure for the longest time if the Raiders could overlook these things 
and get around to winning. Their play got so sloppy at times, their heads 
didn't seem to be in the game. Land creamed a Charger return man before the 
ball even got there. And cornerback Donald Frank did some of the weakest 
tackling in the history of professional football on a San Diego touchdown pass, 
seven seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 But by mixing up their plays offensively and confusing the Chargers with 
different looks -- "We tried zone, 'man' and blitz, and nothing worked," San 
Diego defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger said later -- the Raiders refused 
to fall apart. Nothing fazed them, not the endless whistle-blowing and not the 
full cups of drinks hurled at the Raiders by fans in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you make stupid mistakes," Charger defensive leader Leslie O'Neal said, 
"it doesn't matter what you do defensively. When the Raiders are hot, they are 
going to be tough against anybody they play. Tonight was one of those nights." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more blunt was Stanley Richard, a Charger free safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what his team could learn from this, Richard said: "We learned it 
doesn't feel good to get a whuppin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows this better than the Raiders, who got whupped by San Francisco 
and Seattle and Pittsburgh until they were good and sore. Their whole season 
was hanging on what happened here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened was, they finally played the way they know how.

RAVITCH WON'T SEEK EXTENSION; BASEBALL: CONTRACT ENDS DEC. 31 FOR AUTHOR OF 
SALARY-CAP PROPOSAL WHO HAS BEEN REPLACED AS OWNERS' CHIEF NEGOTIATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, who was recently replaced as chief labor negotiator for the 
major league baseball owners but whose salary-cap proposal they may soon 
implement, said Monday he will not seek an extension when his contract expires 
Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch was hired at $750,000 a year in November 1991 to help develop a new 
economic system. He said it was never his intention to stay in baseball beyond 
the life of the contract, and that he had no anger or bitterness over what has 
seemed to be a diminishing role in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only emotion is one of sadness in that we have been unable to reach a 
collective bargaining agreement that would insure the future viability of 
baseball," he said. "I thought we could do it in two years. I never dreamed it 
would take three or four, but the owners have the situation well in hand and 
that's the way it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point only the owners can make the decision as to what is acceptable 
and what is not. Hopefully, the next round of talks will produce an agreement. 
If not, we're headed for a long siege of suits and countersuits, and my 
presence isn't required in court. I don't feel I'm leaving the owners in the 
lurch." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners are in a holding pattern, waiting for resumption of bargaining 
talks in Rye Brook, N.Y., on Friday, a last-gasp attempt to reach a negotiated 
settlement before they meet in Chicago on Dec. 15 to declare an impasse and 
unilaterally implement the salary-cap proposal. That move will prompt the 
players' union to seek injunctive relief through the National Labor Relations 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners bowed to pressure from special mediator William J. Usery last week 
and agreed to postpone that meeting for 10 days to give the union a chance to 
meet with constituents in Atlanta this week and formulate a counterproposal to 
the payroll tax plan submitted by the owners on Nov. 17.  
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-eight striking players vowed Monday not to give in to owners -- even 
if it means sitting out next season and possibly not playing again. 
</P>
<P>
 In the largest meeting of major leaguers since the strike began Aug. 12, 
players opened a three-day session by reiterating their solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never back down," Texas pitcher Kevin Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Milwaukee pitcher Bob Scanlan, "There's a good chance at this point that 
we're not going to be playing baseball in 1995. I have to make decisions based 
on this assumption." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta pitcher Tom Glavine admitted a few major leaguers may play as strike 
breakers if the owners try to start the 1995 season with replacement players, 
although Kansas City pitcher David Cone didn't seem to believe too many would. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the stigma that you're going to carry that for the rest of your 
career, maybe the rest of your life, is enough," Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Fehr, the union leader, had little reaction to Ravitch's decision, 
other than to say that the negotiations "have been driven by the desire of the 
owners and not their negotiator." Fehr had once referred to Ravitch as a 
"hatchet man" for the owners and was consistently critical of him in public and 
private comments. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sources said his relationship with Ravitch improved as their contact 
began to diminish in September, when owner Jerry McMorris of the Colorado 
Rockies and Chief Executive Officer John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox 
initiated direct communication with the union on the approval of acting 
commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington recently replaced Ravitch as lead negotiator in a move urged by 
Usery, sources said, to create a more conciliatory and moderate atmosphere -- 
"the old good-cop, bad-cop routine," a management official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch, 61, said he encouraged that change because it made "common sense to 
have an owner at the head of the owners' negotiating committee at a time when 
it's the owners who will have to decide what's agreeable to them and what's 
not. If Don or anyone else puts a hard-line spin on it, that's ridiculous. I 
welcomed the change." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch also said he has never responded to Fehr's criticisms and wouldn't 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always said that baseball needs a strong union," Ravitch said. "My 
disagreement with Don is that he has never acknowledged the meritorious 
argument that baseball needs a new system to survive, and he has operated on 
the assumption the owners would eventually cave in. It's been bizarre because 
of that. I mean, there has never really been any negotiation, but I feel good 
about the way I've articulated the economic problems to the public and to the 
owners." 
</P>
<P>
 It took Ravitch more than a year to get the often self-centered owners to aid 
their less fortunate with a new revenue-sharing formula linked to the cap, but 
they have displayed unprecedented unanimity in pursuit of the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick Ravitch was instrumental in helping the clubs recognize the seriousness 
of the economic problems of the industry and then create a solution to resolve 
those problems," Selig said. "He ran interference for it. He deserves an awful 
lot of credit for it. We are grateful for his efforts and wish him well in 
future pursuits." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig denied reports that his own relationship with Ravitch -- a candidate for 
New York City mayor in 1989 and former New York Transit Authority chairman -- 
had deteriorated, but he refused to say if Ravitch would have been offered an 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners -- never sure of their own commitment and with no control over 
intervening commissioners -- have experienced a frequent turnover in labor 
leaders over the last 20 years. The next commissioner, under terms of a 
restructuring that has been approved by the owners, will have full control over 
labor matters, which is ironic because Ravitch, Selig and others led the push 
that forced Fay Vincent out of office in September 1992 when he refused to 
yield any of his labor authority after intervening to end the 1991 lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 A new commissioner will not be hired until a new labor agreement is reached.

SLO IN A FAST LANE; CAL POLY FACES GROWING PAINS AS IT TRIES TO BRING DIVISION 
I SPORTS TO CENTRAL COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new kids on the chopping block live here, playing in a nondescript 
gymnasium on a sleepy campus nestled among rolling hills and fertile farmland 
in the shadow of Madonna Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 One preseason poll had the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Mustangs ranked last among 
the NCAA's 302 Division I men's basketball teams. In another, the Mustangs were 
No. 301. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Steve Beason expected as much, especially since Cal Poly was 9-16 last 
season against competition substantially inferior to what it will face in its 
first season in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being the one and only new Division I team in the nation, we probably deserve 
to start at the bottom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just so long as the Mustangs don't stay there. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly, a university perhaps best known for its agricultural and high-tech 
dairy programs, is poised for an ambitious push toward establishing a 
top-flight athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
 Future renovation of the school's 4,000-seat Mott Gym marks only the start of 
a campaign that Athletic Director John McCutcheon hopes will provide Cal Poly 
state-of-the-art sports facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Where sheep now graze on grassland adjacent to California 1 heading toward 
picturesque Morro Bay, McCutcheon envisions a $15-million complex that would 
include a 15,000-seat football stadium, a 3,000-seat baseball stadium and a 
1,000-seat softball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, such facilities are dreams captured only in artists' renderings 
tucked away in McCutcheon's office. But wheels are in motion. Donations of 
$225,000 have been solicited to finance feasibility studies, and the tentative 
construction site has been approved by the school's master planning committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Small town. Big plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of San Luis Obispo, which some folks refer to as "SLO Town" because 
of its leisurely pace, has a population of about 45,000. Cal Poly, a scenic 
expanse of 5,500 acres, has an enrollment of 15,400 students who must 
occasionally absorb eau de barnyard animal when the wind blows from the south. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the school has a sterling academic reputation and an alumni base of 
about 85,000 -- mostly in California, and several with deep pockets. Television 
sportscaster John Madden, a former Mustang player and coach, is an annual 
contributor to the athletic coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have 5,000 people who contribute $1,000 (to athletics) annually," 
McCutcheon said. "What we do have is a handful of people with very significant 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly also has a place in an established conference, giving the Mustangs a 
leg up on Cal State Northridge and Cal State Sacramento, two other state-system 
schools that in recent years have tried to boost the level of their athletic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the 1996-97 school year, Cal Poly will be a member of the Big 
West Conference, a model-perfect alliance for the Mustangs both competitively 
and geographically. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, Northridge, one of Cal Poly's former Division II rivals, is in its 
fifth year in Division I and still has not found a permanent home for its 
athletic teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge has some teams in the fledging, four-member American West 
Conference; baseball and softball as affiliates in the Western Athletic 
Conference; men's volleyball and soccer in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation and other sports as independents. 
</P>
<P>
 For the short term, Cal Poly is in a similar situation with football, 
cross-country, basketball, track and women's tennis teams in the American West; 
baseball in the WAC; wrestling in the Pacific 10 and soccer, women's 
volleyball, swimming, softball and men's tennis programs as independents. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly would have stumbled had its students not passed a referendum to 
provide additional funding for athletics in November 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In the biggest turnout in state college history, more than 10,000 Cal Poly 
students voted on whether to tax themselves on a graduating scale up to $43 a 
student per quarter to support the school's sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which will add an estimated $2.3 million to the athletic budget 
next year, passed by 253 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the referendum's passage, Cal Poly coaches were on three-month 
contracts and the school's 17-sport athletic program was on the brink of being 
pared to eight. Swimmers were holding themselves out of meets so they could 
retain an extra year of eligibility should they have to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a fish-or-cut-bait situation," McCutcheon said. "If the referendum 
fails, Cal Poly remains Division II -- and probably at the lower end of that 
level." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar referendum recently was narrowly defeated at Northridge, prompting 
school officials there to consider cutting some athletic programs, football 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal Poly, the additional funding covers travel, equipment and some 
salaries. Athletic scholarships come from ticket revenue, a separate student 
fee of $4 a student per semester, plus an annual $150,000 donation from a 
foundation that controls money generated by the university's bookstore, food 
services and dorms. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials are relying on alumni and community supporters to provide the 
funds for improved facilities, thereby completing McCutcheon's three-tiered 
recipe for success. 
</P>
<P>
 Early indications are encouraging. Beason said that during what he had 
anticipated would be a quick promotional stop at a local Rotary Club lunch, he 
was peppered with questions for more than 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Chuck Sleeper, Cal Poly's assistant athletic director in charge of fund 
raising: "There are people who ask, 'How do you expect to compete with UCLA and 
Stanford?' But I run into more people who say, 'Why aren't you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the ranks of those elite schools will take time and plenty of money, 
even though Cal Poly plans to keep its football team at the Division I-AA 
level, competing against schools such as Idaho and Montana of the Big Sky 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The best attribute of 8,000-seat Mustang Stadium, home to Cal Poly's football 
and soccer teams, is an adjacent grassy area convenient for tailgate parties.  
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly's baseball team, a Division II finalist in 1993, plays off campus at 
Sinsheimer Park, a municipal facility on the outskirts of town where umpires 
must duck inside the press box to change. The Mustangs share the field with San 
Luis Obispo High and an American Legion team. 
</P>
<P>
 Softball is played on campus at a makeshift field surrounded by chicken coops 
and pastures. Home runs to left field have been known to send feathers flying, 
and cows have been known to mosey over for a look-see. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that drawback, softball Coach Lisa Boyer successfully recruited 
Desarie Knipfer of Soquel High in Santa Cruz. She averaged 15.2 strikeouts per 
seven innings last season, setting a national high school record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Facilities are the only piece of the puzzle not in place," Beason said. "Once 
we do that, there's no reason we can't compete on a par with everyone in the 
Big West." 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon is confident that the necessary money can be raised, even in these 
restrictive economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't give to a debt, but they'll give to a dream," he said. "It's 
like investing in stock." 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't expect to see Cal Poly's marquee investment, its men's basketball 
program, paying dividends any time soon. The Mustangs, 1-11 away from Mott Gym 
last season, will log 30,122 miles and visit nine states in playing 17 of 26 
regular-season games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one here has put any pressure on us to win right away," Beason said. 
"We're young, we're building, we're spreading the word." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly last year was the highest-rated public university in the western 
United States, according to a study by U.S. News and World Report. Beason is 
confident the school's athletic program will take a similar place. 
</P>
<P>
 He also knows it will be an uphill climb. He remembers meeting a man after a 
tournament game in the Midwest a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The man said he knew of Cal Poly, home of the human-powered helicopter and 
those entertaining Rose Bowl scoreboard pranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Beason didn't have the heart to tell him he was thinking of Caltech.

RAMS NOT DONE, THEY JUST LOOK LIKE IT; PRO FOOTBALL: NEXT UP IS TAMPA BAY, AND 
QUESTIONS ABOUND -- ABOUT THE STARTING QUARTERBACK, THE COACH AND THE 
FRANCHISE'S FUTURE HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 If the New York Giants finish at 7-9, including a victory over Philadelphia, 
which would also have to go 7-9, they get the tie-breaking nod over Atlanta, 
Green Bay and Arizona -- assuming each closes at 7-9 -- and then all the Rams 
have to do is win three games in a row for the first time since 1989 to gain 
the tie-breaking edge on New York and advance to the playoffs as the NFC's 
final wild-card entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Rams' grueling schedule works against them. This week they must 
play Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers -- repeat, the Buccaneers -- are favored to defeat the Rams in 
Sunday's Relocation Bowl in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won two in a row, so they're playing good," said Ram quarterback Chris 
Chandler. "You can't say, 'Oh, we're playing Tampa . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 No, the Rams really can't say that about any team these days. The Rams have 
lost 47 of their last 65 games, and the Monday morning excuses have become as 
lame as their performance in Sunday's 31-15 loss to the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got behind the eight-ball," said Ram quarterback Chris Miller. "And we 
were too far behind to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 And just how frustrated is this team? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's kind of a weekly question, I guess," Miller said. "You can just say 
we're more frustrated this week than we were last week." 
</P>
<P>
 Another weekly question: Who starts at quarterback for the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to wait and see what the health situation is on both of the 
quarterbacks," Coach Chuck Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who is 2-7 as a starter, landed on his head after rookie Wayne Gandy 
missed a block on Saint defensive end Wayne Martin. Miller left the game and it 
was announced he had suffered a concussion, his second of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said Monday, however, that he was "dinged," and that doesn't qualify as 
a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was dinged, rattled for a minute," said Miller, who sat out three games 
after suffering his first concussion against New Orleans the first time the 
Rams played the Saints. "My neck's a little stiff, but my head's clear and I'm 
feeling fine." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Miller expect to start this week? 
</P>
<P>
 "I would anticipate it, yeah," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Chandler, who is 2-2 as a starter, think he deserves the opportunity to 
start? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to answer that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to," Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, who took a painkilling shot for bruised ribs before Sunday's game, 
has been sidelined with a sore ankle. If ready to play, there is no doubt he 
remains the coaching staff's preferred candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what they're thinking at all," said Chandler, who becomes a 
free agent at season's end. "Being certain about things always makes you feel 
better, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty, though, will shadow the Rams for the rest of the season. Who is 
the team's long-term choice at quarterback? Will Knox be back next season to 
make such a decision? Will the team be back in Anaheim next year? Just what has 
happened to this team? 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say I'm disappointed, because my expectations were high going into 
the season, based on the fact that we had turned around three other programs," 
Knox said. "But I don't have a particular answer for why . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Therein may lie the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to win all three (remaining games) and finish as strongly as we 
can," Knox said. "I think we can win the last three games. I think we're 
capable of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's just up to the Giants, Eagles, Falcons, Packers and Cardinals to 
cooperate.

NFL COMMISSIONER TAGLIABUE SAYS COLISEUM STILL HAS MANY PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his strongest comments yet about the Coliseum, NFL Commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue said Monday that he is not certain that problems with the facility 
are "solvable," and said he continues to work toward building a new stadium in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been problems with the Coliseum, and there continue to be 
problems," Tagliabue said."I don't know if they are solvable. 
</P>
<P>
 "(It) is not a state-of-the-art facility, nobody should delude themselves into 
thinking that it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had meetings with Mayor (Richard) Riordan in the last couple of weeks, 
we've met with members of the private sector in Los Angeles to talk about 
stadium opportunities. It's all under review." 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue said the area should not worry about losing both the Rams and 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's very unlikely," he said. "We are working through the 
difficulties and will continue to have strong representation in Southern 
California. . . . We will be represented with at least one, possibly two strong 
teams." BILL PLASCHKE

'EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS' SIDELINE CLIPPERS' SPENCER INDEFINITELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enigmatic center Elmore Spencer was placed on the injured list as a "result of 
apparent emotional and personal problems," the Clippers announced before Monday 
night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who met with team physician Tony Daly on Monday, will be sidelined 
indefinitely while undergoing treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like he's leaving a team that's 15-0," Clipper Coach Bill Fitch said 
of Spencer, who was kicked out of practice Sunday for being late. "I think we 
had a lot of patience with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper forward Harold Ellis, who grew up with Spencer in Atlanta, said he 
thought the team's 16-game season-opening losing streak contributed to 
Spencer's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who turns 25 today, spent 36 days in an Atlanta hospital in 1987 
after displaying symptoms of manic depression, which he said were triggered by 
the death of his mother, Marsha. She suffered a stroke during a phone 
conversation with a college recruiter in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer averaged 8.9 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.7 blocked shots last season 
and 6.4 points, 3.8 rebounds and one blocked shot this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Bob Martin, who missed the Clippers' first 15 games because of a 
bruised right heel, was activated. CHRIS BAKER

ARLINGTON RACECOURSE SHUT DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arlington International Racecourse, one of the nation's top thoroughbred 
tracks, will not open next year because its owner was not granted a riverboat 
casino license. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Richard Duchossois said Monday time ran out on his two-year effort to 
protect Illinois horse racing and breeding from competition from riverboat 
gambling when the Legislature adjourned last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchossois said parimutuel betting has dwindled because of competition from 
riverboats and the quality of racing is suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the track, home of the Arlington Million and 19 other graded stakes, 
faced a projected 1995 operating loss of $6 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 11 years of hard work to build world-class racing in the Chicago area, 
we are unwilling to preside over its demise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Lawrence, a spokesman for Gov. Jim Edgar, said the decision was 
detrimental to Illinois horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Duchossois was not interested in anything short of having all of his 
demands met," Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
 The track generates 4,500 jobs in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights and 
supports other jobs in related businesses elsewhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Illinois Racing Board had given Arlington 130 racing dates for 1995. Those 
dates now will go to Sportsman's Park in Cicero and Hawthorne Race Course in 
Stickney.

 Paul Wright, who shared the scoring championship of the American Professional 
Soccer League last year, was released by the Salsa because of a contract 
dispute, General Manager Rick Davis said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright had 12 goals last season and 25 in his two seasons with the Salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come to a contractual impasse where it seemed that we weren't able to 
resolve certain issues," Davis said.

ANGELS SIGN HUDLER FOR TWO YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rex Hudler, who was unemployed nine months ago and wondering if he'd ever 
return to the major leagues, signed a two-year, $600,000 contract Monday with 
the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler, the Angels' top utilityman last season, will be paid a base salary of 
$300,000 in 1995 and 1996. He also is eligible to earn an additional $100,000 
in incentives each season for reaching 300 plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe how great everything has turned out for me," said Hudler, who 
was an unrestricted free agent. "The only reason I even wanted to leave the 
Angels was so I could have a chance to go to the big dance, but the two-year 
contract made me turn my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler, who batted .298 with eight homers and 20 runs batted in in 124 at-bats 
last season, also received one-year contract offers from the Cleveland Indians, 
Chicago White Sox and Philadelphia Phillies. The Dodgers expressed interest but 
never made an offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go back to the National League, but once (hitting coach) Rod 
Carew signed back with the Angels, I changed my mind," Hudler said. "I learned 
more in a short season from Rod than I ever did in my whole career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler, 34, who was released from San Francisco and wasn't picked up until 
March 28 by the Angels, also said he has no intentions of crossing the picket 
line if replacement players are used in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe a lot to the Angels, and especially to (former Manager) Buck Rodgers 
for giving me the opportunity," Hudler said. "But there's no way I'll cross. 
They could have given me $15 million, and I still wouldn't cross." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, the Angels made some money to help pay for Hudler's contract by 
acquiring shortstop Thomas Perez in the Rule 5 draft, and selling him to the 
Toronto Blue Jays. The Angels also sold reliever Jeff Schwarz to the Japanese 
League.

ST. LOUIS BALKS AT RAMS' TICKET-SALE REQUEST; FOOTBALL: TEAM WANTS GUARANTEE OF 
55,000 TICKETS SOLD FOR EACH HOME GAME; CITY SAYS NO DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although St. Louis appears to be doing everything it can to fulfill the Rams' 
ambitious and expensive relocation wish list, the city will not satisfy at 
least one of the team's major requests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams want a guarantee of 55,000 ticket sales per game to play in the 
70,000-seat domed stadium that is being constructed in St. Louis. The city's 
response: No way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have said no, and we will continue to say no," said former U.S. Senator 
Thomas Eagleton, who is heading the city's efforts to attract the Rams, at a 
press conference Monday in St. Louis. "That is a large issue that will continue 
to be declined." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also recently requested that St. Louis consider changing seat colors 
in the new stadium to the team colors of blue and gold. Eagleton said he didn't 
know what colors the seats will be -- they are believed to be blue and red -- 
or whether they had been ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the seats have been ordered and delivered, and the Rams are not happy 
with them, it could cost millions to have them replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want their team colors -- I don't think that's being unreasonable," said 
Eagleton, who heads a group that hopes to raise at least $60 million to cover 
the Rams' anticipated moving costs. "I don't know what that would cost or if 
it's feasible." 
</P>
<P>
 The two issues are examples of why negotiations between St. Louis and the Rams 
appear to be bogged down in details, but Eagleton said they should not be 
construed as evidence that a deal is falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want everything in writing, and I don't blame them," said Eagleton, who 
denied ESPN's report Sunday that a deal had been finalized. "Every issue they 
can think of will be in the agreement. They want a state-of-the-art facility, 
and these are important things, and if you leave them open, they might think 
they're not going to get them when they get here." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton remains confident St. Louis will attract the Rams, "but it's not a 
lock," he said. "The main issues pertaining to the stadium, what's going to be 
in it, what the revenue streams will be, how it will be operated, still need to 
be resolved. But we continue to resolve matters of disagreement every week." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton is aware that a local offer to keep the Rams in Orange County has 
improved -- the Save the Rams task force is now exploring the possibility of 
building a football stadium on the Anaheim Stadium lot instead of refurbishing 
the present facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram President John Shaw told reporters in Los Angeles on Sunday that many 
details remained to be resolved with St. Louis and that no decision on a move 
would be made for "at least a couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue addressed the Ram situation before the Monday 
night game in San Diego. But he offered no new insights.

GIRLS' SOCCER 1994-1995: SOCCER PREVIEW; A TITLE WOULD MAKE ENGESSER FEEL LIKE 
PART OF THE FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kimberly Engesser is following the lead of her older siblings quite nicely at 
Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
 Christie led the Seahawks to a State cross-country title in 1992 and won a 
Southern Section track title in the 800 meters in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian, Christie's twin brother, helped Ocean View to a section title in boys' 
soccer in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Kimberly decided to attend Portland on a soccer scholarship, 
meaning that next year she will join Brian (Notre Dame) and Christie (Oregon) 
as NCAA Division I athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressive company, but Kimberly falls short in one area: high school 
championships won. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saving up for this year," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Engesser, a three-time, first-team All-Sunset League forward, will certainly 
be the key for Ocean View this season. The Seahawks have moved to the new 
Golden West League as the favorites. They also should challenge for the 
Southern Section Division II title. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Seahawks' improved chances, Engesser isn't especially happy about 
the move. She has many friends on strong Sunset League teams such as Marina and 
Huntington Beach and says she will miss the rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are playing them in the preseason, but it's not going to be the same 
thing," Engesser said. "Plus there shouldn't be that much competition in our 
new league." 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View Coach Ron Uehle said Engesser thrives in competitive games. When 
the Seahawks had to win their final four league games to qualify for the 
playoffs last season, Engesser led them to victory, scoring at least one goal 
in each game. She scored all four goals in 2-0 victories over Fountain Valley 
and Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a very unselfish player," Uehle said. "She would probably be happier to 
pass the ball off and have someone else score than score herself. But she knows 
when to step her game up." 
</P>
<P>
 Engesser has honed her game playing for her club team -- North Huntington 
Beach, which won the Southern California under-17 title last spring -- and with 
the Olympic Development Program. She made the U.S. under-16 national team last 
year and last month tried out for the under-20 team. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been coached by some of the best college coaches around," Uehle said. 
"She takes it all in and brings it back to her game." 
</P>
<P>
 But last season, her individual aspirations interfered with the Seahawks' 
season. Engesser missed Ocean View's wild-card playoff game with Glendora St. 
Lucy's because she was in Florida trying out for the under-16 national team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View lost 1-0 on an own goal with about 15 minutes left in the game. Two 
days later, St. Lucy's lost to eventual-finalist Palos Verdes Peninsula in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt bad leaving the team and missing the playoffs," Engesser said. "But I 
looked at it as a good opportunity to try out and there are always a lot of 
college coaches at these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Uehle said he was made aware of the conflict with about a month to go in the 
season and agreed with Engesser's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt it was a good thing for her," he said. "Not too many people get 
the opportunity to get into the national pool. You have to look at it in the 
long-term sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Uehle hopes some of the payoff comes in the playoffs this season. Engesser 
scored 25 goals last season, and the Seahawks will again count on her for 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Uehle also depends on Engesser for leadership. "Kim has really opened up in 
the last year," Uehle said. "She has a great sense of humor and it's coming to 
the surface now. Previously, she was always shy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year she'll be a senior and one of the captains. I know she will give a 
lot of vocal leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 With her college decision behind her, Kimberly can concentrate on her final 
season of high school soccer. Before it started last week, she had 62 goals in 
her career; she said she would like to finish with 100. 
</P>
<P>
 But she doesn't put any undue pressure on herself. She knows that many 
defenses will be focused on stopping her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really feel any pressure," Engesser said. "I just go out there and 
play and if I don't score, I don't score. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are really marking me tightly, then other people will probably be 
open." Girls' Soccer at a Glance

haven't lost in 44 league games, all in the Garden Grove League. . . . Deborah 
Hargrave, who had 28 goals and 16 assists for Fullerton last year, tore the 
anterior cruciate ligament in her knee during the summer and probably will miss 
her senior season.

'IT'S BEEN AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER'; FAMILIES: PERHAPS IT'S A MATTER OF 
NATIONAL PRIDE. BUT RUSSIA'S DECISION TO CURB ADOPTIONS TO THE WEST HAS LEFT 
POTENTIAL PARENTS IN A STATE OF TURMOIL.

 If all goes well, Katherine Elena Roderick will get parents for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 A toddler from Siberia with eyes that remind her mother-to-be of Elizabeth 
Taylor's, she could also be one of the last Russian children to be adopted by 
Americans for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although recent news stories predicting a Dec. 1 suspension of foreign 
adoptions proved incorrect, Russia is expected to enact a law that could reduce 
substantially, if not stanch for months, the stream of children who have become 
some of the former Soviet Union's most sought-after exports to the West. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 Russian children have been adopted by Americans since the 
Soviet Union crumbled in 1991; more than half of them in the year that ended 
Sept. 30, according to State Department figures. Taken together, the former 
Soviet republics have edged out South Korea as the primary foreign source for 
American adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
 For an estimated 1,000 Americans currently trying to adopt Russians -- and 
perhaps many more who have been contemplating such a step -- this is a time of 
high anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have to say it's been an emotional roller coaster," said Debby Zielinski 
of Old Forge, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband already suffered bitter disappointment when, after being 
matched with an 18-month-old boy in Crimea, the government in that 
semiautonomous region slapped a moratorium on foreign adoptions in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Zielinskis have chosen another boy, from Moscow, and have been told by 
their adoption agency to be ready to travel in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the lower house of the Russian parliament passed the adoption law Nov. 
18 (it must still pass the upper house and be signed by President Boris Yeltsin 
to take effect), American agencies have been trying to expedite cases already 
in the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying to send as many people to Russia as I possibly can," said Larisa 
Mason, head of the International Assistance Group in Pittsburgh, which has 
arranged 125 Russian adoptions and is handling more than 100 now. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula and John Roderick left Thursday on a grueling journey to an orphanage in 
Birobidzhan in Russia's remote northeast. There they hope to claim the girl to 
whose birth name, Elena, they have already added another, Katherine. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed before their departure, Paula Roderick expressed confidence that 
they would have the 14-month-old girl in their suburban Alexandria, Va., home 
for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 From the time the adoption agency showed us "one little bitty picture, a color 
Xerox of a Polaroid . . . she's been our daughter," Roderick said. "She looks 
like she has Elizabeth Taylor's eyes. Her eyes are so blue they're almost 
violet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't pick her. God did. Becoming a parent is a leap of faith to begin 
with, whether the child is biological or adoptive." 
</P>
<P>
 Faith, optimism, patience and a certain fatalism were expressed by nearly a 
dozen prospective parents interviewed as they waited in limbo for final 
approvals in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 For most, the new uncertainties of Russian adoption seemed far outweighed by 
the ordeals they had already suffered trying to conceive children or adopt in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 One California woman, who asked that her name not be used, said she wanted a 
Russian child so she could "refocus the love" she had given to a daughter who 
died of E. coli infection during the bacteria outbreak two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing in life will ever set me back so much again," she said. "If this 
adoption is meant to happen, it will happen. I can offer this (Russian) child 
so much and this child can offer us so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Of about 60,000 adoptions by Americans in the year ending in September, about 
14% (8,195) were from foreign countries, according to the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But foreign children accounted for nearly 17% of adoptions of children younger 
than 2, estimated William Pierce, president of the National Council for 
Adoption, an advocacy group based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are turning to foreign countries to avoid long waits in this 
country, opposition to interracial adoption, and the fear that biological 
parents may change their minds and demand their children back. 
</P>
<P>
 For single parents, gay couples and those older than 40, adoption agency 
officials added, a foreign adoption is often the only kind possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fall of Communism, Americans have been drawn to Russia and other 
Eastern European countries because of the numbers of white children living in 
orphanages, often in dire conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 But what looks like love and altruism from an American perspective often 
appears quite different in countries that not long ago saw themselves as equal 
in stature to the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time we identify the No. 1 country sending kids to the United States, it 
immediately becomes a matter of national disgrace for that country," Pierce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been backlashes against American adoptions in Romania, which in 
1991 sent more than 2,500 children to the United States, and in South and 
Central America. In Guatemala, villagers, outraged by rumors of baby-selling 
for organ transplants, bludgeoned a 51-year-old Alaskan woman into a coma 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing so grim has happened in Russia, but nationalistic feelings have risen, 
along with anger at the large sums of money -- up to $25,000 -- Americans are 
willing to spend to take home Russian kids. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the money goes for legitimate expenses and gifts to orphanages, 
Russian middlemen, or "facilitators" as they are known, have been caught paying 
bribes and forging documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Russian law is intended to curtail abuses by transferring 
decision-making powers from orphanage directors and local officials to a 
central agency equipped with a computer data base of all children available for 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 But with more than 200,000 children in institutions and a faltering economy, 
many wonder whether Russia can create such a system. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't even have fax machines or adequate food," said Linda Crumpecker, 
the adoptive mother of a Russian boy and the chairman of Families for Russian 
and Ukrainian Adoption, a Washington-based support group with 250 members. 
</P>
<P>
 If the law is passed, "there could be a substantial delay" in adoptions, said 
Mason, who is encouraging new clients to consider children from other former 
Soviet republics, such as Uzbekistan. "Nobody knows how the law will work 
because no structure is in place to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Pearse, director of Adoptions Together, a Baltimore, Md., agency that 
has placed more than 100 children from the former Soviet Union, said it was 
unclear whether Moscow and some other areas might be excluded from the central 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had many calls from our waiting families asking whether they should 
switch programs. We have encouraged them to hang in there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A State Department recording ((202) 647-3444) advises Americans that adoptions 
could be suspended for as long as eight months once the law is enacted. It 
cautions parents to "be sure their cases will be allowed to be processed to 
completion" before traveling to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier advisory from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow predicting a Dec. 1 
suspension of adoptions caused a furor in the adoption community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the U.S. Embassy jumped the gun in its efforts to protect families 
and caused immeasurable anxiety for thousands of people," said Linda 
Perilstein, executive director of Cradle of Hope, a Washington agency that has 
arranged 320 Russian adoptions and is currently handling 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her clients are trying to stay calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're stuck in the middle right now," said Kathy Locraft of Herndon, Va. "The 
State Department tells me one thing, the agency tells me another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps that we had to deal with the bureaucracy there and here before," 
said Locraft, who has a 5-year-old adopted from the Ukraine as well as a 
biological child of 7. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Rodericks, Katherine Elena would be their first child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 44 years old and my husband will be 50 in January," Paula Roderick said. 
"It's hard to believe after you try for so long and have so many 
disappointments and heartbreaks. You're almost afraid to hope. Then all of a 
sudden you see the picture of your child."

CONSTRUCTING CONFIDENCE; DR. ROBERT RUDER USED COWS' RIBS TO FIND A WAY TO 
CREATE HUMAN EARS FROM RIB CARTILAGE. HIS INGENUITY AND DEDICATION HAVE GIVEN 
THOSE WITH MICROTIA NEW HOPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Plastic surgeon Robert Ruder can now look back at those days at the Vons 
grocery store with a smile. At the time, however, it was a little embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, he would saunter up to the meat counter and ask the butcher for a 
bundle of leftover cows' ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought I was crazy," Ruder recalls. "I didn't want any meat on the bones. 
He didn't know how to charge me." 
</P>
<P>
 But the butcher obliged and Ruder took the ribs home to his kitchen. He worked 
on a dozen ribs. Then 50, then 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hundred cows' ribs later, Ruder was ready. He had enough practice to try 
what other pioneering surgeons had been struggling with for several decades 
without great success: build a human ear from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Ruder's innovation -- sculpting a graft of human rib cartilage to 
form an ear -- has led to a very effective procedure to correct microtia, a 
relatively common birth defect in which a small nub is formed instead of an 
ear. 
</P>
<P>
 And because only a few surgeons worldwide specialize in the laborious series 
of operations, Ruder attracts patients from around the world, many of them 
children devastated not so much by the deformity, but by how other kids view 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "At around age 5 or 6 is when the other kids start destroying them" with cruel 
teasing, says Ruder, a Beverly Hills surgeon, who has heard many sad playground 
tales. "Most of these kids have terrible (emotional) problems, and the families 
suffer. Families are often not aware that something positive can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 His patients, who now number 162, say the procedure is worthwhile, even though 
it takes many months and costs about $15,000. Insurance sometimes covers part 
of the costs, Ruder says. For families who cannot afford the surgery, Ruder 
often absorbs the costs in exchange for whatever the family offers -- 
everything from baked goods to time spent counseling and supporting other 
families who are just beginning the process. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mark Garcia, 10, was born without a left ear, his parents, Mario and 
Rosario, began a frustrating quest to see if anyone could fix the defect. After 
many dead-ends, the Lynwood family was finally referred to Ruder. Mark is about 
halfway through the multistage reconstruction. But his life has already 
changed, his mother says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is so happy," Rosario Garcia says. "He used to be at a school where the 
other kids would laugh at him. He would cry at school, and he had so many 
problems that I had to move him to a private school. He wanted so much to be 
normal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Microtia affects one out of 7,000 newborns and involves just one deformed ear 
in about seven out of 10 cases. Usually, the other ear looks and functions 
normally. The defect is sometimes inherited. The acne drug Accutane, which 
should not be taken during pregnancy because of its link to many serious birth 
defects, can cause microtia in fetuses. Sometimes the cause is simply unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 The ear begins to form in the third week of fetal development, but something 
goes wrong. The result is just a tiny nub that looks like a fleshy earlobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, however, the patient has an intact inner ear and can hear muffled 
sounds despite the fact that the outer ear is missing -- a situation not unlike 
having a baby grand with its lid shut. People with one good ear develop full 
speech and have only modest difficulty hearing. Many also learn to read lips. 
</P>
<P>
 "With microtia, the kids often hear themselves louder but they can't hear 
other people. Or they can hear, but you have to talk loudly. These people are 
often perfectly normal in every way but the ear," says Ruder, 49, who saw his 
first patient in the 1980s. The patient had undergone reconstructive surgery in 
Sweden but was unhappy with the result. Ruder wasn't sure he could help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think there was a real state-of-the-art treatment. So I started to 
do research on it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued that he might be able to reconstruct an ear and improve a patient's 
hearing, Ruder visited one doctor in Japan and another in San Francisco who had 
adopted various ways to rebuild the ear. Surgeons had tried using Silastic, a 
rubbery plastic, and had even made ears out of cartilage from the ribs of 
cadavers. But sometimes the shape did not hold up or look normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruder thought that perhaps a patient's own ribs could be used and began his 
experiments with cows' ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was what stimulated my interest -- knowing that there was an area of 
medicine that needed attention," he says. "I tried to pick up the best tips 
from each person who was doing the surgery, and it just evolved. Each procedure 
we did was better than the last." 
</P>
<P>
 He selected his first patient -- a child -- because the youngster thought any 
ear would be better than no ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a child who was psychologically devastated by his ear," the surgeon 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 The child underwent a series of four operations and many other office visits, 
Ruder says. "Then I waited 1 1/2 years to see if it lasted." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Ruder wasn't sure how well the procedure would work because grafted 
tissue is often reabsorbed. He was thrilled when that didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first stage of the surgery, a piece of rib is removed from the patient, 
is sculpted and is set in place within a pocket of skin. (That's where all that 
practice on cows' ribs came in handy, Ruder says.) Tubes are inserted to allow 
fluid to drain. That part is often the hardest on the patient because of the 
rib graft. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second operation, done in an outpatient surgical suite, the existing 
piece of ear -- the nub -- is reversed to form the earlobe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third procedure, an otolaryngologist creates an ear canal and eardrum 
to link the outer ear to the fine bones of the inner ear. The ear canal is made 
from a skin graft from the stomach or leg and the eardrum is made from a graft 
of muscle behind the ear, says Dr. Antonio Dela Cruz, an otolaryngologist and 
director of education at the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We mechanically connect the newly grafted eardrum to the bone so that outside 
vibrations can move the eardrum and receive sound," Dela Cruz says. "The bones 
are usually there but are often frozen -- they don't move -- and they need to 
be freed up using a laser." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Ruder, Dela Cruz says he finds the reconstruction one of the most 
rewarding surgeries he performs. "Especially," he says, "when it's a child who 
has the deformity in both ears." 
</P>
<P>
 Months after the surgery on the inner ear, the final operation is performed: A 
groove is made behind the otherwise flat ear. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some risks to the surgery. Some people develop large scars called 
keloids. And infections and blood clots are a risk of almost any surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the age of the patient is a concern. It's best to wait until age 8, 
when the existing ear has reached adult size and can be used for an accurate 
comparison. But, after about age 30 or so, the surgery becomes problematic 
because the rib cartilage used for the graft turns to bone, which is much 
harder to shape and riskier to graft. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ruder was opposed to performing the surgery in adults -- until he met Leah 
Hulce, who was 39 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought 39 was old -- but it is for ears," he says. "I told Leah I 
had not done anyone of that age and that the literature suggested many, many 
problems and the results were not that good." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hulce, who was born without a right ear, persuaded Ruder to take on her 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been shy about my ear," says Hulce, who lives in Redondo Beach. 
"My father gave me a real sense of 'You are OK.' It was nothing to be ashamed 
of. When I was little and kids would tease me, I would say 'That's the way God 
made me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hulce's positive attitude served her well. She learned to read lips and turn 
her head to pick up sounds with her left ear. She wore her hair up and hung a 
single earring on her left ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to sometimes think, what if I had a chance to have my ear repaired? 
But then I thought, 'Why should I?' " 
</P>
<P>
 About four years ago, however, things changed. Hulce, the mother of two, 
suddenly had trouble hearing out of her good ear. "It scared me to death 
because there was no backup." 
</P>
<P>
 At the House Ear Institute, Hulce was told that there was no obvious cause for 
the hearing loss. The doctor then recommended that Hulce have her right ear 
reconstructed -- to her amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea that this surgery was available," Hulce says. "I had been so 
busy with my life. I went back to work after this appointment and I sat there 
at my desk stunned. I knew right away that I wanted to do it. Then I cried -- 
for two hours. Obviously being able to hear is a lot more important to me than 
I had ever thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruder began reconstructing Hulce's ear in February, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was going out on a limb with me, but he realized how determined I am. He 
would tell me, 'Leah, you are going to get discouraged. You're going to want to 
quit.' But I am an extremely determined person." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruder was right in some ways. The surgery was more difficult and the ear's 
appearance was not as good as seen in younger patients. But Hulce says the 
surgery has helped her in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to have something to put my glasses on," she says of her new ear, 
which is slightly misshapen and more fleshy looking than the left ear. "And the 
reassurance is tremendous. There is not that feeling that my other ear is going 
bad and I'll be dead in the water." 
</P>
<P>
 It took about a year to develop hearing in the new ear, Hulce says. First, she 
heard a flushing toilet. Then, one day, she realized she could identify where 
the speakers were located in her car. So Hulce decided to put her new ear to 
the ultimate test. She gathered her family and some friends in her living room, 
shut her eyes and told them to move around the room and speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could point to where they were," she says. "I sat there and cried. That was 
a good day." Building an Ear 
</P>
<P>
 Making an ear takes four operations and several months. 
</P>
<P>
 * First surgery: An E-shaped piece of rib is removed from the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Piece is sculpted to resemble an ear and is inserted in a pocket of skin. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second: The fatty remnant of the ear, which patients often call the nub, is 
transposed to a lobe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Third: Otolatryngologists form an ear canal as a link to inner ear. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fourth: A groove is made behind the ear using grafts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After completion of the surgery, it can take 12 to 18 months for hearing to 
develop.

 In 1980, after Portuguese runner Rosa Mota had been competing successfully for 
half a dozen years, something went inexplicably wrong. In races where she 
should have been finishing among the top three, she began placing 12th or 13th. 
Her legs felt dead. She just couldn't get them to move. 
</P>
<P>
 She went to doctors, but they couldn't figure it out. They told her it was 
psychological. They told her she was too old (she was 21) and past her prime 
and should quit racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Pedrosa, her coach and companion, who was fresh out of medical school, 
had his own theory. He thought her difficulties might be respiratory related, 
even though she wasn't having any obvious breathing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned out to be right: She had suddenly developed exercise-induced asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, asthma is a disease characterized by a reversible obstruction -- a 
temporary blockage -- of the bronchial airways, the tubes through which people 
breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 The blockage results from inflammation and mucus in the airways, the 
contraction of the muscles that surround the airways and airway swelling. In 
most cases, it is triggered by any number of things, including irritants such 
as tobacco smoke, a cold, allergens (pollen, dust, animal dander) or certain 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
 When exercise is the catalyst, it is called exercise-induced asthma, or 
exercise-induced bronchospasm. It is a most peculiar affliction, where the 
symptoms can either be subtle, as they were with Mota, or very obvious. When 
symptoms are apparent, they typically strike after three to eight minutes of 
strenuous exercise: chest tightness, coughing, shortness of breath, even dry 
throat, stomachache and headache. It can last for up to 15 or 20 minutes, and 
it can affect athletic performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was diagnosed just after the 1988 Olympic trials," says U.S. marathoner Kim 
Jones. "I was running and just couldn't race. I couldn't take a deep breath, 
and I was wheezing. It was a terrible claustrophobic feeling. I actually 
panicked." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not a new phenomenon. Several centuries ago, physicians were writing 
about the effect of exercise on breathing. Modern medical literature described 
exercise-induced asthma in adults at least 50 years ago, and it has been about 
30 years since experts reported similar symptoms in children. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been only in recent years that the condition has begun to attract 
increasing attention -- in part because so many well-known athletes have 
developed it or have begun to speak about it. 
</P>
<P>
 They include marathoners like Jones and Mota -- who went on to win the 1987 
world track and field championships marathon, two Boston marathons and the 1988 
Olympic race. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Janis Klecker, a member of the 1992 Olympic team, and Joan Benoit 
Samuelson, who in 1984 won the first Olympic women's marathon in Los Angeles; 
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who earned a silver medal in the 1984 Games, two gold 
medals in the 1988 Games, a gold in the 1992 Games, and won the long jump and 
heptathlon in the 1987 world championships. Others include swimmer Nancy 
Hogshead and basketball player Danny Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, 11% of the athletes who competed in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles 
had some form of exercise-induced asthma, and 1988 Olympic athletes with the 
condition included five gold medalists, 10 silver medalists and one bronze 
medalist. 
</P>
<P>
 But exercise-induced asthma can strike anyone and can begin at any age, just 
like regular asthma. The American Academy of Allergy and Immunology has 
estimated that up to 15% of the population suffers from exercise-induced 
asthma, including at least 40% of those with hay fever-type allergies and up to 
95% of individuals who already have regular asthma. An estimated 12 million 
Americans have asthma, and more than 22 million suffer from allergic rhinitis 
(hay fever.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Exercise is one of the most common precipitants of acute asthma seen in 
clinical practice," says Dr. Gary S. Rachelefsky, director of the Allergy 
Research Foundation and a clinical professor of pediatrics at the UCLA School 
of Medicine. "This occurs in people of all ages, although it is more common in 
children because of their increased physical activity." 
</P>
<P>
 It typically occurs when airway obstruction increases after three to eight 
minutes of a vigorous workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have increasing symptoms over the next five to 10 minutes, and then 
it goes away . . . usually within an hour," Rachelefsky says. Occasionally, 
however, "it can become serious and lead to hospitalization." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Experts believe the attack occurs because exercise often involves breathing 
through the mouth, which introduces cool, dry air. During exercise, the person 
hyperventilates by taking rapid, shallow breaths. Hyperventilation cools the 
airways. A reflex reaction to the cooling of the airways can trigger an asthma 
attack. (Breathing through the nose, on the other hand, helps warm and humidify 
the air before it reaches the bronchial tubes.) 
</P>
<P>
 The condition seems to be at its worst when the weather is cold and dry. Not 
surprisingly, runners, cyclists, ice skaters and cross-country skiers suffer 
more than swimmers, who are inhaling moist air from just above the waterline. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise-induced asthma can be very subtle, as it was with Mota -- with some 
people not even being aware of it, except in their performance -- or it can be 
quite severe, as it was with Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a variant of asthma, but some people don't even consider asthma,' says 
Dr. David Tinkelman, an Atlanta allergist who has studied exercise-induced 
asthma in high-performance Olympic marathon and 10,000-meter runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say: 'I'm in great shape. I don't have a problem. Just this tightness 
when I run,' " Tinkelman adds. "Well it does exist, but it can exist without 
people being aware of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tinkelman studied elite athletes to see whether long-term use of 
anti-inflammatory agents -- which attack the underlying inflammation of the 
airways -- can alleviate the problem and, as a result, enhance performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of these drugs, known as inhaled corticosteroids, is often standard asthma 
therapy but is not routinely used to treat the exercise-induced kind. "Yes, it 
did help high-level athletes," he says, adding most of them improved their 
performance times using the therapy -- although he says he wouldn't recommend 
the regimen for average or recreational athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are established ways of preventing exercise-induced asthma through 
medication and other means, experts say. Athletes who suffer from the condition 
are usually encouraged to exercise in warm, humid air, or to take up water 
sports. If this is not possible, it helps to use a scarf or face mask when 
working out in cold, dry weather. This allows the athlete to breathe air that 
has been warmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the condition can subside for two to three hours after an initial 
episode, elite athletes, such as Joyner-Kersee, routinely provoke an attack 
through wind sprints or another vigorous warm-up right before competition so 
they will not be hampered during the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have it a little bit, and then it goes away for an hour or more," 
Rachelefsky says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many athletes with the condition also routinely use inhaled medications known 
as bronchodilators before exercise. These include beta-2 agonists, cromolyn 
sodium or both. These drugs provide symptomatic relief and thus far are not 
among those substances banned in international competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachelefsky adds that if someone is in the middle of a marathon or another 
event, it is often wise just to keep going when an attack hits -- run through 
it -- because it will almost always go away.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you stop, it can get worse, so don't stop," he says. "Sometimes that's 
hard to do, but it works." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the approach Jones takes when she runs a marathon -- a 26.2-mile event 
that the world's swiftest women typically complete in less than 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do go out fairly hard and I go through a mild attack," she says. "Then I 
back off, but keep running. Then I take off after I'm breathing efficiently 
again. I've learned to adapt."

HEALTH WATCH: BODY WATCH; SAVE TIME AND HELP A CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 We found a nifty way to reduce some tension from the holiday hullabaloo and at 
the same time help out some kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works:  
</P>
<P>
 * The Venice Family Clinic will handle your entire Christmas card list. Cards 
are $5 apiece with a three-day turnaround. Otherwise, the cards, some made by 
children, go for $2 with a greeting inside and $1.50 for the blank ones. Inside 
the greeting can be personalized or it can say, "In the spirit of the season 
when we think of those in need, a contribution has been made in your name to 
the Venice Family Clinic by . . ." The Family Clinic folks will address the 
envelope, stuff, stamp and mail it. Poof! Your Christmas list is done. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have a hard-to-buy-for Scrooge type on your list, you can sponsor a 
child for $25 during the holiday and the clinic will send the acknowledgment as 
a Christmas gift to anyone you choose. Funds treat more than 1,000 children to 
a holiday movie, popcorn, a visit from Santa and presents, and your donation 
takes care of one child's complete immunization plus certain health-care needs 
for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call the Venice Family Clinic at (310) 392-8630, Ext. 345. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cards also have been drawn by HIV-positive children in the Caring Strokes 
Program at the Comprehensive Maternal Child HIV Management and Research Center, 
at County-USC Medical Center. The blank cards are $1 apiece and there's a small 
fee (depending on the number of cards purchased) for your personal imprint. 
Call (213) 931-5703 or (213) 342-3732 to order. Stop Carbon Monoxide Poisoning 
</P>
<P>
 Carbon monoxide causes nearly 680 deaths per year. Symptoms may be hard to 
recognize because they mimic flu and other common diseases, says Robert J. 
Geller, pediatric toxicologist at Egleston Children's Hospital at Emory 
University. Headaches, drowsiness, nausea, dizzy spells and confusion may 
indicate low-level poisoning. Geller offers advice to prevent carbon monoxide 
poisoning: 
</P>
<P>
 * Have gas heating and hot water systems checked yearly. Never use a gas 
heating system that shows signs of problems, such as a yellow, unsteady, or 
smoky flame. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't use ranges, ovens or charcoal grills as sources of heat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give gas heaters a source of fresh air, such as a slightly opened window. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide ventilation indoors when using a wood stove or fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintain car exhaust system and never run gas-powered machinery or cars in 
garages or other enclosed buildings. Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount University and Saint John's Hospital in Santa Monica have 
established a Bioethics Institute to educate health care professionals on 
ethical, legal, political and social issues in medicine . . . The American 
School Health Assn. recommends adolescents and young adults vaccinate against 
hepatitis B as 75% of those affected are between 15 and 39.

FIRST PERSON: BODY WATCH; LEARNING TO RIDE A BIKE BRINGS A NEW BALANCE TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILA COBO-HANLON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Go, Curly, go!" shouts Arthur, huffing and puffing as he runs to keep up with 
me. I furiously pedal for my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, I'm barely touching you now," he pants. "I'm going to let go . . . you're 
on your own!" 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly I no longer feel the slight steadying pressure of his hand. He's 
still running beside me, but he's waving his arms up and down excitedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing it, I'm doing it!" I cry. For the first time in my life I am riding 
a bike, alone, unaided and sans training wheels, thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
 Two seconds later, a fence gets in my way. 
</P>
<P>
 I clutch at it desperately as I lose my balance and the bike crashes to the 
ground. But I don't care. I am ecstatic. I've learned to ride a bike. 
</P>
<P>
 The same scene replays itself day after day throughout the world. Child wants 
to learn to ride a bike. Mom, Dad, sister or brother offers to teach child, and 
runs up and down like a maniac with said child. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the "child" is a tad old, and the person running alongside isn't 
my dad. It's my husband. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no big secret behind my then-inability to ride. When I was a child -- 
the youngest on the block -- all the other kids' bikes were too big for me. So 
I learned to roller-skate instead. By the time I realized I was a loser for not 
being able to get on a bicycle, it was too late. But the fact is, as you get 
older, learning to ride a bike, as with everything else, just gets harder and 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
 At 15, I was ashamed to try to get on a two-wheeler. By 20, I was bigger and 
even more embarrassed. At 29, my life changed. 
</P>
<P>
 I was having lunch with my friend Teresa, who asked if I wanted to go bike 
riding that weekend. I looked around and lowered my voice. "I can't ride," I 
muttered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I couldn't ride either," she said nonchalantly, adding that her husband 
had taught her. 
</P>
<P>
 My jaw dropped. I wasn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked at Teresa, half admiringly, half enviously. Here she was, older than 
I and not nearly as much of a fitness freak, and she could ride up and down the 
California coast on her bike. 
</P>
<P>
 I started brooding. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never taught me how to ride a bike," I said to my husband accusingly. "I 
live in California and you haven't taught me. How could you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Arthur. He lived with this litany for about six months, until my birthday 
came around. 
</P>
<P>
 I got home from work, opened the door and there it was: a blue bicycle with a 
pink ribbon. It was some kind of mountain contraption with about 20 gears that 
I still don't know what to do with. Wrapped around the handle bars were a blue 
helmet and red gloves. It was beautiful. It was formidable. I tried balancing 
on it, but couldn't. (Later on, I was told balancing a still bike is nearly 
impossible, but how was I to know?) 
</P>
<P>
 It took me three months to get up my nerve and actually try to ride. One 
Saturday we went to the huge DMV parking lot in Santa Monica. No one was there 
except for an older woman learning to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 As I struggled to maintain my balance, Arthur running beside me, the older 
woman went around in slow circles with someone directing her from the passenger 
seat. I tried making eye contact in an attempt at mutual support, but she 
wouldn't look at me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relax, relax!" screamed Arthur. "You look like a board, you look like you're 
going to have a heart attack. Loosen your arms, you're just sitting there, you 
have to balance, you have to pedal, I can't push you!" 
</P>
<P>
 I was terrified. What if I fell? 
</P>
<P>
 I finally got my balance around the same time the driving student started 
putting her car in reverse. I crashed the first of many times into a fence. She 
just put her foot on the brake. 
</P>
<P>
 But no silly crash was going to stop me now.  
</P>
<P>
 I scrambled to my feet, waved Arthur away, pushed off and managed to wobble 
for about five feet before losing my balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you see that, did you see that?" I cried in delight. I pushed again, 
managing to go a little bit further every time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relax, relax, balance, balance," I told myself as I zigzagged precariously. 
About five minutes later it started to feel good. 
</P>
<P>
 I was really getting into it when I saw the lot's other user approaching in 
her car. She didn't know how to drive, I thought uneasily. What if she ran me 
over? She must have been about 30 feet away. Too close. I panicked and fell 
hard on my knee. 
</P>
<P>
 It hurt, and for a moment I felt 5 years old again, coming home in tears with 
skinned knees after school. I got up shakily and saw that I was, indeed, 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to stop?" Arthur asked. 
</P>
<P>
 No way. I might have lost the battle, but I sure wasn't going to loose the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 I flexed my knee, pushed hard and pedaled, wobbling at first then steadier and 
steadier until I reached the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes!" I shouted, glaring at the driver who was still struggling with her car. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Sunday, we went riding again and, yes, it's true: You can teach an 
old dog new tricks.

DOWNTIME: BODY WATCH; NOTHING BEATS A PRIVATE MOMENT WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What pleases me most is curling up with my husband -- lying quietly and 
listening to our hearts beat in unison. We're getting grayer, our centers of 
gravity have shifted and we see more doctors, but we still know how to spend 
downtime together. Luckily, his favorite way is the same as mine -- wrapped in 
each other's arms and whispering that we will love each other forever . . . and 
one more day.

BASKETBALL PREVIEW; THE CREAM OF THE CROP; GIRLS: THE THREE-POINT SHOT 
REVOLUTIONIZED THE GAME, AND THESE THREESOMES WILL BE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN 
THE COUNTY THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The three-point shot is the weapon. The weapon. Shoot a three and a team can 
make up plenty of ground in a hurry. Or blow a team out. It's going on 8 years 
old, and girls who are now on varsity teams have been shooting it most of their 
basketball lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooters have never been better, and the good players are getting younger and 
younger. Freshmen can contribute right away because they can drill it from 
outside. Teams are designing plays for it. It's great. And it's here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 So to honor the trey, we're doing nothing but shooting threes. 
</P>
<P>
 Three players who can drill the three: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dyanna Hatch, Trabuco Hills, played last year for a bad team but had the 
highest three-point shooting percentage (48%) of any returning player averaging 
at least two attempts per game. 
</P>
<P>
 * Michelle Miyake, Villa Park, buried 53 three-pointers, shot 43% from the arc 
and averaged 14.9 points. Bad news: out three-to-four weeks with an ankle 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jenny Jennings, Newport Harbor, made 42% from three-point range last season 
at Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Three best shooters: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lee Moulin, Brea-Olinda, made 24 of her first 25 free throws (and 28 of 32), 
shot 39% from three-point range during the regular season and 53.3% in 33 games 
-- mostly from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shandy Robbins, Marina: Though renown as a post player, she can shoot the 
three-pointer with the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Melanie Pearson, Woodbridge, has the bulk to drive and a shooting touch to 
die for. 
</P>
<P>
 Three top backcourts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Woodbridge: Erin Stovall and Tami Weaver can take care of the ball and 
handle most opposing guards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mater Dei: Melody Peterson, Rhonda Gondringer and Allison Luckey are adept 
at creating opportunities and can burn teams deep. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brea: Kiyoko Miller and Jennifer Saari are quick, defensive-minded 
playmakers who can shoot the three-pointer and make a clutch basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Three top frontcourts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Marina: Shandy Robbins (6-1), Kirsten Cappel (6-3) and Sonya Bryant (5-10) 
are capable of destroying teams; they are athletic, can shoot from 15-feet in, 
and can fight for a rebound.  
</P>
<P>
 * Woodbridge: Angela Burgess (6-4) and Pearson (6-1) are a handful; Burgess 
might be the county's most intimidating player and Pearson can do almost 
whatever she wants with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 * Newport Harbor: Melissa Schutz (5-11), Dianne Pulido (5-10) and Tina Bowman 
(5-10) are as athletic as any girls in the county; Schutz and Bowman provide 
the spring, and Pulido the bulk. 
</P>
<P>
 Three players who can dominate a game: 
</P>
<P>
 * Marie Philman, Edison, scored 40 or more points four times last season, and 
30 or more points 10 times. If she wants it, she can take it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Melody Peterson, Mater Dei, can turn a game around with her defense, she can 
shoot from anywhere on the floor and her athleticism can stir fans into a 
frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Melanie Pearson, Woodbridge, is on a team that won't need her to dominate a 
game, but she can step up and take over when she must. 
</P>
<P>
 Three players on the spot: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jennifer Garrett, Capistrano Valley, had a disappointing season last year 
while struggling to deal with the death of her father; still, she averaged 14.8 
points and 9.6 rebounds through the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Erin Stovall, Woodbridge, had a great freshman year during Woodbridge's run 
to the State final, but she was a complementary player to guard Jamie Oenning; 
Oenning's gone, and now Stovall must do more of it on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 * Melody Peterson, Mater Dei, makes the Monarchs an elite team; without her, 
they get average in a hurry. But she must show some maturity in this, her 
junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Three more players on the spot: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shandy Robbins, Marina: This is the year that Marina might finally be able 
to get past the traditional Division I powers, and no matter how much talent 
surrounds her, the focal point of the Vikings will still be Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raschelle Lawrence, University: She led the influx of new talent to 
University, and the expectations within the program rose with her arrival from 
San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dawn Metz, Brea: Teammates Kiyoko Miller and Lee Moulin are the leaders, but 
the 6-1 Metz is the Ladycats' big girl; she must establish herself if Brea is 
to continue its great run. 
</P>
<P>
 Three coaches to watch: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jeff Sink, Brea, inherits a program with a 54-game winning streak. At 
Fairbanks (Alaska) Lathrop he won two state titles and went to seven 
consecutive state final fours. "But it wasn't Southern California basketball," 
Sink said. "In my mind, I haven't done anything yet." 
</P>
<P>
 * Eric Bangs, Woodbridge, is in the same spot as John Hattrup was last season 
at Brea. Hattrup controlled the talent and Brea lived up to the community's 
lofty expectations, winning a national championship; Bangs has all the talent, 
will open the season at No. 1 in Orange County and the community has lofty 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dave White, Edison, returns after a seven-year hiatus. He was 142-49 his 
first go-round, and now inherits one of the county's best players, Marie 
Philman. 
</P>
<P>
 Three freshmen who will make an impact: 
</P>
<P>
 * Elizabeth Fleming, Capistrano Valley, a 5-9 forward who is going to get the 
ball -- often. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monique Mathews, University, a 5-10 forward who shoots great and has the 
moves to match. 
</P>
<P>
 * Natalie Nakase, Marina, a quick 5-2 guard who can handle the ball and shoot 
the three. 
</P>
<P>
 Three transfers who will make a difference: 
</P>
<P>
 * Kirsten Cappel, a 6-2 junior forward who moved from Connelly to Marina. 
Cappel was the Academy League MVP last year, and her arrival at Marina gives 
the Vikings something akin to the Jessica Eggleston-Julie Adams tandem last 
year at Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 * Krissy Duperron, a 5-10 forward from Riverside Notre Dame to Woodbridge. 
Duperron comes from a Division V school, but averaged 23 points; she is strong 
physically and has a knack for putting the ball in the basket, but has never 
played in a big program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rhonda Gondringer, a 5-10 junior from La Quinta to Mater Dei. Her departure 
from La Quinta makes a difference there, but her addition to the Monarchs helps 
take some pressure off Melody Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Three teams on the rise: 
</P>
<P>
 * University got an influx of new blood into the program and, in the Pacific 
Coast League, will have one of the county's best records. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trabuco Hills was the county's most improved team from the first day of the 
season to the last in 1993-94; if the Mustangs show the same growth, they could 
be a factor in the South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 * Westminster now has the guards to complement its inside game. Program was 
1-99 before Coach Dick Katz arrived; those days are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Three teams to fear in 1995-96 (besides Woodbridge and Brea-Olinda): 
</P>
<P>
 * Fountain Valley: Nicole Strange and Jen Ludwicki will be seniors, giving the 
Barons two of the county's top-scoring players. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Clemente: The Tritons lose only one player who will see considerable 
playing time, and the program has junior varsity players who could probably 
play on many varsity teams. 
</P>
<P>
 * University: The Trojans should be quick and talented with a sophomore 
nucleus that will have a year under its belt. The Top 10 
</P>
<P>
 1. Woodbridge 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors lost only one player from last year's State finalist team, and 
have three of the county's best players in senior Angela Burgess, junior 
Melanie Pearson and sophomore Erin Stovall. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Brea-Olinda 
</P>
<P>
 The program is too strong to dissolve in one year, and too talented not to be 
respected with the return of Lee Moulin, Kiyoko Miller and Jennifer Saari from 
last year's national champion. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Mater Dei 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs have some of the best guards in the county, including its most 
physically gifted basketball player, Melody Peterson, and its most notable 
transfer, Rhonda Gondringer. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Marina 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings match up to Woodbridge better than any team in the county, and 
with a frontcourt of Shandy Robbins (6-1), Kirsten Cappel (6-2) and Sonya 
Bryant (5-10), No. 4 might be too low. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 With another year of maturity, juniors Nicole Strange and Jennifer Ludwicki 
are likely to prevent a repeat of last year's late-season fall, but they'll 
need help in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Newport Harbor 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Shannon Jakosky will outcoach most, and the Sailors aren't that 
different from last year -- and they were very good -- with the arrival of 
transfers Jenny Jennings and Andree Verhulst. 
</P>
<P>
 7. El Dorado 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Hawks return everyone, including Shanna Renken -- and then some -- 
from a 19-8 team that learned what it had to do to compete against the South 
County schools. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Edison 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Philman probably will lead the county in scoring, and this year she is 
surrounded by enough athletes to provide some help, making the Chargers more 
than one-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Esperanza 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs have height, strength and quickness, and are plenty athletic -- 
which is good enough to beat most teams. Their downfall is that three Sunset 
League teams are above them. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Troy 
</P>
<P>
 Jennie Gadd (6-3, center) and two other starters return from a 20-6 team with 
lofty playoff expectations, but the Warriors would be better prepared with a 
tougher nonleague schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Others to watch: Canyon, Estancia, Ocean View, University, Westminster.

BASKETBALL PREVIEW; THE CREAM OF THE CROP; BOYS: AFTER MATER DEI, THERE ARE 
STILL PLENTY OF TALENTED BASKETBALL PLAYERS TO GO AROUND IN ORANGE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER and MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking for world-beaters, or is there a high school basketball team outthere 
that can defeat Mater Dei? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's still plenty of talent running around, from San Clemente to La 
Habra and all parts in between. 
</P>
<P>
 From the top . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is it March yet? A season ago, Mater Dei lost to Los Angeles Crenshaw in the 
Southern California Division I Regional final. Getting back won't be easy, but 
it's certainly doable. The talent is there. 
</P>
<P>
 Back is 6-foot-5 sophomore Schea Cotton, who many believe may be the nation's 
top recruit two years from now. He can score inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
 Back is 6-7 senior Shaun Jackson, who has signed with Wyoming. He's a powerful 
inside player who can dominate. 
</P>
<P>
 Back is 6-2 senior Clay McKnight, who isn't out there because he's the coach's 
son. He's deadly from outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the make-or-break personnel. Can sophomore point guard Kevin 
Augustine run the show? Can 6-8 center Mike Vukovich take pressure off Jackson? 
Can the Monarchs survive what should be another brutal year in the state 
playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Gary McKnight is taking no chances with the last question. He's beefed 
up the Monarchs' nonleague schedule. They will play in the Reebok Holiday 
Classic in Las Vegas, which features 50 top high school teams from across the 
country, and the always-tough Above the Rim tournament in San Diego, as well as 
the local Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Any lessons learned should remain intact during their annual 10-0 romp through 
the South Coast league. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Give us your tired . . . : Santa Ana Valley, that home for nomadic high school 
basketball players, got close last season, losing to La Crescenta Crescenta 
Valley in the Division I-AA semifinals. The Falcons picked up a couple players 
this season and could be there again. 
</P>
<P>
 Olujimi Mann, among the top point guards in the county, returns. He 
transferred from Mater Dei last season and made the Falcons a power. This 
year's transfers, Ike Harmon (Century), a 6-7 forward, and Virgil Forbin 
(Loara), a 6-3 forward, could help Santa Ana Valley take it a step further. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rich Prospero toughened up the Falcons' schedule with Tustin, Sonora and 
Crenshaw. The Falcons also will travel to the Raleigh (N.C.) Observer 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Season won't be a drag: Mark Seaton and David Downs are Servite's team leaders 
on the court, and although they are a bit reserved and quiet, Friar Coach Scott 
Hamilton said they are dangerously funny. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come off very businesslike," Hamilton said. "But especially David, he 
has a real dry sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Take this summer, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 On a trip to Santa Barbara, after the basketball was done, the players decided 
to do a little shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to go to this thrift shop and some of the guys dressed up in all 
of these old '70s clothes," Hamilton said. "But David dressed up like a woman. 
He kind of looked like Larry Johnson's grandmama." 
</P>
<P>
 And Hamilton hopes Downs will play like her too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Big feet: The 6-9 Seaton, who has signed with Stanford, may be the best of the 
plethora of neck-craners around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora's 7-0 senior Craig Clark, who is headed to San Jose State, Woodbridge's 
6-9 sophomore Chris Burgess, Katella's 6-8 Mike Pahl and Chenowith are also 
head and shoulders above the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And here's the pitch . . . : Think Burgess is an impressive sight on the 
court? How about on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess, who transferred from Mater Dei, also is a pitcher for Woodbridge and 
has some very big advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I imagine he's a little scary to hit against," Woodbridge basketball Coach 
John Halagan said. "How would you like to have that tumbling off the mound at 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, those things don't really concern Halagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could care less if he's got a good hook or fastball," Halagan said. "I just 
want him to scare opponents on the basketball court." 
</P>
<P>
 That won't be difficult. Burgess is more than just your slam-'n'-jam type. He 
has a soft touch and can handle the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, he was amazing the moment he walked into our gym," Halagan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Comeback kid: Fountain Valley Coach Gordon Billingsley was excited to see Mike 
Arvesen back on the court. Arvesen, a senior, saw significant playing time when 
he was a sophomore. But this season will be the first time he has played in 1 
1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Arvesen underwent knee surgery to repair a ruptured anterior cruciate 
ligament, but that wasn't all that was wrong. Billingsley said Arvesen also had 
a heart arrhythmia, from an enlarged heart condition he suffered as a result of 
a viral infection. 
</P>
<P>
 But Billingsley said doctors have given Arvesen the green light to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad he's back," Billingsley said of his sharp-shooting guard. "He's 
a neat kid and I'm hoping he has a great year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fertile ground: Tustin Coach Andy Ground and the Tillers won't be wearing Doug 
Gottlieb thin this season. 
</P>
<P>
 There were times, a season ago, when the Notre Dame-bound Gottlieb was 
wandering in the wilderness. In other words, his supporting cast was stiff as 
pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so this season. With four starters returning, plus the coming of guard 
Robert Griffith, Gottlieb won't lack for people who can pad his assist numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played 55 games during the summer; that's two seasons," Ground said. "That 
matured some of these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith, a 6-1 guard, averaged 24 points on the junior varsity. David 
Lalazarian, a 6-7 center, has made tremendous improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doug has some options this year," Ground said. "He doesn't have to score as 
much. Even if Doug is having an off-night, we'll be OK. We couldn't survive 
that last year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Are they going forward or backward? OK, so one La Quinta basketball player 
just gets a little confused. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs were getting ready to play the faculty last week, an exhibition in 
which they would display their new uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jim Perry was checking to see that everyone had a proper fit when he 
approached one player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Coach, look, the drawstring is broken.' " Perry said. "I looked and 
told him, 'Son, you have your pants on backward.' And this was a senior." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. The Aztecs are at least pointed in the right direction. They are 
favored to win the Garden Grove League. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 1998-99 All -- Orange County team? Saia Makakaufaki (6-3, Laguna Hills), 
Eric Palmer (5-7, University), Ryan Lee (5-10, Pacifica), Semaj Johnson (6-1, 
San Clemente) and Andy Gaulden (6-4, Esperanza) are freshmen who will see 
significant playing time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 And the 1998-99 player of the year? El Toro freshman Mark Wulfemeyer Jr., a 
5-11 guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he has only an ounce of his dad's talent, he's going to be pretty darn 
good. Dad, Mark Wulfemeyer Sr., is considered the best to have played in the 
county and still holds the county career scoring record (2,608 points). 
</P>
<P>
 But let's let Mark Jr. blaze his own trail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You do the math: Laguna Beach's Bret Fleming on his team's tough nonleague 
schedule, which features games against Santa Ana Valley, Orange and Mission 
Viejo. The Artists could also play Woodbridge, Lakewood and Servite in 
tournaments: 
</P>
<P>
 "If we aren't able to go .500, the kids might be questioning themselves a 
little. But if we go .500, they'll be thinking they can play with anybody. And 
if we're able to go over .500, say .750 or something, I think we'll be one of 
the top 15 teams in the county." * 
</P>
<P>
 Got a slingshot handy? Calvary Chapel Coach Craig Falconer wanted to test his 
team, so he went right to the top. The Eagles will play Mater Dei on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Calvary Chapel, a private school with about 400 students, should be good, 
with three returning starters, plus Nate Morton, a 6-5 forward. But Mater Dei? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some good teams in our playoff division, like (Gardena) Serra and 
(L.A.) Verbum Dei," Falconer said. "I wanted us to be prepared when we got to 
the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mater Dei? 
</P>
<P>
 "What good would it do us to play a weak schedule and go 16-0?" Falconer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this won't exactly be new territory for some of his players. Many 
have gone against Mater Dei players in traveling team games. In fact, 
Falconer's son, Kevin, a 6-0 point guard, has played against Monarch point 
guard Augustine on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mater Dei? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whew! The Mater Dei fate could have fallen on little St. Margaret's. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Bauer, the Tartans' former coach, expressed some interest in playing the 
Monarchs. Bauer and McKnight were classmates at San Clemente High School. But 
Bauer left before cutting the deal, fortunately for new Coach Garrett Ohara. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tartans are talented, especially guard Damian Raibon, who has signed with 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mater Dei? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Game of the year: Santa Ana Valley vs. Mater Dei, Southern California Division 
I Regional Final. The Top 10 
</P>
<P>
 1. Mater Dei 
</P>
<P>
 Typical Monarch nightmare. Size and ability. Veteran squad with one of the 
best sophomores in the nation in Schea Cotton. A meaty schedule should toughen 
them for playoff run. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Santa Ana Valley 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons reached the Division I-AA final. The return of Olujimi Mann and 
the addition of transfer Ike Harmon will make them a title contender. They're 
just a notch below No. 1 Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone is back from last season's team, which lost to Compton 
Dominguez in the II-A semifinals. Doug Gottlieb and Co. could get another crack 
at the Dons down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Servite 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Seaton and David Downs are a solid 1-2 punch. If sophomore Peter 
Martinelli develops at guard, the Friars will challenge Tustin for the league 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Sonora 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Clark, a 7-foot senior, keeps improving and the Raiders have everyone 
back. They lost to Santa Margarita a year ago in III-AA semifinals, but are 
ready to take it further. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Katella 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Tom Danley, 514 victories and counting, has one of his best teams. He 
has Mike Pahl, a 6-8 center, and LaByron Clayton, a 6-5 forward, inside and 
guard Carlos Romero outside. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs move to the South Coast League, where everyone competes to finish 
second to Mater Dei. They have the best shot with guards Rob Warnick, Laquent 
Fobbs and Nick Punto back. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins return two starters, but Jeremy Vandervoet, a 6-7 center, and 
point guard Ali Ton make them tough. They move from the Empire to Sunset 
League, but still should be champions. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Woodbridge 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Burgess, a 6-9 center, transferred from Mater Dei and the Warriors were 
instant Sea View League contenders. This is not a one-man show, with Eric 
Ripley and Todd Semm back. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons, Sunset League champions last season, have another solid no-star 
team. Center Phil Domingo and guard Dan Keller return and Paul Tayyar 
transferred from Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Others to Watch: Calvary Chapel, Cypress, La Quinta, Pacifica, St. Margaret's, 
Santa Margarita.

<P>
 It's Angelus League wars and remembrance week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat vs. Mater Dei? Servite in its first title game since 1983? Ah, 
that all-parochial, all-intense, all-or-nothing spirit rages on long after the 
league's 1992 funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Why St. Paul Coach Marijon Ancich should be enlisted to perform the coin toss 
for Saturday's Amat-Dei Division I final. Of course, someone would have to make 
sure we got the coin back. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a Pat Haden-J.K. McKay pregame show, "From Football Players To 
Lawyers: The De-Evolution Of Man." And don't forget the Mater Dei band's own 
rendition of the Servite "hut drill" at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The league is gone, disbanded in 1992, but its teams refuse to go away. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Division I title game might not draw 30,000 to Anaheim Stadium, but a 
few folks will wander in. These are old wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei lost eight consecutive games in the series, until the Monarchs went 
to Bishop Amat and slapped the Lancers silly in 1991. It was the last time the 
teams played. But that was ages ago. Surely all's forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
 An Angelus League football game, even when there's no Angelus League, has a 
certain edge to it. Anything could happen in that league and usually did. Why, 
former Bishop Amat Coach Phil Cantwell once faked a pregame heart attack to 
unnerve Ancich, his former assistant. It worked and Amat won. 
</P>
<P>
 * If Anaheim Stadium officials thought Raider fans were a handful, wait till 
they get a gander at an honest-to-goodness Angelus League blood feud. Fellas, 
better beef up the security again. These folks are serious about football. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, Ancich once proposed that the league eliminate baseball. Why? It 
interfered with spring football. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't laugh, the vote was close. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rod Perry getting beat deep? Nope, not the Monarch sophomore. Fifteen years 
ago, dad let John Stallworth slip behind him for a long touchdown pass, a key 
play in the Pittsburgh Steelers' 31-19 victory in the 1980 Super Bowl. The Rams 
have never been back to the Super Bowl. Well, Junior didn't get beat deep in 
the semifinals and the Monarchs are back in the Division I title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the field will be running back Daylon McCutcheon, who carries the load 
for the Lancers. His Dad, Lawrence, was far too beat up from being overworked 
to be much of a factor as a runner in that Ram Super Bowl. He did, though, toss 
a touchdown pass to put the Rams ahead in the third quarter. His sun set, now 
his son is on the rise. Watch out for that halfback pass. Dad passed on every 
other skill. 
</P>
<P>
 * Servite Lite? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Friars have upheld some Angelus League tradition themselves. 
That hut-drill-team will play Newport Harbor Friday in the Division V final. 
</P>
<P>
 These are tranquil days on La Palma Avenue. A few years back, people talked 
about Friar football with the same disdain they had for other private school 
powers. Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the line the Friars got respectable, at least in some eyes. 
Public school folks don't seem to see red when Servite football is mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the fact the Friars had a few down years might have something to do 
with it. Still, they're winning again and no one seems miffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, this all happened about the time Larry Toner was hired as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Come one, come all to the Public School Division I football championship. 
Los Alamitos vs. Trabuco Hills. Let's hold it Friday afternoon in Mile Square 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 They lost to those parochial cousins, but, heck, let's call the Griffins and 
Mustangs back for an encore. They're loads of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the Prep Playoff Bowl.

FIXATIONS / ORANGE COUNTY: FAN-OMATIC OF A FUTURE BYPASSED; IN HIS 
RETROACTIVELY SPACE AGE HOME IN SANTA ANA, ANTHONY REICHARDT CAN GET LOST IN 
THE '50S EVERY DAY. COMPLETE WITH ALUMINUM CHRISTMAS TREE, IT'S ONE OF FOUR 
HOUSES TO BE FEATURED IN A HOLIDAY TOUR SATURDAY.

 Remember the movie "36 Hours," where the Nazis go to great lengths to fool 
James Garner into believing World War II has been over for years, so he'll 
spill the beans about D-day?  
</P>
<P>
 OK, now suppose you were the leaders of the Democratic Party in decline, and 
you've kidnaped Newt Gingrich in order to pry from him the details of the 
Republican agenda. Your only hope of doing so is to convince Newt it's not 
1994, but, rather, that he's back in the cozy days of the Eisenhower 
Administration. When the knockout gas wears off, it's crucial that his 
surroundings give no hint that 3 1/2 decades have passed since that atomic 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 If the locale were Anthony Reichardt's Santa Ana home, consider the job done. 
The Postal Service truck driver has made his 1930's Mediterranean-style home 
into a model of '50s style, and the sensation of time-warp is only heightened 
by the seasonal decor. There's the duo-level kidney-shaped Formica coffee 
table, the Jetsons-looking curtain designs, the boomerang-shaped ashtrays, the 
Electrolux vacuum cleaner in a corner, gleaming like a Buck Rogers rocket pack. 
By the living room's front window is a seven-foot, chrome-bright aluminum 
Christmas tree, lit by a rotating color wheel. Topping the tree is an 
illuminated opaque satellite, with clear and gold spires. 
</P>
<P>
 His table settings are all in the space-age Franciscan starburst pattern. The 
kitchen counters feature a pink plastic GE radio, pink flour and sugar 
containers and a matching foil and wax paper dispenser. There's a milkshake 
machine, an electric "Can-omatic" can opener and other amenities with 
futuristic brand names.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things had ' -- omatic' in their titles then," Reichardt noted. 
"Everything had to be automatic."

 Look out Reichardt's back window, and see 10 pink lawn flamingos in frozen 
cavort on the lawn. Out a side window, two 1959 Cadillacs sit in the driveway, 
with the whimsical, fabulous and utterly useless fins that once drove Nikita 
Khrushchev into a rage.  
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich might never see Reichardt's home, but you can. It is one of four 
being featured in a Tea and Holiday Home Tour to be held Saturday in his 
Wilshire Square neighborhood. The others, built between 1926 and 1946 in the 
Renaissance Revival, Mission Revival and Early Ranch styles -- will each 
express a different style of holiday decor. The home tour, from 11 a.m. to 4 
p.m., costs $7. The tea sittings, held in an additional two homes, will be at 
11 a.m. and 2 p.m. and cost $18, including the home tour. Call (714) 549-1478 
for information.

 Reichardt participated in a summer home tour and was told his house was a real 
hit. His is a strangely compelling bunch of stuff, touching off waves of 
nostalgia, perhaps made more strong because it is essentially a nostalgia for a 
future we never got to see.  
</P>
<P>
 The '50s were the jet age, the space age and the atomic age, which is a lot of 
ages for one decade. America's response to the fears of all that change -- 
which included the entirely new bother of nuclear annihilation -- was to act is 
if that change had already settled and we were already in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 We subsumed the inconceivable into the ordinary. We may not have understood 
the sonic booms that shook our homes, but they were homes stocked with 
aerodynamic, jet-wing-shaped furniture. The Russians have a satellite in outer 
space ? No matter, we've got one on our Christmas tree. The atom may kill us, 
but in the meantime, its image looks cool on appliance logos. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, Reichardt didn't live through the '50s. Being 33, he wasn't even 
born until they were good and over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't there for it, but I think it's like it was with my parents, where 
the things they liked were things they remember as kids that their parents had. 
It's like that with me. A lot of these things overflowed into the '60s when I 
was growing up," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Watertown, Wis., and Santa Ana, "everybody had the horrendous 
Formica and blond furniture and stuff like that, and sofas with this 
'industructalon' material here," he said, stroking the textured surface of his 
couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his furnishings come from his family: his TV with the picture tube 
hovering over the console like a robot's head, for instance.  
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother did what any woman in the '50s would do after getting in a car 
accident: She went and bought living room furniture with the settlement. The TV 
was one of the things she bought. It works -- we just watched the Christmas 
parade on it the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 "That chair over there was called the 'naughty chair' when I was a kid. It 
swivels, and when you were bad you had to sit in it and face the wall. I don't 
use it for that anymore. That's the third reupholstering it's had," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the vintage items, though, are more recently acquired, as is 
Reichardt's interest in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This happened by accident really," he said. "I had got a condo that was all 
brand-new and perfect and modern, so I had put all this new furniture in it -- 
glass and chrome. I sold the place, and that furniture didn't really fit 
anywhere else, so I figured I'd sell it off and start over when I bought 
another house. So, in a series of apartments I started off with just a TV and 
two beach chairs.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then I'd go to the swap meet with my friends, and say, 'Oooh, look at that 
ugly lamp, and it's so cheap.' and I'd bring it home. Then I'd think, 'I could 
get a cheap weird table to put it on too.' Then pretty soon I started realizing 
as it all came together that it didn't look so bad. It looked kind of neat 
together because everything was shaped strange. Now, it all looks like art to 
me, and every piece also has a story . . . of how I got it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though he only started accumulating '50s items five years ago, he amassed so 
many -- rotating the best ones into his house -- that his garage was 
overflowing. When he took some of it to sell at a swap meet, he found he was 
far from the only interested collector. With friend Eric Wittman, he started a 
business a year ago called Groovomatic; they now sell excess '50s items in an 
Orange antique mall.  
</P>
<P>
 He still has a lot more fun buying items than selling them. For three years 
he's spent his vacation driving back to his Wisconsin hometown with a friend, 
usually Wittman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a slave for the post office for 15 years, since I was out of high 
school, and it's nice, but it's not especially fulfilling. So this is what's 
fulfilling to me. When I leave there, this is what I do.  
</P>
<P>
 "Each summer I take a trip on Highway 66 in my '59 Cadillac and drive the 
two-lane (road) through the main streets of all the little towns and go into 
every little shop and every dopey diner. We refuse to go to McDonald's or any 
of that stuff. We want the greasy spoons and mom-and-pop motels. It's more 
exciting, fun, something to remember," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A '50s Cadillac can hold a lot -- stories abound of whole bands, and their 
instruments, touring in them -- but Reichardt has found they have limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That dinette set in there almost proved to much," he said, referring to a 
marbled Formica masterpiece in a breakfast nook. "This trip last summer, I 
found that in Oklahoma. By that point the car was basically stuffed. But I 
couldn't leave it there because it was so danged cheap, and I wanted it bad. We 
sat out front of the place we bought it and took every nut, bolt and staple off 
the thing to break it all down into pieces. It was like putting a puzzle 
together when I got home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, a couple of years back we were stuffed already and on our way home, but 
you still can't help stopping at places. You're force-feeding things in at that 
point. And in St. George, Utah, we made one 'just one more stop' at a place, 
and coming out of the driveway the car was dragging so bad that it tore the 
straps off that held the gas tank on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll probably take a truck next time. I put 6,000 miles on the car each 
time, and I'm starting to feel I'm pressing my luck." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He has to take such trips because '50s items are getting tapped out locally, 
though he still finds pieces at swap meets, thrift shops and estate sales, the 
latter being the best places to look, Reichardt says.  
</P>
<P>
 Some things are still bargains. His aluminum tree was picked up by Wittman at 
a rummage sale in Garden Grove for $2.50. It was just the thing Reichardt 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always remember as a kid driving by windows that had these and being 
fascinated watching the colors change," he said. The reason the trees are 
typically lit by a color wheel floodlight instead of traditional tree lights is 
that -- along with looking cool, "The tree is metal, you see, so if you put a 
string of lights on it and any part of the tree contacts with the electricity, 
it's curtains." 
</P>
<P>
 His tree, by the way, is decorated with vintage Christmas 45 records. In 
another corner is a Christmas scene Reichardt found in Barstow, with a Santa, a 
clear plastic tree and a kaleidoscopic rotating plastic stained glass window. 
His black vinyl bar waits, appointed with festive glassware and colorful 
appointments, and the Phil Spector Christmas album sits ready by the stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like Christmas, especially the music," Reichardt said. "Sometimes in 
July I'll pull out my Connie Francis Christmas album just to listen to it. And 
like everyone, I think Christmas is a great time to entertain your friends, to 
drink and laugh. And it's an excuse to pull out and use every Donna Reed relish 
tray I have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though he's totally into having a '50s house -- his two concessions are a 
microwave and CD player -- that totality has a structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I try to do is be authentic rather than make fun of it. Some people 
get this stuff and overkill with it. I try to put it as if it were the way it 
was, not with 50,000 cocktail shakers on display," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his neighbors don't share his taste in '50s decor, the homes and 
lifestyle in the neighborhood hearken to those times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an amazing little oasis here in Santa Ana. When you tell people it's 
near McFadden and Edinger they go, Uggh, but then you see how nice it is, all 
the homes and how they're kept up. You see the people pushing strollers and 
wagons with their kids, having block parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've only been here since April. I hadn't even moved in yet, and people were 
coming up and introducing themselves. My power was out when I was moving in, 
and one neighbor came over with an extension cord in his hand. . . . This sweet 
80-year-old neighbor to this side is always calling and saying, 'Oh, I was 
baking something; come out to your fence, and there'll be a plate there.' This 
is like Mayberry." 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to make one want to live in an era he's never known.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's that I was born too late," he said, "but I like 
everything from it, even driving my two old cars with all the problems they 
have. Everything from that time, just the way it was all made was so stylish 
and outlandish. Nothing was ever square and perfect; instead it was all 
sweeping and curving and jagged. And I like that. It was like adventurous ."

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; KEEPING OPTIONS OPEN; VICTORIAN HIGH TEA AND AUCTION 
BENEFIT SHELTER SERVICES FOR BATTERED WOMEN 
</P>

<P>
 Saying that her sister Nicole Brown Simpson has "given me the inspiration to 
make a difference," Tanya Brown showed up at an auction Sunday to benefit Human 
Options, a Laguna Beach shelter for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 25, the youngest of Nicole's sisters, joined about 350 guests at Gustaf 
Anders Restaurant in Santa Ana for "Starry, Starry Night," a Victorian high tea 
and auction. The $45-per-person benefit was expected to net $45,000 for Human 
Options. Shelter Finds a New Ally 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, dressed in a red pantsuit, mingled with other guests around tables 
filled with fancy gift baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 She first became interested in supporting Human Options several months ago 
after attending a luncheon where one of the shelter's clients spoke. Later she 
visited the shelter: 
</P>
<P>
 "These women go through such a hard time, but there was such happiness and 
joy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a resident of Monarch Beach, said her sister's violent death has 
inspired her and other family members to become more active in supporting 
shelters for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you become educated about abuse, and knowing your family member was 
(abused), you're not going to sit back and watch this happen," she said. "You 
have to donate time; you have to donate your heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to think my sister had to die for me to realize this happens. We'll 
do what we can to help other shelters." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's support (she served on the auction committee) has been an asset to 
Human Options, said Linda Enochs, event co-chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's making it more possible for us to have a platform on which to speak," 
she said. Families in Crisis 
</P>
<P>
 Like most abuse victims, her name won't be broadcast in the media. Yet a 
red-haired woman who preferred to be identified only as Debe also had a story 
to tell about abuse. She graduated from Human Options in March and is now the 
shelter's house manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Debe, who is studying to be a nurse, said the shelter helped her regain her 
self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you first come to the shelter, you're beaten down so low, they'd have to 
dig a hole in the ground to find you," she said. "You've been hospitalized, and 
often your children have been, too." 
</P>
<P>
 During the holiday season, she's especially conscious of abuse that occurs 
behind closed doors. "People look like they're having a happy Christmas, but 
they're dealing with a lot of trouble," she said. A Way Out 
</P>
<P>
 Human Options operates an emergency shelter in Laguna Beach and a Second Step 
program that provides housing for six to 12 months for women and their 
children. The agency has just broken ground for a new shelter in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the shelter's eighth annual auction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a traditional English high tea with a Swedish twist," said Enochs, 
referring to the buffet of exotic canapes, some topped with shrimp and caviar, 
as well as lemon tartlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also a good way to get started on your Christmas shopping," she said. 
Committee members decorated 120 baskets filled with gifts such as sports 
tickets, dinners and make-overs. The most unusual offering: a fluffy blue 
parakeet in a bird cage decorated all in pink like Barbie's condo -- a modern 
twist on the proverbial partridge in a pear tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were: Gay Sutherland, event co-chairwoman; Vivian Clecak, 
executive director of Human Options; Kathy Bulger-Salter, board president; Lyn 
Wilder, Judy Price, Robynne Roberts, Rosemary Jones, Diana Gairdner, Cathy 
Palmer, Robin Kovich, Kristi Lewis, Marlene Marzo, Kathi Shelor, Yvonne Hayes 
and Susan Jenkins. KATHRYN BOLD

'CIVILIZATION' A LA ZAPPA; THE CULT COMPOSER'S EPIC FINAL WORK IS A COMPLEX 
SUMMATION OF A LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RIP RENSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than a decade, Frank Zappa labored intermittentlyon "Civilization, 
Phaze III," a sprawling, 113-minute epic, marked by the most complex, ambitious 
musical experiments the composer ever tackled. 
</P>
<P>
 Finishing the massive task assumed an increasing urgency after Zappa was 
diagnosed with cancer in 1990, and he made the last adjustments just weeks 
before his death at age 52 one year ago Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very much about finishing his life," his widow, Gail Zappa, says 
of the music. "He said that after he finished this, he had nothing more to do. 
I asked him, 'Is there anything else you want to tell me about?' He said, 'No, 
I've done everything that I can.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The weighty work -- described in Zappa's CD notes as an "opera-pantomime, with 
choreographed physical activity" -- is being released this week, on the heels 
of his induction to theRock and Roll Hall of Fame. (The ceremony is in New York 
on Jan. 12.) There are plans for a stage presentation conceived by the composer 
and to be designed by choreographer Jamey Hampton (of the ISO dance troupe) and 
Matt Groening, the creator of "The Simpsons" and a longtime Zappa fan. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-CD set of the music, however, will at first be available only by mail 
order through Zappa's own Barking Pumpkin company, (818) PUMPKIN. Gail Zappa 
allows that this may not be the best way to get the work to a general audience, 
but it is, she says, the way to get it to those who care most. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to see who's really out there, and how much attention they're paying 
to the importance of having Frank's music continue to be in their lives," she 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 "It may seem unfair, in many ways, to treat his music this way," she says. 
"But (Frank) gave this record to me. And (it is) of particular importance to me 
personally. I wanted to make it available to those people who are loyal fans of 
Frank in this country . . . without having to rely on an industry that never 
supported Frank in any way as a composer ." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, although Zappa was dedicated to serious composing from his mid 
teens, he's probably best known for such novel pop satires as "Valley Girl" 
(performed with daughter Moon). Conceptually and stylistically, "Civilization, 
Phaze III" is a continuation of the 1967 avant-garde ballet/narrative "Lumpy 
Gravy," and his 1968 album "We're Only in It for the Money," which has been 
called the cynical flip side of the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club 
Band." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that 'Phaze III' is perhaps the ultimate destiny of this particular 
aspect (of Zappa's work)," Gail Zappa says. " 'Phaze III' probably started off 
to be one thing, but because he worked so hard to finish it before he died, it 
became something a little different than what he originally intended." 
</P>
<P>
 Composed largely on a Synclavier, a sophisticated computer-driven synthesizer 
capable of producing virtually any imaginable sound, the piece is basically 
orchestral in texture, and about a third of it was performed by the European 
new music group Ensemble Modern. There are 19 pieces of music interspersed with 
a running dialogue leftover from the 1967 "Lumpy Gravy" sessions, and new 
dialogue recorded by daughter Moon and various Zappa associates, including his 
Synclavier assistant, Todd Yvega. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Lumpy Gravy," Zappa prompted friends to "ramble incoherently" into 
microphones planted inside a piano, then edited their various speeches into an 
absurdist commentary that punctuated original orchestral music. "Civilization, 
Phaze III" continues that tradition, as Zappa's own CD liner notes explain: 
</P>
<P>
 "What emerged from the (1967) texts was a vague plot regarding pigs and 
ponies, threatening the lives of characters who inhabit a large piano. In 
'Civilization, Phaze III,' we get a few more clues about the lives of the piano 
dwellers and note that the external evils have only gotten worse since we first 
met them." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the centerpiece of the work is an 18-minute, six-movement composition 
titled "N-Lite." It is likely that no piece of music in history contains so 
much densely packed, meticulously arranged diverse sound. The composer 
described the work simply as "a frightening son-of-a-bitch." 
</P>
<P>
 The title of the piece was merely a bit of convenient computer-ese. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was put together out of two unrelated sequences," he explained in a 1992 
interview. "There's a group of notes in front of this one sequence that just 
happens to sound like 'In the Navy' from that Village People song. You don't 
realize it until it's gone by, and then -- that's 'In the Navy'! So that's the 
'N,' and the 'Lite' part is this sequence that was basically a bunch of very 
fast and short synthesizer pockets that had the computer title 'Thousand Points 
of Light.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Groening describes the album as "Stravinsky-esque orchestral textures with 
(composer) Conlon Nancarrow's tireless forward propulsion presented with the 
most cutting-edge technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Laughing, he adds, "To give more of a sound bite, this music should finally 
get Zappa taken truly seriously as a composer. There is nothing else in 
contemporary music that sounds anything like it. I'll be listening to this 
piece for the rest of my life -- that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one of the titles, "Beat the Reaper," would seem to grimly attest to 
the circumstances under which the composer worked to complete the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listening to it," said Groening, who befriended Zappa late in the composer's 
life, "it feels like Frank was trying to cram as many musical ideas as 
possible, one after the other, into this piece. It's very thick and dense and 
overpowering. Even if you think you know Frank Zappa's music, I don't think 
anybody could be sufficiently prepared for the powerhouse that this thing 
represents." 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Zappa says that there's no doubt that her husband meant this to be taken 
as his summary "master work." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's called mortality," she says. "I think (this work) has a lot to do with 
Frank knowing that he wasn't going to be able to realize a lot of the things 
that he wanted to. So then you do what you can. Part of it is an expression of 
that. I don't think he was in a hurry, as much as he was pragmatic and said, 'I 
can do this .' I see it as a big-time 'Thanks for the Memories,' in some ways."

CASTING HIS HAT BACK INTO THE REVIEWING RING; TELEVISION: FILM EXPERT LEONARD 
MALTIN RETURNS TO THE JOB HE WAS HIRED TO DO 12 YEARS AGO ON 'ENTERTAINMENT 
TONIGHT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The familiar "ET theater" seat that Leonard Maltin has warmed for the past 12 
years is gone this season. In its place is a cavernous film vault, a stylized 
celluloid repository with arching wood ceiling beams and gray, tomblike walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Maltin's "Entertainment Tonight" colleague, John Tesh, jokingly likens it to 
"the Starship Enterprise with film cans." 
</P>
<P>
 The new set is just one of the changes for Maltin this season. He also has 
returned to reviewing films, the job he originally was hired to do 12 years 
ago, near the end of the show's first season. He hasn't done film reviews for 
seven years, focusing instead on feature stories. 
</P>
<P>
 The pioneer syndicated entertainment newsmagazine has undergone periodic 
changes over the years to keep things fresh. But one thing remains constant: 
the bearded and bespectacled Maltin -- if not America's most famous movie buff, 
certainly its most enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question Maltin loves what he's doing. And although he has 
interviewed his share of contemporary celebrities -- from Robert De Niro to 
Meryl Streep -- his forte is movie history. Maltin does stories that no one 
else on TV's entertainment beat might even think of doing. 
</P>
<P>
 How about an interview with veteran ventriloquist Senor Wences? Or a piece on 
forgotten silent film comedian Lupino Lane? Or Dorothy Granger, "the Queen of 
Two-Reel Comedies"? 
</P>
<P>
 "He is invaluable because there is only one Leonard Maltin," producer Bill 
Olson says. "Above all, he's an expert -- a world-renowned film buff -- but 
he's a fan underneath all of that. He just loves it and he never tires of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maltin's biggest thrill? 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to my first Golden Boot Awards and within five minutes met both 
Roy Rogers and Gene Autry," he said. "I thought I'd died and gone to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 Maltin's film-buff dream job at "ET," however, is only part of his workload. 
If his life were a movie, this is where a quick-cut montage would be inserted. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently completed a 10-day tour to promote the 25th anniversary edition of 
"Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide" (Signet: $7.99). The compilation of 
capsulized film reviews, which he and a staff of seven contributing editors 
revise each year, is now as thick as a club sandwich: 1,580 pages, with more 
than 19,000 entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Maltin, who was only a 17-year-old high school senior in Teaneck, N.J., when 
he was signed to do the book, received name-above-the-title status a decade ago 
thanks to his exposure on "ET." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, his latest book, "Leonard Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia" (E.P. 
Dutton), arrived in bookstores. The author of a dozen books on filmmaking spent 
the past year -- working weekends, early mornings and evenings -- on the 
comprehensive volume, which contains career essays and biographical information 
on 2,000 actors, directors and writers. 
</P>
<P>
 If that weren't enough to keep him busy, he hosts "Leonard Maltin on Video," a 
daily, one-minute syndicated radio show that airs locally on KNX-AM (1070). He 
also does monthly movie commentaries for the cable TV service Starz and 
recently completed a three-year run as an on-line columnist for Prodigy. He has 
produced, written and hosted a number of cable-TV programs and a series for 
Republic Pictures Home Video on the making of classics such as "High Noon" and 
"The Quiet Man." 
</P>
<P>
 "ET," however, remains his bread and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the first film critic ever to work out of an actual Hollywood film 
studio, a stroke of luck that hardly goes unappreciated by a man who grew up 
setting his alarm clock so he could wake up to catch a 2:30 a.m. showing of "My 
Man Godfrey" on "The Late Late Show" and spent his formative years in the 
balcony of the New Yorker Theater and other Manhattan revival houses doing what 
he calls his "basic training." 
</P>
<P>
 "I never get blase about coming here," said Maltin, 43, walking along a studio 
street after a recent "ET" taping. "Alice and I are constantly pinching 
ourselves, almost literally, because this is like living in Fantasyland for us, 
a couple of movie lovers."  
</P>
<P>
 Leonard and Alice Maltin's Toluca Lake home is a treasure trove of movie 
memorabilia, from a plaster Buster Keaton life mask to a back-lit collection of 
silent-era glass coming-attraction slides. Hundreds of movie books, still 
photograph files and even more memorabilia fill the converted guest house out 
back that serves as Maltin's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Collecting is a disease; it's just less dangerous than drugs or something 
like that," observed Maltin, sipping tea from a yellow Tweety mug. 
</P>
<P>
 Maltin's infatuation with the movies began at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an encapsulated "Movie Guide"-style version of his movie-mad life 
story: New Jersey kid falls in love with Laurel and Hardy, "Our Gang" and 
Buster Keaton comedies on TV at 4, turns his love of old movies into a writing 
career at 13 and at 15 purchases Film Fan Monthly for $175. 
</P>
<P>
 Maltin continued to publish the little fanzine, which boasted a readership of 
2,000 hard-core films buffs around the world, until he was 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about personal journalism, this really was," he said. "I never had to 
worry that a reference was too arcane or obscure in this magazine because, if 
anything, some of the readers were hipper than I was to some of the oddities of 
old moviedom." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was in high school, Maltin said, "I was pretty well eating, 
sleeping, breathing movies. That was it. I fell into a crowd in New York of 
die-hard old movie buffs who had several little private film societies that 
would gather several times a week and show rare films, double and triple 
features." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how he got to see "all sorts of great stuff and really learn a lot." 
But, he said, it did nothing for his social life.  
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, Maltin met Alice, then a secretary in the sales department at 
Bantam Books, at a film society silent movie double bill in 1974. In Alice, he 
found a kindred spirit, someone who grew up in a family that remained seated to 
watch the movie credits roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got depressed one time," he said, "because I didn't really have any social 
life and I didn't know how to pursue one, but I didn't really want to give up 
what I was doing because I liked it. I'm awfully happy I met Alice when I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Maltin's high-profile job on "Entertainment Tonight," needless to say, changed 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite part of the job, he said, "is that I've gotten to do stories that 
nobody else does."  
</P>
<P>
 When "Forrest Gump" came out, he said, "I did a story on Lon Chaney, because 
there's (actor) Gary Sinise being legless through the art of digital 
computerization and I thought, well, let's compare that to Lon Chaney, who 
bound up his legs and really did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maltin flashed that familiar grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call it doing my missionary work, getting to actually possibly turn people 
onto things that they don't know. So what a wonderful feeling, spreading the 
gospel of old movies."

DANCING -- AND EDUCATING -- IN THE STREETS; DANCE: IF CHOREOGRAPHER JOEL 
CHRISTENSEN WANTS TO BUILD AN AUDIENCE FOR HIS TROUPE, HE FIGURES THE BEST 
APPROACH IS TO MEET THEM OUTDOORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Choreographer Joel Christensen has been pounding the pavement lately. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old Toronto-born hoofer, who's one of the whiz kids of the 
mega-athletic modern strain known as "hyperdance," isn't looking for work. But 
he has been taking his dance to the streets, at sites from the Third Street 
Promenade to the UCLA quad. 
</P>
<P>
 Tripping the light fantastic outdoors is no mere "Singin' in the Rain" homage, 
though, it's a career move. "I thought 'What can I do to make myself stand 
out?' " says Christensen, seated in the lobby of the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center, as his company rehearses nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking people in L.A. would be less open to it than New Yorkers," 
says the New York University-educated Christensen of his al fresco 
performances. "But I also thought, 'I don't have a choice anymore.' I don't 
know how else to educate the public and get people to come to my shows." 
</P>
<P>
 Such brash schemes, after all, may be just what it takes to make your mark on 
the L.A. dance scene. "I've never met anybody in the dance world who's been 
here longer than a year who wouldn't say it's problematic," Christensen says. 
"Dance has a lot to compete with." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if anyone is up to the challenge, the energetic choreographer seems a 
likely candidate. His Christensen Dance Company presents "Machine" at the 
500-seat Tom Bradley Theatre at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, Thursday 
through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill includes two new works -- one of which is the concert premiere of 
"100," the piece that the company has been performing outdoors -- as well as 
the previously seen "Boing," "Blocks" and "Tired." It's the first time that the 
troupe -- which includes Christensen, Maryann Thomson, Caroline Aizawa and Bill 
Schurman -- has performed in a venue of this size. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bold stroke of moving up to so large a space so quickly is Christensen 
all over. 
</P>
<P>
 A former member of fellow "hyperdancer" Mehmet Sander's company, he first got 
into dance at Beverly Hills High. "I was signed up for football and the dance 
teacher found out that I was interested and came over and pulled me out of 
line," says the 1988 grad. "I went to rehearsal, fell in love with it and 
within days decided that was my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen went on to train at NYU but didn't graduate. Then, in May of 1992, 
he returned to L.A. to get married. He ended up staying longer than originally 
planned, largely so that his wife could be around for her daughter's last two 
years of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 And since then, he, like Sander before him, has caught the eye of dance 
aficionados with task-oriented, physically risky dances that often entail 
stunts with heavy objects such as tires -- although his is a decidedly more 
lighthearted approach than Sander's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Christensen knows that it takes more than just making dances to get a 
career on track. "It's pretty easy to interact with the dance world as a male 
dancer, but as a choreographer, you've got to prove yourself," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis has to be twofold. "Right now, it's about enjoying my work and 
also achievement -- so that people respond and I don't have to keep 
self-producing," Christensen continues. "Granted I do it for the sake of doing 
it, but I can't deny that success plays a role." 
</P>
<P>
 Hence such tactics as the outdoor concerts. "It was so satisfying to see 
somebody look at it, and if they weren't interested, just walk away," says 
Christensen of his company's five performances on Santa Monica's Third Street 
Promenade. "And people stopped and watched too. It was so honest." 
</P>
<P>
 "For me," he says, "that's what dance is all about -- 'What can I do that will 
get you to watch me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it has worked so well that Christensen is no longer sure that New 
York is the best place for an emerging choreographer like himself. "I have much 
more momentum here than I expected," he says. "In the final analysis, maybe it 
feels less oppressive in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . When dance gets hard here, I think about New York. But L.A. has less 
competition. It feels freer, more friendly." 
</P>
<P>

downtown. Thursday-Saturday, 8 p.m., $8. (213) 485-1631.

THREE COMEDIES WILL JOIN CBS SCHEDULE NEXT MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL HOWARD CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS, last season's top-rated network, confirmed Monday that it will add three 
new comedy series and relocate eight established ones next month in a sweeping 
prime-time schedule overhaul designed to keep pace with this season's ratings 
leader, ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 On Mondays, "Cybill" will replace creator Diane English's "Love & War" at 9:30 
p.m., beginning Jan. 2. CBS hopes "Murphy Brown" will provide a strong lead-in 
for the new sitcom, starring Cybill Shepherd as a twice-divorced actress with 
two daughters from different marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-year medical drama "Chicago Hope," which was battered in the ratings 
opposite NBC's hit "ER" on Thursdays, will then step into "Northern Exposure's" 
time slot Monday at 10 p.m. To breathe life into "Chicago Hope," CBS will air 
the series four times during Christmas week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "Northern Exposure" and "Love & War" will move on Jan. 4 to a 
completely reconfigured Wednesday, featuring a comedy block to take on ABC's 
solid night of sitcoms led by "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading off for CBS at 8 p.m. will be Delta Burke's "Women of the House," from 
"Designing Women" producers Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason. In 
the new show, Burke reprises her Suzanne Sugarbaker role, taking over her late 
husband's congressional seat. The politically charged "Hearts Afire," also from 
the husband-and-wife producing team, will follow at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 English's new series, "Double Rush," will come next at 9 p.m., followed by 
"Love & War." "Double Rush" stars Robert Pastorelli -- Murphy Brown's handyman 
-- as the owner of a bicycle messenger service. "Northern Exposure" will bring 
up the rear at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In other moves, CBS will serve up news against strong comedy competition 
Thursdays with "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung" and Dan Rather's "48 Hours" from 
9 p.m. to 11 p.m. On Saturdays, two first-year sitcoms, "The Boys Are Back" and 
"The Five Mrs. Buchanans," will pair up from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daddy's Girls" and "Touched by an Angel" will go on hiatus.

DAVE MATTHEWS STEPS TOWARD SUCCESS; POP MUSIC: HIS BAND IS OFF TO A STRONG 
START AFTER TWO SOLID ALBUMS. ITS FIRST SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TOUR INCLUDES A 
SHOW THURSDAY AT THE COACH HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Dave Matthews Band became a do-it-yourself success by following the same 
principle as Willie Sutton, the famous bank robber: Look to where the money is. 
</P>
<P>
 For an unusual, acoustic-based jam band in Charlottesville, Va., the most 
ready money was to be found in the ample budgets of college entertainment 
committees and fraternity coffers. With its efforts greased by that cash flow, 
the Matthews band was able to travel extensively in the early 1990s, build an 
audience, and eventually reap the rewards with uncommonly strong album sales 
for a new, emerging act. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's first album, "Remember Two Things," was a live recording that it 
financed and marketed itself. In a recent phone interview, Matthews, who will 
front the five-piece group in its first series of Southern California dates 
this week (including a show Thursday at the Coach House), said that sales of 
the 1993 release have reached 160,000 copies, a phenomenal total for an album 
not backed by a record company. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Dave Matthews Band records for RCA Records. "Under the Table and 
Dreaming," its first album as a credentialed cog of the music industry, is off 
to a good start: The ready-made audience recruited in heavy regional touring 
and via word of mouth bought 34,000 copies in one week when the album appeared 
two months ago, good for a debut at No. 34 on the Billboard chart. While it has 
slid downward from there, sales have now passed 100,000. The band's first 
video, for the wry, funky R&B-influenced track "What Would You Say" has just 
been released to MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 "We focused on sources of money," Matthews, 27, said of the band's early 
strategy for making its way in the world. "I hate to say it that way, but in a 
lot of ways it was (true). 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get out of town and start making money, so we made the focus 
going to colleges, where the money was. We made that a strategy and sort of 
moved around the Southeast. It supports you, and you get an audience, and the 
next time you go back you don't have to play a fraternity party with the 
bottles flying; you can go to a bar with the bottles flying, and the next time 
to a theater with the bottles flying farther." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews is an effusive, if slightly scattered, speaker with a wry tone and a 
penchant for mimicking accents to color his conversation. His band's hallmark 
is its ability to bring new colors to the now-familiar jam-oriented style 
pushed by bands like the Spin Doctors, Big Head Todd & the Monsters and Blues 
Traveler (whose front man, John Popper, adds his distinctive whistling 
harmonica to "What Would You Say"). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leroi Moore's sweet, Wayne Shorter-style saxophone is the primary lead 
instrument, violinist Boyd Tinsley adds further non-standard accents, and the 
electric guitar, de rigueur in most rock bands, is non grata in this one. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a spacious, distortion-free sound that moves with light, airy 
currents, placing the emphasis on beauty and delight in a pop era fraught with 
dense, fractured music. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews, who sings and plays acoustic rhythm guitar, delivers philosophical 
(and sometimes slightly stilted) lyrics in a conversational flow that gets 
interrupted occasionally by a catchy chorus refrain. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs cover a variety of feelings, ranging from the lovely romantic 
balladry of "Lover Lay Down" to explorations of Cobain-esque depths of 
depression in "Rhyme & Reason" and "Warehouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Matthews turns his thin but pliant voice to lighter musings on the 
inscrutability and oddity of life. He's a highly stylized singer who can sound 
like a low-octane version of Eddie Vedder or a less-grim cousin to Adam Duritz 
of Counting Crows. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews' upbringing yo-yoed between South Africa, where he was born, and the 
United States, where his father, a physicist who died when Matthews was in his 
teens, did research. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing high school in Johannesburg, Matthews spent several years 
traveling. By 1990, he had landed in Charlottesville, a university town where 
he had spent part of his childhood. There, he tended bar, waited on tables, and 
set about forming what became the first serious band he had ever been in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had these songs, and I didn't know how I wanted them to be played by a 
band," Matthews recalled. "I never had arranged any music. The one thing I knew 
I didn't want was electric guitars. It wasn't because I don't like them; I grew 
up on them and I love them. But I just didn't want them, because I hear them 
all around." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews recruited saxophonist Moore and drummer Carter Beauford from a 
network of local jazz-oriented players. The band's young bassist, Stefan 
Lessard, was recommended by a friend of Matthews who was giving the teen-ager 
music lessons. The band had a keyboard player early on but eventually turned to 
violinist Tinsley. A second acoustic-guitar player, Tim Reynolds, plays on 
"Under the Table and Dreaming," but Matthews said family commitments and other 
musical projects have kept him from joining the touring lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 While his band's fortunes have surged over the past 1 1/2 years, Matthews also 
had to cope with tragedy. His older sister, Anne, to whom the new album is 
dedicated, was killed last January in a shooting in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a terrible turn of events," not related to South Africa's 
turbulent racial politics, he said. Another song, the lyrical closing 
instrumental, "34," is dedicated to a friend of the band who died of hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Such events would seem to provide more than enough justification for the dark, 
angry tone that defines many, if not most, emerging new bands. Matthews insists 
on a wider vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music, in my life, has been one of the things that's healed me, made me want 
to dance, to continue," he said (a point of view taken on "Jimi Thing," in 
which a troubled Matthews listens to Hendrix music with the plea, "If you could 
keep me floating just for a while / 'Til I get to the end of this tunnel"). 
</P>
<P>
 "I often love angry and painful music," he said. "I'm angry, but not only 
angry. I'm frustrated, but I'm not only frustrated. The focus for all of us is 
to express everything. If we play all of (the emotions), I get to express all 
the things that I am." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dave Matthews Band and David Gray play Thursday at 8 p.m. at the Coach 
House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $15. (714) 496-8930.

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; 'SANTA' STILL THE SCREEN KING

<P>
 Business was down from last weekend--par for the course after the busy 
Thanksgiving holiday stretch. Still, it now seems certain that 1994 will edge 
out last year's record-breaking $5.2 billion in box-office grosses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Santa Clause" easily held onto first place in a marketplace chock-full of 
kiddie movies such as "The Lion King," "The Swan Princess" and "Miracle on 34th 
Street." 20th Century Fox, whose "Miracle" remake is struggling to bring in the 
younger crowd, had more bad news with the dismal opening of its family comedy 
"Trapped in Paradise," starring Dana Carvey, Nicolas Cage and Jon Lovitz.
