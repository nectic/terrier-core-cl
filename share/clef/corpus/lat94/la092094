O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; THE OFFBEAT GETS STRONG PLAY

 What do you get when you put two quirky cult figures on a double bill? A cult 
figure quirk-off, if the acoustic Peter Himmelman/Robyn Hitchcock show at the 
Coach House Sunday night was any indication. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they are not household names except among the show's far-from-capacity 
audience, Englishman Hitchcock and Minnesota-born, L.A.-based Himmelman both 
have had lengthy careers (dating back to the mid-'70s in Hitchcock's case). 
Hitchcock comes from the Syd Barrett surrealist school of turning dreams into 
songs. Though far from a mainstream rocker, Himmelman is a more direct 
songwriter, grappling with complex emotions and difficult themes. Onstage, 
though, he tends to balance all that weight with free-flying humor. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was Sunday, as he not only opened his solo set with a -- one assumes -- 
unreleased song about the shortcomings of being a dachshund (how the little 
fellows go thirsty while German shepherds get to drink from the toilet bowl and 
such) but also enlisted a member of the audience to dance in sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Himmelman's singing voice sounds like an appealing cross between Elvis 
Costello and the early, pre-bellicose Neil Diamond. Between songs, though, he 
was a vocal chameleon, maniacally and expertly changing characters in a way 
that recalled Peter Sellers' Clare Quilty in "Lolita." In one instance, 
Himmelman introduced himself as country star Travis Tritt, leaped into a 
feminine example of interpretive dance, and then asserted in Tritt's manly 
Southern voice: "I'll deny doing that. It'll be your word against mine." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest test of his impromptu skills came when he asked the audience to 
feed him emotions around which to base a song. "How about one for when you 
really have to go to the bathroom?" one woman asked. After Himmelman had 
obliged, fairly brilliantly, the woman's companion requested: "How about one 
for when you have an embarrassing girlfriend?" 
</P>
<P>
 At which point Himmelman extemporized a song that commented on the fellow's 
clothing and concluded: 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the girlfriend that's embarrassing.  
</P>
<P>
 Something that's very true:  
</P>
<P>
 The embarrassing one  
</P>
<P>
 Is you.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, Himmelman had that couple and another come up onstage to dance in a 
merry circle as he had the club dim all the lights except its disco ball. It 
says something for the strength of his songwriting that this setting did little 
to detract from what he was singing, "Beneath the Damage and the Dust," a hard 
and moving look at a homeless woman. 
</P>
<P>
 On record, Himmelman offers his songs in a rich, inventive sonic context. 
Stripped down to just voice and guitar or piano, they were just as powerful in 
evoking spiritual longings ("Been Set Free," "Impermanent Things") or the 
day-to-day distances between souls ("Difficult to Touch," the haunting "Waning 
Moon"). 
</P>
<P>
 Though several of his songs don't want for irony, Himmelman also is capable of 
the direct, open-hearted "Raina," about the brief moment when all life's cares 
and distractions dropped away as he first saw his newborn daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday I saw the Devil in my bed, I could have strangled him, but I'm 
English, though," sang Hitchcock in "The Devil's Coachman" during his solo set. 
The typically British reserve of the character in the lyric also is present in 
Hitchcock's work, even at his most jarringly surreal. 
</P>
<P>
 At least as often as his dreamscape images connect in new ways of expressing 
human feelings, they also come off as merely clever and emotionally indirect to 
the point of being babble. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Himmelman's immediate, far-ranging and sometimes physical humor, 
Hitchcock's quirkiness Sunday was limited to his wordplay. He has a gift for 
dissemblance which he used between songs to tell rambling metaphysical shaggy 
god stories. At one point a napkin sighted on the stage prompted him to invent 
a tale about Napoleon's soldiers being halted by a huge sheet of paper they had 
to try to fold eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchcock has concocted some wonderfully strange pop confections over the 
years, but his lengthy 17-song set didn't touch on many of them. There were 
more snippets of choice wordplay and imagery in some songs, including such 
lines as "It rains like a slow divorce" and "People get what they deserve: Time 
is round and space is curved." 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchcock's story-songs, like those of Pink Floyd avatar Barrett, play out on 
a lysergic landscape full of fanciful phrases and seeming non sequiturs. But 
Barrett had the advantage of being certifiably mentally ill, his songs 
propelled outward by inner demons, while Hitchcock too often -- at least at the 
Coach House -- seemed just cutesy and deliberately obscure.

THEATER REVIEW; 'CRIMSON THREAD' A FAMILIAR FAMILY TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Crimson Thread," the title of the newest production at the Pasadena 
Playhouse, refers to the tie that binds three generations of Irish sisters. As 
it turns out, the thread also binds playwright Mary Hanes' tale to many, many 
other immigrant stories and stitches them into one gigantic cliche. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanes seems somehow so innocent of the staleness of her dialogue that at times 
the play almost achieves a childlike freshness. Almost. One can spend the 
entire evening anticipating the exact phrasing of the next emotional outburst. 
There are three acts, three pairs of sisters, three tragedies. A gold locket is 
handed down from generation to generation. A little bit of history. Lots of 
tears. Strength, courage, love. Separation, reunion. A civics lesson. The play 
is a TV guide synopsis. 
</P>
<P>
 More specifically: Act I. Dun Laoghaire, Ireland, 1869. Two sisters recall 
starving in the famine when they were little (sisters are always telling each 
other of events they both already know about in this play). Bridget (Kathleen 
Noone), a rebel sympathizer, says, "We need the right to own our own land!" 
And, "Is my soul too high a price to pay to ensure that my children will be 
free?" Also: "The doctor bills are adding up." 
</P>
<P>
 Eilis (Stephanie Zimbalist) helps Bridget with money but doesn't approve of 
her radicalism. She says, "You're as much a part of me as my legs and my arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Eilis' husband in America has sent for her, but she doesn't want to leave her 
homeland (she knows "every square inch of it!"). She also doesn't want to leave 
her sister. "If I leave ya," she tells Bridget, "I will always hear the call of 
blood!" 
</P>
<P>
 Bridget comforts her. "Don't you know I'll always be with you?" she says. 
"I'll be the brightest moon that lights up your sky!" They cry.  
</P>
<P>
 Act II. New Bedford, Massachusetts, 1889. Kathleen (Shanna Reed), Eilis' 
daughter, has lost her husband in a storm at sea. Her sister Fionnuala 
(Zimbalist) tells her, "It seems everyone in town has been touched by this 
tragedy." She tells Kathleen something Kathleen probably already knows: "You, 
you lost your only child." Then she asks Kathleen to tell her once more the 
story of the family's voyage to America. Kathleen does. "We were all so full of 
dreams!" she says. They cry. 
</P>
<P>
 Act III. New York City, 1911. Could this scene have something to do with the 
Triangle Shirt Waist factory fire? This time Fionnuala's daughter, Maggie 
(Noone), is a union organizer. Coincidentally, she lives on the same block 
where her grandfather did when he first arrived in the United States: "I guess 
we both came to New York searching for something." She's also an atheist: 
"Where was God on March 25?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her sister Nora (Reed) disapproves. "Life has made you hard," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maggie insists: "I live for the union! I dream for the union!" 
</P>
<P>
 Nora asks, "Do I have to walk a picket line to get you to care about me?" 
There is some crying.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas M. Cariello's set is handsome, and lighting designer Gene Lenahan does 
some nice things with clouds. Otherwise, director Dan Lauria gets performances 
appropriate to an early Sunday evening TV movie for the whole family, which is 
perhaps where "The Crimson Thread" belongs. As drama, it could as well have 
been called "The Cookie Cutter." * "The Crimson Thread," Pasadena Playhouse, 39

ART REVIEW; PICTURING CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Pictorialism in California: Photographs 1900-1940" is an unprecedented 
collaboration between two remarkable institutions, San Marino's Henry E. 
Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens and Malibu's J. Paul 
Getty Museum. The two-part exhibition surveys Southern California pictures at 
the Huntington and Northern California pictures at the Getty, both 
concentrating on a type of camera work that retained often controversial 
prominence for half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, when the Getty Museum established a new curatorial department 
dedicated to photographs -- and underscored the move with the stunning 
simultaneous acquisition of several of the world's most important private 
collections -- opinion in the world of photographic study held that the center 
of scholarship had shifted decisively to the West Coast. With "Pictorialism in 
California," that scholarly focus has now turned to the first pivotal era of 
photographic production on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect "Pictorialism in California" to constitute a major shake-up in 
the conventional approach to its subject. The exhibition includes work by some 
of the most renowned, obsessively studied photographers of the 20th Century, 
including Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham and Edward Weston. A wholesale 
revision in our thinking about their work is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than attempt a full-scale revision of the history of pictorialist 
photography on the West Coast, the curators have taken the opportunity to weave 
together abundant, often errant threads. The show means to synthesize. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, it includes a substantial number of photographs -- 11 in all -- 
by members of the Japanese American camera clubs that were so important, 
especially in Los Angeles, during the 1920s and 1930s. (The iniquitous 
internment of Japanese Americans during World War II brought the clubs -- and 
their influence -- to an abrupt end.) Dennis Reed, an associate dean at L.A. 
Valley College and guest curator for the Huntington's portion of the show, has 
been instrumental in recent years in salvaging from obscurity many of those 
photographers -- Kaye Shimojima, Shigemi Uyeda and Hiromu Kira chief among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early 1980s Reed has overseen two path-breaking exhibitions 
concerned with Japanese American camera clubs. With the current show, their 
photographs have finally taken their appropriate place within the larger 
context of the pictorialist movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The pictorialist philosophy had begun in England in the 1880s and by the turn 
of the century had been championed in New York by Alfred Stieglitz. In San 
Francisco, the California Camera Club became the largest association of 
photographers in the nation to espouse pictorialist ideals. Slightly later, the 
movement spread to Los Angeles and environs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pictorialism is a rather odd amalgam of viewpoints about the use of camera and 
film as tools with which to make art. Two features stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 One is its quasi-scientific aspirations for the camera, which was regarded as 
a sort of mechanical equivalent to the human eye. Pictorialists often employed 
softly focused, muted views of natural scenery, or of the gentle or dramatic 
play of light and shadow across a surface. They were not, however, seeking to 
capture or reproduce a worldly image of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, what they wanted to create was a picture of the effects nature had on 
the human heart and soul. The Romantic Era wedded the Scientific Age in 
pictorialist photography. 
</P>
<P>
 The marriage lasted longest in California. In part, the climate was hospitable 
because the burgeoning commercial titans of Hollywood were busily selling the 
fruits of that same union to the masses, in the form of moving pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The second peculiarity of pictorialist photography is in fact found within its 
relationship to the newly evolving culture of the masses, a phenomenon 
unprecedented in human history. Bluntly put, pictorialism was a reactionary 
impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 Pictorialism grew from a self-conscious urge to make photographs whose style 
would recall the painterly qualities of 19th-Century art. In his essay in the 
handsome catalogue accompanying the show, its co-curator, collector Michael G. 
Wilson, notes that this urge was fueled by a desire to distinguish 
Photography-as-Art from the rapidly expanding mountain of pictures being 
churned out by commercial hacks and legions of Kodak-wielding amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the reactionary genesis of photographic pictorialism, the 
Getty-Huntington collaboration does suggest one noteworthy irony. For in 
addition to the Japanese American photographers so important in Southern 
California, women were catalytic in the north. Laura Adams Armer, Adelaide 
Hanscom, Alma Lavinson, Dorothea Lange, Anne Brigman -- fully half the 
photographs in the Getty portion of the show are by women. 
</P>
<P>
 In a cultural milieu largely shaped by the prerogatives of white men, it's 
worth considering just who in California took up the camera with passionate 
dedication. For them, pictorialist photography offered an unburdened, newly 
possible avenue into art. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; TRISHA YEARWOOD: TENTATIVE STEPS UP THE LADDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing music in places as big as the 15,000-seat Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre 
can do a couple of things to artists working their way up the show-biz ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 If they've been playing small clubs -- as Trisha Yearwood was before signing 
on to open shows for Vince Gill -- the vast spaces can swallow them alive. That 
seemed a distinct possibility in Yearwood's case: The last time she played 
Orange County, a little less than two years ago at the 275-seat Crazy Horse 
Steak House in Santa Ana, the young singer still seemed to be finding her way 
around the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 The other danger -- especially for someone with an elephant-gun caliber voice 
like Yearwood's -- is the tendency to overcompensate for the vast surroundings. 
And there were times during her 45-minute set at Irvine Meadows on Sunday when 
Yearwood came dangerously close to the Whitney Houston approach: belt, belt and 
belt again. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of "You Say You Will," she indulged needlessly in vocal 
showboating, sustaining a note gratuitously for several seconds. Only her sense 
of humor salvaged the moment: "That's a cheap way to get applause," she 
acknowledged. "And it's not that impressive. Vince can sing higher than that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, in a set that was pretty much the same as the one she'd done back 
at the Crazy Horse, only shorter, she left some room for musical subtlety. And 
when she was truly on -- applying gentle/high-octane dynamics to a ballad like 
"Down on My Knees," or healthy doses of bluesy inflections to flesh songs out 
-- she proved capable of giving Wynonna Judd some serious competition as 
contemporary country's top female singer. 
</P>
<P>
 As a performer, she appears to have quelled the deer-in-the headlights fright 
she was battling a few years ago. Her banter with the crowd was relaxed; some 
of it was even spontaneous (unless she apologetically squishes a grasshopper 
near her mike stand every night). 
</P>
<P>
 She still hasn't completely figured out what to do on stage, though. 
Throughout her set, she'd wander to stage left, stop, sing for a while, wander 
back to center stage, stop, sing for a while, wander to stage right and -- you 
guessed it -- stop and sing for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, she included just two songs from her latest CD, "The Song 
Remembers When," a ballad-heavy collection she released last year. Most of the 
evening's selections were from that album's predecessor, "Hearts in Armor." 
Three were from her 1991 debut, and she included her current single, "XXX's and 
OOO's (An American Girl)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Yearwood to the Irvine bill (she didn't appear with Gill last 
week at the Greek Theatre in Hollywood, where he was reviewed for Saturday's 
Calendar) left opening act Larry Stewart, Restless Heart's former lead singer, 
with just 20 minutes to do five songs. 
</P>
<P>
 But as it turned out, that was plenty of time to spend with the man. The songs 
on his list (including the Restless Heart hit "I'll Still Be Loving You") are 
some of the most contrived, cliche-ridden imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his five-man played them enthusiastically enough. Still, one got the 
feeling that these guys would be pouring their blood, sweat and tears into 
Ukranian choral music if that were the profit center.

ART REVIEWS; 'SHOOTING AT GHOSTS' TARGETS MEMORIES LOST AND KNOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When we watch a movie -- unless it's by Robert Altman or one of the few other 
directors who go in for overlapping dialogue -- we expect to hear clearly what 
everyone has to say and to see (or at least glimpse) all the action. Unlike 
real life, sounds generally are audible in a film only when they reinforce 
something happening on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Visual artists making installations don't feel constrained by these 
conventions. Sounds and voices -- and video or still imagery -- may overlap and 
undercut each other, evoke contrasting experiences and blur past and present, 
real and unreal, making it impossible to get a straightforward, linear sense of 
the piece as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Earlier Known," a sound-and-video installation by Stuart Bender and 
Angelo Funicelli, viewers must sort through four channels' worth of imagery 
plus three layers of sound, including voices speaking several languages. The 
piece is part of the duo's "Shooting at Ghosts" at the Saddleback College Art 
Gallery (through Oct. 13). 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't that Bender and Funicelli are deliberately being obscure or don't 
wish to communicate. Rather, they are engaged in combatting the myth of the 
single-track narrative cleanly yielding a single "truth." 
</P>
<P>
 As in real life, viewers are obliged to process competing streams of 
information and draw on cultural and personal referents to give meaning to what 
they hear and see. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a combination of imagery and texts, two of the video screens juxtapose 
childhood recollections of unique moments ("the day they picked the only 
apricot on the tree") and ritual actions occurring either in religious settings 
or at home (pouring tea, drying the dishes). Some of these rituals are shown 
both in Western and Asian settings. The silvery ping! of Asian temple bells 
occasionally underlines the ceremonial quality of this imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 Images of seemingly unrelated single objects on the other two video screens -- 
a skate key, a shell, a crystal bibelot -- are more elusive. Perhaps they are 
meant to evoke touchstones of memory, like Proust's famous madeleine . 
</P>
<P>
 Several voices relate long stories in German and Italian. Meanwhile, a 
droning, intrusive English speaker describes in exhaustive detail the interior 
of a building. Perhaps he is meant to be a reminder that bald, measurable 
"facts" cannot substitute for the intuitive world of sense experience. In any 
case, for the English-speaking viewer at least, the most memorable "voices" are 
mute, rendered as fragmentary texts on a video screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Buried among more benign memories in these texts is someone recalling his 
father "climbing into (my) bed in the middle of the night and saying, 'Be good 
like a good little girl.' " At other moments in the tape, we read about "the 
look on her face when he told her the truth" and "how his father's skin felt 
like cold wax when they touched." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this what it appears to be, a memory of sexual abuse? None of the visual 
imagery seems directly linked to it. But isn't that the way terrible things 
occur, surrounded by the familiar, repeated actions that make up a life? And 
doesn't a pattern of abuse itself become a ritual, however oppressive? 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the exhibition consists of three videos by Bender and 
Funicelli, whose work has been seen at such major venues as the New York Film 
and Video Festival and the American Film Institute in Los Angeles. 
Unfortunately, none has the open-ended yet compelling allusiveness of the 
installation. It's as if the duo was wary, for some reason, of unleashing the 
more intuitive side of its vision and of using the fabulous electronic 
possibilities of media in more visceral ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven Prophecies" -- a sweeping treatment of good and evil, war and peace -- 
is saddled with a cumbersome format, ponderous declamations, slow pacing and 
Funicelli's off-putting atonal vocal score. (In accompanying notes for the 
exhibition, the artists make the peculiar claim that the soprano's voice 
supplies "warmth" in contrast to the technological aspect of altered newsreel 
footage and an electronic soundtrack.) 
</P>
<P>
 An overly intellectualized, visually unimaginative view of conflict, "The 
Armed Man" is similarly disappointing -- until the memorable final image of a 
man's face eaten away by ants, which imperceptibly turns into a benign patch of 
bare earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The third video, "Anza Borrego" -- a desert view that slowly metamorphoses 
into a cave -- lacks sufficient visual contrast and seems irritatingly New 
Age-y in its twinkly sunshine finale. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Shooting at Ghosts," an installation and three video works by Stuart Bender 
and Angelo Funicelli, continues through Oct. 13 at the Saddleback College Art 
Gallery, 28000 Marguerite Parkway, Mission Viejo. Monday from noon to 5 p.m. 
and 6 to 8 p.m.; Tuesday through Thursday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free. (714)

 SHORT STROKES: Contemporary Latino art from Southern California is the subject 
of "Mi Gente" at the Breeden Gallery in Orange (through Oct. 5). The 
better-known names (Patssi Valdez, Carlos Almaraz, Gronk) are represented by 
routine work, but paintings by relative newcomer Jose Lozano are a pleasant 
surprise. His work has steadily gained technical finish over the past few years 
without sacrificing an idiosyncratically skewed view of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano's trademark deadpan male faces serve as a pale, wallpaper-like 
background for small, oddly delicate paintings of isolated, affectless people 
who have reverted to their childhood selves or are powerless in the clutches of 
nameless forces.

 The ideal exhibition about the work of a theatrical set designer would follow 
one or two productions from start to finish using video clips and tapes as well 
as scale models, photographs and costumes. "Re-created World: The Collaborative 
Vision of Stage Design" at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center (through Oct. 2) is 
not that exhibition, but it does serve as an introduction to an intriguing 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 The show focuses on scale models of sets by Carey Wong for regional 
productions of Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro," Donizetti's "Don Pasquale" 
and other opera classics. Wall labels summarize the plots and offer brief 
comments about the different directorial concepts that result in a "Rigoletto" 
set in a grotto or in a Caribbean shack. Wong's apparent predilection for 
linear, two-dimensional effects rather than architectural massing remains a 
constant.

 "Baseball" Scores High: PBS drew more than twice its average number of viewers 
Sunday for the first night of Ken Burns much-touted "Baseball" series, with an 
estimated 4.8-million households tuning into the two-hour series opener. But 
the show's overnight ratings stopped short of a home run, coming up far below 
the phenomenal numbers Burns earned for "The Civil War" in 1990. In the 24 
markets sampled in 1990, "The Civil War" premiere drew a 13% market share, 
whereas the "Baseball" opener drew only an 8% share of those markets. MOVIES

 New Arts Committee Named: President Clinton acted Monday to pump new life into 
a government-arts partnership, naming 32 private citizens and his wife, First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, to the President's Committee on the Arts and 
Humanities. Committee members include such entertainment luminaries as composer 
Quincy Jones, singer-actress Rita Moreno and violinist Isaac Stern. The 
committee will be chaired by former Indiana Rep. John Brademas, who was a 
co-sponsor of the original legislation that created the committee under 
then-President Ronald Reagan in 1982. The three vice chairpeople of the 
committee, which languished under Reagan's successor George Bush, include 
Warner Bros. chairman Terry Semel, longtime Washington arts advocate Peggy 
Cooper Cafritz and Cynthia Perrin Schneider of Georgetown University. Committee 
members will have their first formal meeting with the Clintons on Wednesday.

JAZZ REVIEW; COLORFUL MONTEREY FESTIVAL CELEBRATES THE JAZZ SPECTRUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine a combination of the Renaissance Pleasure Faire, a Moroccan souk, and 
a Saturday night jam session, then place it all at the end of an airport 
runway, and it almost, but not quite, captures the atmosphere of last weekend's 
Monterey Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a colorful outdoor event at which the cooking smells from racks of 
beef, pork, chicken and catfish, the roar of jets from a nearby airport, and a 
chaotic party attitude sometimes threatened to overwhelm the sound of the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the music prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the showcase Saturday and Sunday night performers, Joe Henderson, 
Shirley Horn and Max Roach were the scene-stealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson, working within the ascetic framework of a tenor 
saxophone-bass-drums trio, had the most difficult task. Making no concessions 
to the chatty, party-oriented Saturday night crowd, he simply came out and laid 
down nearly an hour of brilliant jazz improvisation. Remarkably, by the time he 
was finished, most of the once-boisterous audience had quieted down under his 
spell. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn had an equal impact. Also working with her regular trio, she simply did 
what she does best -- redefine, with exquisite taste and subtle understatement, 
a set of familiar standards. Her readings of "The Look of Love" and "A Song for 
You" were perfect examples. Blending voice and piano into one near-symbiotic 
instrument, she transformed each song into a mini-drama, complete with 
breathtaking pauses in rhythm and sudden shifts of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Roach's percussion ensemble, M-Boom, was a revelation. All nine members played 
mallet or percussion instruments, from Roach's standard jazz drum kit to 
congas, tympani, vibes, marimba and steel pans. Their interactive pieces, which 
included straight-ahead jazz, Afro/Latin rhythms, and an unusual work in 5/4, 
were performed with the multilayered rhythms and rich timbres of African drum 
collectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Other headliners did not fare as well. Ornette Coleman has managed to bring 
threads of structure and continuity to his group, Prime Time, that have not 
been present in the past. But the ensemble's quirky assemblage of funk, rock 
and free-jazz improvising is still a far cry from the seminal music of 
Coleman's early years. Most noticeably absent in his set was his most appealing 
quality -- the ability to generate attractive, instantly recognizable melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Childs' curiously titled "Concerto for Piano and Jazz Chamber Orchestra" 
(more accurately, for jazz piano and chamber orchestra) confirmed his growing 
compositional skills. The work's Prokofiev-like second movement was the most 
attractive segment, with Childs' occasionally syrupy-sounding strings the only 
flaw in his still-growing orchestrational abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 With events taking place, often simultaneously, on three stages, it was almost 
impossible to hear everything. A selective list of the many highlights has to 
include: Saturday afternoon's marvelous blues program; Sunday afternoon's 
collection of talented high school jazz bands; the offbeat Either Orchestra 
from Boston; the easygoing mainstream jazz of the Kyle Eastwood Quartet and the 
Dottie Dodgion Trio; the hard-driving contemporary sounds of the Black/ Note 
Quintet and the David Sanchez Quartet; and the brilliant piano work of Jessica 
Williams.

THEATER REVIEW; 'HELLO, DOLLY!' LOOKIN' SWELL IN REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Andrew Lloyd Webber and rock 'n' roll changed the musical theater 
forever, "Hello, Dolly!" gave splashy, vaudeville-inspired Broadway shows their 
last hurrah. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The giddy new revival by Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities is very much 
alive with music and farce. And yet, as Jerry Herman's fabled show celebrates 
its 30th anniversary, its role as a coda to the great American musicals of the 
'40s and '50s becomes clear. To see it now is to be reminded how naively 
optimistic we once were -- or, if you prefer, how jaded and cynical we have 
become. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the folks in Redondo Beach, "dedicated to the preservation of our 
American cultural heritage," have preserved this slice of cultural heritage 
with both faith and absolute sincerity, reminding us that even seemingly 
precious art can still thrill provided it is guilelessly presented. 
</P>
<P>
 The bright ensemble, which turns each of director-choreographer Jon Engstrom's 
numbers into a kind of loud and lovely cast party, is reason enough to see this 
"Dolly," and even to overlook some lapses in singing and acting among the 
leading supporting players. Yet there are at least two more reasons -- not 
including the acrobatic waiters at the show's swank Harmonia Gardens 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 One is Karen Morrow, the veteran Broadway actress, in the title role of the 
meddlesome middle-aged matchmaker who enlivens 1890s Yonkers. A number of fine 
comic actresses have inhabited this part over the years (a national tour with 
Carol Channing is currently making the rounds), yet Morrow gives it her own 
spin. Hers is a devilish Dolly, self-aware and conniving yet wise and funny. 
</P>
<P>
 She can also belt out a song and grandstand a comedy bit with the best of 'em. 
When she attempts to distract her romantic foil, rich feed merchant Horace 
Vandergelder (the lovably grumpy Jack Ritschel), by cooing over his 
"rip-rippling muscles," Morrow turns the feint into a silly, totally unerotic 
gag at Vandergelder's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow has a lot to do with the other reason as well. For this version, 
composer Herman has restored "Love, Look in My Window," a dreamy, wistful 
ballad included in the score for Ethel Merman but left out since. Supercharged 
by Morrow's powerful set of lungs, the piece makes a fitting companion, 
musically and thematically, to the Act I finale "Before the Parade Passes By," 
a brassy echo of "76 Trombones" from "The Music Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Anne Harrison, who plays the widowed milliner Molloy, struggles a bit 
with the vocal demands of the part, and two minor roles -- Molloy's apprentice 
Minnie Fay (Shauna Markey) and Vandergelder's grown daughter (Michele Amiee 
Moore -- are overplayed as cloyingly perky and cloyingly infantile, 
respectively. Timothy Smith, playing Vandergelder's mousy clerk Cornelius, has 
a beautiful, bell-clear tenor, though, and it's put to good use throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 With revivals like this one still around, the parade will never completely 
pass by Herman's last of the Broadway legends. 
</P>

TV REVIEW; ABC'S 'THE BOYS': A CURIOUS HYBRID OF A FAMILY SITCOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most distinguishing trait of the new ABC comedy series "Me and the Boys" 
is its grammar. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is African American Steve Tower, a Dallas video store owner with three 
sons, expressing his lighthearted skepticism about the vision of God: "It ain't 
written nowhere dat God ain't all the time just bumpin' in all the stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that some Americans don't speak this way, only that most who do in 
prime-time entertainment programs happen to be black -- a stereotype if there 
ever was one. 
</P>
<P>
 While likable enough, the upper middle-class Tower household is also a curious 
hybrid, consisting of the street-talking Tower (stand-up comic Steve Harvey), 
his three relatively well-spoken sons, ages 10 to 16, and his refined 
mother-in-law, Mary (Madge Sinclair). These characters are introduced in a 
premiere that is mildly funny at best, as William (Wayne Collins) and Artis 
(Chaz Lamar Shepherd) get in trouble with their caring, education-promoting, 
disciplinarian dad over attending a horror movie.  
</P>
<P>
 "I figure if I give 'em enough trouble (at home), they won't have to go out 
lookin' for none," Steve says. 
</P>
<P>
 At his best, Harvey is faintly reminiscent of Richard Pryor. At his worst, he 
appears stiffly out of sync in this environment, even though "Me and the Boys" 
at times is more of an extended monologue than a sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Me and the Boys" premieres at 8:30 tonight on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42).

 GOOD SIGN: Heather Whitestone won more than the Miss America Pageant on 
Saturday. As the first deaf woman to wear the crown, she proved "deaf people 
can succeed in the same way anyone else can," says Evelyn J. Cederbaum, 
associate director of CSUN's National Center on Deafness. . . . CSUN junior 
Erika Dickson placed second this year in the Miss Deaf America contest.

 SCHOOL'S OUT: More than 60 children from a Lancaster grade school went to 
hospitals complaining of nausea from fumes, none seriously hurt. One 
explanation was that old standby -- fireworks in the boy's bathroom (B1). . . . 
But no firecracker debris was found and paramedics figure much of the problem 
was psychosomatic, children getting sick because their friends were. The 
principal's talking expulsion, but isn't sure who. 
</P>
<P>
 CARS: The '90s started off poorly for car dealers in the Valley -- they were 
about as busy as Maytag repairmen. No longer. Business is booming at local 
dealerships (above), and it may not slow down for some time (Valley Business, 
Page 3). . . . "We can't keep the cars on the ground," says a Canoga Park Jeep 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER APPROACH: Home schooling gets a good grade from many parents tired of 
the traditional choices in education. Take the Lenox family in Van Nuys, who 
educate their daughter, Skylar, 7, with art classes from a museum, piano 
lessons from a tutor, and reading sessions at the library (E1). . . . "I want 
her to retain her love of learning," said her mother, Marsha. Michael Arkush

telephone, he keeps in touch with auto executives nationwide. . . . "Besides 
the electronic commuting, I log 75,000 to 100,000 miles a year on planes,

GETTING OUT ALIVE, BEARLY; NEIGHBORHOOD RALLIES TO SAVE THE LIFE OF ANIMAL 
CAPTURED AFTER ROAMING THE BACK YARDS OF MONROVIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA O'NEILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All summer, residents of Norumbega Drive in Monrovia watched "Samson" roam the 
neighborhood, frolicking in their pools and spas, eating avocados from their 
trees and even hamming it up for video cameras -- though they knew enough to 
keep their distance from the 400-pound California black bear. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the neighborhood mobilized to plead for a "stay of execution" for 
their uninvited guest, who finally was captured by state game wardens over the 
weekend and was scheduled to be euthanized at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Monrovia city officials and state Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) 
called on the California Department of Fish and Game to relocate Samson to the 
remote wilderness instead. Monrovia Mayor Robert T. Bartlett wrote the official 
with the power to grant executive clemency -- Gov. Pete Wilson -- urging him to 
intervene and "stop this scheduled execution." 
</P>
<P>
 It worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson wrote to Fish and Game Director Boyd Gibbons urging him to explore "all 
reasonable alternatives" for the friendly -- and toothless -- animal. "This 
bear has captured the imagination of well-wishers throughout the state," Wilson 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday afternoon, Fish and Game spokesman Patrick Moore announced that the 
bear would not be destroyed and was being held at an undisclosed location for 
medical evaluation. But because Samson had made himself a little too much at 
home in a populated area -- where he posed a threat to humans -- his next 
destination will probably be some form of captivity, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt very much they're going to turn it loose," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore said the public outcry contributed to the decision not to destroy the 
bear, which had been spotted as recently as Friday night frolicking for two 
hours in the Norumbega Drive back yard of Bonnie Forte. 
</P>
<P>
 Forte said she did not bother Samson and the bear did not bother her. "He's 
not endangering anyone's life," noted the resident of the foothill community, 
who was considering making "Save Samson" T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking for a stay of execution," said Craig Bonholtzer, who founded the 
San Gabriel Mountains Bear and Wildlife Preservation Society after Azusa police 
shot and killed a bear that wandered onto residential streets on May 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to see a repeat of the Azusa incident," Bonholtzer said, adding 
that his group has the funds to cover the cost of relocating Samson. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy, who has lived near the foothills for more than 30 years, said he has 
had his own back-yard encounters with bears, coyotes, raccoons and other 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget," he said, "we moved into their country. They didn't move into 
ours."

 Three rings and it's out: Prosecutor Marcia Clark was at the lectern, arguing 
a legal point in the O.J. Simpson case, when she was interrupted by a ringing 
noise. She looked over at Simpson defense attorney Robert Shapiro and asked, 
"Is that counsel's phone?" As Shapiro attempted to shut the thing off, Superior 
Court Judge Lance Ito said, "That's twice, Mr. Shapiro," referring to a similar 
ringing episode of a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito added: "Next time, it's mine."

 The baseball strike is peanuts to them: Dodger Stadium season ticket-holders 
aren't the only fans who have some strike refunds coming to them. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also the season peanut-holders. Those are the dozen customers of 
celebrity vendor Roger Owens, who shell out $202.50 to have two bags of peanuts 
thrown their way at every home game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sending out the checks this week," Owens said. "Normally, I'd tell them 
they have a credit for the '95 season. But the way baseball people are talking, 
the '95 season may not get started until June or July, if then." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some ballplayers, Owens has been striving to keep his throwing arm in 
shape, demonstrating his behind-the-back style at a trade show, a car dealer's 
opening, a real estate agents meeting and a circus in recent weeks.

 Leave the jokes to us, Harvey: Looking over the mis-addressed mail that lands 
on our desk we sometimes think the co-authors of this column are ex-Dodger 
Steve Garvey and commentator Paul Harvey. We always answer their mail, though. 
In fact, we've been involved in a months-long debate over health care with an 
Oklahoma man who thinks we're Paul Harvey and can't understand why our position 
seems a little liberal for a rock-ribbed conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Now things could get even more complicated. We won't even be sure that mail 
bearing our name will be intended for us. ABC is debuting a new show, "Me and 
the Boys," starring "stand-up comic Steve Harvey." We wish him luck. And a 
share of our health-care mail. miscelLAny The sounds of Dodger baseball aren't 
quite mute. Nancy Hefley, the Dodger Stadium organist, is currently performing 
at the horse shows at the L.A. County Fair. Don't think she does "Charge!" 
there, though.

LAPD'S NEW OUTREACH TO THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Christopher Commission released its landmark report on the Los 
Angeles Police Department in July, 1991, near the top of its list of principal 
recommendations was adoption of "the 'community-based policing' model, 
emphasizing service to the public and prevention of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, established in the wake of the Rodney King beating, had good reason 
to set such a high priority on community policing.Too many officers viewed 
elements of the public with resentment and hostility and too many citizens saw 
all police officers as callous or even inhumane. In large part, these attitudes 
had become entrenched because of failures of basic communication within the 
department and between the LAPD and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is an opportunity to rectify that sorry situation, thanks to several 
innovative programs. One such effort, directed by the department's Community 
Police Academy, is a 30-hour course designed to familiarize city residents with 
police operations.  
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday the first class completed its training, and officials are hoping 
the graduates will help put an end to misconceptions about police. They also 
are hoping to expand the program by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Community-based policing is not new. In the 1970s, the department experimented 
with neighborhood watch programs and assigning officers to particular 
neighborhoods. This sort of program worked then, and can be made to work again. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The current controversies surrounding LAPD administrative shake-ups 
notwithstanding, police officials must never lose sight of the importance of 
keeping community-based policing a top priority.

NOW THAT WE'RE IN, HOW WILL WE GET OUT?; AMERICA PLUNGES INTO THE ABYSS OF YET 
ANOTHER FAILED NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the short run, what is happening now in Haiti could have worked out far, 
far worse. As retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, a former chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, put it Monday, it's awfully good not to see young Haitian 
soldiers and young American soldiers shooting one another. However, in the long 
run, it is not at all clear whether America's Haiti adventure will have a 
satisfying conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The international political system has been spawning one failed national 
society after another. Haiti follows Somalia and before long surely another 
country will implode. The question for the international community is to what 
extent it can afford to ignore such collapses; the challenge for the United 
States is to be careful and modest about rushing in with the Marines, Air 
Force, Army or Navy, pursuing well-intentioned but misguided notions that we 
can fix everyone's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton virtually talked himself -- and practically no one else, by 
the way -- into invading Haiti; to our eyes he had gone too far out on the 
limb. Former President Jimmy Carter, Gen. Powell and Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), 
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee -- with the sure might of U.S. 
firepower behind them -- managed to spare both Americans and Haitians an 
invasion that even the President himself very much wanted to avoid. Perhaps 
many lives on both sides were saved. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal struck with the Haitian junta has worrisome holes in it, but it did 
have the singular and honorable virtue of letting thousands of U.S. and 
multinational troops into the island nation without a shot being fired. But 
now, having put ourselves there, under what circumstances do we get out? 
</P>
<P>
 The limits of American capabilities must be kept in mind as the United States 
blithely embarks on nation-building. Grenada and perhaps even Panama, with its 
growing economy, are arguably better off than if the United States had never 
gotten involved militarily, but they both are more of a testament to the adage 
"better to be lucky than good" than to a well-thought-out entrance-and-exit 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti's Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and company are to step down Oct. 15 and may or 
may not leave the country. Even if they do depart they will leave virtually 
intact the structure of an often brutal military, not to mention the secret and 
semi-clandestine police groups and other forces that have been historical 
instruments of repression. It's important to note that the Haitian military 
does not operate in a vacuum; it typically has been used as a guard of the 
status quo by that nation's privileged economic elite. Thus we doubt that 
well-meaning lectures about democracy by Americans are going to root deeply in 
Haitian soil. More likely is that by allowing these repressive structures to 
remain, the Clinton Administration may merely have allowed the dragon seeds to 
be planted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration was right to strive to avoid shooting its way in, even 
though there was never doubt that an invasion could be militarily successful. 
In fact, we feared that a military success, especially a relatively easy one, 
might blind Americans to the enormity of what the United States had gotten 
itself into. The question now is: How quickly can U.S. military involvement 
end? 
</P>
<P>
 Critics such as activist Randall Robinson of TransAfrica -- a well-respected 
lobbying organization on African and Caribbean issues -- think the 
Administration got very little in concessions from Cedras, considering the 
military bargaining power the United States brought to the table; that may be 
true. But the larger issue for U.S. foreign policy may be whether Washington 
too often overestimates its ability to stitch together a broken-down society 
like Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the troops are there now and before long 15,000 Americans will 
be on the Haitian part of the island of Hispaniola, shared with the Dominican 
Republic. They deserve our support. So does the President, who recommended the 
U.S. intervention not for craven reasons of acquisition or aggression or 
plunder. The key to keeping the Haiti operation from becoming a long and 
tedious march to terminal frustration is to establish limited, achievable 
goals: (1) the starting of the processes of democracy; (2) the true ending of 
military rule; (3) last but far from least, getting out of there sooner rather 
than later.

RAIL PROJECT: SKIES ARE CLEARING; VITALLY NEEDED UPGRADE OF ALAMEDA CORRIDOR 
SURMOUNTS MAJOR PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reports that Gov. Pete Wilson and his gubernatorial challenger, state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, each are vowing they will free up state funds for the 
Alameda Corridor -- and even are bickering over who should get the most credit 
for supporting the project -- have all but overwhelmed the truly good news 
regarding this mammoth rail project. Earlier this month four cities along the 
rail route dropped the lawsuit they had filed against the Port of Long Beach, a 
suit that temporarily stopped the project cold. 
</P>
<P>
 The corridor project, expected to cost $1.8 billion ultimately, would provide 
a high-speed rail link for freight between Downtown Los Angeles and the 
adjacent ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. It now takes freight trains as 
long as eight hours to travel the route; they crawl along at 5 m.p.h. as they 
cross 34 congested streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Completion of the rail link, in which the track would be below street level 
for much of the way, is absolutely essential to the continued national 
dominance of the two ports and hence to the long-term economic viability of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 As obvious as the need for this project is, the path has been littered with 
disputes and disagreements. One formidable problem was that the three railroads 
that own the existing routes could not reach accord on sharing the upgraded 
line. After years of negotiation, broad terms finally were agreed to; the 
completed agreement could be signed by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 When that happens, the state can tap into $80 million in bond funds reserved 
for the project as part of Proposition 116, which voters passed in 1990. 
Whoever wins the gubernatorial election must formally request authorization of 
this spending from the state Transportation Commission and Caltrans.  
</P>
<P>
 Another potential obstacle had been the lawsuit filed by Compton, Lynwood, 
South Gate and Vernon. The suit alleged that the Port of Long Beach's planned 
port improvements, unrelated to the corridor, would significantly increase 
truck and train traffic in those cities.  
</P>
<P>
 The suit prompted the Port of Long Beach to pull out of the corridor project, 
effectively bringing it to a halt for nearly a month. But port officials, by 
recently agreeing to an addition to the environmental impact report for the 
project, made an important gesture toward allaying the cities' traffic fears. 
In return, the four cities tentatively agreed to drop their lawsuit, paving the 
way for the Port of Long Beach to rejoin the project. 
</P>
<P>
 For too long the Alameda Corridor has been the one local infrastructure 
improvement project that nearly everyone wanted but which no one seemed to be 
able to move forward. Perhaps, now, real progress is at hand.

VATICAN POLITICS AND POPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Papal Politics" by Martin E. Marty, Opinion, Sept. 11: 
</P>
<P>
 Marty is right, the Pope played hardball. Unfortunately we played softball. 
However, Marty needs to take his thinking one step farther. The Pope has no 
more right being a major spokesperson at the population conference than would a 
mayor from Tahiti being a major spokesperson at a Vatican Ecumenical Council. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a conference of states, not of religions. As such, the Pope 
represents the Vatican, a state with a few thousand people, mostly men. He 
doesn't represent the millions of Catholics around the world. They are 
represented by their heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore was far too willing to compromise with the Pope. He 
would have been within his right to say to the Pope, "You don't represent the 
millions of Catholics in the U.S. I do. I am representing their views more 
accurately than you do. Most of the Catholics strongly disagree with your 
views." Gore, of course, could have said that diplomatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore would have been much wiser politically to have challenged the Pope. Gore 
is a family man. Gore did sacrifice a run for the White House when his son 
needed him. He is, in my opinion, a much more moral man than most who are in 
Washington or even in the Vatican. Only someone like Gore could have pointed 
out the absurdity of the Pope dominating a political conference on population. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore is too much of a gentleman to have done so. 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD FOY 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Marty accuses the Vatican of throwing "Cairo off course." Through the draft 
program of action, the Clinton Administration (Vice President Gore, 
Undersecretary Tim Wirth) and their allies have attempted to throw Third World 
development off course. At the Cairo conference the Catholic representatives 
have objected most strongly to: 
</P>
<P>
 * The redefinition of abortion as health care and a form of family planning. 
</P>
<P>
 * The redefinition of family to include homosexual relationships (to the 
detriment of children). 
</P>
<P>
 * The corrupting of youth morality by Planned Parenthood-type sex education. 
</P>
<P>
 With such significant issues on the table, it is to the credit of the Catholic 
community that the Vatican did not cave in after continual attacks like that of 
Marty. It is also a compliment to the Vatican that Marty's attack was more 
personal than substantive. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the draft program for action that shifted emphasis from development 
toward radical social engineering. It has been the U.S. contingency and its 
allies that have stonewalled on clarifying terms, refused to admit they are 
breaking with previous development conferences on abortion and hidden behind 
euphemisms. 
</P>
<P>
 What the U.S. delegation, the draft program for action and the Cairo 
Conference have refused to acknowledge is that the major cause of poverty and 
suffering is not population growth, but poor political and economic policies. 
The former communist world has long had the highest rates of abortion. Where is 
their prosperity and development? Lower fertility rates do not lead to 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociology has shown conclusively that the traditional family is the foundation 
on which any healthy society must build.  
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican has exposed to the world the deceits hidden in the euphemisms of 
the draft program for action. In the midst of the uproar, the attacks and the 
criticism, I am proud that the Catholic community has taken this heroic stand. 
</P>
<P>
 THE REV. THOMAS J. BURDICK 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman, Respect Life Committee 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino Diocese 
</P>
<P>
 * I disagree with Marty's accusation that the Pope is being political. The 
fact that the killing of pre-born babies has become a political issue is of no 
concern to the Pope. He is simply reaffirming God's fifth commandment: "Thou 
shalt not kill." 
</P>
<P>
 BARBARA D. KENT-BELROY 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 * There can be no real improvement in the lives of many people without the 
increased use of artificial methods of birth control to curb the number of 
babies born on this planet with no food, no shelter and no hope. The Pope is 
kidding himself if he thinks otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 JUDY DANIELS 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 * So the malcontent Malthusians who roam the corridors of the U.N. and the 
White House, both of which already consider themselves the world government, 
have got $17 billion with which to enforce our "reproductive rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Quite apart from forwarding a theory long discredited and without scientific 
foundation, the real question of Cairo is not about women's rights, the power 
of the Vatican or legal abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 It is about surrendering a basic individual freedom to a government. Letting 
them into your bedroom, in essence. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest you consider this overly Orwellian, ponder this: Who will be the 
overpopulator? You? Me? Or will it be the person who doesn't agree?

GOMPERS QUOTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your Sept. 5 column, "Labor Landmarks," inaccurately quotes Samuel Gompers. 
This common error gives a false and very negative impression of the goals and 
purpose of the entire union movement in the United States.It should be 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the article, "Gompers always summed up what he wanted for his 
union members as 'more.' " If I recall correctly, that "quote" was a reporter's 
one-word synopsis of Gompers' response to the question, "What does labor want?" 
Gompers' actual reply:  
</P>
<P>
 "We want more schoolhouses and less jails; more books and less arsenals; more 
learning and less vice; more constant work and less crime; more leisure and 
less greed; more justice and less revenge; in fact, more opportunities to 
cultivate our best natures, to make manhood more noble, womanhood more 
beautiful, and childhood more happy and bright." 
</P>
<P>
 Gompers' sentiments continue to be a worthy goal for organized labor and for 
this nation.

VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am a retired craftsman who returned to a community college to train 
students in an occupation that treated me well for close to four decades. I did 
not complete my baccalaureate and master's degrees until I returned to teaching 
-- I did not need them to be a competent tradesman and businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 While the steps reported in "Schools Tackling Job Training Needs" (Sept. 6) 
are at least a start, I note some very necessary prerequisites. Every student 
should be getting at least an introductory technological course as early as 
possible. Math courses can be made desirable if the math is relevant, and by 
relevant I am not referring to some of the nonsensical examples I have seen in 
my children's and my granddaughter's classes. I also did not see the return of 
the traditional trade school where as a student I received my first two years' 
apprenticeship training. The problem seems to be that parents shudder at the 
thought of their child going to a vocational school. 
</P>
<P>
 What I found missing in the proposed program, and find missing in many of my 
younger students, is the simple lessons they should have been taught at home. 
Too many young persons have little or no work ethic to put out an "honest 
eight." They have no idea what I'm talking about when I cajole them to use 
their time wisely. But most of all, they are not willing to make any kind of a 
sacrifice that may interfere in their personal pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 If educators follow the current unsuccessful mode, using the excuse that the 
state mandates a particular procedure, this program too will be just another 
empty promise to too many students who are at the low end of priorities by even 
their own parents.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A SHARP LOOKOUT EVERYWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The contentious 69th Assembly District in northern Orange County has a history 
of political shenanigans. Once again, with the seat open in the November 
election, concern about the voting process has come up, although to date much 
of it seems unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Garden Grove), who represents a 
nearby district, claimed the voting rolls of the 69th contained phony names. 
County Democrats denied committing any voter fraud, and the county registrar of 
voters, who rightly and quickly investigated, said he found no evidence that 
fraudulent ballots had been cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Conroy called for "volunteer poll watchers" at some precincts in the 
district in the coming election. That prompted the county chapter of the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund to denounce Conroy and to 
request that U.S. Justice Department monitors be present for the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer poll watchers might satisfy Conroy but because they cannot 
challenge voters directly it is difficult to see what they would prove to 
anyone else. Six years ago Republicans stationed uniformed guards at the polls 
in what Latinos said was an attempt to intimidate them to keep them from 
voting. The party used the flimsy excuse of merely trying to keep non-citizens 
from the polls and ended up paying more than $400,000 to settle lawsuits 
stemming from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The specifics of the present case aside, voter fraud is a serious matter. And 
the political flap is a reminder that as Election Day nears, the registrar of 
voters should keep a sharp lookout everywhere.

OVERTIME KICK ENDS COWBOYS' WINNING STREAK; PRO FOOTBALL: HANSON'S 44-YARD 
FIELD GOAL WITH 27 SECONDS TO PLAY IN EXTRA PERIOD GIVES LIONS A 20-17 VICTORY.

 Jason Hanson, who had two kicks blocked by Leon Lett late in the game, made a 
44-yard field goal with 27 seconds to play in overtime Monday night to give the 
Detroit Lions a 20-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, ending the Cowboys' 
10-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I hit the game-winner well," Hanson said. "I wanted a second chance 
after what had happened. I finally got lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first loss for the Super Bowl champions since last Thanksgiving, 
when a blunder by Lett on a blocked field-goal attempt allowed the Miami 
Dolphins to win in the snow at Texas Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second overtime field goal of the season for Hanson, who had a 
37-yarder against the Atlanta Falcons in the Lions' opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit got the ball back with 1:55 to play in overtime when Pat Swilling 
sacked Troy Aikman and Broderick Thomas recovered a fumble -- the second for 
Dallas in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 17-yard pass to Brett Perriman and three unsuccessful running plays, 
Hanson put the winner just inside the right goal post. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Sanders rushed 40 times for 194 yards and Emmitt Smith carried 29 times 
for 143 yards in a matchup of two of the NFL's most prolific backs. "Everybody 
has to have their bad days and this was one of our worst," Smith said. "We 
executed very poorly. We should know better. We just didn't have anything 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sanders: "It's a long season but this will be a game to remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders passed the 7,000-mark in career rushing yards in the second quarter. 
Smith passed the 6,000-yard mark later in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Mitchell connected on 13 of 27 passes for 127 yards and two touchdowns, 
and Aikman completed 26 of 39 for 223 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, though, it came down to Detroit's kicking game and Lett's 
outstretched arms. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of regulation, Hanson's 57-yard attempt was blocked by Lett, and 
the lineman knocked down a 51-yard attempt 5 1/2 minutes into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lett was not in position to block the winner as the ball sailed over the 
other end of the Cowboys' defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 A tie game would have been the NFL's first since 1989, when Cleveland and 
Kansas City finished 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the loss was Barry Switzer's first as coach of the Cowboys and kept 
Lett from finally being a hero. The lineman is best known for fumbling away a 
sure touchdown in the 1993 Super Bowl and his gaffe against Miami last 
Thanksgiving when he touched a blocked kick instead of leaving it alone. Lett 
didn't maintain control of the ball, Miami recovered and kicked a field goal to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys trailed for most of the game, but they overcame a 10-point deficit 
and tied the score at 17-17 with 4:09 to play in regulation on Smith's six-yard 
touchdown run to cap 59-yard drive. The drive started at the Dallas 41 after 
Hanson missed from 51 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell burned the Cowboys with two clutch passes to Herman Moore that helped 
the Lions open a 17-7 lead midway through the third quarter. Mitchell hit Moore 
with a 25-yard pass on fourth and three from the Dallas 36, then connected with 
him on a nine-yard touchdown pass on third and nine.

 Chuck Bednarik of the Philadelphia Eagles was a rare breed of player as he 
wound up his NFL career in the early 1960s. He played both ways -- center on 
offense, linebacker on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Ray Didinger of Knight-Ridder newspapers, Bednarik 
recently said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the end of an era. No NFL player could do it today. These guys play 
three or four plays and come off sucking air.

 A medical examiner in Southampton, N.Y., said an autopsy on former tennis star 
Vitas Gerulaitis had not yielded a cause of death and that further 
toxicological tests were being done. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerulaitis' body was found Sunday in the guest cottage of an oceanfront 
estate. He was lying on the bed, fully clothed. Police said there were no sign 
of drugs or crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerulaitis' host was developer Martin Raynes, a longtime friend. Both men were 
fixtures on the Manhattan party circuit in the '70s and Gerulaitis was a 
frequent guest at Raynes' cottage, police said.

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; LUNCHEON POSTPONED BY NHL LABOR DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mighty Duck players took a small action in the NHL's labor dispute Monday 
after a two-hour meeting with NHL Players Assn. chief Bob Goodenow, who 
informed club management that players won't attend an Anaheim Chamber of 
Commerce luncheon in their honor Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber of Commerce officials quickly moved to postpone the $40-a-plate event 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow has told the NHL's 26 teams that players won't make public 
appearances -- except for some charities -- while the threat of a lockout 
looms. The decision is a reaction to a series of unilateral rule changes by NHL 
Commissioner Gary Bettman on Sept. 1 that included the elimination of per diem 
meal expenses and training camp transportation expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing we want to do is ruffle any feathers around here because of 
the (positive) way we've been treated here," said center Bob Corkum, the Ducks' 
player representative. "But the cold, hard fact is it's a business. This is a 
war, and the war started with the (elimination of compensation for) training 
camp meals and flights. This is something we're doing to fight back." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Tavares, president of Disney Sports Enterprises, called the decision 
"ill-advised," and said, "all they're doing is distancing themselves from the 
community. This doesn't hurt the Mighty Ducks (organization) economically." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Duck players are skipping the chamber of commerce luncheon -- a 
function similar to those with the Rams and Angels that raises funds for the 
group's operating budget -- they have not backed out of an Oct. 10 golf outing 
that benefits Disney GOALS, a Walt Disney Co. program for underprivileged 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Left wing Stu Grimson joked that perhaps players are more eager to play golf, 
but said, "we're trying to treat charities with a little more concern. They are 
not part of this labor dispute." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cam Neely, Adam Oates, Ray Bourque and former Duck Alexei Kasatonov are among 
the players the Boston Bruins are bringing for exhibition games against the 
Ducks at 7:30 tonight at The Pond of Anaheim and at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at the 
San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oleg Tverdovsky, the second overall pick in the June draft, has had a quiet 
camp -- partly because of Paul Kariya's debut and partly because of a groin 
injury that has kept him from appearing in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been great for him to get experience in an exhibition game 
where if you make a mistake it doesn't cost you," Coach Ron Wilson said. "His 
first action will be in a real game the way it looks right now." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Boston games, the Ducks play Friday against Dallas and Sunday 
against Pittsburgh -- both in Anaheim -- before the scheduled season-opener 
Oct. 1 at Dallas.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The topic on the table is the San Diego Chargers' surprising start. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "They're for real," Lee Hamilton said about one of only four unbeaten teams in 
the NFL. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton is the Chargers' play-by-play radio announcer, but also the outspoken 
host of a talk show on XTRA and always tells it the way he believes it is. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best-balanced team, offensively and defensively, in the AFC 
West," he said. "They're throwing deep, shoving the ball down people's throats 
on the ground, and getting all kinds of turnovers and sacks." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On the way to their first 3-0 start since 1981, the Chargers have won division 
games on the road at Denver and Seattle and will play another Sunday against 
the Raiders at the Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I told people at the start of the season that this franchise would be good," 
Hamilton said. "I thought they had the potential to be 10-6. I'll hold to 
that." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In Bobby Ross' first year as coach, 1992, they won 11 of their last 12 games 
and finished 11-5. In 1993, they slipped to 8-8. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was an aberration," Hamilton said. "The year before, they had one 
major injury. Last year, they had 11. They played a first-place schedule and 
five of their losses were by a touchdown or less. They had an injured 
quarterback." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The coach, Ross, quickly has regained respect in San Diego, where capacity 
crowds are expected at Jack Murphy Stadium for the rest of the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby is a demanding guy who accepts nothing but perfection in practice," 
Hamilton said. "Game days are easier for the Chargers than practice days. He 
keeps hammering them. His team doesn't believe it has accomplished anything 
yet." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In three games, the Chargers have thrown opponents for losses or held them to 
no gain 27 times. On Sunday, Leslie O'Neal sacked Rick Mirer three times, which 
was twice more than the Raiders got to him a week earlier. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "They're blitzing from everywhere, which they've never done before under 
(defensive coordinator Bill) Arnsparger," Hamilton said. "That forces a lot of 
turnovers. Of course, this is a gambling defense and it has a propensity to 
give up big yardage on third-down plays." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback, Stan Humphries, is well and delivering bombs after having 
been bothered by a bad shoulder last season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Humphries is the equal to Jeff Hostetler," Hamilton said. "He's mobile, 
tough, fiery and has a gun for an arm. The Chargers went through 17 
quarterbacks trying to find a replacement for Dan Fouts. They went to Canada, 
the unemployment line, and the draft. Then they stole one from Washington." . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a nice matchup Sunday at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It should be awesome," Hamilton said. "The Raiders are a lot of fun to watch 
on offense. The Chargers would convince a lot of people they're for real with 
another win on the road." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How strange it is to find a Bill Parcells-coached team, the New England 
Patriots, leading the NFL in points scored and next to last in points allowed. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame is the only football team among the big three in the state of 
Indiana that isn't unbeaten. Of course, the Irish haven't had the opportunity 
to play Cincinnati and Miami of Ohio, like Indiana, or Toledo and Ball State, 
like Purdue. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he has reacted to Nebraska winters, Brenden Stai, the Cornhusker 
senior guard from Yorba Linda, said, "It hasn't been bad. They used to call me 
'Polar Bear' in California because I swam in the ocean in the winter." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The way the Oilers and Cougars are going, Houston must miss the Astros. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Loyd, a 6-foot-1 point guard from Oklahoma who reportedly is in the 
Mark Price mold, has made an unwritten commitment to UCLA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Best confrontation in the Breeders' Cup on Nov. 5 at Churchill Downs might be 
between Ron McAnally's Call Now and Wayne Lukas' Flanders in the Juvenile 
Fillies. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Yonex U.S. Badminton Open will be played this weekend at Pauley Pavilion. 
Did you know that badminton is the world's fastest racket sport and that the 
shuttlecocks reach speeds of more than 200 m.p.h.? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bruce McNall's home in Bel Air has been put up for sale. The asking price is 
$5,590,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It should have come as no surprise that Sports Illustrated left such obvious 
choices as Willie Mays and Wilt Chamberlain off its list of the 40 most 
influential people in sports the past 40 years. The more controversial the 
choices, the more attention they receive. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I wonder who would dominate a scrimmage between the Arizona Cardinals' offense 
and the Denver Broncos' defense.

 Saladin McCullough, the All-CIF running back from Pasadena Muir High who in 
1993 signed a letter of intent to attend USC, is lighting up junior college 
football for Pasadena City College.  
</P>
<P>
 After two games, his coach, Dennis Gossard, said of him Monday: "There is no 
better runner in college football, at any level, than this kid.He's a great 
back, he's going to get better and he still wants to play for SC." 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough, 5-9 and 175 pounds, has more than 500 yards total offense in two 
games. Saturday against Golden West he had 255 combined yards. He also had a 
70-yard touchdown run called back. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough sat out last year while his Scholastic Aptitude Test score was 
challenged. He lost his case in arbitration. EARL GUSTKEY

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: FIEGE DEFENDS THE PENALTIES IN SYLMAR CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Punishing a team or coach for admitted rule breaking is not as easy as it 
might seem. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Barbara Fiege, the City Section commissioner who has spent much of the 
last week explaining why the Sylmar High football team received only probation 
for holding an illegal scrimmage last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think if you don't do something drastic for breaking the rules that 
it's only a slap on the wrist," said Fiege, who is finishing her first year as 
the section's first female commissioner. "But you have to know all the facts 
before coming to that conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 The facts are that Sylmar, which won a section title in 1992, conducted a 
passing scrimmage against Pierce College in Woodland Hills on Aug. 9, violating 
two section rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jeff Engilman said he had been unaware that it was a violation to hold a 
scrimmage after Aug. 1 or that it was against the rules to use in scrimmages 
players who do not meet the CIF's age requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters was that Sylmar was on probation last fall for holding an 
illegal practice over the Labor Day holiday. Many area coaches said two 
violations in one year warranted a stiffer punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Rules Committee reviewed the testimony and put Sylmar on two years' 
probation and penalized the team the loss of two practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message to me is that you are going to get two or three probations before 
anything happens to you," said Joel Schaeffer, Reseda's football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said two years' probation is more than a slap on the wrist. She also 
noted that Engilman had been punished by his own administration, although the 
school has not revealed the nature of that punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may say the City doesn't have the guts to punish anyone, but I don't 
think that's true," Fiege said. "You just have to be consistent with what you 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar was not the only football team put on probation last week. Locke was 
put on for a year for allegedly recruiting players from the Fremont district. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont coaches initiated the charges and several of their players testified 
that they had been contacted by coaches from Locke. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll continue to investigate charges of recruiting," Fiege said. "We let 
both sides present their case and review the facts and testimony." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is no City Section football record book, but if there was, Di-Onte Smith 
of Van Nuys Grant would certainly have earned himself a spot in it last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior running back rushed for 352 yards in 19 carries and scored three 
touchdowns in a 20-15 nonconference victory over visiting Marshall. Smith, 5-10 
and 180 pounds, scored on runs of 79, 98, and 69 yards. He had 208 yards in 
eight carries at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's previous best was 225 yards and three touchdowns against Belmont last 
year. He gained 143 yards in a 15-15 tie against Verdugo Hills in the opener 
Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bloomington's football team has outscored opponents this season, 170-8. What 
makes the statistic even more impressive is that the Bruins have played only 
two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not uncomfortable with how big we've been winning because the kids are 
just out there doing their thing and not taking cheap shots," said Don Markham, 
Bloomington's first-year coach. "We have things under control." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington opened with an 86-8 victory at Big Bear on Sept. 10, then beat 
Notre Dame last Friday at Riverside Community College, 84-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Markham installed a double-wing offense, which relies primarily on senior 
backs Cheyane Caldwell and Greg Oliver. Quarterback Jason Buell has thrown only 
eight passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We run sort of a USC sweep-type offense," said Markham, 55, who won a 
Southern Section title in 1978 while coaching at Colton. "We only run a few 
plays, so if the defense can't stop us, the score can get sort of high." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, 1-9 last season, compete in the Southern Section's Sunkist League. 
The school is 60 miles east of downtown Los Angeles near Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be another lopsided victory Friday night when Bloomington plays host 
to Hemet West Valley, which has been outscored, 116-0. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback controversy continues at Westlake, where Coach Jim Benkert is 
still trying to pick a starter from three candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Benkert had planned to alternate the three prospects in Friday's game against 
Ventura but abandoned the plan when starter Steve Spruill performed so well. 
Spruill, a senior, left midway through the fourth quarter after passing for 289 
yards and three touchdowns in a 52-26 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 He was replaced by Brian Shubin, a senior transfer from Woodland Hills Taft 
who completed five of seven passes for 47 yards and a touchdown. Junior Steve 
Aylsworth started on defense but did not take any snaps. Times' Top 20 Football

 Horace Grant, his first contract with the Orlando Magic struck down by the 
NBA, signed with the Magic for five years in a deal already approved by the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-10 free-agent power forward played the last seven years with the 
Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, with a two-year, early release option clause, was signed exactly 
a week after a federal judge in Newark, N.J., ruled Grant's first offer from 
the franchise -- a $22.3-million contract with a one-year escape clause -- 
could violate the NBA salary cap. Details of the new contract weren't 
disclosed.

 The New York Mets eliminated more than one-third of their administrative

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; NOW FRANZEN SEES FORWARDS IN A DIFFERENT 
LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kim Franzen used to think forwards were a bunch of prima donnas. Soccer's 
version of the designated hitter, they're players who get the most glory with 
the least amount of effort, only breaking a sweat while celebrating goals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Franzen, who started 19 of 20 games last year as an outside defender, got 
a new job when Marine Cano became the women's coach this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And now she is going to have to work on running in circles with her arms 
extended toward the heavens. All of sudden, Franzen is a forward. When she hit 
the back of the net in the Anteaters' opener, Sept. 4 against Cal State 
Hayward, it was the first goal she had scored in three years, since she was a 
center midfielder at Palomar College in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'My God, I scored,' " she said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 After five games, she's tied with freshman Tracie Manz for the team scoring 
lead with three goals for six points. She scored the winning goal Saturday 
during the Anteaters' 1-0 overtime victory over Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having the most fun I've had playing soccer in a while," she said. "But 
it's been a lot of work. The transition hasn't been easy at all. I certainly 
never realized how much effort it takes to play forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "On defense, the challenge is right there in front of you, to keep people away 
from the goal. But being on the other end when you have to keep working to get 
open and trying to score, takes a lot of effort." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no closed-door sessions with Cano before the season to discuss a 
position switch. In fact, Franzen didn't know she was moving on up until the 
first day of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got here and started evaluating players, I was looking for skillful 
players with a touch of magic," Cano said. "We didn't have enough goal scorers 
-- still don't -- and Kim Franzen was one of the players I identified has 
having the skill to play my style." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano has four criteria when picking forwards to play in his aggressive, 
counter-attacking scheme: They have to be able to hold the ball; take on 
defenders with the ball; set up scores, and score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," Franzen said. "I just had no idea I would be playing forward. 
I guess it's because I've got some speed and he wanted some speed up front. I 
just figured he thought it was best for the team and I would try my best." 
</P>
<P>
 That's all Cano is demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Kim has been pushed like this before," Cano said, "but I'm 
pushing her now. She's a senior and she should be thinking about the 
All-Western region team. She certainly has the potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Franzen also was a key player in former Coach Ray Smith's game plan. The 
Anteaters were 12-8 last season, tying the school record for most victories in 
a season, and they were doing it with defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this aggressive style a lot better because I'm more used to it," she 
said. "I think we're all working really hard this year to make it work. And, 
for me, well, it's the most fun I've had in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing home the bacon: Franzen raised pigs as a youngster growing up in 
Rancho Santa Fe. One, a stout fellow named B.B. that she had taught to sit, was 
named the 4-H Reserve Grand Champion at the Del Mar Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pigs are cute," she said, "and they're really smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Did B.B. win because of his intelligence? 
</P>
<P>
 "He was what the judges were looking for," Franzen said. "He had a high meat 
content." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently. Franzen's father bought the pig and well, the rest is breakfast 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was delicious," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, I've got some vegetarian teammates who are just going to love reading 
this." 
</P>

 The cat's P.J.: The men's soccer team is off to a 4-1 start and forward P.J. 
Powolski is continuing his barrage on goalkeepers and his assault on the Irvine 
record book. 
</P>
<P>
 Powolski, a senior who played at Orange Coast College, scored three goals and 
had two assists last week. He has 14 points, ranking him third in the NCAA Far 
West region and No. 16 in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "P.J. is our captain this year and he's become even more of a team player," 
Coach Derek Lawther said. "Now, he's taking the ball deep more, setting things 
up and doing a lot of defensive work, where last year he spent a bit more time 
sniffing around the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's finding that sometimes when you aren't always looking for it, things 
open up." 
</P>
<P>
 Powolski, who has 17 goals in only five games into his second season at 
Irvine, is already No. 2 on the Anteaters' all-time goals list. He's fourth in 
all-time scoring with 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The women's volleyball team was stuck overnight in Hawaii when their scheduled 
flight home Sunday night was canceled because of mechanical problems. But don't 
make any jokes about having to spend another day in paradise. The University of 
Hawaii beat Irvine, 15-5, 15-6, 15-5, Friday night and, 15-7, 15-7, 15-13, 
Saturday night, dropping the Anteaters to 1-8 on the season. In the first 
match, the Rainbows had 21 total blocks; Irvine had two. Irvine has lost eight 
in a row . . . Sophomore goalkeeper Stephanie Boes, from Dana Hills High, had 
12 saves in Saturday night's victory over Cal State Dominguez Hills. It was her 
third shutout of the season. Boes' 0.71 goals-against average is fourth-best in 
the NCAA Western region.

CADILLAC WEIGHS MAKING SPORT UTILITY VEHICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division is considering developing a sport 
utility vehicle to appeal to customers who want larger vehicles capable of 
carrying both people and cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really studying it quite intensely," Joe Kennedy, Cadillac's general 
director of marketing and product planning, told reporters Monday during a 
preview of the company's 1995 models. 
</P>
<P>
 Cadillac General Manager John Grettenberger said the move would allow Cadillac 
to keep customers who want larger vehicles from jumping to another brand, such 
as Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep Grand Cherokee and Mercedes-Benz's upcoming luxury 
sport utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the sport utility market appears to be much more than a flash in the 
pan," Grettenberger said. "I'm not saying that we're going to be in it . . . 
but we've either got to combat . . . or we've got to join it." 
</P>
<P>
 Grettenberger said sport utility vehicles appear to be attracting buyers away 
from the traditional luxury car market.

 Wall Street's bulls and bears dueled to a virtual draw Monday as stocks closed 
mixed amid continued speculation about whether the Dow industrial index can 
reach the 4,000 mark anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow closed up 3.37 points at 3,936.72, giving up most of an 18-point 
morning gain. Most broader indexes fell modestly, and losers outnumbered 
gainers by about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading settled down to a more normal pace after Friday's hectic session, when 
expirations of futures and options contracts inflated volume to the 
sixth-highest total ever on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The market got its morning lift in part on relief over the settlement between 
the United States and Haiti's junta leaders, which averted an impending U.S. 
military invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 But buyers stepped away in the afternoon, despite a generally calm bond 
market. The 30-year Treasury bond yield, which rocketed to a two-year high of 
7.77% on Friday on new reports of economic strength, eased slightly to 7.75% on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stock buyers may have turned wary as oil prices rose sharply, following 
unconfirmed reports of civil unrest in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil 
exporter. 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports of protests and arrests in the northern Saudi city of 
Buraida, where Islamic fundamentalists were said to be pressing the government 
for stricter adherence to Islamic law. In New York, October crude oil futures 
jumped 38 cents to $17.21 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency markets, the Japanese yen gained broadly on expectations that U.S. 
trade data for July, due today, will show a widening of America's deficit with 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The imbalance is largely responsible for the U.S. currency's persistent slump. 
In New York, the dollar fell to 98.53 yen from 98.93 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's weakness set the tone for another lousy stock session in Tokyo on 
Monday. The Nikkei index slid 242.15 points to 19,554.11, the lowest since 
April 4. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, many analysts admit they're surprised by the market's strength 
this month in the face of higher interest rates. But few believe the market has 
enough power to blow through the Dow 4,000 level soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be difficult for the Dow to get through 4,000 for the 
balance of this year," said Ricky Harrington, analyst at brokerage 
Interstate-Johnson Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Schroeder, analyst at MMS International, thinks the Dow may indeed top its 
record high of 3,978.36 soon but that the achievement would be fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Some classic growth stocks revived. Coca-Cola jumped 1 1/4 to a record 49 
after saying it expects third-quarter earnings to rise 25%. Rival Pepsico added 
1/8 to 33 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug stocks were also strong, including American Home Products, up 1 3/8 to 58 
1/2; Lilly, up 2 3/8 to 58 3/8, and Pfizer, up 7/8 to 65 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paper and lumber shares surged on optimism about rising prices. 
International Paper gained 1 5/8 to 78 1/4, Georgia-Pacific added 1 5/8 to 74 
3/8 and Stone Container leaped 7/8 to 20 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some gold stocks staged a rally, though bullion was flat. American Barrick 
leaped 1 1/4 to 25 5/8 and ASA surged 1 1/8 to 51 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Time Warner jumped 1 3/8 to 37 5/8 after financial columnist Dan Dorfman 
reported that General Electric, which is exploring the possibility of selling 
all or part of its NBC-TV unit, is also considering an opposite strategy of 
buying Time Warner. GE, which denied it is in talks with Time Warner, fell 1/2 
to 50 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, Nike slumped 2 5/8 to 62 7/8 after the shoe company 
reported a 7% drop in fiscal first-quarter earnings. The results were slightly 
below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other weak market sectors included energy and auto-related stocks.

 Micron Technology's Top Officers Quit: In a move that mystified industry 
observers, Boise, Ida.-based semiconductor maker Micron Technology Inc. said 
that its top three executives would resign sometime over the next month for 
"personal reasons." Leaving the company will be Joe Parkinson, chief executive 
and co-founder; Jim Garrett, president and chief operating officer, and Reid 
Langrill, chief financial officer. The company also announced that Steve 
Appleton will take over as chief executive. Appleton worked his way up from 
production-line worker to become CEO of Micron Semiconductor, a subsidiary that 
accounts for 89% of Micron Technology's sales.

 Wall Street's bulls and bears dueled to a virtual draw Monday as stocks closed 
mixed and speculation continued about whether the Dow will reach the 4,000 
plateau any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose modestly to 3,936.72, up 3.37 points, 
but other popular market measures lost ground. Losers outnumbered gainers about 
5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock trading settled down to a more normal pace after Friday's hectic session 
when expirations of futures and options inflated volume to the sixth-highest 
total ever on the Big Board. Volume on the NYSE floor came to 272.80 million 
Monday, compared to 410.69 million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stability in bonds failed to inspire much equity buying. The key 30-year 
Treasury bond yield dipped to 7.75% from 7.77% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency markets, the Japanese yen gained broadly on expectations that U.S. 
trade data for July, due today, will show a widening of America's deficit with 
Japan. The imbalance, which reached nearly $60 billion last year, is largely 
responsible for the U.S. currency's persistent weakness, supplying a steady 
stream of Japanese-held dollars that must be exchanged for yen. In late New 
York trading, the dollar was quoted at 98.53 yen, down from 98.93 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said events in Haiti are unlikely to develop into a major concern on 
world markets, but they said there was relief that an 11th-hour agreement 
avoided a U.S.-led invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixed performances by foreign markets didn't offer a consistent course. Prices 
rose in London, ended flat in Paris and fell in Frankfurt. In Tokyo, stocks 
sank to their lowest depths since April. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. analysts see 4,000 as an elusive level for the Dow. "I think it's 
going to be difficult for the Dow industrials to get through 4,000 for the 
balance of this year," said Ricky Harrington, senior vice president and 
technical analyst at Interstate-Johnson Lane. "The market's strength is very 
selective, confined to some tech stocks and big-cap blue chips." 
</P>
<P>
 However, others see momentum. Jim Schroeder, market analyst at MMS 
International, said the market might soon break through the record mark, but it 
is unlikely to stay in uncharted territory for very long. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil prices rose sharply Monday on an unconfirmed report of civil unrest in 
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter. October crude oil jumped 38 
cents to $17.21 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 The report about protests and arrests in the northern Saudi city of Buraida 
came from a London-based group of ex-patriot clerics and professionals who 
favor stricter adherence to Islamic law. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Time Warner jumped 1 3/8 to 37 5/8. The media-entertainment company's stock 
attracted fresh attention after a published report in USA Today said General 
Electric, which is exploring the possibility of selling all or part of its NBC 
television division, is also considering an opposite strategy of buying Time 
Warner. GE fell 1/2 to 50 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earnings helped some individual stocks. Coca-Cola rose 1 1/4 to 49 after 
saying it expects strong third-quarter soft drink sales and a 25% increase in 
third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nike slipped 2 5/8 to 62 7/8 after reporting a drop in first-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * ReLife Inc. leaped 5 5/32 to 23 5/16 on Nasdaq after Healthsouth 
Rehabilitation Corp. said it would buy ReLife in a $180-million stock swap. 
Healthsouth gained 1 1/4 to 37 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold prices advanced. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current 
delivery gained 10 cents to $390 per troy ounce.

 T-Bill Rates Near 3-Year High: Interest rates on six-month Treasury securities 
rose in auction to their highest levels since Oct. 21, 1991.Rates for 
three-month bills were unchanged. The Treasury Department sold $11.7 billion in 
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.05%, up from 4.99%. It sold 
another $11.6 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 
4.61%, the same as last week. The new discount rates understate the actual 
return to investors: 4.73% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,883.50, and 5.25% for a six-month bill selling for $9,744.70. The 
average yield for one-year Treasury bills rose to 5.72% last week from 5.62% 
the previous week.

WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY; RULES LEAVE BONALY UP IN AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The CBS search for sports programming to fill its lost weekends, liberalized 
eligibility rules that have given Brian Boitano, Kristi Yamaguchi and others 
new competitive life and, of course, the Tonya vs. Nancy afterglow are dynamics 
that have combined to create more opportunities for more figure skaters than 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tug-of-war among traditional governing bodies, independent promoters, 
television networks and agents for the sport's few marketable names, such as 
Boitano and Yamaguchi, has also created more confusion than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, try to figure out the status of France's Surya Bonaly. 
</P>
<P>
 The French federation announced last month that Bonaly, the four-time European 
champion and 1994 world championships silver medalist, would compete in the 
U.S. Figure Skating Assn.'s annual invitational, Skate America, Oct. 27-30 in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bonaly's agent, Michael Rosenberg of Palm Desert, recently announced that 
she will open her season in a professional competition Oct. 1 in Sun Valley, 
Ida. 
</P>
<P>
 If Bonaly competes in Idaho, she will not be eligible for Skate America 
because the Sun Valley event, promoted by Michael Berg, is not sanctioned by 
the USFSA. 
</P>
<P>
 The USFSA, however, has begun negotiations that could result in Berg's 
receiving a sanction. 
</P>
<P>
 That would free Bonaly to compete in Skate America. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Rosenberg announced, Bonaly also is entered in an unsanctioned 
professional competition in Cleveland on Oct. 19. Negotiations between its 
promoter, Dick Button, and the USFSA are not as likely to result in 
sanctioning, so Bonaly again would be out of Skate America. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if Bonaly chooses to compete in events that do not have the 
blessing of the USFSA, she could still apply for reinstatement to the 
International Skating Union that would allow her to compete in the 1998 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 She must first submit her application to French federation officials, and they 
say that they will not pass it on to the ISU if she competes this season in 
unsanctioned events. 
</P>
<P>
 ISU council members, including USFSA President Claire Ferguson, met over the 
weekend in Zurich, Switzerland, in an attempt to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
 They should suspend all eligibility rules for one year, which would give 
interested parties an opportunity to sit down with each other and decide the 
best course for the sport and its athletes. One can only hope they would 
exhibit more vision than the parties involved in the baseball strike. 
</P>

<P>
 Along with Gwen Torrence in the 200, Jackie Joyner-Kersee was one of only two 
U.S. women to lead individual events in this year's outdoor track and field 
listings.  
</P>
<P>
 But although she was first in the long jump, she dropped to third in an event 
she has dominated in recent years -- the heptathlon -- behind two Germans, 
Heike Drechsler and Sabine Braun. Competing in her first heptathlon in 13 
years, Drechsler was the world leader with the 6,741 points that she scored two 
weeks ago in Talence, France. Asked if she is setting her sights on 
Joyner-Kersee's world record of 7,291, Drechsler said, "One never knows. If I'm 
motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 She was motivated to compete in Talence by a $30,000 appearance fee.

 Track and field's male athlete of the year: Is it Great Britain's Colin 
Jackson, who won all 20 110-meter hurdles races he entered, or Algeria's 
Noureddine Morceli, world leader in the 1,500, the 3,000 and the mile? . . . 
U.S. athletes showed so little interest in track and field's recent World Cup 
in London that International Amateur Athletic Federation President Primo 
Nebiolo says they might not have a separate team in future events. They would 
have to qualify as part of a team representing the Americas. 
</P>

<P>
 The U.S. Gymnastics Federation is waiting to hear whether two-time world 
all-around champion Shannon Miller will try to represent the United States in 
the Nov. 11-20 world team championships in Dortmund, Germany.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller's coach, Steve Nunno, said previously that she needs a break after 
finishing second in the all-around in her two most recent competitions, the 
Goodwill Games and the U.S. championships. If Miller decides she wants to 
compete in Dortmund, she must qualify for the U.S. team in an Oct. 15-16 meet 
in Richmond, Va.

 Chinese sports officials win the gold medal for double standards. After 
lecturing International Olympic Committee members last year about not allowing 
politics to interfere with sports in the vote for the site of the 2000 Summer 
Olympics, the Chinese threatened to boycott next month's Asian Games in 
Hiroshima if Japanese authorities allowed Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, to 
enter the country for the opening ceremony. Taiwan announced Monday that Vice 
Premier Hsu Li-teh will attend instead. 
</P>

 World Scene Notes 
</P>
<P>
 For relinquishing her place in the 200-meter freestyle final to compatriot 
Franziska van Almsick, who subsequently set a world record, Germany's Dagmar 
Hase was rewarded with a $2,000 plane ticket and an expenses-paid, 15-day 
vacation in the country of her choice by Lufthansa Airlines. "I don't know 
whether to laugh or cry," Hase said. . . . U.S. speedskaters Dan Jansen and 
Bonnie Blair were supposed to end their careers together in next February's 
world sprint championships in Milwaukee. But Jansen has already retired, and 
he's telling friends he believes Blair will decide to continue competing until 
someone can consistently beat her. . . . The IOC site selection committee that 
will visit 10 cities bidding for the 2002 Winter Olympics arrived Sunday at its 
first stop, Salt Lake City. The committee will cut the field to four in 
January.

 Linebacker Winston Moss, one of eight Raiders fined for a fight against the 
Seattle Seahawks a week ago, plans to appeal the $7,500 judgment levied against 
him by the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fined included defensive back Derrick Hoskins ($6,500) and defensive 
linemen Chester McGlockton ($4,000), Aundray Bruce ($4,000) and Anthony Smith 
($2,500).Three others, whose identities were not revealed, were fined $2,500 
each for being in the area of the fight, bringing the total Raider bill to 
$32,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Seahawks were fined a total of $27,000.

</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, who led the league in penalties a year ago and were off to 
another big start with 19 penalties for 125 yards in the first two games, had 
another 10 for 118 yards Sunday against Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 But 42 of those yards came on a controversial pass interference call against 
cornerback Lionel Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was little of the pushing and shoving that has characterized many 
previous Raider-Bronco games. STEVE SPRINGER

 Cleveland Brown running back Eric Metcalf was charged Monday with carrying a

pistol in his car wasn't loaded. The two were arrested last week on charges of 
drag racing along Interstate 480 in suburban Cleveland.

 Tony Casillas, declared a free agent this summer after leaving the Kansas City 
Chiefs to be treated for hypertension, signed a one-year contract with the New 
York Jets. . . . Chicago Bear quarterback Erik Kramer has a "slightly 
separated" shoulder and said he probably won't know until later this week if he 
can play Sunday night against the New York Jets. Kramer injured the shoulder 
when he was sacked by John Randle in the third quarter of a 42-14 loss to 
Minnesota on Sunday. . . . Pittsburgh Steeler defensive end Ray Seals has a 
broken left thumb and his status for Sunday's game at Seattle hasn't been 
determined. . . . Colt defensive end Jon Hand fractured his right leg in 
Sunday's 31-21 loss at Pittsburgh and is expected to be sidelined about eight 
weeks. The Colts might get lineman Tony McCoy back sooner than expected. He had 
surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee last week and has responded 
quicker than anticipated. Tackle Steve Emtman, who had season-ending knee 
injuries each of the past two years, also has continued making progress but is 
not ready to return to the lineup.

Olivier's "Hamlet" and Alfred Hitchcock's "The 39 Steps." Terms were not 
disclosed.Goldwyn acquired the North American theatrical, video, television and 
cable rights to the library from Rank Film Distributors Ltd. The acquisition 
creates a 900-title library for Goldwyn, the largest such library in North 
America, according to the company. Goldwyn President Meyer Gottlieb said he 
expects that acquiring the library could account for 5% of the company's 
revenue in fiscal 1997 and boost earnings even more. Rank is the largest 
independent film distributor in Britain. Other movies in the Rank Films library

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND JOHN LIPPMAN: COMPANY TOWN; IS TISCH READY TO LET GO 
OF THE REINS?

 Whether or not CBS winds up being sold during the current wave of network 
mania, media sources say Chairman Laurence A. Tisch is in the market for fresh 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 People close to CBS report that Tisch recently put out a feeler to Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, the outgoing chairman of Walt Disney Studios. According to those 
sources, the overture included day-to-day control of the network and the 
opportunity to expand its entertainment holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS declined to comment. A spokesman said Katzenberg also had no comment and 
that his only immediate plan is to spend time with his family. Other industry 
sources acknowledged the Tisch talks but said that running CBS is just one of 
many job opportunities that Katzenberg, who once tried to persuade Disney to 
buy a network, plans to consider in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood executives take the Katzenberg overture and other recent events at 
CBS as signs that Tisch is anxious to hand over the reins of power one way or 
another. Insiders say the network has been adrift since its planned merger with 
QVC, the home shopping network headed by Barry Diller, fell apart in July. 
</P>
<P>
 While the prospect of the volatile Diller becoming chief executive of the 
Tiffany Network made some executives uneasy, it also temporarily boosted morale 
after years of absentee stewardship. Tisch, who briefly became engaged in the 
network, is now described as once again "detached." 
</P>
<P>
 "The company's quite weird right now," said one senior CBS executive on 
Monday. "It's like waiting for Godot." 
</P>
<P>
 Tisch, 71, took control of CBS in 1986. In the wake of the failed QVC deal, he 
said the network was not for sale. Even so, many CBS insiders anticipated that 
Diller would return to the table with fresh financial backing, or that Walt 
Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner would make a bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the focus has shifted to General Electric's NBC unit, which is said 
to be fielding interest from Disney, Time Warner, Turner Broadcasting System 
and ITT. 
</P>
<P>
 One top source insists that Tisch is still ready to sell at the caviar price 
of $400 a share. "What he doesn't want to do is give up his influence," the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 But another says Tisch is tired of the day-to-day grind, adding: "Larry Tisch 
is not a seller. All these rumors about CBS being sold are not true. He's 
looking for CBS to be better run and better managed." 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg is said to be Tisch's choice for the job because of the skill he 
demonstrated in building Disney into a Hollywood dynamo during his 10 years at 
the studio. Sources say they're unaware of other candidates being contacted by 
Tisch. 
</P>
<P>
 Any executive of Katzenberg's caliber would probably join CBS only with the 
understanding that bigger things are in store for the company -- perhaps an 
alliance with a studio or cable company. While there are few jobs as heady as 
being chief executive of a network, in the era of mega-media conglomerates CBS 
has shrunk to one of the smallest around. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a broad-based entertainment and media giant with interests that spanned 
records, magazines and book publishing, CBS has been pared back by Tisch to its 
core business: a television network, seven company-owned TV stations and radio. 
Unlike Capital Cities/ABC and NBC, Tisch has refused to diversify into cable. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wall Street's fervor for major networks remains high. CBS shares reached a 
record high of $361 during trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange before 
closing $3.375 lower at $353.125 in profit taking. The stock has zoomed from a 
low of $253.25 earlier this year.  
</P>

 If Florida voters approve a gaming initiative in November, don't look for Walt 
Disney Co. at the dealers' table. The company sees no upside to hordes of 
gamblers descending on the Sunshine State -- even though Disney World in 
Orlando suffers from flat domestic tourism and a drop-off in international 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They continue to have a fairly negative bias toward gaming," said Jill 
Krutick, an analyst for Smith Barney. "They feel the Disney culture doesn't mix 
with gaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney in the past has vocally campaigned against Florida gambling. This year 
its stance is more low-key, but Krutick says the company could still come out a 
winner in the casino sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent report, she notes that Las Vegas-style gaming might revive 
Florida's international tourism trade, following a series of attacks on 
visitors to the Miami area. Casinos would also bring a major capital investment 
to the Florida region, which could increase overall spending. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside for Disney is the likelihood that gaming would cut into the 
amount of time visitors spend at theme parks. Krutick says casinos would also 
draw such non-theme-park-goers as adults without children. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts estimate that operators could realize $5 billion in profits annually 
from Florida gaming. But it remains a controversial issue. A survey by the 
Florida Opinion Poll found that 50% of the 553 voters interviewed opposed a 
casino in their county. There was a margin of error of plus or minus four 
percentage points.

NEXT STEP; A NEW TEST FOR PEACEKEEPERS; LESSONS LEARNED IN SOMALIA WILL HELP 
U.N. AVOID SAME PITFALLS IN HAITI, ANALYSTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the bloody debacle in Somalia that led to withdrawal of American forces 
in March, the United Nations was not expected to take on a similar mission 
anytime soon. But on paper at least, the U.N. takeover from American troops in 
Haiti due to take place in a few months bears a troubling resemblance to the 
ill-fated succession in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, analysts do not expect a repeat. For one thing, both the Clinton 
Administration and the United Nations learned some bitter lessons from the 
Somali experience. Former Ambassador Robert B. Oakley, who served as the 
special representative of Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton in Somalia 
and became an almost truculent critic of the U.N. mission there, says that both 
American and U.N. officials have planned the Haiti mission carefully and should 
avoid the pitfalls of Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked with a lot of my buddies," he said in an interview Monday after 
the Americans went ashore, "and I have a pretty good feel about how they are 
going about it, and they have done a meticulous job in planning this." 
</P>
<P>
 While "there's always a question about what happens when you take a plan into 
the real world," Oakley continued, he did not see a Somalia-like fiasco 
developing in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the Security Council resolution that authorized the 
American intervention that began Monday, a United Nations peacekeeping force of 
6,000 troops will take over from the U.S. mission "when a secure and stable 
environment has been established" and the United Nations "has adequate force 
capability and structure to assume the full range of its functions." 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told 
reporters that the time for the takeover will be "measured in months, not 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 In Somalia, the U.N. takeover was delayed for almost six months, much to the 
annoyance of American officials like Oakley, who accused Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali of dragging his feet. But Boutros-Ghali believed that the 
United Nations was being rushed into Somalia before the Americans had completed 
their job and before the U.N. force was strong enough to take over. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, however, the secretary general appears to be working in step 
with the Clinton Administration. He issued a statement Monday welcoming "the 
news that a military intervention has been averted in Haiti and that conditions 
have been created for the peaceful implementation" of the Security Council 
resolution. U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright kept Boutros-Ghali closely 
informed as she managed to steer the resolution through the Security Council on 
July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in line with the resolution, he announced that he was sending 15 military 
observers to Haiti at the end of the week, from France, Argentina, Ireland, 
Malaysia, New Zealand and Bangladesh. The resolution authorizes him to send up 
to 60 observers to monitor the U.S.-led operation and to prepare for the future 
transfer of command to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeup of the peacekeeping force has not yet been announced, but it is 
expected to include 3,000 American troops. According to U.N. spokesmen, offers 
of troops have also come from Bangladesh, Bolivia, France, Canada, Suriname, 
Russia, Nepal and some Caribbean states. It is understood that the force will 
be led by American commanders. 
</P>
<P>
 This U.N. force is distinct from the American-led multilateral force of more 
than 2,000 soldiers and police from 24 countries that will soon become part of 
the American-led task force in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council resolution, which was passed 12-0 on July 31 with China 
and Brazil abstaining and Rwanda absent, lays down three main tasks for the 
American-led multinational force: 
</P>
<P>
 * Facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow the prompt return of deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish and maintain "a secure and stable environment." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. role, under the resolution, would be threefold: to help in the 
professionalization of the Haitian armed forces and a new, separate police 
force, to sustain the security established by the American-led force, and to 
prepare a favorable climate for free and fair legislative elections in 
December.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the resolution sets down these mainly political tasks for the U.N. 
peacekeeping mission, it is widely assumed that the American forces will 
initiate the activities as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In Somalia, in December 1992, President Bush sent 28,000 troops into the East 
African country on what he regarded as a solely humanitarian mission to 
safeguard relief operations in the midst of a bloody civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali, however, believed that the Americans should have disarmed 
Somalia's warring clans. When the Americans refused to do this, according to 
Boutros-Ghali, it failed to fulfill the Security Council's mandate that it 
create "a secure environment" in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 When a multinational U.N. force took over from the United States and its 
allies in May, 1993, it did try to disarm the factions, a mission that led to 
the disastrous manhunt for Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid and the slaughter of 18 
U.S. Rangers in an abortive raid on Aidid's lieutenants. The deaths shocked 
Congress and the American public and prompted President Clinton to announce the 
withdrawal of the American troops by March. 
</P>
<P>
 The withdrawal of the Americans so weakened the U.N. mission in Somalia that 
most observers expect the United Nations to pull out altogether by the end of 
the year -- leaving Somalia in renewed chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts see clear differences in Somalia and Haiti despite the similarity in 
the process of a U.N. mission replacing a U.S.-led multilateral force. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, the military problem is much, much smaller in Haiti," said 
Edward C. Luck, senior policy adviser of the United Nations Assn. "You just 
don't have the quantity of arms around nor the heavy weaponry around. And you 
don't have these armed tribal groups involved in a civil war." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's much more doable in Haiti," he went on. "I think the nature of 
the U.N. Haiti operation will hopefully be closer to traditional peacekeeping 
with an element of nation-building. The Somalia mission turned into peace 
enforcement. I don't think you are going to get to that in Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Luck also believes that the United States, if faced with problems in Haiti, 
will stick it out and not rush off as it did in Somalia, dooming the U.N. 
operation there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were willing to go into Haiti with guns blazing," he said. "We ought to be 
able to stick around if things get rough." 
</P>
<P>
 Oakley also pointed out that both the United States and the United Nations now 
agree on the importance of creating a professional police force in Haiti. He 
insists that the United Nations was not committed to this in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time, everyone understands you have to do that if you're going to have a 
neutral body to supervise law and order in a difficult environment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that the United States recognizes that the Americans will be "the 
prime mover" in the Haiti operation, even when the United Nations takes over. 
The United States refused to accept this in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oakley also sees evident problems ahead. "The most difficult," he said, 
"is the question of how much are the U.N. and the U.S. going to be involved in 
running Haiti's affairs once the U.N role kicks in."

THE WEEK AHEAD: JOHANNESBURG; BACK TO THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 British Prime Minister John Major arrives today in South Africa, a former 
British colony, for talks on reviving a broad range of cultural, political and 
economic ties that became dormant during the dark years of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the three-day visit will be Major's address to the newly 
elected all-race Parliament. He is the first British premier to visit the 
country since 1960, when Harold Macmillan formally rebuked the white 
supremacist government for its racist policies. Macmillan drew a frosty welcome 
when he warned the Parliament, then all white, that a "wind of change" and 
liberation was sweeping colonial Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Major's chief goal would be to increase British trade and 
investment in post-apartheid South Africa.

THE WEEK AHEAD: COPENHAGEN; DIVISIONS IN DENMARK

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Danes voting for a new government Wednesday are expected to give a lukewarm 
endorsement to the incumbent prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, a Social 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an alarmingly high 12.5% unemployment rate, life remains comfortable 
in what has become one of the world's richest, most liberal welfare states -- a 
system built by the Social Democrats.The recent election victory by the Social 
Democrats in Sweden is also expected to improve Rasmussen's chances for 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 But if his present four-party, center-left coalition fails to gain a majority, 
Rasmussen could be forced into the same dilemma as his Swedish counterpart, 
Ingvar Carlsson: either to cooperate with the radical left, or reach across the 
political divide to seek informal backing from the conservatives.

THE WEEK AHEAD: UNITED NATIONS; THE DEBATE BEGINS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-six heads of state, 19 prime ministers and two crown princes are on the 
speakers list for the general debate of the 49th annual meeting of the U.N. 
General Assembly, which begins Monday . 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of debate -- more precisely a parade of speakers on a host of 
different subjects -- will bring Presidents Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin of 
Russia to the podium. Most countries send their foreign ministers or U.N. 
ambassadors to speak, and the torrent of words is so great that insightful 
ideas from small countries often fall by the wayside. But for each country, 
it's an opportunity to address problems before the largest international forum.

THE WEEK AHEAD: MUNICH; BAVARIA TO THE POLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bavarians go to the polls on Sunday to elect a new Parliament in the final 
state vote before Germany's federal election Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative Christian Social Union, which exists only in Bavaria and 
serves as a junior partner in the ruling national coalition, is expected to 
maintain its long hold on the state's government. The Social Democratic Party, 
challenging Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the national level in October, is 
receiving only 29% support in polls in Bavaria. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Democrats' other junior partner, the liberal Free Democratic 
Party, is receiving in polls nationwide less than the 5% needed to get into 
Parliament, which could indicate problems for Kohl in putting together a 
national coalition if his party triumphs.

CULTURE; LOOMING SHIITE LEADERSHIP DISPUTE MAY WIND UP AS TALE OF TWO CITIES; 
QOM IN IRAN AND NAJAF IN IRAQ SEEK PRIMACY AS HOLY PLACE FOR THE 100 MILLION 
FOLLOWERS WORLDWIDE.

<P>
 In the middle of the flat, palm-studded plains of southern Iraq, not far from 
the ancient banks of the Euphrates River, rises a shrine like none other in 
Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Its sculpted gold facade and intricately inscribed walls house the body of 
Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed whose political will to lead the 
Prophet's descendants and subsequent death on these plains led to the birth of 
Shiite Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, while world headlines commonly look to Iran as the political voice of 
the Shiites, it is to the holy city of Najaf that Shiites around the world look 
as their spiritual heartland. It is to Ali's holy shrine that Shiite pilgrims 
creep on their knees, kissing the floor and the shimmering gold around the tomb 
as they crawl in ecstasy toward the center of their faith. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, far from the public eye that usually focuses on Shiite activism in 
Lebanon and Iran, a quiet but crucial political battle has been brewing over 
who -- and which city -- will assume the leadership of the 100 million Shiites 
all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivals for preeminence are Qom, the theological center of Iran southwest of 
Tehran, and Najaf, whose historical dominance has been threatened in recent 
years by the rise of the Islamic revolution in Iran since 1979 and the growing 
perception that the Shiite clergy in Iraq have fallen dangerously under the 
influence of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute is the Shiite equivalent of arguing over how to elect a Pope and 
where to place the Vatican. And its outcome could be critical not only for 
Shiite Muslims, but for a world that has felt the far-reaching and sometimes 
deadly political will of Shiites in quarters as distinct as Lebanon's militant 
Hezbollah organization and Iran's Death to America crusades. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiite power was unquestionably vested in the hands of Iranian leader 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini during the early years of the Iranian revolution, 
but Khomeini's death in 1989 left the community with no clear messiah. Though 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei succeeded Khomeini as religious leader in Iran, lines of 
theological authority were handed down to the world's remaining great and 
elderly Shiite scholars, many of whom far exceeded even Khomeini in religious 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent power vacuum was created by the deaths of three venerable Shiite 
leaders in the last two years: First, in Najaf, Grand Ayatollah Abdul Qassem 
Khoei, who died in August, 1992, at the age of 93; Grand Ayatollah Abdul Aala 
Sabzawari, whose death at age 83 a year later was another blow to the clerical 
hierarchy at Najaf, and then Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Reza Golpayegani, whose 
death at age 96 in Qom on Dec. 9 finally left the Shiite leadership with no 
clear heir apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Golpayegani who had held the title Supreme Marja of the Shiites, and 
after his death Iranian political leaders immediately named a successor in Qom, 
Ayatollah Mohammed Ali Araki. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Araki already well into his 90s, indications are that Iran plans to 
replace him when he dies with their national religious leader, Khamenei, 
setting the stage for Tehran to consolidate its hold on the Shiite theocracy 
around the world, in addition to its political arm. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement has caused a backlash in Shiite communities in Iraq, Lebanon, 
Saudi Arabia and parts of Pakistan and India, which are pushing for restoring 
the Supreme Marja to Najaf, the traditional center of Shiite scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Najaf's 1,000-year-old howzat , or centers of theological learning, have 
produced most of the world's most important living Shiite scholars, including 
many of those now living in Qom, they argue. Most of those advocating the 
reseating of power in Najaf have mentioned as a candidate Ayatollah Ali Hussein 
Sistani as supreme Shiite leader. 
</P>
<P>
 In Qom, many supporters are lining up behind Ayatollah Mohammed Rohani -- 
viewed by some as an opponent to the regime in Tehran -- to replace Araki when 
he dies. 
</P>
<P>
 And the battle lines are forming. 
</P>
<P>
 It should come as no surprise to anyone that old Arab-Persian rivalries, and 
the very bitter recent memory of the Iran-Iraq war, stand just in the shadows 
of this theological debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is the battle without intrigue, most of it linked to Saddam Hussein's 
violent crackdown on Iraqi Shiites after their attempted uprising at the end of 
the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 When Khoei died in 1992, he was supposed to have left a will designating a 
successor to the Shiite leadership. But no such will was found. Moreover, Iraqi 
authorities ordered Khoei's rapid burial without a doctor's examination to 
indicate why he died. His nephew said Khoei had seemed fine when they spoke on 
the telephone the day before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Iran have used Hussein's campaign against the Shiites as evidence 
that the Supreme Marja cannot operate independently in Najaf and should instead 
be located in Qom. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheik Azri Qommi, a student of the late Khomeini and an opponent of Qom's own 
nominee, Rohani, told the London-based Arabic daily Al-Wasat that he 
nonetheless opposes Najaf's Sistani as well, "because he lives in Najaf under 
the authority of Saddam Hussein, whereas the Marja should live under no 
pressure." Hussein's power base is in the region around Baghdad, an area 
populated by Sunni Muslims, theological rivals of the Shiites. 
</P>
<P>
 Qom is not without its own political intrigues. The Iranian government last 
spring reportedly detained a number of senior clerics close to Rohani, who is 
known to oppose the concept of the "guardianship of the clergy" by which Iran 
installs its political and religious leadership in the same hands, in the 
present case those of Khamenei. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that there is an argument at all is reassuring in some ways to many 
of those whose greatest fear is a powerful link between Shiite Iran and Iraq's 
9.6 million Shiites, who make up slightly more than half of Iraq's population. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since the end of the Gulf War, many U.S. analysts have feared 
that the downfall of Saddam Hussein could plunge Iraq into chaos and drive the 
Shiite south straight into the arms of Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that even Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of 
Iran's main client organization in Lebanon, Hezbollah, has said he regards 
Najaf's Sistani as the most qualified, is a sign that the Tehran regime's hold 
on the Shiite clergy around the world is far from complete. 
</P>
<P>
 In Najaf these days, there is a mood of quiet determination. Most of the 
clerics there permitted by the government to be interviewed, along with the 
head of the government's religious endowment ministry, seem to have thrown 
their support behind yet another candidate -- presumably acceptable to the 
Iraqi government -- Sayed Mohammed Sadr. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadr is the cousin of the celebrated Lebanese Shiite leader Imam Moussa Sadr, 
who mysteriously disappeared while on a visit to Libya in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any leadership of the Shiites must come from here, and if the Iranians say 
the Marja should not be in Najaf they are making a big mistake, because we know 
most of them received their religious studies here," said Jabr Abbas Abed, 
religious endowments manager in Najaf. 
</P>
<P>
 "These rooms you see are the first school in religious studies for the whole 
world," Abed said. "The successor of Imam Khoei must have qualifications to be 
elected here in this holy city. He must be enlightened in religious matters and 
highly religiously informed. For this reason, Mohammed al Sadr has been chosen. 
He is all Arab. He was nominated and he was chosen to be the religious source 
here in the holy city of Najaf, and the matter is closed." 
</P>
<P>
 But what about Sistani, regarded as the leading contender from Najaf? 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be very clear about this point," responded another Najaf clerical 
leader, Sheik Abed Aly Moudafar. "The man who will represent the Shiia in the 
world must have special characteristics. He must be well-informed and 
enlightened, he must have characteristics which enable him to lead. Sistani is 
not our nominee. This name has been nominated by Iran and other countries, for 
their own interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Qom's nomination of Araki, both men scoffed. "Where is this man's 
learning?" Moudafar said. "Where are his books? What has he done for Islam? 
What has he done to claim this post?" 
</P>
<P>
 And what about allegations that the Baghdad regime is exercising undue 
influence over the clergy in Najaf? Abed waved his hands impatiently. "Those 
who say this are liars, because the government doesn't have the control you're 
suggesting. To prove it, the government is not responsible for naming the 
religious clergy. What you are talking about is exactly what is going on in 
Iran itself." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Jabr led his guests to a gallery of photographs, all depicting 
damage to the holy shrines in Najaf and neighboring Karbala. They show massive 
government-sponsored repairs to the gold-encrusted facades, which Jabr says 
were damaged by allied bombing during the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, according to the Iraqi opposition and secret videotapes of the 
attack, most of the damage was done by Iraqi tanks during the attempt to put 
down the Shiite uprising after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour, led by this mustachioed Hussein look-alike, had a surrealistic feel 
as it played out in the courtyard that was the scene of some of the fiercest 
resistance to Hussein only three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was (George) Bush's gift to the Iraqi people during his last days," Jabr 
said, pointing to a photograph of chipped tile on the wall of Ali's sacred 
shrine. He bristles when a guest asked about the uprising, which he insisted 
"was no uprising." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an act of robbers and vandals supported by the Saudis," he said, and 
goes on to the next photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can see," he said, "the damage caused by our enemies did not spare 
even the houses of God."

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; LATIN AMERICA INSIDERS BACK ON WINNING TRACK; REFORMERS ONCE 
PROVED POPULAR. BUT IMPROVING ECONOMIES HAVE USHERED BACK THE OLD GUARD, WHO 
NOW PROMISE STABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The pendulum of power is swinging again in Latin America. No, the generals are 
not coming back. The political pendulum of the 1990s moves between civilians -- 
insiders and outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, the label of political insider could be a serious 
handicap for a Latin American presidential candidate. Electorates in many 
countries seemed disillusioned, even disgusted, with politicians from parties 
that had inhabited the halls of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders and newcomers were on the rise. They challenged insiders with 
surprising new strength, and they won the presidencies of Brazil and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 A major reason was economics, said Peter Cleaves, director of the Institute 
for Latin American Studies at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latin America went through enormous economic changes over the last 15 years," 
he pointed out, "and just at the time when the economic crisis seemed deepest, 
and the population had the least respect for the political system, you had an 
opportunity for a lot of outsiders to come in." 
</P>
<P>
 But lately it has been the other way around. As a series of elections puts the 
region's politicians through their paces, insiders, standard-bearers of the 
political Establishment, are claiming victory in country after country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the economic situation is picking up a bit," Cleaves said. "The 
incumbents and those who sort of promise stability are going to do better." 
</P>
<P>
 Stronger and increasingly well-organized party systems also favor insiders in 
many Latin countries, analysts say. A prime example is Chilean President 
Eduardo Frei, who was elected by a landslide and took office March 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Frei is this country's second Christian Democratic president in a row, a 
former senator and party chairman. He also is an insider by heredity, having 
lived in La Moneda, the presidential palace, when his father was Chile's chief 
executive in the 1960s. A Christian Democratic alliance with the Socialists was 
a key to Frei's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chilean case is the consolidation of a political system and a party 
system," said Manuel Antonio Garreton, a political scientist with the 
University of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents inaugurated this year in Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican 
Republic, El Salvador, Honduras and Panama are also vested insiders from 
parties in power or ones that had held power in recent years. Presidents with 
similar Establishment credentials took office last year in Bolivia and 
Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 1, President-elect Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico's ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party will take over in Mexico. "El PRI" has been ushering its 
insiders into the presidency without a break for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts say Mexicans want political and social reform but have 
opted for change from within, fearing an outsider might bring disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo, a former budget minister, belongs to a new generation of party 
insiders who stand for moderate reform. Although he won with the lowest 
majority ever tallied by the ruling party, 48.7% of the votes, his ballots 
almost doubled those of outsider Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the rightist 
runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 And insiders are now favored to win other Latin American elections in the 
coming months: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former Senate leader and Cabinet 
minister, is expected to finish ahead of outsider Luis Inacio (Lula) da Silva, 
a leftist former labor leader, in the first round of presidential elections 
Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democratic Party has never produced a president, 
but he held the posts of foreign minister and finance minister in the current 
Brazilian administration, and his rivals for the presidency call him "the 
government's candidate" and "the official candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Economics has been the key to Cardoso's success in opinion polls. As finance 
minister, he pushed through an economic reform plan that has reduced inflation 
from an alarming monthly rate of more than 45% in June to less than 2% in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Uruguay, former President Julio Sanguinetti of the Colorado Party is 
widely seen as the likely winner in presidential balloting scheduled for Nov. 
27. The Colorados and the now-governing Blancos, or National Party, are 
Uruguay's traditional insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when many Latin American outsiders were on the rise, Tabare Vazquez 
won election as mayor of Montevideo, the national capital and home of more than 
one-third of all Uruguayans. But this year, Vazquez and his outsider coalition 
of leftists and Blanco dissidents are lagging behind Sanguinetti and the 
Colorados in polls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alberto Fujimori, the former outsider who won Peru's presidency in 1990, is 
now the No. 1 insider and the favored candidate for April elections. Fujimori 
gained in popularity in 1992 when, backed by the army, he suspended the 
constitution and shut down the Congress, which was dominated by old-line 
insiders who opposed him. 
</P>
<P>
 A new, pro-Fujimori Congress was elected later in 1992. Fujimori's main rival 
so far for the 1995 contest is Javier Perez de Cuellar, who is well-known as a 
former secretary general of the United Nations but is an outsider to Peruvian 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 * Argentina's flamboyant Carlos Saul Menem is favored to win a second term in 
May elections, thanks to a recent constitutional reform that eliminated a ban 
on reelection. Menem is the leader of the Peronist Party, founded by the late 
President Juan D. Peron in the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem and Fujimori took office amid tidal waves of hyper-inflation, and both 
have tamed spiraling prices with drastic cuts in government spending, 
privatization of state-owned enterprises and other policies favoring a free 
market. Their policies have brought brisk economic growth but also increased 
unemployment and hardship for their countries' poorest people. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Menem's supporters, Fujimori's have pushed through a constitutional 
amendment that allows his reelection. In most Latin American countries, 
constitutions prohibit the immediate reelection of a president -- a provision 
aimed at keeping insiders from becoming too entrenched in power. The military 
coup has been the other notable way of removing Latin American insiders from 
power. Then, in the 1980s, the pendulum made an almost complete swing to 
democracy -- and there it has stayed, with the notable exceptions of Cuba and 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, civilian insiders 
seemed vulnerable in many Latin American countries. Debt crisis, recession and 
high inflation had beleaguered the region during most of the 1980s, dubbed 
Latin America's "Lost Decade." 
</P>
<P>
 Relief from economic problems seemed slow in coming, and official corruption 
began cropping up. Voters almost everywhere were open to leadership from 
sectors outside old-line political elites and main-line party machines. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, leftist movements might have been an alternative to traditional 
parties in Latin America, but the collapse of international communism and 
democratic gains around the world discredited revolutionaries and militarists 
alike. It was as if there were a vacuum waiting for outside forces to fill. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Collor de Mello, a telegenic but obscure politician from one of 
Brazil's smallest states, started the outsider trend, launching a campaign for 
the presidency with a newly created party that had no national structure. He 
lashed out at political insiders, promising a new era of clean and efficient 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The message caught on, and Collor rose from obscurity to victory, beating 
another outsider, Lula da Silva, in a runoff vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1990, the even more obscure Fujimori repeated the feat in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders, it seemed, were on a roll. On the eve of his runoff victory, 
Fujimori told The Times: "If I win and am successful, this will be contagious 
for all of Latin America." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the pendulum never made a full swing across the region, the trend 
toward outsiders looked strong for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Cuauhtemoc Cardenas with his new Democratic Revolutionary Party had 
become a powerful force, as was television talk-show host Carlos Palenque and 
his new party in Bolivia. Other outsiders were emerging by winning races for 
mayor in such important cities as Montevideo; Lima, Peru; and Sao Paulo, 
Brazil. Skillful use of television helped them. TV was an increasingly 
effective vehicle for political mobilization in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, voting for an outsider was less a vote of faith or allegiance 
than a "punishment vote" against political elites or a desperate gamble on 
someone new. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, the voters lost their bet on Collor. Little more than two years 
after his election, a Congress dominated by political insiders impeached him on 
charges of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as economic conditions across the region improve, voters seem more 
inclined to stick with familiar politicians than to take a chance on new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Since mid-1993, insiders have taken office in these countries: 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia -- Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, a former planning minister who led the 
conquest of Bolivian hyper-inflation in the mid-1980s, assumed his country's 
presidency in August, 1993. He belongs to the Nationalist Revolutionary 
Movement, which has held power several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Paraguay -- Juan Carlos Wasmosy took office in August, 1993. A former Cabinet 
minister, he is the country's first civilian president in four decades and a 
member of the Colorado Party, which supported military President Alfredo 
Stroessner until the general was deposed in a 1989 coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Honduras -- President Carlos Roberto Reina was inaugurated in January. Reina, 
a professional politician most of his life, comes from the social democratic 
wing of the Liberal Party, which held power during most of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuela -- With the economy a shambles and corruption scandals raging last 
year, voters picked longtime political insider Rafael Caldera as president. 
Caldera, inaugurated Feb. 2, ran as an independent and beat candidates of 
Venezuela's two main old-line parties. But as a former leader of one of those 
parties, the Social Christians, and as a former president and senator, he also 
has solid old-line credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Rica -- Jose Maria Figueres became president on May 8. Like Chile's 
Frei, Figueres is the son and namesake of a former president. 
</P>
<P>
 El Salvador -- Armando Calderon Sol took office June 1. Calderon Sol is a 
member of the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, the party 
in power when he was elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia -- President Ernesto Samper took office Aug. 7, keeping the 
traditional Liberal Party in power. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominican Republic -- President Joaquin Balaguer, dean of the region's elected 
insiders, took the oath of office Aug. 16 for his seventh presidential term. 
Balaguer, 87 and now blind, has governed his Caribbean nation for 20 of the 
last 28 years. But his victory this year, tainted with fraud charges, was a 
narrow one -- possibly because of persistent economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Panama -- Ernesto Perez Balladares took office Sept. 1. He was an aide to the 
late Panamanian strongman, Gen. Omar Torrijos, and his party has dominated 
Panamanian politics in recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez's Democratic Revolutionary Party was the political arm of Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega, the dictator ousted from power by the U.S. military invasion of Panama 
in 1989. Noriega is now serving time in the United States for drug trafficking. 
Perez, who was temporarily jailed by the Americans after the invasion, is 
accompanied in government by some of Noriega's staunchest cronies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many insiders now holding office are leaders of a new generation within 
established parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueres in Costa Rica took office at age 39, Calderon Sol in El Salvador at 
45, Perez in Panama at 48, and Samper in Colombia at 43. Zedillo in Mexico is 
42 and will be his country's youngest president this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Most promise change and reform, and to some extent, all of them advocate 
free-market, lean-government policies. Said Mark B. Rosenberg, a Latin America 
specialist at Florida International University in Miami: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's now common wisdom that countries only have one option, and that 
is to open their economies and be competitive in the global commercial 
environment. And they're all trying to find ways in which they can attract 
foreign investors. And heck, in the old days, that was anathema." Insiders

PROFILE; COMING TO THE AID OF HIS PARTY; GREGOR GYSI HAS REBUILT THE FORMER 
EAST GERMANY'S COMMUNIST FACTION INTO A NEW POLITICAL FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was Nov. 8, 1989, and the Berlin Wall was but a day away from its 
appointment with the sledgehammer. In East Berlin, the governing class was 
running for cover. The Politburo of the East German Communist Party had just 
resigned en bloc; the government, in a hapless, too-little too-late attempt to 
contain the uncontainable, had announced that it would ease the regime's 
detested travel restrictions.  
</P>
<P>
 On the steps of the Zentralkomitee building, tens of thousands of protesters 
gathered to tell the party that such half-hearted measures were not quite what 
they had in mind.  
</P>
<P>
 Out of the crowd stepped a small man, his hair thinning at the top, a lawyer 
and single father whose round glasses and intense brown eyes suggested a life 
of reading and contemplation. Few outside the nascent East German reform 
movement even knew Gregor Gysi -- much less what he stood for. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, not even Gysi himself, supposed that just one month later he would be 
elected chairman of what was left of the Communist Party and given one of the 
great Missions Impossible of the socialist world: to reform the decrepit, 
wholly discredited, Soviet-installed entity, and to persuade Germans that they 
should not only forgive and tolerate it, but to vote for it of their own 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to go to the rally, make a speech and go back home," Gysi said 
recently in an interview in the eastern German town of Potsdam, where he 
stopped for lunch during a day of electioneering. 
</P>
<P>
 It has taken five years, but Gysi has done the undoable: He has rebuilt the 
Communist Party -- doing business now as the Party of Democratic Socialism -- 
and made it such a force in today's united Germany that the country's 
established politicians have resorted to a campaign of old-time red-baiting to 
try to put it in its place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democratic Socialist cadres will lead the people over the precipice," 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned a jeering crowd recently in this 
far-eastern German town. "As long as we (Christian Democrats) are here, we will 
never let the fascist, Communist rabble tyrannize the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians of Kohl's cut worry not that the former Communists could ever 
govern again -- this is not Hungary or Poland -- but that they are gaining 
strength in the east at a time when Germany's electoral dispensation is at a 
watershed. Ever since the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in 1949, 
parliamentary power here has been divided among three established, centrist 
parties: the conservative Christian Democrats, the center-left Social Democrats 
and the independent Free Democrats, who have moved back and forth into 
coalitions with two big entities.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, with federal elections looming on Oct. 16, the Free Democrats are 
faring so poorly that they may not even be represented in the next Parliament. 
That would leave Kohl's governing Christian Democrats without a suitable junior 
coalition partner, should they fail to achieve a clear majority by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 With the former Communists flourishing in the old East, Germany's mainstream 
politicians thus face the unappetizing prospect of having to parley with their 
lifelong enemies come the morning of Oct. 17, just to be able to form a 
workable government. This is precisely what happened in June, in elections in 
the state of Saxony-Anhalt: The Social Democrats were able to form a viable 
coalition government only with tacit cooperation from the former Communists, a 
party with which, they had sworn long and loud, they would never to do 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl called the move "a scandal on an enormous scale" and "a treasonous act." 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone is to blame -- or to thank, depending on one's point of view -- for 
this remarkable comeback, it is Gysi, who says all of it is as much of an 
astonishment to him as to any German. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a good fantasy life, but not that good," he says, laughing at the way 
things have been turning out. 
</P>
<P>
 That's typical Gysi: jocular, personable -- his remarks, in short, are nothing 
like the one-sided discourse East Germans were for so long accustomed to 
hearing from their political leaders. In a part of Germany where people spent 
40 years listening to stolid comrades yammer on and on about sociopolitical 
abstractions, Gysi is something new: a politician who can speak well off the 
top of his head, who can articulate the dreams and disappointments of his 
constituency, and best of all, who can make people laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 His style has been so arresting in eastern Germany that he has become 
something more than a leading politician here; he is also seen, these days as a 
charmeur . German newspapers have taken to printing regular updates on his 
personal entanglements, and otherwise serious interviewers seem unable to 
resist asking him about his "effect on women." 
</P>
<P>
 They might better ask Gysi, formerly a general-practice lawyer and low-level 
member of the Communist Party, what made him choose to stand by the party after 
the East German regime collapsed. It wasn't as if he had had no options, after 
all. He could have left for the West, as tens of thousands of other East 
Germans did in 1989, or he could have stayed put and gone to work with one of 
the new reform groups that were coming together that summer and fall. Gysi 
himself did the legal work for the first and most prominent such group, the New 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 So why didn't he join, say, the New Forum, instead of pressing on with the 
Communists? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer lies, in part, with Gysi's family history, and the loyalty he felt 
to an organization which, in the 1930s, fought the Nazis head-on and suffered 
terribly for doing so. Gysi's father, a Communist Party member and a Jew, spent 
the war years dodging concentration camps and doing underground work for what 
there was of a German resistance. Gysi grew up in a household where this past 
was a living, shaping force; his parents' social milieu included Communists 
from all over Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I inherited a certain family history," he says. "The Gysi family lost a total 
of 18 members in concentration camps. Although there were certainly things 
(about the East German Communist Party) to criticize, overall, I believed when 
I became a member that I was joining the biggest anti-fascist force in 
Germany." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, when the party Old Guard stumbled in 1989, Gysi says, "I didn't want 
the socialist ideals just to drown, even though those ideals have been damaged 
and spoiled. I thought that I had responsibility for this country, and for a 
process that was under way." 
</P>
<P>
 Not the least of his fears at the time, he says, was the possibility that 
hard-liners might seize control of the party and order goons into the streets 
to crush dissent, as happened in Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was crucial that people come to the top of the party who could guarantee 
that peaceful changes take place," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's one thing to want to keep a party nonviolent and something else again 
to want to make it into a modern, relevant institution. Gysi says his reforms 
got an initial boost from the simple fact that so many former Communists 
abandoned the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "A party that loses 90% of its members simply has to be a different party," he 
says. When the party lost all power, he points out, the opportunists and 
careerists departed, leaving the field wide open for reformers like him. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say it was easy to turn around the party's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a lot of hatred," Gysi says of the early months and years after the 
Berlin Wall fell, when the Communist Party was written off as 
stake-through-the-heart dead, and western Germans were accusing remaining 
leaders like him of siphoning its resources out of the country. In 1992, the 
newsmagazine Der Spiegel even published reports that he had cooperated with the 
East German secret police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really difficult for me," he says. "If I had known the personal 
consequences (of assuming the party leadership), I never would have done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gysi sued Der Spiegel for libel and the court decided in his favor. But in 
January, 1993, overextended and exhausted, he chose not to run for another term 
as party chairman. He remains today the party's top representative in 
Parliament -- the Democratic Socialists now hold 16 seats in the 662-seat 
Bundestag -- and is the Communists' unquestioned conscience and locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, many of those who follow Gysi these days do so not because they 
embrace his socialist vision, but just because they are shocked by the changes 
that German unification has brought. Unemployment in eastern Germany is at 
double-digit levels, prices have soared compared to East German times and the 
social safety net -- while downright cushy compared to America's -- is peanuts 
compared to the cradle-to-grave security that the old German Democratic 
Republic used to offer.  
</P>
<P>
 Against this unhappy backdrop, the Democratic Socialists have helped found 
various citizens' rights groups -- a tenants' union, for instance and an 
unemployed people's society -- and maintained close, grass-roots ties with the 
sick, the elderly and the unemployed. Over the last few weeks, as the former 
Communists have come under increasingly strident attacks from centrist 
politicians, these disadvantaged eastern Germans have proven some of Gysi's 
most militant supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But one recent poll found that 44% of the party's supporters claim 
satisfaction with their economic lot. These well-off supporters have turned to 
the Democratic Socialists, in many cases, because they live in the former East 
and have grown convinced over the last five years that they will never be 
adequately represented by a western politician or party. 
</P>
<P>
 Still more support comes from idealistic young eastern Germans who, despite 
everything that has happened, still believe in socialism. To them, the fall of 
the Eastern Bloc was not a sign that socialism is a doomed ideology; rather, it 
was simply evidence that socialism won't work without democracy. Biography 
</P>
<P>
 Gregor Gysi 
</P>
<P>
 Born: Jan. 16, 1948, in Berlin 
</P>
<P>
 Education: Studied law at East Berlin's Humboldt University and received his 
doctorate in 1976; he is also a certified cattle breeder, thanks to the former 
East German requirement that all university students learn a manual trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Marital status: Gysi has been divorced since 1974. He has two sons, ages 22 
and 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Quote: "At the moment, we're the most honest, upstanding party in Bonn. There 
is not one scandal involving Democratic Socialist delegates. And the reasons 
for this are clear to see: First, we are morally superior, and second, we 
haven't had the chance to become immoral because no one will make deals with 
us."

MEDIA; A FULL-COURT PRESS: NEWSPAPERS MULTIPLY AS SELF-RULE TRANSFORMS GAZA; 
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY SAYS IT'S OPEN TO DIVERSE VIEWS, THOUGH SOME SAY 
CRITICIZING ARAFAT STILL BRINGS PENALTIES.

<P>
 Rarely a week goes by when the little newsstand opposite Damascus Gate of 
Jerusalem's Old City does not receive a new Arabic-language newspaper or 
magazine seeking a place amid the tumult of the Palestinian press. 
</P>
<P>
 " Dakakim -- shop windows," Dana, the aged vendor, said dismissively as he 
hung up the newest publications for display. "They are nothing but shop windows 
for this group or that. They are published to sell a point of view, and people 
look but rarely buy. These papers come one week and go the next." 
</P>
<P>
 But four months of self-government -- with the prospect of national elections 
-- has transformed the Palestinian political scene and with it the Palestinian 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, the head of the 
Palestinian Authority, has granted licenses for two new daily newspapers, one 
that will be independent politically and the other belonging to the Islamic 
opposition, and several political parties are planning to establish weeklies 
and reopen others closed over the past decade by Israeli military authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nearly a million people in (the) Gaza (Strip); currently it is the 
basis of the Palestinian Authority and we need a paper of our own," said Taher 
Shriteh, 34, a respected Gaza journalist, who expects to publish the first 
issue of Falastin (Palestine) on Thursday. "We think there is also a strong 
economic base for it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to know what is going on. With the ending of the Israeli 
occupation after 27 years and the establishment of the very first Palestinian 
government, they have tremendous interest in all the things that are going on 
around them. They want to be part of these changes, and for that they need news 
and information. We think there is a need and a demand for Falastin." 
</P>
<P>
 With $150,000 pledged by Gaza business people and Palestinians abroad to 
finance the first six months' publication, Shriteh has recruited a staff of 
eight, bought state-of-the-art computers and plans to start Falastin as a 
16-page tabloid weekly with an initial press run of 5,000. The paper will go 
daily when there is sufficient advertising to make it profitable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shriteh, honored by the National Press Club in Washington with its Freedom of 
the Press Award in 1993 after repeated arrests by Israeli military authorities 
and an attempt to deport him, has pledged that Falastin will be politically 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business will be news, straight news," Shriteh said. "Editorials will be 
limited, opinion columns will be labeled as opinion and news will be our 
mainstay. We are not with the Palestinian Authority or against it, we are not 
with the opposition or against it. I have worked with Reuters (the London-based 
international news agency) for three years, and I very much like the standards 
it has for objectivity and fairness." 
</P>
<P>
 The paper planned by Imad Falouji, jailed in 1991 by Israeli authorities as a 
leader of the Muslim fundamentalist movement Hamas during the intifada , the 
rebellion against the occupation, will be decidedly different. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be an opposition paper -- a decent one -- not only because we differ 
with Arafat and the Palestinian Authority on fundamental issues, but because we 
believe people want such a critical assessment," said Falouji, 31.  
</P>
<P>
 In granting a license to Falouji for Al Watan (The Nation), Arafat made a 
point of stressing the Palestinian Authority's adherence to the principle of 
freedom of the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave Hamas a license for this paper because they are part of the 
Palestinian nation and have the right, within the law, to express their views," 
Arafat told visitors to his Gaza City office last week. "We are not afraid of 
the opposition. We want a lively political scene." 
</P>
<P>
 But Arafat shut down An Nahar (The Morning), one of the two principal 
Arabic-language newspapers in Jerusalem, at the end of July on grounds that it 
did not have a license from the Palestinian Authority. Despite protests from 
Palestinian journalists and human rights groups, Arafat did not permit An 
Nahar, which claims a circulation of 5,000, to reopen until publisher Othman 
Hallaq promised to end its pro-Jordanian line and replaced his managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing itself as "Palestinian to the bone and Arab to the marrow," An 
Nahar resumed publication this month with an editorial titled "A Pledge . . . 
and a Thank-You," that praised Arafat as "the brother, leader and symbol" of 
Palestinian nationalism and declared that Palestinians were living in a time of 
"great victories and excellent achievements." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after arriving in Gaza to head the Palestinian Authority, Arafat had 
summoned Palestinian journalists to tell them of the role he expected the media 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot accept that our press be fed by imported ideas . . . or be bought by 
Arab, Western or Asian countries," Arafat warned.  
</P>
<P>
 "You are forming ideas and influence public opinion. I hope this formation of 
ideas will be in Palestine's interests and not against it. And it is my right 
to say this." 
</P>
<P>
 Radwan abu Ayyash, chairman of the Palestinian Broadcasting Corp., issued 
similar warnings to his staff, but there have been only limited radio and no 
real television broadcasts as the authority awaits equipment promised by 
European donors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not saying 'no' to criticism or 'no' to opposition," Freih abu Medeen, 
the authority's justice minister, asserted in an interview in Gaza City.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our demand is that the media operate within the broad national consensus, not 
outside of it. We want our press to be pro-Palestinian, however it sees this 
cause, but not pro-Jordanian or pro-Saudi or pro-Syrian. We want political 
dialogue and political debate. We, in fact, have too little of it now and would 
like to encourage a diverse media." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's closure of An Nahar nonetheless alarmed many Palestinians for it 
appeared to be an early and ominous move against the political pluralism they 
believe must be the foundation of a democratic Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 Daoud Kuttab, a prominent Jerusalem broadcaster and commentator, protested the 
action along with 25 other Palestinian journalists -- and lost his space in the 
leading Arabic newspaper, Al Quds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the impression that people, including Mr. Arafat, who lived so long in 
exile in the Arab world brought back with them the style of other Arab leaders, 
including a subservient, monotone press," Kuttab said. "That won't work here."  
</P>
<P>
 Al Quds takes its name from the Arabic name -- "The Holy" -- for Jerusalem, 
has a circulation of 60,000 and exercises considerable influence throughout the 
Palestinian territories. Mahmoud abu Zuluf, the veteran editor and publisher of 
Al Quds, sees a need for a more diverse press but doubts that it will come from 
politics alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, these new papers and magazines are all pamphlets -- they appear with 
a new political trend and they disappear when the money runs out," Abu Zuluf 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a journalist, and I have no political ambitions. I can tell you, 
however, that a politician who has no popular support will not create it 
through establishing a newspaper -- just as a paper will not gain a strong 
readership and become a success in the community simply through its politics."

SHIITE-SUNNI RIVALRY RESTS ON ISSUE OF RIGHTFUL SUCCESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a single Land of Islam that the prophet Mohammed claimed on behalf of 
his followers. But the years after his death saw a power struggle that would 
forever divide Muslims between Sunnis and Shiites. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-ago contest persists to this day, as Iran's Shiite government rivals 
Sunni leaders -- from moderates in Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia to Sunni 
fundamentalists in Sudan -- for ideological and political supremacy over the 
world's 1 billion Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 The beginnings of the split go back to the year 632, when Mohammed died 
without naming a successor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the simmering rivalry that ensued, that role was filled by Abu Bakr, a 
learned man and Mohammed's closest friend. He took the name and title Khalifat 
Rasul Allah (successor of the prophet of God), later shortened to Caliph. Abu 
Bakr united the still-mutinous tribes of Arabia in a holy war, or jihad , to 
claim new Muslim territory in Syria and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Abu Bakr died two years after the prophet, and Omar, another strong and 
powerful companion of Mohammed, succeeded as caliph. When Omar was 
assassinated, Othman, one of the prophet's earliest converts, continued the 
land campaign into Persia (now Iran), Egypt and Cyrenaica, in what is now 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
 Othman himself, sitting on a wealthy but increasingly restive empire, was 
murdered by insurgents who broke into his house, and Ali, the first caliph to 
come directly from Mohammed's family, succeeded to the caliphate. In addition 
to being a relative of the prophet, Ali gained prominence when he married 
Mohammed's daughter Fatima and fathered the prophet's only two grandsons, 
Hussein and Hassan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali left Medina to set up his own capital at Koufa in Iraq, but he fell into 
trouble with the Umayyad leaders in Syria, who were outraged at Othman's murder 
and bent on revenge. The Umayyads never forgave Ali for not pursuing the 
assassins. Ali's political influence diminished in the turmoil, and he was 
assassinated by former followers in 661. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus ended the era of the so-called rightly guided caliphs, all related to 
Mohammed by marriage and chosen by the prophet's companions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Umayyad governor of Syria, Muawiyah, took over next, leading to an era of 
what historian Arthur Goldschmidt Jr. called the "swollen bureaucracies of 
Damascus and Baghdad, headed by kingly caliphs who succeeded by heredity." 
</P>
<P>
 A significant number of Muslims believed that the caliphate should be held in 
the hands of the prophet's own family. With Ali and his son Hassan dead, 
Hussein remained, and he refused to recognize Muawiyah's Umayyad successor as 
legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein's followers in southern Iraq urged him to rebel against the Umayyads, 
but when he and his band of 72 men reached Iraq, he found himself pitted 
against an Umayyad force of several thousand. Hussein died in the famous Battle 
of Karbala in 680, and his followers, who since Ali's death had been calling 
themselves Shi'at Ali, or the Party of Ali, never forgot. 
</P>
<P>
 They believed that only when the rule of Mohammed's rightful family heir was 
restored would tyranny and injustice be replaced with good government under the 
Koran. The parade of historic caliphs notwithstanding, the Shiites believed 
that the rightful leadership of Islam began with Ali and proceeded down in a 
line of male heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Their message grew. From Iraq, they spread throughout the Muslim empire, and 
Shiite Islam was born. Today, it has 100 million followers -- nearly 10% of the 
world's Muslims -- forming majorities in Iran, Iraq and Bahrain.

MARKET FOCUS; BEIRUT BUILDERS FIND 2 PATHS TO RECOVERY; A PURGE OF CORRUPT 
OFFICIALS DIDN'T END THE USE OF BRIBERY. BUT MORE AGENCIES ARE TAKING A MODERN, 
ETHICAL APPROACH.

 When the young Lebanese woman arrived to interview for a job in Beirut's 
resurgent business sector, she was chomping on a wad of gum, wearing makeup 
that would make Tammy Bakker cringe and insisting that she would consider only 
executive secretarial positions despite a dearth of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Crushed by 15 years of civil war, the seaside capital has regained its Middle 
Eastern fire for commerce, but finding qualified personnel is just one of the 
hurdles facing local and foreign entrepreneurs. There is, as always, the need 
for grease, the kind represented by crisp paper bills. And developers would 
give an arm for a working phone. First-rate secretaries may be as rare: One 
agency reported 50 requests for English-speaking secretaries. Only three 
suitable candidates were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the 30 foreign companies here under contract with the Lebanese 
government's Council for Development and Reconstruction find roadblocks at 
every turn. South Korea's Hyundai conglomerate has sent men in to help French 
and Italian companies repair the country's collapsing power system. The Korean 
engineers, who came without their families, live in boarding houses, work 10 
hours a day, 6 1/2 days a week, and go six months between home leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way of working makes us cheaper than European firms," said a business 
manager with one of the Korean companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanon's estimated $4.4-billion reconstruction means good money for all the 
foreigners, but the pitfalls are as deep as the postholes they are digging. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other foreign businesses, the Koreans have found at least two codes of 
business ethics at work here, traditional and modern -- or crooked and clean. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional method involves the payment of baksheesh -- bribes -- every 
foot of the way. "These people (in some government agencies) are of the old 
mentality, they should be replaced by young, young-thinking people," the Korean 
manager complained after months of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 A purge of corrupt government officials took place last year. A list of 6,000 
accused individuals was produced. The disciplinary team was lauded. But then 
the inevitable happened. Pressure groups went into action. Only 600 people were 
cast out -- many to be quietly reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Council for Development and Reconstruction, on the other hand, has a clean 
bill of ethics. Bids are opened in front of all participating companies and 
payments are made on time, the Korean manager said. Set up in 1977, the council 
was revamped by businessman Rafik Hariri after he was appointed prime minister 
in 1992. Last Christmas, Hyundai handed out promotional pens to council staff. 
No, the Koreans were told, we cannot accept gifts, just send a card. 
</P>
<P>
 Even higher ethics ratings go to Solidere, the private real estate company the 
council created to rebuild Beirut's city center. Many of its staff are 
U.S.-educated -- young, bright and modern. 
</P>
<P>
 Clean or dirty, any business eventually depends on communications, one of 
Lebanon's most stubborn business problems. A Lebanese-Canadian businessman said 
he offered $2,000 in bribes to get a phone line. The money should have done the 
trick, but there weren't any lines available. 
</P>
<P>
 Private companies provide cellular phones for $1,500, five times what a 
business might pay in the United States. One Lebanese businessman has been 
paying $300 a year to hold a telex line that hasn't worked in years, hoping 
that when things improve the government will offer fax lines to those holding 
telex lines.  
</P>
<P>
 Even international politics makes day-to-day commerce a challenge. What will 
happen when the inevitable peace treaty with Israel is signed? 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts say that will be a day of reckoning for the traditional Lebanese 
businessman. Trade treaties will follow. Competition from Israel for domestic 
and regional markets will be stiff. European businesses will join Lebanese 
expatriates in returning to the commercial scene here. Already working on 
government contracts here are firms from Britain, France, Italy, Germany, 
Belgium, Ireland, Denmark and Poland.  
</P>
<P>
 At risk will be the Lebanese merchant mentality that says the only good profit 
is the big and fast profit, said an American businessman who slips in and out 
of Beirut despite the U.S. ban on travel to Lebanon. No Lebanese is happy with 
anything under a 200% profit.

 Only a handful of U.S. businesses have held on here. Merrill Lynch, American 
Express and a few others operate with Lebanese staff. But at the academic 
level, the U.S. private sector is participating in the reconstruction. 
Harvard's School of Architectural Design has scheduled a course devoted to 
development plans for a 680,000-square-meter landfill in Beirut, the dumping 
ground for cleared rubble of the old downtown section.  
</P>
<P>
 Untouched by war are the twin pillars of Lebanon's financial system -- bank 
secrecy and unrestricted transfer of foreign currency. Those foundation stones 
may be enough to support the rebound.

ARTS CENTER PLANNED FOR SOUTH-CENTRAL; ENTERTAINMENT: PRIVATE AND PUBLIC FUNDS 
WILL BE USED TO REFURBISH A QUAKE-DAMAGED CHURCH AS A SITE FOR LIVE 
PERFORMANCES. RETRACTABLE SCREEN WILL ALSO ALLOW SHOWING OF FILMS.

 Motown founder Berry Gordy, Mann Theatres, the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency and several other public and private donors have given $3 million to the 
African American Unity Center to help turn a quake-damaged church into a 
community arts center, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ambitious plan, the damaged Presbyterian church building at 53rd 
Street and Vermont Avenue will become a facility offering a stage for live 
performances as well as a retractable screen for exhibiting first-run films. 
Curtis Owens, executive director of the Unity Center, said his organization 
also intends to provide an educational component for people to study aspects of 
film, stage and music production. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials plan to break ground on the Center for Performing Arts on Thursday 
and say they hope to complete the project next year. Owens said it will cost 
about $5 million to make the building usable, with a seating capacity for about 
450 people. He said the organization does not yet have a firm estimate for the 
total cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The African American Unity Center, which was active in the area's riot 
recovery effort, was founded three years ago by Danny Bakewell, who is also 
president of the Brotherhood Crusade. The Unity Center's two social service 
organizations, Unity House and the Community Unity Center for Human Growth and 
Development, already occupy two buildings in the same complex as the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens said the project was launched through a $500,000 grant from Gordy and a 
matching grant from the city of Los Angeles. The group also received money from 
FEMA, the Small Business Administration, Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed and Jo-Bete 
Music, founded by Gordy, and other corporations. The Los Angeles Music Center's 
Center Theatre Group/Mark Taper Forum has served as an adviser on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for City Councilwoman Rita Walters, whose district includes the 
Unity Center projects, hailed the new performing arts center as an alternative 
to gang activity for young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our whole district south of the freeway, there are close to 250,000 people 
who live there, and not a movie theater and not a theater space -- it's a 
complete lack," Howard Gantman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an area of the city where not only isn't there an abundance of public 
facilities, there aren't even any private centers available for young people 
even if their parents could afford to pay," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas called the groundbreaking on the center "great 
news." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited former Laker Earvin (Magic) Johnson's plan to build an 
eight-to-12-screen movie complex at Baldwin Hills' struggling Crenshaw Plaza as 
another example of burgeoning interest in arts and entertainment in L.A.'s 
urban areas. Another arts center in the Crenshaw area, Leimert Park's Vision 
Complex arts center, underwent a $120,000 face lift last summer prior to the 
Los Angeles Festival in a partnership between the festival and actress and 
community activist Marla Gibb. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means there is a lot of attention being focused on the arts and 
entertainment, a prime feature of life in urban areas that needs to be 
developed," Ridley-Thomas said.

A PAINFUL RETURN FOR QUAKE VICTIMS; RECOVERY: EX-RESIDENTS OF A DAMAGED SANTA 
MONICA BUILDING ARE ALLOWED BACK TO RETRIEVE BELONGINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME 
SINCE THE TEMBLOR. DAMAGE AND VANDALISM OVERWHELM SOME OF THEM. 
</P>

 For Shane Walker, it was a chance to retrieve some of his fashion sketches, a 
piano and a surfboard. Beverly Voran wanted some shelving and a last ocean view 
from her fifth-floor window. Victor Alferos got his framed pictures and a 
still-intact bottle of scotch. 
</P>
<P>
 They were part of a parade of former residents of the earthquake-damaged Sea 
Castle apartments in Santa Monica making an emotional pilgrimage to the 
building Monday, given their first opportunity to remove their belongings since 
the landmark structure was sealed off after January's temblor. As they stumbled 
down musty stairwells clutching their possessions, many were overwhelmed by the 
damage done not only by the quake, but also by those who have had full run of 
their rental units for the past eight months -- insects, rodents and burglars. 
</P>
<P>
 They also confronted the possibility that their visit to the severely damaged 
building -- once the jewel of the Santa Monica waterfront and now subject to 
bank foreclosure proceedings -- may be their last. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just losing a home, we're losing a whole community -- everyone was 
so close here," said Voran, a decade-long resident. "I just cry about losing 
this view. That's why I lived in this unit, which is the size of a closet, for 
so long." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Fire Department has notified the building's former residents, 
many of whom are now scattered throughout Southern California, that each will 
have four hours to pick up the pieces of their previous lives. On Monday, 
police and fire officials were in attendance as the recovery work began -- and 
so was the Red Cross, available for psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 A list of "Helpful Hints for Possession Recovery," sent out by the Fire 
Department, offered suggestions such as, "Come with a positive attitude -- it 
is not a pretty sight," and, "Bring dust masks, rubber gloves and insect 
repellent." Warnings were given about dirt, mold and mildew, and flashlights 
were recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department's suggestions scared a few residents, not to mention the 
hired help. Chris's Moving Men, a Culver City moving company, barred its 
workers from the premises after reading the "helpful hints." 
</P>
<P>
 "You think of our workers in dark hallways and stairways -- they'll be panting 
pretty good and we're worried about the health hazard," said Carol Wood, one of 
the firm's managers. "Who knows what bacteria is growing or what kind of 
creature is lurking in there."  
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles County health officials who inspected the building Monday 
deemed it suitable for temporary entry. The hallways were well guarded and 
brightly lighted, and the most dangerous areas sealed off. A light sea breeze 
blew through numerous open windows and some holes in the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some hallways were strewn with the feathers of pigeons that had gotten 
caught there and were eaten by rats. A few units with leaky fire sprinklers 
were covered with mold, earning the sobriquet "mushroom factories" from fire 
officials. And when a county health worker opened one refrigerator, hundreds of 
gnats were swarming inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandals did their heaviest damage to the upper floors. Many doors had been 
smashed in and personal property ransacked. Computers lay upside down, guitars 
stripped and broken. One unit had been inhabited for weeks by a squatter and a 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake was bad enough, but to then be violated again like this is 
horrible," said Barbara Held, a Santa Monica fire inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sad state of affairs for what once was the centerpiece of Santa 
Monica's beach vacation community. The large lime-green structure, a candidate 
for the National Register of Historic Places, was built in 1926 as the Breakers 
Beach Club and re-christened the Grand Hotel in 1934 at a lavish event attended 
by Jean Harlow, Joan Crawford, Ida Lupino and Maureen O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, the structure became housing for noncommissioned military 
officers. After the war, the building was part of the Chase and Monica Hotels 
chain. In the early 1960s, it was converted to apartment units. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, tenants have been embroiled in numerous disputes with 
landlord Robert Braun, clashing over rent increases, the building's lack -- 
until recently -- of a sprinkler system and the structure's general state of 
disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, the city of Santa Monica, backed with an order from its 
nuisance abatement board, was unable to get Braun to shore up the building. The 
city itself has spent $180,000 to strengthen the structure and is seeking 
reimbursement, putting a lien on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Rent Control Board will consider Thursday whether to exempt 
Braun's building from rent control. The board could vote to issue a permit 
under the city's post-earthquake recovery program, allowing reconstruction 
costs to be recouped by market-rate rents. But at a conservative renovation 
estimate of $7.5 million, rent control officials say it is doubtful even market 
rents would cover the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun's attorney, Sherman Stacey, declined to say what Braun's plans were, but 
noted that if the exemption passes, "he can do whatever he wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Braun faces a bigger hurdle. An official at First Federal Bank of 
California says foreclosure proceedings have commenced against the Sea Castle 
apartments for a defaulted mortgage loan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves many residents to wait out what could be a few years of 
litigation. Some have decided to throw in their beach towels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just kind of numb," said Alferos as he moved his belongings. "I just want 
to get this done and get out of here."

WAXMAN CALLS FOR U.S. PROBE OF SUBWAY; TRANSPORTATION: LAWMAKER URGES REVIEW OF 
CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS. HE CITES A STRING OF SAFETY AND COST CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying the interests of taxpayers and future subway riders are at stake, Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman on Monday urged U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena to 
launch a broad review of construction problems that have beset the Los Angeles 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are serious problems," Waxman said in a letter to Pena, citing articles 
in The Times over the past 13 months regarding "the presence of methane gas and 
hydrogen sulfide in some stations, tunnel walls that were built much thinner 
than contract specifications and ground sinkage along Hollywood Boulevard of up 
to nine inches." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman requested a "formal review of these problems -- including the 
performance of the Metropolitan (Transportation Authority), its subway 
construction contractors, and its management firm -- to determine what federal 
action is appropriate under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Pena said that the department had not yet received Waxman's 
letter and was not in position to respond. In Los Angeles, MTA officials also 
declined to comment, pending receipt of the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, the MTA's chief executive officer, Franklin E. 
White, said the agency must do a better job of enforcing contract requirements 
and obtaining in a timely fashion the finished subway that is costing the 
public $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman, whose questions in the mid-1980s regarding the presence of underground 
gas fields forced a re-routing of the proposed subway, said in his letter to 
Pena that not all of the safeguards recommended before construction were 
followed. For instance, he cited a Times article of last May reporting that the 
five subway stations now open to the public were built without gas sensors at 
passenger level. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensors were recommended by a panel of experts, some of whom Waxman 
appointed, as a way to detect hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas that is heavier 
than air and may otherwise escape accurate detection by sensors located near 
street level, in exhaust ducts. 
</P>
<P>
 The same article, Waxman noted, reported that a plastic liner installed to 
insulate the tunnels and stations from both hydrogen sulfide and methane gas 
was routinely punctured. According to a chief inspector who oversaw the work, 
necessary repairs were at times blocked by a contractor's superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside specialists retained by the MTA said last March, in response to the 
articles regarding the thin tunnel concrete, that the agency's construction 
management firm, Parsons-Dillingham, fell short of "acceptable industry 
practice" in its inspections of the structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman, whose district encompasses Hollywood Boulevard, also indicated to Pena 
that he was dissatisfied with the decision of MTA officials to not enforce 
until last March a contract specification that would have required the subway 
builder to use ground-stabilizing grout during excavation. A tunneling expert 
retained by the MTA had advised agency officials in October, 1993, to enforce 
the specification. 
</P>
<P>
 In late July and early August, after learning of significant sinkage on the 
north side of Hollywood Boulevard, the MTA's project manager decided not to 
order another type of grouting that engineers have said may have helped prevent 
further settling. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the MTA and its design and construction management firms 
have said that they hoped other precautions, such as adjusting the 
tunnel-boring machine, would prevent the sinkage that ultimately occurred and 
that on Aug. 18 forced a shutdown of excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman, referring to a Sept. 11 article that reported both of the MTA's 
grouting-related decisions, urged Pena to begin a review. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the core of these failures," Waxman said, "is a pattern of what appears to 
be indifference to accepted construction practices and disregard of existing 
requirements.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have an obligation to the public to ensure, at a minimum, that Metro Rail 
is constructed according to acceptable industry practice, that contract 
specifications are respected and enforced, that expert recommendations are 
followed, and that the safety of the riding public is valued and guaranteed," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Waxman said that he wrote to Pena because the federal 
government is paying for the largest share -- about 50% -- of the subway's 
design, construction and oversight. Waxman said that he believes the best way 
to ensure that taxpayers are getting what they pay for is to insist upon 
increased accountability for those responsible for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers retained by the Federal Transit Administration have for the last few 
weeks been reviewing the sinkage along Hollywood Boulevard. Stewart F. Taylor, 
the FTA's regional administrator, said the review is centering on whether the 
tunneling can be resumed safely. He said that the agency is not seeking to 
assess fault or responsibility for the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're looking at pointing fingers at anyone," Taylor said. "We 
certainly are not."

GETTING OUT ALIVE, BEARLY; NEIGHBORHOOD RALLIES TO PREVENT THE KILLING OF 
FREQUENT VISITOR

 An avocado-poaching, patio-prowling, 400-pound black bear that had been 
trapped in a Monrovia neighborhood won a last-minute stay of execution Monday 
-- from Gov. Pete Wilson, no less -- after homeowners launched a campaign to 
save their intrusive friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute reprieve came more than a year after residents of Norumbega 
Drive first spotted "Samson" lumbering into someone's back yard. Residents said 
he had become a fixture in the upscale area, and some claimed even to have 
spotted his mate and cub. 
</P>
<P>
 But this summer, officials said, his visits became more regular -- the bear 
would show up at some houses like clockwork every night, lumbering into pools, 
dipping his backside into hot tubs, swiping avocados from the trees, even 
stopping by regularly at one family's back patio to watch TV through the glass 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the locals said they did not fear the animal, believed to be about 9 
years old, and knew enough to keep their distance. But when some residents 
caught him on videotape soaking in a spa, the spectacle -- aired on the local 
news -- captured the imagination of animal lovers, who feared the bear 
ultimately would be captured and destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, by summer's end at least one homeowner, fearful of the wild animal's 
unpredictable nature, had complained to the California Department of Fish and 
Game, whose policy is to euthanize animals that stalk neighborhoods or show no 
fear of people. 
</P>
<P>
 As the pro-bear contingent launched an appeal to Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy 
(R-Arcadia) and Monrovia Mayor Robert T. Bartlett, state game wardens 
methodically laid traps for the animal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Samson was finally trapped near a Norumbega Drive home and taken 
away in a massive cage. The development was relayed to Mountjoy and Bartlett, 
who on Monday appealed to the governor for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor, acknowledging that "the bear has captured the imagination of 
well-wishers throughout the state," sent a letter to Fish and Game Director 
Boyd Gibbons, urging him to find some alternative to ending the bear's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like you to personally review the situation and assure yourself that 
all reasonable alternatives to euthanization are pursued," Wilson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, may be a challenge, authorities said, because the bear's teeth 
have been "ground down," which could mean that he might have difficulty feeding 
himself in the wild, said Patrick Moore, Fish and Game spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, Moore promised, the bear will not be destroyed. He said the animal 
was being held at an undisclosed location for medical evaluation and will be 
moved today to a Fish and Game facility in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Samson made himself too much at home in a populated area -- where he 
posed a threat to humans -- his next destination probably will be some form of 
captivity, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt very much they're going to turn it loose," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore said the public outcry contributed to the decision not to destroy the 
bear, which had been spotted as recently as Friday night frolicking for two 
hours in the Norumbega Drive back yard of Bonnie Forte. 
</P>
<P>
 Forte said she did not bother Samson and the bear did not bother her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not endangering anyone's life," noted the resident of the foothill 
community, who was considering making "Save Samson" T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Craig Bonholtzer, an animal rights activist who helped organize the Samson 
campaign, pointed to the fate of the bear that lumbered into an Azusa 
neighborhood in May. It was shot and killed by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to see a repeat of the Azusa incident," Bonholtzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mountjoy, who has lived near the foothills for more than 30 years, 
said the incident was of particular interest to him. As a Monrovia resident, he 
said, he has had his own back yard encounters with bears, coyotes, raccoons and 
other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Close encounters with the wild, he said, are a fact of life in California's 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget," he said. "We moved into their country. They didn't move into 
ours."

SCOTT HARRIS: DON'T MAKE BETTE DO YOUR DIRTY WORK; DRIVING WEST ON THE SIMI 
VALLEY FREEWAY, YOU MAY SPOT A SIGN SIGNIFYING THAT A TWO-MILE STRETCH WAS 
ADOPTED BY THE FBI. WHO WOULD LITTER HERE?

<P>
 One morning a couple weeks ago, fate guided me south along Tujunga Avenue to 
the on-ramp for the westbound Ventura Freeway. The view here reminded me of 
those old "Keep America Beautiful" ads: fast-food wrappers, beer cans, yellowed 
newspaper, foam cups, broken glass -- a landscape so obscene it would move Iron 
Eyes Cody to tears. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the top of the on-ramp, I thought I spotted the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bette Midler. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Bette in the flesh, but rather the Caltrans sign that advertises the fact 
that the singer-actress who bills herself as the Divine Miss M has promised to 
pick up trash along this two-mile stretch of freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Bette, it seemed, was letting us down. I wanted to guide her to this spot. I 
wanted to point to the mess and say, "Bette, what gives? Did this stuff blow in 
on the wind beneath your wings or what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Fonseca, however, says I shouldn't be so hard on Bette Midler. 
</P>
<P>
 "That whole section of the 101 is a trashed-up freeway. It's a tough spot," 
says Fonseca, coordinator of Caltrans' Adopt-a-Highway program for Los Angeles 
and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Midler's stretch through Studio City is difficult, he says, because 
"you've got all those interchanges there, a phenomenal amount of traffic. The 
sections that have a lot of on- and off-ramps are tough, because there's so 
much litter. People get backed up and there goes their McDonald's wrapper, 
their coffee cups, out the window." 
</P>
<P>
 You know who you are. Don't you understand that back seats are an excellent 
place to put the garbage? Scofflaws risk $1,000 fines, yet they act as if the 
roadways are extensions of landfills. Or maybe they really think they'll spot 
Bette Midler cleaning up after them. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, though you'll have a tough time finding Bette, you might find Joel 
Fonseca wiping out some graffiti if you know where to look. Fonseca is a little 
like Ty Sperling of the Hair Club for Men. He isn't just coordinator of the 
Caltrans program, he's also a participant, tending to a sound wall not far from 
his home in south Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Fonseca's office, more than 550 companies, groups and individuals have 
agreed to undo the work of slobs and vandals. Many, such as Ms. Midler, hire 
crews to handle the work and some do it themselves. For their trouble, 
participants receive two things: a measure of psychic satisfaction and a token 
of public recognition in the form of those familiar Adopt-a-Highway or 
adopt-a-wall signs that are such a curiosity to motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Bette Midler, who has said she became involved simply because she loathes 
litter, remains the most celebrated participant in the adoption program. Many 
signs recognize companies including movie studios, car dealerships and this 
newspaper, and many represent community organizations such as churches, 
"graffiti buster" groups and fraternities. Some note the efforts of families 
and individuals who share Bette Midler's loathing for litter, but not her fame. 
</P>
<P>
 A few always inspire double takes. Driving west on the Simi Valley Freeway in 
Granada Hills, you may spot a sign noting that a two-mile stretch was adopted 
by none other than the FBI. Who would litter here? 
</P>
<P>
 And part of Topanga Canyon Boulevard has been adopted by the Elysium 
Institute, which means nothing unless you know that Elysium is a nudist colony. 
Caltrans, Fonseca said, would insist that any nudists who wish to make a 
political statement while cleaning the highway should still obey safety 
regulations that require them to at least wear helmets and bright orange vests. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedians have suggested that people who are interested in adopting children 
might consider adopting a freeway first. There is a similarity, it seems, 
between freeways and orphans. Fonseca has a waiting list of parties interested 
in the Ventura Freeway. But there are a few forlorn stretches of the Foothill 
Freeway in Sylmar that nobody seems to want. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonseca says he won't entrust his freeways to just anybody. Many parties, he 
says, express interest until they learn that they are expected to clean the 
roadway monthly, or more often in some areas. Some groups, he says, have been 
dropped from the program for their failure to live up to the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what I was thinking when I saw Bette Midler's on-ramp a couple weeks 
ago. Some journalists bring down Presidents, governors, senators. Maybe I could 
bring down Bette Midler's sign. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time I cruised by Monday morning, there were six orange plastic 
trash bags waiting for pickup. There was some litter on the shoulder, but not 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe somebody tipped her off.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
PROSECUTORS PLAN TO TRY LAPD OFFICER FOR 3RD TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles announced that they will try for a third 
time to convict former Los Angeles Police Officer Stephen Polak in the drug 
money-skimming case that has resulted in convictions of 26 former Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty.Mark A. Byrne said that Polak, whose two trials have ended 
in hung juries, will be tried again on charges that he falsified a tax return, 
and is likely to be indicted again on charges that he joined five former 
sheriff's deputies on a task force that stole funds acquired in drug seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi set trial on the tax charge for Oct. 
25, although Byrne said the prosecution will probably seek to continue the case 
until a later date to avoid a conflict in the prosecutor's commitments.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SCHOOL 
OFFICIALS LAMENT RED TAPE IN QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Progress in making earthquake repairs and preparing the Los Angeles school 
district for another major emergency is being hampered by a lack of money and 
by communications problems between agencies, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special Board of Education meeting, district officials said they want 
better emergency training for all staff members, more communications equipment 
and quicker approvals for money to pay for repairs.But they said federal and 
state red tape is slowing the flow of funding to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about money," said board member Leticia Quezada. "We're not going to 
have a perfect system unless there are public dollars allocated to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that federal approval to pay for the repairs has been slow. 
About $73 million has been allocated to pay for damage to campuses; the 
district's earthquake damage estimates range from $200 million to $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brown, the district's facilities director, said that the process is 
inefficient, with too many different inspectors on some projects and not enough 
on others, and that decisions have been inconsistent. Also, Brown said, the 
schools must be responsible for securing equipment in the event of another 
quake.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; OPERATOR 
OF HEALTH-CARE SCAM SENTENCED TO 21 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Russian immigrant who, with his brother, pulled off what is believed to be 
the largest health-care scam in U.S. history, was sentenced Monday to more than 
21 years in prison and ordered to pay more than $41 million in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Smushkevich, who pleaded guilty last year to federal charges of mail 
and wire fraud, money laundering and embezzlement, among other things, also was 
ordered by U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter to forfeit more than $50 million in 
assets from his bogus medical diagnostics clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Smushkevich, who has been linked to the KGB and Russian 
organized crime, and his his brother, David, a Soviet doctor never licensed to 
practice medicine here, lured patients to their phony clinics by making 
unsolicited calls to people and promising free or low-cost physical exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most patients were healthy, prosecutors said, the two men falsified 
medical records to create the impression that the patients were ill and 
required sophisticated diagnostic tests for which insurance firms were then 
fraudulently billed. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the scam went on for 10 years before the case finally was 
broken by a joint federal-state investigation coordinated by the U.S. 
attorney's office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 David Smushkevich, the brother, is still awaiting sentencing.

BODIES OF 2 MEN ON EDGE OF COURSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A golfer in search of a lost ball on the grounds of the California Country 
Club in the City of Industry discovered two bodies Monday morning along a fence 
that divides the golf course from the northbound 605 Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Noel Lanier said the bodies, which were 
found about 8:25 a.m. on the freeway side of the fence, were those of two 
Latino men in their late 20s or early 30s who appeared to have been killed 
elsewhere before their bodies were dumped.They could not immediately be 
identified, however, and it was not clear what had caused their deaths or how 
long they had been dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanier said autopsies have been scheduled.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PANORAMA CITY; FIRM 
DROPS PLAN TO HAUL EARTHQUAKE DEBRIS BY RAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A company that proposed hauling earthquake debris by rail from the vacant 
General Motors plant in Panorama City has given up on the project because of 
delays in obtaining city permits, a representative of the company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 ECDC Environmental, a Utah-based waste disposal firm, had planned to begin 
hauling quake rubble to its 3,000-acre landfill in East Carbon City, Utah, by 
July, said Kent Loest, the firm's vice president for field operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Loest said the firm was told in June that the city would consider the 
permits under its normal approval process instead of under a quicker emergency 
process approved by the mayor shortly after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we would have the permits, most of the waste debris would be 
cleared away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilian Kawasaki, general manager of the city's Environmental Affairs 
Department, said the death of the project will not have a severe impact on the 
city because local landfills have enough capacity to accept all of the quake 
debris, and because the city is recycling as much of the rubble as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawasaki said ECDC and other firms have not given up on the idea of hauling 
trash from Los Angeles by rail and are studying sites throughout the region for 
possible rail-hauling centers.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUDGE TO 
REVIEW ORDER THAT KING PAY SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge agreed Monday to reconsider his order that Rodney G. King pay 
nearly $238,000 in legal fees to the Los Angeles Unified School District, which 
was ultimately dropped from the civil lawsuit stemming from his beating by Los 
Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 11, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies ordered King to pay $237,958 in 
legal fees for "frivolously" naming the school district -- whose officers were 
involved in the pursuit that resulted in his arrest and beating by Los Angeles 
police -- in his federal suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies agreed to reconsider the issue after King's lawyer, Steve Lerman, 
argued that his client had been in the process of changing attorneys at the 
time the penalty was imposed. Lerman said he had just been rehired by King and 
failed to appear at the hearing because he was not aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Two school district police officers were at the scene when King was arrested 
March 3, 1991, in Lake View Terrace, but did not participate in the beating. 
Attorney Rickey Ivie, who represents the cash-strapped district, filed the 
motion to recover legal costs, arguing that the suit lacked merit. In April, a 
jury awarded King $3.8 million in damages from the city but decided that none 
of the four officers involved were required to pay punitive damages.

TICKET TO RIDE; STATE LOTTERY: EL MONTE COUPLE, RICHER BY $24 MILLION, ARRIVE 
IN STYLE TO CLAIM THEIR WINNINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An El Monte couple traded in their winning Super Lotto ticket Monday afternoon 
for T-shirts, coffee mugs, baseball caps and a guarantee of $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Flushed from excitement and champagne, Kenny and Marylou Smith jumped out of 
their rented black-and-white stretch limousine wearing matching shirts from the 
Azusa restaurant where they bought the jackpot ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Cupping her face in her hands, Marylou, 48, said, "Oh golly, oh golly, I don't 
even know what to say." And then, as if to replace the words she couldn't find, 
tears rolled down her cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smiths, who own and work with their daughter at an automotive repair shop 
in Azusa, really needed the lottery money, said Marylou's father, Robert 
Fennell. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last five years, they've had a lot of hard times," he said. "They owe 
everybody in town." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Smiths can put their financial worries behind them with an annual 
check for $883,217 for the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 They will receive their first payment in a few weeks, said John Garner, the 
state's lottery office manager in Whittier. When the Smiths turned in their 
ticket in Whittier, they were loaded down with the T-shirts and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
 As news of a lottery winner hit the airwaves, the couple at first thought they 
had lost out because they heard that the winning ticket was bought n Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Callahan's, where we got the ticket, was in Irwindale," Kenny, 46, 
said. "Then a customer told me it was in Azusa, and I had my wife call the 
restaurant. I had her check the numbers once, twice, three times before I 
believed it." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple purchased the semiweekly lotto ticket last Friday at Callahan's 
Food and Beverage restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Andi and Cal Risen, who own the restaurant and are longtime friends of the 
Smiths, will receive $110,000 from the state for selling the winning ticket.

FLEISS IS ORDERED INTO DRUG TREATMENT; COURTS: THE ALLEGED MADAM IS TO SPEND 
TIME IN A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM AFTER TESTING POSITIVE -- A VIOLATION OF BAIL 
TERMS. 'I WANT TO GO HOME,' SHE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss was ordered into residential drug 
treatment Monday after testing positive for drugs six times since August, 
violating the terms of her $50,000 bail in an income tax evasion case. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, who was arrested Thursday and has been in jail since, groaned, "I want 
to go home" as the hearing drew to a close and it became evident that she would 
stay in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall said Fleiss will enroll at Impact House, 
a Pasadena rehabilitation facility, "if Impact is willing to take her and has 
enough beds." If not, Fleiss will enter another program. She will remain in 
custody until she is transferred to a program, which may take one or two days, 
lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss and her father await a federal trial, scheduled to begin Dec. 6, on the 
tax evasion charges, and she faces trial in state court on pandering and drug 
charges, for which jury selection is to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Marks, Fleiss' attorney, argued that his client should be "given a 
second chance," saying the drugs for which she tested positive are not "hard 
drugs," such as cocaine or heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks said he did not contest the charge that Fleiss used drugs in violation 
of her bail. He noted that she has a prescription for Valium, but said he did 
not know if drugs from that prescription produced the positive test results. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fleiss tested positive for both Valium and methamphetamines, said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark Holscher. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks said the stress of Fleiss' upcoming trials "caused her to do things 
which are in violation of the bail terms and certainly very stupid and 
destructive." 
</P>
<P>
 He asked the judge to, at most, order Fleiss to undergo outpatient treatment. 
But Marshall ruled in favor of federal prosecutors and pretrial services 
officials who asked that she receive residential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Holscher said Fleiss has shown no remorse during her probation about her drug 
use. "Before her attorneys got involved, she claimed that someone spiked her 
(Coca-Cola with drugs) at her birthday party," Holscher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, the alleged head of a pricey call girl ring said to have serviced many 
in the entertainment world, faces a maximum prison sentence of 12 years on 
state charges, and a maximum of 188 years in prison with a $5.5-million fine on 
federal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Dr. Paul Fleiss, could be sentenced to 305 years in prison and a 
maximum $9.2-million fine. Both have pleaded not guilty to all charges.

GIRL, 16, WOUNDED ON CAMPUS OF LOCKE HIGH; VIOLENCE: TWO OTHER YOUTHS ARE SHOT 
LATER NEAR THE SOUTH-CENTRAL SCHOOL. POLICE BLAME GANGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old girl was shot in the back while taking a nutrition break on a 
South-Central Los Angeles high school football field Monday morning, and two 
boys were wounded in a drive-by shooting just outside the campus later in the 
day, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings were the result of an apparent flare-up between rival gangs that 
spilled over onto the campus of Locke High School and continued that afternoon 
at the nearby intersection of 109th Street and Avalon Boulevard, said Los 
Angeles Police Lt. George Gascon. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, whose name was not released, was with a group of fellow students 
near the bleachers on the Locke campus about 10:30 a.m. when a gunman "either 
cut through or sneaked through a (chain-link) fence in the football field," 
Gascon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He yelled out some name -- we don't know what -- and she started to run," 
Gascon said. "He shot her twice, once in the back and once in the buttocks 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon said the shootings -- which occurred scarcely a week into the new 
school year -- apparently were the result of a gang skirmish that has gone on 
for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the victims in the later shootings also were teen-agers but 
did not appear to have been students at Locke. All three victims were taken to 
Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the girl was listed in satisfactory condition. They had only 
sketchy information about the wounded boys, whose names also were not released. 
However, authorities said, all three appeared to be victims of the same gang 
clash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some information that leads us to believe (the shootings) are all 
related," Gascon said, adding that the attacks were the latest in a string of 
shootings over the past several days. 
</P>
<P>
 School police had been aware of gang problems in the neighborhood but had not 
expected them to crop up on campus, said Assistant Chief Richard Page of the 
Los Angeles Unified School District police. 
</P>
<P>
 After the football field attack Monday morning, he said, patrols were beefed 
up on and around the campus, but the increased police presence failed to deter 
the second shooting just as school was letting out at 2:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Page said that since last year, the school's two on-site district police 
officers have done daily spot checks for weapons by scanning students at random 
with hand-held metal detectors. The two officers were on campus and on duty 
when the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Page added, "it's a large campus. They can't be everywhere at the same 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he said, "there's probably a million ways to get onto campus (with a 
gun)." He pointed out that the school itself does not have metal detectors at 
the door, and the on-campus shooting occurred near a parking lot.

FBI POST HEIGHTENS HER PROFILE; LEADERSHIP: KATHLEEN MCCHESNEY IS USED TO BEING 
WATCHED AS A FEMALE PIONEER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. NOW, AS HEAD OF THE BUREAU'S 
L.A. OFFICE, SHE IS THE AGENCY'S HIGHEST-RANKING FEMALE FIELD AGENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Kathleen McChesney is used to being watched. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the first woman police officer to go on patrol in the state of 
Washington, and camera crews from local TV stations followed her around for 
days in 1971. "When you're first at something you expect to be looked at," she 
reasoned 23 years later in an office on the top floor of the federal building 
in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then people watched McChesney for the novelty of seeing a slight young 
woman -- she had to gain seven pounds to go on patrol -- in a uniform worn 
almost exclusively by men. Nowadays a TV crew might tail her for a different 
reason. Her promotion to associate special agent in charge of the bureau's 
high-profile Los Angeles office has made her the FBI's highest ranking female 
field agent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles bureau, the largest branch outside of Washington, D.C., 
McChesney coordinates all investigations of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one woman outranks her in the hierarchy of the FBI, an agency that did 
not hire women as agents when McChesney landed her first job. 
</P>
<P>
 But she does not dwell on that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really think of myself as any different than men in this position," 
said McChesney, 43. "Women aren't in the fishbowl they used to be in 25 years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
 McChesney dived into that fishbowl in 1971, fresh out of the University of 
Washington. She decided on a career in law enforcement only after "I went 
through 12 majors." 
</P>
<P>
 A friend with the Seattle Police Department got her interested in becoming a 
police officer. She would talk to him about what he did each day, and listened 
carefully to his accounts. "I thought it was so interesting that he'd been 
involved in all these people's lives during the course of the day. . . ." she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She joined the King County, Wash., Police Department, working for a while at 
the county jail, doing clerical tasks and fingerprinting. She applied for work 
as a full-fledged officer, but was told she was "too small," she recalls, 
adding, "it was a very non-traditional occupation for a woman."  
</P>
<P>
 She appealed to the Civil Service Commission, which ruled that McChesney 
should be allowed on the force if she gained the requisite amount of weight. 
She did, and seven pounds later began seven years as a detective on the force, 
eventually investigating some of Ted Bundy's killings. 
</P>
<P>
 McChesney joined the FBI in 1978, six years after it began hiring women as 
agents, and began to climb rapidly through the ranks. She spent time at the 
main office in Washington, D.C., coordinating interstate investigations.  
</P>
<P>
 In May, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh appointed her to her current post in one 
of the FBI's most visible bureaus, one which has scored numerous high-profile 
successes in the past few years by helping to catch the nation's most wanted 
serial bank robber, foiling a skinhead plot to blow up a prominent black church 
and working to secure convictions of police officers in the Rodney G. King 
beating case. 
</P>
<P>
 McChesney is obviously elated with her position. "I'm in my goal," she said. 
"I have an excellent job in an excellent city." 
</P>
<P>
 The days when she had to persuade the citizens and police officers of King 
County that a woman could be a valuable law enforcement officer are long gone, 
McChesney said. Now more people accept women in uniform and treat them with 
respect.  
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is not whether you're the first female," McChesney said. 
"It's that you're not the last female, that you haven't performed so badly 
they'll paint other women with the same brush."

U.S. TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE CONFLICT WITH CASINO OVERSEERS; GAMBLING: MEETING WILL 
BE HELD WITH TRUSTEE AND ATTORNEY WHO HANDLED PURCHASE OFFERS FOR U.S. SHARE OF 
BICYCLE CLUB. THEIR NAMES APPEARED ON APPLICATIONS TO OPERATE THE CLUB. THE MEN 
HAVE DENIED ANY CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

 Federal officials said Monday they will not allow any conflict of interest by 
two men who oversee the Bicycle Club Casino for the U.S. government and were 
listed recently as part of a Santa Monica group buying the government's share 
in the club for nearly $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph L. Ilk, business manager of the U.S. Marshals Service Seized Assets 
Division in Washington, said officials plan to meet face-to-face this week with 
Harry J. Richard, the government's trustee at the Bicycle Club, and his legal 
counsel, Las Vegas attorney James F. Lisowski Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Sunday that Richard and Lisowski handled purchase offers 
from prospective buyers of the government's 36% interest in California's 
second-largest casino, located in Bell Gardens. After government officials 
selected Club Acquisition Partners as the winning bidder, gaming registration 
applications filed by 17 investors in the group listed Richard as their 
proposed casino manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show one application came from Lisowski, who applied to the state 
attorney general's office for registration as both an owner and manager of the 
Bicycle Club. Lisowski said he sent a letter to state officials last week 
withdrawing the application, but the letter has yet to be received in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials said they intend to make clear to Richard and Lisowski in 
the meeting that: "Either you represent us or you represent the other guys. You 
cannot do both," Ilk said. "We will not allow a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard denied Monday that any conflict of interest exists. "Nobody did 
anything wrong," he said. "I do not represent anybody but the federal 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 For there to be a conflict, Richard said, "there has to be a gain by one party 
and a loss to another party. I don't understand where there is a loss or gain 
to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard said he discussed with various bidders the possibility of staying on 
as the casino's general manager after the sale, but he had not reached any 
agreement to do so. He said he has no idea why his name would have been listed 
as manager by the Club Acquisition Partners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While he presented bids to a team of government officials, Richard said he was 
not involved in the actual selection of the winning bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilk acknowledged that Richard had been "up front" with government officials 
about having discussions with bidders about possibly remaining as casino 
manager. He said Richard told officials he would only consider a job offer 
after the final sale agreement had been signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisowski could not be reached for comment Monday. He said last week there was 
no conflict because he has no financial interest in Club Acquisition Partners. 
On his application form, Lisowski said the amount and percentage of his 
interest were "to be determined." 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials were pleased the application is being withdrawn. "It is 
discomforting, though, that the application was sent in," Ilk said. Government 
officials would consider any ownership interest to be a conflict of interest 
and want to discuss with Lisowski why the application was submitted in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, he said the government plans to proceed with the sale of its 
casino holding without reopening the process to other bidders. But the 
government will accept backup offers from other investment groups should the 
deal not be completed, Ilk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica group bid just under $38 million to acquire the government's 
controlling interest in the casino. The government seized the club in April, 
1990, after prosecutors proved that it was built in part with $12 million in 
laundered drug money from Florida.

PANEL TAKES NEW TACK ON QUAKE REPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Taking a new tack to rebuild the most vulnerable of quake "ghost town" 
buildings, a Los Angeles housing panel tentatively approved a $900,000 loan 
Monday to restore a crumbling Reseda apartment complex for low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 City housing officials say the loan is the first of its kind, aimed at 
producing low-income housing by salvaging financially troubled buildings, 
primarily within the 15 designated ghost towns.Those structures would otherwise 
sit neglected for months, perhaps years, attracting graffiti, crime and vermin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to encourage the nonprofits to come out and eat these 
properties up," said Beth Bergman, a finance officer for the city's Housing 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan, which was approved by the City Council's Housing and Community 
Redevelopment Committee, would provide enough money for the Los Angeles 
Community Design Center to buy the severely damaged 64-unit apartment building 
at 7939 Reseda Boulevard. The nonprofit group has also requested a second loan 
for about $600,000 to rehabilitate the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire council must still give both loans a final approval, but no 
opposition is anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 The red-tagged building is located in the middle of a chain of vacant 
quake-damaged buildings along Reseda Boulevard and is already in foreclosure. 
It shifted off its foundation during the Jan. 17 quake and is now leaning 
noticeably, although a "Now Renting" sign remains on its front wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing officials say they are not sure how many damaged buildings may be 
turned into low-income housing projects, but they hope the strategy will save 
at least some of the hundreds of vacant apartment complexes that have become 
magnets for blight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of a long-term strategy," Bergman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the loan plan, the Los Angeles Community Design Center will redesign the 
buildings, reducing the number of units to 46 to allow for bigger apartments.

VALLEY, SOUTH L.A. CLASH AGAIN OVER QUAKE AID; RELIEF: COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE AT 
ODDS OVER HOW TO SPLIT $2.2 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS EARMARKED FOR SENIOR 
CITIZENS. ACTION IS EXPECTED WEDNESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For the second time in as many months, San Fernando Valley lawmakers are 
closing ranks in a bid to increase earthquake repair funding for the Valley at 
the expense of South Los Angeles communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The simmering dispute is expected to come to a head Wednesday, when the City 
Council is scheduled to decide how to distribute $2.2 million in federal grants 
to help senior citizens recover from the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The first sign of renewed conflict came last week when three Valley council 
members, acting as the Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake Recovery, recommended 
increasing the allocation for senior programs in the Valley and slashing the 
amount proposed for seniors in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 That move angered representatives from South Los Angeles, who said seniors in 
that area need help even though they did not suffer the heaviest quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get concerned when I see everybody talking about the earthquake in the 
Valley," said Councilwoman Rita Walters, whose district stretches from Downtown 
to South-Central. "Well, the (quake-damaged) Coliseum is the best example I 
know to show that we had an earthquake in South-Central." 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Webb de Macias, chief of staff for Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who 
represents parts of South Los Angeles, agreed. "There are needs in the southern 
part of the city and we should not subtract money from those areas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month Ridley-Thomas led a move to cut the Valley's share of $47 
million in housing funds and instead increase funding for housing citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 He engineered the switch when three Valley council members were absent. Later, 
after a long, contentious meeting, the council reversed itself and restored the 
full Valley allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest controversy began when a council committee headed by Walters 
approved a plan for the $2.2 million that set aside a lion's share for the 
Valley but also allotted $560,000 to four senior services centers in South Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When the proposal was forwarded to the Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake 
Recovery, Valley council members Richard Alarcon, Hal Bernson and Laura Chick 
voted to increase by $120,000 the funding to Valley senior services agencies 
while slashing $195,000 from senior centers in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview later, Alarcon, who represents parts of the northeast Valley, 
said he voted to cut the South Los Angeles funding because most quake damage 
was in the Valley, not in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it was warranted," he said. "I don't think there is anybody in Los 
Angeles who doesn't know the hardest hit areas were in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 The city Building and Safety Department estimated that about 75% of the $1.6 
billion in quake damage to the city's commercial and residential buildings was 
in the Valley and about 10% was in South Los Angeles areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some City Hall officials say a clash can easily be avoided because there is an 
additional $1.8 million set aside for the second year of the program that could 
be used to increase the funding for both the Valley and South Los Angeles this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need to go one against the other," said Councilman Joel Wachs, 
who represents parts of the northeast Valley. "There is still plenty there to 
spread around." 
</P>
<P>
 The money is distributed to senior service centers to help relocate seniors 
from damaged homes, fund repairs and provide legal assistance, among other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Franklin, director of the Theresa Lindsay Multipurpose Senior Center in 
South-Central, said he was shocked that the earthquake recovery panel 
recommended cutting the allocation to his agency from $140,000 to $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "That won't allow me to deal with all the earthquake-related issues that some 
of my seniors have," he said, adding that many senior citizens need to be 
relocated from their homes while cracked walls and broken windows are repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennistine Lyle, director of the Bradley Multipurpose Senior Center in 
South-Central, agreed. The panel recommended the same cut for her agency. "Just 
because the buildings didn't fall down doesn't mean we don't need assistance," 
she said.

FIGHTING WILDFIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your Sept. 5 editorial, "Fire Bill -- Pay Now or Pay Later," though on the 
mark, misses the real reason that something must be done to alleviate the 
terrible loss of natural resources: timber, grass, soil, watershed, man-made 
structures and wildlife habitat. The paltry $250,000 that L.A. County has 
committed to lease one CL-415 "Super Scooper" is but a fraction of the losses 
that generate from the long-term devastation of wildfires. What is destroyed in 
a matter of minutes cannot be restored for at least 100 years, and in the case 
of the 17 firefighters killed this year alone, together with the soil loss, can 
never be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the $250,000, many existing and never-used military aircraft could be 
modified to do the same thing as the CL-415, and the surplus military pilots 
are not only available, but are already on the payroll. This country can no 
longer tolerate the terrible loss as the result of wildfires, and must do 
everything humanly possible to bomb these destructive fires into submission at 
the onset.

 * Your editorial incorrectly states that my comments -- "the time has come for 
new tests of the 'Super Scooper' " -- do not reflect the views of Gov. Pete 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I was speaking on behalf of Wilson in making this statement. The 
state supports the tests planned by Los Angeles County Fire Department; my 
office is discussing possible federal support to extend the test period. 
</P>
<P>
 My comments on the "Super Scooper" also included the caveat that the plane 
should not be seen as -- your editorial seems to suggest -- a silver bullet 
that will definitely reduce losses from future fires. There are a limited 
number of water sources in the state that can be used by the "Super Scooper," 
and cost remains a very real consideration. For the cost of one "Super 
Scooper," approximately 10 fixed-wing aircraft could be added to the state's 
inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic reduction of fire losses will come through intelligent 
vegetation management, construction of fire-resistant residences and brush 
clearance around homes. Firefighting efforts -- utilizing the "Super Scooper" 
or other enhancements to training and operations -- will be inevitably limited 
if we fail to manage our fuel loads more effectively.

NINE HOSPITALS FORM HEALTH CARE NETWORK; MEDICINE: CEDARS-SINAI AND HUNTINGTON 
MEMORIAL ARE AMONG THOSE BANDING TOGETHER HOPING FOR MORE CLOUT WITH INSURERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine Southern California hospitals -- including such high-profile institutions 
as Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and Pasadena's Huntington 
Memorial Hospital -- said Monday that they have formed a new health care 
network they hope will give them more clout with insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 A key function of the PrimeHealth network will be to negotiate with insurers 
on behalf of the not-for-profit hospitals and about 3,000 affiliated doctors as 
a single entity. Hospital officials said they believe the strategy will help 
them secure better payment rates with HMOs and other managed-care insurers and 
ensure its hospitals and doctors a steady flow of HMO patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The PrimeHealth network is the most significant cooperative attempt by the 
region's major surgical hospitals to respond to the growing influence of 
managed care in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The network's lead hospitals -- Cedars, Huntington and Long Beach Memorial 
Medical Center -- have been hit hard by managed care's emphasis on reducing 
hospital admissions and costs. But industry observers said these hospitals have 
guarded their independence while smaller competitors reacted more quickly to 
industry changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides negotiating contracts, network members say, they will cooperate to 
enhance patient care, streamline costs and improve their competitiveness during 
a period of health reform and the fast-growing influence of HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers said the PrimeHealth group could prove attractive to employers and 
insurers because of the prestige of its lead hospitals and its geographic reach 
from south Orange County to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one HMO official said the network would have limited appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Folick, president of California operations for PacifiCare Health Systems, 
a Cypress-based HMO, said PacifiCare has refused to negotiate with similar 
health care networks unless the hospitals and doctors actually merge and become 
a single legal entity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think hardly any HMOs will work with them on that basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard B. Jacobs, president of Voluntary Hospitals of America West and a 
key PrimeHealth organizer, said the group wants to work cooperatively with 
health plans to lower costs and improve the quality of patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our interest is not to be a bully; that's not going to work," Jacobs said. 
"What we're attempting to say here is that while these insurers are important 
to the Southern California health care industry, we're important too." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the concept has received a "very positive" response from insurers.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the network is successful at snagging HMO contracts away from other 
Southland hospitals, it could help accelerate consolidation in the industry, 
health care officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's longstanding glut of hospital beds has been growing worse, and 
most experts predict a wave of hospital closings during the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said the network will offer employers, insurers and 
patients a broad choice of medical groups and doctors throughout Los Angeles 
and Orange counties. The 11 medical groups participating in PrimeHealth are 
affiliated with the nine hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "In effect, instead of just being covered by a single hospital or medical 
group, a PrimeHealth patient will be covered by every member of the network," 
Jacobs said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the PrimeHealth members are working together to standardize care for 
patients and measure the quality of services. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Weiner, a health care consultant at Foster Higgins in Los Angeles, said 
the PrimeHealth group will appeal to HMOs because it includes some of the most 
prestigious tertiary care hospitals in the region. Tertiary care hospitals are 
those that generally deal with the sickest patients requiring highly 
sophisticated care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you have an almost perfect network set up for the California employer," 
Weiner said. "But in the past, these hospitals haven't been the lowest-cost 
facilities, though they are certainly quality ones.  
</P>
<P>
 "The real key in their negotiations with managed-care plans will be how 
cost-efficiently they can deliver services," Weiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other hospitals in the PrimeHealth network are Anaheim Memorial Hospital, 
Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, 
Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital, Methodist Hospital of Southern California 
and Valley Presbyterian Hospital.

ALPO PURCHASE MAY MAKE NESTLE TOP DOG IN PET FOOD INDUSTRY; ACQUISITIONS: A 
PENDING $510-MILLION CASH DEAL WOULD GIVE IT A BIGGER BITE OF OVERALL U.S. 
MARKET, EDGING OUT NO. 1 RALSTON PURINA. 
</P>

<P>
 Nestle USA Inc., best known as the maker of chocolate candy bars, Taster's 
Choice coffees and Stouffer's frozen foods, moved Monday to capture market 
share among customers who walk on all fours and eat from plastic bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 In a deal that analysts said should vault the company to the top of the 
cluttered pet food industry, Nestle agreed to acquire Alpo Petfoods from 
London-based Grand Metropolitan for $510 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction, subject to legal and regulatory approval, would give Nestle 
17.1% of the market in the $8.4-billion U.S. pet food industry, narrowly edging 
out Ralston Purina, which has 17.0% market share.  
</P>
<P>
 Nestle's Friskies PetCare Division is already a market leader in canned cat 
food, with its Friskies, Fancy Feast and other brands. But the purchase of Alpo 
would enable Nestle USA, the Glendale-based unit of Swiss food giant Nestle, to 
enhance its somewhat weaker presence in the dog food market, where it offers 
Mighty Dog and Come'N Get It brands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alpo is one of the most recognized consumer brands of dog food," said Joe 
Weller, chief executive of Nestle USA. "The Alpo brand conveys quality to 
consumers and will enable us to compete more effectively against the market 
leaders in the dog food segment of the pet food industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition should boost Nestle to the No. 2 position in the canned dog 
food market, with market share jumping from 9% to 25%, said Nomi Ghez, a food 
industry analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Co. The current leader is Mars Inc., 
maker of Kal Kan.  
</P>
<P>
 Alpo's smaller cat food business should boost Nestle's share of canned cat 
food sales from 33% to 41%, Ghez said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Grand Metropolitan, the sale of Alpo means leaving the pet food market 
altogether to focus on the leading consumer foods brands -- including Pillsbury 
baked foods, Green Giant canned goods and Haagen-Dazs ice cream -- that make up 
its Pillsbury Co. subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Walsh, chief executive of Minneapolis-based Pillsbury, said in a written 
statement that Alpo's middle-of-the-pack position in the pet food industry made 
it a strategic misfit with the company's higher-profile food brands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective is to maintain No. 1 or 2 positions in our major businesses," 
Walsh said. "Alpo has been the exception." 
</P>
<P>
 Allentown, Pa.-based Alpo, acquired by Grand Metropolitan in 1980, will post 
operating profit of $47 million on sales of $430 million for its fiscal year 
ending Sept. 30. A company spokesman said revenue has been flat in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction was seen as a closing of the ranks in an industry that 
analysts say is ripe for consolidations. While most food categories are 
dominated by two or three companies, half a dozen large companies and a number 
of smaller labels compete in the pet food industry, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In breakfast cereals, to be No. 1 you have to have about 35% market share," 
said Les Pugh, an analyst with Salomon Bros. "Here we're talking about No. 1 
with 17% share." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is facing increased cost pressures, Pugh said, because growth in 
sales volume has slowed in recent years and the number of pet food retailers 
has expanded and become more specialized. "You're dealing with a much wider 
array of operators who clearly demand exceedingly competitive terms," Pugh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By combining Alpo with its Friskies division, Nestle advances its market 
share, but it should also achieve significant cost savings, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The businesses are very similar, and you probably have a lot of duplication," 
Ghez said. "You probably don't need all the salesmen and employees that Grand 
Metropolitan currently employs." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie MacDonald, a spokeswoman for Nestle, said the company will spend the 
next few months considering how best to integrate the businesses. She said it 
is "too early to talk about any changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nestle had sales of $39.1 billion last year, including $7.2 billion in sales 
at its Nestle USA subsidiary, MacDonald said. Pet Food Market Share 
</P>
<P>
 With its acquisition of Alpo, Nestle will edge past Ralston Purina with 17.1%

ENERGY SUPPLIER MAKES OFFER FOR COMPETITOR MAGMA POWER; ENERGY: IF THE 
$840-MILLION OFFER IS ACCEPTED, THE DEAL WOULD MERGE THE NATION'S TWO LARGEST 
GEOTHERMAL PRODUCERS.

 In a bid to buy one of its major competitors, California Energy Co. made an 
unsolicited $840-million tender offer Monday for San Diego-based Magma Power 
Co. -- a deal that would merge the nation's two largest independent geothermal 
energy producers. 
</P>
<P>
 California Energy offered $35 a share for each of Magma Power's 24 million 
outstanding common shares, consisting of $25 in cash and $10 in California 
Energy common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace Dieckmann, chief financial officer for Magma Power, said he could not 
comment on the offer because his company had not yet received the California 
Energy proposal. Magma Power has 350 employees, of whom 35 work at the 
company's headquarters in San Diego and the remainder at power plants in the 
Imperial Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading in both companies' stock was halted late Monday pending news of the 
acquisition offer. California Energy shares were unchanged at $17 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, while Magma Power shares were down $.75 at $27.50 in 
over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
 California Energy, based in Omaha, spelled out its tender offer in a letter 
Monday from its chairman, David Sokol, to Magma Power's chief executive and 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sokol said the companies have discussed a business combination on several 
occasions and that he hoped the transaction could be completed on a friendly 
basis. But he warned that his company was prepared to go directly to Magma's 
shareholders with a tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
 California Energy has more than $300 million cash on hand, Sokol said, and 
should have no difficulty acquiring additional financing for the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are, of course, prepared to negotiate in good faith all aspects of our 
proposal and to work out the terms in a mutually satisfactory merger agreement, 
containing terms and conditions typical for a transaction of this type," Sokol 
said in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wall Street energy analyst who asked not to be identified said both 
companies are competing in the booming geothermal markets in the Far East. A 
merger might cut costs and reduce competition for California Energy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies are looking to the Philippines and Indonesia for future growth. 
Magma Power recently signed a deal to operate a 216-megawatt plant on the 
Philippine island of Leyte to be completed in 1997 pending financing 
arrangements. California Energy has deals to build plants totaling 300 
megawatts in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two of us used to compete in the domestic U.S. market for power 
generation," Sokol said. "The market has shifted very dramatically in the last 
year to where our primary growth prospects are international. It is a very 
different marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Magma Power operates seven geothermal plants in Imperial Valley that generate 
244 megawatts of power. Last year, the company reported profits of $52.1 
million on revenue of $167 million. It sells all of its energy to Southern 
California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Magma Power is 21% owned by Dow Chemical, whose engineers developed the 
technology that harnessed the Imperial Valley's superheated brines -- fluids 
thick with dissolved solids that circulate below ground at temperatures of up 
to 550 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Magma also owns or leases about 200,000 acres for possible future geothermal 
development. Magma Power's management in recent years has been dominated by 
ex-Dow Chemical executives. 
</P>
<P>
 California Energy operates six geothermal plants that generate 300 megawatts 
of power, all but one of which are located in the Coso geothermal field near 
Mammoth Lakes. The company reported a profit of $42.5 million on revenue of 
$132 million last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the company's major shareholders is the Kiewit family, owners of an 
Omaha-based construction firm, Peter Kiewit Sons.

PROFILE; FED'S BLINDER: BALANCING THE LEFT AND RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Alan Blinder, it has been a disorienting summer. 
</P>
<P>
 When it began, he was a member of a White House economic team characterized in 
a best-selling book as overly conservative. Blinder and his colleagues, wrote 
journalist-author Bob Woodward in "The Agenda," had coerced President Clinton 
into abandoning his liberal campaign pledges and focusing instead on deficit 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 By Labor Day, Blinder was being characterized as a closet liberal, a 
Democratic outrider in his new institutional home, the Federal Reserve Board. 
Press accounts portrayed the Fed's new vice chairman as indifferent to the 
risks of inflation and overly preoccupied with the impact of interest rate 
increases on jobs and employment. 
</P>
<P>
 A magazine columnist, reacting to a recent speech by Blinder about 
unemployment, proclaimed him unfit to succeed Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman. 
Inside the clubby central bank, some conservatives clucked that Blinder, the 
first Democrat appointed to the Fed in 14 years, might hurt their credibility 
where they believe it matters most -- on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 To be attacked from both ends of the political spectrum within the space of a 
few months is a rare feat for an economics professor from Princeton with little 
avowed interest in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was seen as being a moderate or slightly to the right of center in the 
White House, but here I'm seen as being left of center," Blinder sighed in an 
interview last week. "I can understand it, because at the White House everyone 
is a Democrat, and I was slightly to the right of center there. The Fed is a 
conservative institution, and the center is different here than it is at the 
White House."  
</P>
<P>
 It was an important revelation for Blinder and one that helped him recognize 
the need to pay more attention to how he is portrayed publicly at the Fed. 
Somewhat naively, Blinder thought he had left such spin-control concerns behind 
when he escaped the hothouse environment at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference between the White House and the Fed is like night and day," 
Blinder observed in his quiet office along the marbled corridors of the Fed's 
headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you have time to think; there, everything was frenetic, and we worried 
all the time about message. Here, message has very little to do with what we do 
. . . but this episode shows that maybe I should be paying a little more 
attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a fact of life in official Washington: Perception -- even within the 
cloistered walls of the Fed -- has a nasty habit of becoming reality. And 
relearning that harsh lesson might help Blinder survive the recent flap and 
live up to initial expectations that he would succeed Greenspan as Fed chairman 
when his term expires in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy surrounding the 48-year-old economist reflects the nuances and 
subtleties buried deep in U.S. monetary policy. It flared up following news 
reports about Blinder's remarks at a Federal Reserve conference on unemployment 
in Jackson, Wyo., in late August. In a speech, Blinder said that over the short 
term, Fed policies designed to fight inflation can indeed cost jobs, but over 
long periods of time he believes there is no real impact on employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, central banks, or more generally, macroeconomic policies, do 
indeed have a role in reducing unemployment as well as in reducing inflation" 
in the short run, Blinder said in Wyoming. But efforts to fine-tune monetary 
policy appear to have no long-lasting effects on unemployment, he added, and 
lax money policies eventually lead to higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where employment is concerned, macroeconomics is everything in the short run 
but nothing in the long run," Blinder warned. 
</P>
<P>
 To many economists and Clinton Administration officials, Blinder's remarks 
were not that startling. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the White House 
Council of Economic Advisers, described them as coming straight out of the 
economic textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his speech created quite a stir among some Fed officials. It 
particularly rankled those who hold the conservative view that even talking 
about the possibility of a trade-off between inflation and employment threatens 
to undermine the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy was fanned by a New York Times article suggesting that the 
Jackson Hole address reflected a rift between Blinder and Greenspan over 
monetary policy. It noted that Greenspan has suggested publicly that the Fed's 
only objective should be fighting inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 That story, in turn, prompted Newsweek economic columnist Robert J. Samuelson 
to charge that Blinder is "soft on inflation." Then the Wall Street Journal's 
conservative editorial page chided that "we've all enjoyed the spectacle of 
Alan Blinder's education as a central banker." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all economic experts found Blinder's comments objectionable. Some were 
surprised that the press had portrayed the issue as a Greenspan-Blinder battle. 
After all, they noted, Blinder's first major decision since joining the Fed was 
to vote with Greenspan in mid-August to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The consensus in the profession is that there is a short-run trade-off 
between inflation and unemployment," noted Allen Sinai, chief global economist 
at Lehman Bros. "There is an argument over how long that will last, whether it 
is one or two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I thought it was OK for Blinder to remind people (of that trade-off). 
That doesn't mean he is soft on inflation. And I don't think there is any rift 
between Blinder and Greenspan now. There might be some intellectual nuances or 
differences between them, but there is no reason Blinder and Greenspan have to 
talk and think exactly alike." 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder dismisses the whole controversy as a "tempest in a teapot." 
Nonetheless, he felt compelled to talk to Greenspan about the alleged rift. 
Both agreed there is no fundamental difference between them on monetary policy, 
Blinder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan declined to comment on the matter, and a Fed spokesman said the 
central bank had no official comment either. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his initial hazing, Blinder said he doesn't regret making the move 
from the White House to the Fed. What he gave up in access to the President, he 
has more than made up in increased independence and authority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a long career at Princeton, Blinder served intermittently as an economic 
adviser to the Clinton campaign in 1992, then joined the new Administration as 
Tyson's deputy at the Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder played a pivotal role in a wide range of policy fronts: He helped 
shape Clinton's 1993 economic plan, and served as a member of the negotiating 
team sent to Japan to hammer out an agreement on a new framework for bilateral 
trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder also brought to the White House a skeptical eye on the subject of 
health care reform. Early on, he privately raised many of the concerns that 
helped sink the Administration plan when it finally reached Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 When a vacancy on the Fed's seven-member board of governors appeared early 
this year, the White House offered the post to Blinder, but he rejected it. 
When the Fed vice chairmanship opened up a few weeks later, Blinder was more 
interested. The position offered greater status and increased power -- and the 
possibility of succeeding Greenspan when his second term as chairman expires in 
March, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he assumed his new post in June, Blinder was already being 
assailed by Fed watchers who had read his past columns in Business Week. The 
critics characterized him as a liberal who might upset the delicate 
conservative balance within the Fed. His Wyoming comments fanned those flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the Jackson Hole flap has any lasting impact on Blinder's credibility 
as a Fed member or his standing as Greenspan's heir apparent is still unclear. 
Even critics say it all will be forgotten if Blinder recognizes it was a 
learning experience, and realizes that his words now carry more weight than 
they did when he was a professor at Princeton.

GREEN TAPE; ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY'S REALITY FALLS SHORT OF HYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If business success were a popularity contest, environmental technology would 
be a winner. The industry is trumpeted by the likes of Vice President Al Gore 
and Gov. Pete Wilson. Its growth seems inevitable, and few would quibble with 
its aims: It's not every business that can claim it's out to save the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 But for local companies, the reality doesn't quite match the hype. Turning 
environmental technology into a new, green engine for job growth in California 
is tougher than it looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hampered tremendously by being here," complains Inderjit Sabherwal, 
president of Ensotech Inc., a toxic-waste cleanup firm in Sun Valley. Due 
mostly to frustration with state enforcement of rules governing soil and water 
cleanup, Sabherwal said, he is considering moving his 20-year-old business out 
of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southland has scores of environmental businesses -- those that prevent, 
detect, monitor and clean up pollution or offer green alternatives to 
activities that harm the environment. Thanks to strict pollution laws -- and to 
armies of unemployed engineers -- the Los Angeles area is home to the nation's 
second-biggest concentration of environmental technology companies in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many of those companies, the going is tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few giant concerns -- from Fluor Corp. in Irvine to Lockheed Corp. 
and Rockwell International's Rocketdyne unit in the San Fernando Valley -- are 
in the business, most of the companies are small. Their expansion is limited by 
an array of obstacles, from lack of capital to inconsistent enforcement of 
environmental laws. The recession has also taken a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, five years ago, Sabherwal says, his company had annual sales of 
$5 million and a staff of 60. Today, sales have dropped to $4 million and staff 
has dropped to about 30. He blames the recession in part, but says, too, that 
the state is slower than it used to be in pressing companies to clean up toxic 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Uziel of Enviropro Inc., a Chatsworth firm specializing in 
hazardous-waste cleanup, says sales have fallen off in the last three years, to 
about $3 million. The Clinton presidency and state programs aimed at fostering 
the industry have been of little help, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen W. Dykema, a 65-year-old former Rocketdyne engineer who has spent the 
last 15 years honing his invention for burning coal without producing acid 
rain, is just about out of money. He's still searching for that elusive 
investor he needs to bring his product to market. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these business people are particularly rankled by regulatory problems. 
Common themes are the slow pace of state approvals for cleanup and excessive 
testing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a company such as Ensotech can remove and treat, say, lead-tainted 
dirt, complicated negotiations must be conducted with the agency in charge -- 
usually the state Department of Toxic Substances Control or regional water 
quality boards. Local fire departments, water districts or county health 
departments often have to sign off, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabherwal tells the story of his company's efforts to dispose of piles of 
oil-contaminated dirt scraped from lands owned by a San Diego public agency. 
After more than a year of inconclusive talks, the client finally loaded the 
soil on a train bound for a landfill in Utah, where hazardous-waste statutes 
aren't as tough. 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Strock, California secretary of environmental protection, says 
enforcement of state regulations has been steady. But he acknowledges problems 
with cleanup approvals. "In California, we have the highest environmental 
standards in the world," Strock says. "But we also have one of the most 
convoluted permitting systems." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason many companies are having trouble is that, as the industry has 
matured, market growth has tapered off. At the same time, competition has 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
 The competitive atmosphere has created an arms race of innovation, as 
companies struggle to meet client demands for cheaper and quicker ways to clean 
waste. But they run into roadblocks because they lack the capital needed to 
develop and market new products. 
</P>
<P>
 Uziel, for instance, has spent $350,000 developing a method of cleaning 
tainted soil by shooting microwaves through it. He thinks the technique could 
drastically cut the costs of cleaning up petroleum and other toxins. But he 
must find a partner, because he can't afford the $3 million he says it would 
cost to market it himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy government involvement in cleanups discourages private investment, 
according to Don Hichens, general partner with Liberty Environmental Partners. 
The San Francisco-based firm is one of only about half a dozen U.S. venture 
capital firms that specialize in funding environmental technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Air-pollution technology has been somewhat more successful in drawing 
investment because of California's long track record with strict air pollution 
standards, ample room for innovation and support from government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, investors prefer putting their money behind market-driven 
pollution products, such as recycling and prevention technology, Hichens says. 
An example of preventive technology is Rocketdyne's new $1.3-million aqueous 
cleaning facility, scheduled to open in Canoga Park in November. The operation 
uses ultrasound waves, rather than polluting solvents, to remove grime from 
engine parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, innovation is more likely to come from small start-up firms than from 
big defense companies or engineering firms, says Hichens. And there are many 
such companies around. 
</P>
<P>
 Working from a tiny office in his West Hills home, for example, Dykema spends 
his days hunting for a foreign partner with the means to test and market his 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 His idea, first developed at Rocketdyne, is to smolder coal in a fuel-rich 
chamber before burning. The gas mix and temperature are manipulated so that 
polluting compounds such as sulfur form a solid. The remaining coal is 
relatively sulfur-free and can be burned without releasing the chemical into 
the air, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykema's plan requires a $30-million retrofit of 17-story coal-burning plants. 
Although a small-scale prototype of such a boiler has been built, the method 
has never been tested in a full-sized utility plant, Dykema says. With just 
$10,000 left in his business's bank account, Dykema says, he'll give up by 
year's end if he doesn't find a partner. 
</P>
<P>
 What the environmental industry "really excels at is getting to the point 
where I am," he says. "Where we really fall down is getting from here to the 
market."

 Azerbaijan Oil Deal Near: A consortium led by British Petroleum, and including 
Amoco Corp. and Unocal Corp., expects to sign a landmark $7-billion deal today 
with the Azerbaijan state oil company Socar, which promises to open up the 
region to Western investment.Azerbaijan will receive about 80% of the proceeds 
in a production-sharing scheme over 30 years. The remainder will go to the 
consortium. The consortium will also make an initial bonus payment to 
Azerbaijan once the contract is signed and further payments as development 
targets are met, sources said. Two huge offshore fields in the Caspian Sea, 
known as Azeri and Chirag, contain an estimated 4 billion barrels of crude oil.

 AT&T Closes Deal for McCaw: Having cleared a final hurdle, the 
telecommunications firm closed a $12.6-billion deal to acquire McCaw Cellular 
Communications Inc. The action came hours after the FCC gave a green light to 
the merger, 13 months after it was proposed.The commission approved the 
transfer of dozens of cellular licenses held by McCaw, the country's largest 
cellular phone operator, to AT&T Co. FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said the merger 
will "increase competition for cellular services." The commission imposed a 
number of requirements to ensure that the companies act competitively, mostly 
involving the sale of AT&T equipment to competitors.

WESTERN UNION AUCTIONED FOR $1.15 BILLION; BANKRUPTCY: FIRST FINANCIAL 
MANAGEMENT WINS UNUSUAL OPEN-COURT BIDDING FOR THE MONEY TRANSFER COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Financial Management Corp. won the bidding for money transfer company 
Western Union Corp. on Monday with a $1.153-billion offer, a Bankruptcy Court 
judge said at the end of an unusual open-court auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Union, owned by New Valley Corp. of Upper Saddle River, N.J., is being 
sold to satisfy its creditors as part of New Valley's Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
filing. The bidding reached such high levels that New Valley's creditors should 
be repaid in full. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, this long process is over and the marketplace seems to have won. This 
seems to be the highest and best offer for the company," Bankruptcy Judge 
Novalyn Winfield told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta-based First Financial beat out rival Forstmann Little & Co., which 
dropped out of the bidding at $1.143 billion. First Data Corp. of Hackensack, 
N.J., also pulled out of the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 First Data, a huge credit card processing company, opened up the takeover 
battle in June when it bid $660 million for Western Union. The bids had been 
rising ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 First Financial Management authorizes and processes credit cards, verifies 
checks, manages electronic databases, processes health care claims and collects 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
 It will get Western Union's 24,000 agents in more than 70 countries. Western 
Union is the largest money transfer business in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all very pleased at the outcome and believe that the combination of 
our companies will greatly improve our financial picture in the future," said 
Christopher Trowler, an attorney for First Financial Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Although its parent is in bankruptcy, Western Union is in sound financial 
shape. It also has growth prospects that make it an enticing target, analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 All bidders were required to submit their final offers on Sept. 16, but the 
court allowed the auction to continue openly in the courtroom Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Creditors, who will be repaid at 100 cents on the dollar for their debts, said 
they were pleased with the outcome. Carl Icahn, who owns about $80 million 
worth of New Valley bonds, said: "This open bidding is terrific. I think it 
should be adopted in other bankruptcy cases." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he bought the bonds at 20 cents to 30 cents on the dollar.

BUT SPECULATION CENTERS ON STRIFE WITH BOARD MEMBER.

 In a surprise announcement, Micron Technology Inc. said Monday that Chief 
Executive Joe Parkinson and two other top officers will resign from the 
computer chip company for "personal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Top officers of Micron's largest subsidiary, the chip-making operation, were 
named to lead the entire company.Micron, the world's ninth-largest maker of 
computer memory chips, has performed well in recent years, and analysts were at 
a loss to explain the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, when you watch a company, you see some shuffling around that 
suggests a transition," said Jim Handy, principal analyst at Dataquest Inc. in 
San Jose. "We didn't see anything that indicated to us there would be any 
change that way here." 
</P>
<P>
 Company spokeswoman Julie Nash said she could not elaborate on the 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
 Market analysts said speculation centered on upper management's disagreements 
with agricultural magnate J.R. Simplot, a Micron board member and an original 
investor in the company. They said he has lobbied Micron management for a 
common dividend higher than the current 5 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
 Micron closed down $1.75 at $39.675 on the New York Stock Exchange. The 
resignations were announced after the market closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Micron employs 5,300 people in Boise, Ida., and earned $259 million on sales 
of $1.14 billion during the nine months ended June 2.

CLASS-ACTION SUIT OKD IN ALLEGED INSURANCE SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of victims of an alleged health insurance scam -- known as 
Consolidated Local 867 -- won a legal victory when a federal judge in New York 
City certified their lawsuit as a class action. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 13 ruling by U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack means that the 
claims of an estimated 10,000 people nationwide -- about three-quarters of them 
Californians -- are now consolidated into one case with a common set of 
defendants: the 650-plus insurance agents who sold them the allegedly phony 
health policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Damages, including unpaid medical claims and premiums for worthless insurance, 
total at least $35 million, said Timothy Cohelan, a San Diego attorney 
representing the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs, as well as insurance regulators and criminal prosecutors in 
several states, contend that Consolidated Local 867 was a sham labor union 
created as a vehicle to sell phony group health policies to people whose 
medical problems made it impossible for them to find coverage elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, in early 1990, Local 867 offered coverage through Empire Blue 
Cross/Blue Shield of New York, but Empire terminated that agreement in August, 
1990, the plaintiffs' lawyers said in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next three years, Local 867 "rolled over" its clients into "a series 
of unlicensed, insolvent, offshore insurers," according to the statement. 
Cohelan said these allegedly fraudulent insurers included Winston Hill 
Assurance Co. Ltd., Old American Insurance Co. Ltd., First Assurance & Casualty 
Co. Ltd. and Meadowlark Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Pollack will oversee settlement discussions next Monday, Cohelan said. 
He said the plaintiffs will go to trial against any defendants who refuse to 
settle and will try to bring the alleged organizers of the fraud into the case 
as defendants at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 William Loeb, one of the founders of Local 867, is now serving a seven-year 
prison sentence in New York State on federal fraud charges related to the 
alleged scam. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers handling the class action are Cohelan, of Cohelan & Khoury in San 
Diego, and Robert L. (Rusty) Brace of Hollister & Brace in Santa Barbara.

 GE Denies Seeking Time Warner: Amid a swirl of rumors that it is trying to 
sell all or part of its NBC television network, General Electric Co. said it is 
not in talks with Time Warner Inc. about a possible purchase of the media 
company. The stock of Time Warner rose on a USA Today report that GE was 
considering acquiring Time Warner for $19 billion, or $50 a share.Despite GE's 
denial, Time Warner stock closed $1.375 higher at $37.625 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, while GE, a conglomerate with interests ranging from aircraft engines 
to NBC, was 75 cents lower at $50.25. The USA Today report that GE was 
interested in Time Warner comes after weeks of intense speculation that all of 
the three major networks may be up for grabs.

 Administration Predicts Trade Pact Approval: Legislation to implement a 
worldwide trade agreement will be introduced next week and is likely to be 
approved by Congress before it adjourns for the year, Administration officials 
predicted.Passage of the legislation would help California once again "become 
the engine of growth in this country," Special Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor told a group of state business and labor leaders at a Washington seminar 
organized by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). The legislation would cut tariffs 
by an average of 40%, expand overseas markets for consumer goods and simplify a 
vast array of complex regulations.

 Apple Appeal on Windows Rejected: The decision in Apple Computer Inc.'s 
nine-year copyright battle against Microsoft Corp. upheld lower-court rulings.A 
three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco 
cleared Microsoft of charges it infringed Apple's copyright protection with the 
highly successful Windows software operating system. It also rejected Apple's 
claims against Hewlett-Packard Co., which marketed Windows-based software. The 
appeals court then remanded the case to the lower courts to determine whether 
Apple should be asked to pay attorney's fees for Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. 
The three companies spent millions of dollars fighting the landmark case. None 
had any immediate comment.

 Allen Sells America Online Stake: Billionaire investor Paul Allen said he has 
sold his entire stake in the fastest-growing long-distance computer network 
company.Allen, who at one point owned about 1.4 million shares, or 18%, of the 
company, sold his remaining 568,000 shares. His stake was once valued at $120 
million. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft Corp. with Bill Gates, had cut his 
stake to 7.87% from about 9.7%, after selling 130,000 America Online Inc. 
shares last week, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. At 
one time, Allen had said he might try to acquire America Online, but his 
attempts to obtain a seat on its board of directors were rebuffed.

 FCC Sets Date for Phone Auction: Federal regulators said they will auction the 
first batch of licenses in December for a new phone service providing a single 
number for home, work or anywhere else.Ninety-nine licenses will be put on the 
block beginning Dec. 5, the Federal Communications Commission said. The 
announcement dispelled concern among some potential bidders that the auction 
could end up being put off until early next year. The licenses, which will 
allow companies to provide a mobile telephone service that is supposed to be 
cheaper and more mobile than existing cellular service, will cover 51 
geographic areas, including Los Angeles-San Diego.

 House of Fabrics Gets Reprieve: The troubled Sherman Oaks-based fabric 
retailer said its bank lenders have agreed to waive "all existing and certain 
future defaults" through Nov. 11, giving it time to pursue a capital 
restructuring.The agreement also allows House of Fabrics to maintain its 
borrowing base at 60% of its inventory value through Jan. 30, rather than the 
55% rate that had been scheduled to take effect at the end of August. Last 
month, the company reported an $11.6-million loss for its fiscal second quarter 
on a 15% decline in revenue to $110 million. It announced plans to close 200 of 
its 624 stores by the end of January.

 Some Banks Fail to Warn Fund Investors, Agency Says: The Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency said some banks continue to do a poor job of giving 
investors written warning that the mutual funds and other investments bankers 
sell are not federally insured and could go sour. The government review shows 
that many of the marketing and advertising materials voluntarily turned over by 
more than 700 national banks for OCC review violated federal banking guidelines 
issued last year.

EXPERTS SAY BABY BOOMERS SAVE TOO LITTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many baby boomers will face a nasty financial surprise when they retire 
because they're saving too little and not investing wisely, financial experts 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a retirement crisis in America," said Carter Beese, a 
commissioner with the Securities and Exchange Commission, at a conference on 
financial markets and the economy hosted by Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Security will be worth "little more than food stamps when the baby 
boomers retire," he warned. Even now, many retirees have a hard time supporting 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the elderly have no savings and depend on Social Security, 
said Karen Ferguson, executive director of the Pension Rights Center. The 
median income of people over 65 is just $10,200, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution is to scrap the entire system, including Social Security, and 
allow people to make their own investments for the future, said Franco 
Modigliani, an economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a 
1985 winner of the Nobel Prize in economics. 
</P>
<P>
 But many people fail to invest money wisely, said Peter Lynch, a mutual fund 
manager and vice chairman of Fidelity Investments Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Some invest too conservatively in money market instruments or in the bond 
market, despite the fact that the stock market outperforms those investments, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said only half of employees' tax-exempt savings for retirement under 401(k) 
plans are targeted toward stocks, below what he would advise clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, trying to increase returns on their money, are putting their savings 
in investments that prove riskier than they thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the generation born after World War II has many economic advantages 
over their parents, said Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional 
Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Baby boomers have higher rates of income, thanks to more dual-income 
households and better education, he said. But they also are burdened by the 
nation's fiscal crisis and rising health care costs.

PANEL URGES REVISED GUIDELINES FOR MOBILE HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A government commission is recommending sweeping changes in regulations 
governing the mobile home industry, including extensive warranties to ensure 
safer and more durable homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Commission on Manufactured Housing said Monday that it sent a 
195-page report to Congress that also suggests streamlining the building code 
process and updating outmoded requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations include a five-year warranty against structural problems, 
including those resulting from faulty installation or transportation of the 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 They would also require a one-year warranty for all defects, including those 
caused by rain or snow leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the commission report says, most manufacturers' warranties do not 
cover installation. Most retailers offer no warranty at all, it says, even 
though installation problems are the most frequent source of complaints 
involving mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said about one of every four new single-family homes sold today 
is a mobile home.

COMPANY TOWN; PRODUCERS DOUGLAS, REUTHER FIND GERMAN TYCOON TO BACK FILMS; 
MOVIES: THE INJECTION OF MONEY WILL HELP THE PAIR MEET AN AMBITIOUS PRODUCTION 
DEAL WITH PARAMOUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of speculation about how they planned to finance their new film 
production company, producers Michael Douglas and Steve Reuther said Monday 
that their ambitious 12-picture, four-year deal will be backed by German 
entertainment tycoon Bodo Scriba. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at their new offices on the Paramount Pictures lot, the two 
added that Douglas has committed to star in three of the 12 films, with budgets 
averaging $35 million to $40 million. Close to $500 million in production funds 
will be arranged by the Hamburg-based Scriba. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas added that he might also be interested in directing a film if the 
right project comes along. At least eight of the 12 pictures are expected to be 
financed solely by Douglas/Reuther Productions, with all of the films 
distributed by Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal represents a major departure for Paramount, which in the past was so 
cash rich that it almost always financed its pictures in-house to keep all of 
the rights. That changed in part because of the studio's $10-billion 
acquisition by Viacom Inc. and the debt levels that resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom Entertainment Group Chairman Jonathan Dolgen, who oversees the studio, 
has been receptive to such deals, which are becoming more common in Hollywood 
as studios seek to spread their risk, lower their average production costs and 
boost the number of films they distribute. 
</P>
<P>
 For producers such as Douglas and Reuther, independent financing offers 
freedom to make the kind of films they want and carries with it a huge upside 
financially if they have a major hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, as an actor and producer, and Reuther as a producer have been 
involved in a number of successes through their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas starred in "Basic Instinct," produced the Oscar-winning "One Flew Over 
the Cuckoo's Nest" and won an Oscar as best actor for his role in "Wall 
Street." As the former president of Regency Productions, Reuther was involved 
in such hits as "Pretty Woman," "The Client" and "Under Siege." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, one of Hollywood's top-paid stars, said he hopes to use the new 
venture to better mesh his careers as an actor and producer. "I have the 
opportunity to grow my two careers closer together. To control your own destiny 
and to call your own shots is an excellent opportunity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas and Reuther dismissed recent talk that their deal had encountered 
troubles, including rumors that they were recently out soliciting bank 
financing. Indeed, Douglas said that he even assured Paramount that if all else 
failed, he would personally finance their first two projects, "Sabrina" and 
'Stuart Smalley." 
</P>
<P>
 The two said that the financing environment remains tight internationally 
since there is so much competition, but Douglas' willingness to star in some of 
the films was an effective calling card. The two said they looked at three 
potential partners before settling on Scriba, declining to name the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas and Reuther both said they chose Scriba in part because they are 
comfortable working with him. He is a former partner at Regency, but was 
replaced earlier this year by Australian billionaire Kerry Packer.

exchange student from Finland, who finished third in 18 minutes 33 seconds to 
help Irvine edge Palos Verdes Peninsula, ranked No. 2 in the section Division I 
preseason poll, in the Division I race."I really think as she gains confidence, 
she's going to continue to improve and move on up," Irvine Coach Randy Rossi 
said.

 Last season Cherrington gained 327 yards in a game against Dana Hills. Friday, 
he again got loose in a big way, rushing for 279 yards and four touchdowns in a 
34-23 victory over Bellflower. Cherrington also returned a kickoff 92 yards for 
a touchdown, giving the Falcons a 21-17 lead late in the third quarter.And he 
caught a pass for 17 yards, giving him 388 yards in total offense. "He did it 
all," Santa Ana Valley Coach Scott Orloff said. "He had the big plays for us 
all night long." Cherrington has gained more than 2,500 yards in his three-year 
career, putting him about 1,600 yards behind school record-holder Myron White, 
who rushed for 4,164 from 1972-74.

PREP EXTRA; NOTEBOOK; CHERRINGTON MAKING THE BIGGEST PLAYS 
</P>

 So, who is the big-play guy this season? So far, it's Dwayne Cherrington of 
Santa Ana Valley. He has scored six touchdowns this season, and the average 
length of each has been 51.3 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherrington's average is slightly better than Savanna's Daven King, whose four 
touchdowns have covered an average of 51 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Among county players with four scores or more, the leaders include Corona del 
Mar's Brian Hogan (four touchdowns, 44.24 yards), Westminster's Leonard Ibarra 
(four, 39.25), Costa Mesa's DeWayne Crenshaw (five, 38.0), Laguna Hills' 
Brendan McGraw (seven, 33.1), Los Amigos' Greg Fausto (seven, 33.0) and 
Esperanza's Brian Forth (four, 33.0).

 Dana Hills' football team takes in a team movie and meal together before its 
games and invites along its male and female teacher of the week. And the 
Dolphins are eating well -- at the Chart House in Dana Point and Beach Cities 
Pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to implement the family philosophy that ties into not only what we 
do here, but also the family," first-year Coach Trace Deneke said. "The 
football team can be a branch of their own family unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It defuses so many situations. When people break bread together, it has a 
bonding effect; it breaks down barriers." 
</P>
<P>
 Deneke also said there are selfish reasons, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a real football program, " he said. "We want something to draw kids, 
that tells them we do special things together." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those is the team movie, but they're on a strict time schedule. Before 
its season opener against Aliso Niguel, Dolphin players watched the Arnold 
Schwarzenegger movie "True Lies." But they had to leave just as Jaime Lee 
Curtis was doing her striptease for Arnold. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sam Peek never wore a Dana Hills football jersey in a game, but he was issued 
a number by coaches to wear during his freshman season. Now, all three 
programs, including varsity, will wear his number -- 89 -- on their helmets. 
Peek died Sept. 7 in a storage yard fire one day before the team's first game.

 Inflation? Fans of Santa Margarita's football team could deserve a rebate. The 
Eagles opened the season at Trabuco Hills and faced a discrepancy at the 
concession stands. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the field, soft drinks cost $1. On the other side, they were 
$1.50. Guess which side was charged the extra 50 cents? 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently someone grabbed a sign from last year," Trabuco Hills Activities 
Director Sharon Farris said. "It was a mistake. I think we corrected it before 
the game ended. We'll definitely have it correct in the future." 
</P>

 Nonverbal communication note of the week, meaning that actions speak louder 
than words, belongs to Estancia, which ended its nine-game losing streak with a 
31-0 victory over La Quinta. With the Aztecs at the 13-yard line, poised to 
score their only touchdown, Estancia put its starters in for the final play. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta quarterback Jason Gondringer was sacked, and didn't get up for about 
a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shutout wasn't that important -- what was important was the win," 
Estancia Coach John Liebengood said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defensive coordinator (Ben Carpenter) wanted to get the shutout, so we 
got some better people in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently, the shutout was important, and Carpenter didn't have enough faith 
in his reserves to stop La Quinta for one play from 13 yards. 
</P>

<P>
 Los Alamitos quarterback Kevin Feterik's injury in Week 1 wasn't lost on the 
team's defense in the second half of its 24-14 victory over Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to step it up," defensive linemen Dax Houston said afterward. "We have 
a tradition here at Los Alamitos and we did what we expect ourselves to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense helped the Griffins stretch its unbeaten streak to 37 Friday with 
a 38-7 victory over L.A. Washington. The defense, and replacement quarterback 
Sean Stein, should get a stiff challenge Thursday against Carson.

 John Halagan, Woodbridge basketball coach, was at the Warriors' football 
opener, but he didn't rest easy. Not with his junior point guard, Ricky 
Jenkins, starting both ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on pins and needles all night," Halagan said. "I just hope he plays as 
well on the hardwood as he does on the grass." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night in Woodbridge's second game, Jenkins broke his collarbone on the 
game's third play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins was the replacement quarterback for the Warriors, who lost starter 
Casey Harris on the second play of their 14-7 victory over eighth-ranked 
Foothill. Harris sprained his knee on the game's second play.

 The girls' tennis showdown between No. 1 Laguna Beach and No. 2 Newport Harbor 
never materialized Friday because of a scheduling conflict -- the Artists were 
also supposed to play El Toro. The match against the Sailors will go off Sept. 
27 at Newport Harbor.

 Bob McAllister, a Westminster High assistant in the 1980s, has Carlsbad off to 
its best start in four years after its 17-14 victory Friday at San Clemente. 
The Lancers (2-0) are ranked fifth in San Diego County by the San Diego Union, 
their first top-five ranking in more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all really pleased with the efforts of Bob McAllister," Carlsbad 
Athletic Director Mark Nelson said. "It's fun to watch what's going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsbad began the season unranked but upset third-ranked Vista, 32-7, in its 
opener. McAllister had been an assistant at Vista for five years before he took 
the Carlsbad job. The Lancers had not finished better than .500 in the previous 
eight seasons.

 Myron Miller has decided to accept the boys' athletic director position again 
at Costa Mesa High. He stepped down last year, citing overload from coaching 
football and wrestling, and teaching. The school has since hired Ralph 
Stansbury to coach wrestling. Stansbury coached at Newport Harbor from 1974 to 
1980 and since then has been a wrestling official. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Miller is back.

PREP EXTRA; SCENES FROM A FALL FRIDAY NIGHT

 It's only mid-September, but there was a playoff-type atmosphere surrounding 
the football showdown between second-ranked Mater Dei and third-ranked 
Esperanza at the Valencia High School stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, a standing-room-only crowd of more than 5,000 jammed the stadium.Some 
Mater Dei fans couldn't find a seat, so they stood and cheered for the Monarchs 
behind a fence in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 And it didn't take the Monarchs long to visit those fans in the southern end 
zone. On their opening drive, quarterback John Flynn moved the Monarchs 80 
yards in six plays, and fullback Joey Trampush scored the game's first 
touchdown on a one-yard run 2 minutes 17 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs, who rushed for 291 yards, almost turned the game into a laugher. 
They scored the first 17 points before taking a 24-7 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offensive line won the game," Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson said. "I 
thought we dominated the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Esperanza dominated Mater Dei, shocking the top-ranked Monarchs, 
33-7, at Santa Ana Stadium in front of 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Aztec fans were hoping for a repeat performance, and they saw a glimmer 
of hope in a hard-hitting second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza running back Dahrin Footman rushed for one touchdown and quarterback 
Chris Stretch threw two touchdown passes to Brian Forth. The Aztecs cut the 
lead to 31-28 with 2:46 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Mater Dei recovered an onside kick, running back Steve Bodnar iced 
the 38-28 victory by scoring the final touchdown with 41 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The weary face of Esperanza defensive lineman Sean Jarne (inset) reflected the 
Aztecs' disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were two good teams," Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said. "We just came out 
on the short end tonight." MICHAEL ITAGAKI

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; CARTER AND CEDRAS: GLIMPSES INTO STATE OF THEIR MINDS 
AS DRAMA UNFOLDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>

 "The U.S. invasion will cause much less bloodshed than the civil strife that 
will result with the return of Aristide. He was never a democrat and has asked 
for an invasion of his own country. His forces are just waiting to attack the 
general populace." 
</P>
<P>
 The speaker was Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, Haiti's de facto leader, in a telephone 
call he placed last Wednesday to former President Jimmy Carter in an effort to 
persuade Carter to travel to Haiti to head off the invasion that President 
Clinton had threatened. He was referring to Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was 
ousted by a coup led by Cedras a year after his election as Haiti's president 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after the telephone conversation, Clinton said in a televised address 
to the United States that an invasion was inevitable unless Cedras gave up 
power. A day after that, Clinton announced that he was dispatching Carter to 
Haiti, a mission that resulted in agreement Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone conversation between Carter and Cedras offers fascinating 
glimpses into the state of mind of the two men -- and what each wanted the 
other to believe. Carter took notes on the conversation. Here are excerpts from 
those notes: 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras: "We have civilian government in Haiti under (President Emile) 
Jonassaint, a respected and experienced public servant. There is no military 
government. My role is to defend my country. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Carter: "I do not represent the U.S. government, but it is necessary for me to 
tell you the truth. An irrevocable decision has been made to invade Haiti 
unless you and the two other leaders are prepared to leave. It will be helpful, 
if you also welcome the U.N. forces to come in to preserve order . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras: ". . . As a Christian and nationalistic Haitian, I will do everything 
possible to avoid any problem for my country. My long career has not prepared 
me for this situation. . . . The decision to invade will come from your 
President. I will do my duty to my country. How will history judge me, if I 
depart and leave my fellow citizens to face death? The U.S. is determined to 
put Aristide back in power. He has no vision of democracy. He burned 19 of our 
soldiers to death in January, 1991. Is this your vision of democracy? 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . This invasion will only complete the genocide of our people begun three 
years ago with the embargo on food and medicines." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter: "I said, to summarize: My proposal is that Gen. Cedras agrees to leave 
immediately. . . . My understanding is that Gen. Cedras will not agree to 
leave, and this ensures an invasion. Is this correct?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras: "What will be your attitude if I announce my departure, and a civil 
war erupts?" 
</P>
<P>
 Carter: "I hope you will use your great influence to call for peace from the 
other leaders in Haiti and from the public. I will be glad to come to Haiti to 
get you." 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras: "I cannot appear to be abandoning my country. I am not a deserter. . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's notes conclude: ". . . We discussed mutual respect and faith in God. 
I invited him to come to my Sunday school class, either to hear me or to teach 
it. He said my image in his mind was shaking hands with (former Israeli Prime 
Minister Menachem) Begin and (former Egyptian President Anwar) Sadat. In 
closing, I urged him to discuss my proposals and consider them carefully."

OREGON GETS FINAL GO-AHEAD TO BEGIN WELFARE EXPERIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration gave Oregon final approval Monday to begin 
subsidizing private jobs for thousands of single mothers on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon's welfare experiment, known as JOBS Plus, cleared its final federal 
hurdle after 11 months of negotiations between state and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The road to welfare reform is pitted with entrenched opponents who pull out 
all the stops for the status quo," said Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who had 
lobbied the Administration to approve JOBS Plus. 
</P>
<P>
 Waivers of federal rules were required because Oregon will convert food stamps 
and Aid to Families With Dependent Children into cash and then use the money to 
subsidize temporary jobs for welfare recipients, most of them single mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will be paid no less than the Oregon minimum wage, $4.75 an hour, 
and will be eligible to receive the earned income tax credit, which effectively 
pushes their hourly earnings above $6. 
</P>
<P>
 JOBS Plus is expected to place as many as 5,000 welfare recipients into "real 
work" jobs, most of them private and some public, over the next three years. 
Each position lasts six to nine months, and the experiment's sponsors believe 
that the on-the-job experience will lead participants to permanent positions at 
the end of their apprenticeship. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a paycheck, participants will receive health insurance and 
assistance with child care and transportation, and each will have an 
"individual education account" to continue education after finding unsubsidized 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wyden's office, banks, plumbing, shipping, manufacturing and 
electronics companies have expressed interest in participating. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agriculture Department had approved JOBS Plus earlier this summer, and 
Monday the Health and Human Services Department gave the state permission to 
launch the experiment.

PROPOSED SMOKING BAN PROMPTS IRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has forwarded to the FBI threatening letters 
received by the Labor Department in response to its proposal to restrict 
smoking in the nation's workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a few letters that were over the line," Joe Dear, head of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said OSHA, a division of the Labor Department, received an estimated 
100,000 correspondences after proposing in March new regulations that would 
require employers to provide separately ventilated rooms for smokers or ban 
smoking altogether. Dear said the contents of 12 letters was considered 
threatening enough to call in the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether any of the letters contained death threats, Dear responded, "We 
interpreted them that way." He did not provide a text of any of the letters. 
</P>
<P>
 The volume of correspondence and the irate tone of some pieces demonstrate the 
level of emotion stirred by the proposed smoking regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency will begin protracted hearings on the proposal today. It could be 
several years before final regulations are issued.

 Two men disguised as security guards entered the back room of an ATM branch of 
Citibank on Monday and stole $848,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch has 12 automated teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers appeared at the back door just as employees were putting money 
into the machines. The employees, thinking they were guards, let them into the 
room.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: DEFENSE ATTACK ON INVESTIGATORS' CREDIBILITY HOLDS 
ECHOES OF THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In attacking the credibility of the Los Angeles police and the county 
coroner's office, O.J. Simpson's attorneys are playing to suspicions of the 
investigative ability of both agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 As former district attorney and state Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp told me 
recently, "There is greater skepticism about the veracity of police. Police are 
being treated more as regular witnesses today rather than coming in with a 
presumption of total integrity and honesty." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the coroner's office, Van de Kamp said: "We had very mixed experiences 
when I was D.A. . . . Their ability to testify is not first-rate." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attack has been taking place since the case began. But it became 
clearer and sharper Monday in the first of a series of pretrial hearings that 
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito is holding this week. Among other things, the 
purpose is to decide whether to toss out evidence collected by the police prior 
to obtaining a warrant to search Simpson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing a morning of arguments, Ito rejected the defense's request for 
dismissal of murder charges against Simpson for the killings of his former 
wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. The former football 
star has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's decision was expected. Defense attorneys Robert L. Shapiro and Gerald M. 
Uelman had asked for dismissal on the grounds that police work was allegedly 
sloppy and that the prosecution's case doesn't make sense. It is a rare judge 
who goes along with such motions. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad issue of investigatory competence will arise later this week in 
connection with other defense motions, and during the trial itself. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Shapiro blasted homicide detectives for waiting too long to call 
the coroner. Then he went on to assail the coroner's office. "We are forever 
excluded from knowing the time of death," he said. "The coroner simply threw 
away the contents of the stomachs, which is one of the best ways of determining 
time of death." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark sharply defended the investigation. Speaking 
of the homicide detectives, she said: "We have investigators. They are not 
lawyers who nit-pick their way through every nuance." 
</P>
<P>
 But she might have done better with a more thoughtful reply. For, as Van de 
Kamp said, neither the LAPD nor the coroner's office are given automatic 
credibility on the witness stand these days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This feeling has been particularly strong in the Latino and African American 
communities, where activists have long criticized the criminal justice system 
here for what they say is unfair treatment of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The feuds between the LAPD and other police agencies and minority communities 
have been well-publicized. What is not as well-known is that both communities 
have also strongly attacked the way the coroner investigated two cases that 
remain burned into the memories of members of both groups. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the death of journalist Ruben Salazar, who was killed when sheriff's 
deputies fired tear gas into an East Los Angeles bar during an anti-war 
demonstration in 1970. The missile struck and killed Salazar. Latino activists 
said that Salazar, a powerful advocate for the Latino community, was 
assassinated. The cops said it was an accident. Three members of a coroner's 
jury supported the accident theory, while four others said only that Salazar 
died "at the hands of another." It was a result that left many in the community 
suspicious of law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The second involved Leonard Deadwyler, a black man who was shot and killed by 
a Los Angeles police officer. The cop had stopped Deadwyler's car while he was 
rushing his pregnant wife to a hospital in 1966, a year after the Watts riot. A 
coroner's jury agreed with the police version, that the death was justified. 
The decision came in a televised inquest that further polarized a racially 
divided city and left the black community more embittered against law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In a third well-known case, however, a coroner's jury sided with African 
American residents suspicious of the police. That involved the death of Ron 
Settles, a black Cal State Long Beach football star who was found hanged in his 
cell in the Signal Hill jail after being arrested for speeding. The Signal Hill 
cops insisted that Settles hanged himself. But the jury ruled that Settles had 
died "at the hands of another." His family was awarded $760,000 in a wrongful 
death suit settled in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer for the survivors of both Settles and Deadwyler was Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr., one of the lead attorneys representing Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Cochran made his name in the Deadwyler case. An African American 
community still traumatized by Watts watched with pride as the young black 
lawyer tore into the law enforcement establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, older and smarter, Cochran is going after the Simpson case investigators, 
both in the courtroom and in the media. This attack has been heard in African 
American and Latino neighborhoods, many of whose residents remember or have 
heard of Ruben Salazar and Leonard Deadwyler. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the history helps explain the direction of the attack.

NOW URGES BOYCOTT TO PRESS PENSACOLA TO PROTECT CLINICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Organization for Women has called for an economic boycott of 
Pensacola if the city does not establish protection around its two abortion 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Two doctors and an unarmed escort have been shot to death outside Pensacola 
clinics since March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of what's missing in Pensacola is the political will to stop this 
violence," NOW president Patricia Ireland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's national board on Sunday unanimously approved a boycott of 
Pensacola as "a last resort." The board did not discuss details of the boycott, 
did not set a deadline and did not mention what other steps it would first take 
to persuade the city to adopt a buffer-zone ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The boycott still would have to be approved by NOW's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
 A buffer-zone ordinance would reserve an area in front of the clinics that 
abortion protesters could not enter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pensacola Mayor John Fogg said the City Council was not opposed to such a law, 
but wasn't sure it could pass legal muster. Courts have disagreed about the 
constitutionality of such zones, although the U.S. Supreme Court in July upheld 
one in Melbourne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that if the City Council passes a buffer zone, it is certainly going 
to be challenged up to the Supreme Court, and it is going to cost the city 
hundreds of thousands of dollars" to defend, Fogg said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the threatened boycott would not sway the city's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This community, like any other, cannot be held hostage by NOW," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 NOW's vote comes in response to the July 29 slayings of Dr. John Bayard 
Britton and his escort, James Barrett, outside the Ladies Center clinic. 
Barrett's wife, June, was wounded in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Presbyterian minister Paul Hill, 40, awaits trial. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a jury was selected to hear disorderly conduct and noise charges 
against Hill in another case. He is accused of disrupting the Ladies Center on 
June 17 by loudly shouting such statements as "Please don't kill your innocent 
child" and "Mommy, mommy, why can't you love me?" 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, Dr. David Gunn was shot to death outside the city's other 
clinic. Michael F. Griffin is serving a life sentence.

OXNARD YOUTHS MAY GET A VOICE IN CITY POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Young, aspiring politicos may wield influence in Oxnard City Hall faster than 
they ever thought possible as part of a proposed city Youth Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council today will consider creating a commission composed of 
21 young leaders from city schools, clubs and associations. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, modeled after similar bodies in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, 
would suggest programs and offer advice to Oxnard officials on city issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be more of a formal opportunity for young people to address their 
views and their needs," said Jim Faulconer, director of the city's recreation 
and community services. "It serves as a new vehicle for youth to get involved 
in their city and their own issues and problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the ideas proposed to fall under the auspices of the Youth Commission 
are preparing a year-round calendar of children's events, honoring youngsters 
for their civic contributions, starting a youth newspaper and television 
program and creating a youth month during which kids "assume control of city 
government" and install an ersatz mayor, police chief and department heads.  
</P>
<P>
 The difficult part of the plan, city officials said, will be making sure the 
fledgling politicians understand the limits of their power and do not let it go 
to their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to create a logical agenda for youngsters, you have to consult 
them," said Efren Gorre, who runs Oxnard's Summer Youth Employment and Training 
Program. "The challenge of dealing with youngsters is that you have to give 
them guidance sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Andres Herrera said the plan is a great way to involve the 
city's youth in Oxnard's politics. But he cautioned that adults need to oversee 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm assuming that we're going to have adult supervision," Herrera said. "But 
I think kids will be able to express their views and provide input, which is 
the point of the commission. We have so many resources in our young people." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials in the past few months have discussed the plan with young 
people in city programs such as the Youth and Work Newspaper Project, the 
Summer Youth Corps and the Police Athletic League. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff also sought opinions from El Concilio del Condado de Ventura, a 
Latino advocacy group, the Oxnard Union High School District and the Boys & 
Girls Club of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Most children and teen-agers were enthusiastic about the concept. The adults 
were too, but some wanted to make sure commission members have well-defined 
responsibilities, following guidelines and bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we want to cast everything in stone," Faulconer said. "(But) 
ultimately there would be a set of bylaws and goals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Youth Commission, the brainchild of Councilman Bedford Pinkard, would cost 
$6,500 to start, according to city estimates. But city leaders say it will be 
cost-effective because commission members could help officials determine what 
youths need from the city and what is expendable.

COUNTY HOUSING SALES UP 18% FROM JULY TO AUGUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County housing sales shot up 18% from July to August, continuing an 
18-month resurgence that has defied a rise in home mortgage rates, according to 
figures released Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're at the point where we don't even have enough product anymore," said 
Kathy White, an agent with Brown-Realtors in Westlake. "All the agents are 
complaining that there isn't enough out there."  
</P>
<P>
 Buyers continue to snap up homes at the fastest pace since the recession began 
in 1990, apparently undeterred by a 30-year fixed interest rate that has 
climbed nearly 2 percentage points in a year to just under 9%, according to 
TRW-REDI Property Data. 
</P>
<P>
 County homeowners sold 982 houses and condominiums in August, compared to 834 
the month before and 832 in August, 1993, TRW-REDI reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers seem to be spurred by bargain prices and by a fear that interest rates 
will surge even higher -- not by an improving overall economy, some agents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those that are out there, they are a kind of now-or-never type, and that's 
what concerns me," said Bob Harrison, the manager of Ventura's Coldwell Banker 
Town & Country. The supply of that kind of buyer is probably limited, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Santa Barbara economist Mark Schniepp agreed that the "current real estate 
surge is temporary unless the economic situation changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Without an increase in jobs, the real estate boom will falter, he said. There 
were 234,600 jobs countywide in August, down 300 from a year before. 
</P>
<P>
 County home sales increased by 19% during the first eight months of this year 
compared to the same period in 1993. That is about the same as in Los Angeles 
County and San Diego County, but less than in Orange County, which saw a 26.2% 
increase, and in Riverside County, where sales rose 23.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the region, housing prices were almost unchanged from last year, 
TRW-REDI reported. In Ventura County, prices dropped about 2% from August, 
1993, to August, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But some communities saw prices fall more dramatically. In Ojai, for example, 
prices for new and used single-family homes and condominiums fell by 17% 
between August, 1993, and August, 1994 to $226,250. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People are pretty hesitant," said Carol Martin, an agent with Ojai's Century 
21 Hibberd Realtors. "Most of your buyers are looking for bargains." 
</P>
<P>
 Few communities saw prices rise much. In Oak Park, however, the average home 
cost rose nearly $23,000 to $305,408 in August compared to the same month last 
year, the company reported. Whitesaid her company's office is flooded with 
buyers looking to move to the fast-growing community east of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of it has to do with the fact that that school system over there has 
gotten so much publicity with their distinguished school awards over the last 
few years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the county's most affordable areas was Oxnard, where average prices 
ranged from $148,621 in south Oxnard to $248,846 in the Mandalay Bay community. 
The new figures show that home prices also averaged under $200,000 in Fillmore, 
Oak View, Port Hueneme, Santa Paula and mid-town Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most expensive neighborhoods were eastern Thousand Oaks, Bell Canyon 
near Simi Valley and eastern Camarillo. Ventura County House Sales

JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN O'SULLIVAN KIDNAP-MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jury selection got under way Monday in the death-penalty trial of Mark Scott 
Thornton, the Thousand Oaks man charged with kidnaping and slaying Westlake 
nurse Kellie O'Sullivan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning an expected four-week process, Judge Charles R. McGrath summoned 112 
prospective jurors to his courtroom for potential duty in the trial, expected 
to last four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half told the judge that service in the lengthy case would cause them a 
financial hardship and were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the end of the day, more than 60 jurors had survived the initial part 
of the arduous process. Lawyers in the case hope to have another 120 jurors who 
have survived the financial hardship question by the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys hope to then cut that group in half by questioning them on their 
views toward the death penalty. Jurors with fixed attitudes either for or 
against capital punishment will be dismissed at that stage, said Deputy Public 
Defender Susan R. Olson, one of Thornton's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 That would leave the group pared to about 90 prospective jurors. Each side 
will then disqualify 20 people using what are called peremptory challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 A final panel of 12 regular jurors and four alternates will be chosen to hear 
the case from those who remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers in the case said they expect the trial to begin in late October or 
early November, depending on how well jury selection goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any idea when jury selection is going to end," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton is accused of kidnaping and murdering O'Sullivan, the mother of a 
young son, on Sept. 14, 1993. Police say the woman was abducted in Thousand 
Oaks, taken to the Santa Monica Mountains and shot twice in the back and once 
in the chest. Thornton also stole her 1991 Ford Explorer, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 After the killing, prosecutors say, Thornton kidnaped his ex-girlfriend, shot 
at the girl's mother and fled to Reno, Nev., where he was arrested five days 
later at the Circus Circus Hotel and Casino. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan's partly decomposed body was not discovered until six days after 
Thornton's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he summoned the first group of 56 jurors to his courtroom Monday, 
McGrath ordered reporters covering the trial out of the courtroom, saying later 
that he decided to ban the media because all space in the courtroom was needed 
for the jury panel. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Monday morning, however, after some of the potential jurors were 
dismissed and seats opened up in the courtroom, McGrath permitted the media to 
re-enter the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's initial closure of the jury selection process followed a series of 
decisions by the judge blocking the media and public from court proceedings and 
documents. He earlier held several pretrial hearings in his chambers and out of 
the view of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has allowed prosecutors and defense attorneys to file motions that 
pertain to evidence in the case under seal, and has refused to release grand 
jury transcripts on grounds that they could prejudice the Thornton trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, McGrath told reporters Monday that they would not be permitted to 
inspect a copy of a questionnaire that is being handed out to jurors who do not 
have a hardship that prevents them from being considered for service in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the jurors who was excused from service Monday was Rebecca Carman, a 
24-year-old Moorpark College student. Outside court, Carman said her school 
schedule would prevent her from serving four months on the jury. Other jurors 
had similar reasons for wanting to get off the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost all of them wanted to get off because it's going to take four months," 
said Carman, carrying a book bag. "But if you're going to be on a jury, you 
want to get on one like this." 
</P>
<P>
 A second panel of 56 prospective jurors was called to the courtroom Monday 
afternoon. Like the first group of prospective jurors, about half the people on 
the second panel also wanted off. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a firm stance, McGrath told them that a hardship applied only to 
circumstances that might make it difficult for them to serve on the jury -- and 
not on any condition that would inconvenience their employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell me that the school district needs you, the hospital needs you, 
or they need you at Mugu. But I'm not going to excuse you," the judge warned. 
</P>
<P>
 One man was excused after saying that he is a ticket writer at a local carwash 
and only gets paid on commission. If he serves on the Thornton jury, he said, 
he would not get a pay check for four months. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath excused another man, who said he has non-refundable airplane tickets 
for a vacation in November and December. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman was excused when she told the judge that she is a homemaker and 
responsible for taking her small children to day care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we only have one income. And if I had to pay day care to shuttle 
them back and forth, we wouldn't eat," she declared.

WILSON SIGNS BENEFITS BILL FOR WORKERS' FAMILIES; LAWS: SURVIVORS OF TWO STATE 
EMPLOYEES GUNNED DOWN IN DECEMBER AT THE OXNARD UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE WILL BE 
COMPENSATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Monday signed legislation giving lifetime benefits to 
families of state workers slain on the job, starting with the survivors of two 
people gunned down at the Oxnard unemployment office last December. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law brought a measure of financial relief to the families of Phillip 
Villegas, 43, of Oxnard and Anna Velasco, 42, of Fillmore, who were killed Dec. 
2 when a gunman burst into the state Employment Development Department office 
in Oxnard and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Villegas, whose husband of 25 years was killed in the shootings, said 
Monday that she was elated that the bill had been signed. But she was saddened 
to think it took the deaths of two Ventura County residents to bring about a 
law that provides surviving spouses 50% of the deceased employee's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful gesture," she said. "But of course no amount of money will 
ever replace Phillip." Villegas, whose two children are college students living 
at home, said her husband's income is "sorely missed." 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the Velasco family declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Three others died in the tragedy, jobs counselor Richard Bateman, Oxnard 
Police Detective James O'Brien and the gunman, Alan Winterbourne, who was shot 
to death by police. Bateman worked for the Assn. of Retarded Citizens, not the 
state, and thus his wife does not qualify for benefits under the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 Four others were wounded but survived the shooting, which was apparently 
spurred by Winterbourne's frustration over repeated job rejections. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's author, state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) said he was 
"delighted" that the governor signed the legislation after Hart wrote him a 
lengthy letter seeking his support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted, particularly in memory of the workers in Oxnard, and the 
family members who lost spouses there," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, drafted with language to include the Oxnard survivors, 
extends lifetime benefits to all state employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, only police officers and select other public safety workers were 
eligible for such benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really unfair to make the distinction that there's one set of benefits 
for some public safety workers and a completely different standard for murdered 
workers who aren't police officers," Hart said. He noted that desk workers, 
too, have to deal at times with irate members of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was the equity issue, in fact, that won the bill critical support from the 
California Taxpayers Assn., the influential lobbying group known as Cal-Tax 
that typically opposes bills to increase worker benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an endorsement from a conservative watchdog group made it easier for 
Wilson to sign a bill that increases the state's spending, even if a minimal 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor was thrilled that we supported it," said Rebecca K. Taylor, 
Cal-Tax senior vice president. "I think he was correct in signing it. A benefit 
shouldn't go with a person, it should go with a situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Arredondo, a spokesman for Wilson, said, "The governor knows that this 
bill will help protect the few families of state and local employees killed 
while providing a service to the citizens of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Arredondo said Wilson was aware the benefit was already available to peace 
officers, and felt it therefore should be extended to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Irma Lopez, a state worker who was wounded in the hip during the shootings and 
who continues to battle bouts of severe sciatic nerve pain, said it is only 
fair that the benefits should be extended to state office workers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When these laws were created, we never thought that other state employees 
would be killed by violence in the workplace," said Lopez, who organized a 
letter-writing campaign in support of the bill. "It's just a sign of what's 
going on in our society now." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the new law, if a state worker is killed on the job in an act of 
violence, a surviving spouse will get a monthly allowance until death, 
regardless of whether he or she remarries. The allowance is 50% of the 
employee's average monthly salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Current law provided survivors with 50% of the highest annual salary for six 
months, a $5,000 insurance lump sum and retirement benefits with interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's staff estimated the bill's annual cost at under $50,000 to $100,000 a 
year because deliberate killings of state workers in the line of duty are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, it appeared as if the bill might become too costly to be passed 
by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Cal-Tax and the Wilson Administration briefly opposed the bill after 
amendments were added to include highway maintenance workers -- a separate 
classification of state workers -- as beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hart ultimately dropped the amendments, and the bill passed both houses of 
the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Hart, Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and Assemblyman Jack 
O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) voted for the bill. Assemblywoman Paula Boland 
(R-Granada Hills) voted against the bill and Assemblyman Nao Takasugi 
(R-Oxnard) abstained.

CITY TO UNVEIL SCALED-BACK GROWTH PLAN; ORMOND BEACH: OXNARD WILL ANNOUNCE 
TODAY THE LATEST PROPOSAL FOR THE 1,200-ACRE SITE. A DEVELOPER WANTS TO BUILD A 
HOUSING PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of haggling with a developer over a gargantuan housing project at 
Ormond Beach, Oxnard officials will unveil a rival plan today with drastically 
reduced expectations for the 1,200-acre area. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects will present the Oxnard City Council with a scaled-down development 
proposal for Ormond Beach that includes high-rise beachfront condominiums, an 
aqua-farming parcel, a pier, a marina and a 100-acre theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders originally had even bigger plans for the area: a 7,000-seat 
amphitheater, an aquarium and a 700-acre amusement park akin to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin Co., which owns a portion of Ormond Beach, had a different idea 
early on: 10,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have amended their plans in the last two years, with Baldwin seeking 
fewer homes and the city opting for a less extravagant entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest proposal comes after the council asked city staff to devise a plan 
for Ormond Beach that contained a major tourist draw and took into account the 
area's fragile wetlands, said Oxnard Community Development Director Richard 
Maggio. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked for a pier, a clearer program for wetlands and their restoration 
and . . . a commercial recreation area that could have the potential for an 
aqua park or theme park," Maggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also wanted a different type of configuration for the residential areas, 
more of a neighborhood feel," he said. The city plan does not specify how many 
homes would be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Two consultants helped Oxnard officials draw up their proposal, which also 
includes a golf course, a school and park area and a hotel. Architect Norman 
Pfieffer of Hardy Holzman Pfieffer Associates, one of the two consulting firms, 
will present the project to the City Council today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based Baldwin Co. will unveil a revised plan of its own that 
includes 5,398 residences along with a hotel, an 18-hole golf course and a 
shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've made some refinements, but their plan hasn't changed much," Maggio 
said. "They're still talking about a lot of residential development." 
</P>
<P>
 Projects to develop Ormond Beach have been discussed around Oxnard City Hall 
since 1987. From the beginning, environmentalists have complained bitterly that 
the beach's wetlands -- where the California least tern and several other 
endangered species are flourishing -- would be wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California wetlands are unique," said Alan Sanders of the Ormond 
Beach Observers, an environmental watchdog group. "All of us need to ensure 
that there are at least a few places where natural order is preserved." 
</P>
<P>
 The current council revived plans to develop the area last year after a 
two-year hiatus. The city's revised plan contains an aquaculture area where 
abalone and lobsters may be raised, Maggio said.  
</P>
<P>
 An environmental impact report on development at Ormond Beach is under way and 
should be complete early next year. The City Council will then review the 
report -- which analyzes several proposals, including one with no development 
-- and choose a final plan for the area, Maggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about handcuffing the Baldwin Company," Councilman Andres 
Herrera said. "But at the same time, who needs another housing project? We want 
something that takes advantage of our coastal resources and preserves our 
environment but also provides something for the people of Oxnard." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental impact report on Ormond Beach development is due by early 
next year. The City Council will review the report and choose a final plan for 
the area.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; PORN ACTRESS PLEADS GUILTY IN 
MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 45-year-old Newbury Park porn actress will probably get probation after 
pleading guilty to molesting a 14-year-old boy, a prosecutor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty.Tom Connors said that Laurie Arden pleaded guilty Friday to 
four felony charges stemming from two sexual encounters she had with the 
teen-ager in April and May. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a 
minor, one count of sexual penetration with a foreign object and one count of 
showing explicit photos to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other criminal counts against her will be dismissed at sentencing Oct. 17, 
Connors said. Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. has agreed to place 
Arden on probation as long as no additional victims come forward prior to 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden was arrested at the E-Z 8 Motel in Newbury Park on July 27 after the 
14-year-old boy told police about his two sexual encounters with Arden. Arden 
hired the boy through a youth-employment center to help her move from a rented 
room on White Oak Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 At a preliminary hearing last month, the victim testified that he agreed to 
have sex with Arden in April because he was curious. In May, however, he said 
she forced him to have sex with her by threatening to report their previous 
sexual encounter to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy also testified that Arden showed him images on a computer screen and 
in magazines of nude women, including herself. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: D.A. LOSES BID TO GET LIBEL SUIT DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury on Monday lost his bid to have 
a libel suit dismissed when a state judge ruled in favor of a Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputy that the prosecutor publicly criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed in March by Deputy Gary Spencer who shot and killed 
Malibu millionaire Donald P. Scott during a drug raid on his property. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury later issued a 64-page report that cleared Spencer of the shooting, 
but said he may have lied to get a search warrant for Scott's 200-acre 
property. No drugs were found on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury also referred to Spencer as "a good officer . . . who lost his moral 
compass," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 While refusing to throw out the case, Kern County Superior Court Judge Stephen 
P. Gildner rejected five of Spencer's claims in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gildner ruled that Spencer could not sue Bradbury for abuse of process under 
state law, or for conspiring to violate his federal civil rights. The judge 
also threw out three other claims, but will allow Spencer to refile those 
claims in an amended lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen M. Reiser, the attorney representing Bradbury, said the district attorney 
may now file a writ of mandamus with a state appeals court seeking to throw out 
the rest of the claims in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to suing Bradbury for defamation, Spencer named four of the 
district attorney's staff members in the lawsuit alleging libel, slander, 
infliction of emotional distress and violating his civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles County, but both sides agreed to move it 
to Kern County to avoid claims of conflicts of interest. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MAN ARRESTED AFTER STRING OF 
BREAK-INS 
</P>

<P>
 A suspected burglar who authorities said had a tough time breaking into the 
Thousand Oaks Teen Center -- and apparently three area churches as well -- was 
arrested early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't too sophisticated," Sheriff's Sgt. Harold Humphries said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick E. Bourassa, 24, a former Westlake resident and now a transient, was 
arrested after running from a sheriff's deputy at about 3 a.m. Monday near the 
Thousand Oaks Teen Center on Janss Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was trying to break in when the alarm sounded, Sgt. Ken Bailey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators discovered credit cards, car keys and food vouchers on Bourassa 
that they linked to a burglary earlier Monday at St. Patrick's Episcopal Church 
on Church Road in Thousand Oaks, Humphries said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 24 hours earlier, a thief had fled when a security alarm went off at St. 
Julie Billiart Church on Borchard Road in Newbury Park, office manager Joe 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The same night, a thief had broken into the preschool at King of Glory 
Lutheran Church at 2500 Borchard Road in Newbury Park after failing to get into 
the church itself, Sgt. Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tried to jimmy the door to the church, but was unsuccessful," the Rev. 
Kenneth Eggers said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the thief, using a sledge hammer and a hoe stolen from a storage shed, 
smashed through a restroom wall and attempted to enter other rooms. But he 
reached a wall that was too thick. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave up, Eggers said, and went to St. Julie Billiart across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Several doors at the churches were damaged, Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a pretty desperate person who would break into a church," Eggers 
said. "Some of our people think it's about the lowest thing you can do." GREG

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY APPROVES LOAN TO CULTURAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center got a financial kick-start Monday in the 
form of a $138,500 loan from the city of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council unanimously approved the start-up loan to the 
Cultural Arts Center Foundation, which is transforming the Old Methodist Church 
into a 290-seat theater with an art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation plans to spend $73,000 of the money on programming and 
operations by next June, $30,500 on fund-raising efforts and $35,000 on the 
grand-opening slated for next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican activist Stephen R. Frank protested the loan. Instead, he told the 
council, the appropriation is nothing but "a taxpayer grant to the Cultural 
Arts Center" that is not even secured by a guarantor or threat of penalty for 
non-payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Mikels dismissed Frank's criticism as "a personal vendetta" 
against the arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to start somewhere," Mikels said, "and it takes a professional to 
get the fund-raising organized and to teach them (the center's organizers) how 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, construction workers are gutting and refitting the vacant church at 
3050 Los Angeles Ave. into a theater complete with a stage and room for 
backdrops and lights, at a cost of $2.55 million. MACK REED

<P>
 Representatives from the Sierra Club and city of Thousand Oaks on Monday 
decided they would be unable to settle a lawsuit over the Dos Vientos 
development out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have discovered that we definitely disagree," Sierra Club representative 
Cassandra Auerbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club has sued the city over the 2,350-home development on Dos 
Vientos Ranch.  
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists say the project would jeopardize the health and safety of 
Newbury Park residents by loading the area with traffic, air pollution and 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials have said they believe that most ill effects can be 
mitigated and add that their hands are tied by a development agreement 
guaranteeing 2,350 homes on the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the settlement conference failed to head off a trial, the city will 
concentrate on preparing the history of the Dos Vientos project as a first step 
in readying for a trial, City Atty. Mark Sellers said. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Short of money to buy lumber and other supplies, the group raising funds to 
build a community playground at Blanche Reynolds School in midtown Ventura has 
postponed its construction date from November until early March. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers for the planned Rainbow Bridge Community Playground, which will be 
built at the school but open to the public, said they have raised more than 
$40,000 in cash and materials but need $60,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
 The postponement will give organizers more time to hold fund-raisers and apply 
for corporate grants, Blanche Reynolds teacher Lisa Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just gives us a little more time," Hall said. "Now we feel like a burden 
has been lifted off our shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, a corps of 1,500 parents, teachers and other volunteers will 
build the playground by hand over five days. 
</P>
<P>
 To volunteer or to donate money or supplies, call Hall at 641-5409. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; PROPOSAL DEALS WITH ADULT PUBLICATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 In order to prevent children from being exposed to sexually explicit 
publications in convenience stores, the Camarillo Planning Commission tonight 
will consider modifying the city's zoning code to require shopkeepers to place 
covers over magazine racks holding the publications. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment to the city code, which if approved by the commission must still 
be adopted by the City Council, would not affect adult businesses in the city, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's appropriate," said Planning Commissioner William Liebmann. "We 
are talking about places where adult materials are not their primary business. 
These are places where kids go for sodas and ice cream." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting City Manager Larry Davis said the "blinder" zoning code amendment was 
in response to resident petitions given to the City Council earlier this year. 
He said city staff members agreed with the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree that these kinds of materials do not belong in front of minors," 
Davis said. "We support this change." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will consider the amendment at its meeting at 7:30 p.m. at City 
Hall, 601 Carmen Drive. J.E. MITCHELL

 Port Hueneme City Council will hold a public hearing Wednesday night on a 
proposed utility tax to raise the $500,000 a year the city needs to maintain 
its 19-officer Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 To be implemented by the end of the year, the utility tax would be tacked onto 
bills for water, electricity, gas and cable television. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to approve an initial version of the utility tax in July 
after a property tax measure fell just shy of the two-thirds majority needed 
for approval in the June 7 election. CHRISTINA LIMA

<P>
 In an effort to rid the city of unkempt yards, the Camarillo Planning 
Commission tonight will consider amending the city's zoning ordinance to 
require homeowners to landscape their front and side yards and install 
irrigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the amendment would give homeowners a year to install the 
landscaping and irrigation systems or face fines. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment must also be approved by the City Council before it can take 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a major problem, but we don't want what problems we do have to 
get out of hand," said acting City Manager Larry Davis. "We see this as a 
proactive approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commission Chairman Les Meredith refused to comment on the issue 
until after hearing a staff presentation. Other commission members also 
declined to comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will consider the issue at its 7:30 p.m. meeting today at City 
Hall, 601 Carmen Drive. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT FOR TOURISM CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Volunteers are being sought to greet visitors who stop by the Oxnard tourism 
bureau's new office at the Oxnard Factory Outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Lavender, executive director of the tourism bureau, said she is looking 
for as many as 60 people to work in the center providing information to those 
who stop in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a responsible position," Lavender said. "And it gives the volunteers a 
chance to meet the public and be helpful in a number of different situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Lavender said the volunteers would work about four hours at a time at the 
factory outlet office, which she said attracted more than 5,000 people in June, 
the month it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pretty much act as an ambassador to Oxnard by giving people the 
information they are requesting about the area, where to shop or where to stay 
while they're visiting," she said of the volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Without an increase in the number of volunteers at the tourism center, the 
center may have to cut its hours of operation, Lavender said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently the office is open from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. seven days a week. For 
more information or to volunteer, call 385-7545. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 A Port Hueneme man was in jail Monday after being arrested on suspicion of 
abusing his 17-year-old girlfriend, stealing a car and possessing a pipe bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme police arrested Richard A. Frenes, 25, Sunday afternoon while he 
was moving out of his apartment in the 100 block of Ann Avenue, according to 
Detective Christopher T. Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said Frenes' girlfriend told police that Frenes had injured her and 
that he was keeping a stolen car in the garage of their apartment. When police 
searched the trunk of the car, a red 1985 Chevrolet Camaro, they found a bomb 
in a shoe box, Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said Frenes claimed he was keeping the bomb for a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Bob Garcia of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department bomb team said 
the seven-inch plastic-pipe bomb was removed from the scene and dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment building was evacuated for about three hours Sunday while police 
removed the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Frenes, who is scheduled to be arraigned today, was in jail Monday evening in 
lieu of $7,500 bail. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; APARTMENT SITE FIRE UNDER INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cause of a blaze that destroyed part of an apartment complex under 
construction in Ventura is being classified as suspicious while investigators 
continue to hunt for a motive and possible arson suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out at 12:11 a.m. Sunday in the 1100 block of Cypress Point 
Lane where a 12-unit complex for senior citizens, called Cypress Meadows, was 
being built. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Investigator Glenn True said the fire began on the second floor of the 
complex and spread quickly through the structure, which did not yet have 
interior walls. Damage was estimated at $100,000 to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely suspicious for something like that to happen at that time of 
morning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials have ruled out natural causes, but said they have not yet found 
any telltale signs of arson, such as the use of flammable liquids. True said 
investigators will have to develop more information before the fire is ruled 
arson. 
</P>
<P>
 A few workmen dropped off materials at the construction site Saturday, but no 
work was performed. A six-foot, chain-link fence surrounds the site, and a 
foreman with Towbes Construction, the Santa Barbara company building the 
complex, said it appeared that the fence had been cut, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides examining the charred remains of the complex, investigators are trying 
to locate two people seen leaving the scene of the fire just after it began. 
One person drove away in a vehicle and the other was seen walking north on 
Cypress Point Lane, True said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps they were leaving for work at that time, or they might have been our 
bad guys," True said. JULIE FIELDS

PLAN TO FORCE DEVELOPERS TO PAY FOR TREE PLANTING, MAINTENANCE DEBATED; 
LANDSCAPING: BACKERS SAY THE PROPOSAL IS NEEDED TO COVER HIGH COSTS OF UPKEEP. 
THOUSAND OAKS BUILDERS OPPOSE THE ADDITIONAL FEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to build up their urban forest, Thousand Oaks council members tonight 
will consider requiring developers to plant trees along city streets -- and 
then pay to trim, water and nurture them. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, designed to keep city streets shaded and graceful, is contained 
in a new document known as the Forestry Element to the General Plan. The thick 
report also calls for private donations to a so-called tree trust or tree 
endowment fund, to cover the growing costs of maintaining city landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "The forestry master plan is an effort to give a value to our community forest 
so it can be enhanced and protected," Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski explained. 
"After all, this is Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 But some developers think the pro-bark plan carries too much bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees on city sidewalks should be the city's responsibility, they argue. 
Developers building on vacant lots already pay $129 per parcel in tax each year 
to maintain landscaping, and most are opposed to shouldering additional costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfair," developer George Connor said. "I see us being responsible for 
the plantings on our property. But we had to plant some oak trees on the 
sidewalk, and those trees got all bent over. They need to be straightened with 
a professional job. It's the city's responsibility, not the developer's to pick 
them up." 
</P>
<P>
 Connor, who owns several shopping centers along Thousand Oaks Boulevard, 
expressed another concern as well: Too many trees could block small shops and 
make it tough for retailers to draw customers. 
</P>
<P>
 He especially worries about a provision urging enforcement of a recent city 
law requiring that at least 50% of a parking lot be shaded by trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our tenants have been kicking and screaming about it," said 
architect Francisco Behr, who is designing a project for the Seventh-day 
Adventist Church in Newbury Park. "They're very concerned about visibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Shading half of that project's 3,000 parking stalls will cost more than $1 
million, Behr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Forestry Element also covers other ground, establishing dozens of basic 
policies about how Thousand Oaks should treat its trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for: 
</P>
<P>
 * Promoting neighborhood forestry plans. Using tree plantings to create 
community identity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Requiring permits for all tree pruning on public land and commercial and 
industrial properties. 
</P>
<P>
 * Phasing out grassy medians and replacing them with mulch and 
drought-tolerant plantings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encouraging the use of native plants and experimental species. 
</P>
<P>
 When a draft of the Forestry Element was circulated last year, the document 
contained several proposals that council members deemed too Draconian -- 
including a citywide tax to maintain trees. The latest draft omits that 
proposal and scratches a plan to count every tree in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwomen Zukowski and Elois Zeanah said they would like to revive the 
inventory idea, calling it vital to create a record of the city's urban forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "What good is a master plan, and how can the city enforce it, if there is no 
inventory?" Zeanah asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Works Director Donald Nelson said he does not know the cost of counting 
every tree in the city. But he wants to build a computer record of every tree 
on city property to keep tabs on maintenance procedures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that computer count gets going, many city officials expect it to keep 
growing, as more trees sprout in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Planting a tree is indicative of your belief in the future," Councilwoman 
Judy Lazar said. "I can't say enough in favor of trees."

CITY MANAGER PROPOSES SEEKING COMMUNITY INPUT ON BUDGET; THOUSAND OAKS: A TASK 
FORCE, COMPOSED OF TWO DOZEN LOCAL ACTIVISTS, WOULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE 
CITY COUNCIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how Thousand Oaks leaders craft the city's $72-million budget, 
constituents complain: Why cut back on street sweeping? Why not hire more 
police? Why not lower golf course fees? 
</P>
<P>
 To give citizens a crack at airing those concerns early, before the 
phone-book-size spending plan is printed, City Manager Grant Brimhall has 
proposed establishing a Community Budget Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen local activists -- perhaps one representative from every city 
commission -- would huddle with council members and bureaucrats to debate the 
budget in televised sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens would thus, for the first time, have the chance to give input before 
the city comes up with a detailed spending plan. If citizens wanted cleaner 
streets, they might have to settle for fewer recycling programs. If they wanted 
more police patrols, they might have to cut back on drug-education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations would then be forwarded to the City Council for 
consideration during a public hearing. And several council members said they 
would welcome the input -- and the chance to show citizens how they arrive at 
tough decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to say, 'Expand library hours,' and another to say, 'Here's 
where you should cut services to pay for that (expansion),' " Councilwoman Judy 
Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with advising the council on spending priorities, the committee could 
help the city draft an understandable budget, officials said. Citizens and 
council members alike have complained that the budget, packed with columns of 
figures, is difficult to digest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need clear graph displays and a consistent charting of where the money 
goes from year to year," Zukowski said. "There needs to be much more citizen 
oversight of the city's budget process." 
</P>
<P>
 While she agrees with the principle of citizen participation, Councilwoman 
Elois Zeanah suggested a different approach to revamping the city's budget 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of inviting arts commissioners and sports coaches to sit on a budget 
task force, she proposed asking professional accountants, auditors and 
financial managers to review the city's spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has won state and national awards for excellent financial 
statements, the accountants who conducted the most recent audit found some 
inconsistent reporting practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be a lot of confusion and a lot of flux," Zeanah said. "This 
is dangerous. This is not the way to run a city." A professional oversight 
committee, Zeanah added, would provide "the safeguards we take for granted are 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Frank Schillo, himself a financial planner, countered that the 
city's regular audit should give residents confidence in municipal finances. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he could support a well-trained task force to advise council members 
on spending priorities, Schillo said, but not a group of accountants meddling 
in the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an audit every year, for God's sake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members received Brimhall's recommendation about the community task 
force with this week's agenda packet. But they will not formally consider the 
report until their Oct. 4 meeting. At that time, they will also tinker with the 
1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Brimhall has recommended boosting the sheriff's budget $200,000, which would 
cover the cost of dispatching another staffed patrol car 56 hours a week. The 
funding could come from rejiggering the financing of the East Valley Sheriff's 
Station, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In reviewing the budget, Brimhall also explored the possibility of opening the 
Thousand Oaks Library on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the library open on Fridays, the city would have to cut morning and 
evening hours throughout the week, Brimhall concluded. So he and library 
Director Marvin Smith have recommended sticking with the current hours of 10 
a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, and 1 to 5 
p.m. Sunday.

SIMI SUPPORTS LOW-COST CONDOS WITH $700,000 LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Looking to increase its stock of affordable housing, the Simi Valley City 
Council on Monday agreed to lend $700,000 to a Los Angeles County builder for a 
housing tract that will include 31 low-cost condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 0 to lend the developer a portion of a federal grant 
the city received to help replace buildings lost during the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin Industries plans to build the condos, selling for about $125,000, for 
low-income buyers as part of a complex of 122 condos and 398 houses at the 
corner of Los Angeles Avenue and Madera Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to relay the $700,000 in Community Development Block Grant 
money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to Griffin 
Industries in October, as soon as the city planners complete an environmental 
assessment on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The project hit a snag last spring, when Griffin Vice President Richard Niec 
told city officials he could not afford to postpone construction for the 
environmental study.  
</P>
<P>
 But HUD refused to commit earthquake money to the project without it and Niec 
eventually agreed to give the city time to do the study so the project could 
move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement approved Monday by the City Council requires Griffin to start 
building within two years. Griffin then must repay the loan, which is secured 
by a 4.39-acre parcel of land in Thousand Oaks owned by Paul and Gloria Griffin 
-- at an annual 6% interest rate by September, 1999.

CITY THAT WANTS TO BE SECOND TO NONE STRIVES TO LOWER CRIME RATE; THOUSAND 
OAKS: IT'S THE NEXT-SAFEST LARGE U.S. CITY, BUT MERCHANTS AND POLICE AREN'T 
SATISFIED. THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING A SLEW OF NEW PROGRAMS.

<P>
 Second safest is not safe enough for feed store owner Jeff Alexander -- or for 
many other Thousand Oaks residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander and a group of other merchants and volunteers are working with 
police and city officials to hammer together a suite of community-based 
crime-fighting programs that they hope will stop crime altogether and make 
their city the safest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Police records show that the fast-growing business strip along Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard had 41 armed robberies between January and August this year, and a 
similar rate in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 That is far too many, said Alexander, who runs T.O. Corral on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, there should be zero tolerance for crime in this 
community," Alexander said. "What I want to do is eliminate the excuses and get 
rid of the crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander and others have been pushing for the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department to open a storefront police station on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials are studying crime patterns in the city's business core 
along Thousand Oaks Boulevard to pick a likely site for such a station, and may 
accept Alexander's offer of a rent-free office, said Lt. Mike Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The storefront police station is but one of a slew of programs under 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 With grass-roots pressure and City Council support, the Sheriff's Department 
has been working out these other community-based policing plans: 
</P>
<P>
 * A citizens patrol. With a core group of about 14 volunteers ready for 
training, the Volunteers in Policing program could be outfitted with 
city-funded walkie-talkies, uniforms and a couple of cars, and cruising the 
street by next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The patrol members also would staff the storefront to take complaints, hand 
out information and relay crime reports to the sheriff's far-flung East Valley 
headquarters on the northern fringes of Thousand Oaks, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bicycle patrols. Seeing the success of pedal-powered police in Simi Valley 
and other communities, deputies on the sheriff's Special Enforcement Detail are 
refitting seven mountain bikes that were unclaimed stolen property, and 
ordering gear and training to start their own patrol. The patrol should be 
ready in a month or less, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merchants' mobile crime watch. About 25 Thousand Oaks business owners are 
already cruising Thousand Oaks, looking for trouble to report to police. Last 
week, they finished training with the Sheriff's Department, slapped magnetic 
signs on their car doors and began carrying cellular phones so they can call in 
tips on suspicious activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks had the second-lowest crime rate last year of any city in the 
United States with a population over 100,000, but it still could be safer, said 
Sgt. Bruce Hansen, the sheriff's crime prevention officer for Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to drop into the top 10," Hansen said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to keep it as safe as we can, and really the way to do that -- 
especially with shrinking public budgets -- is to involve the community," he 
said. "And the community seems to be responding very well. There's people out 
there who don't mind being involved with the Police Department and donating 
some of their time." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander is one. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owner Dennis Carlson is another. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the town grows, all kinds of opportunities grow, and (crime) is one we'd 
like to keep to a minimum," said Carlson, owner of Carlson Building Materials 
on Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson also offered office space to the Sheriff's Department for a storefront 
police station, which he said would help put a police presence closer to the 
center of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different emphasis between a station that's halfway to Simi and one 
that's here in the downtown area," he said. "This is where the people are, good 
and bad. There's folks here, and that's where you've got to have your Police 
Department and their representatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks is devoted to crime prevention, said Sgt. Hansen, pointing to 
the third sheriff's Citizens Academy -- a 12-week mini-course in police work -- 
that starts Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiting list for the next 25-member class has nearly 100 names, Hansen 
said.

JIM MURRAY: WHO'D HAVE DREAMED IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM MURRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 I feel cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen, when you were a kid, did you ever dream of the things you'd do when 
you got older? Plan what you'd do with success? 
</P>
<P>
 So did I.  
</P>
<P>
 For instance, when I was a boy, times were hard. The Depression was on. You 
had to cut corners, make do. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing we had to do was wear these god-awful sneakers, ersatz shoes made 
out of canvas and rubber. You had to wear them till the canvas tore, the rubber 
split and you couldn't bear to sleep in the same room with them after a long 
hot summer's day. 
</P>
<P>
 I said to myself, "When I grow up and get work, I'll never wear another pair 
of sneakers again as long as I live." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, I grew up and got older and more prosperous. And everybody in the world, 
all my colleagues and friends, took to wearing these damn athletic shoes that, 
so far as I'm concerned, are just sneakers with a superiority complex.  
</P>
<P>
 I also said when I got money in the bank, you'd never get me to wear a pair of 
overalls or denim pants that would tear at the knee ever again.  
</P>
<P>
 So, I grew up and all of the "in" people, rich movie producers, actors and 
actresses and agents, are wearing jeans torn at the knee to go with their 
sneakers and sweat shirts. Ugh! Do you know how I hated sweat shirts growing 
up? 
</P>
<P>
 I could cry. Then, I dreamed of wearing a tuxedo, tails, maybe. At the very 
least, I pictured three-piece suits and neckties. With roses or palm trees on 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, I grew up and went to fancy restaurants and nobody was even wearing a 
suit jacket, never mind a tie. They had bush jackets thrown over their shoulder 
as if they had just spent the day hunting lions. As for tuxedos, the only guys 
in restaurants wearing tuxedos were head waiters. 
</P>
<P>
 Our role models were guys like Ted Williams, who said he wouldn't wear a tie 
to meet a king. I wanted to graduate into starched collars and these guys wore 
no collars. T-shirts, maybe. To me, T-shirts were something you wore under real 
shirts. When you could afford real shirts.  
</P>
<P>
 I wanted bench-made shoes from England when I made my poke. Then I grew up and 
everybody was wearing cowboy boots. Guys who had never seen a cow.  
</P>
<P>
 When I thought of a car, I used to picture this neat Packard, maybe with jump 
seats and wood paneling. Or perhaps, a Pierce-Arrow. I loved Pierce-Arrows.  
</P>
<P>
 Then I grew up -- and everybody was riding around in a Jeep Cherokee or a 
Range Rover or some damn pickup truck. Rich guys drove those bloody things. I 
couldn't believe it. In my day, they'd be ashamed to be seen in the front seat 
of one. We left trucks to truck drivers. What self-respecting woman would ride 
around in the cab of a truck?  
</P>
<P>
 I watched the slow, steady decline of the amenities. I hankered to get the 
peasant out of me but society wanted to get the peasant back in. Everybody 
wanted to look like a peasant. Me, I wanted to look like J. Pierpont Morgan. My 
favorite movie growing up was "Diamond Jim Brady," not "The Grapes of Wrath," 
or "Cool Hand Luke." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of movies, I used to save up to go to these great big extravagant 
musicals, Busby Berkeley specials with leggy chorines and tenors in white tie 
and tails. On stage, I wanted to see the Ziegfeld Follies. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I grew up and the movies were all about people living in tenements, in 
poverty or hard times. A Broadway musical was a bunch of people dressed up as 
cats, if you can believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 I dreamed of Westerns in which the guy in the white hat rode in on a white 
horse and saved the town from the outlaws. Then I grew up and the outlaws were 
the heroes, the guys in the white hats were klutzes made fools of by Butch 
Cassidy or the Sundance Kid or somebody.  
</P>
<P>
 Cheated again.  
</P>
<P>
 But I had a saver. I still had sports. Ah, I figured, some day I would have 
enough to go see all those things I dreamed about listening to radio.  
</P>
<P>
 The Army-Navy game was high on my priorities. I loved the idea of the 
Army-Navy game. All those marching cadets, midshipmen, the baritone growl of 
the rooting sections, the uniforms, the military brass. And two of the best 
teams in the country.  
</P>
<P>
 And then, I grew up. And only the other day, I picked up the paper to see 
where Navy got beat by San Diego State -- San Diego State! -- 56-14. And Army 
got beat by Duke, 43-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, what kind of image is that for our armed services? Who wants to go to 
that Army-Navy game? Two admirals and General Schwarzkopf. You want to see 
top-rate football, you have to go see Florida play Florida State, wherever that 
is and whoever they are. 
</P>
<P>
 I dreamed of seeing the Army-Notre Dame game. But the Humane Society won't let 
them play anymore. And whatever happened to the Yale-Harvard game? And raccoon 
coats? Man, I wanted a raccoon coat and Boola-Boola! Does anybody go to 
Yale-Harvard anymore? They're not even in the NCAA's top division in football 
anymore. And remember Harvard came to the Rose Bowl in its day. 
</P>
<P>
 But all was not lost. I still had baseball! Good old baseball! "Take me out to 
the ballgame . . . I don't care if I never get back!" Right?  
</P>
<P>
 I dreamed of being able to afford box seats at the World Series. See great 
pitching, great hitting, great history. Root, root, root for the home team. 
Maybe catch a foul ball and go get the Mick to autograph it, eh?  
</P>
<P>
 Not! It's all yesterday's roses. The world has tricked me. All the things I 
dreamed of in my youth have vanished in my old age. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, no World Series? No guys calling the shot? No Willie Mays catching 
home runs over his shoulder 450 feet from home plate? No Gashouse Gang? No 
pitchers named Dizzy? No Murderers' Row, Big Red Machines? No Wild Thing? What 
do we talk about all winter? What kind of a crummy world is this?  
</P>
<P>
 I think you can have the 21st Century. Just be sure your sneakers match.

HOLLAND QUITS COACHING JOB AT FULLERTON; BASKETBALL: IN SURPRISE MOVE, HE 
LEAVES TO TAKE OVER UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brad Holland, whose two-season basketball coaching tenure at Cal State 
Fullerton went from high hopes to growing uncertainty, has resigned to become 
the coach at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity my family and I are extremely excited about," Holland 
said Monday. "The timing wasn't the best for either school, and I wish it were 
better. But I had to base the decision on other things: the location, the level 
playing field of the conference, and it's a beautiful area to raise kids." 
</P>
<P>
 John Easterbrook, the new Cal State Fullerton athletic director, was in his 
office briefly Monday and learned of Holland's resignation on the eve of his 
first official day on the job. Easterbrook said Monday night he will study the 
situation today and discuss it with university officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be my first order of business," Easterbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Preseason practice is scheduled to begin Oct. 15. One of Holland's assistants, 
Bob Hawking, is a possible choice to be named interim coach. Hawking is a 
former high school coach at Simi Valley and an assistant at Pepperdine. Holland 
said he supports Hawking for the permanent position. One player, Chris Dade, 
said he and several of his teammates also think Hawking should get strong 
consideration as Holland's successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland, who was an assistant for four years at his alma mater under UCLA 
Coach Jim Harrick, replaces Hank Egan. Egan resigned Aug. 31 to take an 
assistant position with the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fullerton was caught way off-guard, but when a tough decision comes along, 
regardless of the timing, you've got to make them," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland informed his Fullerton players of the decision Monday morning, then 
went to the University of San Diego for the official announcement. "The players 
were startled and caught off-guard," Holland said. "I told them that I 
understand that the timing is difficult. I think a lot of them felt 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland said telling his Fullerton players was "the toughest part." He added: 
"I signed them up to be with us, but there were no guarantees I would be there 
for four years . . . There are no guarantees in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland will take over a team that plays in the West Coast Conference along 
with Pepperdine, San Francisco, St. Mary's, Gonzaga, Portland, Santa Clara and 
Loyola Marymount. "I've always admired the West Coast Conference," Holland said 
at the press conference. "It has both quality coaches and quality 
student-athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland said the conference was part of the attraction. "Budgets and 
facilities are similar, and these are all private universities with similar 
enrollments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland's contact at Fullerton went through the 1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
 He originally signed a three-year contract with a one-year rollover clause. 
That contract was extended for one year under that clause after his first 
season. The Titans finished 15-12, which was Fullerton's first winning record 
in four years. The Titans were 10-8 in the Big West, finishing fifth, and along 
the way defeated every team in the conference except New Mexico. The Titans 
ended the regular season with a one-point victory over Nevada Las Vegas. After 
that season, Nevada sought permission to talk to Holland about its coaching 
vacancy, which eventually went to Pat Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 The next season, however, turned sour before it began. Starting guard Don 
Leary was ruled ineligible academically, and two other players, guard Chris 
Dade and forward DeVaughn Wright, were sidelined for the season with injuries 
before the first game. Senior forward Todd Satalowich played two minutes in the 
opener, and was lost the remainder of the season because of recurring back 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans fell to 8-19, the worst record at the school since the 1980-81 team 
went 4-23. But Fullerton still managed some rousing victories, including 
winning at UNLV, 84-75, in February and at Nevada and UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Shumard, who resigned as Titan athletic director in May, confirmed Monday 
that he again had sought a one-year extension for Holland under the rollover 
clause last spring, but his request was denied by the university 
administration. Shumard said the reason given was that the team's academic 
performance had not been strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The university's failure to extend Holland's contact was one of the factors in 
Shumard's decision to resign. He later accepted a job as an assistant athletic 
director at his alma mater, Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland's program recently had its second eligibility setback in two seasons 
when Darren Little, a 6-7 forward who started 20 games last season, was ruled 
ineligible. He was the team's third-leading scorer with an average of 11.7 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans also lost their top young prospect when 6-7 forward Josh King 
decided last spring to transfer to Rhode Island. He averaged 6.7 points as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland also had some recruiting disappointments this spring and summer. Guard 
Dion Holton of Long Beach Poly High committed to Fullerton, then decided to 
sign with Portland. His high school coach, Ron Palmer, said Holton switched 
when he heard that Holland was mentioned as a possibility for the Pepperdine 
job, which was vacant at the time. Fullerton also missed on coveted community 
college player, 6-8 Brian Yankelvitz of Garden City (Kan.) College. He signed 
with Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans wound up signing four players, three of them from community 
colleges, and Holland said he was optimistic about them. "I felt the 
opportunity definitely was there to have a much better season than a year ago," 
Holland said. "I was quite excited about the personality of the team that was 
starting to take shape." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, none of Holland's assistants at Fullerton will move with him to 
San Diego. The current San Diego assistants remain under contract there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will continue to be business as usual for me," said assistant coach George 
Tuttle. "We'll continue to work to keep the kids focused and looking to the new 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton players indicated they were more surprised by the timing of the 
change than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of surprised," senior forward Fred Amos said. "I heard that he was 
interested in the Pepperdine job, but when he didn't get that job, I expected 
him to be around. If it's a better situation for him, though, I wish him well. 
It's just so close to the season. That's what makes it surprising." 
</P>
<P>
 Dade said he also was disappointed by Holland's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel let down as much as anything," Dade said. "One of the reasons I came 
to Fullerton was because of Brad Holland. We had a team meeting and several of 
us would like to see Coach Hawking get the job. We hope to be able to talk to 
the new athletic director about it soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland said he thinks promoting Hawking would be in the best interest of the 
program. "He's put his heart and soul into the program, and he's been involved 
in the recruiting of most of the players," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking was not available for comment.

MILLER IS DOWN, BUT NOT YET OUT; RAMS: OFT-INJURED QUARTERBACK SAYS HE'S 
DAY-TO-DAY BECAUSE OF SORE SHOULDER. CHANDLER WILL START AGAINST CHIEFS IF 
MILLER CAN'T PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' latest quarterback situation was painfully clear Monday afternoon 
when Chris Miller and Chris Chandler walked side by side on their way to a team 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, the incumbent starter, had his right throwing arm bent at his side and 
rubbed his sore right shoulder with his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, the backup, walked pain-free. 
</P>
<P>
 So who will the Rams start on Sunday against a Kansas City pass rush that 
features Derrick Thomas and Neil Smith? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams remain mum, but Chandler, acquired in the off-season as an insurance 
policy for the often-injured Miller, said he's preparing himself as if he is 
the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always do anyway," he said. "But considering he (Miller) is all banged up, 
it adds a little more importance." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said Monday: "There's no way I can throw today or tomorrow, but maybe 
in a couple days. Right now, it's just day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've definitely felt better, but I'm going in and getting treatment and doing 
the things I need to do to get ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox stuck with his tradition of not making personnel 
decisions on Mondays. But Knox said Chandler would get the start Sunday if 
Miller isn't healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll wait and see what develops," Knox said. "If Miller isn't ready to go, 
Chandler will. We'll know more on Miller's situation in a couple days." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has come back from two knee surgeries in the last two seasons, missed 
the exhibition opener with a sore abdomen and received three pain-killing 
injections in his rib cage for the Atlanta game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he received an injection for a nerve he pinched in his right shoulder 
when he was sacked by San Francisco's Dana Stubblefield in the second quarter 
of the 49ers' 34-19 victory at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 During his seven seasons in Atlanta, Miller was often criticized for his lack 
of durability. Does Knox have similar concerns now, after the team invested a 
three-year, $9-million contract in Miller? 
</P>
<P>
 "The injuries he had before were to his knees," Knox said. "It's unfortunate 
that he has the rib cartilage and now the pinched nerve. But those things 
happen. That's the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern we had about him when we brought him here was about his knees. 
But that was cleared up. There are a lot of guys who get banged up around the 
league. Look at how many quarterbacks were out last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Through three games, Miller has the lowest completion percentage in the league 
(24 of 55 for 43.6%) and ranks 26th in the league in passing efficiency. He has 
thrown two touchdown passes, has had four passes intercepted and hasn't brought 
any consistency to a Ram offense that ranks 24th in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have a capable backup in Chandler and a promising young passer in 
third-stringer Tommy Maddox, a former UCLA standout the Rams acquired last 
month in a trade with the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox, inactive for the first three games, would move to the No. 2 spot if 
Miller goes out. Maddox has been running the scout squad in practice while 
learning the Rams' offense, but hasn't worked with the top offensive units. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows the offense pretty well," Knox said. "He just needs to get some 
repetitions in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox coveted Chandler in the off-season, pursuing him for a while as a 
possible starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, Chandler visited Rams Park the same day the team signed Miller. 
The Rams signed Chandler to a one-year, $600,000 deal a few weeks later and 
made him the backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler lost battles for starting jobs with Vinny Testaverde at Tampa Bay and 
with Steve Beuerlein at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 He has started 39 games in a seven-year NFL career with Indianapolis, Tampa 
Bay and most recently, Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 He started 13 games as a rookie in Indianapolis in 1988, completing 55.4% of 
his passes with eight touchdowns and 12 interceptions. In 1992, he started 13 
games with Arizona before losing his starting job to Beuerlein last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last regular-season start, Arizona's 20-15 loss at Dallas on Nov. 14, 
1993, Chandler completed 27 of 46 passes for 214 yards with one touchdown and 
one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler has come off the bench the past two games in relief of Miller, 
completing 18 of 32 passes (56.3%) for one touchdown and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his work has been in the Rams' shotgun formation with four wide 
receivers, when they were trailing late in games against Atlanta and San 
Francisco.

MIKE PENNER: MCKNIGHT OFFERS A FEW OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Another basketball coach bails out of Cal State Fullerton, and the alum on the 
other end of the phone says it's high time the school changed its image as 
Ripcord U. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to get a coach in there who sincerely wants to build the 
program there and have the school make a real commitment to him," the alum 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of coach, he says, who doesn't "go into that job only to use it as a 
stepping stone to a better job some place else." 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of coach who is going to "recruit some kids -- maybe not the big, big 
time players, but some high school players who are going to be there four years 
and give you a foundation, not just JC kids so you can quick-fix it and get out 
of town." 
</P>
<P>
 The alum knows such a coach. Quite well, as a matter of fact. Spends every 
hour of every day with him, truth be known. 
</P>
<P>
 The alum's name is Gary McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight is just talking here, rolling out a few opinions, lobbying for 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's not carping at Brad Holland, the man who beat out McKnight for the 
Fullerton job in 1992 and began banging on doors almost immediately -- the 
University of Nevada's, Pepperdine's, the University of San Diego's, anywhere 
that offered a way out. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight says he "likes Brad Holland" and thinks Holland "got into a great 
situation" by high-tailing it down to USD on Monday. "I think he's got a team 
he can compete with there." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, McKnight is wary about these Big West vacancies by now. Big 
teases, he calls them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel some times I'm being used," says the Jerry Tarkanian of Orange County 
prep basketball, the coach and curator of the Mater Dei High School dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, 'Give the (top) high school coach in the area an interview and keep 
him happy so he won't stop sending us players. Keep the Mater Deis and the Long 
Beach Polys happy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But McKnight happens to be a Fullerton graduate, Class of '76, and makes a 
point of noting that he actually "enjoyed Fullerton." (This could land McKnight 
on an upcoming "Geraldo.") He has watched George McQuarn, John Sneed and now 
Holland come and go, and cares enough about the alma mater to chart a Proper 
Course for the next coach, whoever that might be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is gonna walk in and turn it overnight," McKnight says. "Right now, 
Fullerton's a very, very difficult situation. They lost a lot of players and 
their recruiting class is a little down. Whoever gets it is going to have an 
uphill fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "But whoever takes it should make it a priority to stay a while. He should 
say, 'I'm here for the long haul, I'm going to make this a career job,' and 
then get rewarded by the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school should say, 'Hey, we're going to commit to you for four, five 
years. This is not gonna be just a two-year program.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Holland complained to the end, premature as it was, that Fullerton lacked the 
first-rate facility it takes to recruit against the New Mexico States and the 
UNLVs -- and, now, the Long Beach States. Holland just lost a recruit, Brian 
Yankelvitz of Garden City (Kan.) Community College, after Yankelvitz stepped 
onto the Long Beach campus and caught one glimpse of the glimmering new 
Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't stress enough how important your facility is," Holland reiterated 
Monday evening. "Young men today have a very high awareness of what kind of 
home arena and locker room they have. They really look at it. It's important 
for kids." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, San Diego offers Holland an even smaller cupboard than Titan 
Gym -- the USD Sports Center, nothing more than a high school gym, seats just 
2,500 -- but there's a promise of a 1995 ground-breaking for a "5,000-seat Bren 
Center kind of facility," according to Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight, too, has experienced the grimy nooks and crannies of Titan Gym. As a 
student, he rooted for Bobby Dye's teams there. As a coach, he has won playoff 
games there in front of overflow crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 From his perspective, there's nothing wrong with the Rambling Wreck at Titan 
Tech a few 19-10 seasons couldn't cure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the worst arena around," McKnight says. "It's workable. It's not The 
Pond, but it's a nice enough facility. Loyola Marymount doesn't play in that 
great a place, but Paul (Westhead) put the right system in there, played 
up-tempo and was able to recruit there . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes some creative scheduling. Maybe you squeeze a doubleheader out of 
The Pond with a couple other teams, make it a little more attractive. And 
you've got to make the program more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come in there and say, 'We're not going to walk it up the court, we're going 
to play up-tempo, we're going to run. They may score 120, but we'll get 110.' 
Do something to get those orange boosters cranked up again." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone care to try to implement it? 
</P>
<P>
 Holland recommends his assistant, Bob Hawking, and McKnight finds no fault 
with that. "I think Bob Hawking should get it," McKnight says. "That would be a 
good choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that McKnight would allow a phone message from John Easterbrook, the new 
Fullerton AD, to die on the answering machine, mind you. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have a sincere interest, yeah, I'd be interested in seeing what the 
situation is," McKnight says. "But I've got a good job and a great situation 
right now. I could be happy here forever." 
</P>
<P>
 No Cal State Fullerton basketball coach has ever uttered such a sentence. But 
happy for more than 29 months? McKnight suspects it can be done.

RAIDERS STILL WAIT FOR DAVIS; PRO FOOTBALL: AWOL DEFENSIVE END FAILS TO MAKE 
GOOD ON VOW TO RETURN TO TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He told Raider management he was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 He told several players he was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 He even told a reporter who ran into him at the airport Saturday that he was 
coming back to the team on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday came and went at the Raider training headquarters in El Segundo and 
there was no Scott Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The defensive end has now been missing for 14 days, absent since he left camp 
Sept. 6, the day after the Raiders' season-opening loss and right after he had 
fought with teammate Greg Biekert. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider officials will only say that personal problems are causing the 
29-year-old Davis' absence. None blame the fight for Davis' walk-out. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday is traditionally reserved for reviewing game films. Today is a day off. 
So Davis could conceivably return to El Segundo Wednesday, the week's first 
full day of practice, and still be prepared for Sunday's home game against the 
San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept hearing, 'He's coming. He's coming. He's coming.' " linebacker 
Winston Moss said. "I'm going to wait until I actually see him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wants to play on Sunday, it would be nice if we see him on Wednesday. 
If he got in a couple of practices, that would be cool. He needs those 
practices to get up to speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis told a Raider official last week that he was ready to return, then 
called several teammates to explain his absence. "I don't speculate," Coach Art 
Shell said when asked if he was expecting Davis. "He hasn't talked to me about 
it, so it's still the same." 
</P>
<P>
 If and when Davis does return, it will be his second comeback with the 
Raiders. His first absence lasted two years. After starting every game in both 
the 1990 and '91 seasons, he retired to go into business. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he returned as suddenly as he had left, saying he thought he could still 
contribute to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis signed a four-year, $5.3-million contract this summer, then slowly 
played himself into shape on the second unit. He was promoted to the starting 
lineup for the Monday night opener against the San Francisco 49ers, then was 
gone less than 24 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Thin in the defensive line with the retirement of Howie Long and the release 
of Greg Townsend, the Raiders are not expected to give up on Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago in a loss to the Seattle Seahawks, when linemen Chester McGlockton 
and Aundray Bruce were ejected, and fellow lineman Jerry Ball suffered a pulled 
hamstring, the Raiders were down to four defensive linemen, including John 
Duff, a converted tight end, and Austin Robbins, a fifth-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday against the Denver Broncos, Ball played, although he still was hurt, 
and the line was effective, keeping the pressure on Denver quarterback John 
Elway in a 48-16 Raider victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback Napoleon McCallum, who suffered a season-ending leg injury in the 
opener, came around to visit his teammates and receive the game ball awarded 
him after Sunday's victory over the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum, who suffered a severed artery and a dislocated kneecap when tackled 
by San Francisco linebacker Ken Norton Jr., was on crutches Monday. When he had 
visited the Raiders a week earlier, he had been in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell spotted McCallum from his office window, then joked to reporters that 
"He's late. He's going to be fined." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has already been a strange season for the Raiders, even beyond the Davis 
affair, and it's less than a month old. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders went through the summer and the exhibition season picked by many 
to survive all the way to the Super Bowl. They did nothing to dissuade their 
believers by winning four of five exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the season opened and the Raiders were stuck in neutral, if not 
reverse, getting outscored in two losses, 82-23, before finally breaking 
through Sunday to play the way many had envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell certainly didn't script it that way but, in retrospect, says it might 
have been a good thing for this team. "Reality has to set in," he said. "You've 
got to play the game. You can't talk it. You can tell them. But sometimes, 
you've got to get burned like a kid. (You can tell them), 'Don't touch the 
fire. It will burn you.' But they don't believe it until they stick their hand 
in the fire."

AT 18, A VETERAN OF HARD ROAD; OMM'A GIVENS NEVER HAS HAD IT EASY, BUT HIS LACK 
OF PAMPERING IS EXPECTED TO MAKE HIM EVEN BETTER UCLA CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 His name is taken from the ancient Sanskrit mantra chanted during many Hindu 
meditations. It is said to represent the first sound generated by the newly 
created universe. It translates roughly as the universe and everything in it. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is omm'A Givens and even though he is only 18, he can tell you, it's 
a strange and wondrous universe. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 6 feet 11, a freshman basketball player at UCLA. But the thing that 
makes omm'A Givens interesting, unusual, compelling, is not merely his size, 
his game or his name, although those all seem like pretty fair places to start. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in a farmhouse in rural Frances, Wash., where Roger Givens 
delivered his first son himself. Roger, a landscape architect and jack of all 
trades, named the newborn omm'A. The omm comes from the Hindu mantra. Roger, a 
Native American, added the apostrophe and the A to the name so it would be 
unique. 
</P>
<P>
 omm'A Givens' life has been nothing, if not unique. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, where he will play this season, huge things are forecast for the 
freshman with the big man's game and the unusual name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see, he's 6 foot 11, he's got size-18 feet, he's very, very mobile, 
he's got more God-given ability than any center at UCLA since Bill Walton," 
Bruin Coach Jim Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Givens' God-given ability was last seen when he played basketball in Aberdeen, 
a small logging town and seaport in southwest Washington known mainly for the 
Weyerhauser lumber mill on the river and as the hometown of the late Nirvana 
leader Kurt Cobain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the winter, during the basketball season, it is a city painted gray. 
Aberdeen is so close to the ocean, the prevailing winds bring clouds in as 
guests that don't leave for months. 
</P>
<P>
 In the omm'A Givens era, there was no room for gloom inside the gym. Aberdeen 
basketball Coach Brad Fuhrer said his most prized player is destined to become 
even better. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of his sophomore year, I'm looking forward to seeing how good he 
is," Fuhrer said. "He has the physical tools to go beyond college. He has the 
inner drive, what it takes inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Take a look inside omm'A's universe and what you see might be surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, when he was little, omm'A's universe was very small. Roger Givens 
kept it that way for his sons, omm'A and Maori, whom he had named after New 
Zealand's aborigines. Roger made certain that their world revolved around him, 
basically to keep their mother, Janice, out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger was convinced that Janice was dangerous and unfit to be a mother. He 
said she was a religious fanatic, a cult figure, a witch. He once told her that 
he would rot in jail before he would turn the kids over to her. 
</P>
<P>
 So he kidnaped them. They were gone for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty hectic," omm'A said. "I don't know where to start." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Janice and Roger never married, but that seemed to be only a technicality in 
their relationship. After all, they had known each other since they were 12, 
living in San Diego, and they had struck up a relationship again after Janice's 
first marriage failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger and Janice, an African-American who also had two daughters, produced 
omm'A and Maori. If not idyllic, their life seemed reasonably normal. Janice 
got a job teaching in Seattle, while the rest of the family lived on a farm 
near Frances, about 100 miles southwest. When Janice returned to Frances, 
things started getting a little crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, Roger burned the farmhouse in a scheme to collect insurance money. 
According to Janice, Roger had planned it so he could get all of his belongings 
out. He had timed how long it would take to start the fire, run to the 
neighbor's house to call the fire department, then run back and empty the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the day Givens chose, the neighbor wasn't home, so Givens had to run to 
someone else's house and use the phone there. 
</P>
<P>
 "So by the time he got back, his stuff got burned up," Janice said. "Yeah, he 
had a plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the family lived in the barn and omm'A slept in the chicken coop. 
He was not yet 5, but he was learning to cope. For him, as well as the rest of 
the family, the bathroom was the nearby woods. 
</P>
<P>
 When the relationship between Janice and Roger grew rocky, they decided to 
live apart. Roger, who wanted custody of the boys, decided he would take omm'A 
and Maori, leaving Janice with her two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 For six months, Roger, omm'A and Maori lived on another farm in Onalaska, 
Wash. When Janice learned where they were, she and the girls rejoined them and 
Roger came up with another plan. In what was to become a pattern, the plan 
involved traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pops took everybody to California," omm'A said. "He told me he had to take me 
somewhere, that we couldn't live up there." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Givens clan arrived in San Diego, where Roger again abandoned Janice 
and the girls, warning Janice that she was not to come looking for him, and 
took the boys back to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Janice three months to summon the courage to force a showdown. Roger, 
omm'A and Maori were living again on the farm in Frances. Janice and a 
sheriff's deputy confronted Roger, who wielded a tire iron. 
</P>
<P>
 So Janice came up with a plan of her own. She sold the farm shortly before 
foreclosure and when Roger showed up to claim the proceeds from the sale, she 
had him arrested. Even so, Roger refused to back down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he would rot in jail before he would turn the kids over to me," 
Janice said. "Why? Because I was a Christian. He said that I was a fanatic. But 
I got the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Janice then met John Lead and married him in December of 1982. Roger was 
awarded visitation rights, however, and Janice was not happy about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'As soon as you do that, he's going to run,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, he did. Roger picked up 7-year-old omm'A and 5-year-old Maori from 
Janice for a weekend visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lady across the road said they let out a whoop, they drove down the road 
and that was the last I saw of them for 2 1/2 years," Janice said. 
</P>
<P>
 Being on the run turned out to be an exhilarating experience for omm'A. Roger, 
earning money from odd jobs, drove his convertible to San Diego, then on to 
Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and South Dakota, finally winding up in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had just enough (money) so we could live OK," omm'A said. "We never missed 
any meals or anything. He told us we weren't coming home. We cried initially, 
but once we woke up the next morning, well, we were all right. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved that convertible and we would always sleep with the top down, so it 
was always fun. We didn't really miss home that much. We didn't get along with 
our stepdad, you know. It was like a big vacation, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Janice tried to track them. She contacted organizations that search 
for missing children. She sold her belongings to finance the search effort. She 
got behind in her bills and her telephone was disconnected. She nearly gave up 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one close call, omm'A remembered. Roger and the boys were 
staying with relatives in Imperial Beach and Janice's niece saw them. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad freaked," omm'A said. "He said 'Let's get out of here, man.' We, like, 
packed up all this stuff in two minutes and we were gone. He wouldn't stay in 
California after that." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Roger considered changing their last name to Alexandros. But 
then, he had always seemed to be big into names. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Mannan was Givens' friend for more than 15 years. Mannan, who runs a plant 
nursery in Frances, shared a love of trees with Givens, whom he called "Leo." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a total Leo," Mannan said. "It was his sign -- outgoing, friendly. 
Everyone called him Leo. He probably named himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Givens was the type of person others loved to be around, Mannan said. Mannan 
surely did. They both belonged to the Northern Nut Tree Assn. and talked a lot 
about trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were nut tree freaks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so friendly. People around here driving on the streets would just, 
like, get in a wreck to stop and say hello to him and give him a hug if they 
saw him. It was amazing the power he had. I think omm'A picked up a lot of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger allowed omm'A and Maori to write letters to Janice, which omm'A 
remembers doing a few times, but Janice says she never received any and 
suspects they were never mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "On their birthdays, omm'A and Maori have told me since, he would tell them 
that Mom doesn't care anything about them because she didn't send them 
anything," Janice said. "I never knew where they were, so I couldn't do it. 
That sort of bothers me. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of things you don't really realize that they are in there, but 
they are sort of festering. I think my kids are carrying stuff like that. I 
know one of them is." 
</P>
<P>
 Maori, 16, has spent most of the summer in juvenile detention because of drug 
offenses. But Janice thinks Maori is coming around and has enrolled him at 
Aberdeen High. In a touch of irony, she has made plans for him to run on the 
cross-country team. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother said Maori simply hasn't come around yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad, he always liked me more," he said. "I was bigger and everything. I 
didn't get spankings. Maori always would get them. I sort of feel bad for him 
because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger and the boys were in Houston for nearly two years. One day, Roger got 
into a fight and the police took him to the station, where they ran a computer 
check and discovered his history. Janice got a call, the boys flew to their 
aunt's house in San Diego to meet her, then went back to Washington, to South 
Bend, south of Aberdeen . 
</P>
<P>
 The odyssey was over. Roger Leo Givens Alexandros moved to Seattle and his 
elder, taller son set about trying to become an ordinary school kid. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy, especially because omm'A had to make up for the years he lost. 
Rolf Olson, the basketball coach at Raymond, saw omm'A in the fifth grade and 
began tutoring him. It was a long, difficult task, made even tougher because 
omm'A was still having trouble getting along with his stepfather. There was 
also a racial problem, Raymond being nearly all white. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys, they liked to call me . . . " omm'A said. "I didn't get along too 
well there. I basically didn't have any friends. I was totally different. I was 
an outcast." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the friction at home, omm'A moved out for a year and lived with 
Olson. Givens was beginning to excel at basketball and nothing was going to 
stop him -- not being called "Omaha," not being a black in a white school, not 
even the growing pains he experienced in his legs. Janice remembers being told 
that her omm'A simply wasn't trying hard enough, but she knew that his legs 
hurt when he ran. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of his sophomore year, omm'A wanted to play at a bigger school. He 
had played AAU basketball with some of the Aberdeen players and found out a lot 
about the city and school. So he moved to Aberdeen, where he lived with first 
one family, then another, and eventually Fuhrer, the coach, until Givens' 
family could join him. 
</P>
<P>
 When the rest of the family arrived, they settled comfortably in a white frame 
house. Everything seemed in place. Then, they learned, omm'A's father had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Janice's wishes, omm'A re-established contact with Roger and went to 
see him in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to him about his lifestyle," omm'A said. "I warned him that AIDS was 
out there. He already knew he had it. So he told me. We sat there on the road 
and started crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was April. It wasn't very long after that, he was starting to fall 
apart. His speech was a little blurry. It affects people differently. There 
were a lot of people in his house. He lived on Lake Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back from a basketball camp to see him again and he couldn't talk at 
all. It was really strange at his house. All these people, they had taken 
everything -- his TV, his money, all of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sad watching him go like that. He was so proud, you know. He was so 
skinny and rickety." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Roger Givens died in his big house on Lake Washington, Janice visited 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Roger Givens that I knew and had done all this stuff to me personally, 
omm'A's telling me he's changed and I'm thinking to myself, 'No way,' " she 
said. "But omm'A saw something and when I went up there myself, I saw it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's why the Lord had me go up there. I didn't hate Roger, but it 
was close to hate as you could get. It was something that I had to struggle 
with as a Christian. When I saw him, I said, 'Roger, where are you?' I heard 
this little teeny voice, 'I'm in here.' It was just so weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I saw him, all I said was, 'Roger, what have you done to 
yourself?' He didn't really say anything. He was just real sad." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most revealing aspect of the omm'A Givens saga is that his future as a 
basketball player might be more compelling than whatever happened to him in his 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 He became the greatest high school basketball player in state history, putting 
his name ahead of Clint Richardson, James Edwards, Steve Hawes, Detlef Schrempf 
and Doug Christie. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonny Vaccaro is one of the top judges of high school talent. He runs a number 
of summer high school basketball camps, conducts the Magic Johnson all-star 
game and is a top sports-marketing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has had to overcome, well, you name it," Vaccaro said of Givens. "He 
wasn't catered to. He wasn't your spoiled little brat, high school All-American 
who has had everything handed to him. Because omm'A has had to overcome so many 
personal things, that's the biggest reason I think he'll make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Vitale, a former coach and now a college basketball commentator for ESPN 
and ABC, was impressed with Givens after seeing him play in a high school 
all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very active, shot-blocker, looks like he could be a big factor," Vitale said. 
"He has the work ethic, the right parts. Let's hope life gives him a fair 
shake, because he hasn't had much of one yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrer said Givens will improve dramatically, practicing with and playing 
against players of much higher caliber than he faced while at Aberdeen. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least he's got the opportunity, and that's more than 99% of the kids can 
say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Givens averaged 18.4 points and 8.8 rebounds as a junior, when Aberdeen was 
23-4 and finished fourth in Washington's Class AA state tournament. He averaged 
23.8 points as a senior and shot 62%, despite constant double-teaming and 
frequent triple-teaming. Aberdeen was 21-6 and was runner-up in the state 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a once-in-a-coach's-career, basically," Fuhrer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Givens committed to UCLA early after visiting only UCLA and Arizona, although 
he was allowed five visits. Lorenzo Romar, an assistant on Harrick's UCLA staff 
and a former Washington Husky, recruited Givens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very impressive that he is where he is today," Romar said. "Somehow, 
he's gotten through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amazing. The kidnapings, the racial remarks, the constant stares, how tall he 
was, his dad, it's not like something you could even make up. This is TV stuff. 
It's like, 'Listen to this story.' " 
</P>
<P>
 There is going to be more to this story, a lot more, Vaccaro believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will be a premier player in America, no question," Vaccaro said. "It's not 
so much he's gifted-gifted. He's not Rasheed Wallace. But he'll push himself. 
He's not the greatest center I've ever seen, but he is going to be very good. 
Can he be as good as Eric Montross? Yeah. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he keeps fighting, he'll get a lot of pro contact. Putting himself at this 
level is a miracle. The rest, well, this is just playing a game now."

ROSE BOWL TICKET FLAP PROMPTS NEW RULES; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE U.S. DEPARTMENT 
OF TRANSPORTATION TRYING TO MAKE SURE TOUR OPERATORS HAVE GAME TICKETS BEFORE 
SELLING PACKAGES TO FANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Transportation is planning to regulate certain 
special-event tours in connection with football bowl games this season as a 
result of the 1994 Rose Bowl ticket controversy, federal officials said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed expanded protection of Super Bowl tour rules comes as a response 
to complaints filed by almost 800 University of Wisconsin fans who were left 
stranded outside the Rose Bowl in Pasadena last winter without tickets to the 
game against UCLA. Many of the fans had to payinflated prices to scalpers to 
see Wisconsin play in the Rose Bowl for the first time in 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed rules would be expanded to include such intercollegiate events as 
bowl games and the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament. The regulations are 
expected to be codified after public hearings are concluded this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not tolerate 'personal fouls' committed against sports fans," said 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena, whose department oversees air 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 James Doyle, Wisconsin attorney general who sued three ticket brokers and 
blamed UCLA for an inflated ticket market, suggested the government broaden the 
rules to include the Olympics and World Cup soccer finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Bowl rule requires air tour operators to have game tickets in hand 
or a written contract for the tickets before it can advertise a travel package 
as including tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who do not receive their promised game tickets must be refunded the 
entire tour price, a department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In writing to federal officials, Doyle said the rules should be limited to 
competitive events instead of concerts or other entertainment because the 
participants in and locations of the activities are determined close to the 
event date. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA's Special Events Committee has not discussed the proposed guidelines, 
but staff liaison Keith Martin, NCAA director of accounting, said it is not 
considered a major issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many within the NCAA automatically fear any government intervention 
in college athletics, Thomas Hansen, commissioner of the Pacific 10 Conference, 
welcomed the consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bit like selling cruise packages when you don't have a ship," 
said Hansen, a member of the Special Events Committee. "(The NCAA) can't reach 
out and control them. We certainly want people to be able to buy with 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 That confidence was eroded in the Rose Bowl situation when it was learned that 
a UCLA football booster, Angelo M. Mazzone III, and his business partner might 
have earned as much as $400,000 from tour packages put together through 4,000 
Rose Bowl tickets obtained from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction angered football fans from UCLA and Wisconsin who were unable 
to get extra tickets or had to pay scalpers' prices to attend the Rose Bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wisconsin law firm filed a class-action lawsuit against UCLA on behalf of 
Badger fans. A Wisconsin court has taken UCLA's motion for dismissal under 
advisement. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Olson, the Madison, Wis., attorney who filed the suit, was skeptical that 
expanded regulations will protect fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me to be a politicians' approach to deal with a problem on its 
periphery," he said. "They're saying it is a violation to break a contract, and 
I don't know if we need a law to tell us that."

CS FULLERTON'S HOLLAND TAKES JOB AT SAN DIEGO; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: COACH WILL 
REPLACE EGAN AFTER POSTING 23-31 RECORD IN TWO SEASONS WITH TITANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brad Holland, whose two-season basketball coaching tenure at Cal State 
Fullerton went from high hopes to growing uncertainty, has resigned to become 
the coach at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 John Easterbrook, the new Fullerton athletic director, was in his office 
briefly Monday and learned of Holland's resignation on the eve of his first 
official day on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not immediately available for comment, and an athletic department 
spokesman said he would have no reaction until he has had time to study the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Preseason practice is scheduled to begin Oct. 15. Bob Hawking, one of 
Holland's assistants and a former coach at Simi Valley High and assistant at 
Pepperdine, is a possible choice as an interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland, previously an assistant at his alma mater under UCLA Coach Jim 
Harrick for four years, replaces Hank Egan. Egan resigned Aug. 31 to become an 
assistant with the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland told his Fullerton players of his decision Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were startled and caught off guard," Holland said. "I told them that I 
understand that the timing is difficult. I think a lot of them felt 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego plays in the West Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always admired the West Coast Conference," Holland said at a San Diego 
news conference. "It has both quality coaches and quality student-athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland's contract at Fullerton was through the 1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed a three-year contract with a one-year rollover clause. That contract 
was extended for one year under that clause after his first season. The Titans 
finished 15-12, which was Fullerton's first winning record in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans also had a 10-8 record in the Big West Conference, finishing fifth, 
and along the way defeated every team in the conference except New Mexico 
State. The Titans ended the regular season with a one-point victory over Nevada 
Las Vegas. After that season, Nevada sought permission to talk to Holland about 
its coaching vacancy, which eventually went to Pat Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 The next season, however, turned sour before it began. Starting guard Don 
Leary was ruled academically ineligible and two other players, guard Chris Dade 
and forward DeVaughn Wright, were sidelined because of injuries before the 
first game. Then Todd Satalowich played two minutes in the opener and was 
sidelined for the rest of the season because of recurring back problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans fell to 8-19, the worst record at the school since the 1980-81 team 
went 4-23.

KINGS, DUCKS URGED TO OPPOSE A CAP ON NHL ROOKIE SALARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring that accepting a rookie salary cap would be a dangerous precedent, 
Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., on Monday urged 
players on the Kings and Mighty Ducks to present a united front in the union's 
bargaining with the league. 
</P>
<P>
 When talks resume today in New York, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman is expected 
to respond to a proposal submitted Friday by the players.That plan calls for 
clubs that exceed a preset revenue level to pay a 5% levy that would help 
sustain teams in smaller cities with less revenue. The sides have 11 days to 
reach an agreement before the 1994-95 season opens. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadien goaltender Patrick Roy told the Le Journal de Montreal he favors a 
rookie salary cap. "The way I see it, that might save the small-market teams," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other players have said they would concede that point if it meant they win 
other points, such as looser free-agency rules and the abolishment of 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow cautioned players that agreeing to controls on first-year salaries 
would ultimately depress all players' salaries. He also said Roy's belief is 
not prevalent within the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow also said the union would consider playing a second successive season 
without a collective bargaining agreement if negotiations carried past Oct. 1.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MADDOX'S CONTRACT IS RESTRUCTURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams have restructured backup quarterback Tommy Maddox's contract, 
reducing his salary from the $875,000 he was earning with the Denver Broncos to 
a one-year deal in excess of $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his salary was cut, Maddox will become a restricted free agent at the 
end of the contract if the Rams don't re-sign him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams assumed the final two years of Maddox's four-year, $4.4-million 
contract with Denver when they acquired him in an Aug. 27 trade, giving up a 
fourth-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams covet Maddox, a third-year pro and former UCLA standout, for his 
value after this season. The Rams will be free to match any offer a team makes 
for him, and will receive draft picks as compensation should he sign elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox, who is third-string behind Chris Miller and Chris Chandler, has been 
inactive for the first three games of the season but could move to 
second-string if Miller, who has been battling shoulder and rib injuries, can't 
play Sunday at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, who played the last 2 1/2 seasons with Arizona, blamed the 0-3 
Cardinals' offensive woes on new Coach Buddy Ryan's firing of offensive 
coordinator Jerry Rhome in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting rid of Jerry was their biggest mistake," Chandler said. "Jerry didn't 
get enough credit for the offense doing well, and when it didn't go well, he 
got way too much of the blame." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona is ranked last in the NFL in total offense (242 yards per game) and 
has scored only three touchdowns this season. Cardinal quarterbacks Steve 
Beuerlein and Jim McMahon are ranked last in the league in passing efficiency, 
and Arizona averages only 69.3 yards per game rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhome is now the Minnesota Vikings' receivers coach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said the Rams are in the market for an offensive lineman and 
wide receiver because of injuries from Sunday's loss to the 49ers. Offensive 
tackle Darryl Ashmore (sprained right knee ligament) and wide receiver Richard 
Buchanan (pulled right hamstring) are expected to miss two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 With the injury to Ashmore, the Rams are expected to place starting left guard 
Keith Loneker, who suffered a fallen left arch against Atlanta two weeks ago, 
on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Steve Israel (tendinitis in left knee) will miss a couple of days 
but should return to practice later in the week, Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Robert Young's two sacks Sunday against San Francisco give him 
four for the season, tying him with five others for third place in the league. 
. . . A struggling Ram offense has given opportunity to punter Sean Landeta, 
who ranks third in the NFC with a 44.9 average. MIKE REILLEY

MILLER REMAINS SORE AFTER INJURING SHOULDER; RAMS: QUARTERBACK UNCERTAIN OF HIS 
STATUS FOR SUNDAY'S GAME AGAINST KANSAS CITY. BACKUP CHANDLER SAYS HE'LL BE 
READY IF CALLED UPON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' latest quarterback situation was painfully clear Monday when Chris 
Miller and Chris Chandler walked side-by-side on their way to a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, the incumbent starter, held his right throwing arm bent at his side 
and rubbed his sore right shoulder with his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, the backup, walked pain-free. 
</P>
<P>
 So who will start on Sunday against a Kansas City Chief pass rush that 
features Derrick Thomas and Neil Smith? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams remain mum, but Chandler, acquired in the off-season as insurance for 
the oft-injured Miller, said he's preparing himself as if he is the starter. "I 
always do anyway," he said. "But considering (Miller) is all banged up, it adds 
a little more importance." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Miller: "Right now, it's just day-to-day. I've definitely felt better but 
I'm going in and getting treatment and doing the things I need to do to get 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox stuck with his tradition of not making personnel decisions on 
Mondays. But Knox said Chandler would start Sunday if Miller isn't recovered. 
"We'll wait and see what develops," Knox said. "If Miller isn't ready to go, 
Chandler will. We'll know more on Miller's situation in a couple days." 
</P>
<P>
 He has come back from knee operations in the last two seasons, sat out the 
exhibition opener because of a sore abdomen and received three pain-killing 
injections in his rib cage before the Atlanta game a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he got an injection for a nerve he pinched in his right shoulder when 
he was sacked by San Francisco's Dana Stubblefield in the second quarter of the 
49ers' 34-19 victory at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 During his seven seasons in Atlanta, Miller was often criticized for his lack 
of durability. Does Knox have similar concerns now, considering that the team 
invested a three-year, $9-million contract in Miller? 
</P>
<P>
 "The injuries he had before were to his knees," Knox said. "It's unfortunate 
that he has the rib cartilage and now the pinched nerve. But those things 
happen. That's the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern we had about him when we brought him here was about his knees. 
But that was cleared up. There are a lot of guys who get banged up around the 
league. Look at how many quarterbacks were out last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Through three games, Miller has the lowest completion percentage in the league 
-- 24 of 55 for 43.6% -- and ranks 26th in the league in passing efficiency. He 
has passed for two touchdowns, had four passes intercepted and hasn't brought 
any consistency to a Ram offense that ranks 24th in the league.

BALTIMORE OFFER HAS TIME LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lucrative offer for the Rams to move to Baltimore remains intact, but it now 
apparently includes this addendum: for a limited time only. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting that ended late Sunday night in Los Angeles, Maryland Governor 
William Donald Schaefer and Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos were assured 
by Ram President John Shaw that they would not be strung along as the Rams, who 
are also being courted by St. Louis and Hartford, Conn., explore relocation 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor's essential message was, 'Don't leave us on the hook forever,' " 
said Mark Wasserman, secretary of Maryland's Department of Economic and 
Employment Development. "He wanted some sense for how this process will play 
out, and Mr. Shaw indicated rather clearly that he hoped to arrive at some sort 
of decision within four to six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Baltimore are also interested in buying the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers, so the sooner the Rams make a decision, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 And they indicated that their offer, which includes a $160-million, 
72,000-seat, 108 luxury-box stadium with revenues from tickets, luxury suites, 
club seats, parking and concessions going to the team, would not be sweetened 
to compete with Orange County and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting marked the fourth between Angelos and Shaw in Los Angeles -- Ram 
owner Georgia Frontiere did not attend -- but Wasserman stressed that the 
governor's presence didn't add any significance to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had planned this visit by the governor (to promote Maryland film 
production) for quite some time, so don't rush to inaccurate conclusions," said 
Wasserman, who was at the meeting. "I mentioned to Peter that we'd be out here, 
and he thought it would be timely for the governor to make contact with the 
Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said in a recent interview that two of his concerns about moving to 
Baltimore was Washington Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke's plans to build a 
stadium in Laurel, Md., about 20 miles south of Baltimore, and whether a 
$160-million financing package would remain in place when Schaefer's term as 
governor expires in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message was reinforced by Schaefer that anyone who has any true 
understanding of the Baltimore/Washington market knows they're completely 
different, unique," Wasserman said. "He emphasized that we sold every luxury 
box (during the expansion process). The Baltimore market stands on its own, and 
the tremendous success of the Orioles clearly has the attention of the Rams and 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman, however, said Schaefer could not guarantee the financing package 
beyond January. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's somewhat beyond this administration's ability to speculate over," 
Wasserman said. "But if the Rams decide to move here tomorrow or next month, 
the (stadium construction) process would move rapidly."

</P>
<P>
 Young quarterbacks such as Maddox, 23, are expected to be in demand because of 
expansion franchises in Charlotte, N.C., and Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox, playing behind Chris Miller and Chris Chandler, has been inactive for 
the first three games.

 Coach Chuck Knox said the Rams are in the market for an offensive lineman and

receiver Richard Buchanan a pulled right hamstring. Each is expected to be

 The Baltimore Sun reported that Rams executive vice president John Shaw told 
Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer that the team probably will decide 
whether to move in the next four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer met with Shaw and a pair of team attorneys in Beverly Hills on Sunday 
night, said Mark Wasserman, secretary of the Maryland Department of Economic 
and Employment Development, who also was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good, useful exchange. There's no substitute to meeting their 
decision-makers face to face," Wasserman said. MIKE REILLEY

HIS GOAL IS TO LEAVE OTHER TEAM IN CHECK; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: UCLA'S MCCULLOUGH 
ADDS EXTRA PUNCH TO THE BRUINS' SECONDARY AT STRONG SAFETY.

<P>
 Football as a chess game? Seldom to a coach, and almost never to a player 
maybe because Sega Genesis football games don't use rooks or pawns or bishops. 
</P>
<P>
 And to a player who looks as if he tried to stop a stampede in Lincoln, Neb., 
with his body? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is kind of like a chess match," Abdul McCullough said. "If somebody has a 
move that you can't counter, they keep going to it and going to it, even if you 
know it's coming. . . . It's a real thinking man's game." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska had an option move that McCullough and other UCLA defenders were 
supposed to counter Saturday, and the Cornhuskers kept going to it and going to 
it. And, yes, he knew it was coming. He made 12 tackles, most among the Bruins, 
but made most of them downfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not have a good game," he said. "We lost." 
</P>
<P>
 There are few good defensive games that are lost, 49-21. 
</P>
<P>
 "His game wasn't that bad," said A.J. Christoff, who coaches the defensive 
backs. "It's just that he has set such a personal standard for perfection." 
</P>
<P>
 When in the fourth quarter it was clear that the perfection ship had sailed, 
McCullough stood on the sideline with the rest of the UCLA starters and decided 
that he was mad as hell and wasn't going to take it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Christoff in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I wanted to go back in," McCullough said. "It was more of a pride 
thing. I didn't want them to score 50 against us. That's what we do to (Western 
Athletic Conference) teams or something, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough went back in and made two tackles during Nebraska's final series, 
which ended on the UCLA six-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates said he was nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'You'll get hurt or something if you go back in,' " McCullough 
said. "They said that the game was lost, so let somebody else play." 
</P>
<P>
 Herb Meyer, the coach at El Camino High in Oceanside, could have told them 
what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abdul has the capacity to do one of two things: Either he can get people 
excited or he can get them (upset) at him," Meyer said. "It was part of his 
competitive nature. You find certain kids who only have one speed and that's 
with his throttle wide open, and he can't understand why everyone else isn't 
working at the same speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to sit on him. He meant well. He was a tremendous competitor and he 
played his butt off all the time, and he couldn't understand why everybody else 
doesn't. He's something different." 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that Abdul Jabbar McCullough was destined to bring that talent 
to UCLA from Macon, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was a question as to whether he was ever going to be able to show 
his football ability. He didn't play until his freshman year in high school, 
largely because he wasn't eligible earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 No, not because of grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd get all A's, but I'd get bad citizenship marks," McCullough said. 
"Sometimes I'd feel like I was a little too smart for my class. I wasn't (in 
the) gifted-and-talented (program), so I had to take some regular classes, and 
they bored me." 
</P>
<P>
 So he took it out on the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem with him was that he couldn't keep his mouth shut in the 
classroom, even though he was a good student," Meyer said. "He was the kind of 
guy that always had to have the last say." 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, he learned quickly. His first lesson was finding that he liked 
to hit people. That got him special-teams duty as a freshman and playing time 
at linebacker as a sophomore on the junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abdul started the first game, and after that we never got him off the field," 
Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 A move to strong safety in his senior season was made because El Camino 
coaches figured that was where he would get the most attention from college 
recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty. His grades and a 1,290 score on the Scholastic Aptitude 
Test helped. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother wanted him to go to UCLA or Stanford. He liked Washington and 
Arizona, but he liked Southern California more and so UCLA was the natural 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 After a redshirt season, he drew acclaim for his special-teams work and won 
the starting strong safety job this year. He leads the Bruins with 33 tackles, 
and his work against Southern Methodist cemented his role. He made one tackle 
after catching a pass receiver 62 yards downfield and later intercepted a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the only real tackler in a UCLA secondary of coverage specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people you can see running around the field, trying to avoid people," he 
said. "You've got to be like a missile: seek and destroy. Don't pass people by. 
Give them a little shoulder. I want people to be thinking that there's somebody 
waiting if they run a little slant route, or they're scrambling up the field. 
They think they'll just run into a (defensive back). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not into that. Most of our secondary is corners, skill guys. We've got to 
have someone who takes up the slack in terms of physicality. Our secondary is 
more in tune to playing Pac-10 teams that are going to pass against you."

PREP EXTRA; SOME COACHES TRYING TO EASE HARDSHIP CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Hauser knows good coaches have to expect the unexpected. And Hauser, 
Mater Dei girls' basketball coach, believes she can hold her own with the 
savviest designers of X's and O's. 
</P>
<P>
 But off the court, Hauser was admittedly unprepared to deal with the 
situations that confront many high school coaches in the 1990s: financial or 
personal problems in their student-athletes' living arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really did (expect those types of problems)," Hauser said. "Everybody 
in my family was very supportive when I was growing up, and I didn't face those 
things. Until you're put in that situation, you can't really comprehend it." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, coaches in Orange County -- and throughout the Southland -- lose 
athletes because circumstances force families to relocate. Consequently, 
coaches find themselves working with school administrators to help students 
secure temporary, alternative living situations that will allow them to 
complete school in one place. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauser experienced this scenario first-hand last year. One of her basketball 
players had a family problem that would have required her to leave school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the situation and asked myself, 'What's in the best interest of 
the kid?' " Hauser said. "You're talking about a 15-, 16-year-old kid and 
you're talking about (her) life. If I don't try to help this kid, what's going 
to happen to (her)?" 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Hauser and Mater Dei's administration, the student moved in 
with the parents of another Monarch student. She is still a member of the 
girls' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that situation worked out well, many others do not. Former Los Amigos 
football Coach Steve Bolton has witnessed the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see kids in trouble you want to help them," said Bolton, who now 
coaches the Lobos' offensive line. "You get so close to these kids, you just 
wish you could take them all into your house. You know you can't, so you help 
them by trying to find them other places (to live). 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had other people in our program take kids in. You just wish there was a 
way you could help them more." 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, some might view this type of intervention as improper. Hauser 
and Bolton disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't try to help them and something goes bad, you feel responsible 
because you could have helped them," Hauser said. "Isn't that what coaching is 
all about -- trying to help kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bolton: "You get so close to these kids. You say to yourself, 'These are 
(my) kids, and they're out there working hard and I've got to help them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section shares this view. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools that assist students in finding housing are not in violation of 
section rules forbidding undue influence of athletes, section Commissioner Dean 
Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For hardship reasons, we usually allow it," Crowley said. "We're seeing more 
and more financial hardship cases . . . more and more youngsters in broken 
homes. That's something that's beyond the youngsters' control." 
</P>
<P>
 The section requires financial or legal documentation when schools provide 
such assistance. Coaches cannot directly care for students, but they can work 
in conjunction with administrators to find other housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been growing, but we still probably get less than a dozen cases a year," 
Crowley said. "Sometimes we won't even get them because it's taken care of by 
school authorities and we won't have to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the apparatus is in place to assist students, some coaches choose not 
to get involved. Those coaches say their responsibility to students ends when 
the competition stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauser doesn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a personal decision," Hauser said, "and it's something I just feel I 
have to do."

CHRIS FOSTER: PREP EXTRA; NOW, SAINTS ARE OVER THE HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take a memo. 
</P>
<P>
 To: Santa Ana High School officials.  
</P>
<P>
 From: A casual observer.  
</P>
<P>
 Subject: Chickens come home to roost.  
</P>
<P>
 Face it guys, you blew it. You fired a legend. Dick Hill, the winningest high 
school football coach in Orange County history, was yours, and you shoved him 
out the door. Genius, pure genius. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the payback. 
</P>
<P>
 All Hill ever wanted to do was coach football. You wouldn't let him. Well, 
today he still coaches football, at Orange. On Sept. 29, he will coach football 
against Santa Ana. It's fitting, really. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, it's beneath Hill to think of such things, but a victory by Orange would 
make more than a few people grin.  
</P>
<P>
 It could also be county victory No. 199 in an illustrious career that began at 
Downey High School in 1956. But, hey, who's counting? Still, you might remember 
Hill did win a few games for you guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you gave him the boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, you may recall, retired from teaching in 1991. He'd done his share -- 
and then some -- in the classroom. He'd done as much on the field. The Saints 
won a Southern Section championship and five league titles in eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly surprising. The man won four section titles in 27 years of coaching at 
Downey, Santa Ana Valley and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he called it quits as a teacher, you folks in charge wanted to push 
him out to pasture. You don't teach, you don't coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's not a bad rule. But if ever there was an exception, it is Dick 
Hill. He is exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana football players needed more time than Hill could give as a teacher. 
He reached that decision after 16 of his players were declared ineligible in 
1991. A full-time coach was needed to push the players in the right direction. 
The right man for the job was right there. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill saw life as it was over there. Times had changed, so had kids. For that 
matter, so had parents. Some of them weren't around. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many young men need guidance because they don't have a father in their 
lives," Hill said. "Our society needs men who care about young people. God had 
blessed me with skill as a coach. I have a lot to offer young men." 
</P>
<P>
 But you told him to peddle it elsewhere. That's what he did. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an assistant at Foothill in 1992. The Knights reached the Division IV 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Hill wanted to remain close to home. He took the junior varsity job 
at Savanna. The Rebels went 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick was a blessing," Savanna Coach Fred Di Palma said. "He never swore or 
degraded the kids. He was more important as a role model than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmmm, a positive role model. Pretty poor qualification for a football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Hill reaches kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaching is an area where you can communicate on the kids' level," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Communicate? Hill, 65, would often play pickup basketball with his players. 
When was the last time any of you shot hoops with students? 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was set to coach the freshman team at Esperanza this season when Orange 
officials contacted him. The impact was immediate. 
</P>
<P>
 Former coaches around the school, guys with years of experience, returned to 
action. Suddenly, almost every Orange assistant was also a staff member. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every coach in Orange County should be required to work one season under 
Dick," assistant Ed Howard said. "He's taught me to expect more from kids so 
they will expect more of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, looks like your loss is Orange's gain. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing, gentlemen, Dick Hill does not hold a grudge. He's looking forward 
to the Santa Ana game with fondness, not vindictiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees life as a great experience where lessons are learned. Hopefully, you 
all learned yours.

PREP EXTRA; BEYOND X'S AND O'S; PROBLEMS OF TODAY FORCE MANY COACHES TO ACT AS 
CONFIDANTE, TUTOR, PARENT, FRIEND, AND SOMETIMES SAVIOR TO TROUBLED ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 You don't save every kid. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an athlete who played football at Santa Ana Valley and had problems 
with the law. A lot of problems. And that's why Coach Scott Orloff worked so 
hard to keep him involved in football, to see if the game might be a way out of 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 It was tough, real tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a barbecue," Orloff says, recounting the story, "and he stole a 
package of hamburgers from me. I told him, 'If you need something, come to me, 
don't steal from me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The door is open. Every athlete Orloff coaches has his home phone number. He 
has been called as late as 11:30 p.m. and as early as 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the athletes -- and sometimes they aren't even athletes, they're 
just students who have noticed an interested party -- need rides through 
troubled streets, or need help, or just need somebody to talk to so they can 
kill a lonely night. 
</P>
<P>
 But this kid, the football player, is in jail now for armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Him I failed on," Orloff says. "It doesn't always work out. But the ones you 
are successful with, they feel pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Orloff isn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Raya had heard the rumors. The ones about drugs. He doesn't coach 
football. He coaches girls' basketball. And he doesn't coach in a troubled 
Santa Ana neighborhood, but in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 And so he approached the girl because he was worried about the rumors, which 
turned out to be more than that. And he laid it out on the table in his office 
at El Dorado High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a lot at stake," he told her. "You have athletics to turn to, you 
have a coach that cares about you, and you don't need this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 And this kid, she was saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches get close to their kids. Sometimes too close. A few years ago there 
was a basketball coach who was found with one of her players in a car in Costa 
Mesa. Your basic compromising position. She crossed the line. 
</P>
<P>
 But kids need help. Sometimes they need discipline and sometimes they need 
love. And it's up to the coach, the adult in the relationship, to draw the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids get help -- and sometimes a lot of it -- from their coaches, who can 
serve as parents, pastors, tutors, counselors, confidantes, friends, 
disciplinarians, academic advisers and hospice workers. They help kids pass the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test and they help them pass into adulthood, though neither 
is easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Athletic Director Al Rosmino has been in education for four decades. He 
has watched high school students fear Vietnam, dance to disco, accelerate 
through the Me Generation and incorporate "dysfunctional" into their 
vocabularies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a whole new ballgame," he says, "and maybe school has become a social 
service center more than an educational program." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it has. School isn't what it used to be and neither are coaches. Their 
involvement isn't limited to drawing X's and O's or rolling a ball out on the 
floor. Today, their involvement centers around real-world problems. Athletes 
today, and kids in general, need more help than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 You talk to coaches and the same thing comes up. They keep talking about the 
way families have been torn apart by divorce. And if the parents are together, 
they're both working. There are very few homemakers who raise the kids and wait 
for their husbands to come home from work. That stereotype is history. 
</P>
<P>
 Latchkey children bring with them a whole new set of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many dysfunctional situations in our society," Aliso Niguel 
football Coach Joe Wood says. "It has really manifested itself to where the 
coach is wearing a ton of hats." 
</P>
<P>
 And the brims are wide. One of the best football players in Orange County 
spends his nights at his coach's house. He doesn't go home because he doesn't 
get along with his stepfather. There's the threat of violence. You're the kid's 
coach. He's 17 and has a future. What do you do? 
</P>
<P>
 What the hell do you do?  
</P>
<P>
 And this kid isn't alone. There are dozens of others who have found housing 
through their coaches. Not everyone's a star, and not everyone is on the 
varsity. But if anyone finds out, it can become a dicey subject. Opponents 
might think there is something against the rules going on, and often, the only 
thing that's really going on is human decency. 
</P>
<P>
 Most coaches are decent. And their role has expanded over the years. Today's 
high school athlete is too complex not to expand that role. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd Philpot learned his lesson. His first year of coaching in 1979, on the 
day before winter break, one of his Tustin swimmers came up to him. The kid had 
broken up with his girlfriend, and his dad wanted him to go to college, but his 
grades were down and he wasn't sure he would be able to get a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Philpot knew some people, so he told him they'll talk after the holiday. 
And then the kid hanged himself with some bedsheets. 
</P>
<P>
 "My christening," Philpot calls it. "That really hit me. These kids' problems 
are immediate." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a beautiful girl whose hair reached her waist, and she had the envy 
of all her classmates. One day, she came to school with it chopped off at her 
shoulders. She was upset about it but wouldn't talk to anyone -- except her 
swimming coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had been abused at home and finally cut her hair off so that dad couldn't 
grab her by the hair and slam her around the house," Philpot says. 
</P>
<P>
 He's got stories. Such as the girl in his physical education class who tried 
to kill herself by taking a bottle of pills. Philpot tried to get her out for 
the swim team, but she couldn't swim very well. So he made her the team manager 
and she handled all the clerical work. She finally felt needed, and she 
blossomed. Today, she's a preschool teacher working on her elementary education 
credential. 
</P>
<P>
 Go to any coach, and they can tell you stories, or tell you about someone in 
the coaching community who has stories. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the teen pregnancy issue. And the sexuality issue. And the abuse 
issue. And the harassment issue. And the race issue. And the drugs. And the 
alcohol. And the gangs who make for an uneasy walk to football practice at 
Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were having a barbecue at one of the coaches' houses in La Mirada," Orloff 
says, "and the coaches were sitting on the front porch with some of the 
linemen. A car pulled up in front. It looked like it was lost, so it was 
slowing down. All of a sudden, the kids hit the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say 'Hey, what are you doing?" 
</P>
<P>
 "One kid said, 'In our neighborhood, when a car slows like that, you duck.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Orloff knows the kid's telling the truth. He has had players shot at and 
players robbed at gunpoint for their jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Orloff, 30, was a coach at Century before he got to Santa Ana Valley. His baby 
son used to play with the child of one of his own players. 
</P>
<P>
 Players have come to him when they think they've gotten a girl pregnant and 
Orloff gives them the safe-sex speech. It has the same principles every time, 
and he always starts the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abstinence is the best policy," he tells them. "You're not financially or 
emotionally stable enough to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Orloff offers an aside to his interviewer: "Most of the time, that 
doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't, because Orloff knows what every coach and teacher in Orange County 
knows. Teen-agers are going to be teen-agers. And that means they're going to 
have problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The standard stuff is a problem with their boyfriend," says Mary Mulligan, 
who coaches girls' basketball at San Clemente. "Or they have a fight with their 
parents or a problem with a friend or teammate. Sometimes you have to help the 
kid with classes or talk to teachers or their parents. Or the parents are 
getting a divorce. Sometimes kids have a hard time communicating with parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the minor things, all standard operating procedure for coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Police Dept. and the California Dept. of Education ran a list 
once that drew a contrast between the 1940s and today's society. In the '40s, 
the top seven problems facing schools were talking, chewing gum, making noise, 
running in the halls, getting out of line, wearing improper clothing and not 
putting paper in the waste baskets. And the top seven today are drug abuse, 
alcohol abuse, pregnancy, suicide, rape, robbery and assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Jo Palladino is a sports psychologist so she knows about this stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaches who take an active interest and act in a caring and responsible way 
are doing immeasurable good that will continue to benefit these children 10 or 
20 years from now as the result of decisions they make under the coach's good 
influence," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes even more important for high school coaches to go above and beyond 
X's and O's, if it's within that coach's abilities to do so, and still respect 
the boundaries between themselves and their athletes. There is such a thing as 
over-involvement." 
</P>
<P>
 But you'll have a hard time convincing Raya of that. He has dealt with a 
myriad of problems as a coach, friend, academic adviser and a Dear Abby. It's 
tough, sometimes. You mention sexual issues, and he knows first-hand how 
difficult it is to counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm uncomfortable talking about it, a lot more than talking about alcohol and 
drugs," he says. "That's a subject where you run and hide, and I think you can 
understand why." 
</P>
<P>
 But he doesn't run and hide. "If someone cries out for help in those sexual 
areas. . . ." Raya says, not finishing the sentence. "If there's a kid crying 
for help, you have to deal with that." 
</P>
<P>
 So he gives them his perspective and tells a school counselor. Raya may wear a 
lot of hats, but "dunce" is not one of them. Can't keep something like that to 
yourself in a litigious society; he has to look out for his own well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more kids today are dealing with grief, too. A few weeks ago, a Dana 
Hills freshman football player burned to death a day before the first game. An 
entire school, Laguna Beach High, was affected by last year's firestorm. And it 
was football that students rallied around to get normalcy back into their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can deny the impact of sports on high school kids. It gives them a 
common bond, a direction, something to root for. And for those who play, it 
gives them role models. Raya has two former players now coaching, even though 
he is only entering his fourth year. That's the rewarding part, he says, 
because "face it, coaches aren't getting paid enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Not when there are stories like this: 
</P>
<P>
 There's a girl who is losing weight. And it's not as though she needs to lose 
the weight. But Raya finds out about it. So he goes to the girl's mother, who 
has her own suspicions of anorexia. She wants Raya to talk to the girl. So he 
does. "Just you and me," he tells her. And he finds out where the girl is 
coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, 'Hey, do we need to bring your mom into this?' And if she says yes, we 
do it, and if she says no, we bring in the high school counselor," Raya said. 
"She chose to tell her mom. But it was going to have to be one or the other 
because that's the obligation I have personally, not just as a coach, but as a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my obligation -- to help that kid whether she wants it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 You can't save every kid, but you can save some. And that kid, she was saved.

PROPERTY VALUES: A WEEKLY COLUMN BY RON GALPERIN: SELF-SUFFICIENT HOMES 
BREAKING NEW GROUND; ENERGY: ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY AND HEAT ARE 
BECOMING MORE SOPHISTICATED, BUT TOTAL ENERGY INDEPENDENCE IS STILL IN THE 
FUTURE.

 Sylmar residents Ivan and Elke Forbes like being self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 A 45-foot wind generator in their back yard services most of their electricity 
needs. The Forbes family also uses solar panels to heat their water, warm their 
home and run their refrigerator. When the sun is strong or the wind is really 
blowing, the Forbeses generate enough power to apply to the Department of Water 
and Power for a credit on their already low utility bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Baumgart and his family in La Crescenta have also whittled down their 
utility bill with an array of solar panels that heat the pool and spa and that 
power everything from the refrigerator to an indoor/outdoor train set. The 
Baumgarts don't need to worry about heating and cooling bills thanks to 
concrete floors that were specially designed to keep the home cool in summer 
and warm in winter. Most of the solar panels -- which cost $300 to $350 each -- 
have more than paid for themselves, Baumgart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Is energy independence coming to your home soon? Can solar panels and wind 
generators increase your property values? The answer to these questions is 
probably no -- at least in the near future. Alternative energy technology is 
becoming more sophisticated, however, and property owners can now at least 
begin to consider powering their homes without help from an electric or gas 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Forbes isn't sure he has broken even yet on the money he spent on a giant 
wind generator. He does, however, save a substantial amount of money on his 
utility bill and he has benefited from both federal and state tax breaks. The 
system's $20,000 cost may help explain why the Forbeses are one of the very few 
families in Southern California to have their home powered by the wind. Forbes 
says the highest monthly electric bill he gets is $70. Many homeowners also 
don't have the space or the inclination or the permission of local authorities 
to build a silo-like structure in their yard. Because they back up against a 
power company right-of-way, Ivan Forbes said, he has gotten no complaints from 
neighbors since erecting the generator more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The wind generator in Ivan Forbes' yard looks nothing like the ones you may 
have seen en route to Palm Springs. Instead, this generator has a round metal 
frame that lets in wind through vents. The wind then drives a series of 
spinning buckets. The energy then travels through an electronic system that 
converts it into AC electricity. The home is also powered with the help of 
solar panels -- also known as photovoltaic panels -- which heat both the water 
and the 2,000-square-foot house. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, solar power has been touted as a wave of the future for about 20 
years now. But there are more advanced technologies in use now and already, 
many solar thermal systems are being used to heat pools, spas and water for 
home use, said Bob Ellis, president of Environmental Solar Design Inc. in North 
Hollywood. Solar electric systems -- which actually produce electricity, as 
opposed to solar thermal systems which just heat water -- are more expensive 
and less well-developed, he said. "It's still a small percentage of the 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, who has been in the solar business for about 10 years, says he does a 
great deal of his business installing systems to heat pools and spas. "Pools 
are very expensive to heat," he said, "so solar panels enable people to better 
utilize their pool." A typical solar system costs between $2,500 and $6,000 to 
install. Not having to use gas or electricity to heat your pool can save $2,500 
in the first year alone though. The system works basically by pumping water 
from the pool through solar panels that attract the heat of the sun. The water 
circulates during the day and hot water is kept in an insulated holding tank at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are various types of solar water heating systems for the home -- some 
with and some without a pump, Ellis explained. The cost is generally about 
$2,500 to $4,000. The annual utility savings are about $300 to $600 for 
customers who currently heat their water with gas. The savings will be more 
significant for people who now heat their water with electricity or propane. 
</P>
<P>
 (Incidentally, there is a 10% federal tax credit for business and commercial 
uses of solar energy. But neither the state of California nor the federal 
government currently provide tax incentives for residential use of solar 
panels.) 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who live in remote parts of the Valley and Ventura County are now 
being encouraged to use solar power instead of hooking up to a utility. These 
so-called off-grid customers now qualify for a Southern California Edison 
program that allows the property owners to lease a solar system with a option 
to buy. "Homeowners in remote locations can get clean, quiet electricity," said 
Wayne Gould, manager of photovoltaic applications for Southern California 
Edison. "This allows us to provide electrical service to people who haven't 
been customers." He called the solar program a "harmonious marriage between us 
and third-party power providers who provide solar panels." 
</P>
<P>
 While solar-powered homes can provide much of the electricity needed to run a 
home, there are very few homes that are totally self-sufficient. This is 
especially true for residents who want to run lots of appliances at one time. 
There are a growing number of options though. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to learn about some of the options for energy self-sufficiency or 
so-called renewable energy is by taking a tour of the Forbes home and another 
energy-independent home in Oxnard. Local tours are being organized from 10 a.m. 
to 3 p.m. Oct. 15 by Real Goods Trading Corp., a Ukiah-based seller of 
renewable energy products. More information about the free tours is available 
by calling (800) 762-7325.

 The Ojai Valley Inn hopes to increase its appeal to women with a $16-million 
renovation that would include a new health spa and up to 60 additional guest 
rooms. The spa, featuring a beauty salon, aerobics studios and massage rooms, 
appears to have a good chance of getting the required permits.The new guest 
rooms, however, will have to overcome the Ojai area's tough slow-growth rules. 
. . . An Oxnard attorney, Gregory J. Ramirez, is co-chairman of an American 
Trial Lawyers Assn. group investigating the failure of orthopedic implants, 
including the alleged non-approved use of spinal screws. Ramirez says he's been 
receiving an average of six calls a day about the screws since they were 
featured on the TV program "20/20."

SPEEDY SAMARITAN PASSES TOUGH ROAD TEST; CRIME: O.C. MAN CHASES KIDNAP SUSPECTS 
30 MILES AT 95 M.P.H. THE WOMAN IS FREED; 2 MEN ARRESTED. 
</P>

<P>
 It was Johnny Pagnini's greatest race. 
</P>
<P>
 At the wheel of his newly bought vintage Corvette, the Costa Mesa motorcycle 
buff and sometime racer helped police capture two kidnaping suspects Sunday 
night after a zigzagging freeway chase at speeds topping 95 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagnini, who manages a Santa Ana motorcycle shop, gave chase after spotting a 
woman struggling with a man in the back seat of a car on the Costa Mesa Freeway 
in Santa Ana. The pursuit ended some 30 miles later in Long Beach after the 
suspects apparently disabled their car when they rammed his $40,000 sports car, 
which he had not yet insured. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagnini said that at one point he feared the woman was being pushed out an 
open car door at top speed, then worried he might be shot for keeping up the 
chase, even after the pair stopped to let the woman go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about that stuff -- and my kids," he said Monday. "It was just 
something I felt I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricardo B. Ramirez, 18, and Mario Garay, 21, both of Santa Ana, were arrested 
and were being held at Orange County Jail on suspicion of kidnaping and 
attempting to rape the woman, a Tustin resident who met the pair recently, 
Tustin police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who was not identified, was treated for minor injuries, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She and a female friend rode with the two men to a convenience store on 
McFadden Street in Tustin after 8 p.m., police said. While the friend was in 
the store, the suspects drove off with the victim, police said. They made their 
way to the Costa Mesa Freeway and Ramirez tried to sexually assault her in the 
car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagnini, 38, and his friend Cindy Jarvis pulled onto the freeway in his 
Corvette at about the same time -- heading to join friends at his hot tub after 
a day out riding motorcycles. He said he spotted the suspects' car, an 
Oldsmobile, and saw the woman fighting with a man in the back seat. Jarvis 
thought the two were playing until Pagnini pulled close behind and, in the 
light of his headlamps, saw the woman's terrified expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "The look in the girl's face is one I will never, ever forget -- the fright," 
he said. "Her face was against the back window and I could see the guy swinging 
at her." 
</P>
<P>
 The car then sped away, Pagnini said, but he followed it north on the San 
Diego Freeway. He said the woman fought furiously. A rear door flapped open and 
her leg flew out. Pagnini thought for a moment she was about to be pitched out 
into traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the suspects' car pulled over near Brookhurst Street exit and the woman 
got out. Pagnini dropped off Jarvis, who stayed with the victim until police 
arrived, and he took up the chase again. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cars hit speeds near 100 m.p.h., Pagnini said. They weaved in and out 
of traffic, briefly skittered onto surface streets and then ended up on the 
Long Beach Freeway. Pagnini said he pulled close alongside once to get a good 
look at the men. When he inadvertently got ahead of the suspects' car later, it 
rammed his Corvette and was apparently disabled in the collision. As the 
suspects' car stalled on an off-ramp, another motorist summoned police by pay 
telephone and the men were arrested without incident, said Tustin Sgt. Mike 
Pettifer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were grateful for the happy ending but advised would-be good Samaritans 
simply to take down a license-plate number and call police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out OK -- the suspects were taken into custody," said Pettifer. 
"Because it turned out OK, I guess the guy's a hero. But I certainly don't 
encourage people taking that much action." 
</P>
<P>
 Pagnini, badly injured in a freeway motorcycle crash eight years ago, said he 
probably would not have given chase if he hadn't left his portable phone at his 
store, Bikers Dream in Santa Ana. Nor was he lamenting the $5,000 in damage to 
his rare 1966 Corvette, which will never be in mint condition again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy for the girl. I'm happy she's alive," he said. "I didn't want 
to see those guys get away."

O.C. SKINHEAD FACES CHARGES IN 2ND SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A white skinhead accused of the shooting death of a middle-aged black man last 
week -- a slaying police now say was a probable hate crime -- was charged 
Monday with the attempted murder of two Latino men in a shooting last month, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say 19-year-old Jonathan Russell Kennedy, 19, now being held without 
bail at the Orange County Jail, shot Juan Vergara and Angel Campos Silia, 
apparently without provocation just after midnight Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 No motive has been discovered for that shooting, according to a police report. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy appeared in court Monday to face first-degree murder charges in the 
Sept. 15 shooting of 44-year-old Vernon Windell Flournoy and attempted murder 
charges in connection with the shootings of Vergara and Silia. At the request 
of his attorney, his arraignment was postponed until Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old juvenile, the second suspect in Flournoy's killing, has also 
been charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Flournoy's killing is the latest in a recent series of attacks against blacks 
and gays that some activists have contended is part of an escalation of hate 
crimes in Orange County. The assaults include the beating and stabbing Aug. 5 
of Ruben Charles Vaughan III, a 15-year-old black athlete at Santa Margarita 
High School by a large group of youths in a Trabuco Canyon cul-de-sac, and a 
Sept. 2 attack on two tourists in Laguna Beach, who said their assailants used 
an anti-gay slur. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were investigating the Laguna case as a hate crime. The 
district attorney's office declined to file hate crime charges in the Vaughan 
case, saying there was insufficient evidence to prove that race was a 
motivating factor in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Monday, Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said Kennedy, a 
tattooed man with a shaved head who is believed to have pulled the trigger in 
both incidents, "has been in the company of, and seen with, individuals who 
have been identified with white supremacist organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy has a criminal record as a juvenile, police said, but they did not 
offer details. Police believe he came to Orange County from Texas, and that he 
may be using an alias. The juvenile, who has not been identified, has a prior 
criminal history which police also declined to detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Though neither of the two suspects in the Flournoy shooting has been charged 
with a hate crime in connection with Flournoy's slaying, Lowenberg said, "from 
a layman's perspective, we probably have a hate crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said that Huntington Beach police continue to investigate the two 
shootings, and that if evidence warrants, the two men may be charged with hate 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to state criminal statutes, a hate crime is defined as "the 
interference through force or threat with an individual's civil rights" on the 
basis of such characteristics as race, religion, nationality and ethnic 
background. To sustain a conviction, prosecutors usually need to prove that a 
suspect deliberately singled out and attacked the victim because of racial or 
other characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that the two white men encountered Flournoy last 
Thursday in the 20300 block of Beach Boulevard at approximately 7:35 p.m. An 
argument of some sort ensued before Flournoy was shot with a small-caliber 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 No one located by police was close enough to hear what the argument was about 
or whether any racial epithets were used, according to Officer Mike Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
 Flournoy staggered into a nearby McDonald's restaurant and collapsed. He was 
later taken to Pacifica Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral arrangements for Flournoy, who lived in the same nearby gated 
apartment complex as Kennedy, have not been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on Vergara and Silia, both 22, occurred in the 7600 block of 
Amberleaf Circle, according to a police report. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that "two white males in their early 20s approached the 
victims in an alley and one suspect began shooting for no apparent reason. Five 
or six shots in rapid succession were heard, according to witnesses," the 
report states. 
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran said that a .22-caliber handgun was recovered in the area of the 
apartment complex after the Flournoy shooting. Police believe that the same 
weapon was used in both shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take ballistic tests to confirm," Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vergara was shot in the stomach and underwent surgery. Silia was shot in the 
thigh. Both have since been released from the hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said that while investigators were probing Flournoy's slaying, they 
"came across some evidence" which led them to charge Kennedy with the earlier 
shootings. The juvenile has not been charged in connection with that attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Kennedy, chairman of the Orange County Human Relations Commission, who 
also appeared at Monday's news conference, said Lowenberg asked him to document 
the details of the Flournoy shooting as a possible hate crime. Kennedy is not 
related to the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to come out with any conclusions," Kennedy said. But he said 
the attack fit the general profile of a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Wood, vice-chairman of the human relations commission, acknowledged that 
police and prosecutors must meet a different standard before filing a criminal 
hate crime charge, adding that "it's not as difficult for me to state that this 
is a hate crime. If they don't classify this as a hate crime I would be 
extremely disappointed and concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy emphasized that "Huntington Beach is not a center for this type of 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
 But some experts disagreed, including county civil rights activists and 
leaders of the African American community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huntington Beach has the largest nexus of hate groups in the county," said 
Brian Levin, a Newport Beach attorney who specializes in bias crimes, "with a 
greater proportion of skinheads groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Levin, who also serves as legal director of the Center for the Study of Ethnic 
and Racial Violence in Colorado, said "the city is known nationally for a 
significant number of these groups." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Huntington Beach City Council meeting, Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, 
dedicated the session to Flournoy's memory and called for a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said the crime "is not acceptable and will not be tolerated by this 
community. While there may not be a clear indication at this time that the 
murder was racially motivated, it is an appropriate time for the City Council 
of Huntington Beach to state that crimes perpetrated against against any 
resident or visitor to our community will not be tolerated.

CARTER SAYS EMOTIONAL APPEALS SAVED TALKS; DIPLOMACY: CEDRAS' WIFE RELENTED 
AFTER VEHEMENTLY OPPOSING DEAL WITH U.S. JONASSAINT GAVE FINAL OK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Jimmy Carter said Monday that his Haiti mission twice 
teetered on the edge of failure and the military leaders in Port-au-Prince were 
on the verge of deciding to fight to the bitter end -- only to be turned around 
by emotion-charged appeals from American negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 The first crisis came Sunday, when American negotiators confronted Yannick 
Cedras, the wife of Haitian military chief Raoul Cedras -- a strong-willed 
woman little known in America. She was mounting a powerful, behind-the-scenes 
argument against the Haitian junta yielding power and in favor of a fight to 
the death, Carter said in an interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Though her youngest son was just celebrating his 10th birthday, an impassioned 
Mrs. Cedras told the former President that her family's roots in Haiti went 
back 200 years and "they all (the family)) had agreed they would die before 
yielding to a foreign invasion." 
</P>
<P>
 The second crisis came hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 With time running out and only a few points remaining to be settled, Carter 
said Haitian Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby burst into the room with a portable 
telephone in his hand and shouted at Colin L. Powell, the former chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who -- along with Senate Armed Services Committee 
Chairman Sam Nunn -- had joined in the last-ditch effort to persuade the 
generals to step down before U.S. invaders swept the tiny Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would you do, if your troops didn't know what was going on and you heard 
that paratroopers at Ft. Bragg (N.C.) had been told to prepare for an 
invasion?" Carter said Biamby declared, suggesting the American negotiating 
mission was a trick designed to distract Haiti's military commanders on the eve 
of an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were considering leaving that room and marching down and defending their 
country," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former President, almost in tears, said he "made an emotional speech" 
decrying the damage a U.S.-led economic embargo had inflicted on the children 
of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said I was ashamed of what my country had done to their country," Carter 
recalled. "There's no way to lift the embargo or to provide food and medicine 
unless we find a way to end this peacefully. . . I said if I go back now and we 
don't have peace, what happens to the children?" Then he said to Cedras, "This 
whole thing boils down to your wanting to stay in office for a few more weeks 
or months." 
</P>
<P>
 After a moment, Cedras replied, "Let's go tell it to the president (Emile 
Jonassaint). And I said OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling across the street to the Presidential Palace, through a noisy 
throng, the generals and the negotiators laid the case before the 81-year-old 
former chief justice of Haiti's Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Clinton Administration had regarded the jurist as a powerless 
figurehead, Carter said that, in this final act of the chaotic drama, 
Jonassaint asserted ultimate authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the interim Cabinet angrily denounced the deal. The defense 
minister took the occasion to announce his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jonassaint, recalling his long life in Haiti -- including a role as 
chairman of the committee that drafted the nation's constitution in 1987 -- 
weighed in for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace. We want peace. We don't want war," Carter said Jonassaint told the 
generals. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and other Administration officials have repeatedly denounced 
Cedras and the other generals for corruption and brutal violations of human 
rights, including torture, rape and the murder of children. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carter said that throughout his conversations with Cedras, he was very 
impressed by what he considered the general's unselfish approach to the issue 
of stepping down. In talking with him, Carter said, Cedras was not asking for 
anything for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said he believes Cedras will honor the agreement now, though he said 
there was a moment Monday when Cedras concluded he had been betrayed and 
threatened to pull out of the deal once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said he was in touch with Cedras on Monday to ensure everything was 
going well. In fact, Carter said he had suggested he stay behind Sunday night 
in Port-au-Prince but Clinton told him he wanted him to come back to confer. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday morning, Cedras told Robert Pastor, Carter's Latin American specialist 
who went with him on the mission and has stayed behind, to be at the Haitian 
army's command headquarters at 9:40 because the situation seemed to be breaking 
down. Cedras told Pastor that it looked like he was being "betrayed" by the 
United States, Carter said, and he was thinking he would not cooperate after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob was frantic. He thought things were going to hell," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras was apparently worried that he would be forcibly ousted from the 
country by the arriving troops after all. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cedras and others watched Carter's television appearances on Monday and 
were mollified. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear which parts of Carter's comments the generals found 
reassuring. But Carter said they had repeatedly expressed resentment at the way 
Clinton and other Administration officials had denounced them as barbarous and 
corrupt dictators -- impugning their honor, as the Haitian generals saw it. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter by contrast, in a CNN interview and in other public remarks throughout 
the day, was careful to avoid critical rhetoric and instead praised the 
generals for putting their country's interest first and avoiding bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said he had made special arrangements to do the early morning interview 
before he went to the White House so he would be able to speak directly to the 
Haitian people and officials, outside the coordinated message of the Clinton 
Administration presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tense session with Mrs. Cedras, conducted at the Cedras home, Carter 
said the general's wife began to change her mind only after Powell, who is 
much-admired in Haiti, spoke to her about the true nature of military honor. 
</P>
<P>
 An American invasion would result in the destruction of the Haitian army, 
Powell told Mrs. Cedras, and her husband's highest obligation was not to die 
for his country but to preserve his army as an institution and spare his 
country the agonies of an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting with Mrs. Cedras came after a politically active Haitian 
acquaintance and the former American President's wife, Rosalynn -- who talked 
to Carter by telephone from Atlanta during a low point in the negotiations -- 
had encouraged Carter in particular to talk to Mrs. Cedras in hopes of 
improving chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said he and the Cedrases had gotten to know each other in 1990, when 
Carter was a leader of international monitors who oversaw the voting that made 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide the country's first freely elected president -- an 
election Cedras and his allies overturned in a bloody coup the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 General and Mrs. Cedras were both "deeply religious," Carter said he had 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The general invited Carter, along with Powell and Nunn, to visit his wife. At 
the house when the American negotiators arrived were Cedras' 17-year-old son, 
his 13-year-old daughter and the 10-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras remarked that, because he had been up around the clock dealing with the 
invasion threat, he had barely had a chance to speak to the boy on his 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter put the child on his lap. Searching through his pockets for something 
to offer as a present, all Carter could find was a blue pocket knife, a 
souvenir from the Carter Center. The young boy was delighted with it. 
</P>
<P>
 And at one point the general's daughter came running in with a photograph of 
Carter and herself that he had inscribed to her during a visit in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But the meeting soon turned serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation was extremely intense," Carter recalled. "We tried to engage in 
some niceties but she wasn't listening. She said her family had lived in Haiti 
for 200 years and her grandfather and father were of such stature that they 
could have been in public office but they preferred to work as patriots (in the 
private sector) in an environment of challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 "Any person who doesn't understand that Haitian people would rather fight and 
give up their life for their country doesn't understand Haitian people," he 
quoted her as declaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell told Cedras that he was highly intelligent and should have the wisdom 
to know that it would not be betraying his country if he were to protect his 
people by agreeing to a peaceful settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that it was more difficult to win peace than war," Carter said, 
"that it was a complex challenge that required multiple decisions. And he had a 
chance to make a historic decision." 
</P>
<P>
 They talked for about an hour. Carter said that when they finished, Mrs. 
Cedras was quiet for a long time. "Then she looked at her husband and he said, 
'Mr. President, I want you to go see President Jonassaint.' And I said let me 
meet with you at your headquarters. I don't need to go see him. And he said no, 
you go see the president, that's more important. You can't insult my 
president." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said he was later told by Cedras' brother Alex, who had acted as an 
interpreter, that his visit had done much to reduce Mrs. Cedras' resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said the idea for the mission was posed by a Haitian government 
acquaintance, who wrote him recently expressing his concern about the 
approaching confrontation with the United States and asking whether there was 
anything Carter could do. Carter said he passed the word that he would be 
willing to talk to Cedras, if the general wished; Cedras soon called. Their 
Roles in the Diplomatic Cliffhanger 
</P>
<P>
 Key players in the dramatic final hours leading up to the agreement Sunday 
night in Port-au-Prince: 
</P>
<P>
 THE AMERICANS 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Carter: As the talks appeared to be unraveling, the former President 
made an emotional speech decrying the damage a U.S.-led economic embargo had 
inflicted on the children of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Colin L. Powell: Much-admired in Haiti, he spoke to Mrs. Cedras about the true 
nature of military honor. The tense session eased her opposition to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Nunn: The Senate Armed Services Committee chairman joined in the 
last-ditch effort to persuade the generals to step down before U.S. forces 
swept the tiny nation. 
</P>
<P>
 THE HAITIANS 
</P>
<P>
 Raoul Cedras: Throughout his conversations with Cedras, Carter said he was 
very impressed that the general seemed unselfish about his role. 
</P>
<P>
 Yannick Cedras: Her behind-the-scenes movement against yielding power 
threatened the agreement. She told Carter she would die before giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 Philippe Biamby: The army chief of staff burst into the room after getting 
word that U.S. planes were launched. He wondered if the talks were merely a 
diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Emile Jonassaint: The Haitian negotiators turned to the 81-year-old Haitian 
president for the final decision. "Peace. We want peace," he told the generals. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel-Joseph Francois: The Port-au-Prince police chief was not a party to the 
agreement. He has gone into virtual hiding.

GIS ARE GREETED WITH CURIOSITY BUT LITTLE FEAR 
</P>

<P>
 Sixty years and 28 days after U.S. Marines gave up their last occupation of 
this tiny, battered Caribbean nation, American troops returned Monday and 
received a cautious, distant welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 They encountered no resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, they also did not find a warm welcome, either, as most of the 
businesses in this Haitian capital were shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets here early on were empty but for the cars of journalists and a few 
public buses. 
</P>
<P>
 As the afternoon wore on, though, crowds of Haitians -- including several 
hundreds of those who support exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- 
gathered at the docks and the airport to watch the American troops unload 
equipment and other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 They stepped up their chants of " Lavalas ! Lavalas !" -- which means torrent 
or flash flood. That expression serves as a rallying cry for Aristide's 
followers, referring to their efforts to wash away Haiti's autocratic past. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Monday, reporters estimated that close to 10,000 people clogged the 
streets in front of the port. No shots were heard. But Haitian police began 
pushing back the spreading mob, swinging billy clubs and pushing people away. 
An 8-year-old boy was run over by a car and killed in the melee. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the most dramatic incident on this day when the vanguard of a 
15,000-strong U.S. military occupation force -- largely support and command 
forces, not the assault troops whose presence had once been expected here -- 
began arriving about 9:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, for most Haitians, these were oddly uneventful times. Some people 
stood in doorways and on curbs, gawking at the American helicopters filling the 
skies or staring out at the warships approaching within a mile of 
Port-au-Prince's harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But more of the population was walking, going to get water, trying to find 
food at empty street markets, simply moving from one place to another. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared the prospect of an American occupation was no more important to 
their lives than last week's spacewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Americans arriving here, however, this was a day -- at least to start 
-- of tension and uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 The first troops -- a security unit that was supposed to protect Lt. Gen. Hugh 
Shelton, commander of the American forces, as he arrived here -- leaped off a 
heavily armed helicopter gunship onto the Tarmac of the civilian airport here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans wore black facial camouflage and full battle gear; they carried 
assault rifles and machine guns. They quickly assumed crouched, menacing combat 
positions as gunships painted lonely circles in the sky above and four-engine 
surveillance and communications aircraft circled even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The anxious, battle-ready Americans were met by a relaxed, rumpled Haitian 
officer: Brig. Gen. Max Mayard. The fourth-ranking officer in the Haitian army 
-- who is considered a nobody in the military -- wandered out of the terminal, 
saluted and put out his hand in welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 After some embarrassed looks, an American officer told the next contingent of 
U.S. troops to disembark normally. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their early chagrin, the American soldiers quickly took charge. The 
handful of Haitian soldiers present stood off to the side as the U.S. troops 
immediately set up traffic control and decided where the hordes of television 
crews and other reporters could stand. 
</P>
<P>
 One sergeant of the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division observed: "I don't know 
why I'm here. . . . I'm told to establish democracy and maintain neutrality 
with the Haitian army." 
</P>
<P>
 The troops who hit the ground first Monday were largely communications and 
logistics specialists, along with some security forces. Their numbers totaled 
about 1,800. A total American force of 3,000 to 4,000 was scheduled to arrive 
Monday but it was unknown whether all had landed before dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton's first act after arriving from his command ship about four miles off 
the coast was to drive to Haitian military headquarters to see Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras, the army strongman, in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding through the rutted, almost impassable streets in a black Cadillac 
limousine provided by U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing, Shelton was stared at 
impassively by clutches of Haitians gathered on the curbs in front of the 
shuttered businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a Toyota pickup truck crammed with about a dozen Haitian soldiers 
that followed about 50 yards behind, there was almost no sign of the army. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of soldiers stood in front of the open gates of the Presidential 
Palace, one slouching half asleep against a guardhouse, his rifle lying at his 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the military headquarters was free of anything resembling security, its 
only protection being speed bumps at each end of the street. Half an hour 
before Shelton's arrival, American reporters walked to the building's side door 
without being questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton told reporters that the objective for the day was to set up command 
and logistic facilities, leaving a wider occupation of the city for later. He 
set off waves of fright among some Haitians who support Aristide when he said 
that he would leave immediate control of the capital's slums to the Haitian 
military and police. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because those areas have been the scene of constant terror -- including 
reported murders, rapes and nightly shooting -- since Aristide was driven from 
office on Sept. 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all human rights observers and diplomats, including the Americans here, 
blame the terror on the Haitian army, saying as many as 3,000 Haitians have 
been killed in the last three years. President Clinton cited the human rights 
abuses to explain why Americans needed to be here to protect Haitians and to 
help them restore democracy here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gen. Cedras," Shelton said after meeting with the Haitian strongman, "will 
use his forces in some cases" of violent incidents in Cite Soleil, one of the 
region's most fetid slums and the site of near nightly incidents of military 
terror and violence. "There is no intention of U.S. forces going into Cite 
Soleil tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian forces were in control of that area Sunday night, when shots were 
fired randomly throughout the dark hours. Two bodies were found in the 
excrement-filled streets at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was not limited to the slums. Gunfire was heard even in the 
wealthy areas of Petionville and downtown close to the military headquarters -- 
even as the U.S. negotiating team, led by former President Jimmy Carter, had 
been talking with Cedras and Haitian military leaders to try to reach their 
landmark accord over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Cite Soleil residents were cautiously leaving their shacks and 
hovels to see whether the new American presence might have changed their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just came out of my house," said Gary Ekius, 15, who lives in a two-sided 
hut made of mud and broken cardboard. "I am glad they (the Americans) came. I 
think it will be better for me and Cite Soleil now. There will be less blood." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what he thought the Americans would bring to Haiti, Dominic Gete, 
24, an unemployed sugar worker, said, "A job. I haven't worked in two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking furtively around, Gete said quietly: "You know, I wouldn't have talked 
to you before because 'armed civilians' would have killed me. But now I think 
they won't hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Edner Joseph, who approached a reporter with a photograph album 
that included a picture of a teen-ager in a scout uniform. "The military came 
looking for me all this week," Joseph said. "Wednesday night, when I wasn't at 
home, five soldiers shot my boy, Cosnoy. He was only 16 and his body is in the 
morgue. Do you think the Americans will help me get his body and protect me?"

NEWS ANALYSIS; ARISTIDE'S SILENCE IS SEEN AS DISAPPOINTMENT IN PACT; 
LEADERSHIP: THOSE CLOSE TO SUPPOSED BENEFICIARY OF HAITI DEAL SAY HE WOULD SEEM 
UNGRATEFUL IF HE COMPLAINED.

<P>
 Holed up in an apartment on the edge of Chinatown here watching Cable News 
Network, ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is the invisible man 
in the agreement on the future of his tiny Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the day after President Clinton went on national television to 
announce plans to invade Haiti and restore Aristide to the presidency, the 
diminutive, bespectacled priest was at the White House praising the President 
at length for his new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But since Sunday, when Clinton's emissaries signed an agreement spelling out 
the departure from power of the military junta that ousted Aristide in 1991, 
there had been no word from the man who was supposed to be the prime 
beneficiary of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts who know Aristide and have watched him in Haiti and in exile stressed 
that his failure to make a statement can only be interpreted as disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 An American who has become very close to Aristide during his nearly three 
years of exile here says "it would not be helpful to him" if his reaction to 
the Port-au-Prince accord became public. 
</P>
<P>
 "A huge thing has happened and he has not said a word about it -- that is 
making a big deal about something in Haitian terms," said Amy Wilentz, whose 
book, "The Rainy Season; Haiti Since Duvalier," chronicled Aristide's rise as a 
rebel priest to spiritual leader of the Haitian people. 
</P>
<P>
 "His silence today speaks of his disappointment with this deal," she said. "He 
does not want to complain about it because he would look ungrateful. But he 
does not want to go out to parties and drink champagne because the Haitian 
people would think he was embracing the amnesty of the men who have caused them 
so much pain." 
</P>
<P>
 But those close to Aristide loudly criticized the agreement, saying that 
because it does not require his enemies to depart and instead potentially 
offers them complete amnesty for their crimes, it does little to further 
Aristide or democracy in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement does not serve the cause of democracy in Haiti," Randall 
Robinson, head of Trans-Africa, an African American lobbying group, said in a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson called it "impractical folly" to send Haiti's first democratically 
elected president back home and expect him to build a democracy when the 
military Establishment that ousted him is still in place and his enemies retain 
their assets and cannot be judged for the crimes they committed while in power. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton Wides, counsel to Aristide in Washington, told the Associated Press 
that the exiled president believes the agreement will allow more bloodshed 
because it gives the Haitian military leaders until Oct. 15 to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got four weeks to bump off as many of the people who might be helpful 
to the pro-democracy forces as they can in the coming (legislative) elections," 
Wides said. "It gives them another four weeks of the killing fields." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Barnes, Aristides' American lawyer, stressed that while he was briefed 
on the negotiations by Clinton foreign policy adviser Anthony Lake and William 
H. Gray III, his special envoy to Haiti, Aristide was in no way a participant 
in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Silence is a relatively new tool for Aristide, foreign policy analysts and 
observers said. He learned it from many frustrating months of trying to 
influence the fate of Haiti, they said, like a player without cards in a 
three-way game with U.S. policy-makers and the Haitian military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide came to the United States with a reputation for moving people with 
potent sermons, encouraging them to stand up against the ruling elite. 
"Everyone knows his speech is his most powerful weapon," Wilentz said. 
</P>
<P>
 But his three years in exile have taught him the need for quiet diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 After signing the Governors Island accord, an agreement that would have 
brought him back to power last October, Aristide complained of being in a 
"diplomatic straitjacket," recalled Laurie Richardson, a political analyst who 
lobbies on behalf of Haiti's democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide had been elected with 67% of the vote in a contest supported by the 
American government, yet he felt the terms of the 1993 accord were being 
dictated by U.S. negotiators and Haitian military commander Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide also responded to that agreement with silence. GOVERNME

JUDGE REJECTS BID TO DISMISS SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito on Monday rejected an attempt to have the 
murder case against O.J. Simpson dismissed, ruling instead that enough evidence 
exists to force the football hero to stand trial in the slayings of his ex-wife 
and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito also echoed a ruling by a Municipal Court judge who found that a 
warrantless search of Simpson's estate hours after the killings was legal 
because officers said they were concerned that other victims might be inside 
and need help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The detectives in this situation were confronted with a brutal and violent 
killing, multiple killings," Ito said, adding that the officers encountered a 
number of troubling signs when they arrived at the house before dawn June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under those circumstances, I feel that the actions by the detectives were 
justified," Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Motions to dismiss criminal cases at this stage rarely are granted, and 
defense attorneys had not held out much hope of succeeding in the Simpson case, 
so Ito's ruling Monday was widely predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing did, however, include a detailed description of the prosecution's 
version of the killings as well as of the latest surprise development in the 
unfolding murder mystery: Prosecutors revealed that they want to put Simpson's 
longtime assistant, Cathy Randa, on the witness stand to ask her when and why 
she shredded documents found during a search of Simpson's office. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, the documents discussed domestic abuse and were 
spotted by a Los Angeles police detective executing a search warrant in 
connection with the investigation of Simpson's friend Al Cowlings, who was 
arrested on suspicion of aiding the football legend when police believe he was 
trying to flee prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys, said later that the 
material consisted of pamphlets and brochures about domestic violence that 
Simpson received years ago as part of his court-ordered therapy after a 1989 
incident in which he pleaded no contest to spousal battery. 
</P>
<P>
 The detective attempted to seize the documents Aug. 12, according to Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, but was prevented from taking them by one of 
Simpson's lawyers and by a special court-appointed master supervising the 
execution of the search warrant. When the officer returned two weeks later with 
a warrant specifically authorizing him to seize the documents, Randa told him 
she had shredded them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito seemed taken aback by the disclosure, exclaiming, "Just when I think there 
are no more surprises!" But he agreed that Randa could be asked about the 
shredding and recommended that she have a lawyer with her when she appears. 
</P>
<P>
 She could be asked to testify as soon as Wednesday, when lawyers will return 
to the courtroom to argue the defense's motion to suppress evidence seized in 
various searches of Simpson's home, cars and office. 
</P>
<P>
 That issue also touches another volatile topic in the case, however. Defense 
attorneys maintain that prosecutors are improperly using the grand jury 
investigating Cowlings to conduct further investigation of Simpson, and they 
will argue later this week that any evidence gathered from Simpson's office 
should be excluded from his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could hurt both sides in different ways," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA 
law professor. "It allows the defense to strengthen their case that the grand 
jury investigating Al Cowlings is really being used to investigate O.J. 
Simpson. . . . At the same time, it raises the question of why this document 
was shredded. You don't normally end an argument about an issue like this by 
destroying evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Before ruling on the motion to dismiss the case, Ito heard more than two hours 
of arguments from lawyers on both sides. Simpson, who was in court Monday and 
spent much of the hearing taking notes or chatting with attorney Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr., has pleaded not guilty to the murders of Ronald Lyle Goldman and 
Nicole Brown Simpson. If convicted, he could face life in prison without 
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro argued that the prosecution had failed to present a coherent theory of 
the murders during the preliminary hearing, that certain aspects of the 
prosecution case do not square with each other and that sloppy investigative 
work has made it impossible for Simpson to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the Los Angeles Police Department detectives on the scene did not 
follow departmental-approved policy and did not notify the coroner for 10 hours 
after the bodies had been seized . . . we are forever excluded from knowing 
what the time of death was," Shapiro said. "We have been left in a position 
where the people have deprived us of the absolute right to put on any real 
defense to this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborating on arguments first aired during the preliminary hearing, Shapiro 
and Simpson lawyer Gerald F. Uelmen hammered Monday on a number of instances in 
which they maintain that police and other investigators slipped up. Uelmen, for 
instance, accused one of the LAPD detectives of lying five times in preparing 
an affidavit for a warrant to search Simpson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 That affidavit, Uelmen said, shed light on the detectives' motives during 
their initial search of Simpson's estate. Although detectives later said they 
had jumped the fence surrounding Simpson's property in part because they were 
concerned about other possible victims inside, the affidavit contains no 
reference to entering the property without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing that and other statements in the affidavit, Uelmen said it "gives a 
very different account than the account presented in the carefully orchestrated 
testimony that we heard at the preliminary hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark conceded that there were mistakes in the affidavit -- at several points, 
Detective Philip L. Vannatter refers to red spots as "human blood" when that 
determination was not made until after the warrant was obtained -- but she said 
the errors were harmless. Even if the errors were corrected, she said, it would 
not have affected a judge's willingness to issue the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark also took aim at the recurring defense contention that a single person 
could not have committed the killings. She said crime scene evidence in fact 
suggests that a single killer was responsible, and she maintained, as 
prosecutors have throughout, that the culprit was Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have blood drops accompanied by bloody shoe prints," she said. "You see 
only one set of shoe prints leaving that crime scene, not two, leading us to 
understand that . . . there can only be one perpetrator." 
</P>
<P>
 In their effort to persuade Ito to dismiss the case, Simpson's attorneys 
consistently have focused on what they say are flaws in the case against their 
client -- a theme they reiterated during Monday's hearing. Among other things, 
they said that whoever committed the killings would almost certainly have been 
covered in blood, since both victims were repeatedly slashed and stabbed with a 
knife and their bodies found lying in deep pools of their own blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence that Mr. Simpson had any blood on him," Shapiro said. 
"There is no evidence of any bloody clothing being found." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Shapiro maintained that it was absurd to believe that Simpson 
would have carefully discarded certain pieces of evidence, such as bloody 
clothing and the murder weapon, and then stupidly brought a bloody glove back 
to his own home and left it there. 
</P>
<P>
 "One would have to believe that somebody who was careful enough to get rid of 
all those items of evidence in a very short period of time would nevertheless 
leave one glove at the murder scene and deliberately bring home and leave on 
his own property a glove that could later be discovered in plain view by anyone 
who was walking on the property," Shapiro said. "These are questions that the 
prosecution must answer, your honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Those accusations prompted Clark to deliver a detailed description of the 
prosecution's version of the killings. Her account echoed the version told for 
months by sources close to the case, but it marked the first time that 
prosecutors have laid it out in such detail, and it highlighted the 
prosecution's theory that Simpson meticulously plotted the murder of his 
ex-wife and only killed Goldman because the young man came upon the scene to 
return a pair of glasses to Nicole Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder is a messy thing, your honor," Clark said. "There was only one 
intended target, and that was Nicole Brown. When Ron Goldman showed up, that 
was something the defendant didn't bargain for." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Clark, Goldman and Simpson fought. It was in that struggle that 
Simpson lost one glove, was cut and had his cap pulled off, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidence was . . . left at the scene because it could not be seen by the 
defendant in the heat of the moment," Clark argued. "It was dark, and in point 
of fact, we see that the ski cap and the glove are underneath a plant. Did he 
look for them? He probably did, but there was no time to root around that crime 
scene in order to find evidence. He had to get out and get out fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Those mistakes do not suggest that Simpson did not plan the crime or that he 
did not commit it, Clark added: "The fact that a defendant makes mistakes, 
leaving evidence behind that allows the police to apprehend him is not the 
surprise, because if he didn't, he would never be caught. . . . If mistakes are 
not made, criminals are not apprehended." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers also filed a motion Monday asking Ito to sanction 
prosecutors for failing to move more quickly on DNA tests that could prove 
crucial to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 According to that motion, the Maryland lab running the bulk of the tests has 
completed its work on at least five blood samples -- two taken from Simpson's 
home, two from the blood trail near the murder scene and one from Goldman's 
shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have said results from the tests completed so far suggest a match 
between the blood drops at the scene and Simpson's blood, while the blood on 
Goldman's shoe was not from Simpson but rather from the victims. The two drops 
taken from Simpson's home also appear to match his blood, but those samples are 
considered less relevant to the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, genetic fingerprint tests of two other drops found near the 
victims were inconclusive. Other DNA tests still may be performed on those 
items to determine whether those tests yield conclusive findings. 
</P>
<P>
 With jury selection scheduled to begin Monday, Ito still has not decided 
whether panelists will be fully sequestered for the duration of the trial, 
which some have estimated could last six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of contacting prospective jurors already is under way. About 500 
have returned questionnaires that inquire about their ability to serve on the 
case until at least February. The one-page questionnaires ask the jurors if a 
hardship would be presented if they were partially sequestered -- kept away 
from others during the day and allowed to go home at night -- or fully 
sequestered -- put up in a hotel for the duration of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution has asked Ito to fully sequester the jury once it is picked to 
keep it away from what is expected to be unprecedented media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense has opposed that proposal in a sealed motion. Experts have said 
that full sequestration might narrow the diversity of the jury, given that the 
only people who could serve would be those who could be away from their jobs 
and families for an extended period. In addition, according to experts, fully 
sequestered juries often lean toward the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the one-page hardship questionnaires, jurors will be asked to 
fill out extensive questionnaires intended to give Ito and the lawyers some 
indication of prospective jurors' suitability to be on the panel. That process 
may begin as early as next week.

COLUMN ONE; FOR BUSH, THE SONS ALSO RISE; JEB AND GEORGE W. ARE RUNNING TIGHT 
RACES FOR GOVERNOR. THEY TAKE A HARDER LINE THAN THEIR DAD ON THEIR 
CONSERVATIVE AGENDA AND CAMPAIGN STYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like most Republicans here, retired oil executive Clark Bissett has long 
admired former President George Bush, who used to hunt quail in the fields 
outside this tiny South Texas town. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Bush's eldest son, George W., brought his campaign for the Texas 
governorship to a farm bureau rally here last week, Bissett assessed him an 
improvement on the old man. "I find him to be a little more aggressive, a 
little more outspoken," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That description, in fact, fits both George W. Bush and his younger brother 
Jeb, who last week brushed aside his last challenger for the Republican 
gubernatorial nomination in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 More articulate and confrontational than their father, the brothers symbolize 
the tectonic generational drift to the right in the Republican Party. Although 
President Bush often seemed uncertain of his ideological compass, his sons are 
running confident campaigns sharpened on the cutting edge of conservative 
thought -- particularly the cluster of value issues centered on out-of-wedlock 
births, welfare and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In style and appearance, the brothers reflect traces of George and Barbara 
Bush, but in their language and agenda, the line of succession runs more 
through new-wave conservative social theorists like William J. Bennett and 
Charles Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 "This . . . blaming those of us who try to live decent lives for society's 
ills has got to end," says George W. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Jeb: "We have to dismantle the welfare state if we have any chance of 
solving our crime problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bushes are locked in difficult battles against older, moderate Democratic 
incumbents: Lawton Chiles in Florida and Ann Richards in Texas. With polls 
showing both races close, each could turn on the same question: In these 
increasingly conservative and Republican states, will voters put more weight on 
ideological affinity or on experience -- the card both Chiles and Richards are 
emphasizing? 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush brothers are running in a year that looks very good for Republicans, 
but they are also running against history: The children of presidents have 
rarely enjoyed much political success. James Roosevelt, the son of Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, was a landslide loser to Earl Warren in the 1950 California 
gubernatorial race. Robert A. Taft, the son of William Howard Taft, won 
election as a Republican senator from Ohio -- but three times was denied the 
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 As in many families, the Bush brothers are defined mostly by their contrasts 
-- as if Jeb, seven years younger at 41, filled in the spaces left by his 
exuberant, impetuous older brother. "George is aggressive, highly energetic, 
very quick -- quick witted, quick to make decisions," says their younger 
brother, Neil. "Jeb is very serious, always has been. When someone presents an 
issue, he will study it and study it and come to a conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in July, 1946, George W. is six weeks older than Bill Clinton. He spent 
his childhood in West Texas, then followed his father's path through Phillips 
Academy in Andover, Mass., and Yale. After college he comfortably drifted, 
living the high life in Houston and casting about for direction. He 
unexpectedly enrolled at Harvard Business School -- earning an MBA -- and then, 
just as unexpectedly, followed his father's example again and returned to West 
Texas to start his own oil exploration firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the 1980s, he rode the waves of the oil business with only modest 
success: On two occasions he was forced to find larger suitors into which to 
merge his struggling exploration firms -- transactions that Democrats now 
suggest offered inflated prices to rescue the then-vice president's son. One 
Richards radio ad charges "every business he's ever been involved with had to 
be bailed out by his daddy's friends." Bush emphatically denies that any of the 
deals reflected favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989 he organized a group of investors that bought the Texas Rangers and, 
although owning only a small fraction of the baseball team, was installed as 
managing partner. That position gave him, for the first time, an independent 
public identity. Now, on the campaign trail, George W. is asked as many 
questions about the team and the cancellation of the major league season as 
about his parents, and admirers sometimes present him with baseballs to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ellis Bush, Jeb, maneuvered out of his father's tracks more quickly. Born 
in 1953, he also went to Andover but detoured during his senior year when, 
during a class visit to Mexico, he met his future wife, Columba. After Jeb 
graduated from the University of Texas, they married and eventually set out for 
Miami, where Jeb went into business with a prominent Cuban American developer 
he met in his father's 1980 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeb accumulated his own fortune in the go-go Miami real estate market of the 
1980s but also exhibited some lapses in judgment that have opened him to 
charges of trading on the family name. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most questionable case, during the Ronald Reagan Administration, Jeb 
phoned officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services seeking a 
federal waiver that would have benefited a health management organization that 
he was representing in a real estate transaction. Later, the company collapsed 
amid charges of defrauding the government, and its president was indicted for 
bribing a union official. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, I didn't feel like I was doing business with a crook," Jeb later 
told the Miami Herald. "Unfortunately, I didn't give it a whole lot of 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
 While building their fortunes, both brothers circled around the political 
world for years before stepping into the center ring. George W. actually ran 
once before, losing a bid for a West Texas congressional seat in 1978. Jeb 
served briefly as Florida's appointed secretary of commerce and burrowed into 
Florida politics as chairman of the Republican Party in populous and tumultuous 
Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
 As candidates they bookend their father: one folksier and yet more focused, 
the other more cerebral and polished. 
</P>
<P>
 George W. is the outgoing Texan with an oversized manner, a knack for 
instantly establishing intimacy and a quick, self-deprecating wit. While the 
former President was lanky and vaguely entropic, his eldest son is physically 
and emotionally coiled, with a flashing temper that as a candidate he's mostly 
kept holstered. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his father, George W. is attentive to the details of politics: Settling 
into his six-seat campaign plane after an event, he immediately jotted off a 
stack of thank-you notes. At an early morning press conference in Brownsville, 
he deftly cajoled a hesitant local police chief to move just a few steps closer 
-- into the frame of the television cameras covering the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The details of public policy appear to move him less. George W. has put 
forward a wide-ranging agenda but doesn't pretend that he stays up late at 
night scouring scholarly journals for ways to improve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a few hours off before a Houston fund-raiser last week, he 
groaned like a student handed an unexpected homework assignment when an aide 
told him they had to spend part of the afternoon going over questionnaires from 
interest groups seeking his views on specific issues. When pressed, he can 
sometimes be hesitant and vague trying to explain the implications of proposals 
in his position papers on issues like welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeb is more conversant with the details of policy and the trends in 
conservative thought. Devising his welfare plan, he consulted Wisconsin Gov. 
Tommy G. Thompson and sociologist Charles Murray -- two gurus for the GOP on 
social policy. Touring a securities firm in Tampa last week, he answered a 
question about educational vouchers by touting an experimental program in 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to his brother, Jeb cuts a more urban, contemporary figure. He shakes 
hands easily, but doesn't slap backs as often. George W. has been known to chew 
tobacco while drinking coffee; at the securities firm, Jeb cited the noted 
political philosopher Mick Jagger to explain his view of the services 
government should provide. ("You can't always get what you want. But . . . you 
get what you need.") 
</P>
<P>
 "I quote the Rolling Stones and play golf," Jeb told one young questioner at a 
campaign stop last week. "I'm not the hunter." He was trying to explain his 
cultural differences with Chiles; but he could as easily been talking about his 
brother -- notwithstanding the problems George W. ran into for mistakenly 
shooting a protected killdeer on the first day of dove hunting season this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their personal differences, the brothers are running on similar 
agendas -- so much so that comparisons are a sore subject with them. One close 
family friend says Jeb earlier this year called his older brother to complain 
he was stealing his lines. But Jeb denies the conversation occurred. "Any 
challenger, any governor, running from the conservative perspective . . . is 
talking about these things," he insists. 
</P>
<P>
 At the margins, Jeb's campaign, in fact, has a harder ideological edge. Both 
want to cut off aid to welfare recipients after two years on the rolls -- 
without offering the public service jobs President Clinton would provide under 
his time-limit plan; but Jeb also proposes a tougher version than his brother 
of the "family cap" that would deny additional benefits to women who have 
children while on the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Both want to lengthen the sentences prisoners serve, but Jeb supports a crash 
prison construction program that would allow Florida to keep criminals in jail 
for at least 85% of their sentenced time. 
</P>
<P>
 Both want to slash central school bureaucracies and radically devolve power to 
local school boards, but Jeb is more enthusiastic than his brother about 
vouchers that would provide public funds to help parents send their children to 
private schools. And unlike George W., Jeb has proposed a constitutional 
amendment that would require voter approval for all state tax increases -- an 
idea conservatives are aggressively pushing around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the differences between the brothers are minor compared to their 
distance from their father's perspective -- especially in their common efforts 
to link crime to family breakdown and the growth of what Jeb calls a 
welfare-dependent "permanent underclass." 
</P>
<P>
 With their proposals for cutting off aid to welfare recipients after two 
years, both are proposing social experiments more radical -- and polarizing -- 
than their father ever risked as President. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, you're saying poverty is a crime; we're going to give you a 
suspended sentence for two years and then you're in for life," says Jack 
Levine, executive director of the Florida Center for Children and Youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with these strikingly similar political challenges -- the most recent 
public polling in both states has shown the races a virtual dead heat -- the 
two veteran Democrats facing the Bush brothers are responding with markedly 
divergent strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Gov. Richards, who remains personally popular, so far has generally 
tried to avoid directly debating Bush's proposals. Instead she has emphasized 
her own accomplishments -- trumpeting the state's job growth, budget surplus 
and an across-the-board reduction in crime through the first half of 1994. 
She's been even more intent on attempting to paint Bush as inexperienced and 
unqualified: To underline the point, the tart-tongued governor has at times 
referred to the younger Bush as "shrub." 
</P>
<P>
 In Florida, the race hasn't sharpened as much as in Texas, because the GOP 
primary wasn't held until Sept. 8. Bush didn't win the nomination outright 
until early last week, when Secretary of State Jim Smith, who finished a 
distant second in the primary, dropped out of a potential runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Richards, Gov. Chiles is questioning his opponent's qualifications and 
touting his own experience. But, unlike Richards, Chiles' campaign is signaling 
an intent to wage ideological combat with Jeb Bush, portraying him as an 
extremist out of touch with the state on issues like his opposition to legal 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The former President looms over both contests. Both brothers have benefited 
enormously from the fund-raising networks their father established through his 
three-decade career in Texas and national politics. The Austin 
American-Statesman recently calculated that 1,400 people had contributed to 
both campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Their father's political legacy is cloudier. It has given both brothers a pool 
of partisans instantly attracted to them. But the famous name leaves them open 
to suspicions that they have enjoyed a privileged rise through life -- which 
could help Democratic efforts to paint their stern ideas on welfare and crime 
as unfeeling and insular. Partly as a result, both brothers have deployed their 
father only sparingly, and mostly to raise money -- as he did in a series of 
fund-raisers across Florida for Jeb last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who defeated the elder Bush could also cast a long shadow over these 
races. In Florida, Bill Clinton has emerged as a bit of improbable inspiration: 
Jeb Bush is echoing some of the themes the President employed against his 
father in 1992, presenting himself as the candidate of change and promising to 
stand up for middle-class voters "playing by the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly, the President is a target: Clinton isn't popular in either state 
-- although his firm response to the Cuban exodus has improved his standing in 
Florida somewhat -- and both Bushes are trying to lash their opponents to his 
sinking ship. "Bill Clinton has been bad for Texas and bad for America, and 
doesn't it make sense to have a governor who understands that?" George W. 
declared last week at a Houston fund-raiser hosted by his father's secretary of 
state, James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
 Both brothers are sensitive to any suggestions that they are running to 
rehabilitate the family name. 
</P>
<P>
 But the former President seems to understand the symbolic implications of 
these elections, coming just two years after voters overwhelmingly turned him 
out of the White House: At a fund-raising breakfast for Jeb in Tampa last 
Friday, he looked down from the podium at his son and said in a suddenly 
cracking voice: "No one likes not to finish what they started out to do. But 
the finish is sitting here . . . at my right hand."

U.S. NOT SURE HOW HAITI DEAL WILL WORK; STRATEGY: DETAILED PLANNING DIDN'T 
ENVISION ARMY REMAINING INTACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the clear light of a morning after, Clinton Administration officials took a 
second look Monday at their hastily negotiated deal with Haiti's ruling 
generals, contemplated its flaws -- and decided that they could live with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledged that the pact wasn't perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 They said its unexpected outcome -- a peaceful entry for 15,000 U.S. troops, 
but with the brutal military regime still in place -- threw their detailed 
plans for Haiti into confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not have a plan specifically for this contingency," confessed an 
official who was at President Clinton's side in the Oval Office during the 
weekend-long negotiations. "We don't know exactly how this is going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Even former President Jimmy Carter, who ground out the agreement in more than 
20 hours of negotiations over two wearying days, said the one-page pact might 
have some weak spots. "I don't want it to be examined in the most minute detail 
by lawyers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What is worrying some American officials and critics outside the 
Administration, however, isn't a matter of technical glitches but of where the 
strange, hybrid result of the weekend's negotiations may lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the deal's potential problems: It contains no requirement that Haiti's 
top two military rulers, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, 
leave the country -- merely that they retire by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras has said he wants to stay in Haiti and run for president, though some 
of his friends in Port-au-Prince said Monday they expect him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact includes no provision for disarming or demobilizing most of Haiti's 
armed forces, as U.S. policy has sought. Indeed, it doesn't formally bind other 
officers and their units to the leadership's commitments, "so there might very 
well be violations," Carter noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important for Haiti's future, the agreement implies that the existing 
structure of Haiti's armed forces, long the country's main instrument of 
repression, should be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have preserved the Haitian armed forces at the moment," acknowledged Gen. 
Colin L. Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of 
the U.S. negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 And, on the ground, the pragmatic demands of moving 15,000 troops peacefully 
into Haiti already seem to have driven the American expeditionary force, 
willingly or not, into the arms of Cedras and his high command. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, the U.S. commander in Haiti, told reporters in 
Port-au-Prince that he had found Cedras highly cooperative and would even rely 
on the Haitian army to help maintain order. Cedras "will use his forces in some 
cases to make sure that there is no violence, if you will, displayed either 
against his own forces or against ours," Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
 That prospect drew anguished complaints from U.S. supporters of exiled Haitian 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- and even from Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.), who is not an Aristide admirer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said he didn't understand why Cedras was "allowed to stick around until 
the 15th of October, maybe stay in the country and maybe run for president next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) said the Administration had "folded." 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we were going to go in on the side of the Haitian people," he said. 
"Now, we're going in on the side of the Haitian military." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, said he considered the U.S.-Haitian military cooperation one of 
several "imperfections" in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Robinson, head of TransAfrica, an African American lobbying group, 
said the arrangement was "impractical folly," comparing it to allowing Nazi war 
criminals to remain in positions of power at the end of World War II. "This 
will be a very combustible situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 George Vickers, head of the Washington Office on Latin America, a liberal 
lobbying group, complained: "The transition process is in the hands of the 
Haitian military." As a result, he said, even if Aristide returns to Haiti next 
month, it could "only represent a democratic facade without eliminating the 
structures responsible for the coup." 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the talks also left U.S. officials scrambling to figure out 
what their forces on the ground should do, and when. 
</P>
<P>
 They said their earlier plans had always assumed that the command structure of 
the Haitian armed forces would collapse as a result of a U.S. invasion or 
because its leaders would flee into exile. 
</P>
<P>
 With Cedras and his colleagues still in place, officials were unable to say 
when or how they would begin the most important parts of their mission: 
disarming the paramilitary thugs who have terrorized Haiti's poor, reorganizing 
the police force and, eventually, remaking the army. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked when multinational troops intended to retrain the police will arrive, 
for example, State Department spokesman Michael McCurry could only reply: "That 
is an operational detail." 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior official acknowledged: "I don't know, and nobody knows." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday night, immediately after Clinton announced the Haitian deal, senior 
officials from half a dozen government agencies held a hastily convened 
telephone meeting to begin revamping their plans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar meetings were still under way, almost nonstop, on Monday.

 LIVING HISTORY: Eighth-graders at Cerro Villa Middle School in Villa Park soon 
will be using high-tech video cameras, computer compact discs, graphics and 
animation equipment to create "multimedia collages" depicting historical 
events. The project, called History Alive!, was proposed by teacher Judith 
Crum, who has won a $39,500 grant to launch it. . . . Crum is one of five 
California teachers selected this year to win a Christa McAuliffe Fellowship, 
named for the teacher-astronaut who died in the 1986 Challenger explosion.

 NOVEL FRIENDS: Author Nina Vida of Huntington Beach says her close friendships 
with several Vietnamese families led her to write "Goodbye, Saigon," a new 
novel about life in Little Saigon (E1). . . . Her close ties gave her an 
insight seldom afforded an outsider. "This opportunity does not arise because 
it's a very closed society in which the family is everything," she says. 
"Friends are friends only when they become 'family.' "

 SOUVENIRS: Orange County Superior Court jurors keep walking away with jury 
badges, so the court switched from plastic badges costing 19 cents apiece to 
the paper kind costing 12 cents each. A sign in the jury room warns of the 
costs associated with replacing badges for 1,900 jurors each week. "I think 
people just forget they have it on," said Assistant Executive Court Officer Pat 
Hill. . . . "Unless they want it to remind them of how much they hated the 
experience," she joked.

 It was Johnny Pagnini's greatest race. 
</P>
<P>
 At the wheel of his newly purchased 1966 Corvette, the Costa Mesa motorcycle 
buff and sometime-racer helped police capture two suspected kidnapers Sunday 
night after a zigzagging high-speed freeway chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagnini, who manages a Santa Ana motorcycle shop, said he gave chase after 
spotting a woman struggling with a man in the back seat of a car on the Costa 
Mesa Freeway in Santa Ana. The pursuit ended about 30 miles later in Long Beach 
after the suspects apparently disabled their car when they rammed his $40,000 
sports car, which was still uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagnini said that at one point he feared the woman was being pushed out an 
open car door at top speed, then worried he might be shot for keeping up the 
chase, even after the pair stopped to let the woman go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about that stuff -- and my kids," he said Monday. "It was just 
something I felt I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricardo B. Ramirez, 18, and Mario Garay, 21, both from Santa Ana, were 
arrested on suspicion of kidnaping and attempting to rape the woman, a Tustin 
resident who met the pair recently, Tustin police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who was not identified, was treated for minor injuries, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She and a female friend rode with the two men to a convenience store on 
McFadden Street in Tustin after 8 p.m., police said. While the friend was in 
the store, the suspects drove off with the victim, police said. They made their 
way to the Costa Mesa Freeway and Ramirez tried to sexually assault her in the 
car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagnini, 38, and his friend Cindy Jarvis pulled onto the freeway in his 
Corvette about the same time. He said he spotted the suspects' car, an 
Oldsmobile, and saw the woman fighting with a man in the back seat. Jarvis 
thought the two were playing until Pagnini pulled close behind and, in the 
light of his headlamps, saw the woman's terrified expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "The look in the girl's face is one I will never, ever forget -- the fright," 
he said. "Her face was against the back window and I could see the guy swinging 
at her." 
</P>
<P>
 The car then sped away, Pagnini said, but he followed it north on the San 
Diego Freeway. He said the woman fought furiously. A rear door flapped open and 
her leg flew out. Pagnini thought for a moment she was about to be pitched out 
into traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the suspects' car pulled over near the Brookhurst Street exit and the 
woman got out. Pagnini dropped off Jarvis, who stayed with the victim until 
police arrived, and took up the chase again. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cars hit speeds of about 100 m.p.h., Pagnini said. They weaved in and 
out of traffic, briefly skittered onto surface streets and then ended up on the 
Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 When he inadvertently got ahead of the suspects' car, it rammed his Corvette, 
but was apparently disabled in the collision. As the suspects' car stalled on 
an off-ramp, another motorist summoned police from a pay phone and the men were 
arrested without incident, said Tustin Police Sgt. Mike Pettifer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were grateful for the happy ending, but advised would-be good 
Samaritans simply to take down a license plate number and call police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out OK -- the suspects were taken into custody," said Pettifer. 
"Because it turned out OK, I guess the guy's a hero. But I certainly don't 
encourage people taking that much action."

2 SAN DIEGO SUSPECTS IN CARDINAL'S SLAYING ORDERED EXTRADITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge ruled Monday that two San Diego street gang members accused of 
working as hired guns for a Mexican drug cartel should be extradited to Mexico 
to stand trial for the slaying last year of the Roman Catholic cardinal of 
Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
 The two suspects belong to the 30th Street gang, which became embroiled in one 
of the most notorious recent crimes in Mexico: a shootout at the Guadalajara 
airport in May, 1993, that killed Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo and six 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 young gang members entered into an unprecedented cross-border 
alliance with the Arellano drug cartel of Tijuana, working as bodyguards and 
assassins in a war for control of the northwest Mexican border area, according 
to law enforcement officials in both countries. Eight gang members have been 
arrested, and one died last year in a Guadalajara prison under mysterious 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three cartel kingpins, the Arellano brothers of Tijuana, have evaded 
capture with the aid of corrupt law enforcement allies. Church officials and 
other critics have questioned the government's assertion that the gunmen 
accidentally killed the cardinal -- who was shot 14 times at point-blank range 
-- when his chauffeured car drove into a shootout between rival gangsters. The 
Arellanos gunmen escaped on a Tijuana-bound commercial flight that was held for 
them by airport authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Leo S. Pappas found evidence that 
Jesus (Cougar) Zamora Salas, 21, and Carlos Enrique (Tarzan) Garcia, 24, were 
part of an assassination squad sent to Guadalajara to kill a rival cartel boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence against the respondents is probable, at the very least, that 
they were involved in the planning if not the actual exchange of gunfire at the 
Guadalajara airport," Pappas wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge rejected defense claims that the case presented by U.S. prosecutors 
on behalf of Mexican authorities was weak because most of the evidence came 
from the confessions of four suspects who were allegedly tortured by Mexican 
police. Defense lawyers also argued that their clients face death if they are 
sent south of the border, but prosecutors said human rights questions are 
irrelevant in the narrowly focused extradition hearing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora and Garcia are U.S. citizens who were born in Mexico. Barring a 
successful petition to stay the judge's order, their extraditions could take 
place within days, Assistant U.S. Atty. John Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents in Southern California are still hunting for two Arellanos 
lieutenants who allegedly recruited the assassination squad -- veteran 30th 
Street gang members Alfredo (Popeye) Araujo and David Barron Corona.

S.F. POLICE LAB WORKER ACCUSED OF DRUG TESTING FRAUD; LAW ENFORCEMENT: 
TECHNICIAN WAS TARGETED BY INTERNAL STING AFTER REPORTS THAT EVIDENCE SAMPLES 
WERE NOT PROPERLY EXAMINED. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SAY MANY CONVICTIONS MAY BE 
AFFECTED.

<P>
 It was a normal day's work for police laboratory technician Allison Lancaster: 
A steady stream of officers brought in suspected narcotics seized from drug 
users for her to test. 
</P>
<P>
 What she didn't know was that she was the target of a sting by her own 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Tipped that drug samples were not being tested properly, detectives gave her 
bags of harmless powder labeled as narcotics. Lancaster fell for the trap, 
authorities said, allegedly skipping required tests and identifying the planted 
samples as opiates and cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports of allegedly fraudulent testing at the San Francisco Police 
Department's laboratory have outraged defense attorneys and called into 
question as many as 1,000 drug convictions that relied on Lancaster's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The integrity of our department has been compromised and we're going to 
address it," said San Francisco Police Chief Tony Ribera. "Any time you have 
the human factor involved, there are going to be times when the public trust is 
violated." 
</P>
<P>
 To some defense attorneys, the San Francisco case is just the latest in a 
string of scandals involving fraudulent tests by police departments across the 
country -- including the use of falsified blood and fingerprint evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a widespread and endemic problem in our criminal justice system and it's 
not a surprise to me that you'd find it in San Francisco," said Los Angeles 
lawyer Barry Tarlow. "Traditionally, jurors have been taught that fingerprints 
don't lie. However, liars do take fingerprints." 
</P>
<P>
 In West Virginia, a police chemist whose lab tests helped convict hundreds of 
criminal defendants in two states over 13 years was charged last month with 
perjury and tampering with evidence. More than 70 cases are under review and 
two men, one convicted of murder and the other of rape, have been released. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, a state trooper pleaded guilty to perjury two years ago for 
faking fingerprint evidence in four high-profile cases near Ithaca. His 
admission called into question convictions in dozens of other cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department's lab had its own problems in 1989 when 
ballistics tests incorrectly identified the gun of Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Deputy Rickey Ross as the weapon that killed three prostitutes. Ross was later 
cleared and prosecutors began using their own experts to verify the lab's 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, defense lawyers said the bogus drug testing is certain to 
result in a flock of appeals from inmates seeking to have their convictions 
overturned. Some are expected to file civil rights lawsuits seeking damages 
from the city for false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster, a five-year lab employee, has been suspended from her job without 
pay and is under criminal investigation by the department. Charges could 
include falsely certifying evidence in court, an offense similar to perjury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department and the office of Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith have begun 
poring through years of records to determine what cases Lancaster worked on. 
Because most evidence is destroyed six months after trial, most of the 
confiscated substances cannot be retested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We estimate that it would be roughly 1,000 cases that we filed," Smith said. 
"I don't know how many will ultimately be affected. We are moving rapidly to 
make sure they are identified." 
</P>
<P>
 The testing controversy follows on the heels of a series of high-profile 
scandals in the San Francisco Police Department, including alleged sexual 
harassment by Chief Ribera, the case of an officer who pleaded no contest to 
illegally accessing computer records on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League 
and the firing of former Chief Richard Hongisto for ordering officers to steal 
critical newspapers from street racks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ribera, seeking to prevent further erosion of the department's 
credibility, said he moved quickly to investigate the allegations against 
Lancaster by a co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mere fact that it was called to our attention by somebody who works in 
the process shows it is certainly not accepted conduct," Ribera said. "I don't 
think anyone on this Police Department wants to send innocent people to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 At the police lab, Lancaster handled thousands of pieces of evidence a year 
but specialized primarily in blood work, conducting drug tests when there was 
an overflow or when she worked weekends -- as she did at the time of the sting 
earlier this month. Blood test evidence is kept longer and her work on those 
cases has not been called into question. 
</P>
<P>
 During her five years with the lab, she was responsible for about 1,000 drug 
tests that led to convictions. In most of them, the defendants pleaded guilty. 
But San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Brown said it is unlikely most would 
have pleaded guilty without the police lab's finding that they possessed 
narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pleaded guilty on the basis of the statement by the crime lab that the 
substance tested positively," Brown said. "If that has been secured by 
intentional wrongdoing, that seriously affects the plea of guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 How each of the 1,000 cases is resolved will depend in part on what other 
evidence prosecutors can muster. Smith may attempt to uphold some convictions 
by presenting the arresting officers as scientific experts on the 
identification of narcotics. He may also argue that guilty pleas should stand 
because the defendants knew they possessed or were selling illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, Ribera said, drug users from the suburbs come to San Francisco 
and get taken in by con artists who sell them substances such as powdered milk 
balls instead of rock cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal to sell such things but not to possess a harmless substance and 
believe it is illegal. In some cases the lab clears suspects if it finds a 
substance is not illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dope testing is the crucial piece of evidence," Brown said. "The person 
could think he has dope and the police could think he has dope. But if it isn't 
dope, the case falls apart."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; WILSON REJECTS PROPOSED TV DEBATE FORMAT; THE 
OCT. 16 EVENT IS NOW IN DOUBT. MANAGER OF THE HOST STATION SAYS THE GOVERNOR'S 
DEMANDS INCREASED AFTER A POLL SHOWED HIM WITH A LEAD OVER BROWN. 
</P>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has rejected a proposed format for an Oct. 16 debate with 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, effectively canceling the only scheduled 
gubernatorial forum and fueling accusations that Wilson's campaign wants to 
avoid debates altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations with the hosts of the October event, the California Broadcasters 
Assn. and KGO-TV in San Francisco, broke down late last week when Wilson's 
representatives insisted upon choosing which political reporters would ask 
questions and sought to exclude questions from the public. The stalemate ended 
nine weeks of discussions and on Monday, some participants questioned whether 
Wilson had negotiated in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line of this is: Do you want to have a debate? Or are you ahead in 
the polls and you would just as soon have as limited exposure as possible?" 
said Jim Topping, KGO-TV's general manager, who said the format talks grew more 
complicated after a Los Angeles Times poll of likely voters found Wilson ahead 
by 9 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly, there's an array of problems. . . . The intransigence over smaller 
elements of the format have been directly proportional to the increase in 
(Wilson's) ratings," Topping said. "It's absurd. He just wants to duck it." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown herself sent Wilson a letter Monday, reaffirming her commitment to 
participate in as many as five statewide televised debates and questioning the 
sincerity of Wilson's claim that he is eager to face her. Wilson's aides have 
repeatedly said they will not discuss multiple debates until the first debate 
has been nailed down. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at a news conference at the Los Angeles school her children once 
attended, Brown blistered Wilson again. "What is Pete Wilson hiding from? He's 
hiding from his record," said Brown, who noted that the broadcasters and KGO-TV 
had offered several formats designed to address Wilson's concerns, but would 
not allow him to exclude public participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson is afraid to answer your questions about your family's economic 
future, your kids' schools and your family's safety," said Brown, who 
reiterated her pledge to accept any format that is proposed by a legitimate 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign spokesman, countered that Wilson wants political 
reporters to be the sole questioners not because he fears the public, but 
because he believes the public deserves a vigorous, hard-hitting exchange of 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the format ought to have as few distractions as possible and 
maximize the opportunity for the reporters involved to hold the candidates 
accountable for the accuracy of their answers," said Schnur, who contended that 
questions from television viewers -- even when transcribed and asked by 
reporters, as the broadcasters suggested -- would be distracting. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how well-informed, there's no way that (viewers) can have as much 
information" as reporters, Schnur said. "They don't spend all day every day 
covering the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Topping, the KGO executive, greeted this explanation with sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me see if I understand this," he said. "They want a hard-hitting debate, 
so they want to pick the questioners? Oh, I understand. Sure. . . . In 33 years 
(as a journalist) I've done about 75 debates at the presidential, the U.S. 
Senate and the gubernatorial level. And I have never prior to this seen the 
list of requests presented by the Wilson camp. It's overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur said he understood that the broadcasters were frustrated, but added 
that the candidates -- not the hosts -- should have the last word on debate 
format. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand they want to make this as exciting and telegenic as possible. . 
. . But this isn't about ratings," Schnur said, adding that since Brown has 
agreed to accept any format, the broadcasters could have ended the negotiations 
by simply accepting Wilson's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sponsor is the one holding out. The logical step to take at that point is 
to find another sponsor. And there are plenty of TV stations around California 
that have indicated an interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur said the campaign is talking to KCAL-TV Channel 9 in Los Angeles, which 
has proposed a format similar to what Wilson has sought. KFMB-TV in San Diego 
and KVIE-TV, the PBS station in Sacramento, are also interested, Schnur said, 
and the Wilson campaign is confident that at least one statewide debate will 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in active conversation with several possible hosts," he said. "There's 
no reason that we can't work out multiple debates." Political Scorecard 
</P>
<P>
 49 days to go before Californians go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Monday: State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, appearing at the Los 
Angeles elementary school that her children once attended, blasted Gov. Pete 
Wilson's record on education and said he was afraid to debate her. Wilson 
signed legislation in Sacramento, while the San Francisco Giants' Barry Bonds 
helped First Lady Gayle Wilson stuff envelopes at campaign headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Brown travels around the state this week speaking about 
education and the economy and continuing to press Wilson on his record. Wilson 
plans to remain in Sacramento attending to gubernatorial business. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Monday: U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike Huffington 
were in Washington, where Congress has reconvened. Both candidates were 
expected to be there most of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: With her husband in the nation's capital, Arianna Huffington 
was planning to represent his campaign in Orange County, Sacramento and San 
Francisco this week. Feinstein, meanwhile, is attending fund-raising events in 
Washington.

 A LIGHTER NOTE 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many parties thrown at the state Republican Party convention over 
the weekend, "Name That Brown" night stood out. Invitations to the two-hour 
poolside event included this series of mock "TV Guide" listings poking fun at 
Democrat Kathleen Brown's candidacy: "The Wheel of Misfortune," "The Price 
Isn't Right," "Let's Make Any Deal" and "California in Jeopardy."

DESERT PROTECTION ACT IMPERILED; POLITICS: A GOP SENATOR'S AMENDMENT STALLS 
RESOLUTION OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HOUSE AND SENATE VERSIONS. FEINSTEIN, A CHIEF 
SPONSOR, IS COUNTING ON PASSAGE TO TRUMPET IN REELECTION DRIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The California Desert Protection Act, once thought to be a sure thing after 
passage in both houses of Congress, is in peril, a victim of political 
infighting and an end-of-session legislative traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
 One of many bills awaiting final action before Congress adjourns in October, 
the desert legislation is hung up in the Senate, where its chief sponsor, Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), has been forced to scramble for votes to overcome 
delaying tactics orchestrated by Republican foes of the massive land-use 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bill's opponents strenuously object to the legislation on 
philosophical grounds, political considerations also play a major role. 
Feinstein has been counting on a desert bill victory to trumpet in her 
difficult reelection contest with Mike Huffington, a freshman House member from 
Santa Barbara whose massive campaign spending has turned the race into a 
nail-biter. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans would love to deny her that legislative success. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this bill is defeated, it would be due to sheer, rank, ribald politics," 
Feinstein said Monday. "But they wouldn't be denying me, they would be denying 
California. I already got it through the Senate, and nobody has ever done that 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 But in order to break the latest deadlock, Feinstein probably will have to 
make a significant compromise over the status of the East Mojave Scenic Area, 
making it a preserve and not a national park as called for in the Senate 
version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate approved the bill in April and the House passed a different version 
in late July. Supporters hoped it would soon go to a House-Senate conference 
committee to iron out differences. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wyoming Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop blocked the route to conference and 
tacked on a costly amendment. Wallop wants to increase federal payments that 
cities and counties receive in lieu of taxes on federal property within their 
borders. Since Wallop's initial action, the bill has been "on a revolving 
Republican hold," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was somewhat surprised by the stalling tactics, but perhaps nothing should 
surprise me around here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This week Feinstein is calling senators to line up the 60 votes needed to 
overcome opponents' procedural hurdles. In April, the bill passed the Senate, 
69 to 29, with 16 Republicans voting in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am hopeful we can gather those votes," said Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 While clinging to the hope that last-minute bargaining will salvage the bill, 
environmentalists fear that eight years' work on Capitol Hill might go for 
naught. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's definitely a dark cloud hanging over the bill, but the silver lining 
is that (supporters and opponents) are still talking," said Norbert Riedy, 
California representative for the Wilderness Society. "If nothing were going 
on, that would be much worse. Often bills Ping-Pong between the two Houses near 
the end of the session." 
</P>
<P>
 The key environmental difference between the two versions is the status of the 
East Mojave National Scenic Area -- the onetime centerpiece of the bill. The 
Senate upgraded the land to national park status, which would forbid hunting. 
The House, bowing to intense pressure from the National Rifle Assn., made the 
land a preserve where hunting could continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond political machinations, desert-bill supporters are simply running out 
of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress is scheduled to adjourn in three to four weeks and must complete work 
on nearly a dozen spending bills. If the Senate does not complete work on the 
desert legislation, time will expire on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 8 million acres of land would be preserved under the legislation. In 
the House and Senate versions, the Death Valley and Joshua Tree national 
monuments would become national parks and their lands would be expanded. 
Millions of acres of desert territory would be off-limits to mining and 
motorized recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert bill would become the largest land conservation law since the 1980 
Alaska Lands Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the desert bill would add more lands to the National Park 
System, which is already cutting back on visitor center hours, unable to 
provide adequate housing for rangers and scheduled to lose 3,700 positions over 
the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 They also criticize the bill's environmentalist supporters as zealots who do 
not live in the desert but want to protect it, ignoring the needs of desert 
inhabitants.

<P>
 Conservative Prime Minister Carl Bildt resigned Monday, a day after voters 
brought back the Social Democrats to guide the country out of its economic 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 After a campaign dominated by economic issues, the Social Democrats captured 
45.6% of the vote Sunday, according to late returns. 
</P>
<P>
 That's enough to return Ingvar Carlsson to the prime minister's post three 
years after he was ousted by a conservative coalition. His Social Democratic 
Party won 162 seats, 13 short of a majority in the 349-seat Parliament. Bildt's 
conservative coalition won 147 seats. Carlsson has been asked to try to form a 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Democrats have held power for most of the past 60 years. Their free 
spending built up Sweden's welfare state after World War II. But they 
campaigned like fiscal conservatives, promising fiscal control and limited cuts 
in public spending.

SERBS DRIVING MUSLIMS FROM NORTHERN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs herded hundreds more Muslims across the front lines Monday, and 
U.N. officials said few non-Serbs were left in Serb-held areas in the 
northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were killed during the transfer and many others required urgent 
medical treatment when they arrived, according to Red Cross officials at the 
crossing point. One man died when he stepped on a mine while crossing into 
government territory, officials of Bosnia's Muslim-dominated government and 
refugees said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exodus from the towns of Bijeljina and Janja showed the determination of 
ethnic Serb nationalists to force out the last few thousand non-Serbs who have 
endured more than two years of harassment and deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they haven't completely removed all the non-Serbs, they have certainly got 
their numbers down to next to nothing," said Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the 
Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30,000 Slavic Muslims lived in the Bijeljina region before ethnic Serbs 
went to war in April, 1992, following a vote by majority Muslims and Croats for 
Bosnia to secede from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 3,800 people were sent over the front line to government territory 
Sunday and Monday. And 1,000 more are expected soon, Red Cross spokesman Lisa 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the latest refugees, like previous groups forced out since mid-July, 
had to pay the Serbs a transportation fee for being driven to the front and 
were robbed of their money and other valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 The expulsions have come as Bosnian Serbs defy pressure from the international 
community and their former patrons in Yugoslavia to accept a peace plan that 
would leave them in control of 49% of Bosnia. They currently hold 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, was quieter Monday after the heaviest fighting 
in months flared late Sunday. Two people were killed and 18 wounded.

CHOLERA EPIDEMIC IN RUSSIA SPREADS TO CRIMEA; 4 DEAD; HEALTH: MORE CASES ARE 
EXPECTED. INFECTIOUS DISEASES FLOURISHING IN FORMER U.S.S.R. AS LIVING 
STANDARDS FALL. 
</P>

<P>
 The cholera epidemic that has been ravaging southern Russia has spread to 
Crimea, killing four people and infecting 58 others, public health officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The outbreak in Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula that is an autonomous region 
within Ukraine, came just as Russian public health authorities were declaring 
that the epidemic that killed 15 people in Dagestan and infected at least 1,000 
others was finally subsiding. "We thought it was under control, and suddenly 
again you have an outbreak," said Loreta Colatosti of the World Health 
Organization in Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimean public health chief Boris Lezhentsev told the Itar-Tass news agency 
that he expects the epidemic to worsen because of an acute water shortage, a 
heat wave and generally poor sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimea, a subtropical vacation spot, has suffered a sharp economic decline and 
chronic political instability over the past three years as the ethnic Russian 
population has attempted to separate from Ukraine and rejoin Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Crimean capital of Simferopol, markets were shut Monday, streets were 
cleaned and hospital beds were being readied, Itar-Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Infectious diseases of all sorts have flourished in the former Soviet Union as 
living standards here have declined. The number of diphtheria cases jumped this 
year in nearly all of the former Soviet republics, except Estonia, which 
reported no incidents, WHO reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia reported 15,229 diphtheria cases in 1993, but registered 14,334 cases 
in the first seven months of 1994, the data show. 
</P>
<P>
 Azerbaijan has had a tenfold increase in measles, Uzbekistan suffered an 
outbreak of polio and typhoid fever has reappeared in Russia. Tuberculosis and 
syphilis are widespread, and the incidence of such children's diseases as 
whooping cough and German measles has increased sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer also brought outbreaks of anthrax from infected cattle, fatal 
salmonella poisoning from contaminated food and leptospirosis from 
rodent-contaminated meat, according to Russian news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The cholera epidemic is blamed on the new freedom to travel and contract the 
disease abroad, as well as inadequate treatment of water and sewage that helps 
spread the bacteria at home. "Cholera is a disease of poverty," said Dr. Maria 
Neira of WHO in Geneva. "If you don't have hygienic conditions and minimal 
public health standards, the vibrio (bacteria) can spread very quickly. . . . 
In the former Soviet Union, the health infrastructure is now broken." 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, cholera has struck in Russia, Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus. Four 
deaths have been reported in the breakaway southern Russian republic of 
Chechnya, though there is no official confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has no problem treating cholera patients once they are hospitalized, 
and even in underdeveloped Dagestan there is no shortage of medicine, said 
Mikhail I. Narkeyevich of the Russian Ministry of Health. The last death in 
Dagestan occurred nearly a month ago, and few new cases are appearing, raising 
hopes that the epidemic there is at last under control, he said.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; FIRST STEPS INTO HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At dawn Monday, U.S. helicopters began the huge task of moving personnel and 
supplies into Haiti. Here is a look at the operation's initial steps: MONDAY'S 
MISSION 
</P>
<P>
 1. Two U.S. warships and a Coast Guard cutter glide into Port-au-Prince and 
secure the main harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 2. At 9:30 a.m. EDT, Major Gen. David Meade leads first wave of helicopters 
into Port-au-Prince airport. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Wave after wave of troops from the 10th Mountain Division begin to flow in 
from the Dwight D. Eisenhower aboard Blackhawk helicopters. Several Blackhawks 
are left at the airport in case the 10th is called into action. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Military police and other members of the 10th fan out in front of the 
airport and instruct a crowd of Haitians to stay back. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Lt. Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton, field commander of the Haiti operation, 
arrives. Under a heavy U.S. guard, he heads off to meet military leader Lt. 
Gen. Raoul Cedras at Haitian army headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Transport planes, including C141s and C5s, begin bringing in supplies to 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Key Staging Point 
</P>
<P>
 Until sufficient facilities are established ashore, the 10th Mountain's 50-odd 
helicopters will use the Eisenhower for refueling and major maintenance, a 
novel pairing of Army and Navy assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Troops and Equipment in Monday's Operation 
</P>
<P>
 * 3 battalions (battalions vary in size but could number as many as 900 
personnel) 
</P>
<P>
 * 22 Blackhawks 
</P>
<P>
 * 14 AH-1 Cobra attack gunship 
</P>
<P>
 * 12 OH-51 Scout helicopters 
</P>
<P>
 Time Frame 
</P>
<P>
 It will take up to 375 trips by the 10 Mountain Division's Blackhawk 
helicopters to get all of the men and equipment ashore, something that will 
take two or three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential Trouble Spots 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for Haitian soldiers to accompany U.S. forces into areas where 
there could be trouble. Helicopter-carried light infantry forces of the 10th 
Mountain Division are considered best suited to secure such areas. Possible 
flash points include: 
</P>
<P>
 Gonaives: Population 40,000, including an estimated 40 U.S. civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremie: Population 21,000; Aristide's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain areas: Treacherous terrain exists throughout the country, where some 
elevations exceed 7,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Times staff and wire reports ABOUT "OPERATION UPHOLD DEMOCRACY" 
</P>
<P>
 * 1,500 U.S. troops had entered Port-au-Prince by midafternoon Monday and 
3,000 to 4,000 were expected to be there by the end of the day, a senior U.S. 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The troops are fully armed, a requirement given the threat of sniper fire 
and guerrilla attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the troops' primary missions will be to disarm Haiti's civilians who 
threaten U.S. troops. There will be a gun buyback program and troops will 
disarm any hostile paramilitary forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * After American troops secure key entry points, other forces of the 25-nation 
coalition will enter Haiti to help police the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Pentagon has already called 1,600 reserve and National Guard forces to 
duty to support the regular troops in Haiti in areas ranging from air traffic 
control to military police.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; U.S. ADOPTS CAUTIOUS RULES OF ENGAGEMENT FOR MISSION; 
MILITARY: BUT TROOPS ARE TOLD TO SHOOT IF THEY FEEL 'THREATENED' BY CIVILIANS. 
FORCES WILL DISARM HAITIAN MILITIAMEN. 
</P>

<P>
 U.S. troops on duty in Haiti have been authorized to fire whenever they feel 
"threatened" by Haitians with weapons, even if the Haitians do not shoot first, 
Pentagon officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 American forces also will begin disarming Haitian militiamen and civilians 
found using their weapons against U.S. troops. That effort will be low-key, 
however, and U.S. soldiers will not conduct house-to-house searches to 
confiscate guns or other deadly weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, U.S. troops will not be sent into dangerous slum areas to 
help quell individual acts of violence, officials said. That job will be left 
to Haitian police units, with American forces stepping in only if the violence 
threatens general security. 
</P>
<P>
 The cautious rules of engagement, outlined by senior Pentagon officials 
Monday, appeared designed to avoid some of the difficulties that U.S. forces 
have encountered in previous engagements in heavily populated areas such as 
Panama and Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have charged that American forces killed hundreds of unarmed civilians 
in the invasion of Panama in December, 1989, because the rules of engagement 
there were too lax. In 1992 and 1993, the military's refusal to disarm the 
population in Somalia was criticized as a crucial oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground rules for the Haiti operation were disclosed as American forces 
completed their first day on the island, apparently without encountering any 
opposition from the Haitian military or from any civilian groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said that as of late afternoon, only two shots had been 
fired during the day's operations in Haiti -- both of them by Haitian police 
officers who were shooting into the air, the traditional means they use to 
break up crowds that threaten to become unruly. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military planners said they were making a special effort to enlist the 
help of Haitian military commander Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and existing police 
units to restore order to the nation. They even had asked some militiamen to 
return to uniform and to help patrol, the planners said. The theory was that 
involving the Haitian military would help reduce the risk to American troops. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Pentagon official said the effort would continue as long as the 
Haitians proved cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if they change the rules, we'll respond accordingly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said initial indications were that "they are going to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon said it expected to have 3,000 to 4,000 U.S. soldiers in Haiti by 
late Monday evening, with plans to increase the force to as many as 15,000, 
including a small contingency from Caribbean countries, within a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. forces now in Haiti have a four-part mission: to protect U.S. 
citizens and designated Haitian officials; to help quell armed attacks; to pave 
the way for civil affairs experts to begin restoring democracy, and to help 
preserve order. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of Monday's U.S. military activity involved unloading troops and 
equipment from ships, helicopters and C-5 transport planes onto the piers and 
airfield in Port-au-Prince, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said logistics experts will begin today to unload Bradley 
Fighting Vehicles and other equipment needed to help ensure order and to build 
up the port facilities. Humanitarian relief efforts are not expected to begin 
until later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Military operations officers conceded Monday that they were forced to go back 
to the drawing boards late Sunday night and redesign the entire operation after 
President Clinton announced that Cedras and his fellow leaders had agreed to 
step down -- but not immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial battle plan had assumed that U.S. troops would face one of two 
contingencies: Either they would have to fight their way onto the island, or 
the Haitian military would step down and American forces could easily take 
complete control. 
</P>
<P>
 But the eleventh-hour agreement negotiated on Clinton's behalf by a delegation 
headed by former President Jimmy Carter provided that while Cedras would not 
try to block U.S. troops from doing their jobs, he also would remain in power 
for as long as another month, forcing the Pentagon to change plans quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few hours, military planners put together a new force package 
that discarded the initial assault units and picked up with previous plans for 
a smaller post-invasion force equipped primarily to keep order and pave the way 
for relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 It also meant quickly reshuffling the kinds of equipment and weaponry that 
would be needed for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials said the Pentagon would take the operation a day at a time, 
watching the effort unfold and adjusting rules and tactics accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intent is, over time, that we will sort these kinds of conditions out," 
one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to involve Haitian military and police units is a crucial element in 
the current U.S. strategy. U.S. military officials met with Cedras on Monday to 
talk about obtaining that cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 And officials said Washington also hopes to pressure Haitian officials to use 
their own gun-control laws to reduce the number of weapons in circulation, 
suggesting that it would help push the Haitians to take more responsibility for 
their country. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. military officials warned that the risks still are high and that the 
situation could sour. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States "must be prepared for the unexpected," Gen. John M. 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a briefing.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; HAITIANS FIND PACT PERPLEXING; REACTION: BOTH 
SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS OF MILITARY SKEPTICAL THAT ARMY WILL LEAVE POWER, LET 
ARISTIDE RULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The agreement that is supposed to force Haiti's junta from power here and 
restore exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has left Haitian political and 
business leaders confused and uncertain that arriving U.S. forces really mean 
this nation is liberated from military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Clinton and Carter have been fooled," said a member of one of Haiti's 
oldest families, who heads a major drug manufacturing firm, referring to 
President Clinton and former President Jimmy Carter. "The generals have won." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an odd assessment, given that it was made as the speaker and a reporter 
watched one U.S. Army helicopter after another land at the airport here to 
disgorge tons of equipment and the early detachments of what will eventually 
total 15,000 American soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the opinion was hardly unique and not limited to opponents of the junta, 
whose members are often described by U.S. officials as "thugs in uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Haitians (in the military) manage this well," said one businessman 
strongly opposed to Aristide, "they will be on top of Aristide, even if he does 
return and Cedras, Biamby and Francois are out." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the Haitian strongman; Brig. Gen. 
Philippe Biamby, the army chief of staff; and Police Chief Col. Michel-Joseph 
Francois. They are the three leaders of the 1991 coup that overthrew Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement negotiated Sunday with a team led by former President 
Carter, the three Haitian military leaders are to resign and give up power no 
later than Oct. 15. That agreement, which also guarantees Aristide's return 
when the regime's leaders leave, is backed by the American troops. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Haitians -- accustomed to their army's tactics, which have included 
deviousness and lying -- fear that the Americans have been duped. They point to 
what they say are ambiguities and absences in the brief accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "First," said one pro-Aristide political expert, "Cedras didn't sign it. Next, 
four weeks is just too long. What happens if Cedras says he won't go because no 
amnesty law is passed? Do you think the American troops will shoot him or 
arrest him? I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Missing too from the accord, and from any discussion by American officials in 
Washington or by Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, the U.S. troop commander here, was the 
fate of the 7,000-member Haitian army. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and Aristide previously had insisted on the separation of 
the Haitian police from the army; the reduction of the military to about 1,500 
soldiers, who largely would be border guards and road builders; and the 
retraining of all the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But Haitians briefed by the Carter mission and other U.S. officials said these 
American demands, if they ever were serious, were scuttled during Carter's two 
days of talks so the negotiators could get Cedras and Biamby to accept the 
general accord. 
</P>
<P>
 The skepticism of many Haitians -- interviewed in the aftermath of the 
dramatic Sunday night agreement -- also showed a widespread lack of 
comprehension of the meaning of the U.S. troops now present here. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them believe business in Haiti will go on as usual, that the 
Parliament will refuse to pass an amnesty law called for in the agreement, that 
Cedras will find some way to stay, that the anti-Aristide forces will keep the 
exiled president out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be just like the Harlan County and Governors Island," said 
one professional who opposes the military. He was discussing a July, 1993, 
agreement, signed by Cedras, in which he promised to resign and leave the 
country by October, 1993, and permit Aristide's restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras reneged on that agreement Oct. 11, 1993, when he organized an armed mob 
to prevent the landing of a U.S. military cargo ship, the Harlan County, and 
caused the collapse of the accord. "What's to stop them from doing the same 
thing now?" asked the Haitian professional. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was pointed out that 15,000 U.S. troops would make the difference, he 
just shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 A diplomat here observed: "It's an amazing thing. (The Haitians) just don't 
seem to be able to understand that this is a military occupation and that 
Shelton is the military governor. He may not do a good job, and that could mean 
being fooled by the military. But he may do a good job and that will mean the 
end of life as these people know it. But it will be the American officers who 
decide, not Haitians." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Haitians who are close to the officers who are supposed to leave 
under the agreement, Cedras will depart Haiti, "probably no later than Sept. 
30." And, as a result of three years of leading what is widely regarded as one 
of the most corrupt regimes in the history of the region, "you know that Cedras 
has no financial worries," said one Haitian businessman who knows the 
commanding general and his luxury-minded wife, Yannik. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves Spain and he has a home already in Spain," the businessman said. 
"Yannik would rather live there, and if Raoul thinks he might be president some 
day, he's young and can come back after the Americans leave." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Francois, whose resolve was largely responsible for the success of the 
1991 anti-Aristide coup, "he will resign and take care of business," said a 
close friend. That business, he said, will be the opening of a chain of target 
ranges specializing in pistol shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Biamby might not go quite so gently, this source said, noting, "He is a coup 
man. He will resign but you can bet he won't leave. He'll just stay around and 
wait for the Americans to leave. He'll try again." The Agreement 
</P>
<P>
 Text of the agreement signed Sunday in Port-au-Prince by former President 
Jimmy Carter and Haiti's acting president, Emile Jonassaint. 
</P>
<P>
 1-The purpose of the agreement is to foster peace in Haiti, to avoid violence 
and bloodshed, to promote freedom and democracy, and to forge a sustained and 
mutually beneficial relationship between the governments, people and 
institutions of Haiti and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 2-To implement this agreement, the Haitian military and police forces will 
work in close cooperation with the U.S. Military Mission. This cooperation, 
conducted with mutual respect, will last during the transitional period 
required for ensuring vital institutions of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 3-In order to personally contribute to the success of this agreement, certain 
military officers of the Haitian armed forces are willing to consent to an 
early and honorable retirement in accordance with U.N. Resolutions 917 and 940 
when a general amnesty will be voted into law by the Haitian Parliament, or 
Oct. 15, 1994, whichever is earlier. The parties to this agreement pledge to 
work with the Haitian Parliament to expedite this action. Their successors will 
be named according to the Haitian constitution and existing military law. 
</P>
<P>
 4-The military activities of the U.S. Military Mission will be coordinated 
with the Haitian military high command. 
</P>
<P>
 5-The economic embargo and the economic sanctions will be lifted without delay 
in accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions and the need of the Haitian people 
will be met as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 6-The forthcoming legislative elections will be held in a free and democratic 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
 7-It is understood that the above agreement is conditioned on the approval of 
the civilian governments of the United States and Haiti.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; HOUSE ENDORSES TROOPS, SIDESTEPS BACKING POLICY; 
CONGRESS: DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO AVOID DIVISIVE DEBATE. U.S. LAWMAKERS MAY SET 
DEADLINE FOR WITHDRAWAL.

 Relieved that U.S. forces were able to enter Haiti without bloodshed Monday, 
the House overwhelmingly endorsed the agreement negotiated by former President 
Jimmy Carter for the removal of Haiti's military leaders. But the Clinton 
Administration faced an embarrassing confrontation with Congress as angry 
lawmakers demanded a deadline for the troops' withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 With congressional sentiment still running strongly against the so-far 
peaceful military intervention, Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate 
scrambled to avert a conflict with President Clinton. They crafted a carefully 
worded resolution supporting the mission of the 15,000 troops being sent to 
Haiti without endorsing the policy that put them there. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution passed the House, 353 to 45. But it faces delays in the Senate, 
where Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and other Republicans balked at what 
they said was language possibly implying support for the U.S. occupation. 
Negotiations continued, but a vote was not expected before today. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders made no secret of their hope that the Haitian military 
junta's agreement to relinquish power by Oct. 15 would avert a divisive debate, 
which would likely undermine Clinton and embarrass the Democrats by exposing 
their differences and disarray over foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Democrats are grateful to President Carter for allowing us to dodge a 
congressional bullet and grateful to President Clinton for proving once again 
that, when he's put in a corner, he's at his best," said Rep. Bill Richardson 
(D-N.M.), a member of the Democratic leadership who also sits on the House 
Intelligence Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But while opponents in both chambers agreed that the arrival of the troops in 
Haiti had changed the dynamics of the debate, and would at least temporarily 
mute much of the congressional criticism, many Democrats and Republicans said 
they will move after a "decent interval" to introduce legislation setting a 
deadline for the forces' withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most members want to support the troops . . . and now that the first step has 
been successful, they are reluctant to undercut it," said Sen. William S. Cohen 
(R-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
 But citing the problems that occurred in Somalia, Cohen predicted that 
Congress will not give Clinton a long "grace period," especially if the 
occupying American forces start to incur casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is relief that the negotiations with Haiti's military leaders were 
successful, but this doesn't void the basic conflict that this Administration 
has with the majority in Congress over our presence in Haiti and the commitment 
that's been made," agreed Rep. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.), chairman of the 
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was going to be a dramatic confrontation between Congress and the 
Administration in the hours after the invasion is now going to be a slow and 
simmering one over the months to come as we attempt to limit this occupation," 
Torricelli added. 
</P>
<P>
 "A congressional confrontation has been postponed, but probably not avoided. 
Republicans will want to set a withdrawal deadline as soon as possible and my 
guess is a lot of Democrats will support them," a House Democratic leadership 
aide said, adding that House leaders fear a prolonged debate would undermine 
Clinton and his legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully worded to avoid any expression of support for either the occupation 
or Haiti's exiled president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the resolution commended 
the delegation led by Carter that negotiated the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Haitian military leaders would leave office by Oct. 15, 
paving the way for Aristide's return and the restoration of democracy in the 
impoverished Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution states that the Congress "fully supports . . . the Armed Forces 
who are carrying out their mission in Haiti with professional excellence," but 
also supports their "orderly withdrawal . . . as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Clinton's decision to intervene militarily in Haiti, it said only that the 
lawmakers supported his "efforts, through the (Carter) delegation, to provide 
for the departure" of the Haitian junta and for "the return of democracy and 
the rule of law in Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republicans were leery of even that language, however, and efforts were 
being made to "accommodate their concerns because anything less than an 
overwhelming, bipartisan vote on this could send the wrong message to Cedras 
and company," a Democratic leadership source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was clear that most lawmakers remain opposed to the intervention, 
which they fear will turn into an open-ended commitment full of the dangers 
that faced U.S. forces in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implementation of this agreement is going to be difficult . . . It is not 
a risk-free situation," warned Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) said he would introduce a resolution 
aimed at forcing a full-scale congressional debate on of the Haitian crisis 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haiti has, in effect, just been made a wholly owned subsidiary of the United 
States . . . and we are on the threshold of a long occupation," said Cox, 
adding that a commitment of this scope is "just bad policy" unless Congress has 
approved it first.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; CLINTON, CARTER AIDES DEBATE WISDOM OF USE OF FORCE; 
NEGOTIATIONS: FORMER PRESIDENT SAYS WHITE HOUSE DECISION TO LAUNCH FIRST PHASE 
OF INVASION ALMOST KILLED THE DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Behind their polite smiles and mutual congratulations, President Clinton, 
former President Jimmy Carter and their associates conducted a quiet but 
intense debate Monday on a central element of the weekend's events: 
</P>
<P>
 Was Clinton's decision to launch the first phase of the U.S. invasion Sunday 
the final stroke that forced Haiti's generals to yield? Or was it a blunder 
that almost killed a deal? 
</P>
<P>
 The argument goes beyond the simple question of who gets credit for the deal 
and reaches a central dilemma in post-Cold War American foreign policy: What is 
the proper use of force? 
</P>
<P>
 As related by Clinton Administration officials Sunday night, talks between 
Carter's delegation and Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, Haiti's military commander, had 
stalled earlier that day. Cedras bent to the U.S. will, these officials said, 
only after being informed by his chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, 
that U.S. planes carrying paratroopers were in the air, heading their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter offered a very different account. The former President said the Haitian 
generals almost abandoned the talks when they heard that the warplanes were on 
their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were on the verge of saying, 'We will not negotiate anymore, this may be 
a trick just to keep us occupied, all of us military commanders, in the same 
room while the invasion takes place,' " Carter said during a news conference at 
the White House. "The thing was about to break down." 
</P>
<P>
 That account is in marked contrast to statements made the night before by 
senior U.S. officials, beginning with Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am absolutely convinced that it was being aware of the preparations of such 
an overwhelming force that caused him to blink," Shalikashvili said, recounting 
to reporters how Biamby brought Cedras the news that the American planes were 
in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute reflects, in part, two very different views of the usefulness of 
force. Administration officials, having engaged in frustrating talks with the 
Haitians for more than a year, grew convinced months ago that only force would 
cause the generals to abandon power. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, however, in his continuing role as an international mediator, seems 
increasingly convinced that while the threat of force may be useful, the actual 
use of military power can almost always be avoided by diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose interpretation of events is more nearly correct may never be known. But 
this much is clear: The launching of the planes from Pope Air Force Base in 
North Carolina, coupled with Clinton's concerns about getting the delegation 
out before the formations reached Haiti, put considerable pressure on both 
sides to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time we talked, he (Carter) said, 'Well, we're almost there, we've 
about got this nailed, we're going over to the presidential palace,' and I 
said, 'OK, you have 30 more minutes, and then I will have to order you to 
leave' because I was worried about their personal security," Clinton recalled 
during the White House news conference. "They had to get (out) before dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras himself has made no public comments about his motivations in agreeing 
to the deal, and even if he does so in the future, his statements would, no 
doubt, be colored by his own concerns about self-image. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Administration officials were doing their best to paper over 
the difference, insisting that even if Carter and Clinton disagreed about the 
utility of actually launching the planes, they agreed that the generals were 
willing to negotiate only after they had been convinced, during discussions 
Saturday, about what Carter termed "the inexorability of the entry of the 
forces into Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 And with the dispute only a few hours old, policy-makers were already using 
their conflicting views of what happened to draw grand lessons for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland), chairman of the House Armed Services 
Committee and a longtime anti-war spokesman, declared in a statement that 
"while the threat of military force may have played a role in the timing of the 
agreement, it was effective diplomacy, focused on the right issues, that 
provided the desired result." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a chief advocate of using military force 
in Haiti, said Sunday's events proved that Cedras "would not, in fact, honor 
the agreement he had already made until he knew the military was in the air 
heading toward Haiti with parachutes."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; TOP U.S. GENERAL IN HAITI CALLED STEADY, UNFLAPPABLE 
</P>

<P>
 When young Hugh Shelton came home for Christmas during his senior year at 
North Carolina State University, his mother, Patsy, recalled with amusement how 
he had everything planned, down to the chrome on the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll graduate and get my (Army) commission," he told her. "Then I'm going to 
buy a new Chevrolet sports car and I'm going to get married. Then I'm going 
into the service." 
</P>
<P>
 By the next September, Shelton -- who always buys Corvettes -- had done 
everything he planned, just as he had all through high school and before that 
all through the 4-H Club. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 31 years since, his penchant for organization has continued to serve 
Henry Hugh Shelton, the 52-year-old Army lieutenant general who is in charge of 
American forces in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton has a quiet self-assurance and a serious but easy-going manner that 
draws people, according to friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends' assessment was echoed by Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, who was 
Shelton's boss at the Joint Chiefs of Staff's operations directorate. He 
described Shelton as "steady and unflappable" -- a military leader who counts 
more on precise analysis and quiet persuasion than on bold strokes and bad 
temper. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't get rattled," Kelly said. "He always worked for difficult people 
like me, and I couldn't find his breaking point." 
</P>
<P>
 That unflappability, Kelly added, could be tested to its limit by a mission 
that lies in the military nether world between peace and war. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shelton has a light touch with diplomats and politicians. "He's a fellow 
who will never forget to be polite," Kelly said. "Hugh can handle the State 
Department types." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Shelton, in the lone public comment he gave before arriving 
in Haiti, talked about the "delicate balance" for American forces in Haiti. 
"The Haitian people are not our enemy, yet the Haitian armed forces and police 
have capabilities that we have to defend against," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former North Carolina farm boy has become one of the Army's rising stars, 
a veteran of Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, the Pentagon and the fabled 82nd 
Airborne, the elite paratrooper group trained to go -- with force, if necessary 
-- into countries where the enemy controls the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton, who rose to the command of some of the Army's most elite units at a 
young age, "represents the next generation of Army leadership," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his current post, Shelton is commanding general of the 18th Airborne Corps, 
the nation's rapid-deployment specialists, and of their home base of Ft. Bragg 
in North Carolina, one of the largest military bases in the world. The troops 
from the 18th, including the 10th Mountain Division light infantry and the 82nd 
Airborne Division paratroopers, are expected to provide the bulk of American 
troops in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way up the Army ranks, the man who set out to work in textile 
manufacturing has passed by many a West Point graduate. Shelton grew up in 
Edgecome County near a tiny community called Speed, the oldest of four 
children, the son of a farmer father and teacher mother. 
</P>
<P>
 He helped grow tobacco, corn, soybeans and cotton on his father's farms during 
the summers. His first accomplishments, his mother Sarah (Patsy) Shelton said, 
came from his intense involvement in the 4-H clubs. "He was always a leader. 
You could always see it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangy at 6-feet-4 and 215 pounds, he played high school basketball and went on 
to North Carolina State, like his father and three uncles, where he took 
Reserve Officers Training Corps courses. He liked them so well, his family 
remembers, he decided to continue with ROTC for all four of his college years. 
</P>
<P>
 After college, he married his high school sweetheart, Carolyn L. Johnson, at 
the Speed Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as he had told his mother he would do, he entered the Army. After his 
initial two-year hitch ended, he took a job with Riegel Textile Corp. near 
Greenville, S.C. But after a month of civilian life, he told his wife he missed 
the Army, the closeness of people, the quality of the noncommissioned officers 
and the camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
 After re-entering the Army more than a year later, he began the first of two 
Vietnam tours. In the first tour in 1964, he conducted long-range 
reconnaissance work as part of the special forces, earning a Bronze Star and a 
Purple Heart after stepping into a booby-trap that drove a poison-tipped stake 
into his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton told an interviewer three years ago that in his opinion the U.S. 
attempt to wage the Vietnam War with "minimum force . . . almost a gentleman's 
war" was a mistake. The United States "did not use the appropriate amount of 
force." 
</P>
<P>
 Old friends such as Jack P. Jordan, a college buddy, describe Shelton as "sort 
of laid back, as most of us small-town boys are." 
</P>
<P>
 "He acts that way until something serious happens," said Shelton's mother.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; UBIQUITOUS CNN AGAIN PROVES THAT IT PLAYS A NEARLY 
INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN CRISES; MEDIA: GLOBAL GAINS GIVE NETWORK A CRITICAL -- 
AND SOMETIMES TRIVIAL -- PRESENCE ON WORLD STAGE.

 Here's a scene from the new world of diplomacy and war: Former President Jimmy 
Carter and Haitian strongman Raoul Cedras are in tense negotiations in 
Port-au-Prince. Whenever the omnipresent television set, tuned via satellite to 
Cable News Network, carries the latest word on the Haitian crisis, the room 
falls silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another scene: It is 3 a.m. Monday. The crisis has been defused. CNN 
President Tom Johnson is speaking by telephone with Carter, who is back at the 
White House. They agree that the former President will appear for an interview 
four hours later -- a broadcast that, it turns out, will occur before Carter 
has had a chance to brief President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House, a well-placed CNN source said dryly later Monday morning, was 
not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 In an arena once dominated by secret cables, public threats and private 
messages, the revolution in global communications is playing a new role -- one 
that is at times critical, at times trivial. And, by the accounts of those who 
have played central roles in such national security crises, CNN has become a 
nearly indispensable participant. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when Clinton spoke to the nation at 9:30 p.m. EDT Sunday, he 
said: "Our objective . . . has been to make sure that the military dictators 
leave power and that the democratically elected government is returned." 
</P>
<P>
 Five other times in his seven-minute speech, Clinton referred to the 
"dictators" in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 At a moment when it remained uncertain whether the Haitian triumvirate on whom 
the negotiations had focused would stand by the deal, such language created 
serious anxiety within the American negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, CNN reported that it had a transcript of such a conversation between 
Carter, who was flying back to Washington, and an assistant, Robert Pastor, who 
remained in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk was this: Lt. Gen. Cedras, the Haitian army commander, Brig. Gen. 
Philippe Biamby, the army chief of staff, and Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, 
the powerful police chief of Port-au-Prince, might undo the plan for them to 
leave office, out of pique at the way they were being described by the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter CNN, and Carter's media savvy. By 7 a.m. Monday, Carter was being 
interviewed by the network and using the opportunity to point out the need to 
respect the agreement and to remind the Haitian leadership that it "was 
negotiated with dignity for both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not every step in a diplomatic crisis is played out in full view of 
television cameras. The negotiations in Haiti on Saturday and Sunday were 
behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 But swift reporting of developments -- such as CBS News' interview with Cedras 
immediately after Clinton threw down the gauntlet Thursday to the Haitian junta 
in a White House speech -- and the very public nature of those reports creates 
an atmosphere that can deny the key players in Washington or other crisis 
centers the time and maneuvering room they enjoyed in earlier days. 
</P>
<P>
 That instantaneous feedback increases the pressure on officials and the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was especially concerned CNN was seen all over Haiti and it was being 
viewed in real time," Johnson said. "I wanted to make sure we didn't in any way 
compromise the security of the operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Johanna Neuman, who is writing a book on the impact of media technology on 
international affairs, said that for more than 100 years, political leaders 
have had to adjust during crises to technological developments: Abraham Lincoln 
had to contend with the telegraph hastening reports of the Civil War and the 
radio speeded up reporting on World War II to Franklin D. Roosevelt and the 
rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In this light, she said, global live television is merely the latest 
communications development to play into -- and possibly tie -- the hands of 
policy-makers. It lets them reach directly to the American people for support 
and speak at the same time to a Saddam Hussein in his bunker in Baghdad. "It's 
a tool and they learn to use it as a tool," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pressure to be on top of the story at every turn can lead to some 
less-than-enlightening developments. Take, for example, the scene that played 
out near the entrance to the White House West Wing on Sunday, well before the 
resolution of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry and Tom Donilon, the assistant 
secretary of state for public affairs, grew tired of waiting at the State 
Department for the negotiations in Haiti to conclude. So they headed to the 
White House to kill time and munch pizza with colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we went over there . . . and walked by (CNN correspondent) Wolf Blitzer 
and waved as we went in, and by the time we were in eating our pizza, he 
announced breathlessly to the waiting world that there must be something 
significant developing because Assistant Secretary Donilon and the department 
spokesman from the State Department had just wandered in," McCurry told 
reporters Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 He added in a wisecrack addressed to CNN's senior White House correspondent: 
"Sorry, Wolf, it was pepperoni."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; MIAMI'S HAITIANS SPEAKING OF BEWILDERMENT, BETRAYAL; 
EXPATRIATES: SOME FEEL CEDRAS WILL RENEGE ON HIS PROMISES AGAIN. OTHERS FEAR 
EXTENDED OCCUPATION.

 The Little Haiti neighborhood here seemed haunted by history Monday, the 
people riven with mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
 In barber shops and offices, exiles watched live satellite broadcasts of 
American troops pouring into their homeland and even people two generations too 
young for firsthand knowledge of the event recalled the last U.S. occupation of 
Haiti as if they had been there for each of its 19 years. "I know what happened 
in 1915," said Miguel Jean, 33, a security guard. "They came and then didn't 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
 In the restaurant Chez Moy, the staff listened to President Clinton's 
televised explanation from the White House of the U.S. deal with Haitian junta 
leader Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras. The staff talked back to the television screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the problem!" interjected manager Johnny Origene as the President 
said Cedras and the other coup leaders would be gone by Oct. 15. "Cedras has 
said that before." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this inner-city neighborhood, home to about 70,000 Haitians -- one 
of the largest Haitian communities in the United States -- themes of betrayal 
and bewilderment were sounded often and loudly on the first day of the second 
American occupation of Haiti this century. (The first occupation ended in 
1934.) 
</P>
<P>
 "There were two things the Haitian people wanted: Cedras out and (exiled 
President Jean-Bertrand) Aristide in. And we have neither one," said travel 
agent Carole Thebaud. "So this accord is a little fishy." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday, just after the news of the agreement became known, about 75 
people took their protest into Northeast 54th Street, the main artery through 
Miami's Little Haiti, blocking traffic. Community activist Samedi Florvil was 
one of those leading the anti-Cedras chant: "Leave now! Leave now!" 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, Florvil sat calmly in the offices of Veye Yo , a local 
political group that supports Aristide, watching history unfold. "More lies," 
he muttered as U.S. officials spoke in a Washington news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the streets were tranquil Monday, the anger remained. A small crowd 
gathered around a man holding up a poster collage of gruesome photographs of 
bullet-riddled bodies and faces hacked open with machetes. Beneath all was a 
picture of Cedras and the words: "May the blood ooze into you and your goons." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are kind of upset," said Father Tom Wenski, a priest at Notre Dame 
d'Haiti Roman Catholic Church. "They are waiting to see what happens. They are 
cynical. And when they hear (former President Jimmy) Carter say the U.S. 
military is going in as partners with the Haitian military, that sends the 
wrong signal." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a widespread feeling of relief that no blood had been shed in Haiti, 
many here expressed incredulity over the power-sharing arrangement that leaves 
Cedras in place -- at least for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Biamby, director of the Pierre Toussaint Catholic Center, called the 
agreement "a disgrace, a severe blow to democracy and the Haitian people." 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Beltrau, 54, broadcasting his opinion at curbside, declared: "Nobody can 
trust Cedras! See what happened after Governors Island." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, to many Haitians in Miami, where support for Aristide remains strong, 
the treaty signed by Cedras in July, 1993, at Governors Island in New York 
Harbor stands as proof of his treachery. Aristide was to return to Haiti last 
October, after Cedras resigned. But Cedras reneged on his pledge, setting the 
stage for an American-led intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Some here support the agreement and accept the American occupation as the 
lesser of evils. "At least this prevented an invasion where blood would have 
been spilled," said grocer Lionel Cayard, 37. "It's a solution for right now, 
and we'll have to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 And almost everyone hopes that a stabilization of the country will mean a 
quick end to the economic embargo, especially the recent provisions that 
prevent large cash transfers and led to a halt of air traffic between Haiti and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Cayard said his grocery trade has dropped by as much as 25% since flights 
ended. Travelers to Haiti regularly carried boxes of toothpaste, soap, food and 
other hard-to-get items to Port-au-Prince, while on return flights he received 
Haitian peppers, fresh thyme, favored bouillon cubes. 
</P>
<P>
 And Thebaud, the travel agent, said she was days from closing her doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost 80% of our business when we couldn't book flights to Haiti," she 
said.

ATLANTIC CITY GAMBLES ON PERKS AS LURE FOR POLICE OFFICERS INTO SETTING UP 
HOUSE; URBAN LIFE: A $5-MILLION CASINO FUND PROVIDES NEARLY INTEREST-FREE 
HOUSING AND TAKE-HOME PATROL CARS. SO FAR, THERE HAVE BEEN NO TAKERS. 
</P>

<P>
 On the surface, this East Coast gambling resort, which draws millions of 
visitors a year, might seem to have it all: sea, sand and a castle called 
Trump. But Atlantic City, with its deeper problems, now is trying to throw 
money at its police officers just to get them to move back here. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual gamble over a dilemma faced by many large cities, including Los 
Angeles, Atlantic City has pooled $5 million from its casino endowment fund to 
pay for practically no-interest home mortgage loans that the mayor, police 
chief and casino commission hope will convince the police that living here is 
worth the price. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers would get loans at next to nothing, accelerated monthly payment 
schedules, even free take-home city cars. Yet, while there have been many 
inquiries since the program was announced earlier this summer, there still are 
no takers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, even some of those pitching the plan the hardest -- such as the 
police chief and the head of the police union -- admit they have no intention 
of taking advantage of such a sweetheart deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting calls now from all around the country from police departments 
looking at what we're trying to do here," boasted Police Chief Nicholas Rifice. 
</P>
<P>
 But he lives north of the city and his kids are in school there, and he 
doesn't plan to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a lot of positive feedback from the rank and file. I think they 
like it," said the president of the Police Benevolent Assn., Robert Campbell. 
He also lives outside Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure all the loans will be taken," predicted Sgt. Ernest Jubilee. He is 
the Police Department's chief spokesman and, with just a couple of years left 
before his retirement, he sees no reason to pull up stakes in the comfortable 
suburb of Pleasantville and move back to Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the police officials believe that the giveaway better suits young 
police officers, those who are single or married with only young children, the 
kind who might be more adaptable to moving. 
</P>
<P>
 But therein lies the rub. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, as crime, poverty and urban decay moved into Atlantic City 
before and after the casinos arrived, rookie officers steadily migrated out of 
the city. Today, only about 21% of the 400 officers call Atlantic City home. 
</P>
<P>
 That figure is comparable to Los Angeles, where 17% of the force lives in the 
city, according to findings released earlier this year by the American Civil 
Liberties Union. City Hall officials in Los Angeles have begun weighing similar 
programs, including rent subsidies and salary incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Under New Jersey law, city officials cannot impose a residency requirement on 
police officers to force them to live within the city limits. But city 
officials can require that new officers, when they are hired and join the 
police academy, live in Atlantic City. So the vast majority of the recruits 
take apartments in the city during their training and then, once they get their 
badge, they bolt for the 'burbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't keep them," said Campbell. "We can't make them stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Nicholas R. Amato can. At least he's going to try. 
</P>
<P>
 Amato is executive director of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority 
on Atlantic Avenue here. He said he thought up the plan, won support from City 
Hall and drew up the contributions from the casino reinvestment fund. He 
brought in the Washington-based Police Foundation to study the situation and 
now is crossing his fingers that his real estate venture is going to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a perception that Atlantic City is not safe, and having a police 
officer living on your street helps change that perception," he said. "We have 
to make it clean and safe and affordable." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Amato isn't a permanent resident here either, but rather commutes 
home on weekends to northern New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor James Whalen does live here, and his son, a police officer, lives 
with him. Although the son has not yet committed, his father is nudging him to 
sign up and buy his own home in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of how many officers sign up, and I think we'll fill the initial 
round of 35 loans, there are other things we are doing to make life attractive 
here," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic City is unique in that it is merely 40 blocks long, with just 35,000 
residents, but it swells with more than 30 million tourist visits a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Police respond to 300,000 calls each year. Visitors who stop at the first red 
light off the Atlantic City Expressway see an eerie scene of glitzy high-rise 
casinos next to the blight of boarded-up downtown buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fancy hotels, employees warn tourists not to wander off the boardwalk 
at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of the city's tough image as a crime zone, Chief Rifice has begun a 
series of efforts to get more desk officers back on the street and to step up 
community policing programs. He said there have been some gains already in 
lowering violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Amato argues that turning more officers into homeowners is the best 
community policing program ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that crime and cops cannot exist on the same street," he said. 
"People aren't so dumb to hang out and sell dope and rob people in front of a 
policeman's house." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how the so-called 3-2-1 Police Loan Program works: 
</P>
<P>
 An officer and his or her family choose a home, then turn for financing to 
Amato's casino panel. The commission has earmarked $5 million to cover the 
first 35 loans. The loan limits would be $120,000, and no down payments are 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest rates are set by three categories depending on the type of 
neighborhood the officer selects. 
</P>
<P>
 In the roughest areas, an officer would pay only a $100 application fee and 
just 1% interest on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. But for every year he or she 
lives there, a year is lopped off the back of the loan, meaning the officer 
would own the home free and clear in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan parameters stay the same for the other neighborhoods too, except that 
a medium area would have a $200 application fee and 2% interest, while the best 
area would require a $300 application fee and 3% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The money comes from reimbursements paid back to the commission by three Trump 
casinos: Trump Castle, Trump Plaza and the Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer would get a free patrol car to take home and use on personal 
errands, but the officer must park the car on the street or in the home's 
driveway. The car must be visible. The officer also must respond to any nearby 
disturbances heard on the car radio. 
</P>
<P>
 When the program was announced this summer, a flurry of police officers 
arrived at the commission's headquarters downtown, just a couple of blocks from 
the famed boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Jubilee said one officer told colleagues he was returning to Atlantic 
City, then changed his mind and built a pool in his back yard in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another officer has said he may apply for a loan, but he already lives in the 
city with his parents. And a husband and wife who are both officers also are 
considering the program, but they also already live in the city as renters. 
</P>
<P>
 While that kind of interest is promising, Hubert Williams, director of the 
Police Foundation, said it still misses the goal of getting more officers back 
in the city. It was Williams who studied the Atlantic City police residency 
patterns and helped shape the program with Amato. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the more advanced thinking projects in police work in the 
country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you set up a situation where police are working and living with the 
public in a positive way, it reduces fear and enhances the reputation of the 
police department," Williams said.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: HISTORY LESSONS COUNT IN SIMPSON CASE, AND DEFENSE 
HAS TOP TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When trying to understand the strategy of O.J. Simpson's lawyers, it's helpful 
to know a little history. 
</P>
<P>
 As you could see during a televised hearing on Monday, the defense has 
launched a hard-hitting attack not only on the Police Department, but also on 
the coroner's office. Defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro blasted homicide 
detectives for waiting too long to call the coroner. Then he went on to assail 
the coroner's office. "We are forever excluded from knowing the time of death," 
he said. "The coroner simply threw away the contents of the stomachs, which is 
one of the best ways of determining time of death." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark sharply defended the investigation, saying: 
"We have investigators. They are not lawyers who nit-pick their way through 
every nuance." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps Clark should be thinking of less flip answers, because sitting at 
the defense table is a man who has shown in the past that he knows how to 
unravel a police probe and who understands the mysteries and pitfalls of a 
coroner's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a young lawyer, Cochran stepped into the investigation of the death of 
Leonard Deadwyler, an unarmed black man who was shot and killed by a Los 
Angeles police officer. The cop had stopped Deadwyler's car while he was 
rushing his pregnant wife to a hospital in 1966, a year after the Watts riot. 
</P>
<P>
 The case ended up in an inquest by a coroner's jury that was televised live. 
Televising it was rare in those days, and the city watched, fascinated by the 
proceedings. Watts was still on L.A.'s mind. The atmosphere was politically 
charged, and the investigation of Deadwyler's death became a powerful cause in 
the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 The community, still traumatized by Watts, watched with pride as the young 
black lawyer named Johnnie tore into the law enforcement establishment. Despite 
his efforts, the jury agreed with the police version, that the death was 
justified. The decision further polarized a racially divided city and left the 
black community more embittered against law enforcement. And it was the 
beginning of Cochran's high-visibility legal career. 
</P>
<P>
 About a decade after the Deadwyler inquest, Cochran again took on the 
coroner's office in a cause celebre case. This time he won. 
</P>
<P>
 It involved the death of Ron Settles, a black Cal State Long Beach football 
star who was found hanged in his cell in the Signal Hill jail after being 
arrested for speeding. The Signal Hill cops insisted that Settles hanged 
himself. But the jury ruled that Settles had died "at the hands of another." 
His family was awarded $760,000 in a wrongful death suit settled in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the victory, the Settles case still lingers in the memories of African 
American activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran is also aware of another disputed coroner's case, although he wasn't 
part of it. Like most everyone else who understands L.A., he knows the scars it 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the death of journalist Ruben Salazar, who was killed when sheriff's 
deputies fired a tear gas canister into an Eastside bar during an anti-war 
demonstration in 1970. The missile struck and killed Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
 Salazar, a Times columnist and news director of Spanish language television 
station KMEX, had become a powerful advocate for the Latino community, and a 
critic of law enforcement methods in the Latino community. Even today, many 
Latino activists say he was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cops said it was an accident. Three members of a coroners jury 
supported the accident theory while four others said only that Salazar died "at 
the hands of another." It was a result that added to Latino community suspicion 
of law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicion extends beyond minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 John Van de Kamp, a former district attorney and state attorney general, told 
me recently, "There is greater skepticism about the veracity of police. Police 
are being treated more as regular witnesses today rather than coming in with a 
presumption of total integrity and honesty." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the coroner's office, Van de Kamp said: "We had very mixed experiences 
when I was D.A. . . . Their ability to testify is not first rate." 
</P>
<P>
 All this history, all those feelings, go into the mix of potential Simpson 
jurors, who will be selected beginning Monday. Cochran's experience and 
knowledge of L.A. -- and the fact that he's part of the city's recent history 
-- gives him a unique understanding of how to reach them.

DRUNK DRIVING ARRESTS CONTINUE TO DECLINE IN CALIFORNIA; LAW ENFORCEMENT: CASES 
INVOLVING LATINOS ALSO DROP. A SPANISH-LANGUAGE EDUCATION PROGRAM IS CREDITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arrests for drunk driving continue to drop in California -- although not as 
sharply as in the past -- and the large number of Latinos among those arrested 
is gradually declining, according to statistics recently released by the 
California Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Latinos, who make up 25% of the state's population, still accounted 
for 46.5% of all arrests for DUI -- driving under the influence -- in 
California last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials attribute the decline in Latino arrests in part to a 5-year-old 
statewide Spanish-language education program disseminated through Roman 
Catholic churches, classes in English as a second language, billboards and 
posters at liquor stores and bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This reduction in DUI arrests demonstrates an increase in awareness of the 
dangers of drinking and driving among the state's Hispanic population," 
California Highway Patrol Commissioner Maurice Hannigan said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Si Toma, No Maneje" (If You Drink, Don't Drive) program was established 
in 1989 by the state Office of Traffic Safety. When funds ran out in 1991, the 
not-for-profit Century Council took it over. The council, formed to combat 
alcohol abuse, is funded by beer, wine and liquor businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 According to statistics compiled by the state Department of Justice, there was 
a 16% decline in the number of misdemeanor drunk driving arrests statewide from 
1991 to 1992, reducing the number to 250,235. From 1992 to 1993, arrests were 
further reduced, to 224,935. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Latinos among those arrested declined 7.21% in 1992 -- to 
112,956 -- and 7.26% in 1993, reducing the number to 104,755. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Ann Rasic, director of Hispanic programs for the Century Council, said 
she was pleased that the program's success could be quantified. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is providing the information in Spanish, because we have seen that it 
has been working in the English-speaking segment," Rasic said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also is included in classes in English as a second language in 
more than 400 school districts statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Javier, an ESL teacher at Evans Community Adult School in Los Angeles, 
said incorporating the ramifications of drunk driving into the curriculum on 
life skills makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are skills like writing checks or going into the supermarket," Javier 
said. "We're teaching the students that the ramifications of getting drunk and 
driving are getting arrested, having your car impounded and having your license 
revoked." 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier Flores, executive director of Pueblo y Salud, a social services agency 
in San Fernando, said a 1990 study he conducted found that there were a large 
number of foreign-born Latinos who spoke only Spanish among first-time DUI 
offenders arrested in the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division. 
However, such Latinos made up the smallest percentage of repeat DUI offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That indicates to us that they are coming into the country not knowing the 
law, but once they find out the hard way and learn their lesson, they are not 
doing it again," Flores said.

HUFFINGTON BUSINESS PAST HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein released two new television commercials 
recently that are on the air statewide. Both attack the business credentials of 
Mike Huffington, her Republican opponent for U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ADS: The first commercial pictures newspaper clippings about claims that 
Huffington and his family's former Texas oil and gas company did not properly 
pay California taxes. A narrator reads one charge, attributed to the Sacramento 
Bee, that a subsidiary of Huffco, as the company was known, owes $6.7 million 
in California taxes. As another story is pictured from the San Francisco 
Examiner, a narrator says Huffington avoided California taxes by falsely 
claiming he lived in Texas. The ad then notes that Huffington has declined to 
release his personal income tax returns as it pictures newspaper clippings on 
the issue from the San Francisco Chronicle and Los Angeles Times. Feinstein's 
second ad refers to other allegations against Huffington contained in a Wall 
Street Journal profile. A narrator in the ad, referring to the Journal story, 
says Huffco was fined for violating export laws by selling "shock batons to 
foreign dictators." In another business deal, the ad says, Huffington's company 
defaulted on a $6-million loan to a bank that later failed at a cost to 
taxpayers. Both Feinstein commercials end with the line: "Congressman 
Huffington is a Texas oil millionaire who Californians just can't trust." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: The Feinstein ads are intended to raise suspicions about the 
Republican candidate, especially since polls show that voters still don't know 
him well. They also seek to counter his claim of being a good businessman. The 
ads make four charges about the candidate and his family's company. First, the 
charge that the company owes $6.7 million in California taxes stems from the 
1984 bankruptcy of a Huffington subsidiary that operated a refinery near 
Bakersfield. The state Franchise Tax Board filed a claim for the taxes, but it 
was denied by a judge who said it was too late. Huffington says the company 
should not have owed the taxes because of the multimillion-dollar loss it 
suffered. Second, the charge that Huffington did not pay his California income 
taxes stems from the fact that the candidate and his wife claimed separate 
residences for several years. Huffington said he did not owe California taxes 
because he did not move to the state until 1991, a year after his family's 
Houston oil and gas company was sold. His wife, Arianna, however, had been 
living in the couple's Santa Barbara home since at least 1988. Newspaper 
reports note that the Houston residence offered a savings for Huffington 
because Texas does not have a state income tax and California has one of the 
nation's highest. Third, the charge that Huffington's company improperly sold 
"shock batons" to foreign dictators is based on a U.S. Commerce Department 
complaint in the mid-1980s. The agency fined Huffco $250,000 for violating 
trade restrictions on Indonesia and Singapore -- which both have authoritarian 
governments -- by shipping shock batons and other equipment to the countries. 
Huffington has said he knew of the fine, but not that part of the violation 
involved shock batons. Fourth, a Huffco subsidiary defaulted on a $6-million 
loan to a bank that later failed, leaving taxpayers to bail out depositors. 
Huffington's campaign said that the bank executives bear responsibility for the 
failure and that Huffco also took a substantial loss on the deal.

CRITICS CALL GREEN CARD PLAN CONFUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recently rescinded federal deadline of today for immigrants to apply for new 
green cards has added to widespread uncertainty about the controversial 
requirement that affects more than 1 million people nationwide, immigrant 
advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's rampant confusion all over the place," said Juan Jose Gutierrez, 
executive director of One Stop Immigration, an Eastside social service 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Many remain unaware that the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- reeling 
from an eleventh-hour deluge of applicants -- announced Sept. 2 that the 
deadline was being extended six months, until March 20, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 500,000 immigrants have applied to date, officials say, although 
between 1 million and 1.5 million immigrants nationwide are required to obtain 
new documents or face loss of proof of legal residence. All of those affected 
were issued existing documentation before 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials say they have worked hard to disseminate information about the 
new cutoff date to community agencies, the media and individual immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some confusion, but I wouldn't call it rampant," said Christopher 
Fowler, assistant district director for the INS' huge Los Angeles district, 
which stretches from San Clemente north to San Luis Obispo and east to San 
Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, Fowler said, about 125,000 immigrants residing within the district 
have submitted applications. Overall, Fowler estimated, about 500,000 must get 
new cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS embarked on the ambitious green card replacement program more than two 
years ago in an effort to replace counterfeit-prone paperwork with newer, 
tamper-resistant documents. Current green cards, actually pinkish in color, 
include each bearer's photograph, thumbprint and signature, and are readable by 
agency scanners. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, critics have faulted INS implementation and maintained that 
the program is an unnecessary hardship, particularly on the elderly. Applicants 
must pay a $75 fee.

SENATORS BEGIN WORK ON NEW PRESCRIPTION FOR HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite dwindling hopes for passage of any health care legislation this year, 
a bipartisan group of "mainstream" senators met Monday with Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) to discuss a trimmed-down bill for Congress 
to consider in the final weeks of this session. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell and Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) said afterward that they had made 
progress but still had several difficult issues to resolve before introducing a 
last-resort measure in the Senate. They scheduled another meeting for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), however, said it would take a 
miracle to get any health care legislation through the Senate and House before 
Congress quits for the year in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), a leader of the moderate group of senators, 
quipped that it may be time to call in former President Jimmy Carter at the 
eleventh hour to try to salvage a health care bill, just as Carter succeeded in 
last-minute negotiations in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's attempts to produce a compromise bill have been attacked from both 
the Republican right and the Democratic left. Some senators, such as Phil Gramm 
(R-Tex.), want to drop the subject of health care while others, such as Paul 
Wellstone (D-Minn.), have argued against a compromise of basic principles just 
to get a bill passed this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some hope, but not the same hope as I had last week," said Sen. Dave 
Durenberger (R-Minn.), another moderate seeking to reach agreement with 
Mitchell on health care. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mitchell and Chafee told reporters that they have resolved 90% of the 
issues that once divided them and are working on the others, including such 
difficult points as long-term care, prescription drug coverage and the size of 
companies that would be allowed to insure themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize the very tight time constraints," Mitchell added. "We're moving 
as fast as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said the agreement reached in Haiti that staved off an American 
invasion helped the cause of health care because the agreement will reduce the 
amount of time Congress planned to use to debate President Clinton's Haiti 
policy.

PILOTS' REACTION TO WIND-SHEAR ALERT QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Documents filed in the investigation of the USAir crash here last July raise 
questions about the response of the pilots to a wind-shear condition that 
apparently hurled the DC-9 to the ground, killing 37 of the 57 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 While mystery still shrouds the causes of the more recent USAir crash in 
Pittsburgh, Pa., that claimed 132 lives, sources close to the probe here say 
investigators are all but certain that a powerful thunderstorm -- and the 
violent winds that it spawned -- was the major factor in the Charlotte crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Still uncertain, however, is how well the cockpit crew -- pilot Michael 
Greenlee, 38, and co-pilot James Phillip Hayes, 41 -- reacted to the growing 
emergency as Flight 1016 prepared to land at Charlotte-Douglas International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions also have arisen whether air traffic controllers adequately relayed 
information about the worsening weather to the cockpit crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Greenlee and Hayes survived the crash and are scheduled to testify today 
at the National Transportation Safety Board hearings that began here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to investigators' reports, Hayes was at the controls as the jetliner 
descended toward Charlotte after a 31-minute flight from Columbia, S.C.  
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service meteorologists testified Monday that there were major 
thunderstorms in the area at the time, but an air traffic controller at the 
airport then testified that none of these storms seemed to pose a special 
hazard to any particular flight. 
</P>
<P>
 A weather message broadcast by the airport tower to all planes in the area at 
6:23 p.m. made no mention of the thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Line Pilots Assn. argued Monday that the cockpit crew was not aware of 
any impending problems, but the cockpit voice recorder suggests otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hayes noted the heavy rain they were encountering, Greenlee told Hayes 
that they might have to abort the landing and fly a right-turn "go-around" for 
a second attempt. Hayes agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenlee then said there was "a chance of a shear." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to the possibility of wind shear -- a sudden shift in the 
direction and velocity of localized gusts. 
</P>
<P>
 A particularly dangerous form of wind shear is a microburst -- a violent 
downdraft in the center of a thunderstorm. A plane flying through a microburst 
near the ground first encounters strong head winds; then strong tail winds 
deprive it of the lift needed to keep it aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 That, investigators say, is apparently what happened to Flight 1016. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:40 p.m., the airport control tower issued a warning: "Wind shear alert." 
The dangerous winds were reported to the right of Flight 1016. The warning was 
repeated 12 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
 Two planes on the ground elected to delay their takeoffs, but Greenlee and 
Hayes continued their approach. 
</P>
<P>
 As the DC-9 hurtled into the storm, sensors in the cockpit and on the ground 
indicated that strong tail winds from the microburst began affecting the craft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take it around, go to the right!" Greenlee ordered. "Max power!" 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, as yet unexplained, Greenlee then ordered Hayes to "push it 
down," apparently telling his co-pilot to lower the plane's nose -- an 
unorthodox procedure in either a go-around or a wind-shear situation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to investigators, Hayes applied full power, but he also raised the 
nose -- standard procedure in such circumstances. The plane, which was 
beginning a turn to the right, rose a little, then started to sink again. 
</P>
<P>
 In another unorthodox move, Greenlee then placed his hand over Hayes' on the 
throttles, attempting to take over the controls without telling Hayes that he 
was doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Each pilot later claimed to have been in control of the plane, raising the 
specter that there was confusion in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that "both pilots described feeling as though the aircraft 
had dropped out from under them." 
</P>
<P>
 The plane slammed into the ground about 2,200 feet to the right of the runway, 
carving a 1,100-foot swath through a grove of trees before breaking up and 
bursting into flame.

AFTER A HOT YEAR, ICE BEER SALES SHOW NO SIGNS OF COOLING DOWN; ALCOHOL: NEW 
BREW WILL ACCOUNT FOR 5% OF ALL SALES THIS YEAR, BUT SOME WORRY THAT NOVELTY 
WILL WEAR OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ice beers are creating some waves in the brewing business. 
</P>
<P>
 They surfaced domestically for the first time a year ago. An estimated 35 ice 
beer brands are now available. Nearly every major brewer, including 
heavyweights Anheuser-Busch Inc. and Miller Brewing Co., is involved. Millions 
of dollars of advertising go into promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry watchers estimate that ice beer, which gets its name from a 
distinctive wrinkle in the brewing process, will account for a healthy 5% of 
all beer shipped this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But some say a shakeout is inevitable. The rush to market may only reflect 
industrywide yearning for growth. It raises the question of whether ice beer 
will have only short-lived popularity the way dry beer had a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of ice beer has also worried groups advocating moderation 
because many ice beer brands have proportionately more alcohol than regular 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the category's long-range prospects, the brewing industry is 
relishing the excitement that ice beer is creating. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers spent about $45 billion on beer last year. But sales volume has 
drifted in a narrow range for a decade as baby boomers aged, consumers turned 
health-conscious and awareness grew of the dangers of drinking and driving. 
Some analysts said ice beer could lift overall sales volume this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still early but we are very optimistic about what we are seeing so 
far," said Rob Olejniczak, who oversees Lite Ice for Miller, the nation's 
second-biggest brewer. Miller distributes three other ice beers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be a fad," said Michael LaBroad, manager for the category 
leader Ice Draft from Budweiser at Anheuser-Busch. "The natural image of ice 
and beer is very simple and easily understood by consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ice beer migrated from Canada, where it is said to have captured nearly 10% of 
the market last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Beer marketers say the first sold here was Molson Ice, imported by 
Miller-owned Molson Breweries USA of Reston, Va. It arrived last August and 
remains among the five top-selling ice brands. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice beer's main attribute is said to be smoother taste. The higher alcohol 
content in some versions -- typically 5.6% as compared to 5% for regular beer 
-- appeals to some consumers, but brewers can't tout that feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice beer is created when its temperature is lowered during brewing so ice 
crystals form. That alone is said to alter the beer's taste. Some brewers 
filter out the crystals, boosting the proportion of alcohol and further 
altering the taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Walters, a veteran industry watcher, said ice beer sales will help the 
overall market grow by about 1% this year after a 0.2% rise last year. He said 
without ice beer, the market would be flat to lower.

TAKING AIM AT GUN MAKER; PROTEST: DEMONSTRATORS SEEK TO DRAW ATTENTION TO 
IRVINE FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Holding brown teddy bears and signs that said "Cease Fire" and "The Killing 
Starts Here," 20 medical students from UC Irvine and other protesters held a 
vigil Monday outside Bryco Arms, the Irvine manufacturer of inexpensive 
"Saturday night special" handguns used in many street crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Parfrey, director of Physicians for Social Responsibility in Los 
Angeles, said the purpose of the early morning gathering was to draw the 
attention of Irvine residents to the fact that the guns are made here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teddy bears we're all holding today have to pass through more regulations 
and more tests than these guns," Parfrey said, noting that "you can't take out 
(the teddy bears' eyes), or children might swallow them. Prescription 
dispensers, the plastic things you get at the pharmacy, are more childproof 
than a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is, these guns aren't sufficiently regulated, and there's no 
standard for determining their . . . safety." 
</P>
<P>
 A plant manager, who refused to give his name, said the students and doctors 
"were lost" and protesting outside the wrong building -- although the Violence 
Policy Center in Washington and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms both list 17692 Cowan Ave., where the protesters gathered, as the 
address of Bryco Arms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't manufacture guns," the plant manager said. "We're a hobby shop. We 
restore hot rods. And I've got a good mind to call police because these people 
are holding an illegal assembly." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unknown whether he made good on his threat to call police, but he did 
turn on the front lawn sprinkler system, which doused some of the protesters 
and prompted them to move farther away from the property. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 1992 report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 
Bryco Arms manufactured 204,883 pistols. In 1991, it led all other U. S. 
manufacturers in pistol production, turning out 202,510 handguns, according to 
the February, 1994, edition of "Cease Fire," a publication of the Violence 
Policy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no signs identifying the business outside the brown two-story 
building in Irvine, and neither George nor Bruce Jennings, identified as 
Bryco's owners, could be reached for comment, although messages were left. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were doing a socially worthy endeavor, they'd announce their 
presence," said Robert Wesley, co-president of Physicians for Social 
Responsibility. "But they know what they do is inherently dangerous and causes 
death and destruction, and that's why they try to make their location secret." 
</P>
<P>
 Four members of the Orange County Catholic Workers also took part in the 
protest of the pistol manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the guns that come from here wind up in the streets of Santa Ana, 
where I live," said Tabeo Saenz. "We hear gunshots in my neighborhood on a 
nightly basis." Joe Basile, another Santa Ana resident, said there are some 
parts of the city where he refuses to venture, especially at night, when he can 
hear the distinct "boom, boom" of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you think, 'Is that a car backfiring?' But you know it isn't; you 
know there are guns going off," said Basile, a member of the Catholic Workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Patterson, another protester who works in the trauma center at St. 
Mary's Medical Center in Long Beach, explained his presence by saying that he 
has seen "quite a few victims" of small handguns, judging by the size of the 
bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Felix Aguilar, a medical student at UC Irvine, the protest wasn't so 
much directed at Saturday night specials and Bryco Arms as it was in favor of 
gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say we have the right to bear arms under the Second 
Amendment, and that's why we're here -- we've got bears who have arms," he 
said, pointing to the protesters' teddy bears, whose fur was made from 
flame-retardant and hypoallergenic materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the bears have any problems, they're taken off the shelves in a second," 
said Anna Jimenez, adding, "Why can't we do that with firearms?"

WOMAN IN TORTURE CASE TERMED INSANE; PROSECUTION: HER LAWYER CONTENDS THAT SHE 
WAS NOT ABLE TO ACT RATIONALLY AT THE TIME HER NEPHEW WAS ABUSED. HE SAYS SHE 
INSISTS THAT THE BOY'S INTERNAL INJURIES RESULTED FROM A 'FREAK ACCIDENT.' 
</P>

<P>
 An Orange woman charged with torturing her 10-year-old nephew was insane when 
she administered some of the abuse, but insists the internal injuries the child 
suffered were the result of a "freak accident," her attorney said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Medina, 31, has lapsed into a deep depression and remains under a 
suicide watch at the County Jail, where she is being held in protective 
custody, said defense attorney Richard C. Gilbert. Sources said the Medina case 
has been widely discussed among jail inmates and officials fear for her safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is very, very depressed and her heart is completely filled with sorrow 
and remorse for everything that has happened," Gilbert said. "I believe she was 
insane at the time and she simply snapped and lost the ability to act like a 
rational human being. Only an insane person could have committed these horrible 
acts." 
</P>
<P>
 Medina is scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 30 in Municipal Court in Santa Ana 
on four felony charges of child abuse and one felony charge of torture. Her 
case is the first in which the state's 4-year-old torture law has been used in 
Orange County. Gilbert said his client may plead not guilty by reason of 
insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina is accused of searing her nephew's tongue with hot knives, beating him 
with an electrical cord and anally penetrating him with a souvenir baseball 
bat. The boy's internal injuries were so severe that doctors had to perform a 
colostomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the former elementary school playground supervisor abused the 
boy over the past year, but administered the most severe assault on Sept. 7. 
They say Medina attacked the boy because he was playing with her marijuana 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has also raised questions about whether a physician acted quickly 
enough to report suspected abuse after examining the boy on Sept. 8. Social 
workers, investigating the report filed later that day, sought emergency 
medical treatment for the boy, who remains hospitalized in good condition. 
Authorities say the child nearly died of his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Charles J. Middleton declined to comment on Gilbert's statements 
Monday but said he had never seen a defense attorney "grasp at straws" so early 
in a case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said Monday that his client is being unfairly portrayed by law 
enforcement and the media as a monster. He said Medina never intended to harm 
the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina acknowledges that because the child was in her care, she is ultimately 
responsible for his welfare, Gilbert said. But she disputes many of the 
allegations made by authorities, he said. According to Medina, the boy's 
internal injuries were the result of a freak accident, Gilbert added. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was being paddled with this miniature bat and he was trying to push her 
away from him and there was a struggle," Gilbert said. "They fell and the bat 
inadvertently, by accident, went into the child's rectum as she was paddling 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said the boy's initial report to authorities corroborated this 
version. Gilbert said he is concerned that "well-meaning people" who are giving 
the boy gifts in the hospital may be inadvertently causing him to change his 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Medina also disputes reports that she heated up knives on a stove top before 
sticking the red-hot metal to the boy's tongue, Gilbert said. According to 
Gilbert, Medina contends that those burns occurred when the boy grabbed a 
heated spatula she was using to scrape ice from her freezer and put it in his 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said he plans to challenge the torture law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in any way downplaying the injuries in this case, but there have been 
other cases involving serious injuries over the last few years and torture was 
never charged," he said. "The law is so poorly written that almost any case 
involving child abuse can be charged as torture." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said he also questions whether public policy may have influenced his 
client, noting that Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) authored an 
unsuccessful bill this year to require paddling of youths convicted of painting 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when her own public official tells her it's appropriate to cane 
children and you have someone who is susceptible to mental disease, that's how 
these kinds of events can take place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy took offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "My bill addresses judicial discipline in an open court," Conroy said in a 
prepared statement. "This (Gilbert's remarks) shows to what lengths some 
attorneys will go to excuse any action, including torture."

COUNCIL HEAPS CRITICISM ON LANDFILL PLAN; DISPUTE: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
OFFICIALS SAY COUNTY'S EXPANSION DESIGNS FOR PRIMA DESHECHA WOULD LEAVE GARBAGE 
PILED 80 FEET ABOVE A RIDGELINE. THEY WILL VOTE TONIGHT ON RESOLUTION OBJECTING 
TO DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are fighting mad about a county proposal to pile trash in the 
Prima Deshecha Landfill 80 feet above a ridgeline, which would create a 
4,500-foot-long plateau in place of the natural silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way," Councilman Gil Jones said Monday. "I don't want the ridgeline 
altered. We worked too hard to have them preserved. It's just not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Collene Campbell believes the City Council will agree unanimously "to 
fight this every step of the way."  
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to vote tonight on a resolution that expresses its 
objections to the county's draft environmental report on plans to modernize the 
landfill. The city contends the county wants to expand the landfill and the 
report does not cover problems that would result from such growth. County 
officials, however, say a larger landfill is already authorized and that the 
report covers how that would be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, council members say the county's draft environmental 
report doesn't adequately deal with the increase in truck traffic on Ortega 
Highway that would accompany expanded use of the 1,530-acre landfill site. 
</P>
<P>
 But their greatest concern is with the portion of proposed expansion that 
would make part of the landfill operation visible to residents from the north. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's General Plan calls for protecting ridgelines, and officials here 
proudly point out that some surrounding cities have been lax when it comes to 
looking out for hilltops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the county would want to cooperate with the city's General Plan," 
Campbell said. "I fully expect the county to take another look at it, and 
that's what we are hoping for." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said the city sent a letter Friday to Supervisor Thomas F. Riley -- 
whose district includes the landfill -- asking for his help in revising part of 
the environmental report before the plan goes before the Board of Supervisors 
in December.  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Blanchard, executive assistant to Riley, said he had not yet seen the 
city's letter, but added, "We will seriously consider the city's concerns and 
try to address them." 
</P>
<P>
 The county landfill, south of Ortega Highway and east of Interstate 5, has 
been in use since 1976, handling municipal solid wastes from South County 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the landfill's site -- 570 acres -- is in the city of San 
Juan Capistrano, while 133 acres are in San Clemente and the remaining acreage 
on unincorporated county land. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 1,500 tons of rubbish daily is being sent to the landfill and, under the 
county proposal, the amount could rise to 4,000 tons per day, creating more 
noise and traffic on Ortega Highway, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 They contend that more roadways should connect to the landfill from the south 
or north. Now, Ortega Highway is the only major access to the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what sort of impacts these trucks have," said Jones, who lives near a 
dump truck storage yard in the Los Rios District. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Fish, a spokeswoman with the county's Integrated Waste Management 
agency, said the increase in the landfill's use would not necessitate the 
county getting additional permits, because the landfill already has been 
authorized to accept up to 4,000 tons of garbage per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Tomlinson, the city's director of planning, said it is an expansion, with 
the county's plan outlining how it will add 53 years of life to the landfill by 
increasing its capacity 22-million tons. 
</P>
<P>
 George Britton, manager of project planning with the county's Environmental 
Management Agency, said the county will respond fully to comments on the draft 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 Britton said the report also addresses the development of a portion of the 
site as a regional park and the alignment of La Pata Avenue from San Juan 
Capistrano to San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jones said he fears that county officials may have more in mind than 
just handling trash from South County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing they will want to do is import trash from San Diego and Los 
Angeles," Jones said. "They are expanding the volume of it. It flies in the 
face of these people doing the recycling and trying to reduce the flow."

 Campbell said she visited the landfill site recently and saw a trash hauler 
from San Diego pull in.

 "I don't think South County should be the receptacle for everybody's trash, 
and I don't think the citizens want them to be either," she said.

PICTURING A BETTER CITY; PAINTBRUSHES IN HAND, SANTA ANA YOUTHS DEPICT POSITIVE 
SIDE OF COMMUNITY

 With a small brush dripping with green paint, Miguel Ornelas dabbed color onto 
a 25-foot mural depicting children waving flags and walking proudly through the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, about a dozen other at-risk youngsters, ages 9 to 15, worked on other 
portions of the mural, creating a public work of art as part of Safe Haven, a 
federally funded "Weed-and-Seed" program designed to keep children out of gangs 
by offering alternative activities such as art classes, camping trips and 
tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
 During a break from his work, Miguel, 17, admired the painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to feel proud, of course, in taking part in something that everyone 
is going to see," he said. "It's a positive outlook on things. I want people to 
see the positive side of Santa Ana and the the community." 
</P>
<P>
 He praised the program as a crucial alternative for youngsters who might 
otherwise join gangs, one that inspires them and offers challenging and 
creative activities. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program did not exist, more children would probably drift into gangs, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the odds would be pretty high. They would have nothing else to do but 
hang out on the streets and do the gang activities. They wouldn't have anything 
else to do and they wouldn't have people to look out for them and tell them 
what's wrong and what's right," Miguel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths who are at risk for gang involvement work side by side with their peers 
who act as role models. Mario Bustos, Santa Ana High School student body 
president, was a mentor during the mural project. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids from the program come from gang-infested neighborhoods. 
We're just here to help them out and be positive role models," said Jesse Soto, 
a spokesman for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell them you don't have to get involved in gangs, you don't have to do 
those drugs. Maybe when they grow up they can come back and be positive role 
models for the other kids growing up in the neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe Haven, which is funded by a $75,000 federal grant, also provides children 
opportunities for trips and to get tutoring. On Thursday, several youngsters 
took a three-day trip to UC Berkeley that was designed to get them planning for 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto said the program also encourages youngsters to meet and make friends with 
others from throughout the city, Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids are from different neighborhoods. If this program was not 
here, they wouldn't be doing stuff together -- they'd be fighting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, this group of youngsters worked for several hours to complete the 
mural, which is on a wall on the southeast corner of Chestnut Avenue and Raitt 
Street. Neighbors watched appreciatively as the children's work progressed, 
saying the mural would probably deter graffiti vandals who had defaced the wall 
as frequently as twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Several motorists slowed to view the work, many honking and waving their 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Alma Nuenez, 13, said she has enjoyed her three months in the program and 
relished the chance to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel proud because I never have done this before," she said, referring to 
the mural painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto said he hopes the mural project would prompt similar works throughout the 
city. Public art would deter graffiti and show graffiti vandals there is a more 
positive mode of expression available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to know that Santa Ana is a beautiful city. It's not just 
gangs and drugs," he said.

FUMES SEND 60 STUDENTS TO HOSPITALS; SCHOOL: FIREWORKS SET OFF IN BATHROOM MAY 
HAVE FILTERED THROUGH AIR VENTS, OFFICIALS SAY. MANY CASES MAY BE 
PSYCHOSOMATIC.

 More than 60 elementary school students were rushed to local hospitals Monday 
complaining of nausea from fumes blamed on fireworks set off in the boys' 
bathroom, but fire officials reckoned that many of the children were suffering 
from psychosomatic pains. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County firefighters and a hazardous materials crew were called to 
Lincoln Elementary School when administrators reported that students were 
complaining of stomachaches, burning in their noses and throats, and chest 
pains from fumes coming out of air-conditioning ducts. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Inspector Lee Gregory said the fumes apparently came from 
fireworks set off in a bathroom with air-conditioning vents connected to some 
classrooms. No spent fireworks debris was found, but the remains may have been 
flushed down a toilet, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the students did turn over to the principal an inch-thick firecracker 
called a "ground bloom," saying he found it near the area of the boys' 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident may have begun when some children who were unusually sensitive, 
because of asthma or allergies or because they sat very close to the vents, 
began feeling the effects of the fumes, and that scared the other children, 
said Fire Capt. Ronald Hayton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen this many times before," he said. "There is a hysteria involved 
-- one person gets ill, then the other psychosomatically starts to feel sick 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dealing with young kids here," said Hayton. "If they see their friends 
getting sick, it hurts their feelings and then they feel genuinely sick too." 
</P>
<P>
 Before firefighters arrived, an announcement to evacuate the school in the 
44000 block of 15th Street East came over the public-address system, which 
several children said sent them and their classmates running from the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the science lab and everybody just started running out of the 
school," said 8-year-old Charles Nero, who is in the third grade. "I just ran 
outside and then my head started hurting and I couldn't breathe very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-grader Eric Tores, 11, was one of the children most seriously affected 
by the fumes. Eric said he passed out after he stuck his head into the bathroom 
right before recess ended and smelled the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a strong whiff and then I went back out and I felt fine," Eric 
explained. But by the time he lined up with classmates to go back into the 
classroom, "I started falling and people had to carry me. Then I started 
feeling sleepy and I started having trouble breathing."  
</P>
<P>
 Eric was taken to Desert Palms Community Hospital, where he was given an 
oxygen tank to ease his breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten children were transported by ambulance and 52 others were loaded onto a 
bus and taken to Desert Palms, Lancaster Community Hospital and Antelope Valley 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 At Antelope Valley Hospital, eight children were admitted to the emergency 
room, where they were treated and released for stomachaches and chest pains, 
according to hospital spokesman Gary Cothran. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert Palms Hospital spokeswoman Kathy McCain said about 10 students 
complaining of a burning sensation in their throats and coughing were treated 
there and released. Five of the most seriously affected children were taken to 
Lancaster Community Hospital, where they were given oxygen and released, said 
hospital spokeswoman Carol Fryer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln School Principal Alyce Ellis said that "if I find out who the student 
was (who set off fireworks), they will be expelled." 
</P>
<P>
 A school assembly will be held today to discuss the matter, she said.

ALZHEIMER'S VICTIM SOUGHT; MISSING 3 WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John F. Ward is an avid hiker and nature lover who could still scramble up a 
crooked mountain trail with the best of them, even after Alzheimer's disease 
began to whittle away his memory about 5 1/2 years ago, according to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 31, the retired civil servant, over objections from his wife, walked 
out of the house on a six-mile trek from his home in the 20000 block of Lassen 
Street to the Big 5 sporting goods store on Topanga Canyon Boulevard to buy a 
new pair of hiking shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to drive him there, but he is a big guy, and I couldn't stop him 
from leaving," said Simone Ward, his wife of 45 years. "He knew his world was 
shrinking. He knew he could get lost, but that wasn't a deterrent for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, 68, never made it to the store, and except for one possible sighting, he 
has not been seen or heard from since he left his home that afternoon, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we ever get him back, we will never let him out of our sight again, that's 
for sure," Simone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he disappeared, Simone Ward has tried everything she could think of to 
try to find him -- from posting 1,500 flyers across communities in the west San 
Fernando Valley to renting a helicopter to conduct her own airborne search of 
the hills to climbing into her own car and traveling the rugged fire roads of 
Brown's Canyon, in the Santa Susana Mountains north of the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's sons also have led volunteer searches into the canyon on several 
occasions to find their father, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, when the case received some notice in the news media, the LAPD's 
Devonshire station received a flurry of phone calls about possible sightings, 
but those have tailed off to nothing, said Officer Bill Wallach. 
</P>
<P>
 To complicate matters, an equestrian who may have seen Ward provided 
information to the Police Department that was not acted on until six days 
later, when the missing persons detective assigned to the case returned from 
vacation to find a note on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Detective Alex Valadez acknowledges the delay in responding 
to the information, but says that the witness information isn't as reliable as 
Simone Ward would like to believe and that he's done everything in his power to 
locate the missing man. 
</P>
<P>
 The rider described the man she saw sleeping next to a path in Brown's Canyon 
on Sept. 1, Valadez said. He wore an aqua blue sweat shirt and khaki shorts, 
which matched the description of the clothes John Ward was wearing when he left 
his home, but she couldn't remember whether the man was bearded. 
</P>
<P>
 "She thought it was a bit strange, but she said, 'Hi, how are you doing?' " as 
she approached the man, Valadez said. "The man said, 'Fine,' and she rode on." 
She thought he was just a hiker taking a nap, Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The detective spent the next three days after he got the note combing the 
canyon on foot, with search and rescue teams and canine teams, contacting 
ranchers to let them know about Ward's disappearance. One night, authorities 
used helicopters equipped with a night vision apparatus to scour the hillsides 
for any sign of the missing man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize that this is something the family wants us to do more on, but 
sometimes you reach a point of 'Where do you go from here?' " Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time that John Ward has wandered away from his home, but 
it is only the second time he has wandered away for more than just a few hours, 
his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, who at 6 feet, 2 inches and 210 pounds, is still a strong, healthy man 
despite having Alzheimer's, disappeared about a year ago. By the time 
authorities found him, he had walked 25 miles to Magic Mountain, presumably 
down Malibu Canyon Road, in about 19 hours, Simone Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could walk four miles in one hour without any problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, Simone drove 200 miles to Cambria, where the couple own a summer 
home, on the outside chance that he might have gone there. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he was stricken with the disease, Simone Ward said, her husband has 
wandered away from the house about eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like unlearning," she said, explaining his disease. "There have been 
times when I have asked him to water the back yard, and he would have to ask, 
'Where's the back yard?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Simone has had help besides the Police Department in the search for her 
missing husband, and she is grateful for all of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills printer who took her order for flyers ran off the first 
1,000 free of charge, she said. And the Van Nuys Airport helicopter service 
tore up a check for almost $700 after she chartered the aircraft to search the 
canyon for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been so many people. . . . They kinda get you going when you're 
down on your hope," she said. "They kinda spur you on."

COMMITTEE BACKS LOAN TO REBUILD APARTMENTS FOR POOR TENANTS; HOUSING: CITY 
PANEL TENTATIVELY APPROVES $900,000 FOR AGENCY TO ACQUIRE QUAKE-RAVAGED 
STRUCTURE IN RESEDA 'GHOST TOWN,' SALVAGING AFFORDABLE UNITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Taking a new tack to rebuild the most vulnerable of quake "ghost town" 
buildings, a Los Angeles housing panel tentatively approved a $900,000 loan 
Monday to restore a crumbling Reseda apartment complex for low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 City housing officials say the loan is the first of its kind, aimed at 
increasing low-income housing by salvaging financially troubled buildings, 
primarily within the 15 designated ghost towns. Those structures would 
otherwise sit neglected for months, perhaps years, attracting graffiti, crime 
and vermin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to encourage the nonprofits to come out and eat these 
properties up," said Beth Bergman, a finance officer for the city's Housing 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan, which was approved by the City Council's Housing and Community 
Redevelopment Committee, would provide enough money for the Los Angeles 
Community Design Center to buy the severely damaged 64-unit apartment building 
at 7939 Reseda Blvd. The nonprofit group has also requested a second loan for 
about $600,000 to rehabilitate the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire council must still give both loans final approval, but no 
opposition is anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, red-tagged to indicate it is uninhabitable, is located in the 
middle of a chain of vacant, quake-damaged structures along Reseda Boulevard 
and is already in foreclosure. It shifted off its foundation during the 
Northridge earthquake and is now leaning noticeably, although a "Now Renting" 
sign remains on its front facade. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing officials say they are not sure how many damaged buildings may be 
turned into low-income housing projects, but they hope the strategy will save 
at least some of the hundreds of vacant apartment complexes that have become 
magnets for blight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of a long-term strategy," Bergman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the loan plan, the Los Angeles Community Design Center will redesign the 
buildings, reducing the number of units to 46 to allow for bigger apartments to 
house larger families.  
</P>
<P>
 The three-bedroom units will rent for as little as $338, and the four-bedroom 
apartments from $365, said Anne Sewill, executive director of the design 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the building is restored -- perhaps in about a year -- the center will 
retain ownership of the property but plans to hire a management firm to operate 
the complex, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewill said that before the quake, many low-income families lived in 
apartments in the Reseda neighborhood, but they were forced to double up in 
small units because they could not otherwise afford the rents. 
</P>
<P>
 By making the units larger and reducing the rents, she said, the building will 
allow poor families to return to the neighborhood and live more comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewill said her group has already begun negotiations to buy and restore other 
quake-damaged buildings in the neighborhood and in other ghost towns throughout 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents Reseda, said she supports 
the loan proposal because the property might otherwise sit idle for months 
without repairs or be sold to an absentee landlord who might repair the 
building but fail to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Bernstein, Chick's planning deputy, called the Los Angeles Community 
Design Center a "top quality" developer and added that low-income housing is 
badly needed in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a need everywhere in the city for quality low-income housing," he 
said.

WORKER LOSES 3 FINGERS IN RESTAURANT ACCIDENT; SAFETY: STATE INVESTIGATING EL 
TORITO GRILL MISHAP IN WHICH EMPLOYEE'S HAND WAS SMASHED IN TORTILLA PRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cal/OSHA is investigating an accident at the El Torito Grill at Fashion Island 
in which a 24-year-old employee lost three fingers after his hand became stuck 
in a tortilla-making machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the incident happened Sept. 12, the state's industrial safety agency 
wasn't informed until Monday, prompting one official to say the restaurant may 
have violated state law requiring serious accidents to be reported within 48 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvaro Rivas of Santa Ana, a restaurant employee for nearly eight years, said 
in an interview from his hospital bed Monday that he was making tortillas for 
the lunch hour when the machine's press slammed down on his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine is dangerous, Rivas contended, because it lacks safety bars that 
would have prevented his hand from getting caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers tried to get his hand out but the machine had no emergency release 
buttons, he said. By the time his hand was removed from the machine, which 
combines a tortilla press and rotating 400-degree oven, his fingers were 
smashed and burned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was yelling and screaming," Rivas said. "I was in such pain." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the restaurant manager called 911 and Rivas was rushed to Hoag 
Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, where doctors on Friday removed the middle, 
ring and little fingers of his left hand. Skin taken from his abdomen was 
grafted to his palm, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first mishap at the restaurant. On Aug. 1, 1993, a water tank 
exploded, killing one employee and injuring five others. The Cal/OSHA fined El 
Torito restaurants $5,000 because the tank had a valve missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Casey, chief financial officer for Family Restaurants Inc., the parent 
corporation of El Torito restaurants, admitted no fault Monday but said the 
company intends to examine the machine and to "make changes . . . to make it 
safer than it is today." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Brown, Cal/OSHA's district manager in Santa Ana, said the mishap is under 
investigation and that the company didn't report the accident until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company is supposed to report to Cal/OSHA an accident within 48 hours," 
said Brown. "Failing to report an accident is a violation of (state) law." 
</P>
<P>
 Employers are required to report serious injury accidents. The state's 
definition of serious is an injury for which a worker is hospitalized for more 
than 24 hours for more than observation, or an injury that results in death or 
permanent disfigurement, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey said, "we didn't report (the accident) until today because we weren't 
sure of the extent of injuries until today. The man had surgery on Friday and 
to make sure, we needed to wait until it was an injury to the extent that it 
required a Cal/OSHA reporting." 
</P>
<P>
 Casey described Rivas as a "good employee." Rivas was employee of the month 
for August and was coach of the restaurant's soccer team, Casey said.

Q & A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange Unified School District Supt. Robert L. French 
</P>
<P>
 "Troubled" and "dysfunctional" are the words critics use to describe the 
Orange Unified School District.  
</P>
<P>
 Scandals have plagued the 26,000-student district and its Board of Education 
since the 1980s. A bid- rigging scheme was followed by strikes, budget 
deficits, pay cuts, sexual harassment charges and a revolving door of 
superintendents.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the school board hired Robert L. French as the district's first 
permanent superintendent in two years. French, a 63-year-old career educator, 
was interviewed by Times correspondent Lesley Wright.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Given the district's history, why would you want this job? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I always thought Orange was way beyond most (districts) in the county. They 
were accomplishing so much. . . . Unfortunately, they went through some 
scandalous times, if you want to label it that. . . . It isn't good for the 
community, isn't good for the schools, isn't good for education. Let's put 
those in the past and move ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 We do have an outstanding staff, a very good board (and) . . . an excellent 
community. Education is important to the parents in this community. That's what 
makes it rewarding. I very quickly have learned that I have outstanding 
principals -- real leaders -- and teachers that are just ready to do all kinds 
of things. . . . That's exciting; that's rewarding. There are challenges here, 
but I'm not looking for an easy road. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Morale among the teachers and staff is low. How can you address that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's one of the major objectives (for me) personally . . . (and) the 
board also. We have to do something about teachers' salaries -- at least to 
bring them up to the county average. We'll be able to address very soon some 
ways to do that. We hired some outstanding principals this year, but we lost 
some outstanding ones, too. And salary was (a) factor. I want to be able to 
encourage our teachers to stay and to attract new teachers. . . . It's a great 
place to be a teacher. Salary is a negative part, and we need to address that 
and, hopefully, we can resolve it in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have an educational philosophy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I guess it is, basically, (that) all kids can learn.  
</P>
<P>
 So often I've used a diagram when I talk with groups -- kind of an educational 
philosophy. It's a triangle. I put at the base the home -- that is the basis. 
On one side I put the community. On the other side I put the schools. Put the 
child in the center of the triangle -- the triangle being the strongest 
geometric form. If any one side of that triangle is weak, the triangle will 
collapse, and the child is in the middle, remember. So we have to build all 
three.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; COUNCIL WON'T OK RENT HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Council members have refused to approve 7% rent increases for "affordable 
housing" apartments subsidized by the federal government, but they are 
powerless to prevent the increases from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some of the rent hikes had already been imposed by the time council 
members reviewed documents last week from the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development.When coupled with last year's rent hikes, the increases total 
nearly 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 The higher rents were based on a 1994 median income of $58,800 in Orange 
County, as determined by the federal housing department. But critics of the 
rent hikes question the HUD figures, pointing out that Chapman University has 
calculated this year's median income at $54,413. 
</P>
<P>
 A family of four earning less than 50% of the median income will pay a maximum 
$735 a month for a three-bedroom apartment under the new HUD guidelines. Using 
the Chapman University figures, the maximum rent for the same family would 
total $680 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt seriously the accuracy of those HUD figures," said Councilman Greg 
Smith. "I would hope that in the future, those landlords are sensitive to the 
fact that those figures don't really represent reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the City Council unanimously agreed to not adopt a resolution 
accepting the new HUD guidelines, the council cannot roll back the rent 
increase. The HUD apartments are owned and maintained by Irvine Apartment 
Communities, a publicly owned company that oversees 13,541 apartments in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has no jurisdiction," said Councilman Barry J. Hammond. "It's an 
issue between the landlord and the tenant. By taking no action, we are stating 
to the property owners that we'd like them to reconsider their position."RUSS

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; TEACHERS GET INTO SPIRIT OF UNIFORM LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not only do the students at Mulholland Middle School in Van Nuys abide by a 
uniform policy, so do the teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 This semester marks the middle school's first attempt at enforcing a dress 
code and uniform policy in which youngsters are required to replace their baggy 
pants and daisy dukes with white or powder-blue collared shirts with navy 
slacks, skirts or shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 To promote the policy, most of the faculty and staff have purchased clothing 
for themselves in the designated color scheme of the uniforms, which are 
imprinted with the school's insignia.  
</P>
<P>
 "Uniforms are a learning tool," said Principal Alfredo Tarin, who tries to 
wear white and blue outfits to school every day. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of faculty and students have purchased the uniforms so far, said 
teacher Annick Draghi, who also wears the uniform. Some are still waiting for 
their uniforms to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very positive thing that makes the focus on academics," Draghi 
said. "They see that it really does look good; it looks nice on the teachers; 
it looks nice on the students."  
</P>
<P>
 "I wear mine just about every day," said special education instructor Allen 
McDaniel, who makes a point of complimenting the students when he sees them 
wearing the uniforms. "I do it to show the kids that it's cool, that it's not 
all that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel said he has seen students checking out their peers to see if they are 
wearing the uniforms, and slowly warming up to the idea. "I think they are 
getting into it," he said. MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; 'COWBOY BANDIT' SOUGHT IN 5TH HEIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bank robber known as the "Stetson Bandit" or "Cowboy Bandit" has struck 
again, robbing an Eagle Rock bank Monday, police said. But they added that he 
may have been foiled in an attempted heist because a bank teller recognized 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, who was already being sought in four Glendale-area robberies, was 
seen standing in line Friday afternoon at Home Savings, 620 N. Brand Blvd. A 
teller alerted the bank's manager after recognizing the man from a picture in a 
pamphlet distributed by police to local banks. The man disappeared before 
police could be summoned. 
</P>
<P>
 A short while later, a man matching the suspect's description robbed a Bank of 
America branch in nearby Eagle Rock, escaping with an unknown amount of cash, 
said Glendale Police Agent Rod Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "At both Home Savings and the Bank of America, the description we received 
from witnesses was the same, a white male with brown hair," Brooks said.  
</P>
<P>
 In his first three crimes, the suspect was seen wearing a cowboy hat and 
Western-style shirt, and sporting a thin mustache and beard. But since Sept. 
10, when he robbed about $3,000 from a Great Western Bank branch in Glendale, 
the suspect has apparently dropped his cowboy disguise and now masks himself 
only with a pair of sunglasses, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of money the suspect has taken in each crime has varied from 
several hundred dollars to about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Since releasing a photograph of the man to the media and to local banks last 
week, Brooks said, Glendale police have received "numerous workable leads" from 
across Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This suspect is bold to continue committing crimes in the area even after his 
picture has been seen, but he's also been very successful so far," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But with a person showing up as often as he does, ultimately he's going to 
blunder, and that's when we'll catch him." STEVE RYFLE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; BOARD TO INTERVIEW TOP SCHOOL OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School board members will hold a closed-door meeting tonight with the Irvine 
Unified School District's three deputy superintendents to determine whether any 
of the high-ranking administrators plan to seek the job of Supt. David E. 
Brown, who is leaving the district in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, hired in 1987, recently resigned to become superintendent of the Napa 
Valley Unified School District. He said he had had enough of the hectic 
Southern California lifestyle. Brown is the second superintendent of the 
21-year-old school district. 
</P>
<P>
 A public discussion on the superintendent search will follow at the board's 
regular 7:30 p.m. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Reed, deputy superintendent of business services, declined to comment on 
whether he will be a candidate to replace Brown. Reed joined the school 
district in 1974 as a special education teacher, becoming an administrator in 
1986 under former Supt. A. Stanley Corey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board has indicated that they would like to speak to each of the three 
deputies," Reed said. "They are going to explore options inside the school 
district before they go outside. That's a compliment to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Waldfogel, deputy superintendent of curriculum and instruction, said he 
is "definitely not a candidate" for Brown's job. Susan Long, hired in 1987 as 
deputy superintendent of personnel services, also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board has not held formal discussions on Brown's replacement, but 
board President Mike Regele said he expects a nationwide search will be 
conducted, even if there are candidates from within the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we want to do is to see whether there's anybody on our staff 
who would want to be considered," Regele said. "I'm not saying anything more 
than that, other than this is the appropriate place to begin." RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA; COUNCIL TO WEIGH MOBILE DATA TERMINALS FOR 
POLICE CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will consider a plan tonight to spend $69,333 to install 
mobile data terminals in the city's 15 police patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Each terminal consists of a computer keyboard and small display screen mounted 
on a dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The system allows officers to communicate with each other car-to-car and with 
the Police Department's dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The terminals would allow officers to check for warrants and stolen car 
information before stopping a car, saving time and tipping the officer that a 
criminal may be at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 They also let dispatchers send officers to a call site without broadcasting 
the call on the radio, which can be intercepted by anyone monitoring the 
department's calls on a police scanner radio. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report by Police Chief Manuel Ortega, neighboring cities that 
have installed the MDTs report they are able to recover more stolen vehicles 
and arrest more wanted suspects by avoiding the verbal broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 The terminals would also allow officers to write their reports in the field, 
saving time in the report process by eliminating the need for transcription of 
handwritten reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The city considered installing MDTs with a link to Brea's system two years 
ago, but the plan would have cost $200,000, so it was scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the price has dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia would have to pay $1,000 up front plus $130 a month per terminal to 
the city of Brea for the link, plus buy the hardware at a cost of $34,983. 
</P>
<P>
 A $7,500 equipment maintenance contract is also part of the deal. HOLLY J.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; RED CROSS PLANS HOLIDAY GALA AT ALEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though the Alex Theater's first season as an entertainment hub has been a 
disappointment to many theater-goers, members of the Glendale-Crescenta Valley 
chapter of the American Red Cross hope to spruce up the venue's image by 
staging their first-ever "Christmas Spectacular" program and fund-raiser there. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the Dec. 9 event -- a two-hour variety show with KNBC weatherman 
Fritz Coleman as the master of ceremonies and award-winning composer and 
conductor Norman Henry Mamey as the producer -- went on sale Sunday at a 
kickoff party attended by about 300 supporters. Organizers said that the show 
will replace the Red Cross' annual New Year's Eve party at the Glendale 
Galleria, and that they hope it will develop a following over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This being our first year with this type of event, I wanted to start out 
small. But it will build up over time," said Mamey, who previously has produced 
fund-raiser shows for Ronald McDonald House that included such stars as Danny 
Thomas, pianist Roger Williams and actor Jamie Farr on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Mamey said the show will have a family-oriented Christmas theme, and "people 
will walk out of there ready to buy Christmas presents." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, who has appeared at several previous Red Cross fund-raisers in the 
Glendale area, will be the most recognizable celebrity at the show. Most of the 
acts will be Glendale-based, such as A Noise Within drama company, the Glendale 
College Vocal Jazz Ensemble and the Glendale Centre Theatre Players. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers will include several local personalities, such as Glendale 
Mayor Eileen Givens and other officials, who will appear in comedy sketches 
between acts. Organizers said there may also be surprise appearances by 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we would love to be able to do is to have Glendale become known for a 
major variety show that takes place every Christmas," Raggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mamey said organizers canceled the annual New Year's event at the mall after 
attendance dipped last year when the municipally owned Alex held its gala grand 
opening on the same night.  
</P>
<P>
 Plans were in the works for another New Year's show at the theater this year, 
and the Red Cross wanted to avoid having the two events compete again. However, 
the Alex gala has been canceled in light of a lawsuit between the city and the 
company that bowed out of a contract to manage the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,300 tickets are available for the variety show. STEVE RYFLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; VAPOR SYSTEM SAFETY WILL BE ADDRESSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A public meeting will be held Oct. 5 in Burbank to discuss a controversial 
plan for building a "vapor extraction system" that would emit potentially 
cancer-causing substances, but clean up contaminated soil at the former site of 
Lockheed's B-1 plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was announced Monday by the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District in response to complaints from nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for the installation of about 200 wells next year that will 
release up to 44 pounds a day of vapors from chemicals, such as carbon 
tetrachloride and chloroform, once used to degrease airplane parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Air-quality officials have determined that the project, to be built at 1705 
Victory Place, complies with regulations for air pollution control. They say 
there is less than one chance in 100,000 that anyone would develop cancer from 
breathing the carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Burbank Airport Hilton. VIVIEN LOU

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; BASKETBALL COURT CLOSURE DEBATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversy has erupted in Studio City between residents and sports 
enthusiasts over a decision by city officials to close a basketball court 
because of safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Studio City Recreation Center, 12621 Rye St., removed the hoops at the 
court Wednesday, one week after a gun was fired during a fight between two men, 
one of them a basketball player. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents say the shooting capped a series of escalating problems at 
the basketball court, including fistfights, profanity, littering and traffic. 
They support the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department's decision to take 
down the hoops because they say it may prevent another violent incident at the 
park, which draws many children. 
</P>
<P>
 But basketball players who use the court say the move was unfair to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an unfortunate situation," said Bob Tarr, assistant park director. 
"Whose rights are more important -- the safety of the children, or the rights 
of taxpayers to come to the park and expect that the basketball facilities 
could be used? I think the best solution would be if we could get (police) 
surveillance once we have the baskets back up." 
</P>
<P>
 But basketball player Nidal Ramadan said he believes some residents -- those 
who were effective in lobbying the park manager to remove the hoops -- were 
motivated by reasons other than safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramadan, a Lebanese-American IRS agent, said he is one of about 40 basketball 
players, mostly white professionals, who have been using the courts for years. 
After the 1992 Los Angeles riots, about a dozen men -- mostly young and black 
-- began playing at the courts, Ramadan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a predominantly white neighborhood," Ramadan said. "All the mothers with 
their kids are white, the tennis players are white. I've heard people say, 'We 
don't want them here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Area resident Margaret Orton angrily denied that race had anything to do with 
neighbors' concerns about the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is a single person on our street who pays any attention 
to (race)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one ballplayer, Jack Knight, who also is a nearby resident, said he 
thinks the hoops should stay down temporarily because "it sends the message 
that if you fool around, that's what we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Knight's telephone number is posted on the court's backboards, which he said 
people can call for information about the missing hoops. Knight said he has set 
up a meeting among players, residents, park officials and the Los Angeles 
Police Department on Wednesday night to discuss conditions for the hoops' 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures might include requiring players to sign a code of conduct or changing 
the tacit rule by which victorious teams are allowed to keep playing on the 
court, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect in the shooting was arrested and will be charged with assault with 
a deadly weapon, said Jim O'Riley, an LAPD senior lead officer. The suspect was 
released from police custody after making bail, O'Riley said. KAY HWANGBO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; MEASURE WOULD BAN LOITERING ON MEDIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Final approval of a law to prohibit loitering on medians of city streets is 
among the items scheduled for discussion when the City Council meets at 7 
tonight. The measure passed unanimously at its first reading Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Frank Benest has reported to the council that a "proliferation of 
vendors and panhandlers" occupying center medians is creating a safety hazard 
for pedestrians and passing motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Benest said the presence of anyone in a median could distract motorists and 
possibly lead to a fatal accident. He also said that peddlers in the medians 
are likely to illegally step into traffic and upset the traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposed law is enacted, violators would be subject to a $100 fine for 
the first offense within a year. A second violation within a year would be 
punishable by a $200 fine, and a $500 fine would be levied for the third and 
any subsequent violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also consider giving final approval to a measure that would 
formally require development projects valued at $500,000 or higher to follow 
the requirements of the city's Art in Public Places program. 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1975, the program is designed to beautify the city by having 
developers select, buy and install permanent, outdoor artworks that are 
accessible to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Glenn G. Parker said developers are being encouraged to work with 
artists early in the project design phase so that "a creative blending of 
architecture, landscape architecture and art might occur."ALAN EYERLY

 Social clubs and hobby groups will be treated the same as other nonprofit 
organizations when it comes to using the Yorba Linda Community Center under a 
policy the City Council will consider tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, only groups that have a narrowly defined tax-exempt status from the 
state qualify as nonprofit organizations. The city gives 12 free uses per 
calendar year of the community center to nonprofit groups and charges them 
lower fees for additional uses. 
</P>
<P>
 While many groups benefit from the policy, others complain that it excludes 
them because they lack tax-exempt status. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 Ocean Front Walk property owners will have a chance to tell the Planning 
Commission on Thursday night their opinions of proposed new rules limiting 
additions to their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed rules, homeowners would be permitted to build balconies, 
decks, patio covers and other extensions up to three feet from the front 
setback of a building as long as they use transparent materials.Opaque 
materials also would be allowed if the design of the extension is at least 40% 
open so it does not mar neighbors' views. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the extensions along both West Ocean Front and East Ocean Front 
are balconies, usually added with sliding glass doors for better home 
ventilation, according to a report by senior planner W. William Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Director James Hewicker said the new policy is the result of a 1992 
City Council request for uniform standards after the council approved two 
balcony permits. One had been granted by the city's modifications committee; 
the other had been denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's report indicates the modifications committee "is reluctant to approve 
any encroachment absent clear direction from the council on the matter." 
</P>
<P>
 The council directed that the policy target for possible demolition only 
additions on properties whose owners did not first receive a building or 
modification permit. Property owners would be able to apply for permits for 
extensions that were built without them.HOLLY J. WAGNER

<P>
 A public hearing on a reprimand stemming from sexual harassment charges was 
postponed Monday by officials of the Orange Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 A new date for the hearing of chief fiscal officer Joyce Capelle -- accused 
last December of tolerating sexual harassment in the workplace -- has not been 
set, according to Supt. Robert L. French. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education had dropped charges against Capelle in August, but she 
had requested a public hearing on a letter of reprimand that board members 
proposed to put in her file. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also postponed a closed discussion of a defamation suit filed by 
Capelle and two other administrators involved in the scandal. LESLEY WRIGHT

<P>
 With elections less than two months away, the National Issues Forum of Orange 
County will host a series of public meetings over the next two weeks focusing 
on ways to improve the political system. 
</P>
<P>
 Forum participants will examine the influence that wealthy "special-interest 
groups" have on politics and discuss how to streamline government bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other topics include promoting personal responsibility and encouraging people 
to participate in government. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine forums will be held in at sites around Orange County. They are sponsored 
by the National Issues Forum as well as local PTAs, libraries, colleges and 
civic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The first forum takes place tonight at Mission Viejo City Hall from 7 to 9. 
Other evening forums are scheduled Wednesday at the United Way in Laguna Hills, 
Thursday at the San Juan Capistrano California Federal Savings building, Sept. 
27 at Dana Hills High School and Sept. 29 at Laguna Beach City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon forums will be held Friday in San Clemente and Sept. 29 at Laguna 
Hills Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
 People interested in attending one of the forums should call the National 
Issues Forum at (714) 724-1412 to receive reading materials that will be 
discussed during the meetings.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; HEARING-IMPAIRED GET ROOM TO DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There will be no more dancing in the street for the Quiet Zone. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of practicing dance numbers and building sets in garages, living 
rooms and cul-de-sacs, the troupe for hearing-impaired performers has found 
proper rehearsal space in a Lake Forest warehouse-office building. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the Quiet Zone is not only free to expand its program and practice 
schedules, but members can now offer help to the county's hearing-impaired 
community through evening classes and workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an exciting time for us," said Joshua Vecchione, director of the 
Quiet Zone. "It opens the doors for us to involve more people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Quiet Zone tries to bridge the chasm between the deaf and hearing worlds, 
primarily through entertainment in a twice-a-year variety show, which benefits 
schools for the hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a unique window into the life of the hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Balloons are passed out at the door, so audience members who can't hear can 
better feel the throbbing beat of music. Interpreters are on hand for those 
without hearing disabilities, as performers sign lyrics during song and dance 
numbers. Comedy skits poke fun at stereotypes of the hearing-impaired, such as 
the way deafness is sometimes defined as a mental impairment by the hearing 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are deaf, you are in your own world," said Vecchione, who is 
hearing-impaired. "We are two different cultures, and the deaf and hearing 
cultures need to work together." 
</P>
<P>
 The Quiet Zone is one place where the two worlds meet. About half the 
approximately 60 performers in the most recent Quiet Zone production are not 
hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Signing classes held in the new Lake Forest facility are open to all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a reduced rate on this place for a year," Vecchione said. "I'm still 
amazed that we're here. We've got big plans for this place." 
</P>
<P>

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; GROUP GIVES BLIND READERS A HELPING HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It all began in Jean Norris' kitchen more than 35 years ago when Norris was 
looking for a way for blind parents to read to their sighted children and vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
 It has grown into the nonprofit American Action Fund for Blind Children and 
Adults, which is housed in a 7,000-square-foot building in Tarzana. The fund 
produces books, calendars and a newspaper for the blind. 
</P>
<P>
 As Norris tells it, in 1958 she met a blind mother whose sighted children 
couldn't understand why she couldn't read to them. In her kitchen, Norris took 
the children's books apart, added Braille text on separate pages and then 
re-bound the pages into books consisting of alternating Braille and printed 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, sighted and blind people could read the books together. Norris named 
the finished product Twin Vision Books.  
</P>
<P>
 From books, the mainly volunteer organization went on to produce a Braille 
newspaper and Braille calendars that are sent to subscribers throughout the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, Norris, with the help of volunteer transcribers, began to publish 
Hotline for the Deaf-Blind. The Braille newspaper is sent to the deaf-blind in 
the United States and 40 foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Braille calendars printed by Norris' group were intended as 
Christmas presents, but many other blind people began requesting the 6 
1/2-by-6-inch calendars. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1965, the only Braille calendars available were big and bulky and 
contained philosophy and religious things," Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, her group produces about 30,000 calendars a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the organization's library is computerized and there are four 
state-of-the-art Braille presses, the bulk of the transcribing for the books is 
still done by volunteers working at home with Braille machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris said that more than 100 volunteer transcribers receive printed books by 
mail, transcribe them into Braille and return the finished pages to be bound. 
The Braille translations remain as close to the originals as possible, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the books produced by Norris' group is a series with raised 
illustrations, such as "The Wonderful World of Trees," which allows blind 
children to picture the images. Another example features raised images of 
dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 copies of each illustrated book are produced, and copies are sent to 
every school for the blind in the United States as well as regional lending 
libraries. Schools often use the American Action Fund library as a resource for 
blind children, particularly for supplemental reading materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris said the organization conducts tours at its facility and is supported 
by donations of books as well as cash gifts. RAY PATTERSON

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: KAISER GRANTS GO TO AIDS SERVICE GROUPS

<P>
 Five area nonprofit HIV/AIDS service groups were awarded a total of $22,000 in 
grant funds from Kaiser Permanente. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants were awarded recently to organizations working to provide 
untraditional services to the city's AIDS population, estimated at about 
9,000.Such services include home delivery of food to AIDS patients too sick to 
leave their beds, emotional support, legal and benefits counseling, and 
transportation and housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 John Gile's group, Project Angel Food, Hollywood, delivers meals to the homes 
of 600 AIDS patients who are too weak to prepare food for themselves. About 120 
of their clients reside in the San Fernando Valley. The group received a $4,000 
community service fund grant through the program this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We greatly depend on these grants," said Gile, who noted that Project Angel 
Food obtains 95% of its funding from private and corporate sources. The other 
5% comes from federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Other area agencies awarded grants from Kaiser Permanente this year include: 
the Homestead Hospice and Shelter, which received nearly $7,700 to provide 
shelter for AIDS patients in areas including Van Nuys and West Hills; AIDS Care 
Inc., Ventura County, which received $2,667 to provide social services to those 
affected by AIDS; the Los Angeles Shanti Foundation, Hollywood, which benefited 
from a $5,200 grant to provide counseling and HIV/AIDS education, and Positive 
Friends for Life, a group that works in the Los Angeles area to counter the 
social isolation of heterosexuals infected with HIV/AIDS, received $2,500. TIM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN PRESENTS FILM ON DOMESTIC ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The specter of domestic violence is about to descend upon Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, it's for a good reason: to help victims of such abuse in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Academy Award-winning producer Stacey Kabat will visit CSUN today to screen 
and discuss her film "Defending Our Lives," which won the 1993 Oscar for best 
documentary short film. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, to be screened at 7 p.m. in the Northridge Center at the University 
Student Union, examines the cases of four women who killed their abusers and 
are now in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Kabat's appearance, which will include a lecture on domestic violence, is 
being sponsored by CSUN's Women's Center, which is asking the public to donate 
$3 to $5 to attend the screening. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's Center Director Susan Maroko, who says that her mother was slain in 
1962 by her stepfather, hopes Kabat's appearance can help prevent violence in 
the future by making Valley residents more aware of it and teaching them how to 
deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1962, nobody even talked about this problem," Maroko said in a statement. 
"My stepfather evaded charges after killing my mother. Because of what he did, 
I don't have a mother, my daughter doesn't have a grandmother and so forth. The 
pain of that kind of violence doesn't end in death. Kabat's message is about 
that vicious cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Kabat, the daughter and granddaughter of battered women, is also a human 
rights activist who won the 1992 Reebok Human Rights Award for her work 
documenting domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past six years, the U.S. surgeon general has listed domestic violence 
as the leading cause of injury to women, outweighing car accidents, rape and 
street robberies combined. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on Kabat's visit, contact the CSUN Women's Center at 
885-2780. JEFF SCHNAUFER

 Shannen Doherty parted with her jeans to raise money for the homeless of the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Lange handed over her jewelry.And Chevy Chase, his golf hat. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fund-raiser for the Valley Mayors' Fund for the Homeless on Sunday at the 
Sherman Oaks home of the agency's president, Patricia Winters, celebrity 
doodads and pieces of clothing were put up for silent auction. The amount 
raised is still being tabulated, but Winters said the event drew $5,000 in 
ticket sales alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mayors' Fund raises money for organizations in the Valley that help 
homeless people and battered women, such as the Valley Shelter and the Women's 
Care Cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulled from the original lineup of goods to be auctioned was O. J. Simpson's 
wardrobe from "Frogman," the pilot for a television series that Simpson had 
been shooting before he was arrested in connection with the slaying of his 
ex-wife and one of her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 While none of the "Frogman" clothing was auctioned at the event, Winters said 
she still intends to sell it. "If we can make money for our cause, we should do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Winters also held off on selling Mickey Rooney's Army discharge papers and 
opted to return them to him. Rooney exchanged the document for T-shirts and 
signed photographs, Winters said. MAKI BECKER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; BICYCLE ORDINANCE UP FOR APPROVAL

<P>
 An ordinance that will prohibit bicyclists from riding on sidewalks or in the 
street against the flow of traffic is expected to receive final approval by the 
City Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The council introduced the ordinance at its Sept. 6 meeting.Next week, the 
council is expected to decide whether violation of the new law is an infraction 
or a misdemeanor and will set the fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Larry Griswold said that under the proposed law, residential areas 
would be excluded. The law will apply only to major roadways in the city.  
</P>
<P>
 The rise in the number of bicyclists, combined with increased traffic, has 
resulted in more accidents since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold said in 1991 there were 14 injury accidents involving bicycles. In 
1992, that number rose to 36, and last year to 42.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the accidents that occurred from January, 1992, to October, 1993, 77% were 
the bicyclist's fault, Griswold said. Moreover, 65% of those occurred because 
the bicyclists rode against traffic on roadways or rode on sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can address that one violation, we can make a significant reduction in 
the number of injury accidents," Griswold said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department has made an effort to educate students about the hazards 
of bicycling on both sidewalks and streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold said if parents want assistance in mapping out a safe route for their 
children who ride bicycles to school, they can contact the Police Department 
traffic bureau at (714) 965-4481. DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; WEDDING BELLS NIX PLANNED BLUES FESTIVAL 
</P>

<P>
 Wedding bells have canceled the return of blues music to Heritage Park this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 A previously booked wedding bumped the Orange County Blues Festival from the 
park this weekend.Organizer Jim Oakes recently confirmed that the blues show 
will be rescheduled for sometime next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran out of time," said Oakes. "We were at the point of no return, and 
there was no time to get a new date." 
</P>
<P>
 Oakes tentatively set July 14 and 15, 1995, as the new dates for the festival. 
However, he is also considering holding the festival in August. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be go before the Planning Commission on Oct. 5 to seek approval of a 
use permit for Heritage Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakes had applied last spring for a permit to hold the festival, asking for 
the weekend of Sept. 24 and 25. Several weeks after the application was filed, 
city officials discovered that a wedding had already been booked at Heritage 
Park on Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 In late July, Oakes was told by city officials that the wedding had priority. 
He has since decided to delay the festival for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescheduling the show for later this year was complicated by a competing blues 
event, also known as the Orange County Blues Festival, which will take place 
Oct. 1 at Doheny State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakes and organizers of the Doheny State Beach show ran last year's blues 
festival in Heritage Park. The partners split acrimoniously, accusing each 
other of financial misappropriation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross-complaints have been filed in court for the rights to the name "Orange 
County Blues Festival." Both cases are pending.FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; CITY TO TRY AGAIN WITH FOURTH OF JULY EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a low turnout at the city's first Fourth of July celebration this 
year, the City Council has agreed to try again next year, this time with a 
fireworks show. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided last week that it is willing to spend up to $15,000 on a 
1995 Independence Day party at Laguna Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want us to do the event absolutely right," said Councilman Randal J. 
Bressette, who said $12,000 of the total sum won't be too much to spend for a 
high quality fireworks display. "If people come for the fireworks and they 
don't meet their expectations, there will be disgruntled people who won't come 
back the next year." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event included a small parade, a patriotic costume contest, a 
barbecue and carnival games. 
</P>
<P>
 It attracted about 300 people and cost the city $2,500 to put on, said Parks 
and Recreation Director Dave Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Melody Carruth said the city should start with a low-key 
fireworks display costing $10,000 or less the first time out, and then spend 
more money the following year if there is a good response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we can justify spending a lot of money," Carruth said. "I 
don't want us to overextend ourselves when we're not sure of what kind of 
participation we would have in 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the city's cost could be decreased if local service 
organizations come forward to help sponsor the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearest Fourth of July fireworks show is the Aliso Viejo Community Assn.'s 
display at Sheep Hills Park. Laguna Niguel, Lake Forest, Mission Viejo, Laguna 
Beach, San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente also have their own fireworks 
shows. LYNN FRANEY

PLAN FOR BRISTOL REDEVELOPMENT MOVES FORWARD; GOVERNMENT: SANTA ANA CITY 
COUNCIL GIVES PRELIMINARY APPROVAL TO ORDINANCE THAT OFFICIALS HOPE WILL 
RESOLVE LAWSUITS THAT HAVE LONG STALLED THE $355-MILLION PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The City Council gave preliminary approval Monday to an ordinance designed to 
jump start the $355-million Bristol Corridor Redevelopment Project, which would 
expand Bristol Street and revamp more than a dozen commercial areas along that 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved the ordinance at its regular meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related decision, the council agreed in closed session to attempt to 
settle the lawsuit that has stalled the redevelopment project, by offering the 
plaintiffs $149,000 in attorneys' fees and by loaning one of them money to 
upgrade his business. If the settlement is accepted, the project would be freed 
from litigation and could move ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which was approved in 1989, has been mired in the courts as a result 
of the lawsuit filed by two local residents, who argued that the city has not 
done enough to seek replacement housing for hundreds of families who would be 
displaced by the redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the businessman and single mother who filed suit in 1990 also 
said the city has not adequately explained why property near Bristol Street but 
not considered run down was included in the project area. 
</P>
<P>
 The city prevailed in Superior Court, but the 4th District Court of Appeal 
ordered city officials to resolve those issues before proceeding with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we've complied with the courts' ruling in the matter through the 
ordinance," City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said. "It indicates the reasons why 
non-blighted property was included in the project area. Secondly, it shows 
where alternative housing would be available." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the meeting, Attorney Richard Spix, who represents Robert T. Gonzales, 
an optometrist with offices in the project area, and Evangelina Avalos, a 
single mother in the zone, dismissed the ordinance as "a paper cover-up." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just more of the same. We don't get any meaningful action toward solving 
the real problem," Spix said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is still making findings that there's plenty of housing in Santa 
Ana. All the while 27,000 of the 91,000 dwelling units in the city are 
(considered) overcrowded by the U.S. Census," Spix said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert L. Richardson said the council's decision Monday night would 
move a long-stalled project forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It moves us one heck of a sight closer to getting the ugliest street in 
Orange County improved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the ordinance for final approval Oct. 3.  
</P>
<P>
 After that, Cooper said, the courts must decide whether the ordinance is 
legally adequate.

QUAKE-DEBRIS DISPOSAL PLAN DIES; PANORAMA CITY: A FIRM HAS GIVEN UP A PROPOSAL 
TO HAUL RUBBLE TO ITS UTAH LANDFILL BECAUSE OF WAITS FOR CITY PERMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A company that proposed hauling quake debris by rail from the vacant General 
Motors plant in Panorama City has given up on the project because of delays in 
obtaining city permits, a representative of the company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 ECDC Environmental, a Utah-based waste-disposal firm, had planned to begin 
hauling quake rubble to its 3,000-acre landfill in East Carbon City, Utah, by 
July, said Kent Loest, the firm's vice president for field operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Loest said the firm was told in June that the city would consider the 
permits under its normal approval process instead of under a quicker emergency 
process approved by the mayor shortly after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we would have the permits, most of the waste debris would be 
cleared away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lilian Kawasaki, general manager of the city's Environmental Affairs 
Department, said the death of the project will not have a severe impact on the 
city because local landfills have enough capacity to accept all of the quake 
debris. She added that the city is also vigorously recycling as much of the 
rubble as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawasaki said ECDC and other firms have not given up on the idea of rail haul 
in Los Angeles and are studying sites throughout the region as possible 
rail-haul centers. HUGO MARTIN

REPAIR, PREPAREDNESS EFFORTS SLOWED, SCHOOL DISTRICT SAYS; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS 
SAY LACK OF FUNDS AND RED TAPE ARE HINDERING MEASURES TO RECOVER FROM THE JAN. 
17 EARTHQUAKE AND ANTICIPATE FUTURE DISASTERS.

 Progress in making earthquake repairs and preparing the Los Angeles school 
district for another major emergency is being hampered by a lack of money and 
communications problems between agencies, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special Board of Education meeting, Los Angeles Unified School District 
officials said they want all staff members trained to better deal with 
emergencies, as well as more communications equipment and quicker approvals for 
money to pay for repairs on school campuses. But they said federal and state 
red tape is slowing the flow of funding to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about money," board member Leticia Quezada said. "We're not going to 
have a perfect system unless there are public dollars allocated to this." 
</P>
<P>
 While the meeting did not focus directly on school repairs, officials said 
about 4,400 campus buildings sustained some earthquake damage and that federal 
approvals to pay for the repairs have been slow. About $73 million has been 
allocated to pay for campus damage; the district's earthquake damage estimates 
range from $200 million to $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brown, the district's facilities director, said the process is 
ineffective, with too many inspectors approving some projects and not others, 
and that decisions have been inconsistent at best. Additionally, Brown said the 
schools must be responsible for securing equipment such as bookcases and 
hanging pictures in the event of another earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The securing of office equipment and classroom equipment has to be done at 
the site," Brown said. "We don't have the staff . . . to send people out to the 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Supt. Ruben Zacarias said the schools also will be required to pay for 
the equipment necessary to bolt the bookcases and to secure televisions, 
computers and VCRs, among other things. Campuses could spend several hundred 
dollars to anchor the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 While Zacarias said he believes most schools have the money necessary, he said 
the funds could come out of accounts used for books and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake caused widespread damage throughout the school system. 
All schools were closed for a week following the temblor. About a dozen schools 
opened after three weeks, and three campuses -- dubbed by Brown as the "Big 
Three" -- remained closed for six weeks. Those were John F. Kennedy and El 
Camino Real high schools and Van Gogh Street Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district is training six people in emergency preparedness from 
every campus -- including teachers, administrators and clerical workers. But 
officials said they need more money and more time to conduct the training 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, 2,500 school psychologists and mental health workers took a 
weeklong training session to deal with the psychological effects of a major 
emergency such as earthquakes. After the quake, 64,000 students and 15,000 
parents received counseling. The district has about 640,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also gave the board an update about earthquake supplies on school 
campuses. District critics had said the supplies were spotty and that first-aid 
kits had been ravaged at most campuses, leaving few basic emergency supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 New kits, however, will be distributed to schools next month. And the district 
is looking for money to provide cargo containers to hold more supplies for each 
of the 49 district high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding communications, officials said that they already have provided 
principals with pagers and that 70 administrators were given cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district has been unsuccessful in getting the federal government to 
pay for the updated communications equipment. Roger Rasmussen, who is 
overseeing the funding proposals from the federal government, said the White 
House and the U.S. Department of Education have turned down funding requests. 
"We're not giving up. We're going to look at every funding source because we 
know it's what our schools need."

SLAYING VICTIM FOUND IN ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was found shot to death Monday in a Canoga Park alley, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of the 6700 block of Mason Avenue was on his way to work at about 
5:20 a.m. when he backed his car out of his driveway, "and there was this body 
laying there," said Detective Rick Swanston of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's West Valley station. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man, identified as Edward Michael Garner, 21, of Canoga Park, had 
been shot several times in the head, Swanston said. Police suspect he may have 
been a robbery victim because his pockets were turned out and his wallet was 
missing when he was found. 
</P>
<P>
 The alley also was the subject of recent narcotics investigations, Swanston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police thought Garner was killed sometime between midnight and 3 a.m., when 
neighbors said they heard several gunshots. No one called police, however, 
until the body was discovered by the commuter, Swanston said.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; MTA LEADER WEIGHS RAIL LINE OPTIONS AS DECISION TIME NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mel Wilson, a Northridge realtor who has lived in the San Fernando Valley for 
more than three decades, has for the past year served on the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority's board of directors as an appointee of Mayor Richard 
Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 41, is vice chairman of the agency's planning and programming 
committee, which last week was briefed on a new cost comparison of rival plans 
for an east-west rail line across the Valley floor. The study found that a 
subway could be built for $19 million more than the cost of an elevated railway 
along the Ventura Freeway median -- a far narrower difference than once 
projected. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board is scheduled to decide on a route next month after years of 
debate and position reversals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spoke with Times staff writer Henry Chu about the proposed rail line, 
its history and its future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How long has the debate raged over the east-west Valley rail line? 
Why the holdup in getting it started?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The debate has been going on for almost 10 years. Principally it's two 
different groups of people: One group has been supportive of the Ventura 
Freeway alignment, and another has been supportive of what we call the Southern 
Pacific Burbank branch line, which goes down Chandler and Victory boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 That debate was really hot and heavy about six years ago. At that time, some 
local government officials agreed to support the Burbank branch line. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were other elected officials who represented parts of the Valley who 
were not completely sold on the Burbank branch. 
</P>
<P>
 That was mainly Mike Antonovich. Antonovich really felt strongly that the 
freeway would be the best way to go. His main issue was cost. The freeway 
alignment was almost half a billion dollars cheaper. The other part is that he 
wanted a high-tech, modern-looking system, and in his mind a monorail system 
fit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 So he put together a ballot initiative that asked for a vote from people in 
the Valley. There were about four different choices that they had. One choice 
was a monorail that would take you across the Valley, another a subway would 
take you to the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest group of people, 48%, said they supported the freeway monorail 
taking them all the way across the Valley. Antonovich felt that was a clear 
reading that folks supported the monorail. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your own position?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I've remained neutral. My goal since I got on the MTA board is to do my 
very best to bring the Valley together. There were already two very powerful 
people supporting either option, and I felt it wouldn't do me or the Valley any 
good to get in that battle. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Probably within the next three weeks or so I will take a stand on which 
alignment I support, but I haven't gotten to that point yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does one argue with the fact that more voters chose the monorail in 
1990 than the subway?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That's what Antonovich has been saying all along. 
</P>
<P>
 But the other side of the argument is that the vote was put in such a way that 
you had a choice of a monorail that took you across the Valley or a subway or 
another type of system that would only take you halfway. And most people would 
want to go all the away across if they had a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the primary advantage and disadvantage of the Ventura Freeway 
alignment?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The advantage of the Ventura Freeway alignment would be that it would be 
instant and cheap marketing to have a system that goes right down one of the 
busiest freeways in our region. You'd see people traveling along at a fairly 
even, smooth clip down the middle of the freeway while you're stuck in traffic 
in a car. That's a pretty strong argument to get people to change their 
behavior from that of a single-occupant vehicle to some kind of a public 
transit system. 
</P>
<P>
 The disadvantage would be that there are a lot of folks who would be 
negatively impacted with the freeway alignment, principally homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway alignment would require a widening of the freeway of about 35 
feet, 17 feet on each side. . . . It would basically eliminate the greenbelt -- 
the trees and the foliage that go alongside the freeway now. That would be 
replaced by some sort of sound wall. It wouldn't look that pretty, especially 
given how people are putting graffiti and tagging stuff all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the primary advantage and disadvantage of the subway alignment?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It seems to have the support of the majority of the folks who live along 
that corridor. There are some exceptions, but of the folks who live along 
there, the homeowner groups and the elected officials, most of them say they 
want that. That would be the best argument for it politically speaking, and 
this is going to be a very political issue. You need the support of those folks 
who are elected in those corridors to get an alignment to be financed. It's 
going to take a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it connects to a couple of junior colleges and the civic center in Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The disadvantage is that there are uncertainties when you do tunneling, as we 
found out in the work that's been done on the Metro Red Line. We're not sure 
completely what's under the ground. Although they do core samplings, it just 
doesn't always reveal everything that's down there. 
</P>
<P>
 So if you do a deep bore, you're certainly going to have some problems that 
would probably occur that we haven't foreseen. If you do an open trench, you're 
going to get a lot of the homeowners who are going to be mad that you are 
putting in an open trench on part of the system and a subway in other parts. 
There's going to be an issue of: "Are they better than we are?" and "Why should 
they get more protection than we?" 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The most recent cost analyses have narrowed the gap between the two 
alignments to about $19 million more for a subway, compared to a $440-million 
difference earlier. But in these recessionary times, isn't $19 million a 
significant amount?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's a lot of money, and I don't want to minimize that, but it's not a lot 
when you look at the overall scope of the work and the number of years the 
system is designed to be used for. You're talking a minimum of 50 years, maybe 
75 years. If you amortize that over that period of time, it's peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does it mean when officials speak of "federalizing" the project?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The majority of the rail projects that we've constructed, with the 
exception of the Blue Line, have been paid for as much as 50% by the federal 
government and 50% by state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 In order for a Valley project to work, we need to get a similar type of 
financing mechanism: 50% minimum from the feds and revenues from state and 
local government. And I believe we need to look at the private sector, too, to 
get some of the money to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 My sense is that the system will be financed in segments, similar to what we 
are doing with most of the other major rail projects. The first segment would 
go to the 405 Freeway. Then, if the voters feel that it's a system that's 
warranted and they're willing to pay for it, then perhaps we can figure out a 
way to finance from the 405 westward. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unrealistic to believe that we're going to be able to pay for the whole 
thing with one funding package. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some have suggested that another vote be taken over the alignment. Would 
you support that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. That would not serve us timewise. 
</P>
<P>
 We're looking at competing interests who want those dollars and who want to 
get bumped up in the long-range planning process. If we wait for a vote, what 
that really says is that we want to delay a decision for the Valley, and any 
delay for the Valley means that other competing projects will have additional 
time to build up their support base. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The timetable calls for the rail line to be built by the year 2018. Is that 
feasible?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think so, but we'll have to be creative. It won't happen if the MTA 
continues to do business as usual. We as a board will have to make some 
significant changes in the way that we do business. There are things that could 
be changed to get more efficiencies and cost savings in all the projects that 
we're building. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to make some major changes in the way we contract out, in the way we 
manage our real estate. We have substantial real estate holdings countywide, 
and I'm not sure we even know what we own. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm optimistic. I'm working hard to get the Valley line to be the next 
project after the Pasadena Blue Line extension.

CO-DEFENDANT OF HENLEY DENIED BAIL IN COCAINE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge denied a bail motion Monday for Willie Haghey McGowan, one of 
the co-defendants in the cocaine possession and conspiracy case involving Los 
Angeles Rams cornerback Darryl Henley and several others. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old McGowan, from Duarte, was a fugitive from justice until he was 
captured in April by federal authorities in San Diego. In an indictment 
unsealed last December, a federal grand jury charged that McGowan had worked 
with Henley to distribute cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 McGowan has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles 
since his arrest.

TODDLER CRITICALLY INJURED IN FALL FROM WINDOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-month-old boy was in critical condition Monday after falling from the 
second-story window of a home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred about 4:20 p.m. in the 3400 block of East Elm Street, 
when the toddler leaned against an open, screened window, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea Lt. Chester Panique said the toddler was playing on a bed near the window 
at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "The screen gave way and he fell to the ground," Panique said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the boy was flown by helicopter to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, suffering from shoulder and head injuries. The youngster was conscious 
and crying while being transported to the hospital, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Panique said the boy's mother had placed the toddler on the floor to play with 
other children prior to the accident. "Somehow he got up on the bed and leaned 
against the screen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who declined to identify the boy or his mother, said the incident was 
being treated as an accident and will not be investigated further.

CHAPMAN TOLD TO INSTALL CROSSWALK, TRAFFIC SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ensuring the safety of Chapman University students who dart across Walnut 
Avenue from the campus is the responsibility of the school, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the City Council ruled that the university will have to install a 
mid-block pedestrian crosswalk and signal on the busy avenue to protect 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's chief engineer, Bernie Dennis, also said the city should remove the 
four-way stop signs that were erected at Walnut Avenue and Grand Street when 
the university was building a new dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Chapman can afford to found a new law school, it can afford to mitigate 
the traffic there," Councilman Mike Spurgeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city put up all-way stop signs in 1988 after the college requested a 
pedestrian signal, Dennis said. But when Chapman built new dormitories three 
years ago, foot traffic started flowing across the middle of the street. While 
there are only enough vehicles to justify a one-way stop sign on Grand Street, 
pedestrian safety requires some kind of signal for the students, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Milt Galbraith, chief of campus safety at Chapman, said that the crossing 
should not be a problem. When it comes to student safety, "money would be no 
object," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby dormitory complex has 800 rooms, he said. Enrollment is at 600 to 
700 students now, but a full house would mean heavy pedestrian traffic crossing 
the street to get to the campus.

TRUSTEES FOR CYPRESS SCHOOL DISTRICT REVISE STUDENT TESTING PROCEDURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cypress School District Board of Trustees has unanimously voted to revise 
procedures for pupil testing. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes, effective this school year, include no longer giving proficiency 
tests to second-grade students and eliminating the California Test of Basic 
Skills (CTBS) for first-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the second-grade proficiency test is not 
state-required and that "the present test is not a true indicator of 
proficiency." 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the district, the staff also said, "First-grade test scores are 
not needed and do not usually reflect a child's progress in the academic 
subjects." 
</P>
<P>
 Other test changes approved by the school board include purchasing and using 
updated CTBS tests for students in the second through sixth grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's CTBS tests traditionally have been administered in the spring, 
but starting in the 1995-96 school year, the tests will be given in the fall.

CASA YOUTH SHELTER, SPORTS PROGRAM GET COUNTY GRANTS

 Casa Youth Shelter last week received a $2,500 county grant to help support 
the shelter's art therapy counseling program for troubled teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder presented the check to Myldred Jones, who 
founded Casa Youth Shelter in 1978. It provides a residence for youths 12 to 17 
who have run away from home or are having problems with their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter has served more than 7,000 youths and reunited 85% of them with 
their families. Wieder presented the check during the shelter's annual 
fund-raiser at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Save Our Youth, a nonprofit group that provides sports, fitness and 
recreational programs for teen-agers in Costa Mesa, also received $5,000 from 
the county's social program grant.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEIGHBORS OPPOSE PLAN FOR FAMILY REC CENTER; 
CANYON COUNTRY: THE FACILITY, UP FOR REVIEW, WOULD OFFER MINIATURE GOLF, WATER 
SLIDES AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. RESIDENTS FEAR GANGS AND TRAFFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What builders foresee as a long-awaited family entertainment center in rural 
Canyon Country, some nearby property owners fear will be a magnet for traffic, 
noise and gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans for the privately owned Santa Clarita Family Recreation Center -- 
proposed for 5.8 acres along Oak Spring Canyon Road southeast of the Antelope 
Valley Freeway -- will be up for review at 7 p.m. tonight by the Santa Clarita 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed by Royal Clark Development of Beverly Hills, the center will 
include two 18-hole miniature golf courses, nine batting cages, four water 
slides, bumper boats, a Go-Kart track and an activities center with video games 
and food service. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer has argued that the center would provide an alternative to the 
Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park for local youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that's certainly needed," said Bob Martinez, an engineer for 
Sikand Engineering, who prepared the project's planning documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary plans for the center have been under way for about a year, 
Martinez said. The developer is aiming for a May, 1995, opening. 
</P>
<P>
 But several area residents who paid upward of $300,000 for their homes say the 
recreation center would bring unwelcome noise and artificial light to their 
neighborhood. They also fear that an influx of teen-agers will bring graffiti 
and litter to their area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe it will devalue the property," said Stanley Gibbs, who lives 
along nearby Lost Canyon Road. "I put my home up for sale when I heard about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs, 49, said he and his neighbors aren't looking to deprive teens of having 
fun, but they want to maintain the rural nature of their neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 "We bought here and built here for a reason," Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents living near the property expressed similar concerns in letters 
to the city Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project would cause and attract all sorts of problems with noise, 
traffic, loitering teen-agers, crime, etc.," wrote Lost Canyon Road residents 
Mary and Arthur Ludwig. "Why would anyone even think of a project such as this 
is absurd!" 
</P>
<P>
 "A park like this may be family oriented by day, but at night there will be 
trouble with teens and ultimately gang activity," wrote Shari and Frank Gibb. 
</P>
<P>
 Those behind the recreation center say it will provide not only safe 
activities for families but also sales tax revenue for the city. And Martinez 
said the noise and crime concerns of local residents would be addressed, 
possibly by designating a buffer area on the property to create more distance 
between the center and homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 He also rejected concerns that youths will intrude into surrounding 
neighborhoods. "I think kids are going to be dropped off by family members and 
picked up at prescribed times," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials did not seem concerned. With most of the proposed center's 
teen-age patrons expected to come from the Santa Clarita area, according to 
Capt. Mike Quinn of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station, the facility 
isn't expected to generate additional crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any greater threat than a bowling alley or a roller-skating rink 
would provide. Or even a fast-food place," Quinn said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: FORTUNE PETROLEUM SAYS RUMORS CAUSED STOCK JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief executive of Fortune Petroleum Corp. said unusually heavy trading 
and a $1 jump in the price of its shares last week may have been caused by 
unfounded rumors of a "significant discovery" at a Texas oil well, as well as 
descriptions of the Agoura Hills company as a possible takeover candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Fortune's stock price had jumped to $3.125, up almost 50% from its 
price a few days earlier.Last Tuesday, 96,000 Fortune shares changed hands, 
nearly 10 times the normal daily volume, said Tyrone J. Fairbanks, the 
company's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairbanks said during the unusual trading activity last week, the company was 
asked by a number of investors about a rumored significant discovery on its 
LaRosa property in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company has not made a major discovery on the LaRosa or any other of its 
properties," Fairbanks said. "We are concerned that investors may be trading in 
our stock based on rumor." 
</P>
<P>
 Fairbanks also said the heavy sales activity may have stemmed in part from an 
article that appeared in an oil trade publication describing Fortune as a 
possible takeover candidate. Fairbanks said the company routinely acquires 
other companies, but has no intention of being the subject of an acquisition 
itself. "We're always making acquisitions," Fairbanks said. "It is our 
determination to, in any type of acquisition, to be the surviving party."

FULL SPEED AHEAD; AFTER SLOW YEARS, LOCAL CAR DEALERSHIPS' SALES ARE ZOOMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of recession-induced doldrums, many local car dealers are now 
enjoying brisk sales, mirroring the trend nationwide and throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're killing them," said Rick Hanchett, general sales manager at Canoga Jeep 
Eagle in Canoga Park. "We've had record months ever since January. We can't 
keep the cars on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Jeep Eagle is cashing in on the explosive growth in demand for sport 
utility vehicles such as Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep Cherokee and the Ford Explorer. 
Hanchett said sales of the luxury Grand Cherokee models have been particularly 
strong. At one point, he had just one remaining Grand Cherokee on the lot, 
compared to the 40 to 60 he usually has in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 From the first of the year through mid-September, Canoga Jeep Eagle's unit 
sales jumped 21% over the year earlier, to 783 from 649. And gross sales zoomed 
36%, to $1.2 million from $880,000 in the 1993 period. Profit per car has also 
risen, Hanchett said, largely because of customers' preference for luxury 
models and added features. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the San Fernando Valley and surrounding areas, many other car dealers 
are reporting that sales are finally picking up after remaining stagnant or 
declining since the beginning of the decade. The growth can't come too soon for 
the local auto industry, which continued to suffer through 1993 as California's 
economy lagged behind the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, sales of domestic and Japanese vehicles were robust in the first 
half of the year, and the trend is expected to continue into 1995. Auto 
analysts say that sales in the United States are on a pace to hit a booming 
15.5 million units this year, up from 14 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysts say that Southern California car sales still aren't increasing as 
fast as those elsewhere in the country. But sales are gaining speed here, said 
Christopher Cedergren, senior vice president of the Santa Ana-based auto 
research firm AutoPacific Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of pent-up demand for cars," Cedergren said. "The age of the 
fleet in California and the country is at a record high. There's a lot of old 
cars on the road that need to be replaced." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for California dealers, he added, is that their car sales will 
probably continue to grow through 1997, when the rest of the country is 
expected to head into another cyclical economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, some of the local dealers seeing big increases have benefited from 
the closure of other dealerships throughout the area during the past several 
years. Many are also getting a boost from the upsurge in auto leasing, which is 
being fostered by heavy incentives offered by the manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both factors have helped sales balloon at Galpin Ford in North Hills, one of 
the two largest Ford dealers in the nation, said owner H. F. (Bert) Boeckmann 
II. In the first eight months of this year, Galpin Ford sold 7,354 new cars and 
trucks, up 35% from 5,440 vehicles sold in the comparable 1993 period. That 
helped fuel an overall sales gain of 35% for all new and used cars, to $192.5 
million from January through August versus $142.7 million a year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeckmann said that his Galpin Lincoln-Mercury and Saturn dealerships have had 
similar increases. And while profits per car are down because of price cutting, 
total profits are rising because the volume of sales is so great. "When you get 
your volume up, that's where you really make your money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the recession, when other dealerships were cutting back, Galpin kept 
expanding, a factor Boeckmann now cites as a key reason for his strong sales 
growth. And when other dealers closed -- such as Mission Hills Ford, which went 
out of business in 1991 -- Galpin pulled in new customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeckmann also said that sales really took off this year after the earthquake, 
when the pent-up demand for new cars was unleashed. July and August were record 
sales months at Galpin Ford, he said, and September "could be our biggest month 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
 That's due in part to customers like Tom Ordorff of Tujunga, who has decided 
to buy one of the fast-selling Ford Escorts for his wife, their first new car 
in many years. "We put off buying for a long time," Ordorff said, but his 
wife's old car is now "trashed" and he wants her to have a new car for 
shuttling around their young daughter and 1-month-old son. Ordorff said he was 
also motivated by what he sees as good deals available on new cars recently. 
</P>
<P>
 With sales picking up, some local car dealers are finding themselves running 
short on inventory. That's because manufacturers steered car allotments to the 
Midwest and East, where sales began rebounding sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest problem is keeping cars in stock," said Peter Tuohy, sales manager 
at Keyes European in Van Nuys, which sells Mercedes-Benzes and Volvos. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Tuohy said sales are up 15% to 20% over last year. He attributed 
the increase, which started about three months ago, to a rush to buy cars at 
the end of the 1994 model year and lower prices for the top-of-the-line S-class 
Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many dealers say that manufacturers' incentives have helped their sales, but 
other factors have had an impact as well. At Star Auto Group in Glendale -- 
which includes Ford, Chrysler-Plymouth-Jeep, Lincoln-Mercury, Saab, Acura and 
Isuzu dealers -- Vice President Steve Bussjaeger said car sales are up 16% over 
a year ago and truck sales have skyrocketed 44%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bussjaeger attributed the increases mostly to the auto group's move more than 
a year ago to a facility three times the size of its former site, while at the 
same time adopting a lower-pricing strategy. As at Galpin, the profit margin on 
each car sold has been squeezed, but "we're doing so much more volume that it 
makes it well worth it," Bussjaeger said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to booming sales of sport utility vehicles made by Ford and 
Chrysler, he said, the van business is hot, including the Ford Aerostar and 
Windstar and Chrysler minivans. Some dealers also have high hopes for the newly 
redesigned Chevrolet Blazer. 
</P>
<P>
 There are exceptions to the local surge in sales. Some dealers of 
Japanese-made vehicles are having a harder time lately because the strong yen 
has forced up the prices of their cars, although some Japanese cars sold here 
aren't affected because they are made here. What's more, although Japanese car 
manufacturers have been seeing overall sales increases in the United States, 
they are up against the toughest price and quality competition in years from 
resurgent Detroit automakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Through much of the 1980s, Hondas were among the best-selling cars, but Rick 
Gart, sales manager at Honda of Valencia, said his sales are stagnant now, as 
they have been for the past few years. "Right now it's a rough situation, 
because you're in between the old models and the new models," Gart said. 
Ideally, he'd like to have all the 1994 model cars sold by the end of the year, 
but he is worried that rising interest rates could hurt that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Gorman, executive vice president of the California Motor Car Dealers 
Assn., a Playa del Rey-based industry group, cautioned that, although the 
picture has improved for many area dealers, auto sales here will probably still 
lag the rest of the country for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to see relatively stable sales" through next year, he 
said. But in Southern California "we've had a devastated aerospace and defense 
industry. I think that's going to continue to have an impact. The people we've 
talked to don't see a real red-hot market."

REGIONAL EARNINGS: IWERKS REPORTS LARGE LOSSES FOR QUARTER, YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iwerks Entertainment Inc. in Burbank, as expected, reported large losses for 
its fiscal fourth quarter and year ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwerks was one of last year's hottest public stock offerings as high hopes 
were pinned on the company's specialized movie theaters, simulation rides and 
virtual-reality attractions.But Iwerks, founded by two former Walt Disney Co. 
executives, has had trouble finding locations for its urban entertainment 
centers and other products. Last month, it announced that it expected to post a 
loss for fiscal 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 In the June quarter, Iwerks lost $5.23 million, compared to a year-earlier 
loss of $1.03 million. Its fourth-quarter revenue fell 13%, from $12.7 million 
to $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year, the company lost $8.06 million on a 14% increase in 
revenue, to $36.6 million. In fiscal 1993, Iwerks earned $1.25 million on $32.2 
million in revenue.

 Pay-Fone Systems Inc., a Van Nuys-based provider of automated 
payroll-processing services, reported a profit in its fiscal fourth quarter 
after a loss in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months ended June 30, Pay-Fone earned $21,526 while its operating 
revenue rose 8%, to $1.09 million.A year before, the company lost $49,720 on 
operating revenue of $1.01 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year, Pay-Fone reported net income of $188,966, a 25% increase 
from its $151,015 profit in fiscal 1993. Its annual operating revenue was $4.46 
million, off slightly from $4.51 million in the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed part of its revenue and earnings growth to its February 
acquisition of Concentric Computer Corp. and added that it is seeking other 
acquisitions or alliances.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: COUNTRYWIDE DROPS PLANS TO CONSTRUCT 
BUILDING IN SIMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Countrywide Funding Corp., the giant mortgage banker that has suffered along 
with the rest of its industry lately, has abandoned plans to construct a new 
building alongside its loan servicing and data-processing center in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news, reports spokeswoman Laura Lippman, is that the 1,100 people 
working in the Ventura County facility appear to be safe from the layoffs that 
have hit the rest of the mortgage company. "Our loan-servicing business is 
growing," she says. "We're at that building's capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, about 1,400 Countrywide workers nationwide have been let go, 
including many at the corporate headquarters in Pasadena. But now Countrywide 
has more workers in Simi Valley than in Pasadena, according to Lippman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the layoffs have been in loan-origination, not in servicing," she 
said. Many of the employees in Simi work on processing payments on mortgages 
that have been sold in the secondary market. Countrywide services $100 billion 
in such loans, earning fees for the work, Lippman reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the company purchased the former Gibraltar Savings structure in 
1992, a Countrywide official said architectural studies were being made for the 
possible construction of another large building on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, any work overflow in Simi will now be handled at a Countrywide 
facility in Plano, Tex. Lippman said she didn't know why the Simi expansion 
plans were dropped, although "the friendly business climate in Texas could be a 
factor."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: INFOMERCIAL PRODUCER SELLS 400,000 SHARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Positive Response Television Inc., a Sherman Oaks producer of infomercials, 
said it has sold 400,000 new shares of its common stock for $12.50 each to a 
group led by the investment firm Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the sale of the stock, which represents 11.2% of the company's 
total shares outstanding, will raise Positive Response's cash position by about 
$5 million, it said. The money will be used mostly to increase air time for 
three current infomercials and new infomercials to be shown in the coming 
weeks.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: T-HQ ABANDONS PLANS TO SELL NEW STOCK TO PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 T-HQ Inc., a Calabasas publisher of video game software, said it has abandoned 
plans to sell additional stock to the public because of a series of financing 
deals and a private stock sale. 
</P>
<P>
 T-HQ said it completed a $3-million credit facility for its domestic 
operations.It also said it has signed a letter of intent to complete a 
$1.75-million credit facility for its foreign operations, and has sold 2.5 
million shares of its common stock in a private transaction, resulting in 
proceeds to the company of $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company said it plans to raise another $3.75 million in 
equity financing through private transactions within the next 60 to 90 days. 
T-HQ said that a large share of the financing proceeds would be used to market 
and manufacture a new video game modem for use with the Sega Genesis system.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: COMMUTING BY PHONE AND PLANE TO DETROIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Cedergren, executive vice president of AutoPacific Group Inc., an 
auto-industry market analysis firm, may rank as Ventura County's No. 1 
telecommuter. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a notable long-distance commuter too. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his office is in Detroit, Cedergren spends 40% of his time at his 
home in Thousand Oaks. Using a word-processor, a modem and a telephone, he 
keeps in touch with auto executives throughout the country and files reports to 
AutoPacific's headquarters in Santa Ana. "Besides the electronic commuting, I 
log 75,000 to 100,000 miles a year on planes, traveling to Detroit and other 
cities. It's worth all the effort to be able to spend a lot of my time in 
Thousand Oaks. I've lived here since I was 9 and I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 With a new car model year about to start, Cedergren cites two major trends in 
the auto market. "First, there's the emergence of the baby boomers as dominant 
buyers. People between 30 and 48 now account for almost half the cars and 
pickup trucks sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want the best of both worlds, so they've chosen the rugged look and the 
comfort offered by sport-utility vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 This, he says, explains the popularity of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Ford 
Explorer and Chevrolet Blazer. 
</P>
<P>
 Another emerging trend: Cedergren says that auto makers will make a big push 
to hold and even reduce prices, trying to overcome the rising cost of meeting 
safety and anti-smog regulations.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: LEASING EFFORTS PAY OFF FOR 1000 TOWN 
CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hallways are no longer empty in Oxnard's 1000 Town Center, the green glass 
office building that ran into financial trouble soon after its completion in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The 110,000-square-foot structure was only 41% occupied when it was sold last 
December by Citicorp, which had taken possession from the project's developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owner, Bedford Property Investors Inc., a Lafayette, Calif.-based real 
estate investment trust, has just capped an aggressive leasing campaign by 
announcing that 1000 Town Center is now 98% occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "The improved economy may or may not have been a factor," says Roger Galassi, 
Bedford's vice president of asset management. "Mainly, I'd credit a strong 
leasing effort. We responded promptly to all inquiries, and we were ready to 
make any modifications required by prospective tenants." 
</P>
<P>
 Three new tenants -- a dental group, a group of accountants, and a public 
relations firm -- have just taken a total of 11,000 square feet of the 
six-story building overlooking the Ventura Freeway. Last May, Bedford leased 
50,000 square feet to Kinko's Service Corp., parent of the worldwide Kinko's 
chain of copying centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Galassi insists that the real estate investment trust made no unusual 
concessions to corral the tenants. "Basically, the leases were priced at the 
market."  
</P>
<P>
 Bedford paid $5.1 million for 1000 Town Center, whose original development 
cost was estimated at about $19 million. "As you can imagine, we're highly 
pleased with the investment," Galassi noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedford, which specializes in commercial and industrial properties throughout 
the West, has recently been offered several other buildings in Ventura County, 
Galassi disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interested in Southern California, including Ventura County, but we 
probably won't buy the other buildings we've heard about in the county," 
Galassi said.

WORKING IN A VACUUM; TECHNOLOGY: COMPUTERS, REVERSIBLE MOTORS ALLOW FIRMS LIKE 
O.C.'S AIRLINK INTERNATIONAL TO GIVE NEW TWISTS TO PNEUMATIC TUBE SYSTEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Electronic mail traffic might be backed up bumper-to-bumper along the 
information highway, but a handful of companies are finding plenty of room to 
maneuver in a decidedly old-fashioned conduit -- pneumatic tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pneumatic tubes are an old technology that's new again," said Eric Berge, 
president of Airlink International in Orange, which manufactures tube systems 
for commercial and industrial applications. "There are lots of things that you 
can't send through e-mail." 
</P>
<P>
 Drafty and noisy pneumatic systems of yesteryear carried little more than 
paper and small bundles of cash. But driven by precise motors and guided by 
computerized controls, newer systems are increasingly likely to carry many 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
 The devices use canisters to carry objects through tube systems that are 
hidden behind walls or in the ceilings of buildings. Motors create an air 
vacuum that carries canisters through the network of tubes at speeds of up to 
30 feet per second. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico uses a tube system to carry 
irradiated materials to a testing laboratory. United Air Lines plans to use a 
7,100-foot tube system to shuttle aircraft parts to passenger gates when 
Denver's huge new airport opens, which is expected next spring. A Southern 
California church group uses an Airlink tube system to carry bingo game 
proceeds to an office for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Pneumatic tubes date back more than 100 years, to a time when businesses both 
in Paris and New York moved paperwork between nearby buildings, using manually 
operated bellows to create the needed vacuum. Manufacturers of the systems 
subsequently used electric motors to create the vacuum needed to move the 
lightweight canisters, but most systems remained relatively simple. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, the industry harnessed the power of computers and reversible 
motors. Computers allow manufacturers to install sophisticated systems with 
dozens of stations. Old systems had to have two tubes, but new systems use 
reversible motors that make it possible to send and retrieve canisters through 
the same tube. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry -- about half a dozen manufacturers, including Orange-based 
Airlink -- now generates slightly less than $100 million in total annual 
revenue, up from about $45 million a decade ago, said Charlie Kegley, a vice 
president at Denver-based TransLogic Corp., which manufactures systems used 
mainly by large hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Airlink said it expects to generate about $12 million in 1994 revenue, up from 
about $1 million a decade ago. Berge created the company in the mid-1970s to 
make low-end systems, but since has expanded into more complex, 
computer-controlled systems, which have greater profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple systems are increasingly popular in warehouse-style stores and 
other retail operations where managers have to move large amounts of cash from 
registers to back offices. "We initially estimated (the retail niche) as a 
$5-million or $6-million market," Berge said. "But we were way under." 
</P>
<P>
 Absent the computerized bells and whistles, the basic physics are unchanged. 
Said Kegley: "We're still using the same principles of controlling air to move 
objects." 
</P>
<P>
 Basic pneumatic systems cost about $2,000. But prices vary for more complex 
systems that use computers to route canisters to dozens of different locations 
and that can track shipments as they make their way through the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Tube manufacturers created new markets in the 1980s when they opted to "start 
to move away from moving paper to moving things," Kegley said. "We started to 
give people the confidence level needed to use tubes to carry something other 
than paper and money." 
</P>
<P>
 United's system, which was designed by TransLogic, moves jet aircraft parts at 
up to 25 feet per second, which is fast enough to produce dramatic operating 
cost reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the pneumatic tubes, we'd have to use trucks to physically drive over 
to where the parts are," United spokesman Joe Hopkins said. "But that simply 
won't work at the new Denver airport, which is twice the size of Manhattan 
Island." 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers actually throttle systems down for hospital use because blood 
products can separate when canisters fly around corners at high rates of speed. 
"It's called hemolysis," Berge said. "And it's a great concern to hospital 
administrators." 
</P>
<P>
 Speed also is a potential danger when it comes time to stop. "Stations have 
been destroyed by careless employees," Berge said. "You have to remember that 
even a five-pound bag of cash is going to do some damage when it's moving at 30 
feet per second." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no big secret, Berge said, to making canisters stop. "We bleed off the 
air about six feet before the station," Berge said. "When the canister hits the 
column of dead air, it slows to almost a dead stop immediately. It's just like 
a parachute." 
</P>
<P>
 Computers and reversible motors allowed the industry to develop reliable 
systems that use automatic sensors to track deliveries, an important element in 
hospitals, for example, where shipments carry drugs or laboratory tests. But 
Kegley said the "largest bump in the market" came during the 1980s when 
hospitals started adding new tube systems to cut rising operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Memorial Medical Center is using a state-of-the-art system designed 
by Airlink International to move specimens to a central laboratory in the 
basement and drugs from its pharmacy. The system, with nearly 80 stations, 
speeds deliveries throughout the seven-story building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had tube stations 15 years ago, but they were so unreliable that we just 
abandoned them," said Pathology Department Director Terry White. "The old tubes 
are still there in the walls."  
</P>
<P>
 After the new system was installed, the hospital eliminated costly satellite 
laboratories and pharmacies scattered about the hospital and consolidated the 
functions in central locations. 
</P>
<P>
 TransLogic, which concentrates on complex systems for the hospital market, 
expects continued growth, Kegley said, because less than a third of the 
nation's 3,000 larger hospitals have modern pneumatic tube systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Berge, 50, thinks the pneumatic tube industry might benefit from a name 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phone companies insist on putting us in the Yellow Pages under pneumatic 
tubes, which nobody knows how to spell, much less know what pneumatic means," 
Berge said. "It's a real frustration, believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 Berge is lobbying phone directories to create a "message systems" listing for 
companies like Airlink. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ironically, one of our biggest selling points has been the warehouse clubs," 
Berge said. "We get four or five calls each month from someone who saw the 
tubes at a checkout counter but didn't know where to get one." New Spin on an 
Old Idea 
</P>
<P>
 Pneumatic tubing systems use air to route delivery carriers from point to 
point within a building. Developed over a century ago, the original systems 
were pumped with a large bellows. New systems, like those manufactured by 
Orange-based Airlink International, use reversible motors, computers and 
electronic sensors. Carrier: Carrier moves 25-30 feet per second. Send-receive 
station: Light panel indicates whether network is free for sending. Red light 
means sender must wait until incoming carrier arrives before sending. Computer: 
Tracks carriers, monitors air pressure. Electronic sensors: Tell computer where 
carrier is within system. Diverters: Route carrier to proper destination and 
can hold carriers to allow priority deliveries. Air bleed-off valve: Located 
near send/receive station. Reduces air pressure to slow carrier down before 
landing. Blower: Motor blows air or creates suction for two-way travel. How It 
Works 
</P>
<P>
 1) Sender fills carrier with item to be sent -- such as cash, paperwork or 
aircraft parts -- and places inside station door. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Sender selects station destination. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Carrier makes a soft landing at receiving station.

ROPAK STOCK JUMPS AFTER INTEREST BY CRUTTENDEN; MARKET: BIG INVESTMENT BANKER 
BUYS ABOUT 10,000 SHARES AS FULLERTON COMPANY PREPARES FOR EXPANSION.

 Stock prices of Ropak Corp., a Fullerton maker of plastic container products, 
jumped almost 13% a share Monday, after strong initial interest from Cruttenden 
& Co., an Irvine-based investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Ropak shares were up 93 cents to close at $8.31 a share on Nasdaq trading 
volume of 154,700 shares, compared with an average daily volume of 
11,700.During Monday trading, the stock reached a high of $8.50 a share, 
matching its 52-week high, achieved Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Cameron, chief financial officer for Ropak Corp., said that Pete 
Castellanos, an analyst with Cruttenden, Orange County's largest investment 
banking firm, visited the company Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was pleased with what he heard, so there has been activity in the buying 
side," Cameron said.  
</P>
<P>
 But William Porter, director of trading for Cruttenden, said that, while he 
originally had put in an order to buy 20,000 shares of Ropak on Monday morning, 
the company ended up purchasing only about 10,000 shares.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we were much of a force in the stock," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron said that Ropak has focused on the industrial market and plans to move 
into the consumer market with various products, including an eight-gallon 
container designed to hold dog food, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For its second quarter ending June 30, Ropak reported revenue of $35.9 
million, compared to $32 million for the same period in 1993. Net income for 
the quarter jumped to $2.3 million, or 46 cents a share, from $1.8 million, or 
40 cents per share, last year. 
</P>
<P>
 With 650 employees nationwide, Ropak has 10 plants in the United States and 
Canada.

 Supermarket signs aren't the only things changing now that Ralphs Grocery Co., 
headquartered in Compton, is being merged with La Habra-based Food 4 Less. 
</P>
<P>
 During a Friday news conference at the Food 4 Less headquarters building, a 
handful of employees acknowledged that they're uncertain where they'll be 
working after the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 But a number of jobs will be transferred to Ralph's massive Compton 
headquarters and warehouse facility. Food 4 Less President and Chief Operating 
Officer George Golleher, who's been named vice chairman of the merged 
companies, will be making the drive to Compton as the chains are consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Golleher now faces a 90-mile round trip from his Laguna Beach home to the La 
Habra office. The commute to Compton will be four miles shorter, but Golleher 
said he expects the traffic to be noticeably heavier.

 Honored Twice: John Martin, chairman and chief executive officer of the Taco 
Bell Corp., is being honored for his innovative ways by two diverse 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be honored by the Multi-unit Foodservice Operators group today during 
its annual meeting in New Orleans.Martin will speak at the meeting on "how 
leaders kindle entrepreneurial spirit, and how innovation often comes from the 
middle of organizations, not always from the top down," said Taco Bell 
spokeswoman Janice Page. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Martin won the first Innovation In Hospitality Management Award 
presented by the Professional Development Institute of the School of Hotel and 
Restaurant Management at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a real indication of John Martin's creativity that he's being 
honored by both academia and the industry," said institute spokesman Tarun 
Kapoor. "We honored John for his innovations and as a person who's brought the 
concept of value to the hospitality industry."

 Disney Store Growth: The Walt Disney Gallery will open Nov. 4 in MainPlace 
Santa Ana. The new store will "celebrate the history, creativity and 
inspiration of the Walt Disney Co.," according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery will sell Disney animation art, collectibles, fashions and home 
accessories. Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Michael D. Eisner described 
the new retail venture as an extension of its existing Disney Store chain, 
which already has a location at MainPlace. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we opened the first Disney Store in 1987, no one would have predicted 
that today, seven years later, we would have 310 stores operating in eight 
nations," Eisner said. "Given the growing popularity of Disney animation art, I 
believe the Walt Disney Gallery will prove to be our next strong winner in the 
retail environment."

 Cardiovascular Dynamics Inc.: The company, which is developing specialized 
catheters for angioplasty procedures, said that a major Minnesota medical 
company has bought a 19% stake in the company as part of a business alliance to 
spur the use of the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 SciMed Life Systems Inc., based in a Minneapolis suburb, paid $5 million to $6 
million to acquire its stake in Cardiovascular Dynamics and to obtain a license 
for certain of the company's balloon angioplasty catheters that also deliver 
drugs to affected areas of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The drugs are aimed at preventing early recurrences of heart conditions that 
require angioplasty treatment. SciMed is one of the leading angioplasty 
companies, but Irvine-based Cardiovascular Dynamics has two patents for 
catheters that handle both balloon angioplasty and drug delivery systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceeds from the sale of the stock will be used to develop Cardiovascular 
Dynamics's technology further, said Chairman Michael Henson. The catheters are 
used in a number of foreign countries, including Japan, and are in clinical 
testing in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining majority interest in Cardiovascular Dynamics continues to be 
owned by Endosonics Corp. in Pleasanton.

 Cerplex Group Inc.: Shares of the Anaheim company gained a bit Monday from 
Friday's 21% drop caused by the company's report that revenue was slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock fell after it said that its repair contract with 
International Business Machines Corp. would result in lower-than-expected 
third-quarter net income of about $1 million, or 7 cents to 8 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerplex, which provides repairs on IBM machines, said late Thursday that it 
expects its revenue shortfall from IBM will continue into the fourth quarter, 
which ends Dec. 31, but that it should be offset by increasing revenue from new 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Cerplex stock fell $3 a share to close at $11.25 a share in heavy 
trading, making it the third-largest percentage loser on the Nasdaq system. On 
Monday, the stock rose 25 cents a share to close at $11.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerplex provides electronic repair services and distributes electronic 
components. The company said IBM revenue fell about $7 million in the current 
quarter, although its overall revenue climbed to $32 million, up 68% from the 
year-ago period.

STOCK JUMPS 19% AFTER ARMY DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Safety Components International Inc.'s stock jumped by nearly 19% after the 
company announced it has been awarded a contract by the U.S. Army for the 
production of 120mm mortar cartridges. Safety Components' stock closed Monday 
at $17.25, up $2.75 from Friday's closing price of $14.50. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year contract to produce the casing used in making the large caliber 
ammo is valued at $65 million and contains an option for the Army to purchase 
up to $200 million worth of mortar cartridges. A spokesman for the company, 
which is primarily a producer of air bags for the automotive industry, said the 
exact terms of the option are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 President Robert A. Zummo said he expects the contract to add significantly to 
the company's revenue and increase the share of the company's business that is 
defense-related beyond the current 17%. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 
Safety Components recorded losses of $384,000 on revenue of $22.44 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Components International in Costa Mesa sold $15 million worth of air 
bags to TRW Safety Systems, a division of TRW Inc., last fiscal year and a 
spokesman said the company is on track to sell about $40 million in air bags to 
TRW this fiscal year.

<P>
 At the plaintiffs' request, a federal district court in Santa Ana has 
dismissed a shareholders' lawsuit against Rainbow Technologies Inc. and some of 
its officers and directors, the company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits were filed in December, after Rainbow reported lower-than-expected 
third-quarter results.The suits sought unspecified damages and alleged that the

MORE NEWS IS GOOD NEWS FOR 'DATELINE NBC' SHOW; TELEVISION: THE NEWSMAGAZINE, 
ONCE REELING FROM STAGED CRASH DISCLOSURE, EXPANDS TO THREE TIMES A WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Neal Shapiro left a producing job on "PrimeTime Live" to become executive 
producer of "Dateline NBC," some of his colleagues at ABC News reacted as if he 
were trading a coach seat on the Concorde for a first-class ticket on the 
Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
 "People at ABC News said I was crazy, that nobody could make a success of 
themselves at NBC News," Shapiro recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 When Shapiro came to "Dateline NBC" in March, 1993, the network was still 
reeling from the disclosure a month earlier that "Dateline" producers had 
staged a fiery crash for a report about General Motors pickup trucks. Three 
"Dateline" producers and the president of NBC News resigned in the wake of the 
highly publicized incident, and morale at NBC News was very low. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, 18 months later, "Dateline NBC" becomes the first major network TV 
newsmagazine to air three nights a week in prime time -- with broadcasts 
Tuesdays at 10 p.m., Wednesdays at 9 p.m. and Fridays at 9 p.m. (although this 
week it will be at 8 p.m.). With Jane Pauley and Stone Phillips as the 
principal anchors, "Dateline NBC" will use Tom Brokaw, Bryant Gumbel, Katie 
Couric, Maria Shriver and other NBC News talent to report stories and, 
occasionally, to help with anchoring duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-nights-a-week format, Shapiro said, "will allow us to jump on the 
news and to report both features and investigative stories across the week. 
It's an exciting opportunity to try new things with the newsmagazine format." 
</P>
<P>
 The turnaround in the fortunes of "Dateline NBC" is considered the most 
visible sign of a resurgence at NBC News in recent months. Pauley gives credit 
to Shapiro and Andrew Lack, the former CBS News producer who was named 
president of the news division after Michael Gartner stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neal inherited a group that was shell-shocked, although we were continuing to 
put a show on every week," she said. "We got more resources under Andy Lack, 
and, over time, we began doing a very credible broadcast." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the ratings for "Dateline NBC" never took a serious dip, despite all 
the negative publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that viewers understood that the GM story was an isolated incident," 
Shapiro said. "People lost their jobs over it. As we produced a better program, 
I think they've given us a chance and liked what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when "Dateline" expanded this past summer from one night a week to 
two, the second installment on Thursday nights beat "PrimeTime Live" in nine of 
11 head-to-head matchups. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "NBC News today is considered a player in network news in a way that it was 
not a year ago," said one ABC News producer. " 'Dateline' has resources and 
staff, and having three hours a week is going to increase the level of 
competition among newsmagazines." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, 37, an award-winning producer for hard-news and investigative pieces 
on "PrimeTime Live," said that "Dateline" will use its franchise for a variety 
of stories, from breaking news to multi-part investigations. The first such 
investigation -- on the safety of the U.S. water supply -- will air over 
several nights this week, and others are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other network newsmagazines, "Dateline" will give heavy coverage to the 
O.J. Simpson story. Couric will do an interview this week with Simpson's adult 
children, Arnelle and Jason, and Phillips will be "sub-anchoring" the program 
from Los Angeles, offering brief updates or longer pieces on the issues raised 
by the trial.  
</P>
<P>
 The format also may accommodate segments of varying length, such as a recent 
"Dateline" that devoted nearly a full hour one night to re-creating in 
documentary-style fashion the ill-fated mission of U.S. soldiers who died in 
Somalia. Shapiro also has added lighter features to "Dateline," from a 
department on popular culture called "State of the Art" to viewer feedback via 
FAX and E-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Producers at other networks say that having three installments a week will 
give "Dateline" some advantage in booking celebrity guests and newsmakers. This 
summer, when "Dateline" was airing twice a week, Pauley landed an interview 
with Michael Fay, the young man who was caned in Singapore, and Fay's attorney 
was quoted as saying that one factor in his decision to talk to "Dateline" was 
that the interview would be aired in two parts.  
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro acknowledged the potential advantage, but he said that "the news value 
of the story," not the demands of the newsmaker, will determine the play an 
interview gets. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by "Dateline's" performance over the summer, Lack -- who had raised 
the idea of "stripping" a newsmagazine across prime time when he became 
president of NBC News last year -- made the decision to repackage the "Now" 
newsmagazine as a third night of "Dateline." The move "offers the advantage of 
having all of the anchors working together on one program, rather than 
competing against each other for stories on competing newsmagazines," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly feel under pressure to succeed," Lack said, "but NBC has given 
us a strong commitment of hours and, while I don't think we'd be on the air if 
we have two lousy seasons, I think everyone understands that newsmagazines 
traditionally take time to grow."  
</P>
<P>
 But even if "Dateline" is not an immediate success in the new format, said 
Bill Croasdale, president of network buying for Western Media International, 
"it already is doing well for the network because it is cheaper to produce than 
entertainment programming, and the three hours are programming that NBC owns 
itself."

LAUGHS ON BOTH SIDES OF MASON-DIXON LINE; JEFF FOXWORTHY TURNS JOKES ABOUT 
SOUTHERN BACKGROUND INTO HIS FUNNY BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedian Jeff Foxworthy was born and raised middle class in Atlanta. Before 
entering show business a decade ago, the Georgia Tech grad, with a 
thick-as-molasses Southern drawl and a down-home manner, did computer repair at 
IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when Foxworthy starts talkin' north of the Mason-Dixon line, some Yanks 
just assume he must have been brought up in some rural trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the 36-year-old funnyman has received more good-natured hick remarks 
than a truckload of Ozark hillbillies. And he has managed to take those remarks 
and turn them into a franchise -- five books, a hit comedy album and reams of 
material for his stand-up act, which comes to Los Angeles Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started back in the late '80s when, Foxworthy recalls, "some people 
were kidding me about being a redneck when I was working at a club in Michigan. 
That comedy club was attached to a bowling alley that had valet parking. I 
said, 'Look out the window, this is (an area rife with) rednecks! You have 
rednecks!' It occurred to me that there are people in this country who don't 
really know what a redneck is. So I went back to my hotel and I wrote five ways 
to tell if you're a redneck." 
</P>
<P>
 That guide was incorporated into Foxworthy's stand-up routine and immediately 
was a hit. Today, the popular comic has more than 200 one-liners on the subject 
at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Foxworthy, "You might be a redneck if . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 * You go to the family reunion to meet women. 
</P>
<P>
 *"Say no to crack" reminds you to pull your jeans up. 
</P>
<P>
 * You wear a dress that's strapless with a bra that isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 * You've ever cut your grass and found a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Foxworthy broadly describes a redneck as a person "with a glorious lack of 
sophistication." The mustachioed comedian insists that these characters can be 
found in just about every culture or ethnic group.  
</P>
<P>
 "I opened up for (jazz trumpeter) Wynton (Marsalis) one night," Foxworthy 
says. "That was probably an 80% black audience. I got a standing ovation." 
</P>
<P>
 Foxworthy first used the material in books -- five of his six paperbacks are 
redneck-themed. Last year came his debut comedy album, "You Might Be a Redneck 
If . . .," which has given his career a major boost. It has been on the 
Billboard Country album charts for 34 weeks and is currently ranked No. 12. A 
recently released single called "Redneck Stomp," combining his comedy material 
with a country-dance music track, has helped increase sales of the year-old 
album to more than 400,000.  
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that Foxworthy grew up a rock 'n' roll fan and didn't start 
listening to country music until a few years ago. Nevertheless, he has learned 
some valuable lessons from the country artists with whom he has performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Foxworthy says Southern and heartland singers like Garth Brooks are the most 
fan-oriented entertainers he has ever seen. And today it's common to find 
Foxworthy, who was selected the American Comedy Awards' best stand-up comic of 
1990, in the theater lobby after a performance chatting and signing autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Foxworthy believes that it's imperative that comedians stay in touch with 
everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody asked, 'Why is it that when comedians get older they aren't funny 
anymore?' " he says. "Some of it is that they're just not funny. But a lot of 
it is when they start becoming successful they quit going to the grocery store, 
they quit going to the bank, they quit doing those things that people can 
relate to. You have to be able to relate to people." 
</P>
<P>
 The first six or seven years of Foxworthy's comedic career were spent largely 
on the road. He says he used to do about 500 club shows a year, often times 
performing two or three a night. 
</P>
<P>
 The tide began to turn for Foxworthy in 1990 after he migrated to Los Angeles 
in the hopes of landing the major TV appearances that had eluded him in 
Atlanta. The move paid huge and immediate dividends. Within three months he was 
a guest on "The Tonight Show" and had inked a deal to star in his own Showtime 
special. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Foxworthy routinely headlines in theaters and small arenas around the 
country. He also has the luxury of performing mostly on the weekends; the rest 
of his time is spent at his Beverly Hills home with his wife, Pamela, and two 
daughters, ages 2 1/2 and 5 months. 
</P>
<P>
 But success hasn't made Foxworthy complacent. He's currently writing a script 
for a feature-length comedy movie, and a humorous book of drawings of people he 
has observed on the road is scheduled for release next year. If that's not 
enough, he claims there isn't a comedian alive who does more radio interviews 
than he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every morning of my life I'm doing eight or nine stations," he states. 
"I have a little office in the back of the house and I go there at 4 or 4:30 in 
the morning to do drive time on the East Coast. I sit there from 4:30 to 4:45 
and I talk to Baltimore, and from 4:45 to 5 I talk to Cleveland. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Foxworthy has established a strong following among country music 
fans, he dislikes being labeled a "country comedian." In fact, his redneck 
routine is a relatively small part of his two-hour stage show. Most of his 
jokes and anecdotes involve more universal issues like fatherhood and marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this self-proclaimed part-time redneck isn't about to disassociate 
himself from the hayseed culture that has made him so popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody said that with rednecks you're talking about the lowest common 
denominator," says Foxworthy. "Well, I say it's the most common denominator. 
The majority of us are guilty of some (redneck behavior). There are very few of 
us who are part of rich, highbrow society. When you live in L.A., you think 
everybody's hip and well-dressed. Get in your car. I've been to . . . every 
state. What's between New York and L.A. is what's real life." 
</P>
<P>
 * Jeff Foxworthy perform s at the Wiltern Theatre, 3790 Wilshire Blvd., 
Saturday at 8 p.m. $21.50. (213) 380-5005 .

A BALLET TROUPE'S HISTORY RECAPTURED; DANCE: JOSEPH RICKARD'S FIRST NEGRO 
CLASSIC COMPANY GOT ITS START IN 1947. NOW HIS ARCHIVES ARE AT THE HUNTINGTON 
LIBRARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ISENBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The time was 1946. Dancer Joseph Rickard saw an African American child turned 
away from classes at a Los Angeles dance studio just because she was black. 
That didn't seem right to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard, who was white, decided to do something about it. Opening a studio 
himself in the black community, he trained that child -- and her mother -- and 
sought other black students who wanted to learn classic dance. And then, aiming 
to provide a place for them to perform, as well as a chance to choreograph, he 
launched the First Negro Classic Ballet in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many people remember the First Negro Classic Ballet, which predates the 
Dance Theatre of Harlem and is believed to be the nation's first black 
classical ballet group. But thanks to the persistence of former Rickard student 
Kathy Ho and her serendipitous meeting with a Huntington Library curator, 
Rickard's personal archives have landed at the San Marino research institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard's papers, photographs and other memorabilia came to the attention of 
the Huntington last year when Ho presented a paper on the First Negro Classic 
Ballet at a Cal State student research competition. Not only did Ho win first 
place, but her topic intrigued one of the judges -- Mary Robertson, the 
Huntington's chief curator of manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later -- and just weeks before Rickard died of pneumonia in late August 
at 75 -- Rickard's personal archive made its way to the Huntington. The 
collection's 270 items include many black-and-white stills of dancers 
rehearsing or performing, as well as musical scores, large color drawings of 
set designs, programs, newspaper clippings and correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 The clippings include several reviews of the company, says Sue Hodson, 
Huntington curator of literary manuscripts. "They're wonderful because they 
tell us how the public viewed them -- good and bad. They also provide 
historical material on race relations."  
</P>
<P>
 Rickard dedicated most of his life to teaching and choreographing dance for 
that company and others locally. He studied with Russian dancer/choreographer 
Bronislava Nijinska, says family friend Sunny Asch, and trained his own dancers 
in classical, Russian-style ballet. The company played to good crowds here and 
on tour before being disbanded in 1959.  
</P>
<P>
 But memories fade. Former student Ho, recalling all the photographs and tales 
Rickard shared with her over the years, was surprised to find no mention at all 
of the First Negro Classic Ballet at a major exhibition in 1991 on Southern 
California dance history. The omission got her started researching the company 
through oral history and documents. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Huntington showed interest, and Rickard responded favorably, Ho and 
Rickard began assembling his holdings into order. Together they collected and 
organized the material, pulling it together from closets, cupboards, file 
cabinets and even under beds at his Highland Park home.  
</P>
<P>
 Ho continues to chronicle the company. Later this year, she'll present her 
ongoing research, which she plans to publish, at the Congress on Research in 
Dance (CORD) national conference. And she's hoping some former dancers with the 
company will surface and add to the library's materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Curator Hodson, meanwhile, has begun processing and cataloguing the collection 
and expects to be done in 1995, at which time it will be made available to 
scholars. The Rickard archives essentially launch the library's dance 
collections, and Hodson says she hopes one day to do a public exhibit at the 
library on dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The collection documents a group whose story otherwise might not have been 
told," says curator Hodson. "Too often, organizations outside the mainstream 
tend to be forgotten."

BOOKS & AUTHORS/ ORANGE COUNTY: REVEALING LITTLE SAIGON -- FROM THE OUTSIDE IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strolling through the Asian Garden Mall, the indoor Vietnamese shopping center 
in the heart of Little Saigon, novelist Nina Vida discusses the fine art of 
bartering Vietnamese style. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a ceremony," she says, recalling the time she went shopping for 
jewelry with a Vietnamese female friend. "I was completely out of the thing 
because it was all in Vietnamese at this point. They went on and on and finally 
the girl brought out some strawberries from behind the counter and we all had 
some strawberries and I said to my friend, 'Are we through?' And she said, 'No, 
we're just resting.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Vida's friend -- a former Vietnamese refugee who was among the first wave to 
arrive in the United States after the fall of Saigon in 1975 and is now a 
successful businesswoman -- provided much of the inspiration for the shrewd 
protagonist in Vida's new novel, "Goodbye, Saigon" (Crown Publishers; $20). 
</P>
<P>
 Meet the brash and beautiful Anh, a fast-talking self-promoter who supports 
her mother, brother, sister and her sister's four kids as a "shoeshiner" at a 
poker casino. As Vida writes: "They didn't shine shoes. They shined egos, 
reassured losers, fawned over winners" waiting "for a few stray chips, a tip, a 
commission, a fee for services to come their way." 
</P>
<P>
 When the fat-cat American lawyer she has been bringing good luck to at the pai 
gow poker table stops showing up after three months, Anh goes looking for him. 
It turns out the cocaine-snorting lawyer is near death after overdosing and his 
secretary, Jana, a law school dropout, has been handling his cases in his 
absence. A single mother, Jana needs money as desperately as Anh does. 
</P>
<P>
 Together they set up a bogus law practice in Little Saigon. The name of the 
game is to settle cases out of court. Business booms. But when Anh rebuffs a 
vicious Vietnamese gang leader's demand for a cut of the action, the two women 
and their families find themselves in jeopardy.  
</P>
<P>
 Family honor, revenge and Anh's tragic past in war-ravaged Vietnam all play a 
role in Vida's vivid portrait of Little Saigon.  
</P>
<P>
 The novel, which was optioned by Richard Zanuck while still in manuscript form 
last year, is just now hitting bookstores. But it's already receiving advance 
praise. Kirkus Reviews calls it "powerhouse fiction" and a review in Glamour 
magazine describes "Goodbye, Saigon" as a "thrillingly polished tale." 
</P>
<P>
 So convincing are Vida's immigrant voices and her portrayal of the Vietnamese 
experience that when Ann Patty, Vida's editor at Crown Publishers, first read 
the manuscript she assumed it was written by a Vietnamese immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt so true to me it was hard for me to believe she wasn't Vietnamese," 
Patty said by phone from New York. "It seemed like I was reading the kind of 
recent immigrant experience that I hadn't read before and it didn't feel 
filtered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of what I found remarkable about the novel is that if you look at Amy 
Tan or some of the Spanish people who are writing books that are becoming 
popular it's an experience filtered through a couple of generations having been 
in this country, and I think it's due to the language barrier. You don't get 
the raw new (immigrant) experience because the people don't know the language 
well enough to write it." 
</P>
<P>
 Explained Vida over lunch in a Vietnamese restaurant: "I just put myself in 
the voice and head of the immigrant." 
</P>
<P>
 There is, of course, more to it than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vida's home in Huntington Beach is only a 15-minute drive to Little 
Saigon, she not only had never visited the Vietnamese business district in 
Westminster but she wasn't even curious. "I just figured it's like any other 
ethnic community: It's different in it's own strange way, but what does it have 
to do with me?" 
</P>
<P>
 But that changed in 1990 after Vida's husband Marvin -- a former Century City 
lawyer who had taken a long sabbatical in the '80s -- decided to go back to 
work part-time and wound up in a law office in Little Saigon, the heart of 
Orange County's more than 71,000-resident Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
 The clients, as well as the entire office staff, were Vietnamese, and when the 
original American lawyer dropped out of the picture, Marvin Vida started his 
own practice, quickly becoming a trusted friend to his Vietnamese staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, the Vietnamese women in his office wanted to get to know his wife. 
They began inviting her to lunch. Dinner and parties followed and the Vidas 
reciprocated. 
</P>
<P>
 As Vida got to know her new friends, they began telling her stories about 
their struggles to make a new life in America and they talked freely about the 
horrors and hardships of their past lives in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Vida says she wasn't thinking of writing a book, but she started jotting down 
the dramatic and unusual stories she was hearing, dropping them into a file 
marked "Little Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
 After 2 1/2 years, she says, "I had quite a big file." 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point came when she and her husband attended a Vietnamese wedding 
that ended in a riot after rival gang members started a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bottles started to fly," she recalls. "Everybody was climbing over the 
bandstand to get away and there was blood everywhere. I said to my husband, 
'Let's get out! I want to go.' But my husband wouldn't go because it was his 
friends' (wedding) and he just didn't want to leave them. By the time it got to 
the point where they were going to start shooting each other, the police were 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 That was it, she says. When she returned home from the wedding, she went up to 
her office and wrote five pages of notes on the incident; she knew she had 
enough background material and insight into the community to write a book. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she had reservations about writing what she had learned, thinking, 
"these are my friends, I can't really use these stories."  
</P>
<P>
 "So I asked my closest (Vietnamese) friend, 'What do you think about my 
writing a novel about what I know about Little Saigon?' She said, 'I think it's 
a wonderful idea. Nobody knows us like you do.' And I said, 'OK, you know it's 
not going to be all rosy, rosy and good stuff. It's going to be everything I've 
seen.' And she said, 'Oh, I know. What do you think, I don't know? Of course, I 
know. That's OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Once she decided to write the novel, Vida says, she passed up no chance to 
observe Vietnamese life and culture. She asked her friends to take her to a 
Vietnamese fortuneteller and to the gambling club in the City of Commerce where 
Vietnamese play the Asian card game called pai gow.  
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband also regularly went to a popular nightclub in Little 
Saigon, a place where patrons must pass through a metal detector and security 
guards search women's purses. But once inside, Vida says, "time is erased. You 
are no longer in the United States in 1994, you are in Saigon in 1960. The 
women are in sequins and high heels and the men are in finely tailored suits 
and ties as though it's New Year's Eve." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband also would fill her in on his work in Little Saigon, telling her 
about having to bail gang members out of jail or clients arrested trying to 
smuggle cash to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vida borrowed her Vietnamese friend's speech pattern -- the 
rapid-fire cadence and the use of American slang when least expected -- she 
emphasizes that the story of Anh is not her friend's story. It's based on a 
compilation of all the stories she's heard and all the Vietnamese people she's 
met over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Vida describes Anh as "shrewd and conniving. She's annoying and she talks too 
much, but I think she's a good person. She's full of integrity, loyalty and 
nobility. And she's a survivor. I think she's to be admired." 
</P>
<P>
 Jana, she says, is also "a survivor of a tragedy of her own. There's no 
pretense and there's no glamour, and she is who she is. She's also pretty 
astute, pretty clever and she thinks her way out of things. They both think 
their way out of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Vida, who had her husband review all the legal references in the novel for 
accuracy, says it's not uncommon in Little Saigon for Vietnamese without law 
degrees to open up law offices. They operate by settling cases before having to 
go to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want money right away; they don't want to go to court," Vida says. 
"They're willing to have a few thousand in their hand rather than the $100,000 
the case is worth if they had a real lawyer. Also, these offices are taking a 
very small percentage of the settlement or the recovery because they don't do 
anything. They can afford to take a small fee, whereas a guy who's writing 
briefs and taking depositions and going to court can't compete. It's a big 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 It's too early to see how the Vietnamese community will react to Vida's novel. 
But one of the first Vietnamese to read "Goodbye, Saigon" is Kieu Chinh, an 
actress who appeared in "The Joy Luck Club" and is a backer of Viet World 
magazine in Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Vida, she said she read the book nonstop and that it evoked 
"sad, angry, touching feelings." The dark side, she added, "is a complicated 
part and the hardest one to describe in an immigrant community's life in the 
United States. Under your sharp observation, however, the scenario and all the 
characters in the story appeared as lively as real people, real life in 
details, well set between the present in the United States and intercut with 
flashbacks in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 Vida is sure, however, that some Vietnamese may not be pleased with her not 
always flattering depiction of Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 "But how do you deny what's there?" she says, adding that "I also talk about 
corrupt policemen in there, I talk about judges who are idiots in there, and 
insurance attorneys who are idiots. I mean, we've got idiots everywhere. It's 
not only (the Vietnamese). But they're very sensitive and like to put a good 
face on things. I don't blame them; we all do. We don't want people to look 
inside (our lives). Especially when you're newcomers, you don't want people to 
think badly of you. And I don't think people are going to because I think 
there's enough good portrayed" in the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 What surprised her most in coming to know her Vietnamese friends, she says, 
"is their capacity for loyalty, which is unsurpassed. I just have never seen 
anything like it. The other is their generosity. If you need a dollar and they 
only have one dollar, they'll give you the dollar. If they've got a house and 
you don't have a place to live, they could have 10 families living in there and 
they'll say, 'Move in.' "

FIXATIONS / ORANGE COUNTY: THE CAVEMAN OF LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One never knows quite what to expect when going to meet someone who lives in a 
cave in a rock. 
</P>
<P>
 I did have some apprehensions about meeting John Parlette, though. All I knew 
about him, other than that he lived in a rock, was that he is a Laguna Canyon 
artist, and that seemed a fearsome combination. I expected to be greeted by 
some egocentric beret-head who most likely had developed a tedious manifesto 
linking his cave, the arts and man's essential isolation, and who probably only 
lived in a hole to keep his "eccentric" credentials intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Much as I hate to let facts cloud my perceptions, that's not quite Parlette, 
and even if it were, with him standing 6-foot-4 and weighing a muscular 265 
pounds, I wouldn't be the one to tell him. 
</P>
<P>
 The 54-year-old former lifeguard and lifetime surfer's philosophy of art is 
simply that he makes what he likes, which happens to be tiki gods carved in 
pumice stone and sculptures of animals and cresting waves. Similarly, he's 
lived in a rock for 26 years because he likes it there. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the only part of his home that might be called a cave is the rock 
overhang under which his Spartan foam mattress bed resides. That overhang forms 
one wall of his comically small but functional home, the other three walls 
being made of scavenged wood and glass. The whole thing -- perhaps 50 square 
feet -- sits on a shelf near the top of a large, cliff-like sandstone rock that 
rests just off Laguna Canyon's narrow, winding Castle Rock Road.  
</P>
<P>
 His floor is sloping bare rock, into which he has carved a couple of small 
channels to direct the rainwater. For running water, he has a hose that runs to 
a spigot above a beaten zinc bucket. He also has run electricity in, powering a 
small fridge, lights, a hot plate and TV. You don't want to know about his 
toilet provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the wall space is given over to windows, with a sweeping view of the 
canyon. Much of the remaining surface area is covered with photos of friends 
and postcards of unclad Polynesian women. One of the corner uprights was 
formerly a volleyball net post at Laguna's Main Beach. Some of the roof beams 
have Japanese writing on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's dunnage from Japanese freighters, what they used to pack their cargo 
in," Parlette explained. "In the late '60s while studying industrial arts at 
San Diego State, after school I'd walk the beaches down there and would find 
this stuff washed up. Then the plywood used in here was from the form lumber 
used in making South Coast Hospital that they let me have." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the beers he gave to some friends to help build the fireplace, his 
sole expense in constructing the house was $50 for roofing shingles. Though the 
house has withstood the elements and earthquakes for a quarter-century, it's 
not necessarily a building inspector's dream, not that one has ever seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first built here, it was county territory and they didn't give anybody 
any crap. That was kind of in the hippie years, and people were doing their own 
thing. Plus, there was a big dog living up here, and he didn't let people get 
out of their cars too much. So you'd see these officials' white cars drive up, 
and then just drive away," Parlette said. 
</P>
<P>
 His eagle's nest of a home is reached by coming over the top of the rock or 
climbing a rock path from below. Assayed without a degree of caution, either 
route could afford visitors a 30-foot plunge to the base of the rock.  
</P>
<P>
 It's down there that Parlette first began living in a cave, in a wide, shallow 
cutout at the rock's base. When Parlette and his lifeguard buddies began having 
lobster boils there in the late '50s, the cave roof was already deeply 
smoked-stained by its previous Native American inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Parlette rented a cabin near the rock, but during the summers another 
lifeguard and his wife wanted the cabin, "so I'd move out and just throw my 
sleeping bag in the cave. I'd wake up in the mornings and there'd a be a little 
trail of ants going across my hand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually found the digs too claustrophobic, noticed the comfortable 
depression in the rock shelf above, and moved up a few floors, building his 
present home there in 1968. The property was owned by a lifeguard friend's 
mother, who said he could stay there as long as he liked. Parlette eventually 
bought the property.  
</P>
<P>
 He's built a decidedly more typical house on the lot next to the rock but has 
never lived in it. Instead he leases it out to cover the mortgage on the 
property, permitting him to lead what he jokingly refers to as his "bon vivant 
lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parlette was born in Albany, N.Y. His family moved to South Laguna Beach when 
he was a child, and he immediately took to the rustic beach life.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was a little village market down there and not much else. We didn't 
have much guidance, so consequently my brother and I would just take off into 
the hills and got to know where the snakes, Indian caves and rabbits were. The 
San Joaquin Hills were so beautiful, a complete little ecosystem with foxes, 
barn owls and badgers.  
</P>
<P>
 "And then there were the Hawaiians here. One was Pua Kealoha, a famous 
beachboy, a diver, a surfer, a 300-pound pure-blooded Hawaiian who swam with 
Duke Kahanamoku in the Olympics and got gold medals (in 1920 and 1924 in the 
100-meter backstroke). When he'd play his ukulele at the beach, there might be 
100 people gathered around to hear him, and no one would leave until he'd 
finished. He was a real hero to me, my No. 1 hero. He was hot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pua was in a few movies. He's hang out with a girl named Irish McCalla who 
played Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, on TV. They took me out to breakfast once, 
and I was pretty impressed, sitting there with Pua Kealoha and Sheena of the 
Jungle." 
</P>
<P>
 To please his father, Parlette played football in high school. "I just did it 
because it was expected of me, like going to college later," he said. "My dad 
was a big stud who had played pro football. My brother and I were more like 
nature boys. I couldn't wait to get done with football so I could go hang out 
in the tide pools or go surfing. I'm not a team-oriented guy, which kind of 
works against you in society." 
</P>
<P>
 He first started coming to the rock where he now resides in the late '50s with 
his lifeguard and surfing buddies. Sometimes they'd have a lobster boil in a 
manner they learned from Mexicans they'd met in the Baja, filling a 55-gallon 
drum with lobsters and water and setting it to boil over a burning car tire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back then the lobster-to-human ratio was ideal. The county was still so 
sparsely populated that a car (possibly missing a tire) might only come down 
Laguna Canyon Road once every 10 minutes, instead of the constant torrent of 
them now. Meanwhile, in local waters Parlette could go diving on a single tank 
of oxygen and come up with enough lobsters (then selling at $1 a pound) to pay 
his $50 rent on the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1960, he said, "I was surfing my brains loose, up until 1985," when a 
herniated disc requiring three operations curtailed his aquatic activities for 
a time. He's been doing his sculpting since the late '60s (earlier if one 
counts the tikis he carved for friends as a kid), but doesn't pretend to make a 
living at it, though he still aims to. In the meantime he takes on carpentry 
and odd jobs to get by. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his art celebrates the natural world, from dramatic horse heads to a 
bronze wave and surfer he's crafted as a monument for his friend the famed 
comic surfer Hevs McClelland, who died in 1992. His tikis, which he's sold for 
up to $2,000, haven't earned him much respect form the local art community, but 
to him the grave sculptures are all about respect.  
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling I get when I see one is what islanders call tupuna , a respect 
for ancestors, a way of respect for how they did things, a respect for what's 
been here before you. It says to me that somebody's already been here and done 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rock he lives upon may be something of a weather-hewn sculpture itself, 
but it has it's drawbacks. The stone heats up in the summer and stays hot at 
night, and its a conduit for cold in the winter.  
</P>
<P>
 Raccoons, mice and scorpions stop in for visits, but there haven't been many 
girlfriends on the rock of late. Parlette has never married, and perhaps not 
many people living in caves do.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this house has been an influence on relationships, though," he 
said. "I think it's me that has been, because I'm always going my own direction 
and don't want to take side trips to mini-malls and delis and all that. I just 
want to get out on the beach or in the hills and get some fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a girlfriend here and there, nothing serious. I don't really want to 
live with one. I'm just better being a hermit type of guy." 
</P>
<P>
 One girlfriend did live with him for four years in the tiny space. "We were 
never more than four feet away from each other," he said. He initially built 
the other house on the property with the intent of them moving into it, but he 
wound up balking at the idea of marriage. The woman is now married to his best 
friend.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How has living on a rock alone shaped his thoughts?  
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you have what Zorba called 'the whole catastrophe' -- wife, kids 
and the whole Sheboygan -- you don't have time to contemplate things. Not that 
I have any great thoughts here. My one recurring thought is how much we're 
screwing the planet up.  
</P>
<P>
 "I keep thinking about the tikis on Easter Island (Parlette's next project is 
to carve a couple of fridge-sized ones of his own). They've been there some 
3,000 or 4,000 years, and now in just a few years people have denuded the 
island of trees and everything. That's what is happening to the whole Earth. We 
have to do something about all this breeding going on. Go ahead and have plenty 
of good sex, but you don't have to produce another being every time, because 
we're just flooding the place.  
</P>
<P>
 "The nature I've seen here really influenced my thinking. I'm not 
pro-development on anything. I like the weeds better. This canyon is such a 
tapestry of different colors. To me the most beautiful time here isn't in the 
spring, but right before the rains and rebirth starts. The buckwheat turns a 
rust red, and the mustard when it gets old gets a silver color. It's already 
starting to come back from the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he has no regrets about never opting into a more conventional 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I should die today it would be with a big smile on my face, because of all 
the beautiful things I've seen. If I was making the corporate move to my little 
office in L.A. every day, I wouldn't have been able to catch all those waves or 
watch the little opal eyes and eel grass and critters on the reefs, the leopard 
sharks, everything you see when the water's clear. Those are the memories I 
have in my brain, all-star days."

THE MAN WHO MAKES THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE FIT; MEDICINE: MARK SKOLNICK'S TEAM 
DISCOVERED THE GENE THAT CAUSES INHERITED BREAST CANCER. HE SAYS HE EMPATHIZES 
WITH WHAT THE WOMEN GO THROUGH BECAUSE HE HAS HIS OWN GENETIC DISORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most researchers, a major genetic breakthrough is a once-in-a-lifetime 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Skolnick has had three, two of them just within the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a key player in the mid 1970s in the development of restriction 
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), a crucial technology in identifying 
virtually every disease-causing gene isolated over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 He headed a team that in April announced the discovery of a tumor-suppressor 
gene that may be involved in more than half of all cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 But his masterpiece achievement, and the one that may bring this University of 
Utah researcher his first true measure of fame, came last week when Skolnick 
and his colleagues announced the discovery of the most important gene that 
causes inherited breast cancer. The gene is carried by an estimated 600,000 
U.S. women, 85% of whom will develop the disease by the time they are 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Isolation of the gene, scientists predict, will allow identification of women 
at high risk, allowing them to closely monitor their health to catch the 
disease at an early stage while it is most curable. The discovery also provides 
the first firm information about what causes breast cancer, and should thus 
offer insight into the genesis of non-hereditary breast tumors as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The discovery is an extraordinary advance for cancer research," said fellow 
geneticist Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the week, Skolnick was hoarse from both a bout with bronchitis 
and the incessant telephone and television interviews -- from local TV to 
network morning shows. The excitement, he said, "really pleased" his family, 
which includes two sons, Giancarlo and Joshua Luca, who is named for two of 
Skolnick's mentors. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the jubilation about the new finding, celebrations have been low-key. 
The completion of the paper was marked with low-fat tortilla chips, for 
example, because Skolnick found out this summer that he suffers from his own 
genetic problem, a potentially fatal lipid disorder called Syndrome X that 
leaves him highly susceptible to heart disease. It was identified after doctors 
found that he had sugar in his urine, a kidney stone and other "annoying" 
medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Syndrome X, he said, "kills people in their 40s and 50s." Skolnick is 48. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery of his own genetic disorder has given him new empathy for women who 
have inherited the breast cancer gene, he noted in a telephone interview. It 
has also brought a sharp change in his lifestyle. Although he has always 
enjoyed trips to the desert and hiking and skiing in the nearby Wasatch 
Mountains, the pattern has become more regimented, with daily walks with his 
wife, Angela. He is also on a fat-free diet. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and colleagues who call him an intense and driven researcher in the 
laboratory now use the same words to describe his efforts to take charge of his 
health. Skolnick himself noted proudly that he has "lost 19 pounds in the last 
two months -- no, make that 16. I lost three before I started the diet." 
</P>
<P>
 The Utah mountains he now visits regularly were not, however, what lured this 
self-described "California Jewish boy" to Salt Lake City in 1974 after he 
completed his education at UC Berkeley and Stanford. Rather, it was the large 
Mormon population in Utah and the surrounding states.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mormons represent a unique population, experts agree. They don't smoke and 
they don't drink. They don't often move away from the area, and neither do 
their children. They keep extensive family genealogies. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, they are a dream population for an epidemiologist trying to track 
down genetic diseases. But few geneticists were perceptive enough to recognize 
their potential, and the population lay fallow until Skolnick's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was ahead of his time in terms of his insight in starting to use the 
Mormon pedigrees," said molecular biologist Andy Futreal of the National 
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bold move to leave Berkeley and move out into the desert," added 
Roger Wiseman, Futreal's colleague. "He dedicated many years to collecting the 
families and setting up the Utah Genealogical Data Base," which now contains 
the names of, and critical heath information about, more than 1.3 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Records in the data base can show, for example, how strongly a disease such as 
cancer clusters in particular families and enable researchers to track it over 
several generations. Perhaps most importantly, the registry provides a source 
of blood samples from both affected and unaffected family members that allow 
researchers to use sophisticated molecular biology techniques to isolate genes. 
</P>
<P>
 The data base made the discovery of the breast cancer gene possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that it could have been done anywhere else," said Dr. Randall 
Burt, a medical geneticist at the University of Utah. "It's not that it 
absolutely could not have been done elsewhere. . . . It's just that it would 
have been immensely more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by the data base, more than 100 geneticists have descended on the 
previously sleepy Salt Lake City campus, converting it into a hotbed of genetic 
research that announces genetic discoveries with great regularity. Ironically, 
one who was attracted was Raymond White, the researcher who identified a major 
colon cancer gene. White has been more successful than Skolnick at capturing 
research funds and has a large laboratory in a new building on campus, while 
Skolnick operates out of a research park half a mile out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 White and Skolnick share an intense -- and, colleagues say, a sometimes 
acrimonious -- competition. One of Skolnick's colleagues said his first thought 
on seeing the paper was, "I'll bet White is eating his liver." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are two big fish in a relatively small pond," said geneticist Laurence 
Meyer of the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 White could not be reached for comment, and Skolnick was reluctant to discuss 
the relationship. But he did say that the competition "is not any different 
than other relationships, which are either positive or negative, just the way 
human beings are." 
</P>
<P>
 Skolnick's team is now pursuing a variety of other genes involved in cancer 
and heart disease -- including one newly added to the list, the gene for 
Syndrome X. His 3-year-old company, Myriad Genetics Inc., is also working 
rapidly to develop diagnostic tests for breast cancer and other types of 
cancer, based on the two discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Skolnick is the idea man and synthesizer for the group, the person who 
collects little bits of data produced in the laboratory and puts them together 
into a coherent picture, analyzing, interpreting and predicting. He does little 
laboratory work himself. "I spend most of my time on the telephone," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, said Utah's Meyer, "We are left with a bright guy who has a good, 
balanced life. He works hard, he plays hard. He's been at it a long time, and 
he has stayed on task. This (the breast cancer gene) is just one of several 
fruits he'll be able to pluck."

LIVE AND LEARN; TRADITIONALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT, HOME 
SCHOOLING IS NOW THE CHOICE OF A DIVERSE GROUP OF PARENTS WHO SAY THEIR 
SUCCESSES PROVE EDUCATION DOESN'T HAVE TO STOP IN THE CLASSROOM 
</P>

 Skylar Lenox is almost 8, but she hasn't set foot in a school building since 
preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Skylar spends her time learning what she chooses as one of a growing 
number of secular home-schooled children nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents opted for schooling in their Van Nuys home not to insulate her, 
they said, but rather to introduce her to life firsthand with an education 
drawn from the community. To the Lenox family, this means art classes at a 
museum, reading sessions at the library, piano lessons from a tutor and 
gymnastics at a nonprofit gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not home schooling to keep her sheltered or away from the real world," 
said Skylar's mother, Marsha Lenox. "I want her to retain her love of learning. 
I want her to be her own person and part of the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 As many as half a million children are being educated outside traditional 
schools in the United States, up from 10,000 to 15,000 in the 1970s, according 
to estimates compiled by Patricia Lines, an analyst in the U.S. Department of 
Education's office of Educational Resource and Improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the reasons parents give for choosing home schooling are safety and 
educational concerns, as well as a desire to strengthen the family. Many 
education specialists take no exception to those issues, but they say home 
schooling is not without its own drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, cautioned David D. Marsh, a professor of curriculum and theory 
at the USC School of Education, teaching and parenting do not necessarily draw 
on the same set of skills. Among families who have chosen home schooling, Marsh 
said, "Most have intense commitment -- they just don't have the skills and the 
talent that it takes to be a teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 Home schooling also means a confluence of adult-authority roles, Marsh pointed 
out. "When you are also the parent, I think it's confusing in your mind and in 
the kid's mind, when you're the teacher and when you're the parent. It's a hard 
balance, ethically." 
</P>
<P>
 The 2.2-million member National Education Assn. adopted a platform in 1989 
saying that "home-schooling programs cannot provide the student with a 
comprehensive education experience." 
</P>
<P>
 School districts are charged with enforcement of California's compulsory 
education law, which requires parents who provide home schooling to hold a 
teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet officials in many school districts say a loophole in the law permits the 
practice by non-credentialed parents who file an affidavit stating that they're 
running a private school, said Barbara Beach-Courchesne, a consultant for pupil 
personnel with the Los Angeles County Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Education and the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education take no formal position on home schooling, agency officials said. 
("It's not that we allow it or we don't allow it," said Carolyn Pirillo, staff 
attorney with the state Department of Education. "We don't make value judgments 
about it.") And no state or local agency keeps official estimates of the number 
of home schoolers in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, more parents are attempting to wear both hats, causing the makeup of 
the home schooling population to shift, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones who got the most attention in the mid- to late-1980s were the 
evangelical and fundamental Christians," said Pat Farenga, president of the 
Cambridge, Mass.-based Holt Associates and publisher of Growing Without 
Schooling magazine. "(Today) it's an incredibly diverse group of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Support organizations have formed to serve several religious or ethnic groups, 
he said, ranging from the Jewish Home Educators Newsletter, published in 
Sharon, Mass., to the Drinking Gourd, a newsletter published in Redmond, Wash., 
for African American home-schooling families. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 "I'm having a great time watching my kids grow at this age, which a lot of 
parents don't get to see," said Jim Berrios, a stage builder from Marina del 
Rey who shares the home-schooling duties of his sons, 4 and 6, with his wife, 
Katie O'Neil, a TV producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lot of the little disputes and problems as well as the great findings 
when they discover something new and creative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berrios and his wife initially planned to teach their children at home only 
temporarily. But that goal meant balancing both their careers. After coming up 
with a strategy that sees Berrios working outside the home four months a year 
and O'Neil eight months, they decided home schooling was a viable option for 
their family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been home schooling since the day they were born," Berrios said. "And 
to give this responsibility to a total stranger just didn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Lenox and husband John Thomas Lenox, who works in film and television 
and teaches night classes at UCLA, decided to teach Skylar at home only after 
they became disillusioned with traditional schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to kindergartens at public schools and private schools that people 
would recommend," said Marsha Lenox, who wanted a relaxed, nurturing 
environment for her daughter. "My friends would go to an orientation and think 
it was good school and having missed the orientation, I would go to a class in 
progress and see a different thing."  
</P>
<P>
 Many home schoolers didn't choose it at first, said Terri Endsley, president 
of the Los Angeles-based Home Education League of Parents, known as HELP, a 
national, nonprofit support service organization for secular home-schooling 
families. "It's not something they were looking for. It became the option of 
last choice. But once they get into it, they find it's so exciting and it draws 
the family together in a way they haven't experienced since the children were 
in preschool." 
</P>
<P>
 Home-schooling parents in the area, such as Mary Shannon and her husband, 
Koddy Nuckols, of Kagel Canyon, near Lake View Terrace, say the support groups 
they belong to have grown considerably in recent years and community acceptance 
seems to be improving as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon and Nuckols, a masonry contractor, have never enrolled their sons -- 
Max, 8 and Sam, 6 -- in school. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, like the Lenox and Berrios-O'Neil families, doesn't follow any 
curriculum or structured learning program. Instead, they allow their children 
to explore and develop their interests in a self-directed or interest-led style 
of learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a leap of faith that comes with that, but I trust that they will 
learn, I trust that they will be interested," Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 David Guterson, a high school English teacher in Washington state for 10 years 
and prominent advocate of home schooling, said parents need no special 
educational expertise to teach their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Guterson, who with his wife educates his four children at home, said studies 
that compare the Scholastic Aptitude Test scores of home-schooled youngsters 
with their school peers find not only that home schoolers generally have the 
better scores, but that their parents' level of education appears to have no 
bearing on their success. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tom Ewing, at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., said his 
organization had no data to support claims of higher test scores. Ewing said 
ETS forms do not have a category for home-schooling. "Unfortunately," he added, 
"the very fact that these kids are schooled at home makes it hard to track 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 And while agreeing that in his experience, home-schooled students do tend to 
perform well on standardized tests, Donald W. Oliver, a professor of education 
at Harvard University, said other factors must be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a narrow range of social class that does this," Oliver said of the 
home-school movement. Very few low-income families pursue home schooling, he 
said, and testing well "has never been a problem for middle-class families. No 
matter how they are educated, they always test well." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Guterson, author of the book "Family Matters: Why Homeschooling Makes 
Sense" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1992), has concerns about educating children 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools in theory operate for some kind of social cohesion and potentially 
home schooling could be a divisive force that tears at the social fabric," he 
said. "People who have problems with mainstream values such as diversity and 
multiculturalism may find home schooling a way to keep their children from 
being exposed to . . . all values but their own and that is truly dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he insisted: "All parents are extremely well-qualified to educate their 
children, given the commitment to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Guterson said a common misperception about home schooling is that it requires 
the parents do all the teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what it's about," he said. "It's about children learning in the 
world in many different situations." 
</P>
<P>
 That can mean enrolling the children in community education programs. Other 
times it's as simple as taking the children along on the regular household 
errands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even those families who opt for a more structured, academic curriculum say 
they often have ample free time each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony and Alizon Harris, Westside parents of two sons, ages 5 and 9, and a 
daughter, 2, follow an academic lesson plan for their two oldest children. 
</P>
<P>
 Alizon, the daughter of a teacher who supports her home-schooling decision, 
decided to keep her children out of school because she believed public schools 
weren't safe and the private schools she visited were too academically intense. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were for the most part very pushy in education and wanted the kids to do 
things too early and too quickly," she said, echoing concerns shared by many 
home-schooling parents. "I want my kids to read early if they want to read 
early, but not to be forced into it." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her children have seemed to flourish in the relaxed educational 
surrounding of their home. 
</P>
<P>
 While critics voice concern about sheltered children, many parents who keep 
their children out of school say their youngsters have many more opportunities 
for healthy, social development than is offered in school, where children are 
grouped into age categories that often don't mix with those who are younger and 
older. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get out of school, you're not dealing with just people your own age 
who share your interests," Lenox said. "You have to deal with a wide range of 
people age-wise and culturally, and these kids are already doing it. They're 
already out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Most home-schooled children do end up in school at some point, however, 
Guterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of home-schooling families eventually quit before their child 
leaves home as an adult," he said. "As kids reach high school age they are 
socially tantalized by school . . . with dating and the need for contact of a 
romantic nature being the primary draw." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Guterson's 13-year-old son is planning on trying school next year as 
a high school freshman, and his middle son, 10 1/2, has already tasted a 
semester of school. "He went, excelled and had a great time, but by Christmas 
he had decided he preferred home schooling," Guterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several recent studies have reflected favorably on home schooling, including a 
1991 University of Michigan survey of adults who had been home schooled. It 
found that such children are socially well-adjusted and show substantially 
fewer behavior problems than those educated in traditional schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Most colleges and universities have experience with home-schooled applicants 
and will consider them for admission. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Allen, dean of admissions at the USC, said applications from home-schooled 
students are so uncommon that they must be reviewed and judged individually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every case is different," said Allen, adding that for home-schooled 
students, scholastic aptitude and achievement tests often take on greater 
weight. Allen said confirmation of a home-schooled student's work also becomes 
important because "in the end, what we want to judge is the student's ability 
to function in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the office of undergraduate admissions at UCLA said that 
institution also receives very few applications from home-schooled students. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Logistic arrangements among home schooling families vary. In some families, 
one parent stays home full-time with the children. But many dual-work couples 
have managed to home school as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common of these arrangements, Farenga, of Holt Associates, said, is 
the split shift -- with one parent who works during the day and the other at 
night. Then there are those parents who telecommute or have home-based 
businesses that allow them to work around their family activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the setup, most parents agree that support groups are essential. 
Oliver, at the Harvard School of Education, concurred, noting that 
"home-schoolers tend to be very creative in the way they ally with other 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Endsley's HELP chapter charges a $25 annual fee and provides members with a 
calendar of activities that usually include two home-schooling events each week 
in the L.A. area. 
</P>
<P>
 It also helps parents find support groups, which usually offer regular play 
days for the children, organized classes, field trips, co-op child care and 
evenings out for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Lenox said that involvement with the Burbank-based Mountain View Park 
Homeschoolers has opened up numerous educational opportunities for Skylar, who 
recently created a volunteer organization she's dubbed Home Schoolers Helping 
the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "The common attitude is that kids don't know what's best for themselves," 
Lenox said. "If we stop projecting our own wishes and desires on children, they 
do know what's best for them. They know what their own needs are and that's 
what I like about home schooling."

 After a focused workout with my horse, I felt a slight sensation on my arm. I 
looked down just in time to see the yellow-butt end of a wasp flying off in the 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked the barn owner if she had an antidote that would minimize the 
swelling. She quickly brought a hypodermic needle from her arsenal of medical 
supplies for the animals and spread a few drops of a steroid on my arm. She 
said it was harmless. She then gave me the hypo to go and sent me on my way. 
</P>
<P>
 As I headed home, my right eye began to tear. A hot, itchy, burning sensation 
began to spread over my body like a wet wool blanket. I began to scratch 
violently. 
</P>
<P>
 I stopped at a fast-food restaurant and made a beeline for the bathroom. I 
splashed cool water on my face, which gave no relief. I lifted my shirt and 
discovered that my entire upper body was red and blotchy. I felt nauseated and 
lightheaded. 
</P>
<P>
 I stumbled to my car to call the barn owner. After many ringy-dingies, I gave 
up. Totally disoriented now, I rushed back to the bathroom, hoping that was a 
safe place to pass out. That's when, to my shock, I looked in the mirror and 
saw someone I did not know. 
</P>
<P>
 My face had visibly grown like a time-lapse photography flower. At this rate 
of expansion, my flesh would soon be tearing from my skull. I remember uttering 
an "Oh, my God" as I felt my nose, which by now had spread across my face. My 
upper lip was puffed and felt hard. My eyes had turned turquoise with blood red 
rims. I started to faint, but was able to catch myself. 
</P>
<P>
 I staggered into the dining lounge, slumped onto a seat and put my head 
between my legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you OK?" asked a friendly muncher. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm not. Wasp sting." 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd was gathering. Two women with their young children looked on with 
growing alarm.  
</P>
<P>
 "She should get a doctor!" one shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 I agreed that would be nice and indicated that if someone could get me to the 
emergency ward, it would be great. The Friendly Muncher seemed to care and 
stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't take her in your car," he told the women. "What if she passes out 
on the way?" 
</P>
<P>
 It had come to this. A well-meaning woman couldn't help me because there was 
no guarantee I wouldn't die or, worse, do anything messy on the way to the 
hospital. I was a pariah, an untouchable, no darned good. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muncher offered to call 911. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks," I moaned. "Why don't you do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 I still wasn't sure what was happening to me. My symptoms were subsiding, but 
I could barely swallow a drink of water and my shirt was soaked with 
perspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 The paramedics arrived immediately and administered oxygen. It did alleviate a 
great deal of the unsteadiness. Even though I thought I might vomit and my 
bowels were in a hard little knot, I was not dizzy anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 I insisted on telling the paramedics about the hypo in the car. I was afraid 
that the steroid had caused the reaction. I did not want them to treat me for 
the wrong problem. One of the paramedics went to my car and brought the needle 
into the restaurant -- to the horror of all my newfound allies. 
</P>
<P>
 They gasped when he placed the needle on the table. They could only assume 
that I was a drug-crazed, middle-aged athlete who needed this to make it 
through her day. Their once kindly demeanors vanished and were replaced with 
shock and disgust. I could not speak with the oxygen mask over my mouth to 
explain. I was grateful to be hoisted onto the gurney and to get out of there. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambulance jockey said, "You look awfully red." 
</P>
<P>
 I could only imagine the prize-winning beefsteak tomato size of my face. I 
wondered if my head was about to blow sky-high. He inserted the oxygen in my 
nose to cool me down. I was beginning to feel cynical about the whole ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, what will the doctor do besides tell me to drink lots of liquids and get 
plenty of rest?" 
</P>
<P>
 "They can do lots of things," he explained. "If your lungs are so constricted 
that your breathing becomes labored, they can give you a shot for that. If your 
heart starts to palpitate, they can reverse that before it kills you. They can 
give you drugs to relieve the itching and the rash." 
</P>
<P>
 It hadn't occurred to me that I might die from a sting. Although it had 
crossed my mind that I might rather be dead than greet each day with the sight 
of the face I'd seen in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 No expense would be spared. 
</P>
<P>
 When we arrived, I was attended to immediately by a kindly nurse who asked a 
lot of questions. I told her that I had been stung before and that this had not 
occurred. She explained that the effect of bee, yellow jacket and wasp bites 
and stings is cumulative. The old poison was still in my system and this recent 
incident had put enough toxin into my body to bring this on. I showed her the 
hypo. She was only mildly interested. Apparently, I had all the classic 
symptoms of a sting victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor soon came and he dittoed the nurse's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll give you a shot of Benadryl along with a shot of adrenaline. That ought 
to take care of this." 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner said than done, I was left to rest. Within 10 minutes, I began to 
shake violently. Assuming it was the cold from the air conditioning that was 
causing me to quake, I moaned to the doctor for a blanket. He handed me a thin 
sheet and said I was experiencing a typical reaction from the drugs he had 
given me. After sleeping it off for about an hour, I was able to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, I experienced lumps, bumps and a rash that covered my buttocks and 
went well down my thighs. It was gone in the morning thanks to a little help 
from modern science in the form of 50 milligrams of Benadryl. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that this Achilles heel is with me for life. Gone are the days of 
lollygagging around the barn, oblivious to the perils of nature. I have trashed 
all my colorful print shirts left over from Hawaiian holidays and stick to the 
basic grays and earth tones that insects find boring. I no longer wear scented 
deodorant or hair spray, and would not dream of patting on some heavenly scent 
on the days I plan to go to the barn. 
</P>
<P>
 I have given up picnic lunches at the barn. The smell of any kind of food 
serves as a magnet to yellow jackets. When I dine on outdoor patios, I wear a 
color-coordinated fly swatter clipped to my belt. I'm convinced that the best 
defense is a good offense against insects that cross social boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The only comment I've received since swatting in public has been "good eye."

MYTHBUSTERS: BODY WATCH; ACHES, PAINS AND WEATHER

 It was the kind of health information you never questioned. After all, it came 
froman authority -- not your doctor, but from your mom, your grandpa or maybe 
even your pal who once dated a med student. From time to time, we'll look at 
these long-held health "facts" and answer the question -- sorry, Mom -- true or 
false? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When joints ache, it means rain or some other weather change is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 True. "Doctors who have been in practice a while hear this too many times to 
dismiss it totally," says Dr. David Horwitz, chief of rheumatology at USC 
School of Medicine. Although he's not aware of a definitive study, Horwitz says 
there just might be something to it when people say they can feel weather 
changes in their bones. People might be sensitive to the barometric pressure 
changes, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "My patients are much better predictors of the weather than some weathermen," 
adds Dr. Robin Dore, an Anaheim rheumatologist and UCLA assistant clinical 
professor of medicine. "It's true, your joints can ache when there's going to 
be a change in the weather, such as rain or a temperature change. In areas 
where there are lots of changes in barometric pressure, researchers have shown 
that people have more flare-ups with their arthritis." 
</P>

<P>
 If you can move an injured finger or toe, that means it is not broken. 
</P>
<P>
 False, says Dr. Charles Resnick, hand surgeon at Orthopaedic Hospital, Los 
Angeles, and USC assistant clinical professor of orthopedics. Even if an 
appendage can be moved, it might very well be fractured, Resnick says. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients often ask him, "So why can I still move it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Explains Resnick: "Even when the bone is broken, muscles and tendons can still 
be attached and the bone can still function, at least partially." 
</P>
<P>
 After a fracture, it can take time for pain to set in, he says, because it 
follows the leaking of blood and other substances from the injury point. 
</P>
<P>
 Resnick's rule of thumb when trying to decide whether an injury needs medical 
attention: "If your finger (or anything else) goes off in a direction it 
normally does not go, assume it is fractured or dislocated until proven 
otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 If still in doubt? 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't hurt to get an X-ray." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If a cold gets too bad, it could turn into pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 False, says Dr. John Dalton, a pulmonologist and medical director of 
respiratory therapy at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Most normal, healthy people with colds do not go on to get pneumonia, he says. 
Pneumonia, a lung infection, can be caused by viruses, bacteria or other 
organisms. 
</P>
<P>
 An individual weakened by a cold might then be more susceptible to pneumonia, 
Dalton says, but even that "occurs infrequently." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with lowered resistance -- such as elderly diabetics, people with AIDS 
or those with emphysema -- should consider getting vaccinated against 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cracking the knuckles makes them bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 False. "There are no known detrimental effects to cracking the knuckles -- 
except, of course, irritating your spouse or parents," says Dr. David Mesna, 
orthopedic surgeon at Kaiser Permanente, Woodland Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 "But it does not lead to bigger knuckles or to degenerative changes. And a lot 
of times it makes the joint feel better," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For some people, cracking the knuckles is a nervous habit, Mesna says. He 
doesn't notice that women are more likely than men to crack knuckles or vice 
versa.

DOWNTIME: BODY WATCH; A WALK ON THE BOULEVARD MAKES LIFE SO PRECIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was 69, I had cancer surgery. Up to then I did not know what "downtime" 
meant.The doctor advised me to walk as much as I could. In the beginning, I 
could walk only a few short blocks. Three years later I am walking three times 
a day and go much farther. Sunset Boulevard is my regular beat. Dog walkers, 
gardeners and postmen recognize me. I am getting stronger and healthier. My 
greatest pleasure is when I combine walking with garage sales on weekends. I 
now have enough paperbacks to last me into the next century.

 * If you are stung, scrape the stinger out. Do not squeeze with tweezers or 
with your fingers because that will force more venom into your system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wash the area with soap and water, apply a cold compress and cover with a 
topical steroid such as Cortaid. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you are hypersensitive, the first sting serves to sensitize your immune 
system to the venom. A subsequent sting -- perhaps months, even a year later -- 
will trigger a severe allergic reaction. The symptoms may include a severe 
itchy rash, dizziness, facial and throat swelling, wheezing, vomiting, 
breathing difficulties and collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you know that you are hypersensitive, wear an identification bracelet and 
carry an anaphylaxis kit. This is a self-injection device that requires a 
prescription and consists of a syringe pre-loaded with just the right dose of 
adrenaline. Make sure you know how to use it, and practice giving yourself 
"dummy" shots before you are bitten. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your are bitten, don't wait to see what happens; inject yourself 
immediately and go to the nearest emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you can't tolerate the thought of being vulnerable for life, consult an 
allergist. You can be injected repeatedly with venom until your body builds up 
an immunity. This normally takes about five years. The cure may sound worse 
than the problem, but it depends on how much time you spend outdoors; the more 
time outside, the greater the risk of an incident that could be fatal. LINDA

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; MOONLIGHT ROUNDS UP BEST OF THE WEST; THE DESIGNING 
WOMEN AND OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE ART INSTITUTE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA KICK UP 
THEIR HEELS.

<P>
 From fluorescent-colored coyotes to glittering cowgirls, the Old West got a 
new look thanks to the artistic talents of the Designing Women of the Art 
Institute of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 guests in creative country-Western garb attended the Designing 
Women's "Moonlight Roundup" Saturday at the Smithcliffs Estates in Laguna 
Beach. The $100-per-person gala, which included line dancing, barbecue and 
entertainment straight out of the Wild West, was expected to net $25,000 for 
the Laguna Beach-based institute. Lasso the Moon 
</P>
<P>
 Although Smithcliffs Estates is currently a collection of empty oceanfront 
lots, the creative minds of Designing Women transformed it into a rancho 
complete with dance floor, stage and dining hall. They set up a huge white tent 
adorned with haystacks and colorful Western murals and covered the floor with 
sawdust and gold glitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted something a little more exciting than the typical country-Western 
party," said Caren Chatham-Heller, event chairwoman. "This is still 
country-Western, but it's a lot more fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, under a nearly full moon, guests could practice their line dancing to 
the down-home music of Free Reign. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside they sat at tables adorned with coyotes, jack rabbits and cacti painted 
in Day-Glo hues and sparkling with glitter. The Vegas-meets-Bonanza decor was 
the work of Doretta Ensign, one of the artistic committee members, who outshone 
everyone in a head-to-toe gold cowgirl outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the original gold-digger," she joked. She sported gold cowboy boots, a 
sparkling gold jacket and a cowboy hat she'd spray-painted gold to match her 
metallic ensemble. Food and Spirit 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's festivities included an old-fashioned barbecue of ribs, steak, 
marinated chicken, cole slaw and beans. After dinner, hired gun Jim Dunham of 
Tempe, Ariz. demonstrated his quick draw and other gun tricks used in movies 
such as "Tombstone," on which he served as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the time I was in high school I wanted to be the fastest gun in the 
world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests also hooted and hollered when seven men, all institute supporters, came 
out on the dance floor dressed as cancan girls, kicking up their heels and 
flashing their boxer shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The gala was held in honor of Constance Morthland, a founding member of 
Designing Women, who talked about the group's early days under the leadership 
of the late Muriel Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always thought that some day there will be more artists in Orange 
County than were in the Italian Renaissance," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the gala support the institute, a specialized, accredited 
college of art and design. 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests were Patty Truman, president of Designing Women; Glenn and Marsha 
Bianchi, Boyd and Bibi Davis, Oscar and Alison Frenzel, Jane Grier, Arthur and 
Jackie Jacobson, Leon and Molly Lyon, Jack and Jan Massimino, Michael and Susan 
McFadden, Pamela O'Neill, Tom and Mary Catherine Payne, Tom and Barbara 
Peckinpaugh, Bill and Hillary Price, Peg Reday, Philip and Laurie Reed, Shirley 
Thayer, Sandy and Harold Price, John and Nancee Weingarden and Sandra and 
Lawrence Wessel. KATHRYN BOLD

BODY WATCH; LOOPHOLE ALLOWS HOME SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California's compulsory education law technically doesn't allow parents 
without a teaching credential to educate their children at home. Yet the state 
is considered among the least regulated in the nation when it comes to home 
schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Beach-Courchesne, a consultant for pupil personnel with the Los 
Angeles County Office of Education, said families within the jurisdiction of 
L.A. County schools can home school by taking advantage of what she and others 
statewide consider to be a loophole in California law. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, uncredentialed parents who want to educate their children at 
home can file a private school affidavit with the county education office 
stating that they are running a private school. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, Beach-Courchesne said, they are able to sidestep the credentialing 
requirement, which does not apply to private-school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who follow this procedure are free to choose whatever education style 
suits them -- from packaged curriculums and rigid schedules to an unstructured 
blend of activities guided by the child's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 But like more traditional private schools, parents are required to assign 
grades, keep attendance, and keep their homes open to annual fire and health 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining the size of the home schooling population is difficult because no 
agency keeps count. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, there are about 300 private schools registered for six 
or fewer students, "and I would make a presumption they are parents choosing to 
educate children in their homes by establishing private schools," 
Beach-Courchesne said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other families teach through independent study programs and many more, it 
is estimated, simply don't file the forms. STEPHANIE O'NEILL
