 King to Simulcast 'Live': Talk-show mainstay Larry King is drastically cutting 
back his radio air time and will instead nationally simulcast his influential 
hourlong cable TV show, CNN's "Larry King Live," beginning June 6. The nightly 
6 p.m. program will replace his three-hour syndicated afternoon radio 
broadcast, which is heard on San Diego's KCEO-AM (1000). Which radio stations 
will carry the simulcast was not announced. King, 60, will do his last 
afternoon show on May 27; starting June 13 the slot will be filled by "The 
David Brenner Show," starring the stand-up comedian and former "Tonight Show" 
guest host. King, a 16-year radio veteran who instituted the first national 
radio talk show in 1978, will continue to broadcast "My Side of the Story," a 2 
1/2-minute daily radio feature currently heard on 430 stations. He also plans a 
series of radio specials. 
</P>
<P>
 * Broadcasts Canceled: Citing "serious misgivings about the appropriateness of 
(giving air time to) a convicted murderer seeking a new trial," National Public 
Radio made an 11th-hour decision Monday not to air commentaries by condemned 
police killer Mumia Abu-Jamal. The commentaries had been scheduled to begin 
airing Monday night on NPR's "All Things Considered." TELEVISION

 Letterman's Finish Line: David Letterman's weeklong Los Angeles stand boosted 
his overall ratings 72% with local audiences, while rival Jay Leno's ratings 
dropped 20% on his home turf. Letterman averaged 370,473 local viewing homes 
for the week, while Leno drew only about 155,211. In the top 31 markets, 
Letterman's "Late Show" was up 11% for the week, while "The Tonight Show" 
dropped 6%. The L.A. visit brought Letterman his fourth-highest-rated week on 
CBS, behind the "Late Show's" premiere week and the two Winter Olympics weeks. 
On Monday, Leno began his own cross-country broadcasts -- from Letterman's home 
base of New York.

 * 'Bridge' Goes Cable: The defunct, multiple Emmy-winning series "Brooklyn 
Bridge" is the latest critically acclaimed show to be picked up by Bravo's "TV 
Too Good for TV" showcase. The half-hour series kicks off its cable run Aug. 22 
with a five-day marathon of all 35 episodes. On Aug. 29 it starts in its 
regular time slot, weeknights at 7. The program, an autobiographical account of 
creator Gary David Goldberg's childhood in the '50s, originally aired on CBS 
from 1991 to 1993. . . . Also returning via cable is CBS' long-running 
nighttime soap, "Knots Landing," which will air weekdays at 8 a.m. on TNT. All

 LuPone, Lloyd Webber Settle: Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group and 
actress Patti LuPone's attorney said they reached a settlement "of all 
disputes" regarding LuPone's contract to appear in the Broadway production of 
Lloyd Webber's musical, "Sunset Boulevard." LuPone originated the role of Norma 
Desmond in London last July, but Glenn Close, who is currently playing Desmond 
in Los Angeles, was selected to take that role to Broadway. LuPone's attorney 
said: "The Really Useful Group have been very fair to Patti . . . and we are 
satisfied with the outcome." LuPone said, "I will always take pride in having 
created the role of Norma Desmond on the musical stage. Now it is time to get 
on with the rest of my life." LuPone, on vacation in the Caribbean, will appear 
at the Hollywood Bowl July 2-4 in a tribute to Irving Berlin.

 * Alexander's First Grants: California will receive nearly $7.8 million of the 
$78 million in federal National Endowment for the Arts grants announced Monday. 
Among the largest local awards are $241,000 to the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
Assn., $107,000 to the Music Center Opera Assn., $95,000 to the Bella Lewitzky 
Dance Foundation, $70,000 each to the L.A. Chamber Orchestra Society and Aman 
Folk Ensemble, about $63,000 each to the L.A. County and Santa Monica museums 
of art, and a $20,000 fellowship to jazz musician Carmen McRae. The midyear 
grants, the first approved under new chairwoman Jane Alexander, also include 
performance fellowships to Tim Miller and Holly Hughes, two of the so-called 
"NEA 4," who sued the NEA for denying them grants four years ago, as well as 
grants to Santa Monica's Highways and New York's Franklin Furnace, which were 
denied previous grants allegedly because of the controversial nature of their 
programming. QUICK TAKES

 Up-and-coming Pennsylvania quartet Live easily transcended the dingy basement 
quality of Raji's on Sunday night with an uplifting set of punk-pop that proved 
both poignant and powerful. Without a doubt, Live's secret weapon is vocalist 
Ed Kowalczyk, a thoughtful and talented singer-songwriter flourishing in a 
group context.On its two albums, Live often shows a resemblance to R.E.M., with 
intense, low-key, well-crafted songs coupled with intelligent, provocative 
lyrics. In concert, though, Kowalczyk exudes a quietly intense charm that helps 
the band's dynamic material come to life. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kowalczyk and solid, aggressive drummer Chad Gracey proved a strong 
team, the group's guitarist, Chad Taylor, and bassist, Patrick Dahlheimer, were 
workmanlike at best, not fully holding up their part of the musical bargain.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, not much could disturb the appealing candor of the songs from Live's 
latest "Throwing Copper" album, notably the compelling "All Over You" and the 
warm and edgy "Selling the Drama." KATHERINE TURMAN

ART REVIEW; 'BETROTHALS': HOW GORKY BRIDGED GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arshile Gorky occupied an awkward but heroic slot in the development of 
contemporary American art. His historical job was to bridge the gap between two 
opposing conceptions of the landscape of the subconscious. Now we can see how 
he pulled it off in a fascinating small didactic show at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Gorky's Betrothals" it was organized in tandem by curators Paul 
Schimmel at MOCA and Klaus Kertess at New York's Whitney Museum of American 
Art. It's a rare colloquium of three versions of Gorky's pivotal late painting 
of 1947 "Betrothal." Shown along with eight studies, they provide an 
illuminating look at how the artist combined academic methodology with 
irrational inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Vosdanik Adoian in Armenia in 1904, Gorky emigrated to the U.S. in 1920. 
Since all he wanted from life was to be a great artist, he took a pseudonym and 
gave interviews posing as a relative of the Russian writer Maxim Gorky (itself 
a pseudonym.) Pennilessness was the standard condition for advanced artists of 
Gorky's generation, but 20 years of ferociously concentrated work did gain him 
the cognoscenti's critical admiration. The fates were less kind. In 1946 his 
studio burned, destroying 27 paintings. In 1948 an auto accident broke his neck 
and immobilized his painting arm. Shortly, his wife left taking both children. 
A month later Gorky hanged himself after writing, "Goodbye My Loveds" on a 
wooden picture crate in white chalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorky's character imbued his art with an agonized sense of romantic 
melancholy. These 11 examples show that he was a slow and systematic worker who 
lingered like a languorous lover unwilling to part from the beloved until 
achieving perfect satiation. He wanted the end result to look mysteriously 
spontaneous. Twenty years ago it did, but time can do funny things to 
perception. 
</P>
<P>
 Working like Ingres, the great French academician whom he admired, Gorky did 
numerous preparatory drawing studies, laying out general ideas in progressively 
more detail until he tacked down composition and expression. (One early version 
includes a graphic pair of female breasts that are more oblique in finished 
results.) Finally he gridded a study for enlargement, then executed it on 
canvas to see how it looked at full scale. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, Gorky's larger formula was simple. European Cubism had tended to 
flatten form and space. Picasso's style evolved this way, as did Miro's 
abstract surrealism. Its biomorphic shapes suggested all manner of viscera, but 
they were executed more or less like paper cutouts. Gorky's aim was, in a 
sense, more realistic. He wanted to express the tangibility of wet forms in 
softly atmospheric surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently discovered version of "Betrothal" belonging to Yale University 
has a lovely pensive, gray liquidity that treats oil like watercolor. Like the 
rest, it is made up of ambiguous forms suggesting things from bulbous mushrooms 
to delicate music stands to the vagina dentata. MOCA's "Betrothal I" sets a 
palette of delicately nuanced earth tones drifting foggily around blue-gray 
entities. The Whitney's "Betrothal II" is more filled-in, almost sculptural and 
noticeably more polished. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the work looks over-calculated and a little oily in its desire to 
please. Popular culture has long since taken over Gorky's actors and turned 
them into progressively more cuddly science-fiction monsters so his works now 
hint of kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
 These are things one notices rather than things that wreck the work. They are 
signs that Gorky's pictorial language is not spoken that way any longer, it has 
entered the realm of stylization. When that happens there is a perceptual speed 
bump. It will smooth out over time until Gorky is no harder to read than Ingres 
or Henry James.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; SPAIN'S RAPHAEL LET THE MUSIC SPEAK FOR ITSELF AT UNIVERSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only truly great singers don't even need to chat a little with their audience 
in order to communicate. And Spain's Raphael, by letting nothing interfere with 
his singing in a two-hour, 30-song show at the Universal Amphitheatre on Sunday 
-- proved himself to be among the truly great. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the 51-year-old singer began his professional career when he was 14 and 
has been a star performer since the mid-'60s -- he's still known as " El Nino " 
("The Child") -- Sunday he showed that he has plenty of vocal arsenal left. In 
fact, few Latin pop singers today can vocally compete with this man, who still 
looks young and has the powerful tenor voice that can suddenly shift from a 
sweet croon to a more passionate Andalusian style. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are his trademark antics -- exaggerating the emotional impact 
that the songs have on him, stomping off the stage "moved" by a number while 
the orchestra keeps going, and standing right in front of the audience for 
about 20 seconds after each song, begging for applause and pretending to be 
crying. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't have to beg. The audience stood after each song, even the disposable 
new material from his latest album (his 74th!), despite the lifelessness of 
Raphael's nine-piece orchestra. Nobody cared -- Raphael was there, and that's 
all that mattered. ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; GEORGE STRAIT STILL AIMS TO PLEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NOEL DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why has George Strait remained at the top of country music for more than a 
dozen years, when so many others have come and gone? 
</P>
<P>
 In his 90-minute show at the Pond in Anaheim on Sunday, Strait answered that 
question with his good solid country music, astute song selection and, more 
than anything else, by the fact that he was there at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The date was a makeup of Strait's April 29 concert at the Pond, which he 
canceled after nine songs because a cold was affecting his voice. How many 
performers would have simply croaked out a few more songs, grabbed the money 
and ran? 
</P>
<P>
 Strait, however, was determined to give his fans their money's worth. Backed 
by his excellent eight-piece Ace in the Hole Band, Strait delivered on his 
promise with a 24-song set that combined his hits with the Western swing music 
that is the foundation of his traditional style. 
</P>
<P>
 Strait played many of his biggest hits, including "The Chair," "Ocean Front 
Property" and "Amarillo by Morning," but he kept the set from being too 
predictable by also including several of the non-hits from his two latest 
albums, "Pure Country" and "Easy Come, Easy Go," and with solid tributes to his 
biggest influences, Merle Haggard and Bob Wills. NOEL DAVIS

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; TROUBLED CHAMBER MUSIC/LA FORGES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the realm of concert life, chamber music sometimes tends to be an 
endangered species, an intimate pleasure worth savoring and supporting. That 
point was well-represented on Sunday afternoon at the Japan America Theater, 
where Chamber Music/LA put on its only concert of the season -- and that a 
benefit for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming natural and fiscal calamities as the causes for this hiatus, the 
organization hopes to garner resources for a full season next year, just in 
time to celebrate its 10th anniversary. Let's hope so: Rome may burn and shake, 
and the recession may smolder, but chamber music must prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 In a romantic-leaning program, the best came first. Mozart's Viola Quintet in 
E-flat, K. 614, was resplendent, with a cogent collective voice from violinists 
Christiaan Bor and Paul Rosenthal, violists Milton Thomas and Marcus Thompson 
and cellist Nathaniel Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving from classical poise to the purpler hue of romantic passion, Franck's 
Sonata in A proved a choice foil for pianist Mari Kodama and violinist Yukiko 
Kamei. Kamei, also Chamber Music/LA's artistic director, boasted a sumptuous 
tone and assured technique. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Kodama deftly rose to the occasion of Dvorak's Piano 
Quintet in A, Opus 81, for which the composer appropriated folk material. It's 
a work of mercurial temperament, now joyful, now rueful, with emotional content 
presented up close and personal. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the performance, the musicians on hand worked well, individually 
and in concert. All was well in the chamber. JOSEF WOODARD

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; 'FLAMENCO TALAVERA' TROUPE IN BREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some measure of success can be assumed for a Flamenco program when the 
audience in the underground parking lot afterward cannot resist clapping wildly 
in furious rhythms and looking for all the world as if by drumming their heels 
into the pavement they could bring parked cars to life. The Saturday night 
performance of "Flamenco Talavera" at Curtis Theatre in Brea had that effect, 
even though technical difficulties occasionally interfered. 
</P>
<P>
 A primary pleasure of Flamenco is the sound of its complex, fickle rhythms as 
feet contact floor. When the dance surface is cardboard-like (actually coming 
apart at the seams), and it is not miked, while the singer and guitar are, 
percussive accents are lost. Fortunately, several sections of the mixed program 
occurred in silence, allowing the dancers to recapture their power. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest dancers Linda Andrade and Antonia Lopez had spirited moments, as did 
several of the company's regular members; Marcellina de Luna and Maruja 
Belmonte in the danced drama "Amor Gitano" come to mind, with their torrid 
lunges and arched postures of suspicion and desire. In general, the company is 
fine in footwork and the lace and steel movements of hands twisting on wrists, 
but often lacks the strong spines that support and coordinate Flamenco 
flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not apply, however, to Juan Talavera, whose riveting presence never 
failed to excite. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows how to create power with a burning focus, whether it's centered in 
the drama of his chiseled face, or somewhere in the length of his taut torso, 
or especially in the smoldering finesse with which he makes transitions, from 
cool to hot, from diminishing heel taps to rapid-fire circling of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping pace with the dancers -- and sometimes setting it with evocative 
flourishes -- were singer Jesus Montoya and guitarist Benito Palacios. * 
"Flamenco Talavera" presents a mixed program, May 20 and 21 at 8:30 p.m., at 
Curtis Theatre, 1 Civic Center Drive, Brea. Guest guitarists are Antonio Triana 
and Rafael Aragon. Guest dancers Cintia Reyes and Gabriela Garza will join 
guests mentioned above. Tickets $19.50. Information: (714) 990-7722. JENNIFER

TV REVIEWS; KIDS' SAFETY TIPS ON 'STRANGER DANGER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Children and the elderly are society's most vulnerable, and childhood in 
particular seems to be an increasingly dangerous proposition: guns in school, 
drugs, abuse -- and kidnaping the subject of tonight's Nick News special, 
"Stranger Danger," hosted by reporter and kids' advocate Linda Ellerbee. 
</P>
<P>
 With characteristic calm, Ellerbee stresses that the object of the show is not 
to frighten but to address children's real fears, sparked by recent, tragic, 
headline-making cases.She is joined by a group of children, one of whom saved 
herself from becoming a victim by faking an asthma attack, and Ernie Allen, 
director of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
</P>
<P>
 The fathers of kidnap/murder victims Polly Klaas and Sara Ann Wood speak on 
tape and scenarios are played on video to show children how to react to various 
approaches used by abductors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the situations are not so obvious. One ploy finds a kidnaper 
confronting a child alone in a store, pretending to be a security officer. 
Another pretends a child's parent has been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Too much focus on the negative? Although the show stresses that it will never 
happen to most children, each year 4,600 are abducted by strangers. Allen notes 
that children tend to think of strangers as scary-looking people, while most 
abductors look like anybody else and often disarm children by learning their 
names and making friendly overtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, most of those taken do return home again, but even one loss is too 
many. The show's premise is that kids have a right to knowledge that can help 
them stay safe. Communication is key; parents can help by using the show as a 
springboard for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Stranger Danger" airs at 8 tonight on Nickelodeon and repeats Sunday at 8 
p.m.

TV REVIEWS; AN IMAGINATIVE 'SEARCH FOR GRACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Search for Grace" runs against the grain of most prime-time movies, 
cloaking the mysterious present in a haunting sense of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 A young woman (Lisa Hartman Black) is periodically hurled into fainting spells 
when she hears the sound of rushing water or sees a pair of spiky, high-heeled 
red shoes.They are images from the life of another woman long dead who, under 
the opening credits, we see thrown over Niagara Falls by a murderous lover (Ken 
Wahl). 
</P>
<P>
 Are network movies growing up, shedding their tiresome dependence on true-life 
headlines for something different? Well, not too different -- even this fantasy 
carries the TV movie holy mantra: "Inspired by an actual case history." 
</P>
<P>
 At least "The Search for Grace," directed by Sam Pillsbury and written by Alex 
Ayres, advances the cause of imagination. It's the ticket for viewers who like 
time-lapse mental trips, stories that deal in hypnosis and (pardon the 
psych-speak) "delayed stress syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who admired the 1980 theatrical motion picture "Somewhere in Time" with 
Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour should like this movie, although be 
forewarned: This journey (in which "Grace" stands for both an epiphany and the 
name of the past-life victim) is not about rekindling an old incandescent love; 
it's about the mistakes we all keep repeating. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Search for Grace" airs at 9 tonight on CBS (Channels 2 and 8). RAY

 Laid bare: In reporting that Caltrans had renamed a street near Gorman after 
Smokey the Bear, we recalled -- with some sadness -- the incompatibility of the 
real-life Smokey and his mate, Goldie. The couple produced no offspring and, in 
1975, during Smokey's otherwise dignified retirement ceremony in Washington, 
D.C., Goldie reportedly even took a swing at him. 
</P>
<P>
 This prompted a note from John Webster of Rancho Palos Verdes, who enclosed a 
possible explanation for their problems in the form of a cartoon from an old 
issue of Playboy magazine. It depicted an amorous-minded Smokey being pushed 
away by his spouse, who growls:

 Always ready to take on a hot potatoe: Former Vice President Dan Quayle will 
be one of the guests this morning at a conference about political humor titled, 
"Do Conservatives Have a Sense of Humor?" 
</P>
<P>
 The event is at that Simi Valley laugh factory -- the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle, who has a new book out, has been very visible lately and we think we 
know why. During the 1992 presidential campaign, he was asked by CNN's Bernard 
Shaw about his own presidential prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle responded: "Let us see George Bush reelected . . . and then we'll talk 
about 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Good luck in November, Dan.

SCIENCE CALENDAR: CENTER NURSES STRANDED SEA MAMMALS TO HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In spring, recently weaned elephant seal pups, which have been unable to learn 
to forage for themselves or are sick or injured, may start appearing in larger 
numbers on local beaches. The weakened seals are often taken by animal control 
agencies to the Marine Mammal Care Center at Ft. MacArthur in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is the official National Marine Fisheries receiving site for 
stranded seals and sea lions. The mostly volunteer staff takes in the animals, 
nurses them back to health and returns them to the wild. Visitors to the center 
can observe the workers as they examine the pups, feed and prepare them for 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 The elephant seal pups, which normally weigh between 125 and 150 pounds, can 
weigh as little as 70 to 80 pounds when they are brought to the center. 
Although most of the animals at the facility are juveniles, volunteers also 
help rehabilitate adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which is a kind of M.A.S.H. unit for marine mammals, currently has 
about 10 to 15 Northern elephant seal pups, 10 to 15 California sea lion pups 
and five to six harbor seal juveniles on hand.  
</P>
<P>
 The center is open to the public seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call 
(310) 548-5677. 
</P>
<P>

AL MARTINEZ: KING OF THE CON MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If it is true that Joseph Seide is really dead, then it is fitting that he 
should have died on Friday the 13th. Joe always had a flair for the unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 I am aware that his wife, Mandy, says he is dead, and that his best friend and 
benefactor, bail bondsman Joey Barnum, says he is dead, but I am still not 
convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Seide had been hustling me for years to write a column about him or one of 
his clients, but except for Barnum, I had resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, however, a man of many cons, and it would not surprise me to learn 
after this appears in the paper that he had faked his own death in order to get 
his way. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not alone in assuming this is possible. Mandy told me that two of Joe's 
friends who are old-time comics came by their Westside apartment a day after 
Joe had allegedly passed away. 
</P>
<P>
 Told he had died, they laughed and said sure he has, what's the old bastard up 
to now? Then they searched the apartment. Only when they didn't find him, and 
after listening to Mandy, did they become convinced he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 But I remain skeptical and am hedging my bet until after they cremate him and 
scatter his ashes over Hollywood or some other appropriate locale. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe was never to be taken at face value. A judge who sentenced him to federal 
prison for tax evasion in 1980 called him the world's greatest con man, a title 
Joe carried with pride until the day he is said to have died. 
</P>
<P>
 It stemmed from his effort to corner the sugar market which, like a lot of his 
deals, didn't quite make it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I never knew when Joe was telling the truth and when he was lying for the sake 
of his own image. He was, and perhaps still is, a big, bombastic man with a 
bellow like the mating cry of an elk, and he'd shout down anyone who challenged 
his veracity. 
</P>
<P>
 He told me he had once worked for the old L.A. Herald, which is impossible to 
check since the Herald no longer exists. He also told me he was the personal 
manager and press agent for Janis Joplin, Susan Hayward and Lee Marvin, which 
is also unverifiable since they too are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The story goes that Joe got into show biz in the first place when he was hired 
to keep actor Broderick Crawford sober when Crawford was the star of a 
television series. They fired Joe when they learned that instead of helping 
Crawford he had become his drinking partner. 
</P>
<P>
 This too, by the way, is impossible to check, since Crawford is also dead. 
</P>
<P>
 What I know for sure about Joe is that he spent three years at Terminal Island 
and that, while there, he worked with the FBI to expose corruption in the 
prison administration. As Joe put it at the time, "They're bigger crooks than I 
am." It won him an early release. 
</P>
<P>
 I also know that while in prison he met Mandy, who had come to visit a friend, 
and who fell in love with him possibly for the same reasons everyone sort of 
liked Joe even when they were being conned. Joe could laugh at himself, and 
that is a rare quality among men. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was released from the slammer, Joe pursued Mandy, who was working in 
a Fresno tomato cannery, and wooed her with the same kind of fervor he applied 
in trying to corner the sugar market, only this time it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, sensing the possibilities, he tried to sell their story as a movie of 
the week. He was still trying when he is said to have died. With Joe, nothing 
was ever wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe owed money all over town, much of it to Joey Barnum. "Two weeks after I 
bailed him out of prison he borrowed a thousand dollars and I've been giving 
him money ever since," Barnum says. He estimates the tab at about $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe was charging Barnum for trying to sell Barnum's story as a television 
series. It is ironic that, after Joe's alleged death, his efforts may be 
finally bearing fruit. A studio is interested in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone ought to tell Joe about it before they cremate him. If he is dead, 
that would spur him back to life. "One more deal," he would shout with 
characteristic bombast, "just one more!" 
</P>
<P>
 The last time he contacted me he was selling $100 tickets to raffle off a 
six-unit apartment building. He wasn't even sure it was legal, but had the 
tickets printed just the same. He wanted a column on it. I passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lived by his wits," Mandy said, "but even those he conned loved him." Joe 
was 61 and suffered from a heart condition. Mandy found him on the morning of 
Friday the 13th. He was either not breathing or simply holding his breath for 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, his wit lingers on. Going through his stuff, Mandy found a note 
that said, "If I die first, have Joey Barnum pay for my funeral." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnum laughed and said he would . . . assuming, of course, that big, loud, 
lovable Joseph Seide is actually, irrevocably dead.

CLINTON ALLEGATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Dershowitz's commentary "Where Are the Anita Hill Feminists Now?" (May 9) 
scores a direct hit. Clearly the political orientation of the accused plays a 
pivotal role in the minds of both accusers and supporters. From the feminists' 
point of view, conservatives must be destroyed at all cost while liberals and 
socialists must be protected from any sort of embarrassing exposure. Feminists 
appear not to consider this hypocrisy. On the contrary, to the true believer it 
is simply a matter of "the ends justify the means" when it comes to protecting 
the politically correct. 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLES IVIE 
</P>
<P>
 Victorville 
</P>
<P>
 Dershowitz, in accusing feminist supporters of President Bill Clinton of 
hypocrisy and inconsistency, couldn't be more wrong. He is wrong on his facts, 
he's wrong on his analysis and he's wrong in his conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 First, one need not be a feminist to expect and desire that the laws 
prohibiting sexual harassment be fully enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, those of us who have struggled and advocated for effective remedies 
for sexual harassment have done so consistently whether the complaint was made 
by Prof. Anita Hill, Lt. Paula Coughlin or Paula Corbin Jones. The issue then 
and the issue now is that the allegations receive a full and fair hearing. The 
outcry and the outrage that followed Hill's allegations were caused when the 
U.S. Senate refused to take her allegations seriously and threatened to sweep 
them under the rug. Then, when it did finally decide to air those allegations, 
it did so in a politically charged environment instead of an impartial hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Feminists (and others) are not now engaged in the same outcry because it is 
not necessary. In fact to do so would be inconsistent and hypocritical. Neither 
the White House nor President Clinton has ignored or avoided these allegations. 
Instead, the President responded immediately, by hiring an attorney to 
represent him in this matter, surely an indication that he takes this 
seriously. These allegations will be heard under the procedures for 
adjudicating civil rights matters -- procedures that seek to resolve 
differences in an impartial manner using rules of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The only hypocrisy we can find in this matter is that of the organizations and 
individuals who denounced the sexual harassment allegations of Hill as the 
hysterical imaginings of a bitter woman, and now are clamoring about the 
"injustice" done to Jones.

 The feminists who holler "women don't lie" have been thunderously silent in 
their nonsupport of Jones' suit against Clinton. Despite the fact that Hill has 
made a career and a fortune based solely on her accusations, Clinton's 
apologists and the feminists are slamming Jones as an opportunist even though 
she is a more typical victim than Hill -- a $6.35-per-hour clerical worker 
rather than a Yale-graduate career lawyer at the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission. Once again, not only people, but principles are sacrificed for the 
sake of partisan politics.

 Jones is another drop of water from the Republican smear campaign against 
Clinton. Now that Whitewater is petering out, the campaign managers have been 
forced to return to dirty sex for lack of anything better. The first 
disclosures are that something went on in a hotel room that is too gross to be 
spoken of in public. Then will come the disclosures bit by bit. I find the 
whole procedure disgusting. And, I will bet, nothing will ever be disclosed 
that indicates the President is incapable of discharging his responsibilities. 
In the meantime, of course, his effectiveness is compromised, which is the goal 
of those hostile to what he is doing for us.

 We have but to look back at 12 years and more of Republican disasters: 
Watergate, Iran-Contra, and the financing of Iraq prior to the Persian Gulf 
War. These present issues against President Clinton and First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton are not about "character," stupid. In fact, these innuendoes are 
political aims at the presidency and his successes since taking office. 
Republicans are attempting to divert the focus away from the real problems 
which face our nation and the world today.

PLASTIC SURGEONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was with a great deal of pride that I read of the extraordinary feat of 
microvascular surgery performed by two of my colleagues, Drs. John Gross and 
Bala Chandrasekhar, in "Ghastly Accident Tests Skill of Doctors, Victim's 
Pluck" (May 6). 
</P>
<P>
 As a president of the 400-plus-member California Society of Plastic Surgeons 
Inc. (CSPS), a medical society of physicians who are board certified in plastic 
surgery, I would have welcomed the designation of both doctors as plastic 
surgeons rather than simply doctors or surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
 No other recognized specialty requires more surgical training in 
reconstructive and cosmetic surgery prior to qualification to practice than 
plastic surgery. To be eligible for board certification by the American Board 
of Plastic Surgery, we must have had between five and seven years of training 
after medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful completion of rigorous written and oral examinations by a board 
of distinguished examiners on a wide range of subjects in the field of 
aesthetic and reconstructive plastic surgery is necessary, as is moral and 
ethical standing satisfactory to the board.

LAUDABLE MOVE BY RU-486 MAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long years of effort by abortion rights groups appear to have paid off Monday 
when the European manufacturer of RU-486 announced that it has donated the U.S. 
patent rights for the abortion pill to the not-for-profit Population Council. 
That opens the door for widespread use of this valuable but controversial drug 
in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 This is good news. And coming just days after the Senate gave final 
congressional approval to a bill that makes it a federal crime to blockade 
abortion clinics or to harass clinic staffs or patients, it signals a sea 
change in abortion politics.  
</P>
<P>
 The constitutional right of women to terminate a pregnancy generally has been 
protected in recent decades. But the ability of women to exercise that right 
has been substantially eroded through violence at clinics, gag rules on 
abortion counseling and restrictions on public funding. Anti-abortion activists 
had long threatened to boycott other Roussel Uclaf products if the company 
supplied the drug for testing in the United States. But with the donation of 
the patent rights, the New York-based Population Council can begin clinical 
trials in the fall. Studies abroad have found it cheaper than and as effective 
as a surgical abortion. Formal approval by the Food and Drug Administration to 
market the drug in the United States could come six months after the federal 
agency receives an application from an interested manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who decide to have an abortion should not be blocked from exercising 
that legal right, and in the next few years RU-486 could provide an important 
non-surgical alternative.

MAY 17 -- SPECIAL DAY IN HISTORY; COURT'S PROHIBITION OF SCHOOL SEGREGATION 
CHANGED AMERICA'S FACE FOREVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty years ago today, the U.S. Supreme Court changed America. On May 17, 
1954, Chief Justice Earl Warren, one of the giants of the court, announced the 
landmark decision, Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka. That historic ruling 
outlawed legal segregation in the public schools and extended the promise of 
the Constitution to all Americans regardless of race. 
</P>
<P>
 Persuaded by the brilliance of a team of attorneys led by Thurgood Marshall, a 
unanimous court struck down the so-called "separate-but-equal" dual system of 
segregated schools as unconstitutional. The justices directed school systems to 
act with "all deliberate speed" in implementing change. But in most places, 
school integration was postponed for years. A few districts simply closed their 
public schools rather than integrate. 
</P>
<P>
 The separate and generally inferior education reserved for black children 
continued despite the ruling; local governments typically spent much more to 
educate white children than was spent to instruct black children. In many 
school districts, black youngsters walked miles past white schools to reach 
dilapidated buildings and outdated books handed down from white students. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the inequity was the most severe in the South, it was bad in the North, 
too. Achieving integration required court orders, federal soldiers, courageous 
children and still braver parents, who lost farms, jobs and homes because they 
dared to challenge an immoral status quo. The victories were legion, but the 
battles still are not over.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, two out of three black children attend schools with predominantly 
nonwhite enrollments, according to a report from the National School Boards 
Assn. Latino children are even more likely to attended segregated schools, 
particularly in the West, including California. This new segregation forces 
some to ask whether Brown failed. Absolutely not. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of Brown is measured by the dramatic increase of the black 
professional and middle class. The positive political legacy is quantified 
dramatically by a count of black elected officials and judges. 
</P>
<P>
 May 17, 1954, indelibly changed U.S. race relations. The profound agreement of 
all fair-minded Americans, whether white or of color, with the simple justice 
of the Brown decision is lasting proof of its greatest achievement.

BICYCLE SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While it is good to learn that the California Highway Patrol is concerned 
about bicyclist safety (May 1), why does CHP place the responsibility for 
safety on bicyclists? Aren't they aware that almost all bicyclists seriously 
injured or killed were hit by cars? 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't the CHP bear some responsibility for preventing these collisions? The 
CHP should work toward deterring dangerous motorist behavior, which would 
benefit everyone: cyclists, pedestrians, motorcyclists and other motorists.

WORK AROUND JAPAN'S REVOLVING PRIME-MINISTER DOOR; POLICY: THE U.S. SHOULD FORM 
A COHESIVE STAND AND STICK TO IT, RATHER THAN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EACH NEW 
GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IVAN P. HALL, Ivan P. Hall, a Japan historian, was until recently a 
professor in the political science department at Gakushuin University, Tokyo. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ultra right-wing campaign truck passes my home here: Rising Sun flags 
fluttering from the roof, "For an Independent Constitution" painted across its 
doors. Loudspeakers blare out support for just-resigned Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano's provocative May 3 assertion that Japan's invasion of Asia was 
a war of liberation, not aggression, and the Nanjing massacre "a fabrication."  
</P>
<P>
 This dissent from apologies to Asia from former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and Emperor Akihito was ideological par for the new government of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and his backstage fixer Ichiro Ozawa, arguably the 
most nationalistic, right-leaning cabinet since World War II. Too many 
Americans, grasping for straws of hope, see Ozawa as the "can do" man who will 
put the politicians in charge of a recalcitrant bureaucracy and lead Japan to 
greater democracy, deregulation, open markets and "internationalization." This 
is a serious misperception, compounded by the Clinton Administration's decision 
to go easy on trade lest the new government (for which most Japanese see a life 
span of one to two months) collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The tumult at Japan's prime minister level strikes some foreign observers as a 
Gilbert and Sullivan farce, inexplicable for a nation normally so purposeful 
and "together." It is neither. Japan's long-term direction in the postwar 
period has always been laid down by the political arm, then left (too broadly, 
to be sure) to the permanent bureaucracy for implementation. After nearly a 
half-century of stability, political structures and ideologies are in 
long-delayed flux. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida placed Japan firmly on the track 
of a low military profile, close ties with the United States, acceptance of the 
new democratic constitution and concentration on the economic miracle those 
commitments made possible. Although the right wing of the ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party would have preferred to turn the clock back, the mainstream 
conservatives have adhered to that formula, with the large socialist opposition 
also blocking any return to political and military chauvinism. With the LDP 
finally out of power after too many money-tainted scandals, that old political 
configuration collapsed. Meanwhile, with no Cold War rationale for following 
the U.S. lead, foreign complaints about unfettered trade expansion and the lure 
of a prospering Asia, Japan now seeks a new definition of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 To many Japanese, Hata's "reformist" New Life Party and its prime mover, 
Ozawa, look too much like the old politics of veiled intentions, Byzantine 
coups and rough riding over democratic process. Voters were upset by Ozawa's 
sudden and secretive launching of a new parliamentary group excluding the 
coalition's largest partner, the Social Democratic Party. Having made painful 
policy concessions to get Hata elected, the Socialists withdrew, leaving Hata 
with a minority cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 The rump alliance now combines the political nationalism of Hata's Shinseito 
(dominated by former LDP right-wingers like Nagano) and the religious 
nationalism of the Buddhist-affiliated Komeito (Clean Government Party). 
Ozawa's strategy is to lure additional LDP hawks to his fold, decimate the 
Socialist and smaller opposition parties through the "reformed" single-seat 
election district system and create two sibling conservative parties on the 
prewar model. The strategy's basic goals include an expanded military role, a 
revision of the postwar constitution (shamefully "imposed" by the United 
States) and a more aggressive leadership of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been talk of rallying a more liberal-minded and less chauvinistic 
alternative alliance of the LDP left (cleansed of tainted money) and Socialist 
Democrats' right (purged of Marxist hard-liners). A tall order -- but a truer 
two-party system than Ozawa's, and one that could hold Japan to its postwar 
democratic heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 In their eagerness to see Japan's bureaucrats humbled, Americans should also 
mind who does the humbling. Actually, differences on trade issues between 
bureaucrats, politicians and the public are not nearly as wide as some 
Americans would hope. Japanese people still think of themselves more as 
job-holders, producers and loyal company workers than as individual consumers, 
and are grateful for protection, whatever leadership may supply it. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States should simply develop a visibly coordinated, persuasively 
argued and consistently applied Japan policy and stick with it. Nothing would 
better concentrate the mind of this, or any other new Japanese administration. 
If we don't, America may have invented Tokyo's best gambit yet for fending off 
market-opening pressures: just keep changing prime ministers. A punishment 
fitting the crime.

PERSPECTIVE ON DESEGREGATION; REMEMBERING A KANSAS CHILDHOOD; REGISTERING 
VOTERS, WORKING IN THE LEGISLATURE -- AND NOT GETTING INVITED TO SLUMBER 
PARTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON WOODSON-BRYANT, Sharon Woodson-Bryant is local government affairs 
manager with the Gas Co. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I grew up in Topeka, Kan., an unobtrusive, Midwestern town with a modest 
African American population of about 18,000. But 40 years ago today, the people 
I knew, the ones I saw with my parents, in our neighborhood or at church made 
history, with Brown vs. the Topeka Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 As a first-grader at Buchanan Elementary School, I had no idea of the 
significance of this Supreme Court decision in 1954. But two years later, when 
schools were forced to desegregate, it made a dramatic change in my life. Like 
an uninvited guest, it came with a crash when my new schoolmates asked me 
suspiciously why was I so tan. I soon learned the duality of integration during 
those early years. 
</P>
<P>
 My teacher was from western Kansas and like many of her students, had never 
met an African American. There begins a series of bittersweet contradictions. 
No matter how well or poorly I did, I always got a B. She would later explain 
to my mother that she didn't know how to judge me in relationship to the white 
students. This tentativeness seeped into other relationships. Regardless of how 
much my white girlfriends seemed to like me, they could never invite me to 
their slumber parties. Yet whenever there was a special event or program, there 
was Sharon, a symbol of both tokenism and triumph.  
</P>
<P>
 Remembering those years, I now realize that I had some tremendous 
opportunities to balance the attacks on my self-esteem. Most memorable was 
meeting Dr. Carl Menninger, founder of the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, and 
being part of a pilot program with some of my white schoolmates. Maybe through 
osmosis, time with renowned psychiatrists helped give me coping skills. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents probably understood more than I realized about what I was going 
through, because they arranged for me to regularly spend time with my black 
friends. Both my mother and father kept me involved with organizations that are 
traditionally part of the African American infrastructure. I learned 
parliamentary procedures from Jack and Jill, social graces as a Bob-o-Link and 
spiritual lessons from St. John AME. 
</P>
<P>
 But the impression that has lasted throughout my life was seeing my parents' 
commitment to the civil-rights struggle. I remember going with them to the 
black sections of Topeka, soliciting NAACP memberships and registering voters. 
I felt the bond of our African American community during those years of 
struggling for school desegregation. When I saw Oliver Brown at church, I was 
told that he was someone important, and so was his daughter Linda. But since 
she was several years older, I never knew her very well, and certainly didn't 
realize they were the plaintiffs in a Supreme Court case. 
</P>
<P>
 Since my father was a lawyer, I grew up knowing the other local attorneys 
involved in the lawsuit and was raised in a household committed to civil 
rights, black businesses and the Republican Party. In junior high school, I was 
a page for the Kansas Legislature and babysat for the children of Alex Haley's 
brother George, a state representative from Kansas City who had brought his 
youngsters to one of the sessions. Because Kansas was traditionally a one-party 
state, I knew only one black Democrat until I was in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Another anchor was Art Fletcher, the former chair of the U.S. Commission on 
Civil Rights, who was at Washburn University with my father. While in Los 
Angeles last year for hearings on the riots, he told me some incredible stories 
of what he and this group of young lawyers accomplished as Black Republicans in 
Kansas. He and my father organized a statewide black voting bloc that 
eventually created the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Being grounded in a tradition of black pride helped balance some of the fear 
and anger I had to internalize in Topeka. I still carry vivid memories from 
when I was 5 and my mother was told that she and I couldn't eat at the counter 
of the Woolworth's downtown. When I was in junior high school, I remember when 
police dogs attacked our small group of youngsters leaving a Jack and Jill 
party, just because we were black.  
</P>
<P>
 These contradictions helped shaped my vision of who I was and what was going 
to be important to me. By 13, I knew I was going to be a journalist and change 
the world, because I had witnessed how my small African American community had 
made an unparalleled contribution to American history. And the anger from my 
early experiences with racism focused those dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, my first year as the education reporter for the Ann Arbor News in 
Michigan, my father become the first black to serve on the Topeka Board of 
Education. Topeka wasn't all jeweled slippers and yellow-brick roads, but it 
was home and a source of African American pride for me.

ANGELS, STANDING PAT, LOSE TO WHITE SOX, 8-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They met Monday afternoon and debated the ramifications of rising earned-run 
averages, lowered standards and the possibility of replacing one of their 
struggling starters. 
</P>
<P>
 They decided the best course of action was no action. It seems Angel Manager 
Buck Rodgers, General Manager Bill Bavasi and assistant GM Tim Mead can't get 
anyone out, either. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for the time being at least, the Angel rotation remains the same. 
</P>
<P>
 That was good news for the Chicago White Sox, who pounded five Angel pitchers, 
including starter Phil Leftwich, for 12 hits en route to an 8-5 victory in 
front of 21,387 at Anaheim Stadium on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have scored 40 runs in the last five games and won twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's either trying to pitch too fine or they don't have control, but 
it seems like we're always behind (in the count) 2-0 or 3-1," Rodgers said. "I 
can't believe their control is that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 In this time of reduced expectations, Leftwich produced what might be 
considered a quality start by the Angels, giving up three earned runs in 5 1/3 
innings. In the last two games, Joe Magrane and Leftwich pitched a combined 9 
2/3 innings . . . . and threw 239 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox countered with Scott Sanderson, who jumped out to a 7-2 start 
with a 2.82 earned-run average for the Angels last year, then lost nine of his 
next 11 starts and was released in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox signed him as a free agent in February and the 37-year-old 
right-hander has been doing exactly what Rodgers wishes he could persuade most 
of his beleaguered pitchers to do: be aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 In 30 1/3 innings this season, Sanderson has walked two batters and struck out 
16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scotty will go at you," Rodgers said. "He isn't afraid to pitch inside. He's 
a gamer." 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich, on the other hand, was almost a goner a week ago. On the brink of 
losing his spot in the rotation, he got a reprieve when Brian Anderson broke 
his thumb while trying to field a ground ball bare-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich responded by giving up just one run in his last start, but he wasn't 
quite as sharp Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out getting ahead of the majority of the guys and I felt real 
strong," Leftwich said. "But I was trying not to let their RBI-guys hurt me and 
I started pitching around them a little bit instead of making quality pitches 
early in the count." 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Ventura gave Chicago a 1-0 lead when he slammed his ninth homer of the 
season leading off the second and the White Sox got two more in the third when 
Tim Raines singled, Joey Cora walked and both scored on Julio Franco's double 
to left, which was misplayed by Dwight Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith got back the run he gave away in the bottom of the third, however, 
hitting his first homer in Anaheim Stadium. One out later, Chad Curtis evened 
the score, 3-3, with an opposite-field rocket to right-center that could be 
considered more evidence for juiced-ball theorists. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox regained the lead in the fifth and Rodgers probably went through 
a roll of antacids. 
</P>
<P>
 Raines and Cora singled with one out and Leftwich walked Frank Thomas to load 
the bases. Franco lined out to center to score Raines, but when Leftwich walked 
Ventura to reload the bases, Rodgers stomped to the mound and delivered an 
animated throw-a-strike lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told him to stop beating himself and to make them beat him," Rodgers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels went ahead, 5-4, in the sixth when Bo Jackson, in his first 
three-hit game of the season, led off with a single and eventually scored on 
Jorge Fabregas' single to center. Fabregas stole second and scored on Harold 
Reynolds' double to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 That was it for Sanderson, who failed to improve to 4-0 at his former 
teammates' expense, but it wasn't the end of the Angel pitchers' misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Cora and Thomas opened the seventh with back-to-back singles off Mike Butcher 
and scored when Curtis let Franco's single to center get past him, Franco 
reaching third. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to get very good defense when your infielders and 
outfielders have to get set and then back off for a 100-some pitches in the 
first five innings," Rodgers said. "We thought we had gotten over the hump 
there when we got the lead in the sixth. We were heading into the home stretch 
with a lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "That takes a little starch out of you."

 They are in sole possession of first place in the National League West for the 
first time since Oct. 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 They got there Monday night at Mile High Stadium, defeating the Colorado 
Rockies, 9-2, a victory that began with Mike Piazza's two-run shot to left -- 
yes, left field -- and was enhanced by a three-run homer by Tim Wallach, all 
contributing to the Dodgers' seventh consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach had four runs batted in -- his last a single in the sixth inning that 
scored Delino DeShields -- and now has 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know it was my 1,000th until somebody told me," said Wallach, 
who is batting .310 with 33 RBIs. "If I would have set one goal, I would have 
set 1,000 RBIs. It's nice." 
</P>

 It took winning nine of their last 11 games and a loss by the San Francisco 
Giants Mondaynight for the Dodgers to regain a position they haven't been in 
for more than two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Has it been that long?" asked Manager Tom Lasorda, whose team stranded a 
season-high 13 runners. "We had 17 hits tonight -- they stung the ball well. 
This is a great group of guys. What they lack in ability they make up for in 
desire and the will to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger clubhouse after the game was the liveliest it has been in well, 
about two years, with Piazza and Wallach holding court for reporters, a scene 
that has become common. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geez, have an off-day," Cory Snyder yelled to Wallach in jest. 
</P>
<P>
 Their hitting prowess didn't escape Colorado starter Greg Harris (2-2), who 
gave up six runs and 10 hits before he was relieved in the fifth inning by Kent 
Bottenfield. "With Wallach swinging the bat so well, there's no spot where you 
can look up and take a breath," Harris said.  
</P>
<P>
 Seven of Piazza's homers this season have been between center and right field 
-- two to center, three to right and two to right center. But Piazza's eighth, 
a two-run shot of 402 feet in the first inning, went deep into the left-field 
seats, putting the Dodgers ahead, 2-0. "I can't explain that -- every now and 
then I'll hit (on) the barrel (of the bat)," said Piazza, who is batting .316 
with a team-leading 34 RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
 "This team isn't making too many mistakes, we aren't giving too many runs 
away. Here, Harris walks me intentionally (in the fifth) and Tim hits the home 
run. You have to be strong one through nine to be successful. You can't rely on 
one guy to carry the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza, who had three RBIs, also singled and doubled, the latter drive 
traveling about 400 feet to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 But the direction of the home run was the biggest surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I learned to hit the opposite way in high school, because the only 
fence was in right field," Piazza said. "If I didn't hit it over that fence, 
then I had to run. With my speed, I didn't get a lot of inside-the-park home 
runs. It's either that, or I'm just swinging late at everything.  
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, I just let the pitch get in. I'm staying back and my hands 
are back, and I guess I have more of a natural inside-out swing. I'll hit some 
balls to left, but I think of my (35) homers last season, only two or three 
went to left." 
</P>
<P>
 While Piazza went to left, Wallach went as far right as possible, hitting his 
three-run homer in the fifth inning barely inside the foul pole, his 11th homer 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I ever hit one out here in right field when I played here (in 
the minors)," Wallach said.  
</P>
<P>
 " '87 was probably the last time I have been in (such a good groove), but it's 
been so long, I can't remember." 
</P>
<P>
 The story has been written often lately of how Reggie Smith, the Dodger 
hitting instructor, has helped restore Wallach's swing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith corrects those who say Wallach's swing is back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to get back to where he was, but where he is supposed to 
be," Smith said. "At this point in Tim's career, he should be in his prime. A 
player's peak years are between the ages of 29 and 34, so Tim (at 36) should 
still be at the top of his game. He's a different person now, so his swing will 
differ also. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we looked at films (when he was swinging well), we did it merely to give 
him a reference point, not to take him back there." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite giving up five walks, Ramon Martinez (2-2) held the Rockies to one run 
before Walt Weiss led off the seventh inning with a triple. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez then left because of a stiff lower back, which trainers say appears 
to be OK, and was replaced by Jim Gott, whose wild pitch scored Weiss.

JAZZ WILL TRY TO PUT AWAY THE NUGGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Utah Jazz are not a happy bunch. Denied a sweep in Denver, the Jazz intend 
to put this Western Conference semifinal to rest once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're upset we didn't win that game," Jazz guard Jeff Hornacek said after 
practice Monday. "We wanted to get back to Utah and play immediately. That was 
the guys' attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Hornacek said it was an angry Utah team that flew back to Salt Lake City on 
Sunday night after losing 83-82 to the Nuggets. The Jazz, who lead the 
best-of-7 series 3-1, will try again tonight to wrap things up. 
</P>
<P>
 No team in NBA history has come back from a 3-0 deficit to win a playoff 
series. Still, Sunday's victory -- coming off a 111-109 overtime loss the day 
before -- gave Denver a glimmer of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Game 4 we said 'No, we won't go home like this,"' Nuggets center Dikembe 
Mutombo said. "We might sneak in another one and go back to Mile High City." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Nuggets are used to overcoming the odds. Their first-round victory 
over Seattle was the first time an eighth-seeded team beat a No.1 seed since 
the league went to a 16-team postseason format 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Another parallel: Denver was on the verge of elimination against the 
SuperSonics, too, but won three straight to overcome a 2-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a do-or-die situation for us and we are still down," said LaPhonso 
Ellis, who scored 17 points in Game 4. "We're not dead yet. It will be tough in 
Utah, but we're still alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hornacek, who had 12 points Sunday, does not intend to let history repeat 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won one game, but we're coming home with a 3-1 lead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Karl Malone, perhaps sobered by his miserable 6-for-20 shooting and 
sub-par 20 points in Game 4, is more circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the end of the world; we're still up 3-1," he said. "But we're not 
going to then have to say, 'we're still up 3-2' then be tied, either." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets have lost 17 of their last 18 games in Utah, including four this 
season.

INDIANAPOLIS 500 DAILY REPORT; POSITIONS OF GROFF, RAHAL IN JEOPARDY AS MORE 
THAN 20 SEEK TO JOIN FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With only three positions left to be filled in the 33-car 500 field, and 20 or 
more driver-car combinations on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway grounds, 
prospects are good for a wild final qualifying weekend. Bumping will start as 
soon as there are 33 qualifiers. This will make Honda drivers Mike Groff and 
Bobby Rahal most vulnerable. A number of drivers have already called off 
attempts with speeds higher than Groff's 218.808 or Rahal's 220.178. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those still seeking spots in the field are four-time winner Al Unser, 
former pole sitter Pancho Carter, former rookies of the year Fabrizio Barbazza 
and Jeff Andretti, and Gary Bettenhausen, Geoff Brabham, John Paul Jr., Scott 
Goodyear, Willy T. Ribbs, Buddy Lazier, Johnny Parsons, Scott Pruett, Didier 
Theys and Jim Crawford -- all veterans of past 500s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After going from Indiana to California and back twice in four days, John 
Andretti finished 19th in the Save Mart 300 stock car race last Sunday at Sears 
Point Raceway near Sonoma. It was Andretti's best finish in 10 Winston Cup 
races this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, he had qualified on the outside of the front row for the Indy 500 
-- after having been at Sears Point to qualify on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a piece of cake compared to what I used to do," he said. "I used to 
race 60 to 80 races a year and go to Moravian College on the East Coast 
(Bethlehem, Pa.) and drive back and forth (to Indianapolis) every weekend, and 
that's a 1,500-mile round trip. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Two-time Indy winner Rodger Ward was hospitalized after suffering a heart 
attack Saturday in Ely, Nev., but was released Monday and expects to be at the 
Speedway next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most teams took the day off Monday after finishing the first weekend of time 
trials. Only 18 cars were on the track. Busiest was Emerson Fittipaldi, who ran 
86 laps in one of Roger Penske's backup cars. He was also fastest with a 
226.421-m.p.h. lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Fastest of the non-qualified drivers was rookie Mark Smith, at 219.411, in 
Derrick Walker's Lola-Ford Cosworth. SHAV GLICK

 Jay Leno has been making fun of the New York Mets in his monologue for the 
last two years. Sunday, the Mets got even, as Leno went along with an old prank 
normally reserved for rookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno, taping the "Tonight Show" in New York, visited the Mets' Shea Stadium 
clubhouse before their game with the Atlanta Braves and was asked to 
participate in the "three-man lift." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some kind of scam going on here, but all right," Leno said. 
</P>
<P>
 The scam resulted in the Mets dousing Leno with cups of soda, shaving cream, 
water, shampoo and other assorted liquids.

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; BRODEUR, DEVILS BRUSH OFF RANGERS' REGULAR-SEASON 
SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As center Bernie Nicholls of the New Jersey Devils said last week, the road to 
the Stanley Cup goes through New York.  
</P>
<P>
 But will the Rangers fall into a pothole before they reach the Lincoln Tunnel? 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to beat the best to accomplish what you set out to do," Nicholls 
said. "They're the best, and it wouldn't be right (to win the Cup) if we didn't 
beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Devils beat them dramatically Sunday night at Madison Square Garden, 
serving notice that the Rangers won't have a walkover in their Eastern 
Conference final series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers were the overwhelming favorites after sweeping the Islanders and 
subduing the Washington Capitals in five games. They were 6-0 against the 
Devils during the season and had humbled rookie goalie Martin Brodeur, who 
failed to finish his four starts against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are looking at that 0-6 and making decisions off that, but 
they shouldn't," said Devil defenseman Scott Stevens, a Norris Trophy finalist. 
"We're the underdogs, but I like it that way. I think it'll spark us. I think 
we're a better team because of what we had to go through in the first two 
rounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The Devils, who needed seven games to eliminate the Buffalo Sabres and six to 
beat the Boston Bruins, were better than the Rangers in Sunday's 4-3 
double-overtime victory. Their defense, which is more physical than the 
Rangers', held up solidly. And Brodeur finished what he started this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Devils have won four consecutive road games, which is crucial now. Even 
when they are home, their fans are outnumbered by the Ranger faithful, so they 
will feel as if they are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will likely be more people in the area who hate us if we win, but 
that's OK," winger John MacLean said. "We're looking forward to knocking them 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Will they? We still say Rangers in seven, but every game will be tight. 
CANUCKS CRUISING 
</P>
<P>
 As have the Devils, who are in the semifinals for the first time since 1988, 
the Vancouver Canucks have taken a long break between semifinal appearances. It 
has been 12 years since they beat Chicago for the conference title and went on 
to the finals, in which they lost to the Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Their success this spring is surprising. They were pessimistic before the 
playoffs began and figured that the Calgary Flames, who dwarfed them 
physically, would dominate them. They also doubted their goaltending would hold 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 So they outlasted Calgary in seven bruising games and disposed of the Dallas 
Stars in a swift five, thanks in part to goalie Kirk McLean's brilliant play. 
</P>
<P>
 This can be interpreted as a reminder that the regular season means almost 
nothing or as a tribute to Pat Quinn's talents. Credit Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
 As general manager, he acquired Jeff Brown and Bret Hedican to add an 
offensive dimension to the defense. As coach, he squeezed good performances out 
of defensemen Dave Babych and Gerald Diduck, got five goals out of the line of 
Cliff Ronning, Sergio Momesso and Martin Gelinas in the first round, and is 
smart enough to stay out of the way while Trevor Linden plays the best hockey 
of his career. Linden scored his ninth playoff goal in the Canucks' 3-2 
overtime loss to Toronto on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Linden, moved from right wing to center with Greg Adams on the left and Pavel 
Bure on the right, sparked Bure's hot streak. The Russian winger had six goals 
against Dallas and has nine overall, tying him with Linden for the postseason 
lead. SHARKS LOSE THEIR BITE 
</P>
<P>
 The San Jose Sharks made a great run, but they lacked the depth and muscle to 
beat the Maple Leafs. They couldn't stop Wendel Clark, who took control of the 
series by leveling some crunching checks and scoring four goals in the last two 
games. Doug Gilmour, despite a bad ankle, found ways to win, and goalie Felix 
Potvin, seasoned by last spring's semifinal trip, was solid. Potvin outplayed 
Arturs Irbe, who gave up some soft goals. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose lost the series in Game 6, when it squandered several good chances 
before Toronto's Mike Gartner won it in overtime. Give the Sharks' power play 
an over-passing grade. They should have passed less and shot more. Sandis 
Ozolinsh, who had 26 regular-season goals, had none in the playoffs because he 
wouldn't -- or couldn't -- shoot. San Jose scored prettier goals, but Toronto 
won by throwing the puck at the net and pursuing rebounds, the smart way to go 
in tight-checking playoff games. And the Maple Leafs' forechecking pressured 
the Sharks into countless turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Sergei Makarov and Igor Larionov, the Sharks are a young team, and 
this experience will help them in future playoffs. That also applies to Coach 
Kevin Constantine, who made an outstanding debut. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Maple Leafs and Canucks in the Western final, it's going to be a 
physical series, with Toronto clawing to the top in seven games. PHILADELPHIA 
STORY 
</P>
<P>
 Florida General Manager Bob Clarke's return to Philadelphia, once considered a 
sure bet, now appears unlikely. But it can't be ruled out because of Flyer 
owner Ed Snider's friendship with Clarke, dating to Clarke's playing days. 
</P>
<P>
 From the day Snider's son, Jay, resigned as the Flyers' president, Clarke was 
rumored to be headed north on I-95 to the Spectrum. Clarke wouldn't say 
anything then, but when asked recently, he told the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel 
he would remain with the Panthers and would make their pick at the June draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a contract. I have a job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers are reluctant to let him out of that contract -- believed to be 
for four years -- and reportedly were annoyed to hear he had talked to Snider. 
However, there is a possibility they would accept compensation to let him go. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the Flyers need Clarke is another matter. General Manager Russ Farwell 
has done a good job of drafting and trading, and Snider said Farwell's job is 
safe. Coach Terry Simpson, however, will probably be fired. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who have lost two playoff games, can still tie an NHL playoff 
record. Since 1980, when byes were eliminated and teams had to win four series 
to earn the Cup, the fewest games a team has lost is two, by the 1988 Edmonton 
Oilers. The last undefeated playoff team was the 1960 Montreal Canadiens, who 
swept the Blackhawks and Maple Leafs to win their fifth consecutive Cup. . . . 
The Stars don't plan any major retooling for next season, and they probably 
don't need much besides a left winger who can score. Had defenseman Mark 
Tinordi been able to play -- he has a broken leg -- they might have put up a 
stronger fight against Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Kasten of the NBA's Atlanta Hawks is using his friendship with NHL 
Commissioner Gary Bettman, formerly the NBA's third-in-command, to press for an 
NHL expansion franchise in Atlanta. . . . The Quebec Nordiques are projecting 
losses of $4.5 million (Canadian) for this season, $9 million next season and 
$11 million the following season. They want the Quebec government to help them 
financially, as it helped baseball's Montreal Expos three years ago with a 
low-interest, $18-million loan. . . . Boston's Adam Oates and Al Iafrate will 
need off-season surgery, Oates on a hand and Iafrate on a knee.

PREP GOLF; FULLERTON SUNNY HILLS UPSETS PALM DESERT TO WIN SECTION

<P>
 Fullerton Sunny Hills High surprised two-time defending champion Palm Desert 
and won the Southern Section team golf title Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 All signs had pointed to another Palm Desert victory. The Aztecs had spent the 
previous night in their homes before making the short drive to the familiar 
6,869-yard course at Canyon Country Club. Then they posted a score of 380, 17 
strokes better than their section-title winning score two years ago on this 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunny Hills matched the 380 and won a one-hole playoff by a stroke when 
sixth man Matt Sims made a one-foot putt for a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara San Marcos finished third with 388, Long Beach Millikan fourth 
with 391. Anaheim Esperanza with 393, Loyola with 395 and Huntington Beach with 
396 were the only other teams to break 400. The top four advanced to the 
CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. tournament on June 6 at Redlands Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Palm Desert players shot below 80, led by senior Jeremy Whiting, who had 
a two-under-par 70. That tied him with Torrance junior Ted Oh and San Marcos 
junior Mike Berg for low round of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills had four players under 80. Sophomore Terry Noe and freshman John 
Park each shot 72, freshman Jin Park 74 and Jenny Lee 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills put the pressure on immediately in the playoff. Park made a 
five-foot birdie putt on the 379-yard, par-four first hole, and Noe made par, 
putting the Lancers ahead by two. 
</P>
<P>
 Palm Desert got a stroke back in the second foursome when Bryan Geiberger, son 
of Senior PGA Tour player Al Geiberger, chipped in from the fringe for a 
birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim and Palm Desert's Nicole Dalkas each made par, and Palm Desert's Chris 
Meyerson made a bogey, leaving Sims about a foot away for his winning putt.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Let me be the first to suggest the following candidates to fill the latest 
Clipper coaching vacancy: 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna, who relates well to NBA players. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 George Raveling, who has a 50-7 record at the Sports Arena since March of 
1990. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Shue, who could prove that the third time around is the charm. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bertka, who had the best won-lost record of any L.A. pro basketball coach 
last season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Pfund, who had the second-best record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Walton, who knows every player's weaknesses. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Harper, who would keep the inmates in the Sports Arena prison in line. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn Buckner, who needs a new challenge. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Nolte, who is the only coach ever to get Shaquille O'Neal to win a big 
game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Tarkanian, who is eager to see if he can win with less talent than he 
had at Nevada Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Woods, who needs something to occupy his time on Clipper game nights. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Guokas, who is the designated former coach-future coach at NBC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Crystal, who is a good friend of Larry Brown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brown, who has been at Indiana far too long. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The lucky winner will be welcomed with open arms by owner Donald Sterling, who 
said of Bob Weiss in the 1993-94 Clipper media guide: "Our long-term commitment 
to him can only bring success." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Anyone who believes Chicago Bull Coach Phil Jackson should have suspended 
Scottie Pippen for the rest of the New York Knick series after Game 3 is way 
off the mark.Why penalize the rest of the team, which would have had no chance 
to beat the Knicks without Pippen, because of the stupidity of one player?. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 A rising star in the NBA is Denver Nugget forward LaPhonso Ellis, who is doing 
an outstanding job against Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The shortage of quality pitching is illustrated by the fact that three of the 
top five selections in last June's amateur draft are pitching in the major 
leagues. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 choice Darren Dreifort of Wichita State is with the Dodgers, No. 3 
choice Brian Anderson of Wright State with the Angels, and No. 5 choice Jeff 
Granger of Texas A&M with the Kansas City Royals. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Star of the 1992 draft class could turn out to be Paul Shuey, the Cleveland 
Indians' closer from the University of North Carolina who struck out four in an 
inning last week. . . . At the opposite extreme, there is also room now for 
older pitchers such as Goose Gossage, 42, of the Seattle Mariners. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As if Greater Gotham doesn't have enough teams in the hockey and basketball 
playoffs, the Yankees have swept five series and are 26-10 for the first time 
since 1958. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can play better than we are," former Angel outfielder Luis 
Polonia said after the Yankees' 10th consecutive victory. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 When Cal Ripken Jr. played in his 1,930th consecutive game Saturday, it put 
him 200 games away from Lou Gehrig's record. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Toronto General Manager Pat Gillick is going to have to make even better moves 
than usual to bring the Blue Jays into playoff contention. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Derek Stingley, son of paralyzed former wide receiver Darryl Stingley, is an 
outfielder in the Philadelphia Phillies' chain. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Another Brian Hunter will be in the majors soon. This one is a highly regarded 
outfielder playing for the Houston Astros' Tucson farm club in the Pacific 
Coast League. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The crazy thing is that George Foreman would have a chance against Michael 
Moorer and his brittle chin. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Foreman is also an actor, but HBO will not cast him in the lead role of its 
Mike Tyson movie. A heavyweight named Coley Wallace portrayed Joe Louis on the 
big screen. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'll have a rooting interest in the next golf tournament in which Paul Azinger 
plays. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A performance of the play "Coaches" Saturday night at the Freud Theatre at 
UCLA will benefit the California Special Olympics. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa Senator executive John Ferguson calls 18-year-old Russian defenseman 
Oleg Tverbvosky, who will be eligible for this year's draft, the next Bobby 
Orr. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One-word description of the New Jersey Devils: pesky. . . . One year ago 
tonight, the Kings lost to the Maple Leafs at Toronto in the opening game of 
their Campbell Conference championship series, 4-1.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CARTER HAS FOUR RBIS IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Carter drove in four runs and the Blue Jays ended their five-game losing 
streak, defeating the Detroit Tigers, 7-2, Monday night at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first time in a week-and-a-half I had an opportunity to drive 
some guys in," Carter said. "We scored early and that was a big boost for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter went three for four with a double. He leads the majors with 43 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't dizzy tonight, but he did have a bit of a headache," Toronto 
Manager Cito Gaston said of Carter, who sat out three straight games last week 
with dizziness, a result of vertigo caused by a viral infection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a migraine," Carter said, "and you have to play through those." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Guzman (4-4) benefitted from the early offense. After striking out the 
side in the first, he walked the bases loaded in the second, when the Tigers 
scored one run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays held a closed-door meeting before the game, hoping to figure out 
why the club had lost a season-high five straight and why it was one loss away 
from falling to three games below .500 for the first time since July 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 6, Seattle 4 -- Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 15th homer, a two-run 
shot, and Tom Gordon also gave a two-run homer to Tino Martinez. But Gordon 
(3-2) and the Royals got the win at Seattle. Gordon, who struck out eight, gave 
up only two other hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey homered for the third consecutive game, and tied Matt Williams for the 
most home runs in the majors. He was the Mariners' designated hitter, a day 
after he slightly hyperextended his right knee while running out a grounder. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 11, Oakland 7 -- Rusty Greer homered in his major league debut, then hit 
a two-run single in the 10th inning to lead the Rangers in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10th, Dean Palmer drew a leadoff walk from Billy Taylor (0-2) and Ivan 
Rodriguez singled with one out. Reliever Edwin Nunez walked Manuel Lee, loading 
the bases, and David Hulse singled home the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
 A's starter Bob Welch, 0-5 with a 9.53 ERA this season, couldn't get out of 
the first inning, giving up six runs.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; LAST SEASON'S VISIT NOT A HIGH NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time the Dodgers visited Mile High Stadium last season, they left 
with two of their starters facing the disabled list, Ramon Martinez facing 
suspension and Tim Wallach with a sore shoulder from tackling an angry Charlie 
Hayes.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the three-game series June 15-17, the Dodgers had won 18 of their last 
24 games and were tied for second place in the National League West. After the 
series, they went 2-12 until the All-Star Break and never rose above third 
place in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in a game June 16 that Colorado Rockie Andres Galarraga kicked Jody 
Reed in the elbow at second base in what he declared was retaliation against 
Martinez, whom he said had thrown at him at first base. Two brawls broke out 
during the game, after which Reed went on the disabled list.  
</P>
<P>
 Then after the final game, Darryl Strawberry, who made a humiliating fielding 
blunder, put himself on the disabled list to because of his surgically repaired 
back. It was the last regular-season game he has played as a Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi and Brett Butler hit their fourth triples Monday night, which 
leads the team and ties them for second in the league. . . . Chan Ho Park had 
another start Monday night for double-A San Antonio, and his earned-run average 
after 21 1/3 innings is 2.11. Park, who is working on his fastball, gave up one 
earned run in five innings, struck out six but walked four and had one wild 
pitch. In six starts, Park has given up 16 hits, five earned runs and 14 walks 
with 31 strikeouts.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers are in second place in the league behind the Houston Astros in 
stolen bases with 35. Delino DeShields leads the team with 12. Though 
DeShields' batting average was only .228 before Monday's game, he batted .400 
during the six-game homestand. . . . When the Dodgers moved into a tie for 
first place with the San Francisco Giants after Sunday's game, it was the first 
time since the third game of last season they have been in the top spot. After 
37 games last season, the Dodgers were nine games behind the Giants and in a 
tie for fifth place. MARYANN HUDSON

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ASTROS' ROOKIE SLIDES ONE PAST WILLIAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How's this for a pressure spot? 
</P>
<P>
 Bases loaded. Two outs. And your manager has just handed you the ball to face 
the National League's leading home run hitter with your team holding a one-run 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to make a 10-year veteran shaky, never mind a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was more pumped than nervous," said rookie Dave Veres, who then struck out 
Matt Williams to give the Houston Astros a 3-2 victory over the San Francisco 
Giants Monday night at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first two strikes went OK, but after it got to 2-2 things slowed down and 
got interesting," said Veres. "When the count got to 2-2, I threw a slider 
hoping he would swing at it. I was lucky and he took it for a strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams had hit his NL-leading 15th homer in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Veres (1-1) picked up his first major league victory despite facing only 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Veres had lost his major league debut May 10 to the Dodgers with one-third 
inning of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of weird, one-third of an inning and I get a loss, and one-third of 
an inning and I get a win." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell hit two homers for the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 7, St. Louis 2 -- Tom Foley and Lance Parrish, at the bottom of the 
batting order, combined for six RBIs at Pittsburgh to end Bob Tewksbury's 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley, a .196 hitter playing only because Jeff King has a sore wrist, drove in 
four runs and Parrish, who didn't have a major league job in spring training, 
went three for three with a homer and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley's four RBIs doubled his season total. 
</P>
<P>
 Tewksbury (7-1) lost for the first time since Sept. 21, giving up six runs on 
six hits over six innings while failing to become the first Cardinal since Bob 
Gibson in 1965 to start a season 8-0. He was trying to become the majors' first 
eight-game winner this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 3, New York 1 -- Chuck Carr, leading off the eighth, hit his third 
double of the game and then scored the go-ahead run as the Marlins beat Bret 
Saberhagen and the Mets at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberhagen (4-2) struck out 10 and walked none in eight innings, but gave up 
10 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 4, San Diego 2 -- Steve Buechele hit a two-run homer to give Anthony 
Young and the Cubs a victory at Chicago in a matchup of the National League's 
two worst teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Young (2-3), who benefited from three double plays, gave up five hits and two 
earned runs in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was only the Cubs' third in 17 games at home. The Padres have lost 
eight straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Curt Schilling, 16-7 last season, fell to 0-7 
with a loss at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Schilling, who allowed three runs and six hits in five innings, has not won 
since pitching a shutout in Game 5 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Butch Henry (1-0) allowed three hits in 5 2/3 innings to get the win. Dave 
Hollins had a first-inning homer off Henry and also a sixth-inning single. 
Hollins is now 12 for 15 with five homers and nine RBIs against Henry.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; ROTATION WON'T BE REVAMPED FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel officials met Monday to discuss the team's poor pitching but decided to 
make no decisions for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're going to stay where we are," Manager Buck Rodgers said. 
"We're re-evaluating, trying to decide if what we've got here is going to be 
better or what we have (in the minors) is going to be better." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers is reluctant to call up John Farrell or Russ Springer -- the two most 
obvious candidates for a spot in the rotation -- from triple-A Vancouver. 
Farrell is 4-4 with a 3.25 earned-run average. Springer is 2-4 with a 3.04 ERA. 
Rookie Andrew Lorraine is 3-1 with a 3.02 ERA, but the Angels would like to 
leave the 21-year-old in Vancouver for at least half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to say a guy who has pitched a couple of good games in triple-A is 
ready, but come sit in this chair and then say it," Rodgers said. "It's 
difficult to compare what they're doing on the triple-A level versus what that 
means at the major league level. I want to be as sure as I can before I make 
that choice." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which means that Mark Leiter, who has given up 22 runs in his last four 
starts, could get another chance Thursday night against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Greg Myers, who has been on the disabled list since suffering torn 
cartilage during a collision at home plate with Boston's Mike Greenwell on 
April 23, took batting practice for the first time since then Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt great. Actually, I didn't feel anything, which is great," Myers said. 
"Now I'm going to catch some guys in the bullpen and see how that goes. I'm 
optimistic, though." 
</P>
<P>
 The next step will be a rehabilitation assignment in the minors, but the 
Angels are in no hurry to rush Myers back into action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greg was catching as good as I've ever seen him catch and he was throwing as 
good as I've ever seen him throw," Rodgers said. "So we wouldn't want to see 
him get into any bad habits by favoring it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gary DiSarcina was a late scratch from the lineup Monday night after he was 
hit in the right eye while fielding a ground ball during batting practice. 
X-rays were negative and the injury is not considered serious, but DiSarcina 
was experiencing some blurred vision. . . . Chili Davis, who received six 
stitches below his left knee after sliding into the spikes of Seattle catcher 
Dan Wilson Saturday, will be available for specialized pinch-hitting duties 
only for the next few days. "It doesn't hurt at all, but they don't want to 
risk it popping open," Davis said. Rodgers said he would use Davis only in 
"non-running situations, when we need him to drive in a run, or a bunch of 
runs.". . . . The Angels' 9-5 loss Sunday to the Mariners took 3 hours 42 
minutes. "It had been an hour and 40 minutes and we were in the third inning," 
Rodgers said. "I told Harold (Reynolds) to keep talking out there because I 
didn't want anybody falling asleep." JOHN WEYLER

 Villa Park, hoping for a share of the Century League title, needed Foothill to 
falter last week.The Knights didn't, but the Spartans came through with two 
victories to keep the pressure on. McArthur was in the thick of things in both 
games. She was three for four with a home run and four runs batted in in an 8-2 
victory over Santa Ana Valley and pitched a one-hitter with 10 strikeouts in a 
1-0 victory over Canyon, which knocked the Comanches out of the playoffs. "We 
needed two wins and she helped us however she could," Spartan Coach David 
Shelton said. Other notables: 
</P>
<P>
 * Marcy Crouch, Marina, pitched a one-hitter in a 1-0 victory over Huntington 
Beach and a no-hitter in a 2-0 victory over Rosary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Angie Fancuberta, Fullerton, pitched two two-hitters -- one in a 7-0 victory 
over Buena Park and one in an eight-inning 2-1 win over Troy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Giana Johnson, Laguna Hills, won the 200-yard freestyle in 1:51.58 and the 
100 backstroke (57.36) at the Division II swimming championships.

PREP NOTES: KIM OUT OF SECTION SINGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunny Hills sophomore Kevin Kim has pulled out of the Southern Section singles 
tournament so he can practice for his upcoming stretch of clay-court 
tournaments. Kim, the No. 1-ranked boys' 16 player in the nation, did not play 
in the section individual tournament last year because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim competed in the Freeway League tournament, the section individual 
qualifying tournament, and defeated teammate Joseph Gilbert, 6-0, 6-2, in the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played league because my coach (Steve White) wanted me to," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kim said he had already decided to prepare for three upcoming clay-court 
tournaments by practicing at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks May 26-30, 
the same weekend of the section individual tournament at SeaCliff Tennis Club 
in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next two months, Kim will play on the red clay of Italy and France with 
other top-ranked players in the boys' 16 division. DAVE McKIBBEN

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY BEFORE IT DISAPPEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is happening to high school sports in Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
 The integrity in what many consider the last pure form of athletics seems to 
have been stripped away. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters these days spend as much time investigating bench-clearing brawls as 
covering games. There are more stories on coaches being suspended than on those 
who are picking up milestone victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Even parents have been held responsible for instigating fights in the stands 
this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 And please do not blame the media for looking for negative stories. The only 
ones to blame for all these problems are the athletes, their parents and the 
coaches, whose ethics seem to have taken an unfortunate turn for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Does none of this sound familiar? Perhaps a review of a few incidents is in 
order: 
</P>
<P>
 --Leodes Van Buren of Newbury Park, the state's top wide receiver last fall, 
was charged last Friday with firing a gun into the home of his girlfriend. If 
convicted, he is in jeopardy of losing his scholarship to Colorado, to say 
nothing of penalties courts might hand out. 
</P>
<P>
 --A week earlier, Reseda baseball player Alonzo Arreola was suspended for the 
rest of the season for punching a Chatsworth player during a postgame 
handshake. Reseda Coach Mike Stone called the incident "unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 --Players, coaches and fans were involved in a fight during a boys' basketball 
game between Gardena Serra and Santa Monica St. Monica in January. One parent 
was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon. When the teams played again, 
attendance was limited and security increased. 
</P>
<P>
 --Simi Valley boys' basketball Coach Dean Bradshaw was suspended midway 
through the season for shoving one of his players to the floor during a game. 
He has since been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 --And who can forget Stan Thomas being asked to resign in October for 
allegedly using his expense account to pay for lavish vacations, golf games and 
gas for his boat? 
</P>
<P>
 The list includes everything from sexual assault to recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Since high school athletics are only a small part of the education process, it 
is important to keep them in perspective. There is a public fascination with 
sports, and being part of a team teaches valuable lessons. But participation 
should still be regarded as a privilege, not a right. 
</P>
<P>
 Standards need to be set, followed and enforced. Elements that have negatively 
affected professional and collegiate athletics, such as fighting and cheating, 
simply cannot be allowed in prep sports. 
</P>
<P>
 How can next school year be different? 
</P>
<P>
 With open enrollment threatening to further encourage the building of all-star 
teams, integrity is more important than ever. It must begin at home, continue 
on the field, into the locker room and into the coaches' offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Things that have gone on this year cannot continue. Otherwise, there is 
nothing special about high school sports. It ends up being more of the same. 
And that is not OK. 
</P>
<P>

VALLEY/VENTURA ROUNDUP; CITY SECTION OVERHAULS FOOTBALL PLAYOFF SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Section on Monday overhauled the high school football playoff system 
for next season in an attempt to ensure that the best 32 teams advance to 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 Next fall, the two-division format will continue, but teams will not be placed 
into 4-A and 3-A brackets until after the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the six conferences, the team with the best record will be placed 
in the 16-team 4-A bracket. A committee composed of two administrators and 
members of the L.A. Football Coaches Assn. will select the remaining 10 teams 
in the 4-A bracket based on perceived strength and won-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining teams are eligible to play in the 3-A Division. The 16 playoff 
teams in that bracket will also be selected by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only difficulty I can see is who's No. 16 in the 4-A and who's No. 1 in 
the 3-A," said City Commissioner Barbara Fiege, who supported the revision. 
"You're either thrown to the wolves or you're the big cheese." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, teams had been predesignated by division before the season and 
placed in a four-team league with members of the same division. Leagues and 
divisions were juggled annually based on performance. Football 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Fong, The Times' 1993 Valley Coach of the Year after leading the St. 
Genevieve High football team to the Santa Fe League championship, resigned as 
football coach and athletic director to become offensive line coach at Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the feeling like I've done everything I can do in my capacity at St. 
Genevieve," Fong said. "It's nothing personal. I love the kids. I've just done 
everything I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Fong, 36, led the Valiants to a 9-3 record and the Santa Fe League 
championship last season after posting a combined record of 1-18 in his first 
two seasons at the school. Fong spent seven seasons at Crespi in the late 1980s 
as a varsity assistant and sophomore coach. Softball 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Berry, who started the Crescenta Valley High softball program 12 years 
ago, was named to replace Julie Astrachan as coach at Pierce College, Pierce 
Athletic Director Marian McWilliams announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry, 48, has a career record of 242-50. In 12 seasons, he led Crescenta 
Valley to eight Pacific League titles and a Southern Section 3-A Division 
championship in 1986. Berry will have seven assistant coaches, five of whom 
coached at Crescenta Valley this season. Astrachan will remain with the Pierce 
program as an assistant. Fred Frank was also hired as an assistant. Baseball 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a scheduling conflict over the availability of Dodger Stadium, the 
City Section baseball championships have been moved from June 9 to June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The first round of the playoffs begins May 27, with the quarterfinals June 1 
and the semifinals June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-A final will be played at 4 p.m. and the 4-A at 7:30. Miscellany 
</P>
<P>
 The City Section has reversed a ruling of a year ago and again will allow 
out-of-season contact between coaches and players. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the City barred off-season contact except during the summer. Under 
the revised rule, players and coaches will be allowed to compete in the 
off-season during a three-week period. The time frame will vary by sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The change will allow teams to again compete in spring football passing 
leagues. A summer dead period for fall sports also was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Contact between coaches and players in all sports will be allowed between June 
1 to Aug. 31, though participation in events such as summer-league basketball 
or seven-on-seven passing leagues is not sanctioned by schools. Roundup 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar 15, North Hollywood 2 -- The Spartans (24-3, 15-0 in league play) 
pounded 16 hits, scored in all but one inning and clinched their second 
consecutive East Valley League baseball title with two games remaining.

<P>
 Hiram Damwijk went four for five for Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>

the first inning and coasted past Grant (10-11, 7-8) in an East Valley League

 Poly's big inning was capped by Jaime Cerna's three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham 6, Canoga Park 4 -- Pedro Rodriguez went three for four and David 
Cohen had two hits and three RBIs to lead the first-place Braves (12-13, 8-7)

<P>

BOOK REVIEW / SCIENCE; NATURE VERSUS NURTURE IN SEX DIFFERENCES; EVE'S RIB; 
SEARCHING FOR THE BIOLOGICAL ROOTS OF SEX DIFFERENCES BY ROBERT POOL ; CROWN 
PUBLISHERS; $22, 320 PAGES

<P>
 If you've never looked closely at a pack of hyenas, you'll surely want to 
after reading the introduction to "Eve's Rib." Hyenas, Robert Pool tells us, 
differ from other mammals because both sexes sport either male or 
male-look-alike genitalia, and specially for them nature has evolved a 
mind-boggling solution to the usually simple matter of copulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does Pool begin his first book, an examination of the biological roots of 
sex in people, with an account of a non-human animal? So he can draw an 
analogy, of course. In hyenas, as in people, it's a question of hormones. A 
pregnant hyena's blood is so rich in the male hormone testosterone that the 
resulting litter boasts the most aggressive infants -- female and male -- in 
all mammaldom. 
</P>
<P>
 With humans, as a rule, only males get drenched in testosterone; but in 
special cases, which Pool describes in elegant detail, little girls with 
chromosomal or developmental anomalies receive an extra dollop of uterine 
testosterone. These "tomboys" are super-aggressive, scorn dolls in favor of 
trucks, and a favored few excel in mathematical problems that demand spatial 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this book, Pool enters the nature-nurture debate as it applies to sexual 
differences. He tries to give equal attention to both sides, and insists that 
the positions are complementary rather than opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, he concludes that, while socialization is very important, 
"the question here was what type of role nature plays in creating differences 
between males and females. The answer is: a major one." 
</P>
<P>
 He supports this conclusion with descriptions of psychological, 
endocrinological and neurobiological research, beginning with the study done at 
Johns Hopkins University in the 1970s in which highly gifted junior high school 
boys outperformed similarly gifted girls in a special mathematics program. 
</P>
<P>
 He interviews a complicated network of researchers whose studies range from 
the Hopkins exploration of women and math to an examination of how men and 
women recover differently from stroke in terms of the organization of the male 
and female brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing evidence that girls and boys are different from the first days of life, 
and that groups of little boys behave differently from groups of little girls 
(as any parent will testify), we are convinced, if we had many doubts to begin 
with, that boys are different from girls. 
</P>
<P>
 How much difference there is, and what this difference implies, is another 
matter. If there are more male math geniuses than female math geniuses, what 
has that to do with most men and women who are not geniuses? What about the 
skills of people in the middle of the curve? 
</P>
<P>
 Pool has interesting information about the rest of us. Studies of infants, for 
instance, show that from the very first hours of life, the sexes differ in 
making eye contact. Is there a connection between early sociability, the ways 
girls and boys meet the world, and the apparently different ways that our 
brains are organized? There is no answer . . . yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can anyone explain the origins of the differences we can expose. They are 
lost in our evolutionary past when, Pool suggests, it may have been 
advantageous for our ancestral hunter-gatherer menfolk to be proto-engineers 
and the womenfolk to be proto-homemakers. But whatever the reasons, we are 
struck with these differences today, even as we work to level the playing field 
in a very different world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pool is struck by the rigor of the scientists he interviews, and by the fact 
that they are overwhelmingly women who were educated in the '70s when the idea 
of nurture was more popular on campuses than the idea of nature . Whatever 
their politics then and now, he describes them as a mixed batch -- married, 
divorced and single, social scientists, biologists and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pool's interest in their private lives is part of the pervasive subtext to 
what is often a remarkable book. This subtext is spelled out in his dedication: 
"To the love of my life, my sage and my wife, Amy." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, his devotion has leaked into his narrative, and Amy's talents, 
whims and personal conflicts about her approaching maternity become a secondary 
theme. While not exactly his co-author, Amy is omnipresent. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too bad he didn't pursue the solution reached by Camilla Benbow (one of 
the Hopkins researchers) who has seven children and chairs the psychology 
department at Iowa State University, or the decision of Sandra Witelson at 
McMaster University to stop at one for fear that another child would have 
jeopardized her chance of getting tenure. By universalizing his marriage, Pool 
has reduced the impact of this rich material to an apologetic shrug.

ANGELS, STANDING PAT, LOSE TO WHITE SOX, 8-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They met Monday afternoon and debated the ramifications of rising earned-run 
averages, lowered standards and the possibility of replacing one of their 
struggling starters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, they decided the best course of action was no action. It seems 
Angel Manager Buck Rodgers, General Manager Bill Bavasi and assistant GM Tim 
Mead can't get anyone out either. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for the time being at least, the Angels' rotation remains the same and 
Monday night it was Phil Leftwich's turn. In this time of reduced expectations, 
he came through with what might be considered a quality start, California 
style. Leftwich gave up three earned runs in 5 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the Angels have scored 40 runs in the last five games and have 
managed to win only twice. This time, it was the Chicago White Sox who 
discovered that batting practice lasts about five hours when you face the 
Angels these days. They pounded five Angel pitchers for 12 hits en route to an 
8-5 victory in front of 21,387 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's either trying to pitch too fine or they don't have control, but 
it seems like we're always behind (in the count) 2-0 or 3-1," Rodgers said. "I 
can't believe their control is that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starters may not be sticking around that long, but they're getting in 
plenty of work. In the past two games, Joe Magrane and Leftwich have combined 
for 9 2/3 innings of work . . . and 239 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox countered with Scott Sanderson, who jumped out to a 7-2 start 
with a 2.82 earned-run average for the Angels last year then lost nine of his 
next 11 starts before he was released in July. The White Sox signed him as a 
free agent in February and the 37-year-old right-hander has been doing exactly 
what Rodgers wishes he could persuade most of his beleaguered pitching staff to 
do: be aggressive. In 30 1/3 innings this season, Sanderson has walked only two 
batters while striking out 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scotty will go at you," Rodgers said. "He isn't afraid to pitch inside. He's 
a gamer." 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich, on the other hand, was almost a goner a week ago. On the brink of 
losing his spot in the rotation, he got a reprieve when Brian Anderson broke 
his thumb while trying to field a ground ball bare-handed. Leftwich responded 
to the opportunity by giving up only one run in his last start, but he wasn't 
quite as sharp Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out getting ahead of the majority of the guys and I felt real 
strong," Leftwich said. "But I was trying not to let their RBI guys hurt me and 
I started pitching around them a little bit instead of making quality pitches 
early in the count." 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Ventura gave Chicago a 1-0 lead when he hit his ninth homer of the 
season leading off the second. The White Sox got two more in the third when Tim 
Raines singled, Joey Cora walked and both scored when Dwight Smith misplayed 
Julio Franco's double to left. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith got back the run he gave away in the bottom of the third, however, 
hitting his first home run in Anaheim Stadium. One out later, Chad Curtis 
evened the score, 3-3, with an opposite-field rocket to right-center that could 
be considered more evidence for the juiced-ball theory. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox regained the lead in the fifth and Rodgers probably went through 
a roll of antacids along the way. Raines and Cora singled with one out and then 
Leftwich walked Frank Thomas to load the bases. Franco lined out to center to 
score Raines, but when Leftwich walked Ventura to reload the bases, Rodgers 
stomped to the mound and delivered an animated throw-a-damn-strike lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told him to stop beating himself and to make them beat him," Rodgers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels went ahead, 5-4, in the sixth when Bo Jackson, putting together his 
first three-hit game of the season, led off with a single and eventually scored 
on Jorge Fabregas' single to center. Fabregas stole second and scored on Harold 
Reynolds' double to right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 That was it for Sanderson, who failed to improve to 4-0 at his former 
teammates' expense, but it wasn't the end of the Angel pitchers' misery. Cora 
and Thomas opened the seventh with back-to-back singles off Mike Butcher and 
both scored and Franco ended up on third when Curtis let Franco's single to 
center get past him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to get very good defense when your infielders and 
outfielders have to get set and then back off for a 100-some pitches in the 
first five innings," Rodgers said. "We thought we had gotten over the hump 
there when we got the lead in the sixth. We were heading into the home stretch 
with a lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "That takes a little starch out of you."

ANGEL BULLPEN IS BATTERED, BEATEN AGAIN; BASEBALL: BUTCHER AND LEITER ARE THE 
LATEST RELIEVERS TO FALTER AND LOSE A LEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Again and again the gates opened and another Angel relief pitcher jogged to 
the mound to try his luck. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a parade of futility, largely a march of disappointment for Manager 
Buck Rodgers Monday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Phil Leftwich was only so-so, and Rodgers needed help early in the 
game. This wasn't an isolated incident, coming against the American League's 
top hitting team, and that made Monday's run through the bullpen tougher for 
Rodgers to stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 No, an 8-5 loss to the Chicago White Sox marked the third consecutive game in 
which the Angel relievers were battered and beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not happy with the way our bullpen is pitching right now," Rodgers said. 
"The lefties are getting the job done, but our righties aren't getting their 
guys out." 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad Rodgers has only Craig Lefferts and Bob Patterson as his left-handed 
relievers. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the bullpen couldn't hold a 7-4 lead as the Seattle Mariners rallied 
for a 10-7 victory thanks to a four-run eighth inning off Joe Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, John Dopson gave up three runs in the eighth inning and Seattle turned 
a two-run lead into a 9-5 runaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's adventures in protecting a lead included a three-run seventh for 
Chicago against Mike Butcher. To be fair, an error by Chad Curtis contributed 
to the jam. But Butcher did give up three consecutive hits without recording an 
out before Rodgers replaced him with Lefferts. 
</P>
<P>
 At least Lefferts offered stability. He gave up only one hit in one inning of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers was out of arms to start the eighth, so he brought starter Mark Leiter 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Leiter's throwing day, anyway," Rodgers said. "Kevin Brown of Texas 
did that to us the other day, so it's not an indication of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving Leiter to the bullpen is probably an alternative down the road, but 
there are numerous possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Leiter started Saturday's game, going 2 2/3 innings and giving up 
four runs and six hits with one strikeout and two walks. That start probably 
sealed his fate. Although it went into the books as a no-decision, he had lost 
three in a row going into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter joined the worn-out bullpen and seemed to fit right in, laboring 
through a rocky ninth in which he gave up one run and one hit with one walk and 
two hit batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a day of rest for the bullpen hasn't been easy for Rodgers, which 
seems to complicate matters in the late innings of recent games. 
</P>
<P>
 But with his starters failing to last longer than six innings the last three 
games, it has been difficult. The nature of the game also hurts. High-scoring 
games are the norm. The Angels haven't played a game this season in which fewer 
than five runs have been scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the game right now," Rodgers said. "That's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to know whether the Angels play high-scoring games because 
opposing teams hit the ball so well or because their bullpen is so weak.

 As more members of Generation X enter the work force, their baby boomer bosses 
are finding they have a very different approach, Training magazine reports.They 
aren't as career-oriented -- they believe work is "what you do so you can have 
a life." But that doesn't mean they're bad workers. Xers are better with 
computers and work well on their own.

 Out of 1,000 adults surveyed for the Better Sleep Council: 
</P>
<P>
 * A third reported that sleeplessness affects their job performance. (The tab 
for workplace weariness is at least $15.8 billion in direct costs, according to 
the National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research.)  
</P>
<P>
 * 20% admit dozing at work, with men twice as likely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 30% do not feel rested when they wake up for work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 20% have called in sick or been late due to lack of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 * 40% say working long hours sometimes keeps them from getting the sleep they 
need. (The Economic Policy Institute calculates that workers have added an 
extra month to their annual work and commute time since 1969.) Launch Early 
Strike to Ward Off Fleas 
</P>
<P>
 Ten measly fleas can produce 90,000 eggs in 30 days in your home. 
</P>
<P>
 (Makes you want to scratch, huh?) 
</P>
<P>
 So veterinarians are advising pet owners to treat dogs and their environment 
in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Start prevention methods three to six weeks before the weather normally 
approaches 70 degrees and humidity 50%, which is when fleas make serious 
whoopee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask your veterinarian to suggest easy-to-apply insecticides with some staying 
power, such as permethrin-based products, which tend to work up to 28 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a flea and tick shampoo, followed by a cream rinse. Then apply an 
insecticide after proper drying. 
</P>
<P>
 Use a carpet spray for carpeted areas, upholstered furniture and pet bedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Spritz all cracks and crevices on the floor and under baseboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Spray the yard and kennel. 
</P>
<P>
 While you're at it, clean up pine thatch and leaf piles -- bugs' favorite 
egg-laying spots. 
</P>
<P>
 As for those cats that will tear you to shreds at the mention of a home 
treatment, go to a veterinarian or pet groomer and pop for the flea dips. Keep 
a Close Eye on Contact-Lens Hygiene 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow you confuse disposable contacts with dispensable hygiene when it comes 
to taking proper care of your lenses. These contacts require special care. Here 
are some tips to minimize problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * White dots indicate protein deposits. Disinfect lenses nightly if you are a 
daily wearer and discard every two weeks. If you wear contacts overnight, 
discard weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check edges for tiny defects, a common problem with weekly disposable 
lenses. Chips along the edge may appear as scallops that can split or tear. If 
the disposable lens is torn in half while in the eye, you may have difficulty 
removing the pieces. See your doctor if this occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 * You should have follow-up visits with your eye doctor more frequently if you 
wear contact lenses overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 * This health roundup, compiled by C.A. Wedlan from wire service reports, 
appears in Life & Style on Tuesdays.

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY: MAY FLOWERS AS TOWERS OF ART SPRING UP; THE 33RD 
ANNUAL DAMAS DE CARIDAD BAL MASQUE GIVES RISE TO A 'KALEIDOSCOPE' OF 
HEADDRESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even Carmen Miranda in her largest fruit-laden headdress would have been no 
match for the eight women who modeled towering floral headdresses at the 33rd 
annual Damas de Caridad Bal Masque. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of about 500 guests showed up at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim on 
Saturday to view what has become a one-of-a-kind parade featuring living floats 
-- a spectacle akin to a Rose Parade with legs. The $185-per-person gala was 
expected to net $70,000 for St. Jude Medical Center's Care for the Poor Mobile 
Pediatric Clinic. Balancing Act 
</P>
<P>
 Each headdress weighs about 30 pounds, including seven to nine pounds of fresh 
flowers, and measures six feet tall by six feet wide. While the models, or 
"mannequins," look like they're balancing the weight on their heads, the float 
is supported by a rod that runs down their backs and onto their hips. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the floats are balanced, it's like wearing a hat; if they're not balanced, 
it's a chore," said Sandee Johnson, production chairwoman and former mannequin. 
</P>
<P>
 Floormen are stationed along the runway to catch the mannequins if they fall. 
No mannequin has lost her headdress in the history of the ball. Except for one 
scary moment when mannequin Grace Hunt looked like she would topple under the 
weight of a float bearing huge butterflies, the parade was trouble-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Each mannequin performed a dance routine while wearing her huge headdress. 
Some made it look easy. Corky Winters shimmied and shook as a Marilyn Monroe 
look-alike lip-syncing to "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" while supporting 
a frothy pink headdress with large diamond shapes. Her float, "Diamonds in 
Motion," the sweepstakes winner, was the work of florist Andrea Miko. 
</P>
<P>
 Polly Hairabedian performed a lively boogie as the "Neon Queen of the Night." 
Her eye-popping float with its hot pink and green zigzag shapes, the creation 
of Randy Duncan and Rob Mitten, was first runner-up and glowed in the dark when 
the lights went out. 
</P>
<P>
 Second runner-up Carol Rodriguez, a professional dancer, had no trouble 
managing the "Strictly Ballroom" float designed by Jillian and Percy Browne. 
She twirled under a faux mirrored ball that spun above her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first it's a little intimidating, but once you get used to the headdress 
you control it," she said. "Then you just take off." Human Floats 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers chose "Kaleidoscope" as the ball theme to give floral designers 
freedom to use whatever shapes and colors they wanted in their floats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kaleidoscope can be any vision you choose," said Nancy Dahl, ball chairwoman, 
who sported a gown with a kaleidoscope of multicolored faux gems. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the interpretations: a massive sunburst called "Celestial Kaleidoscope" 
modeled by mannequin Joni Hutain; a float that changed from ice-blue winter to 
flaming hot summer called "Seasons" modeled by Sharon Haight; an abstract float 
of intersecting geometric planes called "New Age Coming" modeled by Judy 
McFadden and -- the people's choice winner -- "Come Fly With Me," a hot air 
balloon worn by Maria Xanthos. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballroom reflected the kaleidoscope concept; it was decked in flowers of 
all types and colors on the tables and along the runway. Dinner -- beef 
bordelaise and filet of salmon with tiramisu for dessert -- was served at 
tables adorned with colorful masks in keeping with the ball's masquerade 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1961 by Marcy Mulville, Bal Masque began as a way for Damas de 
Caridad (Ladies of Charity) to drum up support and awareness for St. Jude 
hospital in Fullerton. Proceeds provide medical care, inoculations, checkups, 
referrals and other services to children in North Orange County via St. Jude's 
mobile pediatric clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years, women modeled much smaller hats, the size of a Miranda 
headdress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when they were 12-inches high. As florists ideas have grown, so 
have the headdresses," said Beverly Swanson, president of Damas de Caridad. 
</P>
<P>
 Other participating florists were Lynn Levine, "Come Fly With Me"; Anna 
Davidson and Mary Jo Brett, "Earthbound"; Donna Wallace, Janet Bustos, Jerry 
Wang, Cindy Sichting and Ruth Carlin, "Celestial Kaleidoscope"; Erni Olson, 
Jeff Shadic and Barbara Kishiyama, "Seasons," and Mark Massad and Bill Davis, 
"New Age Coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Faces in the crowd included: Wayne Wedin, master of ceremonies, and his wife, 
Doretta; Sandee Johnson, production chairwoman; Dee Dee Madrigal, 
choreographer; Sandra Wessel, Phil Rulloda and Michelle Lofthouse, judges; 
Patricia Maysent, president and CEO of St. Jude Medical Center; Robert and 
Dorothy Beaver, David and Beverly Bates, Pat and James Blake, Jim Charter, Mike 
and Vicki Crow, Sam and Judy Doolittle, Robert and Peggy Harbour, David and 
Emily Johnson, Carl and Margaret Karcher, Shirley Kerstner, Gene and Nadine 
Leyton and Mel and Susan Shaw. KATHRYN BOLD

DOW EDGES UP AS EYES TURN TO FED PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks crept to a mixed close Monday, while bond yields fell for a third 
straight day on expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates 
high enough today to quell any threat of renewed inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue chips got a boost from the bond market, but the broader indexes were 
weak, hurt for the second straight session by a downturn in the shares of 
technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 11.82 points at 3,671.5. But in the 
broader market, declines beat advances by about 6 to 5 on moderate volume of 
234.7 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, down from Friday's 252.08 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 A spike in commodity prices erased some of early gains in the bond market. The 
price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond closed up 17/32 point, or $5.31 
per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, 
fell to 7.44% from 7.49% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most market players expect the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee to 
decide at its policy-making meeting today to raise short-term interest rates to 
check inflation pressures, which tend to accompany strong economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent string of economic reports, including news Monday on April 
industrial production, seemed to have softened the urgency for big rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed reported industrial production increased 0.3%, despite a drop in auto 
production. It also reported that industrial companies were operating at 83.6% 
of capacity, unchanged from the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures, which were roughly in line with expectations, followed government 
reports late last week of low consumer and producer inflation in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view is the data we've had over the last three trading days say the Fed 
still needs to continue with the program but there's no need to rush," said 
Alan Levenson, money-market economist at the UBS Securities unit of Union Bank 
of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has hiked the fed funds rate by a quarter point three times since 
early February, sparking an extended downturn that shaved almost 10% off the 
Dow's record high of 3,978.36, set Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poors index of 500 stocks 
rose 0.35 to 444.49, while the NYSE's composite index rose 0.02 to 245.78. The 
Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller issues fell 5.01 to 711.91. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Wal-Mart Stores lost 1 1/4 to 22 3/4. The company announced first-quarter 
earnings of 22 cents a share vs 20 cents in the same three months of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology shares were among the hardest hit. Cisco Systems fell 3/4 to 22 
1/2, while Wellfleet Communications lost 4 to 27 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Omega Environmental fell down 3 1/4 to 5 7/8 after Mabon Securities 
downgraded the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems unit and long-distance 
company Sprint said they were in talks about a possible merger. GM's class E 
shares gained 1 1/2 to 34 1/2 and Sprint added 1 to 37 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Great Lakes Chemical sank 5 3/4 to 49 1/2 after it said earnings will not 
meet analyst projections. 
</P>
<P>
 * O'Sullivan Industries lost 6 1/2 to 9 7/8. After the close of trading on 
Friday, the company said it expects sales for the fourth quarter ending June 30 
to fall between 5% and 10% below year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks, particularly computer networking shares, came under 
renewed assault on the Nasdaq market, sparked by Cisco Systems' plunge Friday. 
Cisco fell another 3/4 to 22 1/2, Wellfleet Communications dropped 4 to 27 3/4 
and 3Com shed 3 7/8 to 51 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * O'Sullivan Industries, a maker of ready-to-assemble furniture, tumbled 6 1/2 
to 9 7/8 on heavy volume. It said late Friday that it expects its sales and 
earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter to be below the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets were mixed. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average closed down 
82.31 points at 20,188.44, while in Europe, Frankurt's 30-share DAX average 
ended at 2,271.11, up 12.36 points. In London, the key Financial Times 
100-share average fell 3.6 points to 3,115.6. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index dipped a slight 0.33 point to 2,239.84. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the dollar was mixed against other major currencies Monday in light 
trading as dealers waited for the Fed's next move. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices advanced in U.S. trading, closing in New York at $383.00 an ounce, 
up $2.30. Silver fetched $5.563, up 16.3 cents.

 Interest Rates on Treasury Bills Decline: The Treasury Department sold $12.1 
billion of new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.22%, down 
from 4.32% last week. Another $12 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an 
average discount rate of 4.69%, down from 4.81%.The rates were the lowest since 
May 2 when the three-month bills sold for 4% and the six-month bills averaged 
4.41%. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 
4.33% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,893.30 and 4.87% 
for a six-month bill selling for $9,762.90. The discount rate reflects the 
price discount received when government securities are purchased at less than 
face value. T-Bill Auction

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; FILM FESTIVAL SERVING AS TRADE FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the world's biggest celebration of the cinematic art in full swing here, 
American and European entertainment representatives on Monday also confronted 
their differences over the art of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides said progress was made in the transatlantic trade discussions 
sponsored by the American Film Marketing Assn. But the public spirit of 
cooperation was undercut by French Minister of Culture Jacques Toubon's calling 
for the dismantlement in Europe of United International Pictures, the overseas 
distributor for three Hollywood studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Toubon was quoted earlier Monday as saying UIP, owned by Universal Pictures, 
Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, should be abolished for violating 
free-market rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The distributor has been operating under a European antitrust waiver it is 
trying to get renewed. Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America, said that any move against UIP would disrupt the current talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be distressful and cause real problems," Valenti said at the 
meeting. "But at this point, we expect a sane and reasonable conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 While Monday's gathering brought together an unusually large contingent of 
American and European executives, talks have been going on casually since late 
last year, when the U.S. entertainment industry was excluded from the sweeping 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by Europeans who accused Hollywood of 
monopolizing their theaters and airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The European Union is to take up a range of policy recommendations -- 
including stringent quotas and increased taxes on American products -- in 
Brussels next month, but no formal move is expected before fall. Meanwhile, 
groups such as the AFMA and the MPAA are battling to preserve their place in 
the vital European market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Colette Flesch of the European Union said the talks have already moved in a 
conciliatory direction. "There was no saber rattling," she said, adding that 
the biggest disagreement is over how to make a success of Europe's industry. 
Flesch also held her group apart from Toubon, noting that it has yet to take a 
formal position on the future of UIP. 
</P>
<P>
 AFMA President Jonas Rosenfeld agreed that the meeting was without rancor. He 
said that for once, no one had accused the United States of conspiring against 
European interests. Valenti repeated his post-GATT mantra that a strong 
Hollywood presence benefits Europe by drawing more people to local theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly observing the press conference was Bernard Miyet, who represented the 
hard-line French government in the GATT talks and, oddly, has since become a 
leading shuttle diplomat between Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants to cool down the pressure now," he said Monday, neglecting to 
acknowledge Toubon's stand on UIP. That "kind of passion at GATT was useless 
for everyone." 
</P>

 At the Carlton Hotel a few days ago, Fine Line Pictures gave an elegant 
luncheon, with director Roman Polanski and actors Sigourney Weaver and Ben 
Kingsley, to celebrate the North American acquisition of Polanski's "Death and 
the Maiden." Reporters and others dined on grilled lamb and potato mousse in a 
room festooned with provocative production photos by Helmut Newton. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, Polygram Filmed Entertainment flew in actors Meg Ryan and 
Kevin Kline to announce their participation in "Paris Match," which won't start 
production until fall. Polygram had already caused a big stir here with "The 
Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," a story of drag queen showgirls 
in the Australian outback. 
</P>
<P>
 Beachfront posters promoting "Priscilla" say "Drag is the Drug," but any 
Cannes Film Festival regular knows that positive buzz is the drug here -- both 
for driving sales to film distributors and building audience awareness. By that 
measure, Fine Line, Polygram and Miramax Films -- which alone has four pictures 
in the official competition -- are mainlining. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I view it as a really positive development," said Fine Line President Ira 
Deutchman. "What's the point of having a film festival if the only thing people 
focus on is the same films they focus on the rest of the year?" 
</P>
<P>
 While they have always been the key players at Cannes, small companies are 
generating even more media heat this year, partly because the major studios 
have all but cleared the playing field. The smaller companies also have deeper 
pockets since the industry shake-out that saw Castle Rock Entertainment and New 
Line Cinema -- Fine Line's parent -- sold to Ted Turner, Miramax acquired by 
Walt Disney Co. and Sony's purchase of the former Orion Classics. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing for the spotlight tonight are tiny Nest Entertainment, which has 
rented a castle in the hills above Cannes to promote its animated feature, "The 
Swan Princess," to 300 of its closest friends, and Castle Rock, giving a major 
event at the Hotel du Cap (which is so exclusive it's not even in Cannes). 
Miramax plans a party Friday at the Carlton Beach restaurant in honor of "Pulp 
Fiction."

 Multimedia: Twentieth Century Fox, the only major studio that has yet to 
venture into the trendy and potentially lucrative multimedia business, plans 
this week to announce the launch of a video game division. Former Fox President 
Strauss Zelnick laid plans for the interactive unit before he left last year to 
head a start-up video game company in Silicon Valley.The studio is said to have 
already committed funding to the development of a video game based on its 
upcoming Christmas release "Pagemaster," a mix of live action and animation 
starring Macaulay Culkin of "Home Alone" fame. Once dismissed as a passing 
kids' fad, the video game business -- whose $6 billion in annual revenue 
exceeds the movie industry's domestic box-office take -- has come to be viewed 
by entertainment companies as a way to get more out of their investments in 
film and television properties. Fox Chairman Peter Chernin, company President 
Bill Mechanic and Al Ovadia, president of Fox's licensing division, are 
scheduled to discuss the new unit at a Friday press briefing. AMY HARMON

O.C. ART REVIEWS / CATHY CURTIS; TAPPING A TALENT LONG UNNOTICED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On those rare occasions in the 1920s and early '30s when August Gay could be 
persuaded to pick up his paintbrush, he built slabs of color into strong, 
rhythmic compositions with a forcefulness that belied the small size of his 
canvases. Nobody else had his knack for remaking the familiar, even banal, 
sights of Monterey and environs into seductive images. 
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder, though, that Gay is not a household word, even in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The French-born artist painted few works, sold virtually nothing, won no 
prizes, kept no records or journals, apparently carried on no correspondence 
and rarely even bothered to date his paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in Oakland and Monterey, he scraped up a meager living in warehouses or 
fish canneries and seems to have spent the rest of his time hanging out with 
his artist buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 'teens, they formed a Post Impressionist-inspired group called The Six, 
which began to exhibit together in 1923. (Other members were Maurice Logan, 
Louis Siegriest, Bernard von Eichman, William Clapp and Gay's sometimes friend, 
supporter and housemate Seldon Connor Gile.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now, thanks to patient detective work on the part of Jo Farb Hernandez, former 
director of the Monterey Peninsula Museum of Art, Gay is the focus of a 
beguiling show at the Laguna Art Museum through Oct. 9. Amazingly, this is 
Gay's first solo exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most disarmingly lovely paintings on view is "Untitled (Garden 
Scene)," an undated image of an idyllic domestic hideaway in which broad, 
meandering yellow brush strokes surround floating flowerpots and a red wicker 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
 In another memorable image, "Old Marsh's Studio," from 1931, the stepped roof 
of a flat, white building and the repetitive layers of abstracted green and 
pink vegetation form a tightly knit formal unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Something happened to Gay's style between these two works, and catalogue 
essayist Nancy M. Boas suggests it was the influence of the "geometrical 
compositions and darkly evocative colors" he saw in a 1926 exhibition of 
paintings by Wassily Kandinsky, Alexei Jawlensky, Paul Klee and Lyonel 
Feininger at the tiny Oakland Art Gallery -- a forward-looking venue run by 
Clapp. 
</P>
<P>
 Faithful to The Six's belief in spontaneous-looking compositions of 
small-scale rural settings and flirtations with European modernism, Gay was 
unique by virtue of his fascination with juxtapositions of flat swatches of 
color and his knack for distilling landscapes and seaside views into arresting 
patterns of solids and voids. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature tends to be a benign, supportive presence in Gay's paintings. In 
"Untitled (Cabins)," the awkward, uneven shapes of the sides and roofs of what 
must have been a cluster of derelict buildings offer an angular counterpoint to 
the enfolding rim of a nearby hillside. In "Corral: Hatton Ranch," one of Gay's 
few images with a broad spatial compass, golden fields embrace a soft hillock 
with casually sprawling geometric buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, not every painting in the show is a winner. Some works veer too 
far toward literalness, while other canvases are too schematic. With the 
exception of a few strongly stylized paintings (such as "Drying Their Nets, 
Fisherman, Monterey"), the dockside views tend to be rather dull and 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay might have made further breakthroughs had his utterly unambitious "career" 
not petered out altogether, in favor of stable employment as a furniture 
carver. During the 1930s, the Depression, Gay's personal money problems, the 
breakup of The Six and an infection that required part of his finger to be 
amputated all provided excuses for him to abandon easel painting. 
</P>
<P>
 His work in the mid-'30s on a massive Federal Arts Project mural with a 
fishing theme for Pacific Grove High School was destroyed by fire a few years 
later. Another high school mural was consigned to a storage room. By 1948, when 
he died at 57 (of causes unexplained in the catalogue essay), Gay hadn't even 
had a show in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the passage of nearly half a century has added luster to Gay's work. He 
deserves to be remembered as one of the minority of early 20th-Century 
California artists who gave a new spin to the local landscape without recourse 
to academic pieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Robust yet delicate, engaging without being cloying, Gay's paintings are like 
the sort of delectable minor vintage that you still remember with pleasure even 
after many a grand cru . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good connections cut both ways in the museum world. 
</P>
<P>
 They can weigh down an exhibition schedule with frivolous shows mounted to 
suit the whims of Mr. High Roller, in the hopes that he will eventually donate 
big bucks or desirable objects he's in danger of giving to a rival museum. 
</P>
<P>
 But good connections also can genuinely enrich a museum's offerings with 
objects that may be difficult to obtain from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, through May 29, the latter situation prevails at the Bowers Museum of 
Cultural Art. A modest sampling of Japanese paintings and lacquer ware from the 
collection of Etsuko and Joe Price -- Corona del Mar neighbors of museum 
director Peter Keller -- are on display in the Leo Freedman Galleria, the 
hallway between the admission desk and the galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prices are widely known for their major collection of art from Japan's Edo 
Period (1603-1868), as well as for the Pavilion for Japanese art at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art (built with the help of their $5-million 
donation), which contains 300 pieces from their holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 With one exception, the paintings on view are all of the natural world, 
inscribed with brief poems (translated on the labels) that evoke wistful images 
of wind, water, growing things and minute shifts in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The most appealing of the paintings to contemporary Western eyes are the ones 
executed in the "boneless" technique of the Rimpa school, in which objects 
appear to be practically breathed onto the paper, with highly controlled 
concentrations of ink and no outlines. The tension between persuasive evocation 
of plants and animals and tautly decorative stylization gives these works their 
refined appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sakai Hoitsu's painting, "Egret and Water Plant," the long-legged, 
white-breasted bird is set off by tall, green fronds, tense sprays of tiny 
flowers and a pale film of pond water. The brown edges of the leaves suggest 
their short lease on life. This image of decay seems a mild reminder of the 
cycle of life and death. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiba Kokan drew on his studies of natural science for exquisitely detailed 
images of a beetle, cicada and wasp in his painting "Insects and Plants" -- all 
the more miraculous because of the seemingly effortless way he directs the 
thinnest rivulets of ink. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cricket Basket," by Shibata Zeshin, is not in the Rimpa style, but this 
skinny, slot-like painting -- which has an effect almost like peeking through a 
keyhole -- has the piquant appeal of chain reactions set off by mischievous 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The cricket's cage has tipped over, unfurling a bright red, fringed cloth that 
apparently was wrapped around it and setting free the insect, which balances 
tentatively on top of its former jail. The mature, wistful tone of the 
accompanying poem about crickets in autumn offers a poignant contrast to the 
merry disarray of the image. 
</P>
<P>
 The lacquer ware -- a variety of boxes and other useful objects, made from 
multiple layers of lacquer tree sap applied to a wood or fabric core -- has a 
showy prettiness. Sprinklings of gold dust and inlays of mother-of-pearl create 
stylized renderings of running water, insects, leaves and flowers, and an 
autumn moon or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a couple of tea caddies in the show actually date from the Meiji period 
(1868-1912), the only historically jarring note is the group of 10 ivory 
sculptures of leaves made in 1981 by Okuda Kodo. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the lacquer ware, these pieces were made to serve no useful function. 
They are collectors' trinkets: lacy, painted in modulated hues, 
ever-so-realistically curled and torn, but lacking (unlike the historical 
pieces) a sense of their own time and place. 
</P>

MUSIC REVIEWS; YOUTH IS SERVED IN FINALE; THE O.C. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA'S PROGRAM 
INCLUDES CHILD PERFORMERS NOMI AND ARTHUR ABADI PLAYING CONCERTOS BY THE YOUNG 
MOZART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 11th-season finale of the Orange County Chamber Orchestra was something of 
a kiddie show, featuring music of the young Mozart and even younger performers. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, held Sunday afternoon at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, focused on 
the piano concertos of the composer, with some rarely heard tidbits from his 
teen-age years (or earlier, depending on whom you believe), and a masterwork 
from his 28th. 
</P>
<P>
 Mozart was just cutting his teeth on the piano-concerto form when he set the 
three concertos of K. 107 down on paper, actually just "primitive" (the word is 
Alfred Einstein's) reworkings of sonatas by J.C. Bach. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed entirely appropriate -- or at least effective -- for music director 
Micah Levy to have 6-year-old Nomi Abadi on hand (with seat cushion and pedal 
extension) to play the third of these simple concertos, and she dispatched it 
capably. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 9-year-old brother, Arthur, followed with the Rondo, K. 382 -- a piece 
that represents "the first instance of Mozart having to write down to the taste 
of the Vienna public" (Einstein again) -- and Mozart's first independent piano 
concerto, No. 5, K. 175. 
</P>
<P>
 Mozart wrote both works as virtuoso vehicles for himself, and Arthur Abadi was 
very much up to their demands. The basic accompaniments were basically 
adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first half of the concert coupled mature performer with mature work, with 
William Wolfram -- bronze medalist in a recent International Tchaikovsky 
Competition, winner of the William Kapell -- playing the Piano Concerto in G, 
K. 453. Wolfram proved a model Mozartean, glowing and singing in melody, 
vibrant in rhythm and knowing in inflection of the dramatic line. 
</P>
<P>
 He kept his interpretation small-scale, nicely gauged to the tiny forces at 
Levy's command (a violin section of six), which, despite sounding thin at 
times, turned in a polished and spirited accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert opened out of left field, with unprogrammed Liszt encores first , 
fluent, resplendent readings by Wolfram of the "Sonetto del Petrarca," No. 104, 
and the Second Hungarian Rhapsody.

MUSIC REVIEWS; CAMERATA ENDS SEASON WITH ENERGY TO SPARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mozart Camerata closed its season with polished performances brimming with 
verve Sunday afternoon at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Music director Ami Porat lent center stage to Misha Lefkowitz for the entire 
first half of the concert.However, the programming did not signal a retreat by 
the orchestra, which partnered the violinist as a responsive equal -- lilting 
and tidy during Dvorak's Romance in F minor, Opus 11 (incorrectly identified in 
the program as "Romance in F"), well-balanced and sympathetic during works by 
Saint-Saens/Ysaye and Pablo Sarasate. 
</P>
<P>
 As the featured soloist, Lefkowitz, a longtime member of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, brought an unpretentious reliability to bear. Not one to permit 
himself excessive liberties in pacing, he approached the Romance with a 
straightforward, leisurely quality, imparted gentle humor to Ysaye's virtuosic 
"Caprice d'apres l'Etude en forme de valse" -- a fluffy elaboration of 
Saint-Saens' Etude in waltz form, from his Opus 52 set -- and dispatched 
Sarasate's Introduction and Tarantella, Opus 43, with authority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The major offering of the evening was Bizet's Symphony in C, written in 1855 
when the composer was only 17. Porat commanded an exuberant reading, concise, 
playful and robust, with few technical inconsistencies. Principal oboist Leanne 
Becknell luxuriated in the long cantilena of the Adagio, during which she 
received attentive echoes from within the woodwind section.

 "The Who's Tommy" grossed $928,103 -- 99.62% of capacity -- for eight 
performances May 10 through 15 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in 
Costa Mesa. Although the show didn't set a house attendance record ("Les 
Miserables" and "Grease" have done better), the gross for "Tommy" was the 
highest one-week total of the show's national tour so far, according to a 
center spokesman.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; STRAIT MAKES GOOD ON HIS PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NOEL DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why has George Strait remained at the top of country music for more than a 
dozen years, when so many others have come and gone? 
</P>
<P>
 In his 90-minute show at the Pond in Anaheim on Sunday, Strait answered that 
question with his good, solid country music, astute song selection and, more 
than anything else, by the fact that he was there at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The date was a makeup of Strait's April 29 concert at the Pond, which he 
canceled after nine songs because a bad cold was affecting his voice. How many 
performers would have croaked out a few more songs, grabbed the money and run? 
</P>
<P>
 Strait, however, was determined to give his fans their money's worth. Backed 
by his excellent eight-piece Ace in the Hole Band, Strait delivered on his 
promise with a 24-song set that combined his hits with the Western swing music 
that is the foundation of his traditional style. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strait played many of his biggest hits, including "The Chair," "Ocean Front 
Property" and "Amarillo by Morning," but he kept the set from being too 
predictable by also including several of the non-hits from his two latest 
albums, "Pure Country" and "Easy Come, Easy Go." 
</P>
<P>
 Strait and his band kicked into high gear with tributes to his biggest 
influences -- Merle Haggard and Bob Wills. Strait dug out a great obscure 
Haggard ballad, 1974's "(Seahorses of) Old Mexico," and let his musicians show 
their chops on three of Wills' Western-swing classics -- "Milk Cow Blues," "Big 
Ball's in Cowtown" and "That's What I Like About the South." 
</P>
<P>
 Working on a stage in the center of the arena, Strait changed mikes so that he 
faced a different part of the crowd on each song. The fact that his back was 
turned to the audience half the time drained the set of some of its momentum.

THEATER REVIEW; 'QUILTERS': WARMTH IN THE WILDERNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An actress once commented that playing one of the pioneer women in Molly 
Newman and Barbara Damashek's musical drama "Quilters" is far more difficult 
than playing, say, one of Shakespeare's court women. With Shakespeare, she 
explained, at least there's a theatrical tradition to fall back on. What do you 
have with pioneer women, except mostly bad movie stereotypes? 
</P>
<P>
 With the retreat of America's wilderness and folk traditions, the struggles 
and dreams of the hardy women who went West now seem at least as remote as 
Henry IV's court. Willing "Quilters" to life on stage comes down to pure 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 The imaginings at Cal State Fullerton's Recital Hall, in director Joseph 
Arnold's staging, are as fully realized as any "Quilters" this reviewer has 
seen, including the edition staged by GroveShakespeare. The play's built-in 
problems aren't overcome, but this group has put its signature firmly on this 
dramatic quilt of story, song and memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer matriarch Sarah (Laura Lossing) passes life's lessons on to her six 
daughters through quilting, a still-vital art of mixing and matching 
multicolored fabrics into a domestic kaleidoscope to keep warm by. This is no 
linear family tale: The actors playing the daughters must spin out and become a 
whole variety of women (and sometimes men) on the range and in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 And , while doing all this, they must sing in complex harmonies, often a 
cappella. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble under Sarah's tutelage -- Shauna Daigle, Theresa Finamore, Wendy 
Ham, Erin M. McNally, Dana Meller and Sarah ramsey-Duke -- seems to find none 
of this daunting. Indeed, the performers seem to relish the pleasures and pains 
of the quilters, immersing themselves completely in the distant time and place. 
This "Quilters" is the real deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Or as real as the play allows. No amount of stirring performances, for 
instance, can eliminate the sense midway through Act II of an overly long book. 
Beyond that, the very core of "Quilters"' popularity -- its deliberate mixing 
of homespun feminism and old-time nostalgia, and its shifting from Currier and 
Ives-like sentimentality to Walker Evans-like harshness -- ultimately seems too 
calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hearts and voices of these actresses burst the difficult dramaturgical 
wall with uncommon passion. This production affords a rare chance for serious 
female college drama students to work together, and their joy is palpable. 
Though the unit is fairly seamless (good, tight threads are important in both 
quilting and ensemble theater), McNally sings a little above the rest, 
especially her splendid "Butterfly Song." 
</P>
<P>
 Lossing may smile a tad too often as she builds her family history quilt by 
quilt, but she carries herself with a rough assuredness that is passed on to 
the others. Whether as children huddled in mom's bed during the nighttime 
creaking of their log cabin home, or as women bearing more babies than their 
bodies will allow, or particularly as a chorus realizing every nuance of 
Damashek's rich, unpredictable score, this cast has learned the meaning of 
ensemble work. 
</P>
<P>
 Lara Hanneman's set combines a proscenium arch in the form of a spinning wheel 
with an epic backdrop of hanging white sheets (a wall of laundry?) and a 
wood-planked platform stage that is very helpful to the show's direct-address 
narrative. E. Junior Usaraga's lights often make the set and the women 
sculptural, while Juan Lopez's costumes make their own tapestry of fabric. We 
can wish that music director Chuck Estes' trio were live rather than taped, but 
it delivers a warm sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Warmth, after all, is what the beautiful old quilts delivered, and warmth is 
what we get from from this fine, subtle production. 
</P>

 Gilbert Roland, the lithe, muscular star whose career spanned seven decades

has died. He was 88.

 Roland died Sunday of cancer at his Beverly Hills home, longtime friend Scott 
Harrison said Monday.

 Assuming the dashing Cisco role from Duncan Renaldo after World War II, Roland 
starred in half of the 23 sound features about the colorful Mexican Robin Hood. 
</P>
<P>
 (The durable Cisco Kid character, taken from a 1904 O. Henry short story 
titled "The Caballero's Way," was also played through silents, talkies, radio 
and television by Warner Baxter, Cesar Romero, Renaldo and this year by Jimmy 
Smits.) 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his affability, Roland was never agreeable about racial prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Cisco Kid might have been a bandit, but he fought for the poor and was a 
civilized man in the true sense of the word," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the time he added a scene showing Cisco reading Shakespeare, 
Roland told The Times: "I wanted to be sure the Mexicano was not portrayed as 
an unwashed, uneducated, savage clown." 
</P>
<P>
 Roland made more than 100 films in roles ranging from shady saloon characters 
to romantic leads to the heroic Cisco.  
</P>
<P>
 He won his greatest critical praise for his role as a matador in "The 
Bullfighter and the Lady " in 1951. It was the only one of his films ever 
nominated for an Academy Award -- for the screenplay, but it did not win. 
</P>
<P>
 Roland was literally born to play a matador. His father had been a bullfighter 
in Spain and taught his family the traditions and the skills of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 During the filming of the silent "Blood and Sand," the young Roland, with his 
knowledge of bullfighting, was hired to help dress Rudolf Valentino as a 
classic matador. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Luis Antonio Damaso de Alonso in Chihuahua, Mexico, Roland was the second 
of six children of Don Francisco and Consuelo Alonso. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican Revolutionary War forced the family to flee to Juarez when he was 
6. However, when Pancho Villa's army captured the border city that year, the 
Alonsos fled across the Rio Grande and settled in El Paso, where Roland learned 
to speak English and saw his first motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
 He was so captivated by the movies, he later said, that he jumped on a train 
and headed for Hollywood at the age of 13. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Roland worked at different jobs, unloading ships on Catalina Island 
and unloading newspapers for Los Angeles Times dealers. The aspiring actor took 
any job to survive. But whenever there was a chance to get a part as a film 
extra, he left his job to race to the studios. 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared as an anonymous player in some early silent classics, beginning 
with "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" in 1923 with Lon Chaney. Roland earned $3 
and a box lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1925, the best Roland could do was the second lead in "The Plastic Age." 
The dapper star with what became known as the "Gilbert Roland profile" often 
watched the film in his later years at the Silent Movie on Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Roland was ready to give it all up and travel to Spain to try bullfighting 
when Joseph M. Schenck of United Artists saw one of his films and cast him in 
the lead role of Armand Duval, opposite Schenck's wife, Norma Talmadge, in 
"Camille." 
</P>
<P>
 The young actor made one other appearance in silent films, in "The Woman 
Disputed," before becoming one of the few actors whose voice made him suitable 
for talkies. 
</P>
<P>
 His sound films included "New York Nights" in 1929, "She Done Him Wrong" in 
1933, "Thunder Trail" in 1937, and "The Sea Hawk" in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1941, Roland married film star Constance Bennett, but they divorced a few 
years later, some said because of the stardom she attained and he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 He served in Air Force intelligence during World War II, and after the war 
became the Cisco Kid of B movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Director John Huston cast him in 1949 in "When We Were Strangers," and after 
that, offers came more frequently. He starred in "The Furies" in 1950. Then in 
1951, he was cast in "The Bullfighter and the Lady," which proved his most 
memorable role. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked often in the next 30 years portraying peasants, ranchers, bandits, 
adventurers and circus performers. He also married for the second time, in 
1951, to Guillermina Cantu of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 His last movie appearance was in "Barbarosa" in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Roland gained admirers in the movie industry for his humility and 
graciousness, as well as for his abilities as a storyteller. He wrote 
prolifically and had many of his short stories published by Reader's Digest. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Guillermina, Roland is survived by two daughters from 
his first marriage, Lorinda and Gyl.

COMBATTING HATE; BIAS: CRIMES AGAINST MINORITIES ARE INCREASING ACROSS THE 
BOARD -- WITH GAYS NOW VICTIMIZED THE MOST. THE VAST MAJORITY OF INCIDENTS WILL 
GO UNPROSECUTED AS THE VIOLENCE EXTRACTS A HEAVY PERSONAL TOLL IN THE COUNTY.

 Michael Floyd thought it would never happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon after the 28-year-old gay man moved into a Van Nuys apartment complex 
in 1993, his life became a nightmare. It started when his building manager 
called him "fag" in front of other tenants. Someone scratched a huge "F" into 
his car. He found excrement smeared on his front door. One neighbor shoved him, 
and another threatened to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you doing this?" a shaken Floyd asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer came back loud and clear: Because he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd called the police seven times during 1993 but declined to file charges 
after the assault, mistakenly believing that the torment would stop. After 
other incidents, police told him it was tough to solve anonymous acts of 
vandalism and that they could not act on threats unless accompanied by an 
illegal act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt so helpless," recalled Floyd, who moved to West Hollywood in January 
because he feared for his life. "I thought: 'Do I have to get killed before the 
police will do something?' I'd heard about homophobia and harassment, but I 
never thought it would happen to me. I thought people would treat me as an 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd's case is not unique. Last week, Los Angeles County released its annual 
hate crimes report, which recorded 783 such crimes in 1993, a 6.4% jump over 
the previous year. For the first time since 1980, when the county began 
tracking, gay men supplanted African Americans as the primary target. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate crimes are increasing across the board -- and they are getting more 
violent. Although the stereotypical act of hatred may be a spray-painted 
swastika or scrawled racial epithet, almost one-third of hate crimes in 1993 
were assaults, 105 with deadly weapons, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority will go unprosecuted. According to the county Commission on 
Human Relations, only 12 hate crimes came to trial last year. Trials in two 
more cases, in which people were killed, are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd's case illustrates the difficulty that victims and law enforcement 
agencies face in recognizing and prosecuting such crimes. Los Angeles Police 
Department officials will not comment on how many hate crimes lead to arrests, 
and the district attorney's office cannot break out hate crimes on its 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We struggle with overwhelming odds at every level," said Kay Shafer, the hate 
crimes coordinator for the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Many victims -- including Floyd -- say they did not know there was a law 
against hate crimes. Others are not sure what qualifies as a hate crime. The 
Human Relations Commission says leaning out of a car window and calling someone 
a racially charged name would not qualify. Spray-painting a swastika on a 
synagogue would. Obscene or threatening phone calls that contain racial, 
ethnic, religious, homophobic or sexist slurs are hate crimes. But a fight 
between a white man and a black man would not be logged as a hate crime unless 
racial epithets were exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups monitor the figures closely. A spokesman for the American 
Jewish Committee noted that Jews are victims in disproportionate numbers -- 
they constitute only 5% of the Los Angeles County population but account for 
89.5% of all religious hate crimes. Frank Berry, a spokesman for the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said gays may have a higher 
profile this year but that the number of hate crimes against African Americans 
is still alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Robert Lee Johnson, who is African American. Johnson said he and his 
family were the target of a Latino street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It started with racial taunts. His daughters were assaulted on the way to the 
market. In February, Johnson was shot as he watched TV in his living room. Two 
weeks later, someone threw a pipe bomb into his rented Norwalk home, which 
burned down. The family, which included children and grandchildren, lost 
everything they had. Now living in Compton, Johnson is trying to put the trauma 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, "We deal with it every day. It's always there. It will 
probably always be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is frustrated by the limits of the system. Initially, he said, the 
Sheriff's Department "did a lot of hesitating. When we called, it was like 'No 
one's hurt.' They got offended when my son told them it was a Latino gang. They 
said, 'How did you know it was a Mexican? What was the motive?' Suspicion's 
being turned on me. We haven't committed any crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanon Hodges, a gay African American, recalls the difficulty he had 
persuading police that he was the victim of a hate crime in 1989. Hodges had 
gone to see about renting a Silver Lake apartment and was walking down the 
street about 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Three white skinheads between the ages of 17 and 19 approached, and Hodges, 
who sensed trouble, began to run. One youth yelled, "Nigger faggot, I'm going 
to kill you," Hodges said, and stabbed him in the back with a jagged six-inch 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges staggered down the street and fell into the first open door. It was a 
gay bar, whose manager called police and an ambulance. When police arrived, 
Hodges said, they pulled on his earrings, called him names and told him the 
attack was his fault. Hodges said he spent eight hours at County-USC Medical 
Center waiting to be treated. The assailants were never caught. 
</P>
<P>
 An LAPD spokesman declined to comment on the case, saying that "if conduct 
like that (by the officers) happened, it's inappropriate, and we have a process 
for dealing with that, if (Hodges) wants to file a complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges' scars -- both physical and emotional -- remain five years later. He 
dropped out of art school. He became estranged from friends. He broke off with 
his lover because, he said, he felt ugly. He tried counseling, but it did not 
help. He tried drawing, but the pictures were so angry, he tore them up. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the attack on Hodges, many hate crimes occur at night. Assailants use 
a hit-and-run approach that leaves few clues. Victims, whether gays in the 
closet, African Americans disaffected with law enforcement or immigrants 
fearing deportation, often do not call the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants' rights groups say their clients can be deported if they report a 
hate crime and an investigation shows that they are here illegally. Some argue 
that California needs to amend its laws so that victims cannot be deported or 
kicked out of the military for reporting hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when victims step forward, community activists say, police do not always 
log the incident as a hate crime -- a charge the police deny. And if arrests 
are made and charges filed, the district attorney must prove that the defendant 
committed the crime and that it was motivated by hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are among the most underreported and underprosecuted crimes around," 
said Brian Levin, a visiting scholar at Stanford Law School, who is legal 
director for the Center for the Study of Ethnic and Racial Violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even county statistics are incomplete because only nine of about 40 law 
enforcement agencies provided data. West Covina logged 12 hate crimes last year 
that were not included in the countywide total of 783. West Covina police crime 
analyst Anne Gray said the county never requested information on hate crimes; 
the county said it contacts each agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Shafer, of the district attorney's office, said that thanks to massive media 
attention and education programs by community groups and law enforcement, 
awareness about hate crime is growing. But she likens it to the status of 
domestic violence and sexual assaults 10 or 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin estimates that half of all hate crimes still go unreported; in the gay 
community, he believes, the figure may be as high as 90%. Only about 1% are 
prosecuted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting the line officer, who is the most cynical and least trained, to 
understand what constitutes a hate crime is very difficult," said Levin, a 
former police officer who now runs hate crime training programs for various 
police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. John White, the LAPD's hate crime coordinator, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people go around bashing the police, but I don't think there's a 
police department in the country that has a system as efficient as us for 
handling hate crimes," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each LAPD division has a hate crimes coordinator, White said. All rookies 
study the issue at the police academy and receive in-service training, 
including periodic memos from White. When a hate crime report is filed, 
follow-up calls are made to the victim's home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to find a nexus, a connection between the crime and the person . . . 
but often there's not enough evidence. If the suspect didn't say anything 
(racist or homophobic), it's hard to classify it as a hate crime," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate crimes are up, experts say, because Americans seek scapegoats for their 
declining living standards. Hate crimes between minority groups are rising as 
well as crimes against whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get this fear and frustration, people revert back to their in-group 
and want to find a target for their anger," Levin said. "We still harbor 
stereotypes, and they're the trigger that someone who is sick or angry or 
frustrated can beat up on." 
</P>
<P>
 Society also suffers because hate crimes breed fear and distrust among groups, 
dividing people into either victims or perpetrators, Levin said. Hate groups 
recognize the fragility of the inter-group bond and how easy it is to disrupt. 
They know a burglary will not cause a riot but hope that a hate crime might. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most perpetrators are not members of organized groups. About 85% are male, 
in their early or mid-teens, and lead a marginal existence, said Jack Levin, a 
professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University, who co-wrote 
"Hate Crimes, the Rising Tide of Bigotry and Bloodshed." 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years ago they might have stolen hubcaps; now they beat people up," 
Levin said. "They are unremarkable types, the kids down the block. Very few 
wear sheets or armbands or hoods." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy next door was exactly who terrorized John Ruiz and his family in 
Arleta for two years. Paul M. Downing, who mistakenly believed that Ruiz was 
Jewish, spray-painted anti-Semitic graffiti and swastikas on the walls, set 
fires in their home and fired shots into the window. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz, a Catholic of Spanish ancestry, said he had "a great deal of difficulty" 
in getting police interested. Detectives turned up nothing. Ruiz turned to the 
Anti-Defamation League, who persuaded the FBI to pursue it as a civil rights 
violation. Downing pleaded guilty to eight felonies and was sentenced to 10 
years in prison in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the fight left profound scars. After spending $20,000 on fire repairs, 
Ruiz sold his home of 15 years, where he had hoped to retire. He lost his job 
as a national sales manager because he was afraid to leave his family to go on 
business trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Ruiz lives in a security building, in a place he will not reveal. He no 
longer registers to vote because he fears that Downing could obtain his 
address. He and his wife flinch each time a motorcycle passes because the 
hatemonger once harassed them from his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been such a trauma in our lives that we just can't shake it," Ruiz 
said "I am an Everyman. I believe in live and let live. I love my country. And 
it's horrifying to me that this can be happening in America. But you can't let 
something like this consume your sanity because then he won. To a degree he won 
anyway. This will always be with us." Compiling Hate Criminal threats and 
assaults were the most prevalent forms of hate crime reported in Los Angeles 
County in 1993, according to an annual study of hate crimes in the region. Here

JUDGE TURNS DOWN GIRL'S BID TO DISPLAY CONDOMS AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 An eighth-grade girl, who was prohibited from wearing condom packages on her 
clothes to promote safe sex, lost her fight Monday to resume the campus 
campaign after a federal judge ruled that principals "must be given great 
latitude to govern schools attended by children." 
</P>
<P>
 Astrianna Johnson, 14, a student at Mary McLeod Bethune Middle School in 
South-Central Los Angeles, pinned colored condoms in clear packages to her 
shoes, pants and blouse three times last fall. She sued the district, accusing 
it of violating her free speech rights after her principal said her behavior 
was inappropriate for middle school students and could disrupt the school. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ruling that school officials praised for its broader applications on 
issues such as student dress codes, U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr. said 
that it is in society's interest to place greater restrictions on pre-high 
school students when it comes to teaching the boundaries of socially acceptable 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Educators -- not children -- should be given the right to choose which values 
to emphasize and the means by which those values will be instilled in their 
students," Hatter wrote. "The 1st Amendment does not require school boards to 
surrender control of the American public school system to public school 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 Astrianna, who had hoped to pin condoms to her middle school graduation gown 
next month, said she "felt like I was stripped of my rights," but will continue 
her condom crusade when she is off-campus. She decided to make the statement 
last fall, concerned about friends who had gotten pregnant and the spread of 
the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned I have no rights when I am at school," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Amos D. Dyson III of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he 
has not decided whether to appeal the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter ruled that Bethune Principal Edith H. Morris, who has been an educator 
for 30 years, "is better qualified than the court" to decide what kinds of 
actions will provoke pre-adolescent boys and girls to cause classroom 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris also believed that Astrianna's condom-wearing could be interpreted as 
encouraging sexual promiscuity among students or could endanger Astrianna 
because the condoms could be viewed as an invitation for sex.

SUSPECT REFUSES TO TESTIFY FOR GRAND JURY; INQUIRY: NICHOLAS A. DUREPO DECLINES 
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS DURING FIVE-MINUTE APPEARANCE IN ARSON CASE. DOZENS OF 
FIREFIGHTERS LEND SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One of two firefighters named as suspected arsonists in last fall's deadly 
Calabasas/Malibu fire and a friend with whom he had spoken a few hours after 
the blaze started appeared before the Los Angeles County Grand Jury on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas A. Durepo spent about five minutes before the grand jury, declining 
to answer any questions on the advice of his lawyer. Durepo, 24, and Steven R. 
Shelp, 29, have been identified by Sheriff's Department investigators as 
suspects in the Nov. 2 blaze that killed three people, destroyed 350 homes and 
caused more than $375 million in damage before it was brought under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Durepo, Shelp and at least four witnesses were spirited out a back door at the 
end of the grand jury proceeding to avoid reporters waiting in a hallway of the 
county Criminal Courts Building. Shelp attended the session to lend support to 
Durepo, according to friends, and is scheduled to go before the grand jury 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators have said the two men -- volunteer firefighters at the 
time -- started the fire so they could put it out with a garden hose and be 
rewarded with firefighting jobs. The men have not been arrested or charged in 
connection with the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months after the blaze, Shelp became a firefighter with the Los Angeles 
Fire Department, although he has been placed on administrative duty until the 
investigation is completed. Durepo has been taken off active volunteer duty 
with the Manhattan Beach Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men have maintained their innocence, contending that they happened upon 
the fire and made a vain attempt to put it out with the help of a "plumber" who 
happened to drive by. Although both have remained silent, a lawyer for Durepo 
said Monday that his client and Shelp are victims of an overzealous and sloppy 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities "are still conducting their hearings, but hopefully this thing is 
going to terminate pretty quickly," said the lawyer, Donald J. Calabria. 
"Really, I don't know why they are even going further, but I don't know what 
evidence that they have. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is so bothersome is that they are trying to find someone who started a 
fire when they are not even sure that someone started a fire," Calabria said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabria said his client and Shelp provided authorities with information about 
the mysterious plumber -- who turned out to be an underground contractor -- 
including what he was wearing. But the attorney said homicide investigators 
concluded their investigation without finding and interviewing the man. 
Finally, Robert Blakeley came forward last week after his photograph was 
published in The Times and corroborated parts of the firefighters' story. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Sally Thomas had no comment on the investigation or the 
grand jury proceedings. Authorities have said the two failed lie detector 
tests, provided questionable accounts of their whereabouts on the day of the 
fire and offered other statements considered dubious, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Durepo's friend, Scott Safechuck, testified before the grand jury Monday about 
discussions he had with Durepo the evening after the fire broke out. Safechuck 
left the proceeding without talking to reporters. But his father, Frank 
Safechuck, contended that his son has filed a complaint against a sheriff's 
investigator who harassed him for corroborating part of Durepo's story. The 
Sheriff's Department refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Several dozen firefighters who said they know Shelp and Durepo also showed up 
to lend support. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Jackson King of the La Habra Heights Fire Department said the two men 
worked for him while they were volunteers several years ago. "When you eat next 
to somebody and work with them for two years, you know them," he said. "They 
are straight-up guys, honest and sincere. We believe in them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mount, Durepo's training officer at the South Bay Fire Academy, said he 
supports his friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe him," Mount said. "I believe when the truth surfaces, there'll be 
some embarrassed people."

COUNTY BUDGET TARGETS SHERIFF, PARKS, LIBRARIES

 Built on wobbly assumptions and facing an uncertain reception at the Board of 
Supervisors, the Los Angeles County budget for the coming year was unveiled 
Monday, revealing a spending plan that its authors said "dictates austerity 
despite extraordinary levels of unmet needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed $14.2-billion budget recommends lopping $60 million from the 
Sheriff's Department, laying off 1,100 workers and closing many libraries, 
parks and museums. Still, county Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed said 
the plan "is likely the best-case scenario" that will almost certainly worsen 
before a budget is adopted by the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said her budget includes some uncertain funding sources that may not 
materialize. She said the board asked her to be creative in drawing up the 
1994-95 spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe (this budget) is creative. Scary, but creative," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors said Reed's proposal is only a starting point for their 
deliberations, and Monday there were both kudos and catcalls for her 
three-volume, six-inch-thick budget proposal. Most supervisors agreed that the 
Sheriff's Department should receive more money, but there was no consensus as 
to how much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke termed Reed's budget proposal fair, 
but also indicated that individual budget items were likely to undergo 
significant overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a long time between the proposed budget and the final adopted budget 
and in that time we are going to make sure that everyone gets a fair deal," 
Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich blasted the proposal because of cuts to the sheriff 
and probation departments and the district attorney's office. Antonovich said 
voters approved the Proposition 172 sales tax surcharge last year to guarantee 
increased funding for law enforcement, but that the funds are being siphoned 
off for health and other county uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina, who has often complained that the sheriff received 
an inordinate share of the county's resources, said these cuts went too far. 
She said the board should try to restore part of his budget by consolidating 
various departments and implementing other measures.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block said he planned to immediately begin lobbying 
supervisors in an attempt to plug his budget gap. He said he wants at least an 
additional $60 million just to maintain the current level of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the budget's grim pall of increasing needs amid stagnant resources 
shone a couple of unusual bright spots: Health, mental health and welfare 
programs were fully funded or suffered minor cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Also faring relatively well were the Municipal and Superior courts, public 
defender, coroner and Consumer Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides law enforcement and cultural and recreational programs, the largest 
cuts landed on basic governmental services, including the assessor, 
registrar-recorder and tax collector. 
</P>
<P>
 She also recommended cuts in funding and personnel for her office and those of 
the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reed warned that the resources necessary to support even this lean budget 
may not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago, she projected a county deficit of $900 million and 
recommended drastic cuts to close the breach. But the board was unhappy with 
Reed's calculations and ordered her to identify new sources of revenue. She 
pared the deficit estimate to $184 million by including some questionable 
revenue sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said Gov. Pete Wilson and state legislators could take more of the 
county's tax revenues or foist more costly state responsibilities on local 
governments to balance their own budget. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also unclear if the state will agree to drop restrictions it placed on 
the use of tobacco tax money and other health care programs. That could cost 
the county tens of millions of dollars that Reed factored into her budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The county could also lose an additional $93 million in a squabble with the 
state over how to calculate the split in property tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the most speculative revenue item in Reed's budget proposal is $150 
million drawn from the county employees retirement system. Reed said she hopes 
an actuarial study will show that the money can be transferred without 
jeopardizing the soundness of the pension fund. But officials at the Los 
Angeles County Employees Retirement Assn. have told some supervisors they will 
not release the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this uncertain background, the various county departments will be 
jockeying for more money as the board opens public hearings June 1, and any 
department could be pared further. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Reed's proposal the county's recreational and cultural programs will be 
especially hard hit: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cuts in the parks department would result in the closure of eight swimming 
pools and 37 parks. Maintenance and repairs at the remaining 79 parks would be 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fifty-one of 87 public libraries would be closed and 211 jobs eliminated. 
This comes on top of severe cuts last year that resulted in closing 10 
libraries and sharply reducing operating hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Museum of Natural History is slated to lose $2.4 million, forcing 
suspension of education, research and outreach activities, including school 
tours. Exposition Park and the George C. Page Museum would be open only on the 
weekends and the museum would no longer be able t accept national and 
international exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Even departments that are being fully funded are having to make some 
adjustments to live within their budgets. Reed is recommending that the health 
department close seven of 45 health centers. Comparison Spending 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors directly control only $2.7 billion of the county's 
$14.2-billion budget. The remainder must be spent on programs mandated by the 
state and federal governments. Here is how the spending controlled by the board 
compares to last fiscal year, according to the budget proposed Monday.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SUSPECT 
ARRESTED IN FATAL CARJACKING; 2ND SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspect has been arrested in the carjacking murder of a father of three in 
Willowbrook, and the victim's classic lowrider car has been recovered, Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives responding to an anonymous tip arrested Leland Chambers, 31, as he 
attempted to drive the stolen 1970 Chevrolet Impala convertible away from an 
apartment building in Lynwood, Deputy Gabriel Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said detectives had gotten a telephone call a few minutes earlier that 
the meticulously customized car, covered with blankets, was parked behind the 
apartment building in the 3300 block of Carlin Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they were looking for a second suspect in the slaying of 
Terrance Booker, 26, of Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 Booker -- a pharmacy employee with children ages 4, 6 and 8 -- was accosted by 
two men after he delivered groceries to a friend in an apartment on El Segundo 
Boulevard shortly after 10 a.m. Sunday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said that although Booker apparently did nothing to stop the men 
from taking the car, one of them suddenly opened fire. Hit once in the upper 
body, Booker tried to run, making it almost all the way across the broad 
boulevard before he collapsed on the pavement and died. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said one of the assailants drove off in Booker's car and the other 
followed in a blue sports coupe.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MTA TO 
BEGIN LAYING OFF 117 WORKERS THIS MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will begin laying off 117 employees 
later this month to help overcome a projected $300-million budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs are part of a plan announced in March to eliminate 269 positions 
and scale back some projects to trim $100 million from a massive operating and 
capital shortfall forecast for the fiscal year beginning in July. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal memo issued Friday said 117 employees will lose their jobs, most 
of them union workers in the operations unit, including service attendants and 
clerks. MTA officials Monday began the process of notifying those affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-seven administrative employees will be let go, including several from 
the agency's planning and programming unit, which maps out the MTA's transit 
projects. The remainder of the 269 positions have remained vacant since a 
hiring freeze was imposed at the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin E. White, chief executive officer of the MTA, said the cuts are 
necessary for the agency to balance its $3.4-billion budget.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 3 PLEAD 
NOT GUILTY IN ILLEGAL GAMBLING ON RESERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two consultants and a gaming business president pleaded not guilty in Los 
Angeles on Monday to federal charges that they set up 140 illegal slot machines 
that took in $10 million on the Morongo Indian Reservation.  
</P>
<P>
 The men and E. C. Investments Inc. are accused of installing illegal video 
Keno, poker and "Pot-o-Gold" machines in Casino Morongo, a gaming business on 
the Morongo Reservation near Banning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morongo Tribal Council hired the men and the company to run the casino, 
according to a 23-count grand jury indictment returned last week.  
</P>
<P>
 ECI President Ira Englander, 66, of Los Angeles, and consultants Roger Keesee 
43, of Atlanta, and William C. Armstrong, 41, of Pompano Beach, Fla., pleaded 
not guilty to the charges. Englander also entered a not guilty plea on behalf 
of the corporation.  
</P>
<P>
 The defendants, free on $250,000 bond, face at least 20 years in prison if 
convicted.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an arrest warrant was issued for Gyorgy Hargitai, 46, who owns the 
company and lives in Budapest. U.S. Magistrate Judge Volney Brown set trial for 
June 28 before U.S. District Judge Richard Gadbois.

OFFICER ARRESTED IN FREEWAY SHOOTINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Police Department officer who, while off-duty, allegedly fired 
shots at two cars on Interstate 10 in Colton was held on $50,000 bail Monday in 
San Bernardino County.  
</P>
<P>
 Officer Robert Cardona, 35, of the Rampart Division, allegedly fired several 
shots from a 9-millimeter handgun Sunday night at the cars exiting the freeway, 
prompting back-to-back 911 calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was hit in either incident, officials said. They said the second 
motorist went to a service station to call authorities and provided a 
description of a man walking out of the shadows and toward the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies who showed up a few moments later took a man, matching the 
description phoned in by the civilian, into custody and found a 9-millimeter 
handgun on him. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers went back to where the shots were believed to have been fired and 
found 9-millimeter cartridges matching the ammunition in the suspect's weapon, 
authorities said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; WOMAN DENIES 
PLOTTING DEATHS OF HUSBAND, MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels denied in Van Nuys Superior Court on Monday that she hired 
a hit man to kill her husband, then another to kill the executioner. She also 
denied that she had openly searched for hired killers in bars. 
</P>
<P>
 But during her first full day of testifying in her own defense at her double 
murder-solicitation trial, Samuels admitted turning to a friend in a bar and 
complaining about her husband, whom she branded a child molester. She recalled 
saying that she wished he were dead. Then, she testified, a stranger approached 
her and said he knew where she could find a killer for hire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell off the bar stool," Samuels said. Then, she recalled, she giggled. 
</P>
<P>
 In her testimony, Samuels, 45, disputed the stories of nearly a dozen 
witnesses, some of whom testified under grants of immunity from prosecution for 
their roles in the deaths of Robert Samuels, 40, and James Bernstein, 27, the 
hit man suspected of arranging his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi is alleging that Samuels, who was divorcing her 
husband, had him killed so she could inherit his $500,000 estate.

COURTS FACE SICKOUT TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Superior Court system's 380 clerks and judicial 
assistants have voted to stage a sickout today to protest stalled contract 
talks with court administrators, union officials said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 While declining to predict how many clerks will not show up for work, J. 
Timothy Fives, a spokesman for Local 575 of the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees, said a number of courtrooms "will be dark" 
today because state law requires that a clerk be present when a judge presides. 
</P>
<P>
 Fives said that during such job actions, court administrators usually shift 
available clerks to fill crucial vacancies, especially in criminal courts, 
where cases must be heard within mandatory time limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The sickout could affect criminal, civil, juvenile, family law and probate 
courts in Downtown Los Angeles and other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying they were frustrated with what they saw as deliberate stalling by court 
administrators, the clerks and judicial assistants voted March 4 to authorize a 
strike or some other type of work action. The union members have worked without 
a contract for about two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fives said that pay is not the sole issue, although the clerks would like 
raises that bring them into line with court reporters and bailiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want is a contract and more respect," he said.

OUTLOOK DIM FOR 2 RIORDAN PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan will have trouble delivering on two of his 
campaign promises, after a City Council vote Monday preserving the full-time 
Board of Public Works and the council's threat to reduce funding for the Hope 
in Youth anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came on the first day of deliberations on Riordan's $4.3-billion 
spending package. Several more amendments are expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 In daylong voting Monday, the council did not tamper with Riordan's central 
new initiative -- hiring 450 more police officers. It voted to postpone the 
mayor's proposed consolidation of eight commissions and departments into two 
new super-agencies -- for economic development and community services. 
</P>
<P>
 That action was expected. But what had remained most in doubt before Monday 
was the fate of the Board of Public Works and the Hope in Youth program -- two 
ubiquitous issues during last year's mayoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan had promised to eliminate the board, saying it symbolized inflated 
bureaucracy and mayoral patronage. And regarding Hope in Youth, he told several 
cheering rallies that he would double funding to $5 million for what he said 
was a bold and innovative program to reduce gangsterism. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Monday's action is not final, it appears the council will not embrace 
either notion. 
</P>
<P>
 City lawmakers voted 10-5 to preserve the full-time Board of Public Works and 
restored to the budget more than $1 million to pay for the agency's operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's office did not adequately justify elimination of the board and 
left doubt about whether the public's ideas would be adequately heard through 
two part-time boards, several council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon called it "absolutely not true" that elimination of 
the board would save more than $1 million, saying the mayor's office had not 
calculated the cost of the extra bureaucrats needed to replace it.  
</P>
<P>
 Bill McCarley, the mayor's chief of staff, said Riordan is not fazed by the 
defeat. "I think a lot of people say they would like to eliminate the board, 
but they are not quite ready yet," McCarley said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Hope in Youth program, the council deferred final action until today. 
But a majority of council members appeared inclined to scrap the mayor's plan 
for doubling the project's funding from $2.5 million to $5 million. 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg offered an alternative proposal that would allow 
any organization to submit a proposal for a portion of the $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope in Youth was established a year ago with grants from the city, county and 
state. It is sponsored by 10 religious denominations and four community 
organizations that pledged to have 480 social workers counsel potential gang 
members, their families and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, led by Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, said the program has been 
given more money than any other anti-gang effort, even though it has no track 
record. City officials who have monitored Hope in Youth said they have received 
inadequate information to assure that the program is meeting its objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope in Youth organizers denied there are problems with the program, saying 
they are just getting started. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council also voted to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Alter Riordan's tax-cut proposal. Instead of businesses being the sole 
beneficiary, with the removal of a 7 1/2% surcharge on business taxes, the 
committee voted to cut the business surcharge in half and to reduce a 
residential refuse fee. The cut means homeowners would pay $54, a savings of 
$18, and renters would pay $36, a savings of $12. Business groups had opposed 
the change, saying the full 7 1/2% reduction is needed to promote economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase staffing at more than 35 recreation centers so doors can remain 
open 38 hours a week, instead of 25. A $4-million increase in funding for the 
Recreation and Parks Department also provides staffing for new parks and 
permits restroom cleaning seven days a week.  
</P>
<P>
 * Stave off cuts in library service by adding 37 employees. The added 
expenditure of $2.9 million will assure that there is staff for a homework 
program, literacy tutoring and research assistance, and for three new libraries 
in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue funding a nearly $1-million-a-year Los Angeles Visitors and 
Convention Bureau campaign overseas to promote travel to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce purchases of supplies by $10 million, after reports by Councilman 
Joel Wachs that the city has been paying more than retail prices for many 
items.

KING JURY ASKED TO HAVE OFFICERS PAY OUT MILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An attorney for Rodney G. King asked a jury in closing arguments Monday to 
bring an end to "an American saga" by ordering six present and former police 
officers to pay millions of dollars in punitive damages because of their roles 
in the King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 As King looked on in court, attorney John Burris asked the jury to award King 
between $3.8 million and $11 million. The minimum amount requested would equal 
the $3.8 million the same jury ordered the city to pay King during the first 
phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Burris also urged the jury not to be swayed by the defendants' claims that 
they are destitute and have been punished enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no redemption in these officers, no admission they did something 
wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we to reward them and have mercy on them?" Burris asked. "If they didn't 
care about the judicial system, why should we care about them? It is not enough 
to say, 'I'm losing my family and house and kids.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member panel appeared to be listening attentively as the attorneys 
made their closing arguments, which are scheduled to continue this morning 
before the case goes to the jury. Of the original 15 defendants, six remain: 
former Sgt. Stacey C. Koon; former Officers Laurence M. Powell, Timothy E. 
Wind, Theodore J. Briseno and current Officers Rolando Solano and Louis 
Turriaga.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the closing arguments began, Burris won a key point when U.S. District 
Judge John G. Davies reversed himself and ruled that King's lawyers could argue 
that a racial epithet was used during the beating and may indicate malice by 
Koon. 
</P>
<P>
 After King's side finished, attorneys for the officers made their final pitch 
to the jury, arguing that their clients had suffered enough and saying that 
King was ultimately responsible for the beating on March 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 As sergeant, Koon was the officer in charge at the scene and Powell delivered 
most of the baton blows against King. Both are serving 30-month federal prison 
terms for violating King's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. King chose to drive in an unsafe fashion. He chose to evade police," said 
attorney Ira Salzman, who represents Koon. "Mr. King made certain choices. He 
doesn't have a right to have those choices go unchallenged." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants have been "victimized as much as Rodney King," Salzman said, 
urging the jury not to get swept away by emotion in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should talk about the law, not vengeance, not a need to rub a man's nose 
in the dirt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much is enough?" Salzman asked. "He has $20 to his name, a career gone, 
sitting in an 8-by-7-foot cell. . . . Punishment? In the name of the law, what 
more should be done? Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Salzman placed the blame on city leaders who banned the chokehold in 1992, 
leaving officers with batons to handle unruly suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael Stone, who represents Powell, said the defendants were merely 
doing their jobs as police officers.  
</P>
<P>
 "These officers get paid to win, not lose," he said.

GAYS CALL ON UCLA TO DROP ROTC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Using newspaper advertisements and a statement signed by a host of politicians 
and entertainment figures, gay rights advocates are pressuring UCLA 
administrators to drop the campus ROTC programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although recruits to the Reserve Officers' Training Corps are no longer asked 
about their sexual orientation under new military regulations, openly gay 
cadets remain subject to discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have is an integral part of the university that has a 
no-gays-and-lesbians-need-apply sign," said David Mixner, who Monday released a 
"statement of conscience" signed by more than 2,000 local leaders in a variety 
of fields. "It shouldn't be a university-financed program since it violates 
their own policy on discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 Advertisements in today's editions of the UCLA campus paper, the Daily Bruin, 
and the West Coast edition of the New York Times urge the university to drop 
ROTC because it conflicts with university policy barring discrimination against 
gay men and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 UCLA students are enrolled in ROTC programs, which offer military 
training and scholarships to cadets in return for military service after 
graduation. The university provides ROTC with classroom and office space as 
well as secretarial services. 
</P>
<P>
 ROTC spokesmen had no comment except that they were bound by military policy. 
UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young's only response was to release a copy of a 
letter recently sent to the Department of Defense in which he urges the 
military to stop discriminating against gays. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mixner, those supporting the protest include several Los Angeles 
City Council members, county Supervisors Gloria Molina and Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke, state legislators and such entertainment industry figures as Whoopi 
Goldberg, Spike Lee, Steve Tisch, Alec Baldwin and Sharon Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to drive ROTC programs off college campuses because of the military's 
anti-gay policies have been under way for years. A small number of 
universities, including several Ivy League institutions, have dropped ROTC as a 
result.

FIVE PROPOSITIONS ON JUNE BALLOT PRESENT A MIXED BAG; TIMES URGES 'NO' VOTES ON 
PROPS. 175 AND 176; 'YES' ON 177, 178 AND 179 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Tuesday, June 7, Californians will be asked to vote on five statewide 
propositions. The Times makes the following recommendations on these measures. 
</P>
<P>
 PROPOSITION 175: NO. Since 1973, Californians who rent their principal 
residence have been able to gain a small measure of financial relief through 
the Renter's Income Tax Credit. For married couples, single parents and 
surviving spouses, it has meant that $120 could be deducted from their state 
income tax liability. For individuals, the figure was $60. The state's 
disastrous recession changed all that, causing the credit to be suspended until 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature and the governor now have -- and need -- flexibility in tough 
fiscal times. That is precisely what makes Proposition 175 a bad idea. It would 
embed the renter's tax credit in stone through a constitutional amendment, 
tying the hands of elected officials by placing yet another limit on dealing 
with future budget deficits. It would require a two-thirds vote of the people 
before the credit could be suspended, scaled back or eliminated in the future. 
That is neither prudent nor necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 PROPOSITION 176: NO. Similarly, Proposition 176 would amend the Constitution 
to exempt qualifying nonprofit organizations from locally imposed business 
license taxes or fees based on income or gross receipts. Nonprofit 
organizations in California already are exempt from state and federal taxes. 
Moreover, we have found no concrete examples of California cities or counties 
that have actually levied business taxes on nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we need to amend the Constitution to protect against a danger that does not 
appear to exist? We don't think so, and oppose Proposition 176.  
</P>
<P>
 PROPOSITION 177: YES. Anyone who has used a wheelchair or accompanied a 
wheelchair user can testify to the bitter frustration posed by businesses made 
unreachable by even a few stairsteps. The Americans With Disabilities Act of 
1990 was a giant step toward reducing these barriers; the federal law requires 
owners of commercial properties that are open to the public to make 
improvements to accommodate disabled individuals. Proposition 177 would give 
California business owners an important helping hand in complying.  
</P>
<P>
 Usually, when a property is improved, the property's valuation is increased by 
the amount of the improvement and property taxes go up accordingly. Proposition 
177 would amend the state Constitution to exempt any structural modifications 
to commercial facilities made after June 7, 1994, to improve access for and use 
by disabled people. It's unfortunate that it takes a constitutional amendment 
to facilitate these worthy improvements, but any modification of the 
Proposition 13 tax limitations that voters passed in 1978 requires a two-thirds 
popular vote. The exemption is also similar to tax breaks provided for public 
safety improvements such as sprinkler systems and disabled-access improvements 
to private homes. 
</P>
<P>
 This measure could eventually cost the state up to $10 million a year in lost 
tax revenues. However, this is revenue that would have been generated without 
Proposition 177, not a reduction in existing revenue. Moreover, the exemption 
expires upon the sale of a property; reappraisal would be at full market value. 
 
</P>
<P>
 PROPOSITION 178: YES. This measure is similar in purpose and operation to 
Proposition 177. California is now in the grip of yet another protracted water 
shortage. Proposition 178 would exempt new water conservation equipment 
installed on agricultural land from property tax reassessment until that land 
is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the state's largest farmers have already installed such 
equipment, smaller farmers have felt themselves too financially pinched to do 
so. Yet fostering water conservation is in the interest of every Californian. 
That's why we support this measure. 
</P>
<P>
 PROPOSITION 179: YES. Few in California will object if the minimum prison 
sentence for second-degree murder resulting from a "drive-by" shooting is 
raised from 15 to 20 years. Equally few honestly expect the number of these 
shootings to drop because of any such change in sentencing. (The maximum 
sentence was and will remain life in prison; parole was and will remain 
possible.) 
</P>
<P>
 More voters may find themselves asking, "Why are you coming to me about this?" 
The answer to that question points up again the folly of implanting measures 
that should be statutory law -- passed by and subject to revision by the 
Legislature -- in the Constitution, where revision requires a direct vote of 
the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the Briggs Amendment, passed by the voters in 1978, made restoration of 
the death penalty and other specified penalties a part of the state's 
Constitution. The Briggs changes could have been made by the Legislature. But 
because they were passed as a constitutional amendment, they can be changed 
only by further amendment. Thus we endorse Proposition 179.

CLIPPERS FIRE WEISS; COACH BLAMES SELFISH ATMOSPHERE; PRO BASKETBALL: HE SAYS 
CONTRACT SQUABBLES WERE A KEY FACTOR IN THE TEAM'S 27-55 RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Weiss, who coached the Clippers to the seventh-worst record in the NBA 
this season, was fired Monday with two years left on his $1.8-million, 
three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The move caught Weiss off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, who had met with General Manager Elgin Baylor and Executive Vice 
President Andy Roeser for four hours Friday, was making plans with his 
assistant coaches for next season's training camp when he was summoned Monday 
to what turned out to be a termination meeting with Baylor and Roeser. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss was the Clippers' seventh coach in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my most frustrating year ever as a coach," said Weiss, whose team 
finished 27-55. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, who succeeded Larry Brown last July, couldn't overcome the turmoil 
caused by the contract status of former Clipper forward Danny Manning and 
free-agent guard Ron Harper, and the loss of center Stanley Roberts, who 
suffered a ruptured Achilles' tendon 14 games into the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Weiss believe he got a fair shot in light of the circumstances? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to comment," Weiss said. "I think there's been enough Clipper 
bashing. I don't need to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 All season, however, the Clippers were torn by dissension. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never really had a teamwork approach," Weiss said. "Having your two top 
offensive players be unsigned just created a selfish atmosphere, and that's one 
of the things we discussed as a management team at the end of the year. That 
was the biggest factor, outside of the injuries, that we had that we could not 
overcome and it was a situation that we could not go in with again. We had to 
create a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor said the Clippers, who lost 17 of their last 21 games, had regressed 
under Weiss after making the playoffs for the last two seasons under Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby and I discussed (the circumstances) and we both agreed that we should 
have had a better record than we did this season," Baylor said. "We just felt 
that we were going backward and we want to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clipper defense, statistically the worst in the NBA last season, might 
have been Weiss' undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers gave up an average of 108.7 points. They gave up a record 71 
points to San Antonio center David Robinson in a season-ending 112-97 loss to 
the Spurs and Robinson edged Orlando Magic center Shaquille O'Neal for the 
league scoring title. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were reports the Clippers had decided to fire Weiss after a 
49-point loss at Seattle on April 14, club officials insist the decision wasn't 
made until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was pleased with the type of season that we had," Baylor said. 
"Winning is what it's all about. We started in that direction. There were 
difficult times this season, but we could have done things better ourselves to 
help. We recognize the fact that we need to do things better to make it work, 
and we'll make every effort to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who took 62 days to find a coach last year, hope to have another 
coach before the NBA draft on June 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got to get the best possible coach we can," Baylor said. "We're 
going to go out and talk to a lot of people. We'd like to have a coach by the 
draft, but we're not going to rush to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there was a report that the Clippers had contacted Brown, who has 
revitalized the Indiana Pacers, Brown and the Clippers denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a chance last year," Brown said. "I wanted to stay. But I haven't 
heard anything from them. The only thing I'm interested in is keeping this (the 
Pacers' drive to the NBA Eastern Conference finals) going." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are also said to be interested in San Antonio Coach John Lucas, 
under fire since the Spurs were eliminated by the Utah Jazz in the first round 
of the playoffs. The Clippers asked for permission to talk to Lucas last year 
but were turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers can't comment on Lucas because he is still under contract to the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers also contacted former New York Knick Coach Hubie Brown when they 
were searching for a coach last year and reportedly offered him a $1-million 
annual contract. Now a TV commentator, Brown is under contract to TNT. Clipper

MANNING READY FOR MARKET; AFTER PLAYOFFS, HE'LL HAWK WARES AS TOP FREE AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Danny Manning has moved out of the Brentwood home he was renting, has taken 
everything out of storage and has brought the wife and two kids down to Georgia 
for the final months of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 But he cannot really unpack. Sooner or later -- the sooner being as early as 
this week if the Atlanta Hawks are eliminated from the NBA playoffs and the 
later being mid-June if they rally and advance to the finals -- the family will 
return for the summer to the permanent digs in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Manning will conduct a Fourth of July weekend unlike anything this 
league has seen. Many of the 27 teams will be represented. It will be BYOM -- 
bring your own money. Green fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 No undesirables allowed, though. That means you, Donald Sterling and Andy 
Roeser of Exposition Park, and you, Larry Brown of Indianapolis. Likewise, 
teams facing anything resembling a two-year plan to reach .500 will not be 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who make the cut will not be there in person, of course. But they will 
be in phone calls and faxes and offers through agent Ron Grinker in their quest 
to sign the player who is, perhaps, the most attractive free agent in league 
history, a rush that will start July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who need the prototype power forward will go to Horace Grant. Those who 
want a two-time All-Star who today turns only 28, who is versatile enough to 
play power forward and small forward and who can score from every angle around 
the basket or handle the ball with uncommon skill for someone 6 feet 10 will 
call on Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be of some comfort to the seekers that Manning is already well tested 
on the subject of crazy days (see: Clipper career, November 1988-February 
1994). Consider his past: No. 1 draft choice. Contract holdout. The 
reconstructive knee surgery, the closely watched rehabilitation and the 
scrutiny that followed. The $25-million contract extension that almost 
materialized a year ago and could have made all of this a moot point. Larry 
Brown. Sterling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks, by contrast, have turned out to be almost everything he had hoped, 
primarily a respite. Given the big advantage of being able to disregard the 
salary cap to re-sign their own players, they might also become his permanent 
basketball team. Manning still says he is Atlanta's to lose. Not because of the 
money, but because of the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like everyone here is on the same page, moving in the same 
direction," he said. "Whereas in L.A., it wasn't like that all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of takes me back to the days when I was growing up, because it's a 
talented team and you just have to do your part. You have to go out and make 
sure you carry out your responsibilities out there. It's not, 'Well, I have to 
go out and score X amount of points for us to win.' I just have to go out and 
play. If I play defense, I can contribute on that end and I'm going to score 
points in the transition, but I don't have to score a whole lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fun for me, because every night I go out I try to see what our team 
needs and then try to give us that lift. In L.A., I felt I had to score for us 
to be competitive, and if I didn't score, I felt Ron (Harper) had to score and 
Mark (Jackson) had to score big points. One of us had to score big points for 
us to be somewhat successful. But here, I don't feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
 His numbers have changed as much as his role since he was traded for Dominique 
Wilkins, the most popular and greatest Hawk, and a No. 1 pick. Manning went 
from averaging 23.7 points with the Clippers to 15.7 while playing only about 2 
1/2 fewer minutes per game, an Atlanta scoring average that wouldn't have come 
close to beating out Kevin Willis for tops on the team had he been there all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 His shooting accuracy dropped from 49.3% to 47.6%. The only statistical area 
that increased was steals, in which he rose from a 1.26 average to 1.77, no 
surprise considering Atlanta's emphasis on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 As for being the go-to guy, as with the Clippers? Yes, that was Manning on the 
bench for most of the crucial final five minutes of his first Hawk playoff 
game, a 93-88 loss to Miami, when Duane Ferrell played instead. Heat players 
were nearly unanimous on how Wilkins would have been much more dangerous in 
that situation. 
</P>
<P>
 That might only be the start of such talk. The Hawks will almost certainly be 
put in a position to defend the trade if they don't climb out of the 3-1 hole 
against Indiana, especially after needing a fifth game to eliminate No. 8 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer vacation could begin as soon as tonight, and if it does, the strong 
Wilkins faction that remains around town will say the trade was why 1993-94, 
though filled with such lofty moments as tying the franchise record with 57 
victories and winning the first Eastern Conference regular-season title in team 
history, ultimately ended in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks have a counter argument: They were 18-7 with Manning in the lineup 
during the regular season, 72%, vs. 37-16, or 70%, before the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Nique is a nice guy," Hawk Coach Lenny Wilkens said. "He worked hard. Hey, 
but what did they win while he was here? Nothing. And they didn't show up in 
the stands, right? So what we did was in the best interest of the team, and it 
proved out. Our winning percentage went up, we got through the first round of 
the playoffs, here we are competing in this round. I say that there shouldn't 
be any question at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawk General Manager Pete Babcock said: "They're both free agents. We don't 
have the faintest idea whether we have a chance to sign Danny July 1 or not, 
not even a clue. We would have been in the same position we are anyway, which 
is why we made the deal. We thought we were no worse off and at least we have 
the experience with the 27-year-old for a few months and get a frame of 
reference for our own sake." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what happens, it was an aggressive move by the Hawks. They weren't 
on Manning's original short list and before the trade he wouldn't give 
management an indication of their chances to keep him as an unrestricted free 
agent, making the move an even greater gamble. They tampered with team 
chemistry and fan loyalty by trading Wilkins and could end up with nothing to 
show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks counted on Manning being impressed once he arrived, and he has been. 
He likes the coach. He likes last week's announcement that they are planning to 
pick a site within the next 90 days for a new 20,000-seat arena, though he 
remembers with a laugh being with another team that talked a lot about that for 
5 1/2 years and still hasn't put a shovel into the ground. The key factor now 
is mood. If the fallout from early elimination turns him into the fall guy, he 
concedes that could play a role in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fair to say," said Manning, who is doing his part by averaging 19.9 
and 6.4 rebounds during the playoffs. "There are a lot of things that are going 
to weigh in on the decision-making and factor in." 
</P>

JIM MURRAY: SHARMAN TO GET BALL AGAIN IN ANOTHER KEY SITUATION

 Bill Sharman with the basketball at the free-throw line was a sports work of 
art. Ruth with a fastball, Cobb with a base open. Dempsey with his man on the 
ropes. Hogan with a long par three. Jones with a short putt. Caruso with a high 
C. Hope in a "Road" movie. Shoemaker on the favorite. Sinatra with Gershwin.

 Before Sharman, a perfectly acceptable free-throw percentage was .700 or so. 
And those marks were made by the elite shooters of the game.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1956-57, he threw in a .905 percentage. Two years later, it was .932. Two 
years after that, it was .921.  
</P>
<P>
 In the playoffs one year, it was .966. Sharman made 57 of 59 free throws. He 
once threw in 56 in a row.  
</P>
<P>
 He was the first to sink an average of nine out of 10 free throws over a 
season. Bear in mind, this was a time when seven for 10 was All-Star stuff, a 
time when Wilt Chamberlain, for example, was deadlier from the floor than from 
the line. One year, Wilt shot .422 from the line and .649 from the floor, 
despite being double-teamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharman never shot worse than .800 from the line. One year, he missed only 18 
foul shots all season. You fouled him at your peril. 
</P>
<P>
 If that had been all he could do, his position would have been secure. But he 
was the first guard in the game to put up a field-goal percentage better than 
.400. His season marks included .456, .450 and .438. For the rest of the 
league, Billy Sharman with the basketball was like Billy the Kid with a gun.  
</P>
<P>
 He was one of the keys of the great Celtic teams of the 1950s and '60s. With 
Bob Cousy, he formed one of the top backcourt duos of all time and they might 
even have unwittingly set the tone for the modern distinction of "point" guard 
and "shooting" guard. Cousy ran the floor, Sharman ran the basket.  
</P>
<P>
 Cousy played the game of basketball at a high emotional pitch, but Sharman 
played the low-key, calculating game of the riverboat gambler. He had a 
reputation of never losing his cool. He was quick, sure-handed and slick enough 
to draw more than 3,000 fouls in a career in which he should have been the last 
person in the building anyone wanted to send to the line.  
</P>
<P>
 In point of fact, Sharman was kind of moonlighting as a basketball player. He 
really wanted to be a baseball player. The money was far better in those days. 
He was in the Dodger chain and showed great promise -- he batted .294 with 16 
home runs at St. Paul in the American Assn. -- but he was an outfielder and all 
he had to do was beat out Duke Snider, Carl Furillo, Andy Pafko and/or Jackie 
Robinson from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 As good as he was on court, Sharman was even more successful as a coach. He 
was coach of the year in three leagues. His style was the same as it had been 
on court -- competent but unobtrusive. When he had a Laker team that included 
Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Gail Goodrich, Sharman didn't spend 
much time at the blackboard. That team won 33 consecutive games and won once by 
69 points.  
</P>
<P>
 As skilled as he was and as hard as he worked, Sharman's career came to a 
close on an occupational hazard no one foresaw -- he lost his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 For a guy who shouted as little as he did -- Sharman's teams ran on their own 
adrenaline -- it was incomprehensible. But you can't run a team by notepaper 
and sign language. His mysterious malady, which only lately, 20 years later, is 
permitting him to communicate, ended his coaching career.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Lakers were loath to lose a man with Sharman's depth of experience. He 
served first as general manager, then as president and now is a special 
consultant.  
</P>
<P>
 What they additionally wanted was his luck. Some guys go through life with a 
cloud over their head. Sharman goes through with a halo over his. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider even his apparent ill fortune -- a place on a roster behind some of 
the great Dodger players of all time. It actually steered Sharman into the 
sport where he belonged, basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Boston Celtics, he arrived in the era when they were the New York 
Yankees of basketball. Bill Russell, the Jones boys (K.C. and Sam), Tom 
Heinsohn, Cousy, Jim Loscutoff, Satch Sanders. And Bill Sharman. He got used to 
winning right away.  
</P>
<P>
 So, the Lakers have a super-important assignment for their special consultant 
next week. They have found something their old coach also does well -- call a 
coin flip. Win a draft lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharman does everything well -- tennis might well have been his best sport. 
But he is uncanny at calling coin flips. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider 1979. He had to win a flip to decide whether the Lakers got Magic 
Johnson or Sidney Moncrief or somebody.  
</P>
<P>
 Sharman called heads. On reflection, that may have been the most important 
call in the history of the franchise. Try to imagine the Lakers without Magic 
Johnson. Showtime would have been in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 We dissolve a few seasons to another flip of the coin, the one that decides 
whether the Lakers get James Worthy or Fat Lever or somebody.  
</P>
<P>
 Sharman wins that toss, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers need Sharman next week when the NBA's drafting procedures call for 
extracting a lucky ball from a tub full of them in order to determine the order 
of selection.  
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Sharman is the guy you want with the ball.

NCAA BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; WEST LEFT OFF THE SITE MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The eight sites for the NCAA baseball playoffs were announced Monday and for 
the first time since the NCAA began the regional format in 1975 there will be 
no West regional. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional sites are Atlantic I at Miami; Atlantic II at Tallahassee, Fla.; 
East at Clemson, S.C.; Mideast at Knoxville, Tenn.; South at Baton Rouge, La.; 
Central at Austin, Texas; Midwest I at Stillwater, Okla., and Midwest II at 
Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State had sought a regional, but the school's paperwork was 
mishandled by the NCAA office and the bid was not presented before the original 
selections, according to Jim Wright, media coordinator for the College World 
Series. When NCAA officials realized the error, Long Beach State was 
reconsidered but the committee decided to stay with the original selections, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People do make mistakes and we can accept that, especially given the class 
and character of the NCAA office in admitting the error," Long Beach State 
Athletic Director Dave O'Brien said in a statement. "But we are extremely 
disappointed . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, Arizona State, Fresno State, San Diego State and Nevada also were 
among the 21 schools that submitted bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton (41-13) is ranked seventh in the nation by Baseball 
America and eighth by Collegiate Baseball after losing two of three games to 
USC last weekend. The Trojans are ranked ninth by Baseball America and 11th by 
Collegiate Baseball. Clemson (51-15) is No. 1 in both rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA selection committee will determine the top eight teams in a meeting 
Sunday, and each will be assigned to different regionals. The other 40 teams 
then will be assigned to regionals and the field will be announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big West Conference is expected to have three representatives. Nevada 
(39-10) has won the conference's automatic berth by sharing the championship 
and winning its three-game series with Long Beach State (38-15) and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada and Long Beach State have finished the conference season with 16-5 
records. Fullerton is 15-5 and also can tie for the championship with a victory 
Wednesday at Pacific in a makeup of a rained-out game.

NEWSWIRE: CAPRIATI ARRESTED, FACES DRUG CHARGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tennis star Jennifer Capriati was arrested Monday on a marijuana possession 
charge after police came to her hotel room in Coral Gables, Fla., to look for a 
runaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they found Capriati, 18, alone. During a search, they uncovered an 
undetermined amount of marijuana. When the female runaway and a Key Biscayne 
man, 19, arrived at the room, after pulling up in Capriati's car, they also 
were arrested on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old, not identified by authorities because of her age, was charged 
with possession of two packets of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, Tom Wineland, was suspected of possessing crack cocaine and drug 
paraphernalia and was being held on $6,000 bond at the Dade County Jail, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati was charged with possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor, and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Her agent, Linda Dozoretz of International Management Group, had no immediate 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati has not played since losing in the first round of the U.S. Open last 
August. She left the tour because of an injured elbow. In January, she said she 
wouldn't return until June. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati had been cited by Tampa police in December for misdemeanor 
shoplifting. Her agent said she inadvertently wandered off from a shopping mall 
booth with a $15 ring.

2 SENTENCED IN ASSAULT ON KERRIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shane Stant, who hit figure skater Nancy Kerrigan above the knee, and his 
uncle Derrick Smith, who drove the getaway car, were sentenced to 18 months in 
prison Monday after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit assault. 
</P>
<P>
 A third defendant, Shawn Eckardt, pleaded guilty to racketeering.His 
sentencing was delayed until July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Stant and Smith were to be held overnight in the county jail and then 
transferred into the state prison system. 
</P>
<P>
 As he left the courtroom, Eckardt reacted bitterly to the fact that Kerrigan's 
rival, Tonya Harding, received only three years' probation for her part in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that if she's going to continue to act in the manner in which she has, 
she should become a better liar," Eckardt said.

COMMENTARY; CLIPPERS, NOT EX-COACHES, ON FIRING LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In all other cities in America, with all other teams in the NBA, the firing of 
the coach would be big news. The headlines would scream, the local TV news 
would flood the scene with mini-cams, the columnists would analyze and dissect 
for eager readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the Clippers fired their coach. Yawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing is, the Clippers always fire their coach. Firemen fight fires, 
politicians lie to the public and the Clippers fire their coach. It is life as 
we know it. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's name this time is Bob Weiss. He is a nice man with considerable 
NBA experience who was the result of an almost-unprecedented-in-NBA-annals 
62-day search. The main question when he arrived was not whether he could 
coach, but whether he would have enough time to learn all of his players' 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he is gone, and his departure conjures up a number of scenes, including 
Weiss calling his wife and saying, "Honey, I've got good news. The Clippers 
just fired me." 
</P>
<P>
 The only coach to last four full seasons with this team was Jack Ramsay, and 
that was when it was the Buffalo Braves. After a six-season stop in San Diego, 
the Clippers moved to L.A. for the 1984-85 season. Weiss was the eighth coach 
in that span, if you want to include Mack Calvin, who won one of two games and 
is one of only two Clipper coaches to carry an overall .500 or better winning 
average. The other is Larry Brown, who left with a .578 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Give the Clippers credit, however. They understand that they have only 
furthered their position in the world of sports as America's knee-slap. Jay 
Leno, David Lettermen and Dennis Miller live for the Clippers to do something. 
Anything. With the Clippers around, who needs writers? 
</P>
<P>
 As one Clipper official said Monday, "We know the stereotype, and we know that 
firing the coach just feeds that stereotype." 
</P>
<P>
 That indicates the Clippers clearly believed Weiss did a bad job last year, 
because even the Clippers can take only so much of being a nightly punch line. 
</P>
<P>
 But that raises the obvious question about why, then -- once again -- was the 
Clippers' judgment so wrong, so far off, in their hiring process. Those who 
blared the trumpets less than a year ago about the wonders of Weiss now find 
him wanting. They probably would hire Madonna to run their chapel meetings, or 
Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly for strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few weeks, or perhaps months, we will have Clipper Coach No. 9 
(L.A. vintage) bursting on the scene. There will be talk of new beginnings, of 
playoff berths, of building for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In the media guide, owner Donald Sterling will be quoted as saying: "The 
addition of (fill in the blank) was a very positive step for our franchise. 
Coach (fill in the blank) is a winner and he is a superb communicator. Our 
long-term commitment to him can only bring success." 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, was what Sterling said about Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 The positive, stiff-upper-lip stance in this is that the Clippers should be 
commended for acting fast to remedy a bad situation. They believed Weiss was a 
bad coach and had to be dumped. But that's like the guy who is trying to become 
a sword-swallower seeking praise for having bandages nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The statute of limitations might have run out on the public's ability to 
accept yet another false start by the Clippers. This is, after all, Los 
Angeles, where the shows that go on only do so when they are worth the price of 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
 Were the Clippers stumbling along elsewhere, fans would show up wearing paper 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
 In L.A., they simply stop showing up.

SAN DIEGO STATE HIRES JC COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Trenkle, a highly successful junior college coach in Idaho, Monday was 
named basketball coach at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Trenkle was given a five-year contract to try to revive San Diego State, which 
has had nine consecutive losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Trenkle was 329-34 from 1983 to 1993 at the College of Southern Idaho, which 
reached the national JC tournament eight consecutive seasons and won it in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a challenge," Trenkle said. "It's going to be a little bit 
different than what I've been used to. . . . I've never been a loser, and I'm 
not going to start now." 
</P>
<P>
 Trenkle, 45, replaces Tony Fuller, who took over at Pepperdine on May 5.

WEST IGNORED IN NCAA REGIONAL SITE SELECTIONS; COLLEGE BASEBALL: LONG BEACH 
STATE'S PROPOSAL GETS INADVERTENTLY LOST IN THE STAPLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NCAA announced the eight regional sites for the 48-team Division I 
baseball tournament Monday, and for the first time since the regional format 
was adopted in 1975, the West was shut out. 
</P>
<P>
 No school felt more left out than Long Beach State, which submitted a bid to 
conduct a regional at refurbished Blair Field, then learned after the 
selections were announced that its proposal had not even been considered by the 
Division I baseball committee because of an NCAA administrative error. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, however, would probably have been considered a longshot. The 
continuing shift in power and influence in college baseball was evident in the 
selections, which include five Southern, two Midwestern and one Southwestern 
school as regional hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional sites and dates: Atlantic I at Miami May 27-30; Atlantic II at 
Tallahassee, Fla., May 26-29; East at Clemson, S.C., May 26-29; Mideast at 
Knoxville, Tenn., May 26-29; South at Baton Rouge, La., May 26-29; Central at 
Austin, Tex., May 27-30; Midwest I at Stillwater, Okla., May 27-30, and Midwest 
II at Wichita, Kan., May 27-30. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the tournament, which ends with the eight-team College World 
Series in Omaha June 3-12, will be announced next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Keilitz, chairman of the baseball committee, said the criteria for 
selecting regional sites include the quality of the facility, revenue 
potential, attendance history and potential, geographic location and whether 
the host school is likely to gain a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Keilitz said 21 schools submitted regional bids, among them Stanford, Arizona 
State, Fresno State, San Diego State and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Keilitz and the other members of the baseball committee were unaware Long 
Beach State had submitted a bid. Dennis Poppe, the NCAA's director of 
championships, said someone in the NCAA office inadvertently attached the 
school's proposal to another bid, so it was never reviewed by the committee, an 
error that was discovered after a reporter asked Keilitz during a conference 
call why Long Beach's bid had fallen short. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time I can remember something like that happening," Poppe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called (Long Beach State) and told them of this situation. There was no 
assurance that they would have been selected, but I'm sure they would have been 
given consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Coach Dave Snow said: "As coaches, we get a working manual of a 
thousand rules that we have to follow in our programs . . . and then something 
of this magnitude comes along that we can be a part of and something gets 
stapled. It just baffles me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Milano, baseball coach at California and the West's lone representative on 
the nine-member baseball committee, said he was shocked by the snubbing of the 
West, which is generally regarded as the one of the strongest regions. 
</P>
<P>
 "West Coast baseball is getting shunned," Milano said. "We as an area need to 
get support from the conference offices to fight what has become a battle of 
respectability."

MALFUNCTIONING TIMER JEOPARDIZES MEET RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As many as a dozen athletes may have been improperly prevented from qualifying 
for this Saturday's Southern Section Division I track and field finals, and a 
top national mark is also in jeopardy, after The Times Orange County learned 
that the Accutrack automatic timing system at Saturday's preliminaries 
malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing system's percussion device failed before the start of the girls' 
100-meter low hurdles race -- the fifth event -- and remained inoperable for 
the rest of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that they didn't fix it," said Bob McGuire, the Division I meet 
manager. "They had a glitch and nobody made me aware of it. It was being 
started manually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The timing device attaches to the starter's gun and "hears" its firing, which 
starts the clock. The clock is stopped at the finish line by a photo-finish 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
 After discovering the percussion device was not working properly, Joe Raya, 
the Accutrack operator Saturday at Long Beach Veterans Stadium, asked a track 
and field equipment supplier in attendance if he had a spare one. He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "The starter box wouldn't activate," Raya said Monday. "So what I did was 
start the races manually by hitting the button on the side of the machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Raya, at the finish line, started the Accutrack by hand at the sound of the 
gun, but allowed the machine to record automatic times. 
</P>
<P>
 National Federation of State High School Assn. rules stipulate that when an 
automatic timing system fails, races are to be hand timed. Officials say they 
did not know of the Accutrack's malfunctioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's news to me," said Dean Crowley, acting Southern Section commissioner, 
when questioned Monday night. "We had a meeting on Sunday and no one said 
diddly to me about it. We had no problems with the Division I meet. If there 
were problems, why didn't this come out? We ran this race Saturday and no one 
said anything to (Southern Section officials). 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major deal in my opinion. If that happened, I don't understand why 
Raya is keeping this thing a big secret. This is incomprehensible. If (the 
Accutrack) malfunctioned and (Raya) operated that thing and didn't tell 
anybody, then I have a real problem with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Raya: "The starter knew, and I think everybody else around the finish 
line did, too." 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire, who teaches at La Mirada High and is a former track and field and 
cross-country coach, has been involved with coordinating meets for 14 years. He 
says he is dumbfounded by what has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't explain this," McGuire said. "We work as a big group, but not 
everything comes through me. I'm not trying to duck the blame or pass it 
around, but I'm all over the place (during a meet). 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure would have been nice if whoever was aware of this Saturday would have 
let me know. They should have told me. For somebody at the site to sit on top 
of that information, it doesn't help us." 
</P>
<P>
 In hand-timed races, any time above a 10th of a second (10.11 or 10.19) is 
rounded up to its nearest 10th (10.2). Because races were being timed by the 
Accutrack, runners advanced to Saturday's finals or were eliminated based on 
times recorded to the 100th of a second. If hand times had been used, ties 
would have resulted and run-offs held, with the winners advancing. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Capistrano Valley's Laurel Simpson posted a 15.31 time in Heat 3 
of the girls' 100 low hurdles. In Heat 5, Roberta Burns of Dana Hills ran a 
15.32. Under national federation rules, both times should have been rounded up 
to 15.4 and a run-off held. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because automatic timing was used at the race's finish, Simpson 
qualified for Saturday's section finals and Burns was eliminated -- improperly. 
After reviewing Division I results, as many as a dozen other runners appear to 
have been improperly eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire said section officials began reviewing times from the races in 
question late Monday, after talking with The Times. He spoke at length with 
Crowley and discussions will continue today among section officials to develop 
a course of action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing about high school championships is that this is for the 
kids," Crowley said. "If something did go wrong and kids were hurt, then we've 
got to go back and make it right." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on times recorded by the malfunctioning Accutrack, Redlands' Pat Johnson 
posted the nation's fastest wind-aided 100-meter clocking (10.19 seconds) of 
the year. Had his race been hand-timed, he would have finished in 10.2 seconds, 
which converts to 10.44 automatic. Johnson's personal best is 10.42. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope everyone will be reasonable about it and understand. I guess it 
depends on the position you take," McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a problem, but it's by no means insurmountable." 
</P>
<P>

SUNNY HILLS WINS SECTION TEAM GOLF TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunny Hills surprised two-time defending champion Palm Desert to win the 
Southern Section team golf title Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 All signs pointed to another easy Palm Desert victory. The Aztec players had 
spent the previous night in their own homes and made the short drive to the 
familiar 6,869-yard course at Canyon Country Club. Then they posted a score of 
380, 17 strokes better than their title-winning score two years ago on this 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunny Hills matched the 380 and won a one-hole playoff by a stroke when 
sixth-man Matt Sims made a one-foot putt for bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara San Marcos finished third in 388, Long Beach Millikan was fourth 
in 391. Esperanza (393), Los Angeles Loyola (395) and Huntington Beach (396) 
were the only other teams to break 400. The top four advanced to the 
CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. championships June 6 at Redlands Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Palm Desert players broke 80, led by senior Jeremy Whiting, who finished 
with a two-under-par 70, tying him with Torrance junior Ted Oh and San Marcos 
junior Mike Berg for the low round of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills had four players under 80. Sophomore Terry Noe and freshman John 
Park each shot 72, freshman Jin Park shot 74 and Jenny Lee shot 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims, a senior who won an intra-team playoff to qualify to play Monday, shot 
83, as did freshman Mike Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 In the playoff, Sunny Hills put on the pressure immediately. Jin Park made a 
five-foot putt for birdie on the 379-yard, par-4 first hole and Noe made par. 
Whiting made par and Paul Cotterell bogeyed, putting the Lancers ahead by two. 
</P>
<P>
 Palm Desert got a stroke back in the second foursome when Bryan Geiberger, son 
of PGA Senior player Al Geiberger, chipped in from the fringe for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final group, Kim and Palm Desert's Nicole Dalkas made par and Palm 
Desert's Chris Meyerson made bogey, leaving Sims about a foot away from the 
winning bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney said he was impressed that the Lancers could 
come to an unfamiliar course in the desert and beat one of the home teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's a credit to the fact that our kids have played some very good 
courses," Devaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza, ranked second in Orange County one place ahead of Sunny Hills, 
finished fifth despite a solid score. Senior Chris Berry shot one-under 71, 
sophomore Ryan Donovan 74 and senior Jason Henderson 78. But no other Aztec 
broke 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-ranked Huntington Beach, which beat Sunny Hills in a dual match late in 
the regular season, also came up short. The Oilers had four players in the 70s: 
Gabe Shiwota (76), Jeff Farley (77), Greg Uberuaga (79) and Perry Dickey (79). 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills, the surprise winner of the Southern Regional title last week, 
finished ninth at 406. Matt Johnson (79) was the only Dolphin player to break 
80.

ROYAL DANO; CHARACTER ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Royal Dano, the durable character actor who graced some 300 films and 
television shows over more than four decades, died Sunday at his home in Santa 
Monica. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Dano died of pulmonary fibrosis, and his wife, Peggy, and son, Richard, were 
at his side, said Milton Ebbins, Dano's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebbins said the Western and action film entertainer was also known for 
portraying Abraham Lincoln. Ebbins said Dano provided the voice used in 
Disneyland's original animatronic version of the Civil War President. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New York and educated at New York University, Dano had the height and 
brawny good looks for various supporting roles, and often played villains. 
</P>
<P>
 He began his career on Broadway and made his film debut in 1950 in "Undercover 
Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Dano's other films included "The Red Badge of Courage" in 1951, "Johnny 
Guitar" in 1954, "The Trouble With Harry" in 1955, "Moby Dick" in 1956, "The 
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" in 1960 and "King of Kings," in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, he appeared in "The Undefeated" in 1969, "Skin Game" in 1971, 
"The Outlaw Josey Wales" in 1976 and "The Right Stuff" in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Dano was honored along with Robert Horton, Will Hutchins and Marie 
Windsor by the Tuolumne County Wild West Film Festival as a veteran of Westerns 
filmed in the California Gold Country. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife and son, Dano is survived by a brother, Caleb; a 
sister, Martha, and a grandson.

ERWIN GLIKES; PUBLISHER OF SOCIAL CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Erwin A. Glikes, an admired, sometimes controversial publisher of social 
criticism, has died at the age of 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Glikes died Friday of a heart attack en route from Manhattan to his weekend 
home in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 He had recently joined Penguin U.S.A., where he was to have headed a new 
nonfiction division, True North Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 But he made his major mark over the past generation as president and publisher 
of Basic Books in the 1970s, then head of trade publishing at Simon & Schuster, 
and for the past decade as president and publisher of The Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
 If any conservative in the United States ever fit the definition "a liberal 
who has been mugged," it might have been the redoubtable, intellectually 
independent Glikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Antwerp, Belgium, the son of Jewish refugees from Hitler, he began 
adult life as a literary critic and professor of English at Columbia 
University. In 1968, when he was an assistant dean at Columbia, the campus 
exploded in sometimes violent protests. Those events were the beginning of 
second thoughts for many liberals on that campus and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 One was University of Chicago philosopher Alan Bloom, whose book "The Closing 
of the American Mind" had, for a book of its seriousness, an unprecedented run 
on the bestseller list. Glikes, who took his own second thoughts into a 
publishing career that began the year after the Columbia protests, was Bloom's 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other intellectually distinguished critiques of American society from a 
center-right position, two that Glikes published at The Free Press became 
winners of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in the Current Interest category: 
in 1991 Francis Fukuyama's "The End of History and the Last Man" and last year 
Peter Skerry's "Mexican Americans: The Ambivalent Minority." 
</P>
<P>
 The fame of such higher-profile conservatives on Glikes' authors' list as 
George Will and Robert Bork made them easy to sell, but Glikes, who persuaded 
the large corporations he worked for to give him close control over sales and 
publicity, was most admired for his ability to find commercial success with 
unknown, intellectually demanding writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime expert James Q. Wilson of UCLA, whom Glikes persuaded to collect the 
articles that became Wilson's influential "Thinking About Crime," said Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 "Erwin understood my book in some ways better than I did myself. He explained 
to me how and where other people might respond to what I had been thinking and 
writing. The book that resulted reached a far wider audience than I would ever 
have thought possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Valued by his authors as a conversation partner, Glikes was liked by his 
professional colleagues for his unfailing generosity and courtesy. In 
extemporaneous remarks at the close of a panel discussion on publishing in 
March, Glikes touched many with searching comments on the latter-day rise in 
book publishing of a "culture of nastiness" in which rudeness "far from being 
recognized as a vice is taken as a proof of brilliance." 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Carol Janeway, a vice president at Alfred A. 
Knopf, and two children, Lela and Michael.

STATE SEEKS RETURN OF PEIRANO GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $100,000 state grant given to Ventura for preservation of the historic 
Peirano building must be returned now that the building is facing demolition, a 
state agency has told the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials, who have ordered that the crumbling, aging market be razed 
to expose a Spanish laundry underneath, say they believe that they may have a 
right to keep the money to use in restoring the laundry and two walls that are 
not scheduled for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Notification that the state wants its money back came in a May 9 letter to 
Mayor Tom Buford from the State Office of Historic Preservation, which gave 
Ventura the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This office cannot support a proposal that calls for demolition of a 
significant historic resource such as the Peirano Market purchased with state 
grant funds," reads the letter signed by Cherilyn E. Widell, a state historic 
preservation officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford said City Council members knew that the historic preservation office 
might make such a demand. "We had hoped that wasn't going to be the case, but 
the council understood it might be a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members, however, added that this might not be the end of the 
issue. "This is not our understanding of what the legislation said," Pat 
Richardson, a city planner, said of the state office's claim that laws dictate 
that Ventura return the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1877, the Main Street landmark was once a neighborhood grocery and 
still sports cheery murals on its west wall, advertising Borax laundry 
detergent and Ghirardelli's chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted in March to sell the building to Ventura Realty for 
$75,000 to $100,000 rather than spend about $430,000 in city funds to restore 
it to current seismic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Realty plans to keep the front and west side of the city's oldest 
brick building while knocking down the rest. The Spanish lavanderia would also 
remain, restored and surrounded by restaurants, shops and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer is still in negotiations with the city on the property and has 
yet to destroy the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to raze the historic structure angered local artists and 
preservationists, and about 80 people jammed City Hall the night that the 
council voted on the building's demolition. They asked council members to 
consider another developer's proposal because it would save the market and 
convert an adjoining photography studio to a municipal art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists submitted petitions signed by 2,000 residents, imploring the 
council to save the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those residents hailed the state's letter as reaffirmation of their 
local struggle against the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should give (the city) second thoughts," said Miriam Mack, a Ventura 
resident and the city's former redevelopment administrator. "The state has come 
out clearly, in black and white, and I think demolishing Peirano's now will 
jeopardize the city's reputation in the future with the state, in terms of 
preservation." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's May 9 letter emphatically reaffirms the agency's commitment to 
preserving the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short of a submission of a preponderance of evidence to the contrary," the 
letter states, "the State Office of Historic Preservation has no reason to 
believe that the property is any less significant now than it was at the time 
it was designated by the State Historical Resources Commission." 
</P>
<P>
 The city purchased the Peirano building from Nick Peirano in 1987 for 
$185,000. Of that amount, $100,000 came from the state grant for the purpose of 
preserving the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, city officials thought that they would lease the old grocery to a 
restaurant or some other type of business. They soon discovered, however, that 
almost no one -- including the city itself -- wanted to allocate the massive 
funds required to seismically retrofit the aging structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Realty's proposal seemed to council members the best way to get rid of 
the once-prized property. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Richardson says, city officials must continue to try to persuade state 
preservation officers that the lavanderia buried underneath the building is as 
important or more important to preserve than the former market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the way we read the stipulations that come with the grant, we could 
potentially avoid refunding the grant if we use the money on other historic 
preservation within the project area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That would include restoring portions of the Peirano facade scheduled to 
remain standing, or excavating and restoring the lavanderia to a condition 
where it can be on public display, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state historic preservation office also wrote in the letter that 
demolition of the Peirano building may require a formal environmental review. 
But Richardson said city staff had expected that some sort of review would be 
necessary to assess the impact on area archeology.

ARMED MAN SURRENDERS IN STANDOFF WITH POLICE; VENTURA: DON ALAN LAMBERT IS 
ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF ATTEMPTED MURDER. HE ALLEGEDLY FIRED A SHOTGUN AT HIS 
GIRLFRIEND'S FRIEND DURING A DISPUTE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A standoff between Ventura police and a suspect in an attempted murder ended 
without injury early Monday when investigators closed off Main Street and 
persuaded the barricaded man to surrender peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Alan Lambert, the 33-year-old boyfriend of one of the alleged victims, was 
arrested about 2:40 a.m. Monday on suspicion of attempted murder after firing a 
shotgun at a woman, then holding police at bay for more than five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail and is 
scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Lambert had been drinking at several bars with his girlfriend, 
Linda Holycross, 36, and two of her friends Sunday evening when an argument 
broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert then returned to the three-room apartment he shared with Holycross in 
the 1200 block of Main, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the three women arrived an hour later, another disagreement broke out and 
Lambert fired a shotgun at Sonia Taylor, 28, of Oxnard, who was unharmed by the 
spray of buckshot, police said. The shot penetrated the top of the back door 
and spattered lead pellets across the porch. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor returning home from work about 9 p.m. Sunday heard raised voices 
coming from the upstairs apartment moments before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lady said, 'Don't point that at me,' " said the neighbor, who declined to 
give his name. "Then it went off. I went to my neighbor's house and called 
911." 
</P>
<P>
 The three women ran outside before police arrived. At one point early in the 
confrontation, police said Lambert grabbed Holycross and dragged her back into 
the apartment, but she was able to break free and escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, more than a dozen officers swarmed around the perimeter of the 
downtown block, closing off Crimea and Hemlock streets, but allowing traffic 
along Main. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early police reports indicated that Lambert might be a heavily armed 
survivalist who might welcome a gunfight with authorities. Witnesses told 
investigators that several weapons could be inside the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only gun they seized (Monday) was the shotgun," Lt. Steve Bowman said. 
"Everybody heard that there were supposedly more guns in the house, but I 
haven't been able to find anybody that actually saw another one." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents milled around the neighborhood for hours while gun-toting police 
waited Lambert out. But the neighbors did not seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "A human life is more important than a little inconvenience," said Michael 
Whitney, a liquor store clerk who got off work about midnight but was not 
allowed near his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police tried to reach Lambert by telephone, but he refused to answer, Bowman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Special Weapons and Tactics unit was called in about 12:30 a.m. SWAT team 
members closed off Main Street, shot out the street lamps surrounding the 
apartment and prepared to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time works," said Bowman, explaining Lambert's eventual surrender. "The 
adrenaline drains off and you realize this is really stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 a.m., a westbound driver struck an unoccupied police car blocking 
several lanes of Main Street and flashing its red and blue lights. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the crash, which caused significant damage to both 
vehicles. Gabriel Ibarraran Arteaga, 26, of Ventura was arrested on suspicion 
of driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 2 a.m., five hours after the shotgun blast was reported, police 
using a loudspeaker urged Lambert to come out of the apartment with his hands 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, the suspect answered telephone calls from police and agreed to 
surrender. "They finally got through to him," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert emerged from the home with his arms raised, wearing a sweat shirt, 
jeans and no shoes. SWAT team members handcuffed the suspect and turned him 
over to Officers Skip Young and Ross Nideffer, who said they had no idea why 
Lambert chose so suddenly to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said Lambert is a commercial painter who works out of the garage 
beneath the apartment he has shared with Holycross for more than a year.

POLL FINDS MOST BELIEVE THAT THORNTON IS GUILTY OF SLAYING; COURTS: IN 
CHANGE-OF-VENUE REQUEST, DEFENSE SAYS 66% BELIEVE THAT THE TEEN-AGER KILLED A 
WESTLAKE NURSE. PROSECUTORS OPPOSE ANY MOVE.

 Two-thirds of Ventura County's registered voters believe that accused killer 
Mark Scott Thornton murdered Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan in September, 
according to a poll aimed at getting the trial moved to another county. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, made public Monday as part of a defense change-of-venue request 
filed in Superior Court, says 85% of the county's voters have some awareness of 
the slaying and another 66% believe that Thornton is guilty of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is apparent that this case has become embedded in the collective memory of 
the residents of Ventura County, making it impossible for Mark Scott Thornton 
to receive a fair and impartial trial," Deputy Public Defenders Howard J. Asher 
and Susan R. Olson said in the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Thornton, 19, kidnaped and fatally shot O'Sullivan, 34, during a 
carjacking. A grand jury Dec. 6 indicted the teen-ager, charging him with 
kidnaping and murder under special circumstances, which could send him to the 
gas chamber. Prosecutors plan to oppose a change of venue. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Peter D. Kossoris said prosecutors are arranging to have their own public 
opinion poll on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The change-of-venue papers were filed Friday. But they were kept from the 
public until Monday, when Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath agreed to 
allow the public to inspect them. 
</P>
<P>
 Other records in the case, including a transcript of grand jury testimony, 
have been sealed. At the request of The Times and Ventura County Newspapers, 
McGrath has said he will release them -- but not until after he rules on the 
motion June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Public defenders also said Monday that they plan to ask the judge to throw out 
Thornton's indictment because the district attorney's office helped screen the 
grand jury that indicted him. 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney investigators have historically conducted background checks 
on prospective grand jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Asher and Olson said those background checks became much more extensive 
two years ago when a new law gave the grand jury power to hand out indictments 
in criminal cases. Previously, the grand jury only investigated political 
corruption and government inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, the grand jury has delivered indictments in 99 cases, compared 
with only a handful of such indictments during the 1980s, court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time defense attorneys have cited alleged problems with 
grand jury selection in an attempt to have charges dismissed against Thornton. 
A judge refused earlier to grant public defenders access to grand jury records 
after they claimed that the panel did not include enough Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Thornton and his alleged victim are white. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in a case like this, they are going to try to raise everything they 
can," Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the change-of-venue request, Asher said more people in Ventura County 
seem aware of the Thornton case than many other high-profile crimes in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The random, scientific public opinion poll was conducted by the Social Science 
Survey Center at Cal State Chico. It involved telephone interviews with 403 
registered voters in the county and had a margin of error of about 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher said that moving the case to another location would save Ventura County 
time and money in trying to seat an impartial jury for Thornton's trial 
locally. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that only one-third of the voters in Ventura County have not decided 
that Thornton is guilty and that many potential jurors would have to be excused 
because of financial hardship or opposition to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thornton trial is expected to last four months or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think trying to cure this through jury selection is going to help," 
Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense motion said 140 news stories have been published in the county's 
seven newspapers since Sept. 16, two days after O'Sullivan disappeared.

TAPPING INTO THE PROCESS OF LEARNING; CLASS LINKS MASTERY OF MUSICAL BEAT TO 
ACADEMIC SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With all eyes trained on their teacher, the group of second-graders at 
Ventura's Mound School tried to follow her every move as they clapped their 
hands, slapped their thighs and kicked their heels to the tune of blue-grass 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 But some children were struggling: Their hands hit their left knees when they 
should have gone to the right. Their legs flew up into kicks at the moment that 
they should have hit the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of hard to get the message down to your legs as fast as the music," 
7-year-old Kerianne Hewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning to get messages from the mind to the body as swiftly as possible is 
precisely the point of Mound's motor-skills class. 
</P>
<P>
 The elementary school launched the class four years ago based on research 
showing that the ability to respond physically to a musical beat is closely 
linked to children's skills in reading, writing and concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 And the class is working, Principal Beverly McCaslin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have noticed it helps kids concentrate and hold their attention span 
longer," she said. "We have seen kids who have difficulty reading and writing 
improve because they are able to organize their thoughts better." 
</P>
<P>
 Mound teacher Joanne Bowie leads the motor-skills instruction every Friday for 
each of the school's first- through fifth-grade classes. 
</P>
<P>
 During some classes, the students clap, march or jump rope. In others, they 
recite poems to music. "I try to present it in a variety of ways just to keep 
the interest up," Bowie said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the goal in all the class activities is to help children learn to keep a 
steady one-two beat with the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowie bases her instruction mainly on workshops she has taken from Phyllis S. 
Weikart, a retired physical education professor from the University of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 A nationally recognized expert in motor-skills development for children, 
Weikart maintains that children should begin to develop an innate sense of 
timing when they are infants. 
</P>
<P>
 When care-givers pat or stroke babies to the tune of a lullaby, for example, 
they are helping the children make a connection between what they hear and what 
they do, Weikart said in an interview from her Michigan home. 
</P>
<P>
 That "hearing-feeling connection," as Weikart calls it, is what allows 
children to listen to something that is being said or watch something that is 
being done and follow the directions. "What you're linking is action, thought 
and language," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And having a sense of inner timing allows children to speak or read in whole 
sentences instead of just one word at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 But studies show the number of children with the ability to keep a steady beat 
has declined in recent decades from a range of 80% to 90% to about 10%, Weikart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's probably the most fundamental of all the problems we face in 
education today," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She believes that the fault lies partly with adults who mistakenly believe 
that children respond better to the rhythm of words or syllables than to a 
steady beat. Many adults today, for example, clap the hand game "Patty Cake" 
with children to the rhythm of the words' syllables rather than to a steady 
one-two beat, Weikart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening today is that the children are receiving movement 
stimulation in rhythm rather than in beat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mound, Bowie said she finds at the beginning of each year that only about 
one-third of the students can independently keep a steady beat. By the end of 
the year, the number climbs to two-third. 
</P>
<P>
 And the children said they have become more confident about their abilities to 
move to music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just really shy" at first, 8-year-old Jordan Frye said. "It's just 
really neat to see that you can dance."

SPANISH HILLS BUILDER SEEKS ZONING FOR 89-HOME PROJECT; CAMARILLO PLANNING 
COMMISSION TO CONSIDER PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Builders of the Spanish Hills housing development will ask the Camarillo 
Planning Commission tonight to consider a proposal to build 89 single-family 
houses on a 52-acre parcel on the city's northwest side. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes, ranging in size from 1,900 to 2,500 square feet, are proposed for 
vacant land near Earl Joseph and West Ponderosa drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish Hills Development Co. is seeking to change the property's zoning from 
rural residential to residential planned development, which would more than 
double the number of lots that could be built on the site -- from 39 to 89. The 
project would be more modest than a nearby 430-acre Spanish Hills housing and 
golf course development, where houses are 3,500 square feet or larger. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because the developer has so far failed to reach an agreement on what 
fees it would pay the Pleasant Valley School District, city staff members will 
ask the commission to postpone a final decision until June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick O'Donnell, executive director of development for Spanish Hills, said 
Monday that the company recognizes that its development will bring in new 
students and create an additional strain on the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the state School Facilities Act, developers must pay school 
districts $2.65 per square foot for each residential project that is built. But 
when a zone change is requested, a school district can request higher fees than 
the state minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell would not say what caused the delay in the fee negotiations, which 
initially were expected to be finished before tonight's meeting. He also 
declined to detail terms the two parties have on the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are close to working out an acceptable deal," O'Donnell said. "I believe 
that we will have something worked out before the end of the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Boden, Camarillo's director of planning and community development, 
said he also believes that the two sides will reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials could not be reached for comment Monday. But in a 
Friday letter to the city, Pleasant Valley Associate Supt. Howard Hamilton said 
that the district's 13 schools were at or near capacity and that the new 
Spanish Hills development promises to adversely affect the district unless the 
proper amount in development fees can be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Planning Commission approves the proposal, the plan then must be 
approved by the City Council, which rules on all zoning changes. The council 
has tentatively scheduled the issue for its June 22 meeting. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo Planning Commission will hold a public hearing tonight on a 
proposal by Spanish Hills Development Co. to build 89 single-family houses on a 
52-acre parcel adjacent to the company's upscale housing and golf course 
development. The commission meeting starts at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall, 601 
Carmen Drive. A vote is tentatively scheduled for the commission's June 7 
meeting.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO MANSLAUGHTER IN KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard man pleaded guilty Monday to voluntary manslaughter for killing his 
ex-girlfriend's son on Christmas, and attorneys have recommended that he 
receive a six-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea by 32-year-old Jose Jimenez comes two weeks after a jury acquitted 
him of murder but deadlocked on a lesser charge of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged Jimenez with murder in the stabbing death of Isaias 
Guerrero Morales, 21. Guerrero was knifed in the yard of his family's Campbell 
Way home. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Jimenez's plea, prosecutors agreed to drop an allegation that he used a 
deadly weapon. They also agreed to recommend that Superior Court Judge Lawrence 
Storch sentence him to six years in prison, instead of the 12-year term he 
could have faced. 
</P>
<P>
 With credit for time already served and good behavior, Jimenez will probably 
be out of prison in 2 1/2 years, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris was unable to persuade the jury to 
convict Jimenez of murder. Storch declared a mistrial after the jury deadlocked 
11 to 1 in favor of conviction on the manslaughter charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it was second-degree murder, but we had a fair trial before a fair 
jury," Kossoris said Monday. "I'm a little disappointed for the victim's family 
because they feel the defendant should have gotten more." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Joseph Villasana, Jimenez's lawyer, said his client did 
not want to face a second trial and the possibility of being sentenced to 12 
years on a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client is satisfied. He understands he could have gone to trial and lost," 
Villasana said. "It's a tragedy. He knows that. This is his (former) 
girlfriend's son. He worked with him." DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CREWS CONTAIN ACID SPILLS IN SIMI, VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Firefighters responded Monday to two separate incidents of spilled 
hydrochloric acid solutions, blocking off businesses and streets in Simi Valley 
and Ventura before neutralizing the powerful acid. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, firefighters responded about 8 a.m. to a report of acid in a 
commercial dumpster in the 2200 block of Agate Court, an industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters found half a gallon of muriatic acid in a dumpster behind 
Plexcom, a computer company, Ventura County Fire Capt. Keith Mashburn said. 
Muriatic acid is 30% hydrochloric acid and frequently used to clean swimming 
pools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sending off visible fumes," Mashburn said. Authorities said that the 
acid was in a bottle but that the cap was knocked off when trash was thrown 
into the dumpster. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Saenz, a hazardous materials specialist, said firefighters blocked off the 
parking lot for a few hours and used a solution similar to baking soda to 
neutralize the acid. They used an absorbent to pick up the spill and carried it 
away in bags, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Plexcom workers complained of minor throat irritation but returned to 
work, Saenz said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 minutes after the Simi Valley spill, Ventura authorities received a 
call about a gallon of muriatic acid that had spilled on Main Street near 
Telephone Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The acid, which was in a can, tumbled off a vehicle traveling west on Main 
Street, Ventura Fire Capt. Glenn True said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was affected by the spill, which was neutralized with baking soda and 
washed away, True said. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CROWD OF 400 TURNS OUT TO HEAR STEINEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only reason that Ventura attorney S. Blake Wade endured the hassle of 
waiting in a long line and standing in a hot crowded Ventura meeting hall 
Monday night was to hear feminist author Gloria Steinem. 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely what Steinem said was not the point, Wade said. "She's always been 
our banner holder," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Steinem's half-hour talk, Wade said she felt inspired not only by 
the speaker but by the crowd itself, which numbered 400 and ranged in age from 
15 to 75. Nearly all were women. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that Ventura County is usually relatively quiet, the size and 
diversity of the crowd "made me feel very proud," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the crowd that got into the meeting hall, another 100 people 
had to be turned away because of lack of space. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Ventura Bookstore, Steinem's visit to Ventura is part of her 
tour to promote her latest book, "Moving Beyond Words." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said in an interview that she is relieved that bookstores generally do 
not require people to buy books to hear an author, because one of her main 
goals at such events is to bring together people of shared progressive and 
feminist beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The comfort from an occasion like this is seeing you're not the only one who 
cares about these issues," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when the crowd greeted Steinem with an explosion of applause, she tried 
to turn the spotlight back on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know in our hearts we know we're all applauding for each other," she said. 
"We come together so we get a fix of energy." 
</P>
<P>
 By being in a room with hundreds of other like-minded people, she said, "we 
understand that we're not crazy. The system is crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinem discussed a range of topics, including how women must continue to 
demand more help from men in raising children and running a home. "Until men 
are equal in the home, women can't be equal outside the home." 
</P>
<P>
 Having recently turned 60, Steinem also touched on one of the major themes of 
her new book: the unexpected joys of getting older. "Now, at 60, I feel like 
I'm entering a new country and it's a country nobody told me about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And for many members of her audience, Steinem is still charting the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just identify with her," said Evelyn Leichliter, who was born the same week 
as Steinem. "While I was busy raising children, she was changing the world."

 An Oxnard police officer suffered minor injuries Monday afternoon when a man 
driving a pickup truck pulled in front of the officer's motorcycle, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Joseph Johnson, 35, was driving west on 5th Street when Ruben Gomez, 
31, of Oxnard drove out of an alley at A Street in front of the officer, police 
said. Johnson attempted to avoid the collision, but broadsided the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center, where he was treated 
for bruises to his knees, shoulder and back before being released, police said. 
Gomez was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police said Gomez failed to yield the right of way to Johnson, no 
charges are pending. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; MOTORIST ARRESTED AFTER HITTING 
BICYCLIST

<P>
 Police arrested a Port Hueneme man after he allegedly struck a 10-year-old 
bicyclist, then dragged her bike under his van for two blocks before fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Mojica Prado, 29, was being held Monday in Ventura County Jail on 
suspicion of felony hit-and-run, driving under the influence of alcohol and 
evading an officer.His bail is $5,000. Arraignment was set today. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they arrested Prado on Sunday evening after a van he was driving 
on Scott Street hit a parked car and struck Kelly Noble, who was riding her 
bike on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble was knocked off her bike and received minor injuries, police said. Her 
bike became wedged under Prado's van as he fled after the crash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers saw Prado several blocks later at Hueneme and Saviers roads. He led 
them on a brief chase that ended at Edison Road, which dead-ends, and was 
arrested without incident, police said. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CLEANUP PLANNED FOR LIBBEY PARK STREAMS

 The Ojai Valley Land Conservancy will sponsor a community cleanup of Libbey 
Park's streams Saturday as part of a long-term plan to restore the valley's 
waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Concerned Resource and Environmental Workers, an Ojai-based 
youth employment and conservation group, volunteers will clear trash and debris 
from the park's streams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai's Libbey Park Master Plan calls for rehabilitation of the streams, which 
once ran year-round through the 13-acre park. Now, the two waterways are 
eroding and full of weeds and debris, said Ellen Hall, administrative director 
of the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 When they do run, the streams often carry trash into San Antonio Creek and the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's cleanup is the first step in a larger restoration plan for the 
waterways, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to bring together a team of interested citizens and experts to plan 
how we can replant the streams and make them the educational resource they can 
be for the community," she said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup will begin at 9 a.m. at the park's gazebo. The event will conclude 
with a picnic at noon, where participants will receive free ice cream and 
lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call the conservancy at 646-7930. TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: REMOVE BRUSH OR FACE FINES, FIRE OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With the opening of fire season today, Ventura County Fire Department 
officials are warning property owners to clear brush away from buildings or 
face fines and fees for the Fire Department to have the work done. 
</P>
<P>
 Below-average rainfall this year has allowed the grass to dry out earlier than 
usual, increasing the threat of fire, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your fire service will do its best to maintain a high level of service in 
these difficult times," department spokeswoman Sandi Wells said. "We are 
counting on the public we serve to assist us in this common effort. Together we 
can be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Home or business owners with overgrown brush must clear their lots by June 1 
to be in compliance with county regulations under a weed abatement program 
county supervisors are expected to approve today. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department officials said 97% of property owners usually comply. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 20, about 17,000 property owners in the county fire district received 
notices to clear their properties, fire officials said. Anything over three 
inches tall must be trimmed, and brush must be cleared within 100 feet of 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said their brush clearing rules are stricter than in most 
counties, which require a 30-foot clearance. But the stricter regulations 
helped keep fire damage during the Green Meadow fire in October relatively low, 
Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 If property owners do not comply, fire officials typically have a contractor 
do the work and add a $221 administrative fee. The charges are added to 
residents' property tax bills as special assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 The weed abatement rules help stop fires from spreading to other homes, County 
Fire Capt. Loyd Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to eliminate the fuel that will feed a fire," Wood said. "The intent 
is to give the property owner the ability to protect his home with a garden 
hose in case the firefighters can't be there." PEGGY Y. LEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FORMER EDUCATOR TO RUN FOR COLLEGE BOARD

 Saying the district needs tighter fiscal control and better access to its 
managers, former educator John Tallman said Monday that he will run for a seat 
on the Ventura County Community College District's Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Tallman, who worked as a teacher and vice chancellor at Ventura College for 
more than 20 years, said he will try to beat out incumbent Karen Boone in Area 
1 on the fall ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision-making process could be better," said Tallman, a Ventura 
resident who retired last year. "Faculty voices aren't heard at all, and some 
people are intimidated from speaking. Therefore, the best decisions are not 
always made." 
</P>
<P>
 Tallman, 64, said the district "is fiscally fragile and unstable due to poor 
income projections and lack of awareness of changing conditions" in the funding 
processes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district badly needs a trustee with an understanding of community college 
finance," said Tallman, who spent one year as chief fiscal officer at Ventura 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone, appointed to the board in 1992 when Gregory Kampf resigned, has already 
said she would seek election. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-week filing period for candidates opens July 18. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: UNION ARGUES CASE ON PENSION FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The county's retired workers should continue receiving supplemental benefits, 
but not at the expense of future retirees, representatives of Ventura County's 
public employees union argued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of dipping into funds reserved for future payments, the county should 
use general fund revenues or look for a permanent way to pay the supplemental 
benefits on which retirees have come to rely, Steve Wood, president of Service 
Employees International Union, Local 998, said at a county Board of Retirement 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We resent the effort that is being made to attempt to make the issue one that 
pits active employees against retired employees," Wood wrote in a letter to the 
board. "What we are committed to doing is finding a solution to a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the county's tax collector said the retirement board would have to 
use reserve funds to pay the $5 million it would cost for added benefits in the 
next fiscal year. That could eventually deplete the $42-million reserve account 
and force present employees to pay more toward their own retirement, Tax 
Collector Harold S. Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the tough choice of canceling the benefits or dipping into 
reserves, the retirement board decided to delay the vote for further study. 
</P>
<P>
 With a new budget year beginning July 1, the board acknowledged that it could 
not put the decision off much longer and set a special meeting for 9 a.m. 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma arose when stock market losses combined with declines in real 
estate value left the retirement fund without excess cash for the added 
benefits. The supplemental benefits, which are paid in addition to the 
employees' regular retirement payments, run as high as $280 a month for some 
retired workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But retirees argued that the county is overstating the problem. The county's 
retirement fund has a 5% reserve, even though state law requires only 1% to be 
set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fund is very, very healthy," said Ann Michalski, past president of the 
county Retired Employees Assn. Inc. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; TEPEE GIVES STUDENTS A FEEL FOR TRIBAL 
LIFE

<P>
 After studying Native American tribes for several months, students at Park 
View School in Simi Valley had a chance Monday to take a peek inside a replica 
tepee. 
</P>
<P>
 Set up in front of the school on Alexander Street, the 20-foot-tall canvas 
tepee greeted students in the morning as they arrived for school.Later, 9- and 
10-year-olds had a chance to tour the inside and view tomahawks, animal skins 
and other artifacts from tribes that lived in the Great Plains. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Michelle La Kose said the tepee, owned by parents of a Park View 
student, gave students a reference point for their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps them imagine what life was like," she said. "They feel like what 
they learned was important." JULIE FIELDS

THE TIME IS NOW FOR POLITICAL CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The time has come for the city of Ventura to move into the 20th Century 
politically and leave the city manager, council-elected-at-large form of 
government for a more democratic, paid full-time mayor and council members 
elected from districts in which they live. 
</P>
<P>
 The current system has allowed the at-large election of political hacks who 
have been promoted and financed by a radical political corporation that has an 
agenda to stop all economic growth and business expansion of the tax base in 
the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has gained population in the past 12 years of John Baker's city 
manager rule, and county sales tax revenues have tripled, new city fees 
imposed, more regulations, new taxes and assessments, higher water and service 
rates. Yet, the city of Ventura has lost over 35% share of tax revenues in the 
county because Baker, supported by the special-interest, no-growth political 
hacks, has made revenue-producing retail and other businesses flee the city and 
move to more business-friendly cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we rush out and hire a travel agent or a big government tax-and-spend 
city manager, the citizens and the business community should have a serious 
debate as to whether we will continue to have a "cow-town" form of government 
or one more reflective of the needs of the citizens and the community. If we 
choose to continue as we have, the future will mirror the past, shrinking tax 
base, unemployment, flight of capital and businesses, which in turn will mean 
more fees, more and higher taxes, new and higher assessments, more regulations 
that will only accelerate the sinking of the good ship VENTURA. 
</P>
<P>
 Methinks that John Baker is jumping ship just in time. Was he a great city 
manager or what?

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; CITY GETS 4 DEPUTIES TO FILL VACANCIES 
</P>

<P>
 Four Ventura County sheriff's deputies have been shifted to covering the city 
of Moorpark to fill vacancies left by those who were promoted or transferred to 
other positions in the department, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Deputy Tim Cowgill, a 14-year veteran who has worked in Camarillo and 
the County Jail, was moved to Moorpark to become patrol supervisor, Sgt. Keith 
Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark will also get two new patrol officers -- Deputy Jody Keller, a 
13-year veteran who has worked in the Custody Division, and Deputy Jerry Gomez, 
who completed patrol orientation in Moorpark after working for three years at 
the County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also transferred Deputy Larry Bull from Thousand Oaks to 
Moorpark, where he will work as a detective on the 22-member force, Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks said the department is still waiting for two patrol deputies to finish 
training so that they can fill vacancies in Moorpark that are being covered on 
an overtime basis by deputies from other details.

SCRAP THE RV PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I think Dorothy Ramirez and her so-called Citizens to Protect Port Hueneme's 
Future are doing a great disservice to our community by disseminating false and 
misleading information concerning the proposed RV park at Hueneme Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Her letter, which coincidentally made its way from Hueneme Road north, states, 
"The resort will bring in more than $400,000 per year."Apparently, Ms. Ramirez 
failed to consult the most recent edition of the city's new "Final Subsequent 
EIR," which projects $204,751 in its first year, not $400,000. That's half. 
</P>
<P>
 I attended a City Council meeting about one year ago where the former 
president of the California Travel Parks Assn., John Imler, whose group is a 
pro-RV advocacy organization, told our City Council that this project will lose 
nearly $200,000 in its first two years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe Ms. Ramirez and her cohorts attended this same meeting, along with 
me and my husband. Apparently, Dorothy has selective recall. Two weeks after 
Mr. Imler spoke to the City Council, city staff prepared a new report based 
upon Mr. Imler's analysis. Presumably, the Citizens to Protect Port Hueneme's 
Future were not privy to this important information that the project would make 
around $30,000 instead of $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad irony is that our city thinks that it has the skills to create and 
manage a profitable RV park. If we stopped the RV park, $2.6 million would be 
freed up right now to save our Police Department without raising our taxes. Now 
that makes dollars and sense.

FOES OF PORNOGRAPHY ATTEND MEETING TO OPPOSE MEASURE; VENTURA: THE CITY COUNCIL 
WAS EXPECTED TO DEBATE PROPOSAL LIMITING ADULT STORES. BUT BY LATE EVENING, THE 
HEARING HAD NOT BEGUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A law that would permit adult-oriented businesses to open only in Ventura's 
industrial districts was scheduled for debate late Monday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 A smattering of anti-pornography activists attended the meeting to oppose the 
proposed new law, but by late evening, the hearing had not begun. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the council, the ordinance would still require a second vote 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law would prohibit book and video stores specializing in pornographic 
materials, as well as other sexually oriented businesses, from locating within 
500 feet of a church, school, home or other area frequented by children. 
</P>
<P>
 That would limit the businesses to select city blocks, planners say. The 
ordinance favors locating adult businesses south of the Ventura Freeway, 
between Victoria and Arundell avenues, and a few smaller areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the meeting, most council members said they thought that the proposal 
was fair and well drafted and that they planned to vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents insisted that the law was a bad idea. "I would like a stronger 
ordinance," Ventura resident Ken Rose said. "I would think a total ban would be 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 The city cannot ban adult businesses entirely because that would violate 
owners' First Amendment constitutional rights, state and federal high courts 
have ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city Planning Commission, which approved the proposal last week, asked 
planners to research whether the city can order the businesses to be as little 
as 100 feet apart to avoid creating a red-light district that lures illicit 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members, however, said it might not be legal to further limit the 
sites available to adult businesses, because so few are acceptable under the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura city officials first considered an adult-oriented business law two 
years ago, when residents and Main Street merchants raised a furor over the 
proposed opening of an adult business near the old Ventura County 
superintendent of schools office. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was powerless to halt the business because there were no laws 
prohibiting sexually oriented businesses. The business, which never opened due 
to public pressure, would have joined Three Star Books as Main Street's second 
adult-oriented business. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council soon approved a temporary ordinance banning all such 
businesses except the existing one while city planners researched the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance affects only future businesses and exempts Three Star Books. 
Merchants neighboring Three Star Books say the business has been low-key and 
discreet. 
</P>
<P>
 Some business owners in the industrial sites south of the freeway, where new 
adult-oriented businesses could open, said the proposed law is not an issue for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Many run warehouses or other types of businesses that do not rely on much foot 
traffic and do not attract children.

BUYER'S MARKET; THOUSAND OAKS TO HELP FAMILIES BUY HOMES THEY'RE RENTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every time he paid the rent for his two-bedroom condominium, Rodrigo Flores 
got the uneasy feeling that he was tossing away money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than padding a landlord's wallet, he wished that he could be investing 
in his future. But with a wife and three children to support, Flores could 
never seem to save enough cash for a down payment on a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he doesn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' new Ownership Assistance Program, launched last month, will 
soon help Flores and other lower-income families buy the homes that they've 
been renting for years. 
</P>
<P>
 With deferred, low-interest loans, the city can offer renters enough quick 
cash to cover down payments and closing costs. A federal mortgage loan takes 
care of the rest, turning longtime renters into first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying so hard to qualify for some kind of a loan, but we could 
never raise enough money," said Flores, a machine shop worker. "We really 
appreciate the city doing this for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The program has already attracted more than a dozen applications, even though 
it's available in just one area -- the Las Casitas condominium complex in 
Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Judy Lazar will present a progress report on the program at 
tonight's council meeting, and she's planning a glowing account. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really about as affordable as you can get in this city," Lazar said. 
"This opportunity just doesn't exist elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Ownership Assistance Program, low-income renters buying their first 
house can qualify for city loans amounting to up to 10% of the purchase price. 
The loan accumulates no interest -- and participants make no payments -- for 
five years. After that, the loans carry interest rates of 3% to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 A staff report on the program last month indicated that officials would give 
priority loans to families who meet household-size guidelines -- no more than 
four people for a typical two-bedroom Las Casitas condo. But in practice, 
mortgage brokers have encouraged everyone to apply. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-member Flores family, for example, has easily qualified for the loan 
program and the final paperwork will be signed soon. "Now we won't be throwing 
away money -- we're saving it, investing it," Flores said, leaning back on his 
sofa, under a wall covered with family photos. 
</P>
<P>
 With Las Casitas condominiums on sale for about $75,000 apiece, most renters 
find ownership astoundingly affordable. Mortgage payments and homeowners fees 
total $600 to $800 a month usually, just slightly more than rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll pay more (per month), but like my mom says, it'll be mine," said Janine 
Jones, an insurance clerk who has applied for the program. "I've got to look at 
the long picture." 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 years of living at Las Casitas, Jones has witnessed a fair share of the 
problems that plague the neighborhood, a 540-unit condominium tract wedged 
between the Ventura Freeway and Hillcrest Drive just west of Ventu Park Road. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has seen a condominium in her neighborhood stuffed with two dozen 
people and crawling with cockroaches. She's watched uncaring tenants trash 
their homes and clog the streets with parked cars. And she's called police to 
break up ear-splitting parties. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she has also seen major improvements, and she is determined to 
stick around. 
</P>
<P>
 By encouraging renters to buy, Jones thinks that the Ownership Assistance 
Program will boost Las Casitas' image. Now, nearly two-thirds of the 
neighborhood's residents rent their homes, and property values have sagged to 
record lows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to clean it up somehow," Jones said. "Hopefully, this program will 
improve the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she added: "It's probably my only chance to buy, with housing prices 
so low. I've got to jump at the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasm for the city's program runs especially high among Las Casitas' 
resident homeowners, who believe that renters tend to be less active in 
neighborhood affairs and less concerned about keeping up their property. 
</P>

 "Our homeowners association has been saying for years that Las Casitas is the 
best value in the Ventura County region," said Robert Bickle, president of the 
group. "It's not a sweltering pit of despair or anything like that. It can be a 
nice place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next month, the Ownership Assistance Program will be open only to Las 
Casitas renters. By early summer, other Thousand Oaks residents will get a 
crack at the city loans. And this fall, if any of the $1.45 million set aside 
for the program remains, even non-Thousand Oaks residents will be allowed to 
apply for funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the real estate market stopped back in 1988, it was because we priced 
first-time buyers out," realtor Sammie Gerber said. "This is just a really 
great program for first-time buyers. It's a good place for them to start."

HEAVILY ARMED MAN, POLICE IN STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A heavily armed Port Hueneme man took his wife and a woman neighbor hostage 
about 6:15 p.m. Monday, prompting a barricade by dozens of police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, described as a former police officer from Cleveland in his late 40s, 
had fired no shots by 10:30 p.m., and police said the neighbor had escaped and 
the wife had been released. 
</P>
<P>
 Police initially responded to a warning call by the man's psychiatrist, who 
told police that the man had weapons in his Ventura Road apartment, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Port Hueneme police tried unsuccessfully to contact the man, they 
descended on the Anacapa View apartment complex near Hueneme Road with the 
Oxnard Special Weapons and Tactics team. 
</P>
<P>
 By 7 p.m., the neighbor had escaped from the two-story dwelling near the 
ocean. The man released his wife unharmed about 10:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they did not know the motive. By late evening, police still had 
not spoken to the man and were planning an assault on his home. 
</P>
<P>
 All streets near the complex were barricaded, including Ventura and Hueneme 
roads and Sea View Street. 
</P>
<P>
 At least a dozen apartments in the man's complex were evacuated.

CITY COUNCIL TO WEIGH EARTHQUAKE RELIEF SPENDING; THOUSAND OAKS: WHETHER TO 
GIVE PRIORITY TO CITY-OWNED OR PRIVATE PROPERTY IS AT ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Council members will decide tonight how to spend a $500,000 
earthquake relief fund, debating whether to emphasize repairing city-owned 
masonry walls or helping residents rebuild their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thousand Oaks suffered far less damage than neighboring Simi Valley, 
at least two dozen residents have applied for city aid, claiming that Federal 
Emergency Management Agency grants cannot cover their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund, an emergency allocation from the federal Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, can be used to repair city structures or help residents of 
any income group. 
</P>
<P>
 Within those broad guidelines, council members have so far been unable to 
agree on exactly how the half-million dollars should be allocated. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff recommendation calls for devoting $125,000 to help any residents 
with household repairs not covered by insurance or other federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $245,000 would be spent on repairing masonry walls, inspecting 
reservoirs for damage, and boosting disaster preparedness by buying emergency 
supplies and educating residents. The final one-fourth of the grant would 
remain in a contingency fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation to set aside just $125,000 for immediate housing rehab 
loans angered Mayor Elois Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe this report -- I'm very disappointed with it," Zeanah said. 
"Staff is placing a priority on perimeter walls, even though the council's 
clear direction was to focus on the residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Alex Fiore, however, said he considered the funding distribution 
"fair and reasonable." Tilting or unstable walls could topple on passersby, he 
said, so the damaged masonry endangers all Thousand Oaks residents. Individual 
home repairs, by contrast, would help only one family at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general public walks along those sidewalks, and one of these walls could 
come down and hurt someone," Fiore said. "We should use a substantial amount of 
that money to repair perimeter walls." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating just such a clash, City Manager Grant Brimhall has labeled his 
staff's recommendation "very squishy" and subject to change. Further, he has 
proposed appointing an ad-hoc committee of Fiore and Zeanah to come up with a 
more detailed spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But forming a committee would mean yet another delay to residents who have 
already squeezed every possible penny out of state and federal agencies and 
still cannot come up with the cash to repair peeling plaster or replace prized 
crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months after the Northridge quake, Dan and Sharon Gerlach still anxiously 
await word on whether the city can help them cover more than $30,000 in damage 
to their home. 
</P>
<P>
 They're frustrated at the time lapse and annoyed at the staff report's 
emphasis on treating the city's poorest residents the most generously. The 
recommendations call for low-income senior citizens or disabled residents to 
receive grants. All others would get only loans, with interest rates from 4% to 
6%, depending on household income. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have to be handicapped, have to be low-income, have to be elderly (to 
get grants), you have to go through so many gates," said Dan Gerlach, an 
electrical engineer. "I would hope the city would relax their requirements to 
allow more people to qualify for money. And citizens should be a higher 
priority than retaining walls." 
</P>
<P>
 The application process will require elaborate screening as city officials 
scrutinize documentation of FEMA and state loans, private insurance coverage 
and other assistance programs. Officials have not yet decided whether to follow 
the lead of Simi Valley, where the City Council must review each application. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it's possible to disburse the money faster -- the first three people 
who sign up could get it all -- but we need to be fiscally responsible," 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "It's not that we don't trust people, but we need 
to verify that they really have no other source of funding available." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some applicants, eager as they are for city help, understand the need for 
laborious cross-checking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forrest and Jacque Frields, for example, are counting on some city loans to 
help them cover the deductible on their earthquake insurance policy, which 
exceeds $21,000. Yet they're willing to wait out the application process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time the government gives out taxpayers' money, you've got to be sure you 
know where it's going," said Forrest Frields, a planning commissioner and local 
photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple this week leased a new house for six months while they await word 
on whether a cracked foundation and split roof beams will force demolition of 
their quake-battered home. Whatever the verdict, repairing the house will take 
months and cost about $100,000 -- and their private insurance doesn't cover the 
whole tab. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in a recession for four years," Forrest Frields said. "We've 
tapped our savings already. We're going to have to ask the city or FEMA for 
help."

PLANNER RESIGNS OVER LANDSCAPE CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura planning commissioner abruptly resigned Monday evening after the 
City Council instructed him to either step down from his city post or refuse to 
accept a Redevelopment Agency contract for his landscape-architecture firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis D. Stiles announced his resignation from the Planning Commission at a 
council meeting after council members, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, told 
him to choose between his public service and private business. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members had decided 6 to 1 that Stiles could either continue to serve 
or accept a $23,000 contract for landscaping at a downtown plaza. Councilman 
Jim Monahan cast the dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford warned that the primary concern is "cronyism. Those on the 
inside get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Then to council members' surprise, Stiles suddenly said he was both resigning 
his post and withdrawing his contract proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing regret that they had perhaps spoken too harshly, council members 
approved Stiles' landscaping contract for the plaza at the south end of 
California Street near the beach promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we could admit that maybe we were a little harsh here," Councilman 
Greg Carson said.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: HERE'S THE SCOOP; BRACE YOURSELF: THE ICE CREAM 
WARS ARE HEATING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you don't like ice cream, you're going to hate this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer is to ice cream sales what winter is to sales of chicken noodle soup. 
About half of all the ice cream and frozen yogurt sold this year will be dished 
out over the next four months. 
</P>
<P>
 And following three years of virtually flat sales, ice cream makers are 
mounting a massive effort to whip up excitement in the $11-billion industry. On 
tap are gobs of new products, stepped-up marketing efforts and a few oddball 
items resurrected from the ice cream graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an utter free-for-all," said Jerry Dryer, a food industry consultant who 
specializes in the dairy industry. "There's still not one true national brand 
of ice cream out there. But everyone thinks they can be just that." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Ben & Jerry's has unleashed its first-ever national ad campaign, 
featuring such 1960s social activists as Bobby Seale, co-founder of the Black 
Panther Party, eating vanilla ice cream. Baskin-Robbins, struggling to bolster 
its staid reputation, is about to break its biggest-ever ad campaign. And this 
line in a Haagen-Dazs TV spot, showing a couple in a suggestive bedroom scene, 
implies that eating its ice cream is better than sex: "At 11:30 at night, 
there's one thing better than sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, advertising can't solve one of the industry's biggest problems: how to 
simultaneously appeal to health-conscious consumers and lovers of 
calorie-laden, chunk-filled brands. The ice cream kings are agonizing over 
whether Americans will increasingly turn to more health-conscious products like 
nonfat yogurts and sorbets, or continue to pay two bucks a scoop for an 
ever-broadening batch of super premium products. 
</P>
<P>
 So, they are churning out more of everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite several years of flat sales, industry consultants expect the improving 
economy and an array of new products to help boost sales 5% or more this year. 
This optimism has helped to trigger the new marketing campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, there is concern among industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers are not consistent," said Jeff Reiter, senior editor at Dairy Foods 
magazine. "During the week they might want fat-free frozen yogurt, but on the 
weekend they may splurge with a double-scoop of chocolate-chip cookie dough." 
</P>
<P>
 This has left everyone mimicking everyone else. Baskin-Robbins is stealing a 
page from Ben & Jerry's book with a new line of frozen yogurt filled with 
chunks of fruit and candy. Haagen-Dazs is testing to see if consumers will buy 
its fruit-flavored sorbet at the supermarket. And Ben & Jerry's has finally 
introduced a "smooth, no chunks" line as its belated admission that, to stay 
alive in the ice cream business, you'd better sell a lot of no-frills chocolate 
and vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the usually stodgy Dairy Queen chain is repackaging and reintroducing its 
Mr. Misty drinks as Misty Slushes. "We're getting gender-sensitive here," 
explained Gary See, vice president of marketing at International Dairy Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, just as some are adding chunks to their ice cream, others are 
adding lines without them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ice cream is really about childhood," said Carol Moog, a psychologist and ad 
consultant. "But if your ice cream is all filled with too many chunks and other 
hardware, it loses the essence of its sensuality." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Ben & Jerry's says it is introducing its chunk-free line for a more 
practical reason: more than 25% of all ice cream sold is vanilla. And while 
supermarkets were happy to stock Ben & Jerry's chunky flavors, few wanted to 
carry their vanilla or chocolate flavors, said Holly Alves, marketing manager 
at Ben & Jerry's. To convince grocers that it is serious about vanilla and 
chocolate, Ben & Jerry's decided to build an entire line around the flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the toughest things was figuring out names for the new flavors. After 
all, Ben & Jerry's has built its reputation concocting crazy names for its ice 
creams, like Cherry Garcia and Chunky Monkey. Among the names it considered for 
the smooth vanilla: Thrilla Vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
 The company finally decided to play it straight and simply call it vanilla. 
"While everyone is trying to come up with Ben & Jerry's names for their ice 
creams, we decided to call them what they are," Alves said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "smooth" line has not been a hot seller at the chain's 15 franchise 
stores in California, said Michael Gale, president of Los Angeles-based Ben & 
Jerry's of California. The biggest seller these days is the nonfat yogurt being 
tested at its five Los Angeles stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben & Jerry's is also recycling a flavor that it scrapped years ago -- "White 
Russian," which, like the drink, is made with coffee, sweet cream and Kahlua. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, rival Haagen-Dazs is testing consumer response in Los Angeles to 
five new sorbet flavors sold at supermarkets. The sorbet, which it promotes as 
"0% fat, 100% Haagen-Dazs," tastes somewhat like a rich, fruit sherbet but 
contains no dairy ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen-Dazs figures the best way to boost sales is to make it available 
everywhere. So the company recently struck deals to have its products sold 
everywhere from special freezers at Blockbuster Video stores to room service 
menus at Hyatt hotels, spokesman Dave Gilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of watching Ben & Jerry's and Haagen-Dazs eat away at its market 
share, Baskin-Robbins is finally fighting back with an $18-million ad campaign. 
It features an eccentric "Wizard of Wonders" who concocts all sorts of new 
treats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just six weeks after its introduction, Cappuccino Blast, a sort of cappuccino 
milkshake, has emerged as Baskin-Robbins' most successful new product in a 
decade, said Larry Kurzweil, vice president of marketing for the Glendale-based 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 This month the firm is introducing "Yogurt Gone Crazy," a line of hard-scoop 
frozen yogurts. The yogurts are filled with chunky goodies and have Ben & 
Jerry-like names such as "Boom Choco Choco Laka" and "Raspberry Cheese Louise." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kurzweil is quick to point out that years before Ben & Jerry's existed, 
Baskin-Robbins was christening its new ice creams with silly names. 
</P>
<P>
 Way back in 1961, Baskin-Robbins called its peppermint with sunflower seed ice 
cream "Astronut." But perhaps most original of all, in 1972 it dubbed its 
caramel fudge ice cream "Here Comes the Fudge." Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles agency Asher/Gould Advertising has won the estimated 
$23-million anti-smoking ad account for the California Department of Health 
Services. Western International Media will continue to handle media buying. . . 
. The Santa Monica agency Suissa/Miller has picked up the creative portion of 
the estimated $54-million account for Jenny Craig. The San Francisco office of 
J. Walter Thompson will continue to handle media buying. . . . The Los Angeles 
office of Foote, Cone & Belding has won a portion of the $3-million account for 
Honolulu-based Kauai Advertising Group. Crop of the Cream 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the nation's ice cream, frozen yogurt and related products were 
sold at supermarkets in 1993. Although private label brands still lead all 
others in ice cream and frozen yogurt sales at the grocery store, they are 
slowly losing market share. Here are the top five supermarket brands over the 
past year*, ranked by sales in millions of dollars:

EDS HOLDING MERGER TALKS WITH SPRINT; TECHNOLOGY: THE PROPOSED DEAL WOULD 
REQUIRE GENERAL MOTORS TO SPIN OFF ITS COMPUTER SERVICES UNIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In yet another sign of affinity between the computer and the telephone, 
General Motors Corp. said Monday that its computer services unit, Electronic 
Data Systems Corp., is negotiating a merger with long-distance provider Sprint 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed "merger of equals," which would require GM to spin off EDS, would 
create a high-tech behemoth with $20 billion in annual revenue, 120,000 
employees and powerful communications and data processing capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 GM purchased EDS in 1984 for $2.5 billion from founder Ross Perot in a rare 
stroke of luck or foresight to modernize its information processing system. The 
unit is now valued by analysts at about $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the merger happen, GM would spin off EDS to holders of its Class E 
common stock, whose dividends are based on income from EDS. Terms of any merger 
with Sprint have yet to be agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, EDS and Sprint said the merger would strengthen their respective 
positions in existing markets while enabling them to tackle emerging multimedia 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combination is formidable," said Robert Clark, industry analyst at 
Dataquest Inc., a Silicon Valley market research company. 
</P>
<P>
 EDS is already a heavy user of telecommunications. EDS, for example, builds 
and operates computer systems that connect far-flung factories, dealers, 
offices and parts suppliers for companies such as GM and Xerox. 
</P>
<P>
 The company would use Sprint's state-of-the-art communications system to cut 
its phone costs and offer customers one-stop shopping. "Companies want a 
one-stop provider for all communications and information needs," EDS Chairman 
Les Alberthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint's network and broad customer base would also make it easier for EDS to 
reach millions of consumers with new services such as home shopping, video on 
demand, remote home automation and on-demand education, Alberthal said. The 
company already serves consumers by collecting and processing data from bank 
automated teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint, for its part, needs the cash and computer know-how to compete in the 
long-distance telephone business, where it is now a weak third behind AT&T and 
MCI Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combined ability to deliver information technology and telecommunications 
capability on a world level is not currently available," Sprint CEO William 
Esrey said in an announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 While telecommunications companies such as Sprint can transport information 
efficiently, says Ken Zita, partner at Network Dynamics Assn., a New York 
communications consulting company, they don't have the technology to connect 
varied computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In a major step in that direction, AT&T recently announced that it would 
develop systems to enable companies using Novell's popular local area network 
software to connect their various operations over long-distance lines. AT&T 
would, in effect, enable companies to create global private networks without 
having to hire systems integration providers such as EDS. AT&T has an edge in 
offering such services because of its computer subsidiary, NCR. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI, by contrast, is a step behind. Although it has been aggressively offering 
corporations communications services through its joint venture with British 
Telecom, it has yet to announce a strategic partnership that will enable it to 
offer more complex data communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint and GM cautioned that there are "significant issues to be resolved" 
before the merger goes ahead. GM, for example, said it needs Internal Revenue 
Service approval for a tax-free spinoff of EDS before it will go ahead with a 
deal.

USDA ABOLISHES CONTROVERSIAL CITRUS QUOTAS; AGRICULTURE: ACCUSATIONS OF 
CHEATING BY SUNKIST GROWERS AND OTHERS REPORTEDLY LEAD TO 'TURMOIL,' COSTLY 
LAWSUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a repudiation of the giant citrus cooperative Sunkist Growers, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture said Monday that it will abolish a scandal-ridden, 
Depression-era quota system that let growers keep oranges and lemons off the 
market to prop up prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The USDA said it took the action because accusations of widespread cheating on 
quotas by Sunkist and dozens of citrus growers and packers had led to "division 
and turmoil" within the California-Arizona citrus industry and dozens of costly 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's action is unlikely to bring immediate change in citrus prices 
or supplies. The quota system had been suspended since December, 1992, and the 
season just ending operated free of market constraints without radical changes 
in prices or per-acre revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the fact that the orange market didn't collapse "demonstrated that the 
industry could be profitable in a non-quota environment," said Rep. Calvin 
Dooley (D-Fresno), who tried unsuccessfully to forge a consensus among the 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was greeted euphorically by many independent growers and packers 
who had chafed under the cartel-like system, which they said rewarded 
inefficient growers and was controlled by Sunkist. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunkist, based in Sherman Oaks, had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-op, which markets citrus for its 6,500 members who grow two-thirds of 
California's citrus, has long contended that quotas are needed to prevent sharp 
swings in supply and price volatility to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard Rominger, a California farmer who is also deputy secretary of 
USDA, said that he notified Sunkist personally of the decision Monday. While 
"they may not have been happy . . . they were resigned to the fact that this is 
probably the only thing left to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government acted just a week before federal prosecutors were to go to 
trial in Fresno in a decade-old case against Sequoia Orange Co., a packinghouse 
that deliberately violated the quotas in the early 1980s to protest the system. 
</P>
<P>
 That case, which put the Justice Department in the position of prosecuting 
someone for growing too many oranges, was among more than 60 pending lawsuits 
triggered by the system -- including 19 filed by the government last year 
accusing Sunkist and several of its biggest growers and packers of cheating on 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Monday's action, the government dropped all those suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a progressive Democratic administration could tolerate being in 
the role of keeping food off the table," said James Moody, a Washington lawyer 
who has been instrumental in fighting such quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 Rominger stressed that the federal agency still favors marketing orders, of 
which production quotas are considered the most onerous part. Such orders also 
let growers act together to promote and market their products. 
</P>
<P>
 The USDA said it would consider a new proposal for a citrus marketing order if 
the industry could ever agree on one, and Rominger said Sunkist officials 
indicated they might make such a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Nelsen, president of California Citrus Mutual, a trade group for 850 
growers, said the association is scrambling to get a marketing order in place 
that could operate a statistical and crop forecasting service. Those functions 
were performed under the program being terminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics and supporters generally agreed that Sunkist will survive the USDA's 
action, though its 65% market share might fall. Sunkist's brand name and 
elaborate international marketing system still make it attractive to many 
smaller growers. 
</P>
<P>
 But without the quotas, some larger citrus growers and packers may decide to 
quit the cooperative, which would save them fees paid to Sunkist, and strike 
out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm jumping up and down," said Dennis Johnston, a third-generation citrus 
farmer in Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston said that in the past, he's had to sell as many as 75,000 40-pound 
boxes of navel oranges to juice makers, getting about 50 cents a box, because 
quotas prevented him from selling them as fresh fruit, for which he gets about 
$8 a box. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it'll let me ship the fruit when I decide to ship, and not the boys who 
sit on the (administrative) committee," said Johnston, referring to the 
Sunkist-dominated committee of growers and packers who run the quota system by 
allocating orders to growers. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will end after the expiration of a 60-day notice required by the 
1937 legislation that authorized marketing orders.DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

PLATINUM TO LAYOFF AS MANY AS 300 WORKERS; SOFTWARE: DESPITE $15-MILLION 
RESTRUCTURING EFFORT, ANALYST SAYS FIRM'S SURVIVAL CHANCES REMAIN QUESTIONABLE.

 Platinum Software Corp., whose top management was ousted last month amid 
allegations of accounting fraud, said Monday that it is going to shed as many 
as 300 employees, or more than a third of its work force, as part of a 
$15-million restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubled accounting software company, based in Irvine, also reduced its 
previously reported revenue for the past 15 months by $18.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum acknowledged last month that it had been reporting potential sales as 
actual revenue. Co-founder Gerald R. Blackie and three other executives 
resigned April 18 when the company revealed the accounting irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmelo J. Santoro, a Platinum board member who replaced Blackie as chief 
executive, said Monday that the company had to cut its costs to ensure its 
operating expenses are in line with its expectations of lower revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 300 affected workers, or 37% of the company's 820 employees, about 100 
will be laid off immediately, including as many as 35 at the company's Irvine 
headquarters, Santoro said. Another 200 employees will either be laid off later 
or will stay with operations that Platinum hopes to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is negotiating to sell several of its software lines by the end of 
the current quarter, Santoro said, so it can focus on its core accounting 
products. It hopes to sell its international sales organizations for Europe 
(except Britain), Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Phillips, analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York, called the 
restructuring a necessary step for Platinum, but the company's survival remains 
in question. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a precarious situation," he said. "They still have $17 million in 
cash, and that is enough to go forward. They are doing the things they need to 
do in order to keep going, like reassuring customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by a shareholder lawsuit, Platinum began reviewing its accounting 
procedures earlier this year. That resulted in the $18.2-million adjustment to 
earlier revenue figures. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75% of those sales, however, or about $13.6 million in revenue, probably 
will be booked in subsequent quarters, said Bruce Edwards, a Platinum board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's disclosure of the accounting irregularities triggered a probe by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. That investigation is continuing, 
Santoro said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 For its third fiscal quarter, which ended March 31, the company reported a 
loss of $13 million. That compared to a restated loss of $1.2 million for the 
same period a year earlier. Three-month revenue was $14.2 million, compared to 
restated revenue of $6.8 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's fourth fiscal quarter, which ends June 30, will include a charge 
of $15 million to cover costs of the restructuring. That total does not include 
any potential liability for shareholder lawsuits.

MEAD WILL SELL ITS LEXIS/NEXIS ON-LINE UNIT; DATA: THE SUBSIDIARY COULD DRAW 
BIDS OF UP TO $1 BILLION. PARENT COMPANY WANTS TO FOCUS ON CORE FOREST 
PRODUCTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Taking advantage of the frenzied appetite for on-line information, Mead Corp. 
put its Lexis and Nexis database services on the block Monday and said it 
intends to focus on its core business of forest products. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment analysts applauded the action, saying Mead had picked a good time 
to wrest strong value from a profitable venture, since competition in the field 
is heating up. They projected that Mead Data Central, the on-line service 
subsidiary, would draw bids of at least $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead has hired Goldman, Sachs & Co., a Wall Street investment firm, to 
evaluate how best to sell off the unit. Officials did not rule out a spinoff, 
but indicated that the logical step would be a sale to a "strategic buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the ideal time to unlock the value of the Lexis/Nexis franchise for 
the benefit of our share owners," said Steven C. Mason, chairman and chief 
executive of Mead, based in Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead, a leading maker of paper, pulp and packaging products, was founded in 
1846. It began its unlikely foray into the electronic information business in 
1968, when it paid $6 million for the company that would become Mead Data 
Central. For 1993, the unit posted earnings of $50.4 million on sales of $551 
million. The previous year, it made $50.6 million on sales of $495 million. The 
unit accounts for about 10% of Mead's business. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead Data Central's databases contain millions of legal and business documents 
and newspaper and magazine reports, retrieved by more than 300,000 clients over 
computers. Lexis, the more widely used of the two main services, is the legal 
research operation. Nexis provides general and business news. 
</P>
<P>
 Lexis/Nexis subscribers include law firms, courts, schools, accounting and 
public relations firms, corporations, brokerage houses and news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers said they expect potential buyers to queue up. "I'm sure 
right now there's a lot of salivating going on," said Maureen Fleming, editor 
of Information Industry Bulletin, a newsletter in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Among possible suitors, she mentioned University Microfilms Inc. of Ann Arbor, 
Mich.; Dow Jones News Retrieval, owned by the publisher of the Wall Street 
Journal; Dialog, a general, scientific and technical on-line service owned by 
Knight-Ridder, the newspaper company; Information Access Co., owned by 
Ziff-Davis Corp.; West Publishing Co., Mead's chief rival in the legal research 
field; Thomson Corp., a Canadian publishing company; Time Warner, owner of 
American Lawyer Group, and Times Mirror Co., publisher of The Los Angeles 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 One organization with a big stake in the outcome is the New York Times, which 
years ago granted Nexis the exclusive right to purvey its articles. As a 
result, the newspaper has been precluded from arranging lucrative contracts 
with other on-line services, such as America Online and Prodigy. But Fleming 
said she doubted that the New York Times would be inclined to pay the premium 
needed to buy Nexis and "get its rights back." The paper had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mead spokeswoman said the company decided to focus on forest products, an 
industry that has struggled in recent years, because "we're anticipating an 
up-cycle in the business again." 
</P>
<P>
 Mead shares rose $1.25 on Monday, to close at $44.50 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading.

 Wal-Mart's Numbers Up, Kmart's Down: Wal-Mart Stores reported higher quarterly 
earnings, widening its lead over No. 2 retailer Kmart Corp., which said its

retailer, said earnings for the first quarter rose to $498 million, or 22 cents 
a share, on sales of $17.7 billion, up from $451 million, or 20 cents a share, 
on sales of $13.9 billion a year earlier. At Kmart, first-quarter earnings from 
continuing operations fell to $18 million, or 4 cents a share, on sales of $7.8 
billion, down from $23 million, or 12 cents a share, on sales of $7.3 billion a

 Few Companies Offer Retiree Health Benefits: Most U.S. workers are left 
without health care benefits after they retire, a survey of employers 
found.Fewer than one in 10 small employers, defined as those with 500 or fewer 
employees, extended health coverage to their retirees in 1993, according to a 
survey by Foster Higgins, a New York-based benefits consulting firm. Among 
larger companies, 46% provided continuing health benefits to retiring workers. 
The survey also found that some companies that do extend benefits plan to end 
such coverage, while others plan to implement changes, such as requiring 
contributions from recipients and raising deductibles. The survey was based on 
responses from 2,395 companies.

 Survey Finds U.S. Business Leaders Optimistic: American business leaders grew 
more upbeat over the past six months and nearly three-quarters say their 
business will be better off in four years, according to a survey for Reuters 
and the "Nightly Business Report" by Yankelovich Partners Inc. The survey found 
that 72% of the business executives rate the economy in "fairly good" shape, up 
from just 46% in November. Seventy-one percent also said their companies will 
be better off by 1998, up from 56% in November.The survey of 366 executives at 
companies with more than $1 million in sales or revenue was conducted by 
telephone from April 27 to May 4 at a wide range of companies, based on 
interviews with presidents, chief executives or owners. The margin of error was 
5%.

 Hughes to Sell Satellite to Malaysia: The Far East nation today is expected to 
buy its first telecommunications satellite from Hughes Aircraft Co.Terms were 
not disclosed, but the HS 376 satellite -- to be built in El Segundo -- 
typically costs between $50 million and $100 million. It will provide Malaysia 
with direct satellite-to-home television broadcast capabilities. Hughes in the 
past two years has sold 12 satellites that serve the Far East, which is Hughes' 
fastest-growing market, said Steven D. Dorfman, president of the company's

AUTO PRODUCTION DECLINE HOLDS DOWN APRIL REPORT; ECONOMY: INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT 
ROSE FOR 11TH STRAIGHT MONTH BUT NOT AT LEVELS LIKELY TO SPUR INFLATION, 
EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A decline in auto production held back the nation's industrial output for 
April though it still rose for an 11th straight month. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's report by the Federal Reserve also showed factories operating at 
fairly high capacity but not, analysts said, at levels likely to spur rapid 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of what could be an important decision on interest rates, the Fed 
said industrial production rose a modest 0.3% last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The manufacturing advance was slowed by what analysts said was an inevitable 
cutback in auto and truck assembly lines from peak capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes things look a little weaker than they probably are," said economist 
Cynthia Latta of DRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting service. She 
said Detroit assembly lines "were running flat out so they couldn't increase." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of declining car production may be exaggerated in the April report, 
she said, because it usually is a big month for motor vehicle output and the 
government figures adjust for seasonal factors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Priscilla Trumbull of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the report 
still may be disappointing to manufacturers who were hoping for greater 
expansion in the current second quarter of the year after the disruptions of an 
extraordinarily difficult winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in a real fast-growth environment. But we are in a good growth 
environment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve also reported the operating rate at industrial companies 
held steady at 83.6% in April, maintaining the highest rate since it was 83.9% 
in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 That comes on the heels of earlier encouraging inflation news on Friday, when 
the government reported a small rise in consumer prices in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the latest calming figures, many analysts expect the Fed to boost 
short-term interest rates for the fourth time this year -- probably today when 
the central bank's policy-setting Open Market Committee meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that manufacturing output is still expanding at a pace 
deemed too fast by the Fed," said Carl Palash of MCM MoneyWatch in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 The factory output gain in April would have been more than 0.1% higher had it 
not been for a 2.9% drop in car and truck assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit had pushed production to near capacity in February -- the highest 
level in decades -- and was unable to achieve further gains normally expected 
in March and April, the Fed said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve said 12.5 million motor vehicles were assembled in April 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, down from 13 million in March and 13.9 
million the month before. 
</P>
<P>
 Before April, overall industrial production rose 0.5% for each of the three 
previous months. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in automotive production more than offset small gains in output of 
other consumer goods. All told, consumer goods declined 0.1% in April after 
increasing a like amount in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Gains in the output of fuels and clothing helped boost non-durable goods 0.3% 
despite a decrease in food production, after a 0.8% rise in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last at least three years, rose

 UAL Corp. Stock Decline Imperils Buyout: United Airlines' pilots are having 
second thoughts about a proposed employee buyout because the parent's stock is 
no longer valuable enough, the Air Line Pilots Assn. said in a recorded 
statement. The union noted that a clause in the agreement allows the unions to 
back out if UAL shares are trading below a specific price at the time the deal 
is to be closed.A Wall Street Journal article said the pilots want to change 
the terms of the buyout to reflect the stock's decline, but UAL wants no 
change. The airline's employees would get 53% of the company in exchange for 
concessions on wages and work rules and a financing package valued at $161 to 
$165 a share, the paper said. UAL closed at $117.75 a share on the NYSE, off 
$1.50

 Continental Expands 'Peanuts Fares': The airline, stepping up expansion of its 
no-frills, short-haul service, said it will offer unrestricted, low-cost 
"Peanuts Fares" on 292 more of its daily flights.The carrier also plans to hire 
up to 400 pilots in the next 12 months to keep up with its growing flight 
schedule. Houston-based Continental Airlines, the fifth-largest U.S. carrier, 
now employs about 4,000 pilots. "What you're seeing is only the beginning of 
what ultimately will be a revision of the industry's fare structure," said Tom 
Longman of Bear Stearns & Co.

U.S., JAPAN TO OPEN TRADE TALKS; PACIFIC RIM: IN EFFORT TO END STALEMATE, THE 
TWO COUNTRIES WILL TRY TO CLOSE GAP BEFORE A JULY SUMMIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and Japan will open exploratory trade talks Thursday in a 
drive to end their negotiating stalemate and strike a new economic deal, U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are scrambling to close the trade gap before a July economic 
summit, aware that their public agreement to disagree in February badly hurt 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 This led to Thursday's scheduled meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll explore whatever they will come up with," Kantor told reporters. "We 
have not re-engaged (the trade negotiations) but we are exploring various 
options that the Japanese seem to be bringing with them this week." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will expect a good and serious and far-reaching and far-ranging 
conversation, and we will explore every alternative," Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official said Japan's delegation would stay three or 
four days. The team is expected to include the vice-ministers of foreign 
affairs and trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are obviously hopeful that the talks will get back on track, but the 
ball's in their court," said the official, who requested anonymity. "We don't 
want to go down the track only to see it fail again. Our goal has not changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in the first glimmers of movement after three months of official 
limbo, the two sides agreed to try to find a way to resume their negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata said he would 
send vice ministers to probe the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa telephoned Kantor and said he would like to 
come in person to break the impasse, official sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor was reportedly receptive, although such a high-level meeting would 
depend on the outcome of Thursday's talks and on Kakizawa's fragile political 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 While the United States and Japan agree their $60-billion trade imbalance must 
be cut, they have parted ways over how. 
</P>
<P>
 The main bone of contention is the U.S. insistence on "objective criteria" to 
measure progress on opening Japan's markets, a stance that Tokyo dismisses as 
quotas in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two sides declared failure at their Feb. 11 White House summit, they 
opted to lie low for fear of a second public breakdown. The three-month hiatus 
has cost both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 For Japan, it has driven up the value of its currency; for Washington, it has 
helped boost interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets believe that without a concrete market access deal, the 
Democratic White House would try to "talk up" the yen to price Japanese exports 
out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's top economic adviser, Robert E. Rubin, insisted again 
Monday there is absolutely no U.S. strategy of suppressing the dollar against 
the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite reports that Clinton has toned down his demands from Japan, which is 
lurching from political crisis to crisis, Rubin said the President still wants 
a strong deal in line with last year's so-called framework accord.

PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE CONFIRMS FEDERAL SUBPOENA OF RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prudential Insurance Co. confirmed Monday that federal prosecutors have 
subpoenaed records relating to a real estate fund that may have overcharged its 
investors by up to $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential spokesman Robert DeFillippo said the U.S. attorney in Manhattan had 
subpoenaed records in February relating to the Prudential Property Investment 
Separate Account, known as Prisa, a real estate investment fund used mainly by 
big institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey-based insurance giant recently acknowledged that Prisa 
overvalued many of the properties it acquired by 10% or more and called on 
managers of the fund to resign. The firm also offered to reinstate a whistle 
blower, former Prudential executive Mark Jorgensen, whom Prudential had sued 
for making internal documents public. 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoenas, first reported Monday by the New York Times, indicate a 
broadening of the criminal investigation of Prudential, which initially focused 
mainly on limited partnership sales by the insurer's Wall Street brokerage 
subsidiary, Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 DeFillippo said that in February federal prosecutors subpoenaed Jorgensen's 
personnel file and a memo he had written to Prudential management complaining 
of alleged wrongdoing by Prisa managers. Last month, Prudential voluntarily 
turned over to prosecutors the results of two internal investigations that 
showed the properties had been overvalued, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Kenneth Vianale, who heads the Prudential investigation, 
has declined to comment on the subpoenas.

COMPANY TOWN; NBC FORGES A PARTNERSHIP WITH MEXICAN BROADCASTER; TELEVISION: 
THE NETWORK WILL ADVISE TV AZTECA ON PROGRAMMING, PROMOTIONS AND ADVERTISING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 NBC, which has been forging links with broadcasters around the globe, on 
Monday said it is forming an alliance with Mexican broadcaster Television 
Azteca. 
</P>
<P>
 A former state-owned TV company acquired by Grupo Azteca last year as part of 
the government's privatization program, TV Azteca is attempting to challenge 
Grupo Televisa, the powerful commercial broadcaster that controls 90% of the 
Mexican TV market. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC will forge a broad relationship with TV Azteca that will encompass a range 
of activities from adoption of the American network's famous peacock logo to 
advice for the Mexican broadcaster on programming, promotion and advertising. 
NBC has set up an "advisory management team" headed by Roger Ogden, president 
of NBC-owned KCNC-TV in Denver, to consult with TV Azteca. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC has a three-year option in which to invest in TV Azteca, but initially the 
role of the network will be largely advisory. 
</P>
<P>
 TV Azteca will also carry NBC-produced programming from the network's news, 
entertainment and sports divisions as well as programming supplied by its cable 
channel, CNBC, and Canal de Noticias, a Spanish-language TV news service 
launched by NBC earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 TV Azteca consists of two national networks, channels 7 and 13, which together 
reach a country of about 15 million TV homes. The total annual TV ad market in 
Mexico is about $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 For TV Azteca and NBC, however, cracking the fast-growing Mexican TV market 
will be an uphill battle. Under its new owners, TV Azteca has increased its 
share of the audience to 14% from 10%, but the market is still overwhelmingly 
dominated by Televisa, which has strong links both to the government and to 
advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Grupo Azteca was the dark horse victor that acquired TV Azteca last year for 
$640 million after a fierce bidding war against some of the country's biggest 
media moguls. Grupo Azteca, which is one of Mexico's largest consumer appliance 
retailers, bid $100 million more for the network than the runner up.  
</P>
<P>
 NBC and TV Azteca officials believe that by introducing aggressive 
American-style marketing, programming and promotion techniques at the network, 
it can attract as much as 20% to 25% of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's alliance with TV Azteca is part of the network's broader strategy of 
investing and teaming up with other emerging networks around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, NBC bought Super Channel, the London-based pan-European satellite 
service. In addition, NBC will shortly begin beaming its programming across 
Asia on the Apstar-2 satellite, and is expanding its ties with Newsvision in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 All three U.S. networks -- especially ABC -- are stepping up efforts to invest 
and forge alliances with overseas broadcasters as decades of state regulation 
end.

COMPANY TOWN; SCHWARZENEGGER'S 'CRUSADES' ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sources close to producer Carolco Pictures confirmed that the big-budget 
Arnold Schwarzenegger film "Crusades" has been postponed and may be revamped to 
lower its spiraling budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolco declined comment, but published reports have said that the budget of 
the film, to be directed by Paul Verhoeven, may have soared to more than $100 
million.The picture has been in pre-production. 
</P>
<P>
 The film was to have been released by MGM/UA under a distribution deal with 
Carolco that recently took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The film was to begin shooting this fall in Europe and North Africa, with 
Schwarzenegger portraying a knight. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolco, which produced Schwarzenegger's hit film "Terminator 2: Judgment 
Day," underwent a much-needed financial restructuring last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the company reported that its loss in the first quarter narrowed to 
$2 million from $6.8 million a year earlier, although revenue fell to $23 
million from $35.6 million in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
 A report in the Hollywood Reporter said that Schwarzenegger has been willing 
to take less than his typical salary -- more than $15 million these days -- and 
receive merchandising rights in lieu of the payments.

IT'S A 3-WAY RACE TO BUILD WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL JET ENGINE; AVIATION: 
ROLLS-ROYCE, PRATT & WHITNEY AND GE IN HEATED COMPETITION TO POWER NEW BOEING 
777.

 The cavernous building is nicknamed "the cathedral," with two 46-foot doors 
that weigh 80 tons each, but outside is where things are supposed to be as 
quiet as the proverbial church. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Rolls-Royce PLC tests jet engines, perched high among scaffolding 
designed like the strut of an airplane wing. It is a high-decibel, 
china-rattling exercise, as anyone who lives near an airport runway knows. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cathedral, a huge modern test bed, is designed to contain the noise 
and prevent Rolls-Royce's neighbors from hearing the rumble of aviation history 
in the making. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolls-Royce is running against U.S. rivals Pratt & Whitney and General 
Electric in a three-way race to build the world's biggest jet engines: monsters 
that in testing have delivered more than 100,000 pounds of thrust, a 
measurement of lifting power. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get one of those and it will just about put you into space," said Dean 
Breest, a London-based spokesman for Delta Air Lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost anyway. NASA's first manned Mercury flights in 1961 were powered by 
engines with a little less thrust, at 78,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The new jet engines, which can be fatter than the cabin of a 757 jetliner, 
will be used to power the new Boeing 777 scheduled to start test flights in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 The 777s are envisioned by Boeing and some airlines as the airplane of the 
future, serving long-haul routes throughout the Pacific on two engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Twin-engine economy has already taken over the Atlantic on routes such as 
Chicago-Manchester that were unheard of in the days when four-engine 747s ruled 
the skies between America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, carriers might use four of the big engines to power "super-jumbos" 
that could carry up to 800 passengers, assuming the idea ever makes it past the 
blueprint stage. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, the engines need to be proven. As the manufacturers test things, 
they are fighting hard for market share. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bloody war out there; it's not just competition," said John Sandford, 
managing director of the aerospace group at Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are high. 
</P>
<P>
 GE is spending about $1.5 billion to develop its GE90 engine. Rolls-Royce is 
spending about $1 billion on its Trent series of engines. Pratt is spending 
$500 million to create the PW4084. 
</P>
<P>
 Big price tags, but the payoff could be enormous in a market that should 
thrive well into the early 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt has taken the early lead in the race, with firm orders to outfit 66 
Boeing 777s with its PW4084 and 59 options for later purchases. GE reports 44 
orders and 28 options for the GE90. Rolls-Royce has 29 orders and 18 options 
for its Trent 800. 
</P>
<P>
 The engine makers are trying to woo Korean Airlines, expected to be the next 
purchaser this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The engines cost airlines around $10 million or more apiece, and the 
manufacturers estimate airlines will buy $60 billion worth over the next two 
decades. When sales of parts and repair work is included, this business could 
be well more than $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although engine makers are always tinkering around to improve their product, 
the market development manager for GE Large Engines, Vince DioGiovanni, said 
it's unusual to have three big companies all trying to pioneer a new type of 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
 This leads to lots of bold claims about how your engine is doing and how the 
other guy has problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Before an important air show this winter, Rolls-Royce proclaimed it had set a 
world record by running an engine at 106,000 pounds of thrust. Before long, GE 
claimed to have beaten that with 110,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt, which has tested its biggest engines at around 103,000 pounds, says 
such grand claims must be qualified, particularly since the engines now sold 
will need thrust only in the 80,000- to 90,000-pound range. 
</P>
<P>
 An engine running at 110,000 pounds thrust in cold weather would be hitting 
only about 80,000 pounds on an 80-degree day, said Tom Harper, program manager 
for Pratt's PW4000 engine series. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at Rolls-Royce and Pratt freely discuss a GE90 engine that failed 
during a test flight, forcing the pilot to land using his other engines. GE 
responds with details of a Pratt engine that fell off during testing. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a bit of mud has been slung, the engine makers acknowledge that 
their rivals are making good products and problems are to be expected during 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've all got about the same thing -- one may have a gnat's whisker 
over the other," Sandford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slight differences, however, add up over thousands of flight hours and years 
of use. Fuel, parts and maintenance end up costing much more than the engine 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most fundamental difference between all of us is the strategy by which we 
approach the size of the engine," said Tom Harper, program manager for Pratt's 
PW4000 engine series. 
</P>
<P>
 GE is taking the biggest gamble, designing a new engine the company claims 
will be more fuel efficient and more easily modified to handle higher thrust 
levels in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt, swayed by low oil prices, has come up with an engine that burns 
slightly more fuel but is touted as needing less maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolls-Royce boasts of a triple-shaft design that keeps its engine smaller than 
the others, although the thrust level can be increased by merely reprogramming 
computer software. 
</P>
<P>
 The engine makers all claim the competition's product will be more difficult 
to retool for different uses in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing won't take sides in the debate, letting airlines decide which engine 
they want. 
</P>
<P>
 For the engine maker, it is vital to get customers from the beginning. Once an 
airline starts buying a certain class of engine, it is virtually hooked on 
repeat orders because its mechanics will know how to work on that type of 
engine and parts and engines can be easily swapped around the aircraft fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, engines are becoming more reliable and staying on planes longer these 
days. Twenty-five years ago, it was considered good to keep an engine on the 
wing for 1,000 hours of service. The parts might be replaced within about seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some engines stay in use as long as 20,000 hours or more without removal 
for major maintenance, and they can last many more years. Rolls-Royce boasts of 
one engine that stayed on the wing of a Delta jet for more than 25,000 hours -- 
a record.

MAKING SURE ENGINES WIN IN AERIAL BATTLES WITH BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If a jet engine can't stand up to a 2.5-pound duck, its manufacturer has a 
multimillion-dollar turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Airplanes sometimes hit birds, and one or two sucked through a jet engine can 
cause disaster if it can't keep working. 
</P>
<P>
 This means the world's top jet engine makers must perform some gory testing to 
make sure the inevitable confrontations between bird and airplane will be fatal 
only to the bird. 
</P>
<P>
 It may sound crude, but experts say there is just one perfect way to do this: 
Fire carefully weighed dead birds into running engines and then check for 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The trials are called "bird ingestion." Pratt & Whitney tested its new PW4084 
engines with both a big bird, an 8-pound turkey, and four 2.5-pound ducks. The 
bird carcasses are shot through an air cannon into the spinning engine blades. 
</P>
<P>
 A slow-motion film of the larger bird shows the carcass flying toward the 
blades, which slice it into seven pieces as the engine consumes it. After the 
ducks are shot into the engine at about 170 miles an hour, tufts of feathers 
blow out the back. 
</P>
<P>
 The company obtained birds that had died of natural causes at poultry farms, 
spokesman Mark Sullivan said. As long as the birds are humanely killed, the 
practice seems to raise concerns only among the most vocal of animal rights 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that reduces the number of air accidents has got to be a good 
thing," said Derek Niemann, a spokesman for the Royal Society for the 
Protection of Birds in England. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as jet engine makers use different design philosophies, they seem to 
favor different types of birds. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Aircraft Engines tried out its GE90 engine on a herring gull. At 
Rolls-Royce in England, humanely killed ducks are fired from the cannon at the 
Trent series of engines, a spokesman said.

E=MC SQUARES ARE REALLY LIVING IT UP; AGING: A STUDY SAYS SCIENTISTS TEND TO 
LIVE LONGER THAN THE REST OF US. IT SEEMS THE SOCIAL GRACES THAT MANY OF THEM 
ADMIT THEY LACK MAY NOT BE SO HEALTHY AFTER ALL.

<P>
 If it were a movie, it would probably be called "Nerds: The Ultimate Revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 A new study spanning nearly 70 years suggests that, all else being equal, 
scientists live longer than non-scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The anachronistic image of socially impaired, slide-rule-toting chess masters 
has plagued legions of scientists, but their tendency to be less gregarious 
than others may give them the last laugh, says UC Riverside researcher Howard 
Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The findings do bode well for attracting the brightest scholars into 
science," says the Harvard-educated psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have scientific proof yet," he says, "but what this (study) may mean 
is that scientists have less stress. Perhaps they have found the right career 
niche for their interests and personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, sociability has been naturally associated with long and healthy 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a great deal of speculation and some evidence to predict that 
sociable people should live longer," Friedman says. "And at first, it looked 
like that would be the outcome here. Happily for scientists, we found just the 
opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Friedman's study, non-scientists are 26% more likely to die at 
any given age than scientists. In a sample of 600 men born around 1912, 
Friedman's group found that only 67% of non-scientists were still alive by age 
70, compared to 72% of the scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With funding from the National Institute on Aging, Friedman tracked the lives 
-- and deaths -- of a group of California youngsters first identified as gifted 
in 1922. That is the year legendary Stanford University psychologist Lewis 
Terman began his seminal behavior study of 1,528 children in Los Angeles and 
San Francisco public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Terman originally set out to answer the question "Are scientists different?" 
But, according to Friedman, Terman was never interested in the differences in 
their longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to see if bright people turned out to be nerdy and sickly," 
Friedman says. "There was a stereotype at the turn of the century that bright 
kids were weird, and Terman wanted to see if they grew up to be well adjusted 
and successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Troubled by the hunt for Communist sympathizers among American intellectuals, 
Terman returned to the study in the 1950s in hopes of explaining the growing 
friction between non-scientists -- specifically politicians and lawyers -- and 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Terman questioned 284 of the children who had grown up to be scientists and 
queried another 326 who did not. (All of the subjects in the second survey were 
white males; very few girls or ethnic minorities became scientists in those 
days.) 
</P>
<P>
 Terman discovered two trends among the groups. First, and predictably, he 
found that the scientists were more interested in science than those who went 
on to become businessmen or lawyers. Second, the scientists -- both as children 
and adults -- rated themselves and were rated by others as less sociable than 
most. 
</P>
<P>
 Using death certificates and interviews with survivors, Friedman's team was 
able to find out what happened to nearly all of Terman's subjects. Looking at 
causes of death, as well as health-related behaviors, the Riverside research 
team found that even early predictors of longevity seemed not to apply to 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Friedman, the team includes a biostatistician, epidemiologist, 
developmental psychologist, a pair of health psychologists and a physician. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that people who live longer are not excessive drinkers or smokers. 
But even this seems not to be true with the scientists whose lives we studied," 
says Friedman, who also found no difference in the death rates of obese 
scientists versus obese non-scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only speculate wildly on what all this means," Friedman says. "Clearly, 
we need to go back again to the sample and look at marriage patterns, hobbies, 
everything about the way these people lived their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is a whole body of anecdotal history about the long and lonely lives of 
socially awkward scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Edison, who died at 84, was no wallflower when it came to the world of 
inventions. But don't look for any sweet remembrances about life with this 
father.  
</P>
<P>
 Not only was Edison too busy in the laboratory to spend time with his children 
or grandchildren, he also paid scant attention to either of his wives or any of 
the people who wanted to be his friends.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, according to his biographers, Edison was so antisocial that he 
considered his deafness a blessing. He said it made it easier for him to 
concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Einstein was more outgoing and, especially around World War II, quite 
politically active. He adored classical music, the violin, and his first 
cousin, whom he married after divorcing his first wife. He died at 76. 
</P>
<P>
 But even he preferred the company of formulas and theorems to that of 
mathematicians and physicists. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Einsteins of today are as likely to be orbiting in space ships as 
they are to be bent over a microscope, the scientific personality remains 
somewhat aloof, say some students of behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "The value of our findings about scientists' longevity," Friedman says, "will 
come from identifying what it is that makes them a breed apart and why they 
seem to thrive on it."

 I've often thought that people ought to be salaried just for what they have to 
put up with. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone operators would make a bundle. Teachers would get a king's ransom. 
Writers could live like rock stars. Charles Barkley and Madonna would need food 
stamps. And Freddie Obidiah Castello III would pull in six figures a year, 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Castello's life has been about as simple as Whitewater. He's a father, a 
devout Catholic, failed player of the stock market, would-be inventor, former 
New Orleans postal worker, self-declared disciple of J. Paul Getty and Howard 
Hughes, aspiring poet/novelist/screenwriter and Sherman Oaks resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is to say, he lives all over Sherman Oaks: in parking garages, on bus 
benches, behind bushes -- wherever you're not likely to get murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 And one more item belongs on Castello's grab-bag resume -- tonight at 7 he 
will host his own public-access TV show, "Graffiti Bridge," named after the 
album. He carefully saved the $35 you need to buy a half-hour of studio time at 
Century Cable in Santa Monica. The purpose? To talk to kids about completing 
school and setting high goals. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. A homeless guy spending his paltry bucks for his own TV 
platform, so he can tell kids to live right. A homeless homeless guy, at that. 
Since the Northridge earthquake, Castello's been afraid to sleep in the Ventura 
Boulevard parking garage that was home for about four months. ("It was a safe 
place -- it was underground, it was free from the rain. And the people who 
worked in the building, they knew me by name.") He's a nomad again. 
</P>
<P>
 I first saw this looming, handsome gentleman months ago, standing near Ventura 
and Sepulveda boulevards, audaciously suggesting to haggard, barely collected 
drivers that they "smile." Some gave him the finger. Some smiled. Some turned 
to their companions and said, "In the words of Art Linkletter, 'people are 
funny!' " I decided to talk to him the other day because of the cardboard sign 
he was holding: 
</P>
<P>
 "HOMELESS WRITER -- PLEASE HELP -- GOD BLESS." 
</P>
<P>
 I like to think I'm a writer, and I sometimes feel a bit too much pecuniary 
affinity with homeless people. We talked for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say, 'Are you really a writer?' " he said. "What the hell is 
a writer supposed to look like? All writers are supposed to live in Bel-Air, 
right? Well, I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Castello told me many things. He's trying to patent a newspaper dispenser. 
He's kept a daily diary since 1981. He's got copyrighted original scripts and 
novels about two harrowing aspects of U.S. life: the postal service and the 
streets. He goes Downtown to buy socks and underwear ("You can get six or seven 
pair of socks for $5!"), but usually steers clear because "it's too dangerous, 
man." He gets fresh lettuce from a Dumpster at a nearby market, salad dressing 
from fast-food joints, and makes "good salads" (with a cucumber, if he has a 
spare 30 cents). He doesn't get sick "much" because "they throw oranges and 
apples in the Dumpster every day, man -- I know about the importance of getting 
my Vitamin C." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people yell "get a job" at him from passing BMWs and Range Rovers. 
His response: "Yeah, right! You got one for me?" For the moment, he sweeps out 
a local print shop for the money to rent a storage space for his clothes, 
typewriter and scripts. Some mornings, before customers arrive, the shop owners 
let him type for an hour or two: a poem, a script, a letter to his 10-year-old 
son in New Orleans (which includes, when possible, a few dollars). 
</P>
<P>
 He calls the people who stop to give him a buck, or a sandwich, his 
"customers." Self-deceptive euphemism? No. Just a guy keeping his pride. For 
every item generously offered, Castello returns a photocopy of one of his 
original weekly poems, and a photocopied "article of the week," thoughtfully 
chosen from a magazine (like an informative piece about the safety of eating 
fish, from American Health magazine). 
</P>
<P>
 Like a fool I didn't know, didn't care about the next turn  
</P>
<P>
 The bell is ringing, and still I don't know  
</P>
<P>
 why I'm here, having done nothing . . .  
</P>
<P>
 -- excerpt from his poem-of-the-week of late March, "The Ringing of the Bell." 
</P>
<P>
 "See, I grew up Catholic, man," said Castello, in freshly laundered blue 
jeans, black T-shirt and green canvas jacket ("I'm not filthy, man"). "My 
parents, along with my Catholic upbringing, always taught me never to ask for 
something I don't need, and if I do, try to put something back into the system. 
So I'm doing that by giving some of my poetry. . . . And I try to keep people 
informed." 
</P>
<P>
 The TV show, which he plans to do again in June, is another effort to "put 
something back." 
</P>
<P>
 "One student showed up (for the taping). And we talked about the importance of 
going to college and about graffiti," said Castello, standing on a busy Sherman 
Oaks corner near his shopping cart/mobile home. "I never went to college." 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a less-troubled time, Castello says, he was a 
fresh-out-of-high-school, 19-year-old, $18,000-a-year letter sorter for a post 
office in New Orleans, with sights set high: 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be like Howard Hughes," he said. "If not Howard Hughes, then J. 
Paul Getty, because they were two of the tops. I wanted $800 million, man, 
that's what I wanted. Seriously. Like they say, well, if you reach for that, 
even if you fall halfway, you'll still wind up with a hundred million or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead he wound up with $40,000 savings invested in stocks. When a broker 
suggested he borrow against it to make a greater investment, Castello smelled 
fortune, and went for broke. Which is exactly how he wound up. The year was 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so naive and so determined to make this thing work, and I believed in 
it so much," he said, "that I had told everybody, yeah, I'm going to be a 
millionaire next year, and this post office is going to kiss my little 
so-and-so. And it didn't work out that way. And everybody was looking at me 
like, yeah, we knew you wasn't going to make it, you ain't nothing but a loser. 
So that tore me down. I lost my girlfriend. So then you've got to look at these 
people every day. . . . Then I started drinking more. Because I was always a 
drinker. I just couldn't take that. So I became fed up with myself. It wasn't 
other people. I felt it was just human. They weren't doing nothing to me. I set 
myself up." 
</P>
<P>
 He quit in dejection, moved in with his parents for a few years, working on 
his writing. Some polite rejection letters from Hollywood were enough to 
encourage him to move west -- four homeless years ago. And that's all he's 
really accrued since coming to Tinseltown -- stock, courteous, "you've got 
promise" rejections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot harder than I thought," he'll say, "to make contact with people." 
</P>
<P>
 Right. Especially in a city where the tired cliche that "everybody's got a 
screenplay" includes at least one homeless person. 
</P>
<P>
 The future? Castello is 34, and has, for the moment, made the San Fernando 
Valley his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stayed focused," he said. "My parents weren't quitters. I'm not a quitter. 
It's just part of my breeding. I'm not a quitter. I'm just down, but I'm not 
out. I've got relatives here, but I don't beg 'em. I'm a grown man. I got 
myself in, I gotta get myself out. I've read about guys -- financial wizards 
over here -- one guy who went bankrupt four or five times, and came back every 
time. Look at Donald Trump -- they try to take away his (stuff), but he comes 
back. So things like that keep you going." 
</P>
<P>
 The party is over, the bell is ringing  
</P>
<P>
 Fearful of the penalty, taking so much for granted  
</P>
<P>
 Those simple things  
</P>
<P>
 Some relaxing days  
</P>
<P>
 Forgive me, I tell myself  
</P>
<P>
 Time passes so slow, but yet so fast. The bell is ringing  
</P>

TRACKING THE SCENT; A SNIFF CAN TURN YOU HUNGRY OR WARN YOU TO RUN. DR. JAMES 
EVANS IS STUDYING WHY SOME PEOPLE'S SENSE OF SMELL STINKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It only happens now and then, and only for a few precious seconds: the 
quickest whiff of blooming flowers, of coffee brewing, of bacon grilling, of 
freshly cut grass. Then, nothing. No smells at all. Not noxious odors, not 
glorious, evocative scents. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what it's like for Toni La Motta of San Diego. One tantalizing 
perception, then her olfactory mechanism, for some reason, shuts down. It's 
been like that, she says, since high school, more than 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And, until recently, she never found a doctor who seemed to care. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very annoying to me that the medical profession has ignored it," La 
Motta said. "It's like it's really not an issue. Most doctors, when you tell 
them you have no sense of smell, say, 'So what? Live with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But not Dr. James Evans of UC Irvine. Instead, Evans will seal you inside a 
dark, soundproof cubicle, stick electrodes all over your head, wire you up to a 
lab full of computers and diagnostic gizmos, stick a plastic tube into one of 
your nostrils and blow various scents into your nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, an assistant professor of neurology and the director of the Chemical 
Senses Clinic at UCI, is out to help people such as La Motta smell the roses. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1987, Evans has been researching the brain triggers (he calls them 
"olfactory-evoked potentials") that allow us to distinguish smells; about a 
year ago he developed an intricate and highly sensitive system to measure 
olfactory perception. In recent months, he has used the high-tech system to 
measure olfactory and neurological responses in some 70 test patients, from 
head injury victims to allergy sufferers to victims of neurological disease to 
even more mysterious cases such as La Motta's. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his research, Evans hopes to identify more accurately the causes for 
loss of smell (and, by extension in most cases, loss of the sense of taste) and 
develop methods to treat them. It can, he said, be a mysterious process, but he 
has at least one biological advantage. "One of the interesting things about 
olfactory nerves," Evans said, "is that they die and regenerate regularly." 
This means that in some cases of loss of the sense of smell, it may be possible 
to stimulate the growth of olfactory nerves and thereby resurrect that sense. 
</P>
<P>
 I n Evans' lab, he and a group of assistants are refining techniques to 
differentiate between loss of sense of smell because of trauma to the olfactory 
nerves (such as a head injury) and loss because of inhalation of toxic 
substances, or because of allergies or possibly because of neurological 
disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. These diagnostic techniques range from 
measurement of brain activity to the Jelly Belly test. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jelly Belly test is actually an informal demonstration of how the 
olfactory receptors, which are in the upper part of the nose, work. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans offers a visitor two or three Jelly Bellies (a popular, small and highly 
flavorful variety of jelly beans) and asks the visitor to pinch his nose before 
popping the candy in his mouth. The result: a vague sense that something sweet 
is in the mouth but there is no discernible taste. However, once the nostrils 
are released, there is a sudden burst of taste: strawberry, coconut or grape. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, Evans said, one way to gauge what is known as "conductive loss" 
(odors can't reach the olfactory receptors) and "general loss" (in which the 
olfactory nerves have been sheared in an accident). 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Cotton, an 83-year-old test subject from Newport Beach, said she 
suspects that her inability to smell may be tied to conductive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came on slowly," she said, "and I think it may be tied with my sinuses. 
It's been at least 15 years that I haven't been able to smell." 
</P>
<P>
 In the lab tests, she said, she still could smell nothing. However, she said, 
Evans recommended she take zinc supplements for two months, discontinue the 
nose drops she was using and substitute antihistamines to clear her sinuses. 
Zinc, explained Evans, can be depleted by certain types of viruses that can 
also affect smell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can taste sweet and sour and salty on my tongue, no problem," Cotton said 
after starting the zinc treatments. "But if you blindfolded me I wouldn't know 
what I was eating. You learn to appreciate some foods by the sight of them, but 
eating is a pleasure. I would give a lot to have my taste working again." 
</P>
<P>
 Another rather low-tech test in the lab is called "forced choice," in which 
patients are given two small squeeze bottles, one imbued with an odor and the 
other odorless, and asked to identify the one with the odor. The odors are not 
all the same strength, however, because researchers have found that "the 
smelling scale (is) analogous to the decibel scale," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, just as there are degrees of deafness, Evans said, one person may be 
able to smell an odor only in a strong concentration, while another may be 
aware of it in its weakest strength. For instance, a low concentration of amyl 
acetate smells like bananas to a subject with healthy olfactory apparatus, 
while a very strong concentration can smell like airplane glue. 
</P>
<P>
 "At different concentrations they have different qualities," said Evans, "from 
quite noxious and foul to quite pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been found, Evans said, that some people suffer from a condition called 
"specific anosmia," a kind of olfactory color blindness in which the person 
cannot smell certain smells but can perceive most others. To test for this, the 
lab stocks a catalogue of more than 50 aromas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be no genetic receptor in a person for a certain class of odors," 
Evans said. "And it appears to run in families. There are about 150 types of 
odor receptors, which means that we can identify that many classes of smells." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless something goes wrong. Then patients may find themselves attached to the 
most advanced of Evans' testing apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire system measures olfactory evoked potentials (OEP) -- brain activity 
in response to stimulus of olfactory receptors in the nose. Evans said he 
developed the technique of measuring OEP in rats at UCI in 1987 but has been 
using the present system, which he also developed for about a year on various 
human test subjects. At its most basic, the system involves nothing more than 
air and smell. It's the measuring that elevates the process. 
</P>
<P>
 It works like this: The patient is fitted with several scalp electrodes to 
measure brain activity and is plugged into a console inside a dark, soundproof 
booth (the only stimulus Evans wants is through the nose). A small plastic 
nozzle is fitted into one nostril, and a gentle stream of air is directed 
through it into the patient's nose. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the airstream is clean. But at intervals, a machine outside 
the booth emits a click. This means that for 4/100 of a second, what Evans 
calls "a pulse of odor" is introduced into the stream. Computers measure any 
brain wave activity that occurs at that instant. 
</P>
<P>
 This entire process allows Evans and his researchers to locate, among other 
things, the possible source of loss of brain response. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment, Evans said, depends on the cause. In the case of a head injury, the 
nerves may regenerate on their own, or there may be no hope for treatment. 
Sometimes, he said, traditional respiratory therapy can bring back some 
function. Polyps, benign growths, allergies, swelling, infections, sinusitis -- 
all can be treated to different degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, matters become more murky when patients are affected by 
neural degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease 
and Korsakoff's psychosis (seen in alcoholics). 
</P>
<P>
 "Smells will bring back strong memories to you," Evans said, "and all of these 
diseases are associated in some way with memory loss." Partly because of this, 
he said, "olfactory loss may be one of the first things to go" in a patient 
suffering from such diseases. Research is continuing into drug therapy for 
neural disorders, and Evans called the work "promising." However, the tie-in 
remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Depression is common among people with loss of smell, said Evans, although he 
added that "after years, many resign themselves to it and find ways of 
stimulating what receptors they have with salt and spices." Still, there is yet 
another factor to consider: safety. Without a sense of smell, fires and 
natural-gas leaks can go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 La Motta knows this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember an incident in high school," said La Motta, a 48-year-old writer 
and teacher who participated in Evans' research, "when we were doing a hydrogen 
sulfide experiment, and I couldn't smell anything in the lab." Later in life, 
she said, "I'd be in the living room and there would be smoke all over from the 
kitchen. I'd be reading and absorbed and not even notice. One of my major 
problems today is that I burn things frequently in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some times when it's scary, especially if I leave the house and 
don't know something's burning. And the (cat box) is worrisome. My friends have 
to tell me to change the (cat-box filler)."  
</P>
<P>
 During her testing at UCI, La Motta said she "felt" the smell in her nose 
during her time in the booth but didn't actually smell it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fascinating to me, though, because he was actually measuring it. I've 
been through acupuncture, to several doctors. They all said they can cure it, 
and nobody has. I hope this time it's different. 
</P>
<P>
 "People joke with me all the time and say I'm lucky, but I don't see it. I 
can't smell roses or the spring or the ocean." How Sense of Smell Works 
</P>
<P>
 Most people can distinguish thousands of different odors, whether foul or 
fragrant, with a simple sniff of the nose. For people without a sense of smell, 
food doesn't taste as good, flowers and perfume evoke no special memories, and 
potential hazards signaled by noxious odors go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Airborne molecules of a rose travel through nasal passages. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Molecules dissolve in mucous membrane. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Receptor cells are stimulated, then generate nerve impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Nerve impulses travel through olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Olfactory bulb analyzes impulses and sends them to brain, which identifies 
the smell. 
</P>
<P>
 A Perfect Match: 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists believe the smell process occurs when there is a physical 
connection between odor molecules and receptor sites. Bleach molecules, for 
example, would only fit with receptors on some cells, while the odor molecules 
of a rose would only fit on receptors on the other cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast Facts: 
</P>
<P>
 Women, on average, have a better sense of smell than men. 
</P>
<P>
 Older people typically lose their sense of smell. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in ability to smell may be an early sign of Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette smoke and other airborne toxins can lessen or distort sense of 
smell. 
</P>
<P>
 People with depression, schizophrenia or other psychological disorders can 
develop dysosmia, a condition that makes them believe that something 
pleasant-smelling has a bad odor.

 * Orthodontic treatment must begin with a healthy mouth. See a dentist to make 
sure everything is in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
 * Older patients take longer to heal, so they should think long and hard about 
treatments that include major jaw surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 * Patients taking special medications need to let the orthodontist know 
beforehand because certain medications can interfere with movement of the 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 * In cases where patients have had missing teeth for many years, sometimes 
part of the bone structure has lost some width and height, limiting how far the 
teeth can be moved. KATHLEEN O. RYAN

 LOVE IS IN THE AIR: There was a special reason why Eric Bond Scott, 28, and 
Yolanda Valenzuela, 32, were married Saturday while flying in a small plane 
over the Spoons restaurant in Buena Park. That's where they first met and fell 
in love. . . . Scott will be a pilot soon, and during the airborne wedding 
ceremonies, they vowed to use future flying time to take blankets and food to 
the needy. "As soon as we met, it was one of the first things we talked about," 
Scott says. "That's how we knew we had to be together."

 BORIS' LIST: For decades, Rabbi Haim Asa of Fullerton's Temple Beth Tikvah has 
made a personal crusade of gaining recognition for King Boris III of Bulgaria. 
During World War II, the king saved the country's entire Jewish community -- 
including Asa's family -- by defying his Nazi allies. . . . Asa's efforts bear 
fruit this weekend when King Simeon II comes to the Southland to accept an 
award from the Jewish National Fund on behalf of his late father. The deposed 
king, who lives in exile in Spain, comes to Orange County Sunday to visit 
several churches.

 NEW HONDA DEALER: The Orange County Sheriff's Department is poised to accept a 
new addition in its fleet of high-powered crime-fighting vehicles: a 
fuel-stingy 1991 Honda Civic. . . . The car, seized during an October, 1992, 
narcotics investigation, recently became available as Sheriff's Department 
property when prosecutors disposed of the drug case. The compact could see 
action soon -- county supervisors should approve the award today.

USDA ABOLISHES OLD CITRUS QUOTA SYSTEM; AGRICULTURE: CHARGES OF CHEATING BY 
SUNKIST GROWERS AND OTHERS REPORTEDLY LED TO TURMOIL, COSTLY LAWSUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE and DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a repudiation of the giant citrus cooperative Sunkist Growers, the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture said Monday that it will abolish a scandal-ridden, 
Depression-era quota system that let growers keep oranges and lemons off the 
market to prop up prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The USDA said it took the action because accusations of widespread cheating on 
quotas by Sunkist and dozens of citrus growers and packers -- including two in 
Ventura County -- had led to "division and turmoil" within the 
California-Arizona citrus industry and dozens of costly lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's action is unlikely to bring immediate change in citrus prices 
or supplies. The quota system had been suspended since December, 1992, and the 
season just ending operated free of market constraints without radical changes 
in prices or per-acre revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the fact that the orange market didn't collapse "demonstrated that the 
industry could be profitable in a non-quota environment," said Rep. Calvin 
Dooley (D-Fresno), who tried unsuccessfully to forge a consensus among the 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was greeted euphorically by many independent growers and packers 
who had chafed under the cartel-like system, which they said rewarded 
inefficient growers and was controlled by Sunkist. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunkist, based in Sherman Oaks, had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-op, which markets citrus for its 6,500 members who grow two-thirds of 
California's citrus, has long contended that quotas are needed to prevent sharp 
swings in supply and price volatility to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard Rominger, a California farmer who is also deputy secretary of 
USDA, said that he notified Sunkist personally of the decision Monday. While 
"they may not have been happy . . . they were resigned to the fact that this is 
probably the only thing left to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government acted just a week before federal prosecutors were to go to 
trial in Fresno in a decade-old case against Sequoia Orange Co., a packinghouse 
that deliberately violated the quotas in the early 1980s to protest the system. 
</P>
<P>
 That case, which put the Justice Department in the position of prosecuting 
someone for growing too many oranges, was among more than 60 pending lawsuits 
triggered by the system -- including 19 filed by the government last year 
accusing Sunkist and several of its biggest growers and packers of cheating on 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Two large Ventura County packing houses were named in the suits -- Saticoy 
Lemon Assn. and Oxnard Lemon Co. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Monday's action, the government dropped all those suits. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, where lemons and oranges account for combined annual sales 
of more than $200 million, an estimated 70% of the county's citrus growers 
belong to the Sunkist cooperative, according to J. Link Leavens of Leavens 
Ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 Leavens and other local Sunkist growers said both growers and consumers 
benefited from the quotas and the government's action is a setback for both. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly not a plus as far as we're concerned," said Leavens, whose 
family has an 800-acre citrus ranch in Moorpark. "(The quotas) most definitely 
had a stabilizing effect in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Leavens said consumers probably will not notice any change in lemon prices, 
because the quotas for lemons have not been enforced since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he said, the ending of quotas may cause dramatic price fluctuations 
for growers of navel oranges. "It's going to cause some difficulty for the 
navel people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers at the Santa Paula-based Limoneira Co., a Sunkist grower whose 
2,000-acre citrus ranch is one of the largest in the world, likewise expressed 
disappointment in the quota decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is no marketing order, the consistency is just not there," Limoneira 
Executive Vice President Al Guilin said. "Sometimes there's an oversupply, 
sometimes there's an undersupply." 
</P>
<P>
 But James Moody, a Washington lawyer who has been instrumental in fighting 
such quotas, said, "I don't think a progressive Democratic administration could 
tolerate being in the role of keeping food off the table." 
</P>
<P>
 Rominger stressed that the federal agency still favors marketing orders, of 
which production quotas are considered the most onerous part. Such orders also 
let growers act together to promote and market their products. 
</P>
<P>
 "But because of all these violations," Rominger said in an interview, "we 
don't believe (the quotas) have been operating as they're supposed to." 
</P>
<P>
 The USDA said it would consider a new proposal for a citrus marketing order if 
the industry could ever agree on one, and Rominger said Sunkist officials 
indicated they might make such a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Nelsen, president of California Citrus Mutual, a trade group for 850 
growers, said the association is scrambling to get a marketing order in place 
that could operate a statistical and crop forecasting service. Those functions 
were performed under the program being terminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics and supporters generally agreed that Sunkist will survive the USDA's 
action, though its 65% market share might fall. Sunkist's brand name and 
elaborate international marketing system still make it attractive to many 
smaller growers. 
</P>
<P>
 But without the quotas, some larger citrus growers and packers may decide to 
quit the cooperative, which would save them fees paid to Sunkist, and strike 
out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm jumping up and down," said Dennis Johnston, a third-generation citrus 
farmer in Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston said that in the past, he's had to sell as many as 75,000 40-pound 
boxes of navel oranges to juice makers, getting about 50 cents a box, because 
quotas prevented him from selling them as fresh fruit, for which he gets about 
$8 a box. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it'll let me ship the fruit when I decide to ship, and not the boys who 
sit on the (administrative) committee," said Johnston, referring to the 
Sunkist-dominated committee of growers and packers who run the quota system by 
allocating orders to growers. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will end after the expiration of a 60-day notice required by the 
1937 legislation that authorized marketing orders. But many growers have said 
they would stick with Sunkist because of the company's advertising and 
marketing prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest fiscal year ended Oct. 31, Sunkist generated about $1.1 billion 
in revenue, $821 million of which it returned to its members.

 GOP RULES: For 10 years now, Republican voters in Ventura County have 
outnumbered Democrats. . . . But Democrats, who dominated the county before 
1984, have narrowed the gap to a mere 5,332 voters, as of last week's close of 
registration for the June primary. County GOP Chairman Bob Larkin said his 
party has recovered from self-inflicted wounds and will begin to sign up voters 
this summer: "It's time to focus on registration. We will be doing the County 
Fair, and swap meets and street fairs." 
</P>
<P>
 TRASH PATROL: The trail alongside Santa Paula Creek gets more foot traffic 
than any other section of Los Padres National Forest. And some of those 
visitors leave more than footsteps. . . . "It gets pretty trashed," said 
Charlie Robinson of the Ojai ranger station. On Saturday, volunteers will help 
pick up garbage by the creek as part of a nationwide effort by the U. S. Forest 
Service. "Last year," Robinson said, "we cleaned up 35,000 miles of streams and 
river. We are targeting 40,000 miles this year." 
</P>
<P>
 SONG & DANCE: Believe it or not, studies show a drastic decline in kids who've 
got rhythm. And researchers say keeping tempo to music is closely linked to 
children's skills in reading, writing and concentration. . . . So Ventura's 
Mound School teaches second-graders to slap their thighs and kick up their 
heels (B1). Principal Beverly McCaslin said motor-skill classes help children 
organize their thoughts: "It helps kids concentrate and hold their attention 
span longer." 
</P>
<P>
 SHORT ORDER: If you like munching burgers and fries at Hudson's Grill, you'll 
be happy to know that pretty soon the '50s-themed restaurants might be found 
coast to coast. . . . The former Ventura company, now based in Dallas, plans to 
turn its Ventura County restaurants into franchises (Valley Business, Page 9). 
With the bread from franchise sales, the 14-restaurant chain has big plans. 
Said Hudson's Bob Fischer: "Everything is in place to take the theme 
nationwide."

BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT PRESSES OFFENSIVE ON SERB POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Government forces pressed their offensive in northern Bosnia on Monday, 
apparently seeking control of a key Serbian communications post. Bosnian radio 
reported major Serbian losses elsewhere in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio said Muslim-led government troops had seized 12 square miles of 
territory from Bosnian Serbs in several days of "severe fighting" around 
Kladanj, 25 miles northeast of Sarajevo. More than 100 Serbian soldiers died, 
it said. The report could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 If true, it would be one of the biggest land gains during a single government 
offensive against the Serbs, who hold 70% of Bosnia's territory after two years 
of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 In Belgrade, meanwhile, Russia signaled it is standing firm on a new peace 
plan worked out with the United States and several European states, despite 
Bosnian Serb reluctance to give up war gains. The plan would give the Serbs 49% 
of Bosnia, and the new Croat-Muslim federation would get 51%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The percentages of territorial delimitation are non-negotiable, and this goes 
for all three parties in the conflict," Russian envoy Vitaly S. Churkin said in 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 The European Union endorsed the peace plan Monday and said it will draft a new 
map of Bosnia to reflect the proposed division. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bosnian capital, the United Nations reported finding heavy weapons in 
the 12-mile exclusion zone around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Maj. Rob Annink said U.N. military observers found a 60-millimeter 
Serbian mortar and an 82-millimeter Serbian mortar in a neighborhood within the 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials were negotiating with the Serbs to remove the weapons or place 
them under U.N. supervision, he said.

 A proposed plea agreement for a man charged with holding a girl prisoner in a 
dungeon fell apart when a defendant in a related case balked and insisted on a 
trial.John Esposito, 43, is charged with holding Katie Beers captive at his Bay 
Shore home on Long Island. He was willing to accept the plea bargain, said his 
lawyer, Andrew Siben. But Sal Inghilleri, 41, who is married to Katie's 
godmother, refused to plead guilty to two counts of sex abuse involving the 
girl.

 Shannon Faulkner's attempt to force The Citadel to admit her to the corps of 
cadets is trying to force "a unisex world view of the law of the land," the 
state military school's lawyer said. As the trial of her suit opened in 
Charleston, S.C., Faulkner's attorneys said the case is about fairness. She was 
accepted after gender references on her high school transcript were deleted.

VIOLENCE AGAINST MINORITIES ON RISE; BIAS: GAY MEN HAVE SUPPLANTED AFRICAN 
AMERICANS AS THE PRIMARY TARGET OF HATE CRIMES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. 
</P>

 Michael Floyd thought it would never happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon after the 28-year-old gay man moved into a Van Nuys apartment complex 
in 1993, his life became a nightmare. It started when his building manager 
called him "fag" in front of other tenants. Someone scratched a huge "F" into 
his car. He found excrement smeared on his front door. One neighbor shoved him, 
and another threatened to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you doing this?" a shaken Floyd asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer came back loud and clear: Because he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd called the police seven times during 1993 but declined to file charges 
after the assault, mistakenly believing that the torment would stop. After 
other incidents, police told him it was tough to solve anonymous acts of 
vandalism and that they could not act on threats unless accompanied by an 
illegal act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt so helpless," recalled Floyd, who moved to West Hollywood in January 
because he feared for his life. "I thought: 'Do I have to get killed before the 
police will do something?' I'd heard about homophobia and harassment, but I 
never thought it would happen to me. I thought people would treat me as an 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd's case is not unique. Last week, Los Angeles County released its annual 
hate crimes report, which recorded 783 such crimes in 1993, a 6.4% jump over 
the previous year. For the first time since 1980, when the county began 
tracking, gay men supplanted African Americans as the primary target. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate crimes are increasing across the board -- and they are getting more 
violent. Although the stereotypical act of hatred may be a spray-painted 
swastika or scrawled racial epithet, almost one-third of hate crimes in 1993 
were assaults, 105 with deadly weapons, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority will go unprosecuted. According to the county Commission on 
Human Relations, only 12 hate crimes came to trial last year. Trials in two 
more cases, in which people were killed, are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd's case illustrates the difficulty that victims and law enforcement 
agencies face in recognizing and prosecuting such crimes. Los Angeles Police 
Department officials will not comment on how many hate crimes lead to arrests, 
and the district attorney's office cannot break out hate crimes on its 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We struggle with overwhelming odds at every level," said Kay Shafer, the hate 
crimes coordinator for the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Many victims -- including Floyd -- say they did not know there was a law 
against hate crimes. Others are not sure what qualifies as a hate crime. The 
Human Relations Commission says leaning out of a car window and calling someone 
a racially charged name would not qualify. Spray-painting a swastika on a 
synagogue would. Obscene or threatening phone calls that contain racial, 
ethnic, religious, homophobic or sexist slurs are hate crimes. But a fight 
between a white man and a black man would not be logged as a hate crime unless 
racial epithets were exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups monitor the figures closely. A spokesman for the American 
Jewish Committee noted that Jews are victims in disproportionate numbers -- 
they constitute only 5% of the Los Angeles County population but account for 
89.5% of all religious hate crimes. Frank Berry, a spokesman for the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said gays may have a higher 
profile this year but that the number of hate crimes against African Americans 
is still alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Robert Lee Johnson, who is African American. Johnson said he and his 
family were the target of a Latino street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It started with racial taunts. His daughters were assaulted on the way to the 
market. In February, Johnson was shot as he watched TV in his living room. Two 
weeks later, someone threw a pipe bomb into his rented Norwalk home, which 
burned down. The family, which included children and grandchildren, lost 
everything they had. Now living in Compton, Johnson is trying to put the trauma 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, "We deal with it every day. It's always there. It will 
probably always be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is frustrated by the limits of the system. Initially, he said, the 
Sheriff's Department "did a lot of hesitating. When we called, it was like 'No 
one's hurt.' They got offended when my son told them it was a Latino gang. They 
said, 'How did you know it was a Mexican? What was the motive?' Suspicion's 
being turned on me. We haven't committed any crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanon Hodges, a gay African American, recalls the difficulty he had 
persuading police that he was the victim of a hate crime in 1989. Hodges had 
gone to see about renting a Silver Lake apartment and was walking down the 
street about 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Three white skinheads between the ages of 17 and 19 approached, and Hodges, 
who sensed trouble, began to run. One youth yelled, "Nigger faggot, I'm going 
to kill you," Hodges said, and stabbed him in the back with a jagged six-inch 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges staggered down the street and fell into the first open door. It was a 
gay bar, whose manager called police and an ambulance. When police arrived, 
Hodges said, they pulled on his earrings, called him names and told him the 
attack was his fault. Hodges said he spent eight hours at County-USC Medical 
Center waiting to be treated. The assailants were never caught. 
</P>
<P>
 An LAPD spokesman declined to comment on the case, saying that "if conduct 
like that (by the officers) happened, it's inappropriate, and we have a process 
for dealing with that, if (Hodges) wants to file a complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges' scars -- both physical and emotional -- remain five years later. He 
dropped out of art school. He became estranged from friends. He broke off with 
his lover because, he said, he felt ugly. He tried counseling, but it did not 
help. He tried drawing, but the pictures were so angry, he tore them up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As with the attack on Hodges, many hate crimes occur at night. Assailants use 
a hit-and-run approach that leaves few clues. Victims, whether gays in the 
closet, African Americans disaffected with law enforcement or immigrants 
fearing deportation, often do not call the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants' rights groups say their clients can be deported if they report a 
hate crime and an investigation shows that they are here illegally. Some argue 
that California needs to amend its laws so that victims cannot be deported or 
kicked out of the military for reporting hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when victims step forward, community activists say, police do not always 
log the incident as a hate crime -- a charge the police deny. And if arrests 
are made and charges filed, the district attorney must prove that the defendant 
committed the crime and that it was motivated by hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are among the most underreported and underprosecuted crimes around," 
said Brian Levin, a visiting scholar at Stanford Law School, who is legal 
director for the Center for the Study of Ethnic and Racial Violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even county statistics are incomplete because only nine of about 40 law 
enforcement agencies provided data. West Covina logged 12 hate crimes last year 
that were not included in the countywide total of 783. West Covina police crime 
analyst Anne Gray said the county never requested information on hate crimes; 
the county said it contacts each agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Shafer, of the district attorney's office, said that thanks to massive media 
attention and education programs by community groups and law enforcement, 
awareness about hate crime is growing. But she likens it to the status of 
domestic violence and sexual assaults 10 or 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin estimates that half of all hate crimes still go unreported; in the gay 
community, he believes, the figure may be as high as 90%. Only about 1% are 
prosecuted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting the line officer, who is the most cynical and least trained, to 
understand what constitutes a hate crime is very difficult," said Levin, a 
former police officer who now runs hate crime training programs for various 
police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. John White, the LAPD's hate crime coordinator, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people go around bashing the police, but I don't think there's a 
police department in the country that has a system as efficient as us for 
handling hate crimes," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each LAPD division has a hate crimes coordinator, White said. All rookies 
study the issue at the police academy and receive in-service training, 
including periodic memos from White. When a hate crime report is filed, 
follow-up calls are made to the victim's home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to find a nexus, a connection between the crime and the person . . . 
but often there's not enough evidence. If the suspect didn't say anything 
(racist or homophobic), it's hard to classify it as a hate crime," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hate crimes are up, experts say, because Americans seek scapegoats for their 
declining living standards. Hate crimes between minority groups are rising as 
well as crimes against whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get this fear and frustration, people revert back to their in-group 
and want to find a target for their anger," Levin said. "We still harbor 
stereotypes, and they're the trigger that someone who is sick or angry or 
frustrated can beat up on." 
</P>
<P>
 Society also suffers because hate crimes breed fear and distrust among groups, 
dividing people into either victims or perpetrators, Levin said. Hate groups 
recognize the fragility of the inter-group bond and how easy it is to disrupt. 
They know a burglary will not cause a riot but hope that a hate crime might. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most perpetrators are not members of organized groups. About 85% are male, 
in their early or mid-teens, and lead a marginal existence, said Jack Levin, a 
professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University, who co-wrote 
"Hate Crimes, the Rising Tide of Bigotry and Bloodshed." 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years ago they might have stolen hubcaps; now they beat people up," 
Levin said. "They are unremarkable types, the kids down the block. Very few 
wear sheets or armbands or hoods." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy next door was exactly who terrorized John Ruiz and his family in 
Arleta for two years. Paul M. Downing, who mistakenly believed that Ruiz was 
Jewish, spray-painted anti-Semitic graffiti and swastikas on the walls, set 
fires in their home and fired shots into the window. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz, a Catholic of Spanish ancestry, said he had "a great deal of difficulty" 
in getting police interested. Detectives turned up nothing. Ruiz turned to the 
Anti-Defamation League, who persuaded the FBI to pursue it as a civil rights 
violation. Downing pleaded guilty to eight felonies and was sentenced to 10 
years in prison in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the fight left profound scars. After spending $20,000 on fire repairs, 
Ruiz sold his home of 15 years, where he had hoped to retire. He lost his job 
as a national sales manager because he was afraid to leave his family to go on 
business trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Ruiz lives in a security building, in a place he will not reveal. He no 
longer registers to vote because he fears that Downing could obtain his 
address. He and his wife flinch each time a motorcycle passes because the 
hatemonger once harassed them from his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been such a trauma in our lives that we just can't shake it," Ruiz 
said "I am an Everyman. I believe in live and let live. I love my country. And 
it's horrifying to me that this can be happening in America. But you can't let 
something like this consume your sanity because then he won. To a degree he won 
anyway. This will always be with us."

AUSTERE COUNTY BUDGET PANNED, PRAISED; SERVICES: REED SAYS SEVEN CLINIC 
CLOSURES WOULD SAVE $500,000 ANNUALLY WITHOUT HURTING CLIENTS. BUT PLAN DRAWS 
ANGRY RESPONSE. 
</P>

<P>
 Citing a need to streamline the public health care system, Los Angeles 
County's top fiscal officer Monday proposed closing seven clinics, including 
two in the San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation by Chief Administrative Officer Sally R. Reed to shut down 
the seven clinics to help balance next year's budget angered patients, health 
officials and advocates for the poor. They vowed to fight the proposal, which 
must be approved by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinics, located in Burbank, Tujunga, Hawaiian Gardens, Pico Rivera, 
Compton, Venice and Los Angeles, provide low-cost or free medical services to 
patients, who visited them about 9,000 times last year. They are among 45 
health centers county-wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said that closing the clinics would save about $500,000 annually in rent 
and utilities without hurting clients who depend on them for prenatal care, 
family planning and other services.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearby health centers, most of which are within five miles of the targeted 
clinics, would stay open later to accommodate extra patients, staffed by former 
employees of the shuttered centers, Reed said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no loss of services," Reed said. "There will be an impact to 
those who live closest to the clinics, but it will not cause anyone undue 
hardship . . . It's an efficiency thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke of the Board of Supervisors questioned 
the wisdom of closing the clinics to save only a fraction of the health 
department's $4.3-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's shortsighted," Burke said. "These clinics provide prenatal care and 
immunization against diseases, which saves us money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are some other things we can do to raise $500,000." 
</P>
<P>
 The board is set today to decide whether to schedule a public hearing on the 
issue in June. Already hard-hit by the Northridge earthquake, the Valley's 
other public health centers would have trouble absorbing extra patients if the 
Tujunga and Burbank clinics closed, county health officials said. Two of the 
Valley's nine clinics were condemned because of quake damage, including the 
largest health center, which is now operated out of a 5,000-square-foot trailer 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost about 60% of our clinical space," said Gretchen McGinley the 
Valley's top health administrator. "Squeezing extra patients in is going to be 
tricky."  
</P>
<P>
 Nurses at the Burbank Health Center said many of the 800 patients they treat 
every month walk to the clinic and would be unlikely to seek health care except 
in emergencies if the center closed because of their lack of transportation.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only place I go to," said Julieta Alejo 39 of Eagle Rock as she 
cradled her month-old daughter during a postpartum visit to the Burbank clinic. 
"I depend on this health facility. I am jobless. I have nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Osthimer, an attorney for San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal 
Services, said she and other advocates for the poor will testify against Reed's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saying the closures won't reduce services overall isn't meaningful for people 
without bus fare," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Langness, a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California, 
said the closures are just the beginning of the county's attempt to consolidate 
its health care services in the face of state budget cutbacks.  
</P>
<P>
 "These cuts are understandable, but they're still regrettable," Langness said. 
"The hospitals are concerned that the less primary care there is, the more 
unnecessary hospital visits there will be."

SAMUELS DENIES ROLE IN DOUBLE SLAYING; TRIAL: COUNTERING WITNESS TESTIMONY, SHE 
DISPUTES CHARGES OF HIRING A HIT MAN TO KILL HER HUSBAND AND PAYING FOR 
EXECUTIONER'S DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels denied in Van Nuys Superior Court Monday that she hired a 
hit man to kill her husband, then another to kill the executioner. She also 
denied that she had openly searched for hired killers in bars. 
</P>
<P>
 But during her first full day of testifying in her own defense at her double 
murder-solicitation trial, Samuels admitted turning to a friend in a bar and 
complaining about her husband, whom she branded a child molester. "I wish the 
son of a bitch was dead," she recalled saying. Then, she testified, a stranger 
named Dave approached her and said he knew where she could find a killer for 
hire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell off the barstool," Samuels said. Then, she said, she giggled. 
</P>
<P>
 In her testimony, Samuels, 45, disputed the stories of nearly a dozen 
witnesses, some of whom testified under grants of immunity from prosecution for 
their roles in the deaths of Robert Samuels, 40, and James Bernstein, 27, the 
man suspected of arranging his death. 
</P>
<P>
 She also denied she had flirted with detectives during questioning immediately 
after her husband's body was found. The investigators had testified that she 
frequently leaned over in a low-cut blouse, and rubbed one investigator's head, 
saying, "I like bald guys." 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she testified Monday. "I never did it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a constant refrain: She denied hiring Bernstein to kill her husband; 
she denied offering the job to her daughter Nicole's high school friends, and 
she denied asking a man named Angelo to do it after meeting him at a Beverly 
Hills restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Samuels, an assistant motion picture camera operator who worked on 
several films including "Lethal Weapon" and "Heaven Can Wait," was shot to 
death in December, 1988, in the hallway of his Northridge home. Bernstein, a 
reputed cocaine dealer, was beaten and strangled and dumped in a remote canyon 
in Ventura County in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi is alleging that Samuels, who was divorcing her 
husband, had him killed so she could inherit his $500,000 estate, which 
included insurance, the Northridge house and a Sherman Oaks sandwich shop. She 
allegedly orchestrated Bernstein's slaying when she feared he would crack under 
an intensifying police investigation, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Samuels had a crush on Mary Ellen Gurnick while they were growing up in 
Santa Ana, according to testimony. Although their back yards were joined, he 
admired her only from a distance all through elementary school, junior high and 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were too shy to do anything about it," she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 They went their separate ways, then met again in 1980 after her 10-year 
marriage ended. He had never married. They dated for several months, marrying 
in 1980. But a happy ending proved elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 She claims he drank excessively, berated her, struck her and molested her 
teen-age daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Samuels' testimony Monday focused on her descriptions of an abusive 
marriage and on-again, off-again separation. Samuels' defense team contends she 
had nothing to do with either slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, attorneys Phil Nameth and Josh Groshan contend that Bernstein, the 
alleged hit man, acted on his own. The reason: He was smitten with Nicole 
Samuels and angered by her stories of her stepfather's abuse and molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier testimony, Nicole Samuels Moroianu, now 26, said her stepfather had 
molested and raped her since she was 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels has described a harsh six-year marriage in which she had no 
say in decisions, was pressured to work and was treated like a child. She has 
described her husband's late-night drinking bouts and the black eye she says he 
gave her during a liquor-fueled quarrel that followed a Fourth of July party. 
</P>
<P>
 She told of an early morning trip to the bathroom that planted the seeds of 
suspicion in her mind. "I surprised my husband. He was walking out of my 
daughter's bedroom. . . . I surprised him and he surprised me. I asked him what 
he was doing and he said he was letting the cat out." 
</P>
<P>
 Only there was no cat around, she said, and he was walking out of the room. 
Suspicion gnawed at her all day, and she confronted him that night. It led to 
the blowup that eventually resulted in their split. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days before Halloween in 1986, she moved out, leaving a four-page "Dear 
John" note on the dining room table. In the note, she said she wished she'd 
known him better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like being abused, his alcohol problem, which accommodated the 
abuse, and I didn't want to run the store," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter gave no hint that marital abuse or child sexual abuse led to the 
split. Instead, she wrote: "It seems strange that we have been married for just 
about 7 years and I don't know you at all! . . . I feel, (you probably do, too) 
our marriage has gone completely stale and to save my sanity and what's left of 
my health, I want out. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what happens or what you think of me now or later, I will still 
always care for you. We just can't live together!" she said in the note, 
written in pencil on lined paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony continues today.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE FACULTY REBUKES 2 TOP ADMINISTRATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faculty leaders at troubled Pierce College, venting their longstanding 
frustrations on administrators, passed unanimous no-confidence motions Monday 
against former Pierce President Lowell Erickson and Neil Yoneji, the interim 
chancellor of the Los Angeles Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 The college's Academic Senate had been considering the sanction against 
Erickson since last October.But Monday's vote came a month after he ended three 
years as president to take a job in the district's headquarters. Faculty 
members said they never want Erickson to serve as president again at any of the 
district's nine campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty complained that Erickson allowed the college to drift into decline and 
rarely participated in meetings with them. Erickson, in the past, said he did 
the best he could given the district's budget problems, which he blamed for 
poor conditions on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanction against Yoneji, who coordinated the leadership change at Pierce 
from Erickson to current interim president Mary Lee, embodied the complaint 
that he did not consult with faculty members about the change. Yoneji has 
maintained he had to act quickly to install a new president in time to 
influence Pierce's budget for the coming school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanction motions by Pierce's faculty leaders are strictly statements of 
their opinion and have no binding effect, although such motions can be 
considered by the district's Board of Trustees in future personnel decisions. 
Such motions used to be rare, although they have become more common in recent 
years at colleges facing tough economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same meeting Monday, faculty leaders withdrew proposed no-confidence 
motions against the two other top administrators under Erickson who have 
remained at the college with Lee: Don Love, vice president for administration, 
and Bill Norlund, vice president for academic affairs. JOHN CHANDLER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: AT-RISK STUDENTS ESCAPE GRITTY LIFE IN NEIGHBORHOODS FOR 
OCEAN OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They traveled just 10 miles off the shore of San Pedro in an aging 65-foot 
fishing boat to learn about sea life.  
</P>
<P>
 But for many of the 30 teen-agers who stood in the ocean breeze at the bow of 
the boat, far from the gritty neighborhoods of Sun Valley and North Hollywood 
where they live, it was the excursion of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know how to swim," said 18-year-old Alma Sandoval of North 
Hollywood as she clutched the bow rail while the boat rolled over three-foot 
swells. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not nervous, I'm excited." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers, from Amelia Earhart and Robert Lewis continuation high schools 
in North Hollywood and Sun Valley, took part in the three-hour tour Monday as 
part of a monthlong math and science program.  
</P>
<P>
 The program, which aims to interest at-risk students in math and science, was 
launched in September by the Los Angeles Unified School District and the 
California National Guard with funds redirected from military downsizing.  
</P>
<P>
 The Guard allocated about $10 million to the LAUSD for similar programs from 
funds once earmarked for military research and development. 
</P>
<P>
 The program included four weeks of math and science classes at the Delevan 
Center in Eagle Rock and four field trips, all with California National Guard 
instructors.  
</P>
<P>
 The ocean excursion was the final field trip of the program, and for many 
students the first time they had ever been on a boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Unaccustomed to the rolling waves, some students moved immediately from the 
bow to the stern of the boat and sat with their heads in their hands until the 
boat turned back to shore. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the seasick perked up when the boat circled a bell buoy near the 
entrance of the harbor where nearly a dozen California sea lions lay, dozing 
and warming themselves in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivon Kovachev, 17, rushed to the bow of the boat with her camera pressed to 
her face.  
</P>
<P>
 "Can you move?" she asked her classmates. "This one is for my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 She snapped close-ups of the cooperative sea lions, who tilted their heads and 
dove into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things like this keep me coming to school," Ivon said, explaining that she 
dropped out of school while she was pregnant with her year-old daughter. "It's 
much better than staying at school all day." SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; INTERIM ON-CAMPUS LIBRARY HAS OPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at Cal State Northridge now have a place on campus to study after 
Monday's opening of the North Library Annex on the north campus just south of 
Devonshire Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15,000-square-foot facility can hold 200 students and has 40 computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is one of three interim facilities the university plans to open 
in the absence of the heavily damaged 220,000-square-foot Oviatt Library, 
closed since the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The annex was converted from an agricultural exhibition hall to a library in 
eight weeks. Since mid-February, CSUN has been operating hourly shuttle buses 
taking students to UCLA libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours at the interim library are 7:45 a.m. to 11 p.m. Mondays through 
Thursdays, 7:40 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays and 10 a.m. 
to 10 p.m. Sundays. During final exams, which run May 26 to June 2, the library 
will stay open until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Another facility that will hold about 250 students will open within the next 
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on a larger facility holding one-fourth of Oviatt's 1.1 million 
books will begin this summer, and is expected to be completed early in the fall 
semester, CSUN officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oviatt is not expected to reopen for another year or two, officials said.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DONATIONS SOUGHT FOR TURTLES' RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An animal rights group caring for nearly 1,000 turtles that were rescued from 
the back of a van in West Hills is asking the public for donations to help the 
reptiles recuperate from dehydration and other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Channer, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals and the Southern California Humane Society, said Monday that 
all 950 of the animals are under the care of a veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need some help," said Channer, whose agency has been housing the 
terrapins, or freshwater turtles, since they were found in an apartment complex 
parking lot on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got people out buying 20 kids' pools right now, without the slides." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to purchasing water habitats, Channer said the agency needs 
donations to buy turtle food and medication.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency also needs donations of heat lamps, cinder blocks, plywood, and 75- 
to 100-watt light bulbs for temporary land shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Channer said dozens of people have called offering to adopt the 
turtles since they were discovered Friday, the agency will not release them 
until the investigation is complete, which could occur within the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The turtles are evidence," she said. "We really want to file charges on it, 
so we're trying to do this by the book." 
</P>
<P>
 If filed, the charges could include cruelty to animals or illegal 
transportation of live animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Channer said the prime suspect is the owner of the vehicle, identified by 
police as Mark Osterholt, who was found with the van Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the reptiles were awaiting delivery by another vehicle to Santa 
Barbara, where they would have been eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 The turtles, Osterholt said, had been sitting in the van for about eight 
hours.  
</P>
<P>
 The van's odor prompted neighbors to alert police and SPCA investigators, who 
speculated that the reptiles had actually been in the van for days.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of them had already perished. 
</P>
<P>
 To contribute aid to the turtles, call (213) 730-5300. JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SISTER CITY PRESENTS GIFT TO JAPANESE GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Japanese Garden has received a traditional stone lantern as a gift from 
Nagoya, Japan's sister city to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The stone snow-viewing lantern, called a yukimi doro , was presented to the 
Japanese Garden, located at the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in Van Nuys, on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing just under a ton, the lantern has been placed where it can be seen 
from almost everywhere in the 6 1/2-acre garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the key elements," said landscape garden coordinator Gene Greene, 
who is an employee of the city's Bureau of Sanitation.  
</P>
<P>
 The lantern was donated in memory of the garden's designer, Dr. Koichi Kawana, 
who died 2 1/2 years ago. A native of Japan, Kawana came to the United States 
to teach art, architecture and Japanese culture in relation to landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene said that Kawana felt the garden was incomplete, and needed five more 
elements, one of them being an oversize snow-viewing lantern.  
</P>
<P>
 "I consider it a kind of personal triumph on my part," he said, explaining 
that he was a friend and colleague of the late designer. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the members of the advisory committee to the garden had been 
researching the acquisition of a stone lantern when officials of the city of 
Nagoya expressed an interest in donating one in memory of Kawana. 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication ceremony included a demonstration of the tea ceremony, 
traditional Japanese drumming and a performance on the koto , a Japanese 
stringed instrument. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: TOLUCA LAKE; FORD REMEMBERS NIXON AT CHARITY GOLF EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than three weeks after attending the funeral of the man he replaced in 
the Oval Office, former President Gerald R. Ford, looking tanned and hale, 
swatted a golf ball around 18 holes here Monday to raise money for abused and 
neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, who has attended the annual benefit for the Children's Bureau of 
Southern California since its inception in 1982, said he is still saddened by 
the loss of Richard M. Nixon, who died April 22 at age 81.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very emotional time for me," said Ford, who turns 81 in July. "My 
wife and I knew the Nixons since 1949. We've known their daughters since they 
were young. I hated to see such a good friend go." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the former chief executive appeared in good spirits as he 
polished off a barbecue lunch platter and headed for the first tee of the 
Lakeside Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy the opportunity to participate in a worthwhile charity," Ford said 
between handshakes with other golfers. "It's very appealing to me to do this 
and be able to play the game I love at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 golfers -- mostly top business executives from Southern California 
and their guests -- participated in the event that was expected to raise 
$200,000 to provide services for foster care, counseling and other services for 
abused and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford is perhaps best known as a golfer for a series of mishaps in which his 
tee shots went awry and injured onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
 But, after practicing three times last week for the tournament, the former 
President hadn't lost his sense of humor about his dexterity with a club, 
noting that he was scheduled to tee off first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't hit anyone for a long time," Ford said. "They all know it's safer 
in back of me than in front." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's first tee shot went straight but veered right, ricocheting off a tree 
into play. But it endangering no one since there were no spectators along the 
fairway. KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PROGRAM WILL HELP RESIDENTS BUY HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Glendale has set aside $5 million to assist low- and 
moderate-income first-time home buyers, officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials initiated the program -- slated to help individuals and 
families buy 39 homes during the next several years -- because of a growing 
concern about the renter-to-owner ratio in Glendale.  
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of the city's residents live in rental housing, said May Ann 
Plumley, chairwoman of Glendale's Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, operated in conjunction with Coast Federal Bank, requires 
first-time home buyers -- categorized as those who haven't owned a home in 
three years -- to provide a 7% down payment on a home, condominium or townhome. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will use its funds, taken from an account derived from property tax 
revenues on city redevelopment projects, to bring the price of a home down into 
an affordable range and provide interest-free second mortgages, said Beth 
Stochl, senior administrative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if a potential home buyer wanted to purchase a $175,000 townhome, 
the city would bring the purchase price down to $150,000 by providing an 
interest-free $25,000 second mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 The home buyer would be required to make a 7% down payment on the $150,000 
purchase price and make payments on the first mortgage to Coast Federal Bank.  
</P>
<P>
 Payments to the city on the second mortgage would not be required for five 
years under program guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates on the Coast Federal Bank mortgage will be determined according 
to a nationwide index, Stochl said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program requires that the maximum purchase price for a condominium or 
townhome not exceed $200,000; single-family homes must not be listed for over 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, applicants must have income less than $58,000 for a family of 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples can earn no more than $46,350 a year, and individuals are eligible if 
they earn no more than $40,550 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, or to sign up for a seminar explaining requirements for 
the first-time home buyer program, call the city's Housing Department at 
548-3936. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; CONFERENCE TO ADDRESS ISSUES AFFECTING YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Racism, peer pressure, crime and a variety of issues bearing down on 
adolescents will be addressed at a special conference including all Valley 
junior high schools next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that all junior high school students are at risk by nature of their 
age and the need to identify with a group, the need to fit in," said Rhondi 
Mitchell, dean of students at Richard E. Byrd Middle School. The Sun Valley 
school will be host of the Valley Youth Leadership Conference with the San 
Fernando Valley Interfaith Council on May 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, whose theme is "Making It All Come Together," is a follow-up 
to a similar conference last year after which students said such sessions are 
needed more often. Organizers now plan to make the conference an annual event. 
A survey asking Byrd Middle School students about their biggest concerns was 
used as the basis for the conference topics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission and other local human 
relations organizations are also helping to put on the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference deals with four broad areas, including conflict management, 
such as dealing with fights and weapons on campus; prejudice and racism; 
improving communication, and developing self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 Each school has been invited to send four students and a teacher to 
participate in the conference, and Mitchell hopes that it will inspire the 
students to set up peer counseling programs at each school where kids will be 
trained to help others of their age deal with all of these issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that by talking about some of these things we will show them we 
are more alike than different," Mitchell said. But the pressures that students 
face are very strong, she said. They must cope with crime and gangs in their 
community, as well as prejudice in their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the students are first-generation (Americans) and their parents come 
from other cultures and with a different lifestyle," Mitchell said. One of the 
workshops in the conference is titled "My Parents Don't Understand Me." 
</P>
<P>
 "We found the main issue facing students is safety," Mitchell said of the 
survey of Byrd's 1,500 students that showed many are concerned about crime in 
the community. But peer pressure also affects them in a variety of ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drugs, alcohol, even good grades," Mitchell said. "They feel pressure to not 
be good students." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the conference, Mitchell is hoping that the lessons will be learned 
and that when faced with racism, prejudice or in dealing with other problems 
students will "have the nerve to stand up for what is right." ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY SEEKS FREQUENCY FOR EMERGENCY RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank is looking for a low-band AM radio frequency for use as an emergency 
radio station to broadcast information to residents during the next earthquake 
or other disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster coordinator Rich Baenen said city officials realized the radio 
station, to be heard only in Burbank, was necessary because the city had 
problems getting information out to the public in the aftermath of the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually did pretty well in getting information out with the resources we 
had," Baenen said, referring to the bulletins printed by the city in the days 
after the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there were some limitations to that because it's not immediate, and the 
distribution is not as wide as we would want it to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Burbank hired a company to search for a frequency where it can set 
up a station. 
</P>
<P>
 The search is expected to take about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's in place when the next earthquake hits, Baenen said the city hopes to 
be able to broadcast earthquake survival information within the first few hours 
after the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The station would cost about $25,000 to set up, which Baenen said he hoped 
could be mostly reimbursed from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this will make things 180 degrees different, but it will be one 
of the tools," Baenen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between emergencies, the station could be used to broadcast local traffic 
reports. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; LIBRARY WILL INSTALL FIRE-SECURITY SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The central Burbank public library will ask for bids at the end of the month 
to install a fire alarm/security system to protect the facility's collection of 
300,000 books. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire damage became a concern after the Los Angeles Central Library was 
destroyed by fire several years ago, and the issue was further underscored by 
the fires during the Los Angeles riots two years ago, said Sandra Christopher, 
Burbank's acting library director. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the city approved $100,000 for a new alarm and public address 
system at the prompting of the Fire Department, which said the library is 
vulnerable to serious losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The company chosen will install smoke alarms with a security system and 
replace the 30-year-old public address system. 
</P>
<P>
 The current public address system is a problem because it does not reach the 
entire library, Christopher said.  
</P>
<P>
 The speakers are only in public areas of the library and cannot be heard in 
restrooms or storerooms, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no way to reach the entire library (in an emergency), except to send 
someone to run around," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department had recommended either sprinklers or smoke alarms for the 
library, but sprinklers were rejected because of the potential for water damage 
to books, Christopher said. Plus, the city's fire headquarters is less than a 
block away from the library on Glenoaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials do not have a schedule for when the new systems would be 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping it would be by the end of the summer," Christopher said. ED BOND

FUNDING OKD FOR 2 VALLEY LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Monday to amend Mayor Richard 
Riordan's proposed budget to provide money for furniture and staff for two 
libraries scheduled to open in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents a southeast 
section of the Valley, the council voted to spend $2.9 million from a reserve 
fund to provide staff and furniture for the Platt Branch Library in Woodland 
Hills and the Mid-Valley Regional Library in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Platt library is scheduled to open in November and the Mid-Valley library 
is expected to open next May. Construction costs were paid for by a 
$53.4-million voter-approved bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional money was approved during the council's first day of budget 
discussions. The council will continue debating the mayor's proposed budget for 
fiscal 1993-94 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's budget initially offered $1.5 million to pay for books and supplies 
at three new Valley libraries, but added no extra money for staff or furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's request for additional funding did not include money for the 
third new Valley library, the Porter Ranch Branch Library, because it is 
scheduled to open during the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Riordan's proposed budget, the Library Department would have to operate 
the new Valley libraries with the department's existing staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional $2.9 million allows the Library Department to keep 37 positions 
that were to be cut under Riordan's budget and add 42 new positions citywide, 
including 11 1/2 positions for Platt library and 18 positions for Mid-Valley 
library, said Joyce Sloss, a city administrative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will do a lot to help the Library Department," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra funding will also be used to add staff and preschool and adult 
learning programs citywide, according to Yaroslavsky's proposal.

VALLEY INTERVIEW: COMMUNITY TIES KEY TO FIGHTING CRIME, SAYS VALLEY POLICE 
CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pomeroy was interviewed by staff writer Josh Meyer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy has commanded Los Angeles Police Department 
operations in the San Fernando Valley since Nov. 1. He has already become a 
visible figure on the local scene, promoting community-based policing and other 
initiatives at meetings and public forums. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy had previously spent six months as the department's employee relations 
administrator, overseeing contract negotiations with the police union. 
</P>
<P>
 He also headed the LAPD's police intelligence unit, which oversees 
anti-terrorist activities, organized-crime investigations and administrative 
vice activities. For several years before that, the 25-year veteran of the 
department supervised the force's narcotics operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy was interviewed by staff writer Josh Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What do you see as your role as chief of the LAPD's Valley 
operations?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: My mission is to reduce crime and to reduce the fear of crime in the 
Valley, and I intend to do that through supporting our officers and community 
groups we already have in place and through continuing the implementation of 
community-based policing that the Valley already has under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Those efforts started long ago, under then-Chief Ed Davis, a longtime 
Valley booster and resident, and expanded greatly under your immediate 
predecessor, Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker. Is the Valley still at the forefront of 
such efforts?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Community-based policing efforts in the San Fernando Valley are going very 
well. We have over 3,000 block captains, about 360 community police 
representatives and literally tens of thousands of citizens who volunteer their 
time to serve their community in conjunction with the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is community-based policing working?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. Community-based policing, at least in the San Fernando Valley, 
began to be focused about two years ago, about the same time the crime rate 
decreased. I think there is a very real correlation between the two. In the 
Valley there has been a 13% reduction in major crimes in each of the past two 
years. In 1994 compared to 1993, violent crimes in the Valley are down 13%, 
homicides are down 46%, total repressible crimes are down almost 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are some of the most successful aspects?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The neighborhood watch program, with all the thousands of people involved. 
Another example is all the anti-graffiti campaigns we have. Every area has an 
active anti-graffiti paint-out program. And we have a tagger task force run out 
of my office. Citizens tell me that when they look around the Valley now, they 
see a lot less graffiti than they used to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What other programs are working that people can volunteer for?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Operation Sparkle, a community clean-up day. Last Oct. 8 we picked up 220 
tons of trash and painted out thousands of square feet of graffiti and we 
intend to do even more this year. Also, the Jeopardy anti-gang program is 
operating very well throughout the Valley, particularly in Foothill and 
Devonshire area, involving everything from mentoring and tutoring at-risk youth 
to sports teams, including track teams, ice hockey and wrestling teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You seem to solicit a lot of community input. How important is that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I can't do my job unless I know what the community wants, and the only way 
I can know what they want is to be accessible to them. I make a conscientious 
and deliberate effort to be as accessible to the community as possible, and to 
accept as many invitations to attend as many public meetings and events as I 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are you hearing from the community?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That depends on what type of group I'm with. Traffic flow is a concern to 
many people. Graffiti and the presence of gang members are also of concern, and 
there is also some fear about carjackings and drive-by shootings, although I 
have yet to encounter victims of these crimes. I don't mean to minimize those 
fears, but the chances of being a victim of such a crime is a lot less than 
what the notoriety of such crimes leads people to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about gangs and community concerns about them? Are you making any 
headway?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We have lots of things going on. We do have task forces dealing with gangs. 
We have our prevention programs such as DARE, which has a gang component, and 
we have the Jeopardy program, which stresses parental intervention in gang 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope to introduce parenting programs in Van Nuys and West Valley, which 
would give parents the skills to keep their kids out of gangs and out of 
trouble. This is not a program we seek to impose on parents, but something we 
would offer to parents who think they need help.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think parents would go for such a program?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We've found there is an urgent need for such a program and that parents are 
grateful when we offer it to them. It doesn't involve simply attending a 
meeting. It's complicated. It has a curriculum that lasts several weeks, once 
or twice a week for several hours. Most parents who are interested already have 
identified that their kids may be in trouble. This would deal with ways to 
address those problems. Van Nuys Division already is setting up such a program. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Crime is at the top of people's list of concerns, but the actual rate of 
most crimes is declining or remains steady. Is there a dichotomy between 
perception and reality?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Perception versus reality is an issue. At every public meeting I go to, I 
try to draw a balance between the fact that there is crime in the community and 
that we need to bring down the crime rate, but that the perception also is 
greater than the reality and that we need not be as fearful as we are. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone will always stand up and say they were a victim yesterday or that we 
the police are insensitive and we don't care. I don't want that to be the case. 
But statistically, crime has been reduced in the Valley, and the continuing 
trend has been that crime is being reduced. I don't want to be a Pollyanna 
about this, but I also want to avoid the Chicken Little atmosphere that 
sometimes pervades our thought processes when it comes to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of internal changes have you made in the way the department is 
run?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Most of that is contract stuff that has to be negotiated with the police 
union. We have done some things to assist employees after the earthquake. One 
of the things we have been able to do is make their hours more flexible, to 
make it more convenient for them. Many of our employees are still feeling the 
effects of the quake personally. Many had their homes damaged or destroyed. But 
as far as services are concerned, the earthquake is not impeding us whatsoever. 
By and large, it is back to business at our police stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you could speak personally to every member of the community, what would 
you say to them?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The first thing I'd tell them is that we care about them, and it is not 
just Police Chief Willie Williams, myself and the managers, but the line 
officers. We have a tremendous number of line officers that work very, very 
hard for the community, in behalf of the community. We all care about the 
community. I'd tell people to join with us in the neighborhood watch program, 
as our eyes and ears, by making a phone call when there is a crime in progress. 
You work with us and we can reduce crime even further. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After Rodney King, some people lost respect for police. Has that changed?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the community saw the police best during the earthquake, and I 
think they appreciate the efforts made in their behalf. I hope they take the 
time to make that appreciation known to the officers, who showed great heroism. 
We all like a pat on the back now and then, and our officers are no different 
than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is morale?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There were and maybe there are some morale problems with the rank and file. 
But even with a few less officers in the field due to the budgetary processes, 
our officer-initiated activity in the Valley -- arrests, tickets, field 
interviews -- is up 8% this year over last. Our officers are working hard and 
doing a good job. We now have a few new police cars in the field with many more 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The stalled contract talks may be resolved soon, and we will have some new 
police facilities in the Valley in the near future. I know our officers will 
appreciate these improvements and I hope it has a positive impact on morale. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about these newly released crime reports showing local hot spots? How 
will they help you in the future?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Once these reports have been fine-tuned and once we fully develop our 
analytical skills, they will help us deploy our officers. We just started them 
last year, and now we are developing them quarterly, and we will soon be at the 
point where these are standardized enough to be used as tools to fight crime 
and deploy our resources. These reports will help us to pinpoint where crime is 
up and down, and where the impact is.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TROUPE SEEKS TO TEACH AND ENTERTAIN WITH 
TRIBAL LEGENDS; SCHOOLS: THEATER-IN- EDUCATION GROUP ACTS OUT STORIES FROM 
NORTH, CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Earth was created by the Moon when he got tired of having no place to put 
his feet, an accomplishment his family considered much more successful than his 
effort to turn himself into cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so students at Sierra Vista Junior High School were told Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 seventh-grade students packed into the school's auditorium to 
watch two performances of "Indian Legends of the Americas" by the L.A. Troupe, 
a theater-in-education group. Any youth expecting to see dancing men clad in 
feathers got a surprise as a cast of four Native Americans in modern garb acted 
out several legends from tribes in North, Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was funny," said Brett Brunsell, 12, one of numerous students who said the 
45-minute performance was more entertainment than education. "There weren't a 
lot of people running around in circles." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cheryl Mahar, one of two women in the production, said such perceptions 
make the show more successful at all levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how much they do learn from it because they're attentive," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Native American show is the first such production by the 7-year-old 
Burbank theater group, which specializes in performances of classic works such 
as Shakespeare's, said Koni McCurdy, one of two partners in the group. The 
group has performed more than 150 productions this year at schools throughout 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy said she wrote the play at the request of teachers at schools that 
book the group for performances. She said she read about 40 books and studied 
various other materials to develop the script. 
</P>
<P>
 "The body of literature is so large that to hone it down to seven or eight 
legends is one of the hardest things I've ever done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance was simple, and the only props were a box painted with 
branches and posters describing each story. Some humorous lines drew chuckles, 
but some Keystone Kops-type stage maneuvers harvested the biggest laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 honor students gathered after the two performances for a workshop 
with McCurdy in which they brainstormed and acted out their own "legend" -- 
that of a giraffe-lion creature who ate the village chief because the chief 
smelled bad, thereby explaining why people bathe. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy said the tale was about what she expected from the student group, but 
the exercise serves to remind them of the way Native American legends were born 
and the cultural purposes they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are really the libraries of the Native American people," she said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; RESTRICTIONS ON ALCOHOL SALE TO TAKE EFFECT 
IMMEDIATELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Worried that businesses planning to sell or serve alcohol would rush to open 
before new regulations take effect, the Palmdale City Council met Monday to put 
the rules into effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, restricting how and where alcohol can be served and sold, 
received tentative approval from the council last Tuesday. The law was 
scheduled to face a final vote June 10, then take effect 30 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 But after last week's meeting, several business owners contacted the city 
about getting their stores or restaurants approved before that deadline, 
Planning Director Molly Bogh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of such inquiries, the council met in a special session at noon Monday 
and voted 4 to 0 to adopt the alcohol rules as an urgency ordinance, which took 
effect immediately. Mayor Jim Ledford, as part-owner of a local sports bar, 
abstained, citing a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Chavira, a Lancaster resident who serves on the Los Angeles County 
Commission on Alcoholism, was pleased by the council's vote. "It is quite 
important and reveals that the council is dead serious about reducing the 
proliferation and undue concentration of alcohol outlets in Palmdale," he said. 
"It's about time." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavira said more than 120 businesses sell or serve alcohol in the city. The 
new law will not affect outlets already in business. 
</P>
<P>
 The law imposes distance requirements to separate such businesses from areas 
it describes as "sensitive," including schools, churches, parks and residential 
areas. Businesses whose primary purpose is to sell alcohol and other outlets 
that cannot meet the distance rules now must get a conditional use permit from 
the city before they can open. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the new law took effect, some alcohol outlets could open merely by 
purchasing a city business license, local officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also imposes new rules on convenience markets, such as banning the 
sale of alcohol from drive-up windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar laws have been adopted in the county and in neighboring Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The law states that Palmdale needed to regulate businesses selling and serving 
alcohol because such outlets could lead to increased crime -- including drunk 
driving -- and have an adverse impact on nearby facilities such as parks and 
schools.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STRETCH OF MAGIC MOUNTAIN ROAD TO CLOSE FOR 18 
MONTHS AS BRIDGE IS REPLACED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A half-mile stretch of Magic Mountain Parkway will close next week for 18 
months while a bridge over the Santa Clara River's south fork is replaced by a 
wider one, city officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The thoroughfare, which runs southeast from Valencia Boulevard and feeds into 
San Fernando Road, is a segment of California 126 and part of a $23-million 
road-widening by the city, county and state that began in January, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 This second of three phases of construction on the project costs $12 million, 
with Santa Clarita paying $2 million and Caltrans paying the remainder. Los 
Angeles County designed this phase but incurred no construction expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled for 10 a.m. Friday. The road will be 
closed beginning Monday and remain so until December, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The work includes demolishing the two-lane bridge in favor of a four-lane 
span, reconfiguring the intersection of Magic Mountain Parkway at San Fernando 
Road and adding a traffic signal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although closure of the busy road shifts traffic onto other intersections, 
city officials say leaving the road open during construction would delay the 
work through mid-1996 and add more than $100,000 to the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had to keep it open, it would take six months more," said city 
spokeswoman Gail Foy. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who live off that section of Magic Mountain Parkway will be allowed 
to drive to and from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinema Drive, which runs south from Valencia Boulevard east of Magic Mountain 
Parkway, was extended earlier this month to connect with San Fernando Road in 
order to ease some of the traffic problems caused by the closure.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ALIANO TO JOIN HART SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 54-year-old Los Angeles police officer has been named to the governing board 
of Santa Clarita's junior high and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 George Aliano was chosen from eight applicants interviewed this weekend by the 
four other board members to fill the William S. Hart Union High School District 
trustee post that Peter Warren vacated in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole career is one of public service," said Aliano, a 23-year Santa 
Clarita resident. "At least (as a trustee) I can have input into issues that 
can turn kids around so I don't have to deal with them as an officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Aliano is scheduled to be sworn in Wednesday. He says he sees safety, 
curriculum and closed campuses as the important issues facing the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hart district oversees Santa Clarita's three high schools and three junior 
high schools, with one more of each opening this fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Warren, 36, resigned in March, 105 days after he was elected, saying he was 
going to work as a consultant to a Canadian development company. Trustees opted 
to fill the seat by appointment rather than pay for a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Other applicants for the post were teacher Adrienne Asarch; attorney Robert 
Crockett; Bruce Fox, a police officer; Bill Manetta, president of the Santa 
Clarita Water Co.; Ronnie Silver, a newspaper columnist; James Temple, a 
computer lab technician for College of the Canyons, and Art Wilde, an AT&T 
telecommunications manager.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; GROUP APPEALS CONDO PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An environmental group Monday appealed plans to build 752 condominiums east of 
the Antelope Valley Freeway, just outside Santa Clarita, saying that the 
project intrudes on the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the county definitely needs to take a closer look at its approval of 
this project," said Michael Kotch, president of the Santa Clarita Organization 
for Planning the Environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Regional Planning Commission approved the project, proposed 
near the corner of Jakes Way and Lost Canyon Road by G.H. Palmer Associates, 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 SCOPE appealed the commission's decision Monday, saying that a protective land 
berm to be included in the condominium community would narrow the flow of the 
Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Plambeck, SCOPE vice president, said the mound of land will increase the 
river's velocity, causing more erosion downstream and reducing the amount of 
water that can filter into the soil to increase the Santa Clarita Valley's 
ground-water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 SCOPE leaders say the developer also fails to address the number of additional 
students who would attend area schools or how it will affect law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 SCOPE appealed the project's tract map and, according to Plambeck, will appeal 
the entire permit for the project once it is known how much that will cost. The 
fee for the appeal hearing was $260. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, to be heard by the Board of Supervisors next month, involves a 
zone change and an amendment to the county's General Plan.

INSIDER; TUSSLE OVER CHINA TRADE BENEFITS NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL THIS YEAR; * 
BOTH SIDES IN DEBATE OVER LINKING COMMERCE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS PUSH FOR END TO 
STALEMATE. 
</P>

<P>
 The wrangling has gone on for nearly five years and now it is showdown time 
for the American policy on trade with China. 
</P>
<P>
 As in every spring since 1990, business executives are converging on 
Washington to ask the President to preserve China's trade privileges in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights activists, deploring Chinese repression, are calling for limits 
on Beijing's trade benefits. Some Chinese dissidents are likewise seeking 
sanctions against China. Emissaries from Hong Kong are pleading that its 
dependence on trade with China should not be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this is not just another year. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisions over the next few weeks by the Clinton Administration and 
Congress about whether to continue China's most-favored-nation (MFN) status as 
a U.S. trading partner will have more lasting impact than in any previous year. 
Forces on both sides of the debate are now pushing to end the five-year 
stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
 The American business community is appealing to the Administration to once and 
for all "de-link" -- that is, to stop making trade with China conditional upon 
human rights improvements. "The time has come to do what we ought to do, to 
renew (China's trade benefits) permanently," argued Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.). 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups and organized labor, by contrast, want the Administration 
to break with precedent and raise the duties on at least some Chinese goods 
sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think partial revocation (of China's trade benefits) is in the cards," Jeff 
Fiedler of the AFL-CIO's Food and Allied Services Trades said. China says that 
any such action would deal a serious long-term blow to relations with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 These two approaches are not mutually exclusive. In fact, the Administration 
is studying both. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials have hinted that, in an effort to forge a compromise, the 
Administration could impose at least a few sanctions on some Chinese goods over 
the coming year and at the same time remove many or all of the conditions for 
renewal of China's trade privileges in future years. The Administration's 
decision will stand unless Congress overrides it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The debate will be about whether we are going to de-link without taking some 
partial step" on sanctions, said one Administration official recently. "Because 
if the Chinese haven't made the sort of progress (on human rights) we're 
looking for, then we lose credibility, including with the Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes in the China dispute are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of U.S. business groups claims that cutting off China's trade 
benefits would threaten $9 billion in American exports to China and as many as 
171,000 jobs here. Labor leaders counter that such jobs estimates are vastly 
inflated and that China, with $30 billion in exports to the United States last 
year, has much more to lose in a trade cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, the outcome of the trade dispute could well determine whether 
the United States seeks to use its trade leverage to try to ease political 
repression elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch (Asia), said he 
worries that a decision to extend trade privileges to China would weaken U.S. 
human rights policy toward other nations in Asia, such as Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 That viewpoint is shared by many Chinese dissidents. "International pressure 
is very important," said Wang Juntao, one of the architects of China's 1989 
democracy demonstrations, who visited Washington last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, who was just released after serving nearly five years in a Chinese 
prison, reported that "every year, my prison conditions improved when there was 
an MFN debate in this country. And after the MFN decision was made, my prison 
conditions would backslide." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors have combined to bring the controversy on China's trade status 
to a climax this spring: 
</P>
<P>
 * Under the Clinton Administration, for the first time, it is official U.S. 
policy to require China to improve its rights policies if it wants its trade 
benefits renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 * American businesses are more threatened than in past years by restrictions 
on trade because China's economy grew by a startling 13% last year. The Chinese 
government has fueled the competitive anxieties of U.S. businesses by hosting 
large business delegations from Germany and other European countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * To an unprecedented degree, China has defied the United States on human 
rights. Cases in point: its roundups of dissidents and its icy treatment of 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Beijing in March. 
</P>
<P>
 China has enjoyed most-favored trade status since 1980, the year after the 
United States formally granted diplomatic recognition to the Communist regime 
in Beijing. These benefits mean that Chinese goods sold in this country carry 
the same low tariffs enjoyed by most other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of countries, such as North Korea, are denied most-favored 
status. Countries without it must export goods to this country under 
Depression-era tariffs that are prohibitively high. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1980s, China's benefits were extended annually and without 
controversy. Then in 1989 came the bloody crackdown by Chinese troops on young 
demonstrators around Tian An Men Square. The toll was at least 1,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, congressional Democrats sought to demand improvements in China's 
human rights, trade and arms control policies in return for renewal of China's 
trade benefits. President George Bush repeatedly vetoed such legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 presidential election campaign, Clinton accused Bush of 
"coddling dictators" and said that he favored attaching conditions to the trade 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking office, Clinton gave China one more year of most-favored 
privileges. He also adopted an executive order setting conditions China would 
have to meet if it wanted the benefits again in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Beijing regime was asked to make "overall significant 
progress" in releasing political prisoners, in its conduct toward Tibet and in 
its handling of Voice of America broadcasts into China, which have been 
routinely jammed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year, as China's economy boomed and the Chinese leadership 
balked at meeting the American human rights conditions, the U.S. business 
community grew increasingly nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, officials in Clinton's National Economic Council and the Commerce 
and Treasury departments made it plain that they were worried about the impact 
of a cutoff of most-favored status on American companies. Some leading 
congressional Democrats served notice that they wanted the President to change 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I supported the President's executive order last year on MFN, in part because 
I believed it would facilitate a more stable relationship with China while 
preserving broad congressional backing," said Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), 
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hamilton said, "whatever leverage MFN conditionality has provided in 
the past year, its application in this next phase would probably be 
counterproductive. It is time to de-link." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Administration officials face several decisions over the next few 
weeks. They must first decide whether to tell the American people that China 
has made the progress on human rights described by Clinton's 1993 order. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Administration has launched a secret, intensive diplomatic 
campaign to get China to make more concessions on human rights, U.S. officials 
say. While Administration officials refuse to acknowledge it, they have 
reportedly dispatched a special emissary to take charge of these last-minute 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret talks seem to have produced at least one result: Over the weekend, 
China released a prominent dissident who had been jailed as one of the 
principal organizers of the 1989 Tian An Men Square demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Administration finds insufficient progress in China, it will have to 
decide whether to revoke trade benefits, impose partial sanctions or take no 
action at all. Partial sanctions could involve raising duties by a small amount 
on all Chinese goods or raising them substantially on some kinds of goods -- 
for example, anything made by China's state-owned enterprises or by the 
People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton must also decide the terms of renewing China's trade benefits next 
year and in the following years. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Clinton will have to win support in Congress for his policy toward 
China. And that may not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been 25% turnover in the House since the last election," observed 
Hamilton. "The new members of Congress do not accept, as a given, the 
importance of U.S.-China relations. They are quick to see the irritants in the 
relationship." China Imports From U.S. (in millions of U.S. dollars)

NEXT STEP; SARAJEVO TRYING TO REINVENT ITSELF AMID BRIEF PEACE; THERE ARE TRAMS 
TO RIDE BUT NO MONEY FOR FARES AND LITTLE WATER, LIGHT OR HEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Succumbing to the black humor that prevails in this battle-scarred city, 
Sarajevans have been convulsed by belly laughs on hearing a "gesture of unity" 
proposed by the Serb gunmen who encircle them: 
</P>
<P>
 The same nationalist rebels whose heavy artillery pounded this capital into 
rubble for two years have suggested sharing operation with the beleaguered 
cityfolk of a newly rebuilt tram network that serves only those trapped within 
the Serbian cordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Envious of the public conveyance that shuttles passengers along the length of 
government-controlled Sarajevo, rebel authorities want tram drivers from the 
multiethnic center to hand over the cars to Serb drivers at a front-line 
station so that service can be extended to "ethnically cleansed" suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, aired in a recent television broadcast, has been met with 
knee-slapping disbelief and kudos for the segregationists' cheek. But the offer 
and the Sarajevans' refusal to take it seriously illustrate the psychological 
impasse hampering reconstruction of this shattered and divided city. 
</P>
<P>
 Serb rebels insist on building parallel services within the territory they 
have conquered, while the Muslim-led government wants to restore the integrated 
transport and utility networks that existed before the war, as well as central 
authority over the carved-up capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reality of division and the hunger among civilians on both sides for 
some semblance of a normal life may bring about the very duplication of 
services that the Serbs have proposed, at least as a first step. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to now, both a U.N. umbrella organization and foreign governments with 
individual initiatives in Sarajevo are aiming to re-integrate the Serb-occupied 
areas with the rest of the capital, rather than creating separate facilities 
that would serve to reinforce its division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technically, it only makes sense to rebuild over the divisions and not 
incorporate them," said Robert Barnett, the newly arrived British charge 
d'affaires. 
</P>
<P>
 The divisions are deep, however. The Serb rebels control more than 70% of the 
aquifers supplying water to Sarajevo, giving them considerable clout and a 
virtual veto over efforts to rebuild the water network that existed before the 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
 The same applies to Serbian dominance over transportation and public utilities 
such as gas and electricity. The Serb rebel lines cut through Sarajevo's 
elongated chain of neighborhoods flanking the Miljacka River and the utility 
distribution grids that serviced the city. 
</P>
<P>
 During the siege, as nationalist Serbs sought to pressure the multiethnic 
capital into surrender, they cinched off the gas supply, blew up water relay 
stations and sabotaged the flow of electricity where the conduits crossed their 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has repeatedly rejected their offers to restore services if it 
will capitulate to the current division of the city. As a result, residents are 
without a reliable supply of such basics as water, light and heat. 
</P>
<P>
 While Serbs living in the conquered areas of Sarajevo are as much in need of 
services as residents in the besieged center, foreigners involved in rebuilding 
the infrastructure warn that there is more at stake than self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government fears that any restoration done now will solidify the 
confrontation lines and the current zones of occupation," said a Western 
diplomat. based here. "The Serbs would like that, as it would strengthen their 
political claims, but we want to be careful to avoid making the current 
political divisions permanent ones." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the U.N. Security Council appointed American diplomat William L. 
Eagleton as special coordinator for Sarajevo to work out plans for the 
capital's reconstruction with the Bosnian government and "other relevant 
authorities." The latter phrase clearly refers to the rogue Serb leadership in 
nearby Pale, which the Bosnian government refuses to consider an equal partner 
in the effort to rebuild structures torn apart by rebel shells. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the proposal to share the trams, which no one in the government has 
dignified with a response, the secessionist Serbs have shown little interest in 
putting Sarajevo back together as a unified city. 
</P>
<P>
 Local government officials, for their part, remain highly skeptical that 
Sarajevo is peaceful enough or open enough to carry out effective 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Serb heavy weaponry still rumbles at the periphery, the capital is still cut 
off by an armed blockade and there are fears the battle for Sarajevo is far 
from over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have free movement. This is the major limiting factor. We can't even 
bring the materials we need for rebuilding into the city because we are still 
surrounded," said Munever Imamovic, Bosnian minister for reconstruction, 
environment, transport and communications. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Imamovic concedes that there have been remarkable changes in the capital since 
the majority shelling was halted by a NATO ultimatum in February. Residents 
stroll in the open after two years of huddling in cellars or dashing from 
building to building to dodge bullets and shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most visible sign of improvement in the lives of Sarajevo's 
380,000 remaining residents was the restoration of tram service in early March, 
after shelling had been halted long enough for government workers to repair the 
cars and tracks damaged early in the siege. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that, Imamovic insists, is more a subsidized psychological boost than 
an indication that life in Sarajevo is returning to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really just another kind of relief program. We cannot charge people to 
ride because no one has any money. Most of the passengers are not going to 
work, but to visit friends or check prices at the central market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychological moves are important. We had a soccer game a few weeks ago that 
really lifted spirits here. But when the same playing field was used later (as 
a helicopter landing site) to evacuate wounded from Gorazde, it reminded 
everyone that such symbolic improvements can quickly be reversed." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's intense battle over the government-held eastern enclave of 
Gorazde dealt a serious setback to what had been an improving mood in Sarajevo. 
As Serb rebels retaliated for token NATO air strikes and a short-lived show of 
resolve by the U.N. Protection Force by taking peacekeepers hostage and seizing 
back weapons that had been used to attack Sarajevo, many Sarajevans worried 
that shelling of their city could resume. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, has chased away any thoughts of private investment to repair 
Sarajevo's blasted buildings and severed telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is on hold for the moment, although we do hope the setbacks are 
only temporary," said Barnett, who helped to put together an initial 
U.S.-British report that estimated the bill for infrastructure repairs at $125 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleton, who began work in mid-April, concedes that much of his undertaking 
will depend on restoring enough stability to give outside investors confidence 
that their projects can be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Muhamed Zlatar, a former professor who coordinates local labor resources with 
the U.N. reconstruction team, exudes frustration over the latest effort by an 
indecisive world community to launch itself into the task of patching up war 
damage while the conflict rages on. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of reasons why the international community is getting 
involved in this way. Perhaps it is interest in business opportunities, but I 
think a bigger reason is guilt," Zlatar said. "Nothing was done to stop the 
destruction, so there is a desire to help by those who feel something should 
have been done." 
</P>
<P>
 Donations are essential for restoring basic utilities, he said. But the most 
pressing need in the capital is for new housing to replace the 87,000 dwellings 
heavily damaged or destroyed in shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Eagleton's tasks is coordination between the reconstruction planners and 
international lending agencies that ultimately will have to pass judgment on 
the viability and importance of costly projects for which donations cannot be 
expected -- such as private housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to be an optimist, but to be honest, nobody is going to approve 
financing for new construction in a city still technically at war," said 
Zlatar. "Right now, it would be like giving money to a drunk. . . . It would 
only be wasted. We will have to wait for everyone to sober up before the money 
will come here."

THE WEEK AHEAD: BERLIN; A VOTE IN GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Germany will elect its first federal president since the reunification of the 
former East and West Germanys on Monday. Ballots will be cast by 1,324 
delegates, marking the first time since 1969 that Berlin's historic Reichstag 
building has been used for a federal election. 
</P>
<P>
 Four candidates are running, and it is expected that the Christian Democratic 
Union's Roman Herzog, a moderate conservative who currently presides over 
Germany's constitutional court, will win. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog became the Christian Democrats' candidate after the party's original 
candidate, Steffen Heitmann, resigned amid criticism of his views on the role 
of women in society, Germany's World War II past and German nationalism.  
</P>
<P>
 The German presidency is a post with little real power but plenty of potential 
for influence. The current president, Richard von Weizsaecker, has been highly 
visible in the post. He steps down on June 30 at the end of two terms. 
</P>
<P>
 German presidents are elected by a delegation of parliamentarians and private 
citizens selected at the state level.

MARKET FOCUS; VENDING MACHINES JINGLE IN ARGENTINA; THE NATION'S NEW ECONOMIC 
STABILITY MEANS THAT COINS ACTUALLY HAVE VALUE AFTER YEARS OF INFLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since October, Alejandro Martin has sold more than 130 American-made vending 
machines, the kind that swallow coins and give out coffee, soft drinks or 
snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's business is not soaring, but it's getting off the ground -- something 
that would have seemed impossible in Argentina during past decades, when 
inflation of triple and even quadruple digits rapidly reduced the value of 
coins. 
</P>
<P>
 Coin vending machines are a sign of new times. In the past 12 months, 
Argentine inflation totaled only 4.3%, the lowest rate since 1953. Monthly 
inflation rates in the past six months have averaged less than 0.1%. Thanks to 
the government's monetary stabilization program, 50 centavos will buy the same 
candy bar it bought half a year ago, making vending machines practical for the 
first time in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Controlling inflation has been one of the main achievements of President 
Carlos Menem and his economy minister, Domingo Cavallo. And monetary stability 
obviously is good for business: The Argentine economy grew a robust 7% last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said the stability and growth, together with the untapped potential of 
vending machines, make his company's future a promising one, though not without 
problems. He is commercial manager of Vendor Argentina, a joint venture of 
Argentine investors and the Des Moines, Iowa-based Wittern Group of 32 vending 
machine manufacturing, marketing and servicing companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our market is going to be a big market," Martin said. "But it is not going to 
be very easy to expand." 
</P>
<P>
 Vending machines are a new concept for Argentines who have watched coins 
quickly become worthless over the years. When Buenos Aires buses recently began 
operating with automatic coin boxes -- another sign of the times -- one of the 
biggest problems was riders boarding without the right change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are changing maybe 40 or 50 years of tradition," Martin said. "This is a 
very big change, and people need to be educated to get used to using coins." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By betting that such a development is coming, he said, Vendor Argentina is 
putting "100% confidence in the Argentine economic plan and the stability of 
the currency." 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists, however, see danger signs in the economy, including an 
overvalued peso, a growing trade deficit and a slowdown in the flow of capital 
into the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Economy Minister Cavallo unveiled a stabilization plan that 
guarantees convertibility of the Argentine peso at one to a U.S. dollar. But it 
took time to convince the marketplace of the peso's stability. In the first two 
years under the plan, retail prices climbed. 
</P>
<P>
 That has made many Argentine products and services overpriced in dollars and 
has set off a series of related results familiar to volatile economies. As a 
result, for instance, some of the country's exports are less competitive on 
international markets, and imports are cheaper. Argentina's trade deficit rose 
to a record $3.7 billion last year and is expected to keep climbing this year. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the investment and financial funds coming into the country have 
covered the trade deficit, but economists say the capital flow is slowing. 
Recently increased interest rates in the United States make Argentina's stock 
market, bonds and other investment instruments less attractive than they were 
last year, economic analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 To draw funds for development, the Argentine government and private sector now 
must pay higher interest rates themselves. "The financial cost of restructuring 
the economy has gone up," said Osvaldo Cortesi, a partner in the Macroeconomica 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 If the trade deficit continues to climb and capital inflow wanes, pressure may 
mount for a peso devaluation. But a devaluation would bring a serious risk of 
renewed inflation. In the past, Argentine retailers traditionally pegged prices 
to the dollar value of the peso, and if the peso-dollar parity is broken, that 
tradition is likely to return, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem is expected to do everything possible to avoid a devaluation and the 
risk of inflation before presidential elections, to be scheduled for sometime 
early next year. Menem hopes to run for a second term, and a surge of inflation 
could undermine his popularity, which has been based in large part on the 
success of his economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, however, the government will have to do something to increase 
exports, said Walter Stoeppelwerth, senior financial analyst at the Smith New 
Court stock brokerage in Buenos Aires. Stoeppelwerth noted that Argentine 
exports account for less than 5% of the country's total economic production, a 
tiny proportion compared with other rapidly developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials say tax cuts and increased efficiency can make Argentine 
exports more competitive without the need for a devaluation. But Stoeppelwerth 
and other analysts aren't convinced that monetary stability is here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll believe it when I can buy a Coke from a machine with coins," he said. 
Argentine Inflation 
</P>
<P>
 Now that inflation has climbed down from the days of quadruple-digit figures, 
the use of coins is returning. Here's a look at the dramatic change in 
Argentina's inflation over the past decade.

NATIONAL AGENDA; THE TROUBLED REIGN OF BHUTTO II; * IN HER SECOND TERM, 
PAKISTAN'S PRIME MINISTER IS LONG ON RHETORIC AND SHORT ON ACTION, SOME 
COMPLAIN. HER POLITICAL ENEMIES ARE GAINING GROUND. 
</P>

<P>
 Within hours after a humiliating defeat for Benazir Bhutto's government at a 
U.N. hearing, a telephone call came through to Pakistan from Islam's holy city 
of Medina. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Pakistan's opposition leader Nawaz Sharif on the line to his party 
colleagues here, taking time out from his pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia to 
orchestrate their reaction on the home front. They demanded that Prime Minister 
Bhutto resign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics in Pakistan can be very rough," said Sharif's press secretary, 
Mohammed Siddique Farooque. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows that better than Bhutto, whose populist father was hanged in 1979 
by the general who deposed him as Pakistan's leader, and who herself was thrown 
out of office in 1990 for her regime's fecklessness and cronyism. 
</P>
<P>
 This time her enemies wanted her head for failing to rally other countries 
behind a U.N. Human Rights Commission vote in Switzerland to censure India for 
its treatment of Muslims in disputed, New Delhi-ruled Jammu and Kashmir state. 
</P>
<P>
 More than six months into Bhutto's second attempt at running one of the Muslim 
world's most turbulent countries, the disappointing lines of what some 
Pakistani wags are calling "Bhutto II" have become clear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even her fans despair that Bhutto appears to have learned little since her 
first 20-month term in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incessant rhetoric that oozed from the government-controlled media about what 
the government intended to do for the people was a poor substitute for action 
on the ground," argues Syed Talat Hussain, assistant editor of the News, a 
Rawalpindi-based daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the decisions of Bhutto II, such as the appointment of female judges 
and the opening of a police station staffed by women -- bold innovations in 
this traditionally male-dominated Muslim society -- "appeared more as 
staggered, haphazard moves, rather than part of a coherent, long-term policy," 
Hussain says. 
</P>
<P>
 When, at age 35, Benazir Bhutto became the first female prime minister of a 
Muslim nation, she appointed more than 70 Cabinet ministers and advisers. This 
time around, she named only 18, and is serving as her own finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Task forces she has appointed are drawing up policy guidelines in problem 
areas such as agriculture and women's issues, but so far there has been little 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir's rakish, silver-tongued father, captivated 
Pakistanis with his brand of "Islamic socialism." But the 40-year-old daughter, 
embracing the doctrine of economic liberalism, is now shifting Pakistan toward 
privatization and denationalization. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenges are stupendous. "Twelve thousand more people will be born in 
Pakistan this day. Two thousand of them will be dead within a year," British 
journalist Christina Lamb has written in the book "Waiting for Allah," a 
searing chronicle of the country's difficult search for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "More of them will learn to use a gun than to speak the national language. 
Medieval sports of cockfighting and bearbaiting will provide more of their 
entertainment than television, and they will have no theaters or concert halls 
to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a third will have access to clean drinking water, and only 15% will have 
sewerage. A quarter will go to school. Many will become heroin addicts. This is 
a country killing its future." 
</P>
<P>
 Things should have been looking up instead. As a result of October's elections 
that returned Bhutto to office and the powerbrokering that followed, her 
Pakistan People's Party forged a comfortable if sometimes unstable 30-vote 
majority in the 217-seat National Assembly. Sardar Farooq Leghari, a longtime 
ally and former government minister, was elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Benazir is in a better position than any democratically elected leader of 
Pakistan has been in, her father included," one Western diplomat commented. 
</P>
<P>
 But that may not be saying much in a country where the army has ruled for 25 
of the 47 years since independence, and where generals and the military's 
Inter-Services Intelligence Agency still play a shadowy, uncertain role. 
</P>
<P>
 One ominous sign of trouble came in March, when Bhutto failed to get her 
candidate elected to the politically important post of chairman of the Senate. 
Even some allies deserted her to back the opposition's candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, she had to send the army into the streets of Karachi after ethnic 
violence led to at least 26 deaths. The implication was that even in her own 
power base, the state of Sind, Bhutto has been unable to cobble together a 
power-sharing agreement embracing both the rural landholding class she was born 
into and urban-based, Urdu-speaking Muslim immigrants from India. 
</P>
<P>
 Election results left opposition forces in charge of two of the four 
provinces, North-West Frontier and Baluchistan. The Pakistan People's Party 
managed to destabilize and then supplant the government in North-West Frontier, 
allegedly through bribery, but the operation badly besmirched the image of 
Bhutto's party. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes that Sharif might agree to a "loyal opposition" role were dashed almost 
immediately. Given the claustrophobic and painful history of Pakistani politics 
-- Sharif was a political creation of Zia ul-Haq, the general who had Benazir's 
father hanged -- civility was too much to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moment that she shows any flexibility, Nawaz jumps in with his ranting 
rhetoric and accuses her of selling out the country," the Western diplomat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the bitter government-opposition deadlock is that for any 
vote involving changes to the constitution, Bhutto needs Sharif -- who himself 
was prime minister from 1990 to 1993 -- and the votes he can muster. For now, 
the two rivals are unable even to implement their shared desire for abolition 
of the power held by the country's otherwise largely figurehead president to 
dissolve government and Parliament, a power to which both have fallen victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Sharif's tenure as prime minister and Benazir's own initiation into 
power, Bhutto II kicked off with a scramble for the spoils of office. Many 
Pakistanis blame Bhutto's abrupt removal in August, 1990, on the unsavory 
reputation acquired by her husband, Asif Zardari, a polo-playing contractor 
dubbed "Mr. Ten Percent" for the rake-off he was said to take from government 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs are clear that Zardari, who spent 28 months in jail on charges including 
kidnapings, extortion and misappropriation of government funds before being 
acquitted, has lost none of his clout. An Indian journalist who came to 
Islamabad the day after Bhutto was sworn in watched as high officials, 
including the defense and interior ministers, trooped respectfully through her 
office. "They weren't there to see her," the journalist said. "They wanted to 
see the husband." 
</P>
<P>
 Corruption, cronyism and the spectacle of politicians seeking power for its 
own sake disgust many Pakistanis who have lost hope that Bhutto or anyone will 
improve the ordinary citizen's lot. "Nobody at the highest circles has the 
intention of providing services to the people," declared a Pakistani woman who 
works for a U.N. agency. "And I mean that in the present tense." 
</P>
<P>
 In Bhutto II, the prime minister has had not only her enemies to worry about 
but people dear to her as well. Her Iranian-born mother, Nusrat, who last 
December lost a power struggle with Bhutto for control of the Pakistan People's 
Party, and her younger brother, Murtaza, whom Benazir has allowed to be jailed 
for allegedly masterminding both the 1992 hijacking of a fishing boat and the 
1981 pirating of a Pakistani airliner, have been among her most vocal and 
damaging critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends had hoped that the family feud was one trouble that Benazir Bhutto 
could solve swiftly. But at a rally last month marking the 15th anniversary of 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's execution, Nusrat and Murtaza were absent. Murtaza 
rejected a government offer to attend the ceremonies under police escort, and 
Nusrat stayed away because only her estranged daughter, and not her son, was 
there. Changing of the Guard in Pakistan Benazir Bhutto, who became prime 
minister for the second time more than six months ago, caps a long list of 
government leaders in the country's 38 years as a republic.

THE PRESS; HAITI -- THE PROBLEM THAT WON'T GO AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration says it's keeping its options open regarding the 
defiant military leaders of Haiti, whose latest maneuver was to install Emile 
Jonassaint, an elderly high court justice, as provisional president, replacing 
the exiled and popularly elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in a 
1991 coup. 
</P>
<P>
 But cartoonists have not hesitated to fire salvos at Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, 
the army chief who engineered last week's attempt to de-legitimize Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest, was elected in December, 1990, and toppled 
in a bloody coup nine months later. The United Nations and the United States 
have demanded his restoration. Strict U.N. sanctions are set to begin this 
Saturday to force the issue, permitting only food and medicine to be sent into 
the Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, where Aristide lives in exile, the past weekend saw debate on 
televised talk shows on whether the United States should take military action 
against the Haitian regime. In Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, acting 
Prime Minister Robert Malval, who resigned his post six months ago in 
opposition to the military position, Monday blistered Cedras, saying he had 
locked the country "in the darkness of night."

POSTSCRIPT; MILLIONS OF LAND MINES LEAVE A DEADLY LEGACY IN BALKANS; * THE U.N. 
PROTECTION FORCE IS DEDICATED TO REMOVING THE DEVICES PLANTED BY WARRING 
ARMIES. BUT THE PROCESS IS SLOW AND EXPENSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Hands on hips, Lt. Patrick Goue, a diminutive officer of the French army, 
paced behind three soldiers who knelt in the dirt stabbing mounds of crabgrass 
with small sticks, probing for land mines left behind by a retreating army 
nearly three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So painstaking is the work of Goue's 17 men that it takes them two hours to 
clear a 65-foot strip. In one week, in a rain-soaked field on the outskirts of 
the airport here, three mines were unearthed. One newly discovered 
antipersonnel mine -- a hockey-puck-sized disk -- fit in the palm of Goue's 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's small," the Frenchman said. "But it's enough for one foot." 
</P>
<P>
 The work of the French force and others in the U.N. Protection Force in 
clearing mines here emphasizes the lasting crisis that hangs over much of the 
former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the conflict stopped now, this land could be uninhabitable unless 
thousands of hours and millions of dollars were poured into mine removal 
efforts, said Kenneth Anderson, an official with the private Human Rights 
Watch. The U.S. State Department estimates that 3 million mines have been 
planted in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 The warring parties "could kiss and make up tomorrow, and they'd be facing a 
humanitarian disaster," Anderson said. "We think the problem in the former 
Yugoslavia, taken as a whole, is massive." 
</P>
<P>
 Its deadly nature was demonstrated May 1, when two American journalists were 
killed by mines. Brian Brinton, a photographer for Magnolia News, a Seattle 
weekly, and Francis Tomasic, a translator, were killed when their vehicle hit 
at least two mines on the road to Salakovac Dam north of Mostar. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is particularly dangerous in the former Yugoslav federation, 
Anderson says, because the combatants have mined territory indiscriminately -- 
even when they anticipate returning to it later. Although the warring parties 
may be trying to keep track of where they leave their mines, there are 
inevitable, lethal errors in their minefield maps. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that the Balkans will join Cambodia and Afghanistan in grappling 
with a murderous legacy of mines for decades to come. Human rights workers say 
one of every 200 Cambodians has been injured by a mine in three decades of 
conflict there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we've got a situation with back-and-forth fighting in a very 
shortsighted way," Anderson said. "Shooting themselves in the foot is the wrong 
term. They're blowing their feet off down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect has prompted human rights groups to campaign to ban the devices 
outright; some opponents of mine warfare want to see them outlawed like 
chemical and biological weapons. Preliminary talks on a ban will be held in 
Geneva this month, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Committee of the Red Cross estimates that there are 65 
million to 100 million active mines buried in fields, forests and beaches 
worldwide, said Johanne Slakmon, an official of the organization's anti-mine 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that mines are used against civilians as a weapon of terror, 
as a psychological terror," she said. "We have proof that more and more mines 
are not used for military necessity, but against civilians." 
</P>
<P>
 Military uses, meanwhile, are unusually cruel. For instance, antipersonnel 
mines, some no wider than saucers, are meant to injure as much as to kill, 
slowing advancing armies by forcing them to treat their wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Western arms manufacturers have suggested that mines could be built with 
self-destruct mechanisms so they would be eliminated at a set time. But the 
mechanism would make mines more costly, and the key reason armies use them now 
is that they provide a cheap defense. Some mines can be made for less than $20 
each, and Balkan regimes have their own factories to produce them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yugoslav government of Josip Broz Tito stockpiled the weapons to protect 
the country against anticipated onslaughts by either the former Soviet Union or 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridding the land of mines, in contrast, is costly -- about $300 to $1,000 for 
each device, if experts include the expense of training sapper crews and 
safeguarding them against the risks of their jobs. The cost quickly soaks up 
aid from international agencies to rebuild war-torn areas. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. military experts -- such as Danish Maj. Paul Nedergaard -- shudder when 
they consider how long it could take to clear Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia of 
mines. More likely, much of the affected land will simply be sealed. "There 
will be lots of places here where you won't be able to walk in the woods 
anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local authorities are working with international aid organizations such as the 
United Nations Children's Fund to try to educate children not to play with 
mines or other relics left by retreating forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Although military engineers for the U.N. forces here have lent their expertise 
to local units clearing mines from the heavy Croatian-Serbian fighting of 1991, 
the United Nations officially clears mines only in territory used by its own 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 So far in the conflict, mines have killed 12 U.N. troops and injured 128. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.N. sappers, Nedergaard said proudly as he watched the work of Goue 
and his troops, have never had a casualty. That fact, though, does not remove 
caution. "If we had very good maps, we could do it much quicker," the Danish 
officer said. "But we can't rely on them. We have to treat (everything) as an 
unknown area, an unknown minefield."

CULTURE; LISBON MOVES TO EUROPE'S CENTER STAGE FOR ARTS FESTIVAL; * MUSIC, 
ANGOLAN SCULPTURE, ARCHEOLOGY, THEATER AND BOSCH PAINTINGS ARE FEATURED IN THE 
YEARLONG EVENT.

 In a museum on a hill, audacious sculpture of dark wood and crafted bronze 
abides with fertility masks, implements of tribal celebration, ornaments, 
thrones for native kings and crucifixes of an imported religion. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a pioneer show of African art, and it has come a long way from Angola to 
Lisbon. About as far, metaphorically, as Lisbon has come to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Portuguese capital, long isolated both physically and culturally on the 
western rim of the Continent, is European Capital of Culture for 1994, by 
decree of its partners in the European Union who are helping to pay for the 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Constancio, the festival director, calls Lisbon '94 "a landmark 
cultural statement of the Portuguese within the context of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival brings a yearlong bounty of art, music, drama and exhibitions to 
Lisbon. And it brings a welcome focus on Portugal, which has rejoined 
mainstream Europe over the past two decades, after centuries of isolation. 
Pedro Santana Lopez, the government's culture secretary, estimates that 
Portuguese museums will draw a million visitors this year.  
</P>
<P>
 An early fruit of the cultural harvest is the critically acclaimed show of 
Angolan sculpture at the newly reopened National Ethnographic Museum.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is the first time a show has shown different aspects of Angolan culture 
from all six regions of the country," said the museum's Rita Sa Marques. "This 
is our way of drawing attention to Angola and of asking how such killing there 
is possible. Where are the people who made these beautiful things?" 
</P>
<P>
 Angola, convulsed by a seemingly endless civil war, was once a Portuguese 
colony. The museum's own Angola collection, assembled across colonial centuries 
by missionaries and explorers, is the basis for a multimedia show that also 
includes a 9th-Century wooden animal head on loan from Belgium, the oldest 
known wood carving from central Africa.

 The ethnography museum, which had been closed for years, is one of a number of 
Lisbon venues on which the cultural year has breathed new life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseu national theater has been redone as the hall for a World's Great 
Orchestras series that is bringing ensembles from Tokyo, Amsterdam, Stockholm, 
Strasbourg, London and other cities. The Sao Carlos national opera house has 
had its face lifted for performances ranging from "Carmen" to "The Damnation of 
Faust." 
</P>
<P>
 The Belem Cultural Center, built near the city's Moorish-Gothic cathedral for 
Portugal's 1992 debut in the European Union's rotating presidency, is another 
fixture of Lisbon '94. The old Tivoli movie house downtown has been overhauled 
as the venue of a film festival showing 100 notable movies in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Archeology Museum is featuring a visit to subterranean Lisbon, 
the tale of an ancient city that has clung to the banks of the Tagus River from 
Roman times through invasions by Visigoths and Moors to a 1775 killer 
earthquake that drowned a major part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 On stage, Lisbon '94 brings a varied menu: from works by Portuguese 
playwrights to Pirandello; from classical Greek theater -- "The Oresteia" by 
Aeschylus -- to "Angels in America," written by American Tony Kushner. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's premier art exhibition, running Wednesday through Aug. 15 at 
the restored-for-the-festival National Museum of Ancient Art, is an adventure 
in imagination. "The Temptations of Bosch or the Eternal Recurrence" will focus 
on a triptych by 16th-Century Dutch master Hieronymus Bosch entitled "The 
Temptations of St. Anthony." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bosch was a precursor of surrealism, as the painting makes plain. The 
exhibition will look at voyages through imagination of other artists from the 
16th to the 20th Century," said show organizer Paulo Pereira. "Many other 
painters have also dabbled with the strange and the marvelous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The triptych, a Lisbon standby for more than a century, will be shown in 
conjunction with mostly borrowed works of other artists who also demonstrate 
what organizers call "an imaginary heritage that chooses neither time nor era 
to express itself through art." Thus will the likes of engravers Durer, Duvet 
and William Blake, and artists Goya, Moreau, Rosseau and Dali share the stage 
with Bosch. 
</P>
<P>
 In another contribution to the festa , Lisbon's refurbished contemporary arts 
museum reopens next month, renamed the Chiado Museum, for a show of naturalist 
works of the 1940s. Contemporary art will be the focus of a show called "The 
Day After Tomorrow," a line borrowed from Portuguese poet Alvaro de Campos: 
"Today I want to prepare myself to think tomorrow about the day after . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Intended as an antidote to end-of-millennium pessimism, the show, opening 
Sept. 20, will include works by contemporary Portuguese and international 
artists, including American James Turrell, said organizer Isabel Carlos. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which has won strong local response despite organizational 
glitches and vexing ticket distribution problems, has also awakened strong 
private counterpoint to public sponsorship of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisbon's first musical, "Bloody Cocaine," is playing to full houses at the 
lovingly restored downtown Politeama Theater, which showed porn movies not long 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lisbon is the show's protagonist," said impresario Felipe La Feria. "It is 
the story of Lisbon in the '20s as microcosm of the clash of cultures in Europe 
in the years after World War I." 
</P>
<P>
 With music by English-schooled, 22-year-old Portuguese composer Nuno Feist, 
the show opens in Maxim's, a nightclub that is transformed sadly into a 
soulless office of the Propaganda Ministry as post-World War II exuberance 
surrenders to decades of dictatorship in Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as what's on, this year is important because of the chance it has 
offered to revamp the museums and theaters of Lisbon. Now, it's a question of 
building on the new contacts and public to keep momentum," said Ruth 
Rosengarten, an Israeli artist and critic who lives and paints in the new 
Lisbon.

PHOTO ESSAY; FACES OF BOMBAY 
</P>

<P>
 "Every day, it gets worse and worse as physical environment . . . and yet 
better and better as city," is one Indian architect's verdict. "Every day, it 
offers more skills, activities and opportunities on every level." 
</P>
<P>
 And more people. From the shantytowns of pathetic makeshift hovels that start 
within yards of Bombay's international airport to miserable shelters built 
under the hulls of beached fishing boats by the Arabian Sea, Bombay is a slowly 
but inexorably rising tide of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure how many people live in this multiethnic Babel. Most 
official sources say 12.7 million -- more than in New York City and Los Angeles 
combined. Whatever the count, half of the men, women and children in Bombay 
live in appalling slums or on the hard pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 From Tamil Nadu, Gujarat or Goa, they are still coming to India's El Dorado, 
its financial, industrial, commercial, trading and filmmaking center, or its 
criminal underworld, to try to make it or just to panhandle enough to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 In this city of seven hot, boggy, malarial islands acquired by the British for 
next to nothing (and leased for a time by the East India Co. for 10 pounds 
sterling a year), property values now rival those in the priciest Western 
cities. Bombay is proof to Indians that everything and anything is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Bombay Stock Exchange, officials can point from the windows of their 
high-rise offices to a magnificent stone tower constructed for 5 million rupees 
by a Parsee cotton merchant who got fabulously rich off the boom in cotton 
sparked by the American Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, near Jordache Plaza -- an upscale shop with a candy-striped 
awning selling licensed Indian-made clothes with the Jordache label -- entire 
families who have fled a dirt-poor existence in farm villages sleep on the 
sidewalk under the banyan trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The very essence of Bombay is in such contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bombay's abiding obsession is making money, and news vendors hawk a 
bewildering array of tabloids and magazines: Rupee, Money Times, Capital, 
Premium Investments, Financial Wizard and so on. Even a Mr. Patel, the 
proprietor of a modest fruit and cold drink stand, has gotten business cards 
printed to show others he's somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 Bombay residents like to think they inhabit India's most cosmopolitan and 
sophisticated city, but the ethnic strife that shattered India last year did 
not spare them. On the contrary, Hindu-Muslim violence was at its bloodiest in 
the slums here, where more than 600 people died in rioting in January, 1993. 
Two months later, a series of bomb explosions tore through the heart of the 
financial district, killing at least 250 people. Outside the stock exchange, 
they are still patching the craters. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Bombay's young stockbrokers has been reading a book titled "Thriving on 
Chaos." It sounds like a guide to life in this unique and perplexing city, 
where cabbies and starlets alike are proud to have an attitude and where 
barefoot urchins stake out a space on Dalal Street, India's answer to Wall 
Street, to play marbles while ambitious young clerks in white shirts hurry 
past.

MTA TO LAY OFF 117 TO HELP OFFSET DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will begin laying off 117 employees 
later this month to help overcome a projected $300-million budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs are part of a plan announced in March to eliminate 269 positions 
and scale back some projects to trim $100 million from a massive operating and 
capital shortfall forecast for the fiscal year beginning in July. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal memo issued last Friday said 117 employees will lose their jobs, 
most of them union workers in the operations unit, including service attendants 
and clerks. MTA officials began the process of notifying those affected on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-seven administrative employees will be let go, including several from 
the agency's planning and programming unit, which maps out the MTA's transit 
projects throughout Los Angeles County. The rest of the 269 total positions 
eliminated have remained vacant since a hiring freeze was imposed at the 
beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin E. White, chief executive officer of the MTA, said the cuts are 
necessary for the agency to balance its $3.4-billion budget. He added that bus 
and rail service wil not be disrupted and that the agency should still be able 
to do long-term planning despite its smaller work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to have to ask more from our people at this time," he said. 
"However difficult this s, internal efficiencies are a must in terms of 
bridging this shortfall." 
</P>
<P>
 All layoffs should be complete by the end of June, in time for the start of 
the fiscal year. The personnel cuts will involve an initial outlay of cash-non 
unionized employees can receive up to six months' salary as severance pay-but 
the reductions should ultimately help the MTA save $25 million in its operation 
budget and $75 million in capital funds. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second round of job cuts at the MTA since the super-agency was 
created last year through the merger of the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. Last October, 
246 positions, mostly administrative, were slashed from the MTA's 9,100-person 
staff, although no layoffs were required because of a voluntary buyout offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial woes have also pushed the agency to consider raising bus fares and 
cutting back bus service-which accounts for 90% of the operating budget-for the 
first time in five years. Despite complaints from passengers and some 
officeholders that those most dependent on public transportation would be hit 
hardest, officials say that some combination of fare increases and service 
reductions is inevitable.

FBI SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE IS REPORTED SETTLED; CIVIL RIGHTS: TWO FEMALE O.C. 
AGENTS WILL BE PAID $350,000. BUREAU DIRECTOR REPORTEDLY HASTENED RESOLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusually swift resolution of a federal civil rights lawsuit, the FBI 
has agreed to pay nearly $350,000 to two female agents in Orange County who 
alleged that they were fondled and taunted by their supervisor, a lawyer for 
the women said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement agreement, the bureau will pay $192,500 to Agent Heather 
Power-Anderson and $155,000 to her colleague, Boni Carr-Alduenda, in exchange 
for their dropping the lawsuit, said Irvine lawyer Christopher B. Mears. 
</P>
<P>
 As a condition of the settlement, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh will also issue 
a public statement within the next few weeks acknowledging the agreement and 
"reiterating the FBI's commitment to the maintenance of a workplace free from 
all forms of discrimination and retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at FBI headquarters and at the U.S. Justice Department in Washington 
said they would have no comment Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the handling of similar complaints in the past, which took 
months -- even years -- to resolve, the settlement comes a mere two months 
after the women sued the Department of Justice alleging that they were 
repeatedly harassed by Supervising Agent John Carpenter, a 20-year-veteran who 
worked in the agency's Santa Ana office. Carpenter has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times has learned that the FBI initiated proceedings to terminate 
Carpenter six weeks ago, and transferred him to the FBI's Long Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
 Mears attributed the speedy resolution to the FBI director's personal 
involvement in securing a negotiated resolution of the women's complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "While not carrying an admission of fault, the agreement clearly reflects the 
seriousness with which the FBI took these claims," Mears said. "It represents a 
real commitment by the director's office to see to it that the laws regarding 
discrimination have some teeth. He is a man of his word." 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson, 38, and Carr-Alduenda, 40, alleged in their lawsuit that 
Carpenter taunted them at work, grabbing them and making lewd remarks during 
several months of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson, of Mission Viejo, has been a special agent since 1984. 
Carr-Alduenda, a resident of Laguna Niguel, has served since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson was assigned to Carpenter's squad, and said the supervisor 
massaged her shoulders. In one incident, she said he kissed her on the back of 
the neck while she was sitting at her desk. Another time, she alleged, 
Carpenter tore her dress when he forced his hand onto her upper thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr-Alduenda alleged that Carpenter constantly grabbed her and commented 
several times about the size of her breasts. In the lawsuit, she said that when 
she returned from maternity leave in September, 1992, Carpenter said to her: 
"Maternity has been good to you. Your breasts are really big. Are you breast 
feeding? I wish I was your baby." 
</P>
<P>
 The women also alleged that James Donckels, the resident agent-in-charge of 
the Santa Ana office, discouraged them from filing discrimination complaints 
with the federal equal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but advised 
them to put their complaints in writing so he could forward them to the Office 
of Professional Responsibility, an internal FBI unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The women said in their lawsuit that they were further taunted and intimidated 
by other FBI officials after they complained about Carpenter's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 During monthlong settlement negotiations, Mears said FBI officials 
acknowledged disciplining other agents linked to the investigation into the 
harassment charges, but they declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the financial settlement, Power-Anderson will be given 250 hours of 
sick and administrative leave that she took to recover from stress induced by 
the alleged harassment, Mears said. 
</P>
<P>
 The women have also been promised that they will not be assigned to any agency 
or field office to which Carpenter is assigned, and that they will not be 
transferred in retaliation for their lawsuit, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the case had gone to trial, Mears said the women could have received no 
more than $300,000 under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 But both Power-Anderson and Carr-Alduenda were "very glad it's over. They 
didn't want their claims ever to go this far," Mears said. "It would not have 
gone this far if they were dealt with in good faith, but it took the direct 
involvement of the director's office for the bureau to come to grips with their 
claims." 
</P>
<P>
 Mears said Power-Anderson and Carr-Alduenda, both of whom have received 
commendations for their distinguished work, will continue to pursue their 
careers with the FBI even though they suffer "rude remarks and cold shoulder 
treatment from a number of their co-workers who feel they have violated the 
FBI's code of silence." 
</P>
<P>
 "With time, the attitudes will change and soften," Mears said. "I think many 
of their fellow male agents have trouble with women asserting themselves. They 
simply have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st Century as it 
relates to the treatment of women in the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Donckels, the agent in charge of the Santa Ana office, declined comment 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is consistent with Freeh's recently announced guidelines 
governing the conduct of FBI employees and emphasizing higher standards of 
ethical behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 In a directive to all FBI executives, Freeh said the guidelines are among 
policies he has sought to institute since becoming director six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have determined that we have been too tolerant of certain types of 
behavior," he said, adding that he wants to "draw a bright line which should 
serve to put all employees on notice of my expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1993, the FBI settled a class-action lawsuit brought by FBI Agent 
Frank Buttino, who was fired in 1990 after his supervisors received an 
anonymous letter informing them that he is gay. While not admitting wrongdoing, 
the FBI agreed to adopt guidelines barring discrimination against homosexuals, 
and to hire a lesbian applicant who was rejected for a job in 1987, allegedly 
because of her sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County lawsuit was believed to be the first sexual harassment case 
filed by women still working as agents. But former Agent Suzane Doucette filed 
a similar lawsuit against the Justice Department in September, alleging she was 
sexually harassed by the head of the FBI's Arizona office. Doucette said she 
was dismissed last year after filing her complaint, which is still pending.

3 KILLED, 3 HURT IN UNPROVOKED GANG ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN and MILES CORWIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach police and city officials appealed for calm Monday after Cambodian 
gang members without provocation -- and apparently bent on racial retaliation 
-- shot six Latino youths at close range as they left a party, killing three 
and wounding three. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the victims, all males between 15 and 19, were members of 
several Latino dance clubs who drove down from Los Angeles to attend a birthday 
party Sunday evening and were unaware of the deadly back-and-forth exchange 
between Latino and predominantly Cambodian American gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like the old gangster movies with all the bodies lying in the street 
and in the car," said Marina Richard, who lives nearby and came out after the 
shooting stopped. "It was a bloody massacre." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was the latest in a brutal war between the ethnic gangs that has 
peaked and waned during the past five years, bringing fear to those who live in 
the heart of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokesman said the unusually brazen and well-organized attack was in 
retaliation for a drive-by shooting a week earlier that left two gang members 
dead. But the targets of the assault at 12th Street and Lewis Avenue were not 
part of the Latino gang that claims the area as its turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a well-thought-out execution, that's what it was," spokesman Bob 
Anderson said. He said it appeared that the gunmen had each been assigned 
particular victims to shoot. "They had specific targets and they knew exactly 
what they wanted to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and city officials organized several meetings with Cambodian and Latino 
leaders Monday and saturated the area where the shooting occurred with dozens 
of police officers, including detectives, traffic officers and others, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real test is what we do and how we respond," Deputy City Manager Joseph 
Rouzan Jr. said. The shooting has prompted "a kind of coming together and 
pulling together of all our resources in the community to abate this problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Police Chief Jerry Lance said Monday night that he was encouraged after 
a 90-minute meeting at the Cambodian Business Center with about 40 community 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people will go back to their neighborhoods and talk to other people and 
have everyone talk to their kids," Lance said. "We asked for this meeting to, 
number one, seek information on what happened and, two, to get the community 
involved. . . . We're the enforcement arm and . . . we'd rather not deal with 
(racial friction). It's got to be dealt with starting in the home." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most retaliatory shootings are drive-bys done on the run, the assault 
Sunday was carried out face to face in front of numerous witnesses. Also, 
witnesses said that a Cambodian gang member had possibly telegraphed the attack 
when he and a companion drove up to the open-air party, got out, masked his 
face with a bandanna and flashed a handgun at the crowd of about 100 dancers. 
Although the dancers and the man with the gun shouted at each other, no shots 
were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those attending the party, Francisco Vasquez, 14, said that after the 
gunman walked by, the dancers were wary of leaving the party, which was in the 
rear parking lot of one of the numerous run-down, stucco apartment buildings 
that line the crowded streets of the neighborhood adjacent to the Anaheim 
Street corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys didn't know about the war going on between the Mexicans and the 
Cambodians because they were from L.A.," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people in a group, who witnesses said were members of numerous 
quebradita -style dance clubs based in South-Central Los Angeles, left the 
party about 8:30 p.m. and had reached their parked car when the gunmen, armed 
with handguns and possibly assault rifles, approached from the rear. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two and perhaps four or more attackers, clad all in black and 
appearing to be between 15 and 20, began firing calmly from the sidewalk and 
the street as their victims approached, witnesses told police. The gunmen had 
scattered by the time police and paramedics arrived to find two dead youths in 
the front seat of the blue Toyota Corolla, four wounded youths on the ground 
and trails of blood running down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 One victim, who a witness said appeared to be about 13 years old, had been 
shot in the arm and the side and was lying in the street, yelling, "I can't 
breathe! I can't make it!" 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting highlighted the difficulties facing Long Beach city officials. An 
energetic redevelopment program has transformed downtown Long Beach, a few 
miles away, into a vibrant area of shops, restaurants and nightclubs. Another 
effort is under way to revitalize the waterfront area and a $111-million 
expansion of the city's Convention Center is set to reopen in October. 
</P>
<P>
 While the downtown is coming alive, so is the increasingly violent standoff 
between poor Latino and Cambodian youths competing for turf and status as well 
as drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime in Long Beach is on the rise but is lower than in many other 
similar-sized cities. And crime in the redevelopment area of downtown is low 
and security is tight, with police patrolling on bicycle and on foot. But not 
far away, in the area known as the Anaheim Street corridor, gang violence 
between Cambodians and Latinos has been going on for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1979, nearly 50,000 Cambodians have moved into the area, which has long 
been home to Latinos and African Americans. Although Cambodians are still in 
the minority, they have managed to transform the sector by establishing 
businesses and social services agencies. In the process, rivalries have 
developed, especially among youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tension between the Mexicans and the Cambodians has been an ongoing 
thing," said Chula Samyuth, 17, a junior at Polytechnic High School nearby. 
"The Cambodians have been picked on a lot in high school because they are small 
and they don't speak fluent English." 
</P>
<P>
 Molly Keobunta, 15, a Polytechnic sophomore, said the racial and gang tensions 
remain outside the school's doors for the most part. "There's no real problems 
here," she said. "It's just outside the school between the gangsters that 
there's problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, the tit-for-tat had claimed at least two lives before Sunday. 
Vikchai Limpung, 19, and Ath Amnat, 13, were killed by suspected Latino gang 
members a week earlier. Later, two Latino gang members were wounded as a pay 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said police have not identified any suspects in either the shooting 
Sunday or the one a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Police established a hot line and people were being urged to call with any 
information about the shooting or rumors of further retaliations. The number is 
(310) 570-7370. 
</P>
<P>
 Several party-goers said they knew which dancing clubs the victims were 
affiliated with but did not know their names. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebradita is a type of Mexican country dance that looks something like the 
Texas two-step, with fast and furious footwork and deep dips of one's partner, 
close to the dance floor. The dance style has become increasingly popular in 
recent years and clubs compete for popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they had been able to identify only one of the three killed. Two 
bodies had yet to be claimed by relatives, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two who died at the scene were males, ages 15 and 19. A 16-year-old boy 
had been hit twice in the head and several times in the body but was alive at 
the scene. He died at St. Mary Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Wendy Kuran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 13-year-old boy who was shot in the abdomen and the arm was in guarded 
condition after surgery, Kuran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others wounded in the attack were taken to Long Beach Memorial Medical 
Center. Jose Figueroa, 19, was released several hours later and a 13-year-old 
boy who had been wounded in the abdomen and arm was in fair condition but might 
require additional surgery, a hospital spokesman said.

ASSAULT CAUSING MISCARRIAGE CAN BE MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a landmark ruling, the California Supreme Court held Monday that a person 
can be convicted of murder for causing the death of a fetus that could have 
been legally aborted. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-to-1 decision will allow prosecutors to charge a defendant with murder 
for causing a pregnant woman to miscarry, even if her fetus had been only seven 
to eight weeks old and incapable of surviving outside her womb. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the case will not directly affect abortion rights, which are 
protected by constitutional privacy guarantees, activists on both sides of the 
abortion debate watched it closely because it posed the moral issue of when 
life begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's decision gives California arguably the toughest fetal murder law 
in the nation. It means that a robber could be sentenced to death if in the 
course of his crime he injured a pregnant woman and caused her to miscarry, 
even if he was unaware that the woman was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also may charge a defendant with multiple murder -- a death 
penalty offense -- for killing a pregnant woman whose fetus could not have 
survived outside her womb. 
</P>
<P>
 "The third-party killing of a fetus with malice aforethought is murder . . . 
as long as the state can show that the fetus has progressed beyond the 
embryonic stage of seven to eight weeks," Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas wrote for 
the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now most California courts have interpreted state law to provide for 
murder charges only in the killing of a fetus capable of surviving outside the 
mother, generally not earlier than about 25 weeks. Under Roe vs. Wade, the U.S. 
Supreme Court's benchmark ruling on abortion, a woman is free to abort her 
fetus until it becomes viable outside the womb. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-abortion forces hailed the California ruling as confirmation that even a 
young fetus is a person. They said the decision underscored the absurdity of 
allowing a mother to abort a fetus whose killing would constitute murder if 
done by a third party. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a victory of sorts because it is giving the identity of humanity to 
an unborn child," said Anne Kindt, executive director of the Right to Life 
League of Southern California. "This type of ruling says, hey, what is in the 
womb is a human being, a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion rights activists generally are uncomfortable with laws that treat the 
fetus as a victim independent of the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Abby Leibman, executive director of California Woman's Law Center, said the 
California Supreme Court has moved the law in a "very troubling direction" by 
paving the way for regulating the behavior of pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fetus is considered a person, she said, lawmakers may eventually try to 
punish a pregnant woman for behavior that could injure her fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I smoke while pregnant," she asked rhetorically, "am I going to be subject 
to criminal sanctions?" 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Stanley Mosk, in a lengthy and graphic dissent, complained that the 
court has defined as murder the killing of a creature "roughly the size of a 
peanut," with webbed hands and feet and a vestigial tail. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this tiny creature is examined under a magnifying glass," he wrote, "its 
appearance remains less than human. Its bulbous head takes up almost half of 
its body and is bent sharply downward; its eye sockets are widely spaced; its 
pug-like nostrils open forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the majority's decision, Mosk said, an unarmed shoplifter who 
accidentally knocks down a woman who is seven weeks pregnant, causing her to 
miscarry, could face death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosk also said that 15% to 20% of all pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion 
at seven weeks, making it difficult for courts to determine whether an assault 
caused the miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled in a San Diego case in which a 20-year-old man was convicted 
of murder for causing a woman to miscarry during a March, 1991, robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Flores, then 21, had just cashed a $378 welfare check when Robert Davis 
approached her and demanded her money. Clutching her toddler in one arm, Flores 
refused to give up her cash, and Davis fired a bullet into her chest. 
</P>
<P>
 The pregnant woman crumpled to the ground, rolling over and over in a vain 
attempt to grab the money. "Dinero, " a witness heard her whimper. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores survived the shooting but her male fetus, not yet six months old, was 
stillborn. It died of loss of blood to the placenta and asphyxiation caused by 
Flores' loss of blood, low blood pressure and shock. 
</P>
<P>
 During Davis' trial, fetal experts testified that the fetus was 22 to 25 weeks 
old. They disagreed over whether it could have survived outside the womb, but 
none put the chance of survival greater than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Michael Wellington, over the objections of the defense, 
told the jury that a "fetus is viable when it has achieved the capability for 
independent existence; that is, when it is possible for it to survive the 
trauma of birth although with artificial medical aid." 
</P>
<P>
 The standard jury instruction defined a viable fetus as one probably capable 
of living outside the womb, a definition that would have been more favorable to 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury convicted Davis of the murder of the fetus, but indicated that it was 
not convinced that he knew Flores had been pregnant. She weighed 192 pounds 
when she was not pregnant and stood 5 feet, 1 inch tall. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis appealed the murder conviction. The 4th District Court of Appeal went 
beyond viability instructions, ruling that any fetus could be murdered if it 
had progressed beyond the embryonic stage. But the court also held that the 
ruling could not be applied retroactively and reversed Davis' murder 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The California high court agreed that the new ruling cannot be applied 
retroactively to Davis. Justices Marvin Baxter and Ronald George dissented, 
contending that the jury instructions in the case were grounded in two 
appellate decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Court of Appeal ruling, the Los Angeles district attorney charged 
defendants with fetal murder in two cases in which the fetus was not yet 
viable. In one case, the defendant pleaded guilty in a plea bargain and was 
sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. In the other, prosecutors 
dropped the fetal murder charge because they could not prove that the fetus was 
alive at the time its mother was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy San Diego Public Defender Jeffrey Thoma, who represented Davis, said he 
looked forward to telling him "he may have his life back." Davis was sentenced 
to life without parole for the murder, assault and robbery. Without the murder 
conviction, he faces about 11 years, Thoma said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that California is now the only state in the country where someone 
can be sentenced to death for killing a fetus incapable of surviving outside 
the womb. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Pamela Klahn, who represented the state in the case, 
stressed that the ruling would not affect a woman's right to an abortion. She 
also said she did not know whether prosecutors would attempt to retry Davis on 
the murder charges under the previous court rulings on viability. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about a third-party non-consensual killing of a fetus," Klahn said. 
"Roe's principles apply only in the narrow context of the abortion decision."

DANGER DEFENSE IN O.C. SLAYING TRIAL IS UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court, ruling in the case of a shooting on a Dana Point 
Beach, held Monday that defendants can escape murder convictions if they kill 
out of an honest but mistaken conviction that their lives are in imminent 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 5-to-2 decision, the court ruled that Christian Steffens of Laguna Niguel 
believed he was in imminent danger when he fatally shot Robert Elliott of Dana 
Point, a reputed "skinhead," on Sept. 8, 1990, after an argument on the beach. 
Steffens was 16 at the time and Elliott was 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's decision allows murder defendants to be convicted of lesser 
charges if they feared imminent harm from their victims. The doctrine upheld by 
the court, known as the "imperfect defense," is widely employed by defendants, 
particularly by battered wives who kill their abusive spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear of future harm -- no matter how great the fear and no matter how great 
the likelihood of the harm -- will not suffice," wrote Justice Marvin Baxter 
for the majority. "The defendant's fear must be of imminent danger to life or 
great bodily injury." 
</P>
<P>
 Without that defense, judges would be required to instruct juries to convict 
defendants of murder unless the killing occurred in clear self-defense or in 
the heat of passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses testified at Steffens' trial in June, 1991, that he was so 
fearful of Elliott that he had taken to sleeping with a gun next to his bed. 
The fatal shooting ended nearly two years of terror for Steffens, who was 
repeatedly beaten and threatened by Elliott, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile Court Judge Francisco P. Briseno found Steffens guilty of 
second-degree murder in a non-jury trial and sentenced him to 17 years to life. 
Deputy Public Defender Marri Derby, Steffens' trial attorney, appealed the 
verdict and sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The state 4th District Court of Appeal reversed Steffens' murder conviction in 
November, 1992, and reduced it to voluntary manslaughter. The attorney general 
then appealed to the state Supreme Court. The high court upheld the appellate 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, it was not clear how long a sentence Steffens would have to serve 
for voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The imperfect defense was also used by Lyle and Erik Menendez, who are facing 
new trials in Los Angeles for the slaying of their parents. The brothers argued 
that they feared for their lives after years of physical and emotional abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Abramson, attorney for Erik Menendez, said the state Supreme Court's 
decision reinforces her client's right to assert that defense in his retrial. 
She said he and his brother had an "understandable" and imminent fear for their 
lives after they had threatened to make public their father's alleged sexual 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyer praised the court's ruling for making clear that such 
defenses have been used for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to think that this was some sort of designer defense that was 
recently made up," she said. "It clearly was not. . . . (The court) recognized 
that non-criminals kill." 
</P>
<P>
 A state legislator has introduced a bill that would write into law the 
acceptability of the defense. The bill would codify a 1979 California Supreme 
Court decision that an honest, albeit unreasonable, fear of imminent danger 
negates the mental state of malice aforethought necessary for a murder 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had contended that such defenses were barred under a 1981 state 
statute and the 1982 Victims Bill of Rights initiative. Chief Justice Malcolm 
Lucas, joined by Court of Appeal Justice Robert K. Puglia in a dissent, agreed 
with prosecutors that the Legislature abrogated the defense in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "No court, not even a supreme one, may create new defenses or revive abrogated 
ones simply as a matter of policy or preference," Lucas wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Christian Steffens could not be reached for comment.

MEDI-CAL LIENS ON HOMES JOLT SURVIVORS OF PATIENTS; BENEFITS: CHANGES IN LAW 
ALLOW DWELLINGS TO BE TARGETED. STATE SAYS IT IS JUST RECOVERING MEDICAL COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Grace Kleiman was still recovering from the shock of her husband's death in a 
nursing home last November when she got another jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Medi-Cal program, which had paid her husband's nursing home bills, 
unexpectedly slapped a $42,000 lien on her three-bedroom home in Westchester to 
recoup the cost of her deceased husband's care. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was such a shock, I panicked," said Kleiman, 77. 
</P>
<P>
 "This came out of the blue," said her son, Leonard Kleiman Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Without notice, hundreds of elderly Californians like Kleiman recently have 
had liens placed on their houses by Medi-Cal officials seeking to recover 
medical bills run up by their late spouses in nursing homes, hospitals and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes of elderly Medi-Cal patients have long been considered sacrosanct 
assets. So those who have been hit by liens say they were caught by surprise -- 
and were given no warning or information about how to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the liens have frozen pending sales or refinancing of 
properties. In others, survivors say, the lien amount was not itemized or was 
miscalculated. 
</P>
<P>
 A little-known change in state law in July, coupled with amended federal 
legislation in October, has enabled state health officials for the first time 
to systematically use property liens to recover Medi-Cal payments from 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said the changes close a legal loophole that has given 
homeowners favorable treatment by allowing them to shelter a substantial asset. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are saying: 'Here's the state going after poor people for no 
good reason,' " said Deputy Atty. Gen. Beverley Meyers. "But these are not 
necessarily poor people. They have homes. There is one house we know of that is 
worth about $400,000. . . . A person like that isn't indigent." 
</P>
<P>
 A class action lawsuit challenging the new policy has been filed in federal 
District Court in San Francisco. Attorneys are scheduled to ask the judge 
Wednesday for a temporary restraining order against the state. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 407 liens have been recorded statewide. Last week, 260 were 
rescinded because they had been "erroneously filed," according to Gerry 
Rohlfes, chief of the state health department's third-party recovery branch, 
which examines estates left by Medi-Cal recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 The liens, which are being recorded on the homes of deceased Medi-Cal 
beneficiaries over age 65, do not have to be paid immediately and do not force 
residents out of their homes prematurely, state officials said. But they do 
unequivocally stake out the state's claim to payment, which must be made when 
the house is sold, transferred or refinanced by survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was floored," said Conchita Diaz when a $24,000 lien was placed on a modest 
two-bedroom house in San Francisco that she and her siblings inherited this 
year from her parents and were in the middle of refinancing. An itemization of 
the lien amount, Diaz said, included her mother's medical bills dating back to 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The liens range from $500 to $200,000 but average about $19,000, Rohlfes said. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated that the new lien program will enable the state to recoup more 
than $12 million annually, a small portion of the $17-billion Medi-Cal budget. 
About $2.9 billion is spent on nursing home care alone for about 75,000 
impoverished Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for Medi-Cal, nursing home residents must spend or relinquish all 
but $2,000 worth of assets. However, they are allowed to keep their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The home has been somewhat sacrosanct," said Pat McGinnis, executive director 
of the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform in the San Francisco Bay 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
 "In computing your assets to qualify for Medi-Cal, your home is exempt," she 
said. "And if you died in a nursing home, you always knew that at least your 
surviving spouse would have the house." 
</P>
<P>
 The liens, she said, have set off panic and confusion among the elderly and 
their children. She said she has received at least 100 calls. "We've had people 
call from other states like Washington and Oregon saying that their parents 
have gotten liens and are going nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "One old guy came in to see me trembling like a leaf," McGinnis said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said in her 22 years as an advocate for the elderly, "people's No. 1 
concern about nursing homes is not the lousy care that they may get there, but 
they worry about losing their home." 
</P>
<P>
 In a class action lawsuit challenging the liens on behalf of a dozen 
plaintiffs statewide, attorney Amitai Schwartz of San Francisco has accused 
state officials of violating the law by filing liens without prior notice or 
opportunity for a hearing. The lawsuit also contends that the appeals process 
for contesting liens is inadequate and that officials have miscalculated lien 
amounts or erroneously placed liens on certain properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohlfes said he is confident that the lien amounts are accurate because state 
computers keep track of every individual's Medi-Cal billings. He said that when 
a Medi-Cal enrollee dies, the computer prints out all the bills of the deceased 
that were run up since age 65. A lien for the total amount is then placed on 
the home of the surviving spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 A more complicated problem for the state, Rohlfes acknowledged, is figuring 
out the surviving spouse's share of property when there are multiple owners. He 
said there may be some cases where the state has imposed a lien that exceeds 
the surviving spouse's ownership interest in the property. 
</P>
<P>
 But issues such as these, as well as hardship cases, can be thrashed out at a 
hearing after the lien is recorded, he said. Within the last few months, he 
said, the department has adopted regulations that set forth a formal appeals 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohlfes said that in California the liens are a "brand new concept that just 
came into being with the new law," but he said New Hampshire has adopted a 
similar policy and some other states are considering it. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Californians should not be surprised to receive the liens because all 
Medi-Cal enrollees sign a form explaining that the state has an "estate 
recovery program" that may attempt to recoup the cost of their care. He 
acknowledged, however, that the forms have no reference to liens. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers of the attorney general's office noted that it is not realistic to give 
notice of liens before they are recorded because "surviving spouses and their 
savvy estate planners will transfer property to others in title only" to avoid 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the new lien program, following the directive of the state 
Legislature and Congress, will help "plug a legal loophole" that has long given 
favorable treatment to elderly homeowners and their heirs. Unlike renters, she 
noted, homeowners are allowed to shelter and bequeath to their children a 
substantial asset -- their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Senate passed legislation last year that was incorporated into a 
voluminous budget trailer bill signed by the governor last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's office referred inquiries to state health officials. Lynda 
Frost, spokeswoman for the Department of Health Services, said: "He felt we 
should . . . collect money for the Medi-Cal program that the taxpayers have 
spent." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said the plaintiffs he represents are all poor, living at bare 
subsistence level, with no savings and no assets except for their homes -- 
ranging from mobile homes in rural counties to modest tract homes in 
metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Ainsworth, 86, who lives in a Laguna Nigel retirement community, said 
the $11,700 lien placed on his home in January exceeds his equity in the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Ainsworth said he is barely squeaking by each month. His monthly income from 
Social Security and some minor investments totals about $1,139. But he owes 
$606 on his house mortgage and $290 on his retirement community fee, leaving 
$243 each month for food, utility bills, clothing and all other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ainsworth's wife, Virginia, died of cancer in September, after five months in 
a nursing home at a cost of about $11,000 paid by the Medi-Cal program. The 
next month, he said, he got a letter from the state saying he would not have to 
repay this money. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in January, Ainsworth said, he was stunned to learn that a lien had been 
put on his home. Last week, the lien was lifted after state officials concluded 
that they had erroneously targeted people like his wife who died before the 
federal legislation took effect in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience has been a stomach-churning roller-coaster ride for the ailing 
octogenarian, who is recovering from a stroke he suffered about 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Schwartz said: "It just goes to show how they're filing liens first 
and asking questions later. This is putting people through all sorts of 
turmoil. I'm just outraged." 
</P>
<P>
 "This new policy," McGinnis said, "is a terribly sneaky attempt by the state 
to get money in violation of the law from the backs of people who can least 
afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers, the deputy attorney general, said state health officials are moving in 
"more aggressive ways" to recoup Medi-Cal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's people's misconception that once you go on Medi-Cal, you don't have to 
pay any money back," she said. She noted that the new lien policy generously 
allows surviving spouses to live in their houses until their own death and pay 
off their deceased spouses' medical bills many years or months after they were 
incurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no interest being charged on these bills," she said.

MINING GIANT GETS U.S. GOLD BONANZA FOR A MERE $9,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what he called a "historic giveaway," Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt on 
Monday reluctantly gave a Canadian mining giant clear title to harvest one of 
the world's richest veins of gold from U.S.-owned land in return for a payment 
of only $9,000 to the federal Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, ordered by a federal judge, could mean huge profits to American 
Barrick Resources Corp. Interior Department officials estimated the value of 
gold on the land that Barrick got Monday at $8 billion to $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt said the deal underscores the need to reform the 19th-Century law 
governing mining on national lands -- an initiative high on the Clinton 
Administration's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many mining companies are not paying their fair share," he said, standing 
beneath an enlarged check for $10 billion that was written out to Barrick and 
signed by "The American People." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're ripping off the American people fair and square. But it is a rip-off 
and it ought to be changed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt called the Barrick patent "the biggest gold heist since the days of 
Butch Cassidy." And Leon E. Panetta, director of the Office of Management and 
Budget and a past supporter of mining reform, noted that the $9,000 patent fee 
that Barrick will be obliged to pay "is less than they charge players for 
fighting during a game" in the National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's patent approval came after Babbitt failed to win legal support for a 
proposed moratorium on the awarding of mining patents until a complex and 
controversial reform bill can be passed. Legislation is heading toward a 
House-Senate negotiation in coming weeks. But strong opposition from Western 
senators, who support mining interests, promises to turn the issue into a 
political firestorm pitting rural industries against urban environmentalists 
and their allies in the Interior Department, including Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrick's patent claim for about 1,800 acres of federal land in northeastern 
Nevada had to be approved without delay, a federal judge ruled in April. 
Interior officials said more than 500 other patent requests, many of them 
lucrative but none as valuable as Barrick's, have been filed with the Interior 
Department. In the wake of the Barrick decision, officials said those patents 
may legally have to be approved under current mining law. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, firms like Barrick, which is based in Canada but has a U.S. 
subsidiary, may mine valuable hard-rock minerals ranging from gold to uranium 
on American federal lands for a onetime patent fee of between $2.50 and $5 an 
acre. The law provides for no royalties -- charges based on the percentage of 
the value of the minerals that are extracted -- to be paid to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also allows anyone -- from independent prospectors to land speculators 
to mining conglomerates -- to patent land, a practice that makes the holder of 
the patent the owner in perpetuity of land that once belonged to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Mineral Policy Center, a watchdog group lobbying for mining 
reform, the law, largely unchanged since 1872, has spawned a network of roughly 
550,000 abandoned mines on federal lands across the country, many of which are 
leaching cyanide, arsenic, cadmium and lead into nearby streams and lakes. And 
it has fostered a taxpayer-sponsored giveaway that continues to make mining 
companies -- most of them foreign -- rich while leaving taxpayers with a 
cleanup bill of between $33 billion and $77 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt called the 1872 mining law "an artifact of a bygone era" when 
lawmakers believed that subsidies should be offered to companies and 
individuals willing to settle the American West and exploit its natural 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 A House bill would dramatically change the 1872 law, imposing an 8% royalty on 
the value of hard-rock minerals extracted from federal lands and ending the 
practice of patenting. The bill, passed in a historic vote last November, would 
use the collected royalties, projected at between $50 million and $130 million 
annually, to establish a fund to clean up environmental contamination left 
behind by thousands of mining operations. Babbitt has praised the House bill 
and offered firm Administration support for reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 A Senate proposal would impose lower royalties and allow mining firms to 
deduct the cost of mining operations from the value of the minerals they mine 
in calculating royalties to the U.S. government. On Monday, Babbitt said that 
the draft Senate proposal backed by Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) 
"represents some very interesting progress."

 His new blue suit pressed, his lone suitcase perched hopefully nearby, the man 
who called himself Kanda Koso patiently awaited his fate. 
</P>
<P>
 After trying to get through immigration at the sprawling Schiphol Airport with 
a false Zairian passport, the self-described 26-year-old shoemaker promptly 
declared that he wanted political asylum. Now he sat in a corner of the empty 
immigration area as Dutch authorities discussed his fate and tried to determine 
if he really was from Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it here," he said in barely audible French. "I want to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had traveled far and gambled much to reach the threshold of a new, 
glittering world, it seemed unlikely that Koso would taste more of it than the 
airport -- and the sandwich and soda that the airport police brought him a few 
hours into his wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Koso was about to run into a hard new truth that confronts the would-be 
migrants who continue to stream into Western Europe from the former Soviet Bloc 
and developing nations: Rules governing both routine immigration and political 
asylum have tightened drastically. And, increasingly, the stories that once 
were enough to spirit them into a land of affluence and opportunity do not work 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 As Europe's rich social democracies close their doors, one of the primary 
destinations of global migration and one of its oldest political sanctuaries is 
being choked off. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Western Europe's border police forces grow, a murky industry now works 
to spirit foreigners around them. A worrisome subculture has sprouted that by 
definition exists outside the law, forcing illegal immigrants to survive on 
black market income or crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "All (West European) countries are restricting asylum procedures and the right 
of entry," said Petra Catz, who deals with refugee questions at Amnesty 
International's office here. 
</P>
<P>
 The tightening mainly grows out of political pressure from a public frightened 
that the influx of outsiders threatens prosperity as well as social cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
 Recession and high unemployment have only strengthened these feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 More than ever, residents of Europe's rich countries believe the German 
right-wing anti-immigrant slogan, "The Boat Is Full." 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to this mood, the German government last year ended its 
once-cherished policy of open asylum and began turning away -- for the first 
time since the Weimar era -- foreigners claiming to be victims of political 
persecution. Interior Minister Charles Pasqua has created a new police force to 
patrol France's borders and lead a crackdown on illegal immigrants. Sweden has 
tightened its visa requirements and its definition of a political refugee. 
</P>
<P>
 When developments in these countries shifted pressure to smaller nations, such 
as Belgium and the Netherlands, they too acted. 
</P>
<P>
 Social scientists here claim that this regional clampdown carries with it two 
serious dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 First, accelerated measures for dealing with asylum-seekers are effectively 
limiting access to one of the oldest and most important havens from political 
persecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "To put it bluntly, the rights of refugees are being undermined," Swedish 
Parliament member Hans Goeran Franck told the Council of Europe's parliamentary 
assembly last month in Strasbourg, France. "There is an urgent need for 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the crackdown in Europe comes as anti-immigration sentiments 
gather force in North America has only magnified its impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Amnesty International's Catz, "We're worried that people are being sent 
back to persecution." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, social scientists argue, the crackdown carries the seeds of a major 
social problem for Europe itself. They are convinced that new government 
measures will not stop migration but merely force it underground. That 
development, they say, is bound to create a spawning ground for crime, drugs 
and other illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've argued against closing the door, because you just replace one problem 
with another that's even worse," said Dennis Dejong, a specialist on 
immigration policy at the European Commission in Brussels. "What's not 
understood is that this whole issue can undermine the fabric of society." 
</P>
<P>
 Many argue that this is already happening. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are no reliable figures on the number of illegal immigrants in 
Western Europe, there is little dispute that it is rising. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Netherlands, few were even aware of the problem until an El Al jumbo 
jet crashed into an Amsterdam apartment house in October, 1992, and many 
victims on the ground turned out to be illegal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Much as illegal immigrants do in the United States, Western Europe's 
"non-people" find low-paying, black market jobs, often as restaurant kitchen 
help or farm laborers, or they are forced into petty crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many parts of Europe, the agricultural sector can no longer function 
without cheap illegals," Dejong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights advocates argue that the new tightening of legal entry will 
further alter the region's demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 Frits Florin, a senior policy adviser to the Dutch Refugee Council here, talks 
of an invisible line that now runs through Western Europe. It separates a group 
of mainly Mediterranean countries, which have given up trying to regulate 
access and simply slammed the door even on most forms of legal immigration, 
from nations farther north that still struggle to sort legal from illegal 
migrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal, Greece, Spain and Italy are already behind this line, Florin claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Lisbon, the slums are full of illegals from Angola and Mozambique, many of 
them de facto war refugees in need of protection, but they don't ask for asylum 
because they know they won't get it," Florin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal, a country of 10.5 million people, has registered about 2,600 
requests for political asylum since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, requests have dropped from more than 26,000 in 1991 to fewer than 
2,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 What is happening, Florin argues, is that the line is moving north. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from a sullen public and a right-wing extremist backlash, 
Germany's mainstream political parties last July agreed to scrap the right to 
unconditional political asylum granted under the post-World War II 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 In tandem with this move, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government beefed up its 
border police and hastily negotiated arrangements with neighboring Poland and 
the Czech Republic to take back rejected asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants 
who try to enter Germany through those countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually overnight, Germany, the main destination of those seeking asylum in 
Western Europe, removed its welcome mat. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the change have been abrupt and dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of applicants registered by Germany's Interior Ministry during the 
first three months of this year fell by more than 70% from the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some argue that in an election year, Kohl's government is content to ignore 
any rise in illegal entry and to point instead to its success in reducing 
asylum-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, Pasqua has won public applause for tough measures aimed at 
controlling the influx of foreigners, including the formation of a police 
force, the Directorate for the Control of Immigration and the Struggle Against 
Illegal Employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The job of this new police force will include tightening border checks and 
tracking down illegal residents when it begins operating this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The new force is part of a broader crackdown that includes mandatory police 
interviews before any marriage involving a foreigner. This change prompted last 
summer's celebrated case involving Fabienne Bricet, 24, who duly went to the 
police with her Algerian fiance, only to see him expelled six days later 
because his residence permit had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 The case burst into the headlines after he was barred from re-entering the 
country and the French consulates in Algeria refused to marry them because they 
were not both French. It was resolved only when the government intervened to 
allow the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures gathered by the European Council for Refugees and Exiles show that 
across the region, these and similar measures in other countries are having an 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of asylum-seekers in 16 West European countries dropped 
significantly last year from a 1992 high of 672,000 to 544,000. 
</P>
<P>
 These numbers are likely to drop further as other openings are gradually 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the Netherlands, renowned as one of Europe's most tolerant 
societies, became the latest West European nation to tighten its frontiers. The 
moves came in an election year. 
</P>
<P>
 New Dutch regulations to deal with asylum-seekers make it possible to 
telescope a review procedure that once took years down to seven months for 
difficult cases and to just six weeks or even less if authorities are sure that 
the applicant's case is "manifestly unfounded." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, those migrants suspected to be clearly economic rather than political 
refugees are sent immediately to a detention house in Amsterdam, where they 
wait until their case is heard. 
</P>
<P>
 With Justice Ministry officials now stationed at the airport, 
non-asylum-seekers suspected of trying to enter for illegal, longer-term stays 
can be expelled immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "On simple visa requests, we can now turn them around on the same day," said 
Hilbrand Nawijn, director of the Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
"They don't even leave the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 New measures to control the country's land borders with Belgium and Germany -- 
borders where the march to a unified Europe has led to the removal of routine 
immigration and customs checks -- reflect the sense of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, Nawijn has started deploying a series of flying squads a few miles 
behind the frontier to swoop in on suspected illegal immigrants as they are 
picked out by spotters stationed at the border crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Where possible, the plan calls for those suspected of entering illegally to be 
photographed as they cross the frontier. The photos, Dutch authorities say, 
would prove where the would-be immigrants came from and, therefore, show which 
country must take them back. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights advocates are appalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this all means is that if the police see a car full of blacks cross into 
the country, they send out the flying squads," Florin said. "This isn't what 
modern Europe is about. We're going backward." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, those dealing with the problem are convinced that only a 
coordinated effort among all the region's countries can contain the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Dejong, the immigration specialist, talks about harmonizing procedures among 
the 12 European Union states, sharing information and even coordinating foreign 
aid to help stem the flow at its source. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged there is a long way still to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "By definition, it's a slow process," he said. "Civil servants are trained to 
defend their nation's sovereignty." Welcome Mat Revoked 
</P>
<P>
 As West European countries toughen their rules, the number of those seeking 
asylum has dropped.

TOBACCO FIRM LAWYERS TRY TO SMOKE OUT POSSIBLE MOLE; CIGARETTES: OBSCURE 
PARALEGAL IS SUSPECTED OF LEAKING TO THE MEDIA DOCUMENTS EMBARRASSING TO THE 
INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's unlikely that Merrell Williams is enjoying his 15 minutes of fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco giant Brown & Williamson, the maker of Kool and Viceroy cigarettes, 
among others, effectively put out an all-points bulletin for Williams, a 
hitherto unknown paralegal, after he failed over the weekend to appear in 
Louisville, Ky., for a court-ordered deposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject: His connection, if any, to explosive company documents leaked 
over the last few weeks to news media and anti-smoking leaders in Congress -- 
documents that will be the subject of congressional hearings set for today and 
Friday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco company and the law firm for which Williams used to work have sued 
him, alleging theft and fraud in connection with the secret papers. Among them 
is a 30-year-old memo in which a top Brown & Williamson executive stated that 
nicotine is addictive, a conclusion industry officials publicly deny to this 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Other documents they accuse Williams of stealing concern plans to defeat 
smokers' lawsuits by hiding industry health research from plaintiff's lawyers. 
Still others show Brown & Williamson hard at work on a safer cigarette it never 
marketed -- apparently to avoid liability in the sale of conventional smokes. 
</P>
<P>
 While health and anti-smoking groups have a field day with these disclosures 
-- and members of Congress use them to push limits on public smoking -- 
Williams is hiding out, reportedly in Mississippi. Thomas E. Royals, a criminal 
defense attorney in Jackson, Miss., confirmed Monday that Williams has retained 
him, fearing he may face criminal charges over release of the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who could not be reached for comment, apparently has never given an 
interview -- his obscurity freeing observers to speculate whether he is an 
intrepid whistle-blower, as his lawyers claim, or merely a thief, as Brown & 
Williamson alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for both views is found in filings in Jefferson County, Ky., Circuit 
Court that tell Williams' peculiar story. 
</P>
<P>
 A 53-year old Ph.D. in literature, Williams early in 1988 took a job as a 
document analyst for Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs, Kentucky's largest law firm -- and 
counsel to Louisville-based Brown & Williamson. B&W, a subsidiary of British 
tobacco giant BAT Industries and the third-largest U.S. cigarette maker, had 
retained the Wyatt firm to sort and analyze thousands of memos, cables, reports 
and other documents that might figure in cases involving the deaths of smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 By his account, outlined in court pleadings, Williams soon was deeply troubled 
by the contents of the documents, which he believed contradicted many of the 
industry's public pronouncements on smoking and health. A longtime smoker who 
had favored Brown & Williamson's Kool and Richland brands, Williams said he 
quit smoking in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 After being laid off by the Wyatt firm in 1992, Williams says he underwent 
quintuple bypass heart surgery. He blamed the heart condition on his smoking 
habit and stress that he said was the result of unwittingly joining a 
conspiracy of lies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Williams retained Louisville attorney J. Fox DeMoisey to sue Wyatt 
and B&W over damage to his health. He told DeMoisey he was already in 
possession of internal documents that would support his damage claim. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMoisey dropped the bombshell in a letter last July to the Wyatt firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Without naming Williams, DeMoisey said he represented a client with a 
smoking-related health claim who also happened to have worked for Wyatt on the 
documents project. The client had copied and removed documents, DeMoisey wrote, 
because he was "shocked at the fraud and hoax being perpetrated upon the 
government and the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that the documents could be covered by attorney-client privilege, 
DeMoisy said he had advised his client to return them, but wanted Wyatt to keep 
them handy. If the health claim could not be settled, DeMoisey said, "it is my 
intention to file suit and immediately demand production" of the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged that a member of their defense team would take their documents for a 
health claim of his own, Wyatt and B&W struck first. They filed a lawsuit and 
obtained a court order requiring the "Unknown Defendant" -- they later 
substituted Williams' name -- to return all documents, and barring him from 
discussing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Williams returned two boxes of documents, also handing over his 
personal computer and an inch-thick narrative describing the documents. B&W 
believed, or at least hoped, that its materials were safe until 10 days ago, 
when the first report on the documents appeared in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, B&W has been trying to depose Williams, hoping to prove he 
illegally retained and distributed copies of the documents in violation of the 
court order. 
</P>
<P>
 They have portrayed Williams in court papers as anything but principled -- 
claiming that he had signed two agreements vowing never to disclose client 
documents. They also filed affidavits in which former Wyatt co-workers 
described Williams as "devious and dishonest" and as "a conniving opportunist 
with an ulterior motive for everything he does." 
</P>
<P>
 DeMoisey dismisses that character sketch, calling Williams "very bright," with 
an "encyclopedic kind of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams "is very concerned about his kids," DeMoisey said. He "has always 
been concerned he was going to get whacked by the fringe elements of the 
tobacco industry . . . so he's been really torn up by the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 DeMoisey said it is unclear if the documents Williams took are the same as 
those recently disclosed. Tobacco officials "are trying to make it sound like 
these things were kept in a vault," the lawyer said. In fact, he said, they 
were stored in a large warehouse and "obviously the security wasn't much." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the documents have been obtained by the Los Angeles Times. One, 
authored by a B&W scientist in 1965, reported that animal tests had shown 
tobacco smoke to be "weakly carcinogenic." The scientist wrote that finding 
could be considered significant, because the industry -- which publicly denied 
a link between smoking and cancer -- had done the research itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Another memo took stock of the industry's position on the eve of the landmark 
Surgeon General's report of 1964 that tied smoking to lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dated July 17, 1963, the long memo by B&W general counsel Addison Yeaman 
stated that nicotine, while beneficial, was addictive -- something industry 
executives denied as recently as last month, when they appeared before the 
House health and environment subcommittee chaired by U.S. Rep. Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 "We are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug 
effective in the release of stress mechanisms," the memo said 
</P>
<P>
 Yeaman also advised -- unsuccessfully, it turned out -- that the industry 
relax its defensive posture about the safety of smoking. By acknowledging a 
possible cancer link, Yeaman wrote, the industry "might worsen our situation in 
litigation," but would be freer to work with health groups in discovering and 
removing the cancer-causing elements of cigarette smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 B&W on Monday released studies commissioned by its sister firm, 
British-American Tobacco Co., that it said showed nicotine is not addictive and 
corrected "erroneous reports about nicotine research attributed to the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 The firm also said it had obtained a court order Monday in Louisville 
requiring Waxman and various news organizations to allow B&W to review 
documents in their possession. Officials with the subcommittee -- and with the 
New York Times and Washington Post, two of the news organizations named in the 
order -- could not immediately be reached for comment.

CLINTON FORMALLY INTRODUCES BREYER AS A REFORMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton formally introduced his compromise choice for the Supreme 
Court to the nation Monday, saying that scholarly appeals court Judge Stephen 
G. Breyer brings to the bench the "heart and head of a reformer." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Rose Garden ceremony, Clinton called Breyer a proven "consensus builder" 
and predicted that he would join the emerging centrist majority on the court. 
The President made it clear that he had not sought a liberal ideologue who 
would sit in lonely opposition but a moderate who could help the high court 
speak with a unified voice on major public issues. 
</P>
<P>
 He also sought to show the human side of Breyer, whom associates have 
described as cordial but somewhat aloof. Even Clinton did not warm up to Breyer 
last year when the judge was runner-up for the court seat now occupied by 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Clinton passed over Breyer after an interview in 
which aides later said there had been little "chemistry" between the two men. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was interpreted as a sign of his desire for a consensus builder on the 
court, Clinton stressed the importance of the unanimity of the famous Brown vs. 
Board of Education ruling that outlawed school desegregation. His remarks 
indicated a belief in the need for a court that avoids ambiguity in its ruling 
by speaking with one voice. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice is not inconsistent with his own political style of seeking 
consensus on major policy questions. 
</P>
<P>
 In what may be symbolic of their relationship so far, Clinton's efforts to 
bond with Breyer on Sunday and Monday were partly stymied by amusing snags and 
missed communications. The White House van sent to Washington National Airport 
to pick up Breyer and his family on Sunday failed to locate him. Breyer cruised 
the airport in a taxi until he linked up with the official transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer and his family spent Sunday night at the White House. Monday morning, 
Breyer, an avid runner and cyclist, was scheduled to jog with Clinton, but the 
two failed once again to make the connection and the President left the White 
House without him. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked by reporters where Breyer was, Clinton replied: "I don't know where 
he is. I thought he was going with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Two miles into a three-mile run, Clinton suddenly stopped in front of the 
Capitol to await his guest, who arrived in a Secret Service vehicle. The two 
then jogged back to the White House, where they performed stretching exercises 
together on the South Lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Rose Garden ceremony at midday, Clinton said that the case for Breyer's 
confirmation is "clear and compelling." 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to his extraordinary intellectual talents, Judge Breyer will 
bring to the court an abiding sense of decency and unswerving dedication to 
ensuring liberty and justice for all," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will consider the 
Breyer nomination in the next few weeks, looked on approvingly as Clinton and 
Breyer spoke. The Boston judge's chief sponsor, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.), and conservative Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said they were 
delighted with the appointment and predicted easy confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 The only sour note was struck by liberal Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), 
who said he had "strong reservations and deep concerns" about the appointment 
because Breyer appeared to favor corporate over consumer rights in a number of 
antitrust decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzenbaum also complained that Clinton should not have allowed Hatch's 
opposition to scuttle the appointment of Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to 
the court. It appeared last week that Clinton was on the verge of naming 
Babbitt to the seat being vacated by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, but backed away 
after being told of the opposition of several key Western senators, including 
Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzenbaum said he is withholding judgment on whether he will vote to confirm 
Breyer until he has heard his testimony.

 Babbitt took pains to show that he is happy in his job and has the President's 
firm support. 
</P>
<P>
 At a morning meeting for all Interior Department employees, Babbitt was 
introduced by deputy White House Chief of Staff Phil Lader, who told employees 
of Clinton's "excitement" about Babbitt's work and praised the "willingness he 
has to continue serving his President." Babbitt bounded down a lengthy aisle to 
a standing ovation, pumping hands and hugging employees along the way.

 In his remarks at the White House, Breyer paid tribute to his wife, Joanna, a 
clinical psychologist, his three children and his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only wish, too, naturally, there could be sitting here my father, who spent 
40 years helping to administer the public school system of San Francisco, and 
my mother, who taught us by example that the education of her children meant so 
very much more than material comforts," the jurist said. "And, of course, her 
father, who came in 1900 to Ellis Island. he was a cobbler from Poland. I mean, 
he wouldn't have believed today." 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer ducked questions about his judicial philosophy and his views on 
abortion.

PATH CLEARED FOR ABORTION PILL USE; MEDICINE: FRENCH MAKER OF RU-486 GIVES 
PATENT RIGHTS TO A NONPROFIT GROUP. TESTING, FDA APPROVAL ARE REQUIRED TO MEET 
GOAL OF LICENSING DRUG IN U.S. BY 1996.

 In a move designed to speed U.S. development of the RU-486 abortion pill, the 
French manufacturer donated its patent rights to a nonprofit group Monday, with 
a view toward clinical trials and licensing of the drug in the United States by 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Roussel-Uclaf gave its patent rights to the Population Council, an 
international nonprofit organization engaged in scientific research. The 
council will conduct the tests and select an American company to produce the 
abortion pill. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual arrangement, encouraged by the Clinton Administration, overcomes a 
major obstacle to widespread use of RU-486 in this country. The manufacturer, 
along with its German parent company, Hoechst AG, had refused to market the 
drug here largely out of fear that anti-abortion advocates would boycott its 
other products. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug must be declared safe and effective by the Food and Drug 
Administration before it can be made available in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's development marked an extraordinary turnaround since the George Bush 
Administration banned importation of RU-486 in 1992. As a sign of the depth of 
the controversy, Roussel-Uclaf still declined to market the drug here even 
after President Clinton overturned the ban in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Population Council, which was established in 1952, has its headquarters in 
New York City and offices in 16 other nations. It has developed six major 
contraceptive methods now in worldwide use and favors access to safe, effective 
abortions for women, especially in developing nations. Its chairman is McGeorge 
Bundy, White House national security adviser during the Democratic 
administrations of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this action is an important step toward providing the women of 
America with non-surgical alternatives to pregnancy termination," said Donna 
Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who has tried to make the drug available in this 
country, said clinical trials involving 2,000 women at 12 U.S. sites would 
begin this fall, followed by an application to the FDA for approval. The drug 
also is being tested for treatment of breast cancer and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its use as an abortion pill, RU-486 may have applications as a 
"morning-after pill" to prevent pregnancy. Tests to determine its safety and 
usefulness in that respect are under way at UC San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyden said RU-486 -- formally known as mifepristone -- has been used for 
abortions in the first seven weeks of pregnancy by 150,000 women in France, 
Britain and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very hopeful that American women can get this drug early in 1996," he 
said at a news conference. "The days of stalling and foot-dragging on this 
issue are over." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of abortion condemned the agreement and questioned whether RU-486 is 
a safer alternative to surgical abortion. Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.), a 
leader of anti-abortion forces in Congress, said women adversely affected by 
the drug would not be able to recover damages from a nonprofit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "That should be a red flag to any woman who thinks this newest form of baby 
poisoning is safe," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler said his agency has encouraged the filing of 
a new drug application for RU-486. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a safe and effective medical alternative to any surgical 
procedure, American women should have access to that drug regimen," Kessler 
said Monday at a hearing on RU-486 conducted by the House Small Business 
subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kessler added words of caution: "Women should not think that pregnancy 
termination using a medical regimen will be simple. It will not be." 
</P>
<P>
 RU-486 works by blocking the development of progesterone, a hormone essential 
for maintaining pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, the drug typically is dispensed in a doctor's office or clinic. Two 
days later, a woman receives a dose of prostaglandin, a hormone that causes 
contractions that expel the embryo. The woman then must be monitored for 
complications, including excessive bleeding. She also must have a follow-up 
visit in a week to ensure that the abortion has been successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We anticipate that any use of RU-486 in the United States would have to 
follow the same type of strict distribution and use conditions," Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents said the drug would be less invasive than surgical abortion, 
reducing the risk of infections and damage to the cervix or uterus. 
</P>
<P>
 The first clinical trials on RU-486 were conducted in 1983 at the University 
of Southern California. It was then made available in France in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton overturned the ban on RU-486 two days after taking office, directing 
Shalala to devise a strategy for promoting the testing and licensing of the 
drug here. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations between the French manufacturer and the Population Council 
dragged on for more than a year until Shalala set a May 15 deadline, producing 
the agreement announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Catley-Carlson, president of the Population Council, said in a 
statement that her organization is "exhilarated" by the outcome of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident we will be able to arrange for manufacture and distribution 
in the United States," she said. "We plan to move quickly to arrange for 
financing, insurance, manufacture and distribution so that all will be in place 
by the time we receive FDA approval." 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion rights supporters hailed the agreement as a long-delayed triumph for 
medical science over politics. Abortion opponents, however, said the drug may 
be too risky. 
</P>
<P>
 "This milestone victory will significantly increase abortion access and 
fundamentally reshape abortion debate by finally providing American women with 
the only known form of early abortion," said Eleanor Smeal, president of the 
Feminist Majority Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Judie Brown, president of American Life League, Inc., declared: "This 
chemical effectively kills children who live in the womb and is not safe for 
the mother, according to many scientific reports. . . . The Clinton 
Administration is so dedicated to killing human beings who live in the womb 
that they are now prepared to jeopardize the lives of those babies' mothers as 
well."

ARMENIA, AZERBAIJAN AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE; CAUCASUS: MOSCOW BROKERS TRUCE IN 
FORMER SOVIET UNION'S LONGEST-RUNNING CONFLICT. BUT FIGHTING CONTINUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Armenians and Azerbaijanis agreed Monday to a Russian-brokered cease-fire that 
offers a fragile hope of stopping the longest-running ethnic war in the former 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of other such truces have collapsed almost immediately in the bloody, 
six-year struggle over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. And even as 
representatives of the warring parties were signing the pact in Moscow on 
Monday, fighting was reported on the northeastern front in violation of a 
cease-fire reached less than two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Monday's truce is the first to attempt the physical separation of the 
combatants in stages: First comes the cease-fire, which was scheduled to take 
effect at midnight Monday. Next, all troops are to withdraw three to six miles 
from the front by May 25. Then, 49 observer posts, commanded by Russians, will 
be set up to monitor the cease-fire, and 1,800 peacekeeping troops are to be 
brought in to police the resulting buffer zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenian officials also agreed, in principle, to return some of the 
Azerbaijani territory seized in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most productive meeting between the sides for six years," Armenian 
Embassy spokesman Gamlet Gushyan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev hosted the peace talks, in keeping 
with Russia's attempt to be a bigger player in peacemaking efforts in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Middle East and especially the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-way pact is expected to be signed today by Grachev, Armenian Defense 
Minister Serzhik Sarkisyan, Azerbaijani Defense Minister Mamedrafi Mamedov and 
Samvel Babayan, chief of the Nagorno-Karabakh armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt -- this is an extraordinary agreement," said Konstantin E. 
Voyevodsky, an expert on Karabakh. "There has never been such a cease-fire 
before, with observation posts and peacekeeping forces. . . . We can assume 
that the peacekeeper -- Russia -- is more serious now than it was before." 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction in Azerbaijan, which has been taking a drubbing for the past 
year, was cooler. Evinch Abdulayeva, of the Azerinform news agency in Baku, 
described Azerbaijani public opinion as split between hawks and doves. 
Abdulayeva expressed doubt that Azerbaijani soldiers on the front lines would 
respect the cease-fire signed in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Others reacted with dismay. "This is not so much an agreement as an act of 
capitulation by Azerbaijan," said Arif Yusunov, a military historian and 
Azerbaijani opposition figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Yusunov said the peacekeepers -- from Russia and possibly other members of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, and commanded by Grachev's deputy -- are a 
far cry from the true, international peacekeeping force that Azerbaijan had 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil-rich republic, with linguistic and cultural ties to Turkey, joined the 
commonwealth only last winter and has bridled at allowing Russian troops back 
on its soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russians are no guarantor of peace," Yusunov said. "The Russian army can 
easily be bought for dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Azerbaijani opposition parties have branded as "a traitor" the chairman of the 
Parliament, who signed the cease-fire hammered out May 6 in Bishkek, 
Kyrgyzstan, and lawmakers are gathering signatures to replace him, Yusunov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenia and Azerbaijan are both staggering under the economic strain of the 
war that has taken up to 15,000 lives on both sides in the six years since the 
mostly Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh began lobbying the Soviet Union 
for independence from Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Azerbaijan is flooded with refugees from the estimated 650,000 people 
who have been forced to flee their homes -- up to 50,000 this spring alone, the 
International Committee of the Red Cross has estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet each side continues to brace itself for more. Azerbaijani President Gaidar 
Aliyev has reportedly hired about 1,000 Afghan moujahedeen mercenaries to 
bolster his army. And though Armenia claims that its troops are not involved in 
fighting commanded from Karabakh, a group called the Armenian National Army has 
reportedly been dragging young men out of Armenia proper to fight in 
neighboring Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the Council of Security and Cooperation in Europe's Minsk 
group, which has conducted countless failed negotiations, was quoted by 
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency as saying that a settlement of the conflict is 
closer than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliyev reportedly agreed, noting that "once Baku realized the importance of 
reconciliation, one can say that we have approached a final solution of this 
problem," the agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, Grachev dodged a question from the Azerbaijani defense 
minister about the return of lands seized by Armenians.

BACKERS OF ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT PETITION DELIVER SIGNATURES; INITIATIVE: 
SUPPORTERS CLAIM THEY HAVE ENOUGH NAMES STATEWIDE TO QUALIFY THE TOUGH MEASURE 
FOR THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. 
</P>

 Bolstered by volunteers in Orange County, supporters of proposal to bar 
illegal immigrants in California from public hospitals and schools announced 
Monday they had enough signatures to qualify the initiative for the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing "Save Our State" buttons, supporters, including sponsors and authors 
of the initiative, gathered Monday at the Orange County registrar of voter's 
office in Santa Ana to greet delivery of 124,000 signatures. Statewide, 
initiative backers delivered 600,000 signatures to election offices, more than 
the 384,974 required to put the initiative before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative -- among the most stringent proposals put forth in the 
increasingly contentious immigration debate -- is sponsored by Alan Nelson, 
Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner under President Ronald 
Reagan, and Harold Ezell, INS chief for the Western states from 1983 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the initiative would require schools to verify the immigration 
status of pupils and expel students whose parents cannot prove their legal 
status. Schools also would be required to report to law enforcement agencies 
the names of parents they believe are in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 It would eliminate prenatal care to women who have no papers. Illegal 
immigrants could receive emergency care, but hospital officials would be 
required to report "persons who are apparent illegal aliens." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've allowed California to be a welfare state for illegals too long," Ezell 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Arcadia), who backs the initiative, said at 
a press conference in Santa Ana: "The Legislature in Sacramento for many years 
has failed to act on this issue. If the Legislature will not act, we will act . 
. . We don't want any illegals here, regardless of where they are from." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kiley, Orange County political strategist for the petition drive, said 
the recent debate on earthquake aid for immigrants focused attention on the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, who has made unlawful immigration a centerpiece of his 
reelection campaign, has said that illegal immigrants and their U.S.-born 
children absorb $3 billion in education, health care, prison and welfare costs. 
Critics say the numbers ignore the economic activity and tax revenue generated 
by illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson has not taken a position on the initiative, which has been endorsed 
by the state GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Poll in March found that 62% of respondents favor the proposed 
initiative, including a majority of Democrats. The Democratic Party has not 
taken a position on the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be a knee-jerk reaction to 'Yes, let's do something about this 
problem,' " said Arturo Vargas, vice president of the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund. "I don't think people yet have the benefit of an 
analysis of how onerous this kind of Big Brother initiative is." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas said the initiative could lead to widespread discrimination against 
legal immigrants and even U.S. citizens of Latino descent. "If you're brown, 
you're going to be suspect in this state." 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Montez, president of the Orange County chapter of the League of United 
Latin American Citizens, said Monday that the group will seek an investigation 
by the secretary of state into the validity of the initiative signatures and 
petitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "LULAC will not stand by if this passes," he continued. "We feel it is 
unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative drive got off to a slow start -- petitions have been in 
circulation since January -- but received a big boost from the state Republican 
Party, which spent $75,000 to send out petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Court challenges seem certain if the initiative goes on the ballot and is 
voted into law. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure's educational restrictions seem to contradict a landmark 1982 
Supreme Court decision, Plyler v. Doe, which held that public schools must 
accept children regardless of immigration status. Initiative proponents 
acknowledge their desire to revisit that Supreme Court ruling, which passed by 
a 5-4 majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants do not qualify for welfare and many other public benefit 
programs, but those who are indigent can receive free emergency and prenatal 
care at public hospitals. Their children are legally guaranteed public school 
education, and, if the children are U.S. citizens, they are eligible for 
welfare.

1 TOURIST SLAIN, 1 WOUNDED AT SCENIC LOOKOUT; CRIME: THE GERMAN COUPLE ARE SHOT 
DURING A ROBBERY AT A MOUNTAIN TURNOUT NEAR IDYLLWILD. THE MAN, WHO DROVE HALF 
A MILE TO GET HELP, IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION.

<P>
 A German tourist was shot to death and a man thought to be her husband was 
seriously wounded in an apparent robbery Monday afternoon at a scenic turnout 
on a mountain highway seven miles north of here, Riverside County sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite severe bullet wounds in his face and shoulder, the man managed to 
stagger to his rented car and drive about half a mile to a picnic area, where 
he attracted the attention of passersby, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the man, who could not speak English, wrote a note saying, 
"I am German," and managed to indicate through gestures that he and the woman 
with him had been robbed and shot. The man was flown by helicopter to Desert 
Hospital in Palm Springs, where he was reported in critical condition Monday 
night after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Details about the attack -- including the identities of the victims -- were 
not immediately available, in large part because police still had limited 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the information we need is hinging on his recovery and our talking to 
him through a translator," said Riverside County Sheriff's Deputy Mark Lohman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman said investigators had no reason to believe the victims were targeted 
because they were foreign tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the crime was reminiscent of a series of attacks in Florida since 
October, 1992, that claimed the lives of nine foreigners, including four 
Germans, and rocked the state's $31-billion-a-year tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a hotel bus carrying five Norwegians was hijacked in Miami by two 
men who robbed passengers of their money and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, two Japanese students were shot to death during a robbery in a San 
Pedro parking lot, reviving Japanese concerns about the safety of foreign 
visitors in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County officials declined to disclose where the German couple were 
staying or how they happened to be in the San Jacinto Mountains, but Lohman 
said their drive along Highway 243 -- the winding, two-lane mountain road 
between Banning and Idyllwild -- was part of a day trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman said the couple apparently parked their rented sedan at Indian Vista 
Point -- a popular turnout north of Idyllwild that overlooks the San Jacinto 
Valley -- and walked about 50 yards up an asphalt path to a large pine tree 
where the attack occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The base of the pine tree is screened from the highway and parking lot by a 
knoll, so it is unlikely that anyone driving by would have seen the attack, 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies declined to discuss how many people are believed to have been 
involved in the attack, how they escaped or whether they may have left the man 
and woman for dead. Investigators said only that the man's wallet was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman said that after the severely wounded man reached the Lake Fulmore 
picnic ground and summoned help, someone drove him back to the scenic turnout 
in a futile attempt to help the mortally wounded woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver contacted sheriff's deputies by cellular phone, and the deputies 
called in the helicopter that flew the man to Desert Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The German Consulate in Los Angeles declined comment on the attack, saying it 
had not been contacted officially about the incident.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; HAYDEN CALLS FOR A TAX SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS 
ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing his attack on politics as usual, state Sen. Tom Hayden on Monday 
called for an overhaul of the state's tax system so that consumption would be 
taxed more than income, providing incentives for Californians to conserve 
energy and protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to an audience of 75 at the Commonwealth Club in downtown San 
Francisco, the Democratic candidate for governor proposed the tax restructuring 
as part of a broader "dream" for a new California based on the "unfulfilled 
agenda of the 1960s." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said that in his dream, education would be the state's top priority, 
diversity would be seen as an asset and economic recovery would be achieved "by 
restoring the environment, not degrading it." 
</P>
<P>
 But that dream won't come true, Hayden said, if voters choose state Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown or Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi as the Democratic 
nominee in the June 7 primary. Hayden said that because his opponents receive 
campaign contributions from special interests, they will not take the action 
needed to ensure effective change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The oil industry has spent $17 million on campaigns and lobbying in 
California since 1991, largely attempting to thwart any shift toward renewable 
resources or alternative forms of transportation," said the 54-year-old 
legislator who is accepting single contributions of no more than $94. Special 
interests like that, he said, "are lobbying against our future." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden's campaign is built around calling attention to the power of lobbyists 
in Sacramento. His 13-minute campaign advertisement, airing on cable stations 
around the state, claims to give voters a realistic glimpse of how special 
interests create what Hayden calls a "dysfunctional" government. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hayden has conceded that he does not expect to win the primary, he has 
been tireless in his attempts to use his position as candidate to prod voters 
into getting more involved. Monday's speech, in which Hayden urged his 
listeners to "embrace a new politics of the spirit," was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden skewered Gov. Pete Wilson's new campaign advertisement about illegal 
immigration that begins with a picture of people running across the border 
while a narrator says, "They keep coming." Hayden accused Wilson of playing on 
fear and using illegal immigrants as scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden got a warm reception from the group of mostly professional people. At 
one point the room burst into spontaneous applause, when he described the 
priorities of his budget plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education first. Reduce student fees by 20%. And reduce 'three strikes' to 
violent offenders, which will reduce 70% of the cost," Hayden said, referring 
to the measure that punishes three-time felony offenders with mandatory prison 
terms of 25 years to life. "I would not sign a budget that funded 'three 
strikes' in expanded form by closing college doors and shrinking education." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden concluded his remarks with a call for compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The final message of my dream is that we must realize that life is not about 
conquering other people or other frontiers but about finding meaning in our own 
lives," he said. "Now that the old frontiers are being exhausted, the agenda of 
the inner frontier calls us to be present and focused."

 Hayden said the question before California "is that posed by Rodney King 
during the violence of 1992: 'Can we all just get along?' Our destiny depends 
on how well we answer that question. If we remain in the grip of old answers 
and old politics, we will fail."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; GOLD MINE JOB POLISHES OFF GARAMENDI'S 
58-COUNTY WORK STINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Democrat John Garamendi sank to record depths in his campaign for governor 
Monday. He descended 2,200 feet into a Mother Lode gold mine to work alongside 
the miners. 
</P>
<P>
 The work of the state insurance commissioner was somewhat inhibited by the 
flexible cast he wore on a broken right leg, but Garamendi managed to reach his 
goal of working alongside people in their jobs in each of California's 58 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, in rubber boots and a hard hat with a headlamp, used a shovel to 
help clear a mine car track of debris. Then he operated a pneumatic chute to 
fill two cars with chunks of ore. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 4, Garamendi flew to Crescent City, just south of the Oregon border, 
to begin his campaign to work a variety of jobs with ordinary Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra County, the 58th and last, came Monday as he visited the Original 
Sixteen-to-One Mine at Alleghany, about 100 miles northeast of Sacramento. The 
mine has been operating off and on for nearly a century. About 25 miles of 
shafts and tunnels, reaching a maximum depth of 2,400 feet, honeycomb the 
Sierra foothills here. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said it was important to him as a potential governor to learn the 
problems facing firms like the Sixteen-to-One and its 22 employees, such as 
safety and environmental regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political experts have said it was a mistake for Garamendi to spend so 
much time working odd jobs, many of them in thinly populated rural areas with 
few voters. But Garamendi called it a matter of "personal dedication" to learn 
firsthand the problems facing such companies and workers. 
</P>
<P>
 With three weeks until the June 7 primary, Garamendi is fighting an uphill 
battle against the better-financed Kathleen Brown, the state treasurer. State 
Sen. Tom Hayden also is seeking the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sixteen-to-One, named for William Jennings Bryan's 19th-Century proposal 
to fix the price of gold at 16 times the price of silver, is one of the few 
productive and profitable underground gold mining operations left in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President Michael Miller told Garamendi that a revival of the mine 
began in 1974, aided by metal detectors to find gold in quartz veins that was 
overlooked by the first miners. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is preparing to sink a new shaft into virgin territory between 
2,400 and 2,600 feet below ground. Workers have mined as much as $1.5 million 
worth of gold in a single day within the past two years, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi and other visitors Monday got to the 2,200-foot level by riding four 
at a time in a skip, a form of metal bucket suspended from a cable and operated 
from a hoist. The skip first descended at about a 60-degree angle, then plunged 
nearly straight down for the rest of the five-minute trip through a darkened 
shaft about five feet square. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 feet from where Garamendi worked Monday, miner Randall Yager touched 
off a dynamite blast in a side cavern. An hour later, he emerged with a small 
sackful of sparkling quartz rocks that contained, by his estimate, about $4,000 
worth of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Yager found a pocket with about 15 ounces of gold, nearly $6,000 
worth at current prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an Easter egg hunt," one miner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said his family "never should have left the mines" that it operated 
in the area near Mokelumne Hill, which is where he broke his leg earlier this 
month when he fell from a ladder.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN ASSAILS WILSON BUDGET AS $3 BILLION IN 
RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown on Monday described Gov. Pete Wilson's proposed 
budget as "a lie" and called on Wilson to get realistic about how big a federal 
bailout the state can expect to receive in the coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a Democratic candidate for governor, said the state has a permanent, 
$3-billion deficit and no credible plan to reduce it. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Legislature passes Wilson's budget as proposed, she said, she may have 
to borrow more than $10 billion from private investors to get the state through 
the 1994-95 fiscal year -- at a cost of more than $300 million in short-term 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the way the state of California should be managing its finances," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the harsh critique, Brown suggested no specific alternative to the 
$55-billion budget Wilson proposed in January. The governor is expected to 
offer an updated plan Friday in an annual event that usually triggers the first 
serious discussion about the budget in the halls of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson spokesman rapped Brown for not offering a plan of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be more than happy to entertain any alternative budget proposal she 
would put forth that specifies either what spending cuts she'd make or what 
taxes she'd increase," said H. D. Palmer, assistant director of finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was scheduled Monday to meet with legislative leaders and with a team of 
private financial advisers. She said she would make public today some options 
for the state to consider, but she said those choices would focus on financing 
the debt and would not include proposed budget cuts or tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Those decisions, she said, are the responsibility of the Legislature and the 
governor, not the treasurer, even one running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The crux of the problem, Brown said, is Wilson's reliance on $3.1 billion in 
new federal funds, most of it to cover the cost of providing health, education 
and prison cells to illegal immigrants. Clinton Administration sources and 
members of Congress have said federal funds totaling about $500 million might 
be more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she supports Wilson's request but criticized him for depending on 
the money to balance his budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The budget as presented by Gov. Pete Wilson is a lie," Brown said. "It is 
fiscally irresponsible to attempt to balance the budget on hopes and prayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer of the Wilson Administration said the request for immigration funds was 
both realistic and responsible. The request amounts to nearly 10% of the 
state's general fund.

2 STATE OFFICIALS REFUSE TO TESTIFY ON FAILED DMV COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two state officials refused Monday to testify under oath at a legislative 
hearing called to try to find out how and why $44 million was spent over the 
past seven years on a DMV computer project that will not work. 
</P>
<P>
 The two officials, Steve Kolodney and Dennis Walker, were involved in the 
computer project at the Department of Motor Vehicles during its development in 
the late 1980s, left the state payroll for private work in the computer 
business for about a year, and then returned to state employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, a career civil servant and former DMV computer project manager, told 
the fact-finding hearing of the Assembly Transportation Committee that he 
believed the investigation was a "witch hunt." Kolodney, a gubernatorial 
appointee, said he would not testify until he received legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The refusal by Kolodney, director of the state Office of Information 
Technology, and Walker, chief of a statewide welfare computer system in the 
Department of Social Services, took the legislators by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, who last week promised the cooperation of 
his Administration in determining how the failed project consumed $44 million, 
said: "Any decision not to testify is a personal decision and not one that was 
made by the Administration. We were not in communication with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Committee hearing was the first full-blown effort by the 
Legislature to learn how so many public dollars could be sunk into a computer 
expansion that flopped without anyone apparently sounding the alarm until 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was aimed at redeveloping the department's antiquated databases of 
driver's licenses and vehicle information so the department could meet 
increasing demands of law enforcement, courts, insurance companies and the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
 As conceived in the 1980s, when the DMV's equipment was then 20 years old, the 
database conversion was estimated to cost about $28 million. For reasons that 
are unclear, the project spun out of control. It was only a few months ago that 
current DMV Director Frank Zolin concluded, after an expenditure of $44 
million, that it would never work and abandoned the project. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset of Monday's hearing, committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) 
announced that witnesses would be placed under oath, an unusual procedure for 
legislative committees. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was concerned about an apparent "revolving door" in which state 
employees involved in the DMV's computer overhaul left state service to work in 
the computer industry and then returned to sensitive positions in state 
government involving computer operations. 
</P>
<P>
 He produced documents that showed that Kolodney left the Office of Information 
Technology late in 1989 to invest in and work for a consulting company known as 
Government Technology Group headed by Sacramento lobbyist Michael Franchetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolodney returned to the information technology office, which oversees 
expenditures on computer systems, in 1991. He told the Fair Political Practices 
Commission that he had no conflict of interest, although he remained a 
stockholder in Franchetti's business. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker was the manager of the DMV project starting in 1986. He left the DMV to 
work for Tandem Computers Inc., late in 1990. At about the same time, Tandem 
was awarded an $11.9-million contract to supply the DMV with computer hardware 
without competitive bidding, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker and Kolodney were called as witnesses shortly after Legislative Analyst 
Elizabeth Hill told the committee that no one in either Wilson's Administration 
or the former George Deukmejian Administration had waved a warning flag that 
the project was in trouble. Her investigators discovered the failure in 
February, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker told Katz he would not testify under oath because the tone of a Katz 
letter seeking his testimony indicated that "this clearly would be a witch 
hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Kolodney said that without legal guidance, "I don't believe it 
would be in my best interest to testify under oath." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he could compel them to testify, but said forced testimony would 
have the effect of immunizing the two men in case the DMV scandal developed 
into a criminal prosecution. "It's not appropriate for us to grant immunity 
from prosecution," he said.

IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE TOPS SIGNATURE GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON and PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a strong push from the Republican Party, supporters of a proposal to bar 
illegal immigrants in California from public hospitals and schools announced 
Monday that they had enough signatures to qualify the initiative for the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the sweeping "Save Our State" measure wheeled into election 
offices boxes stuffed with more than 600,000 signatures -- more than the 
384,974 required to put the initiative before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The signatures will be checked and if the measure qualifies, it is certain to 
raise the intensity of an immigration debate that has become the subject of TV 
ads in the governor's race and mailers in legislative contests throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant rights advocates are scrambling to come up with a strategy in 
response, including possibly airing TV ads promoting the positive side of 
immigration and highlighting what critics call the intolerant and xenophobic 
nature of the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative -- among the most stringent proposals put forth in the 
increasingly contentious immigration debate -- is sponsored by Alan Nelson, 
Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner under President Ronald 
Reagan, and Harold Ezell, INS chief for the western states from 1983-89. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the initiative would require schools to verify the immigration 
status of pupils and expel students whose parents cannot prove their legal 
status. Schools also would be required to report to law enforcement agencies 
the names of parents they believe are in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 It would eliminate prenatal care to women who have no papers. Illegal 
immigrants could receive emergency care, but hospital officials would be 
required to report "persons who are apparent illegal aliens." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, who has made unlawful immigration a centerpiece of his 
reelection campaign, has said that illegal immigrants and their U.S.-born 
children absorb $3 billion in education, health care, prison and welfare costs. 
Critics say the numbers ignore the economic activity and tax revenue generated 
by illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson has not taken a position on the initiative, which has been endorsed 
by the state GOP. His campaign manager, George Gorton, said in a letter to 
initiative proponents that it is "highly likely" that the governor will 
campaign for the measure next fall should it make the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Poll in March found that 62% of respondents favor the proposed 
initiative, including a majority of Democrats. The Democratic Party has not 
taken a position on the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be a knee-jerk reaction to 'Yes, let's do something about this 
problem,' " said Arturo Vargas, vice president of the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund. "I don't think people yet have the benefit of an 
analysis of how onerous this kind of Big Brother initiative is." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas said the initiative could lead to widespread discrimination against 
legal immigrants and U.S. citizens of Latino descent. "If you're brown, you're 
going to be suspect in this state." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative drive got off to a slow start -- petitions have been in 
circulation since January -- but received a big boost from the state Republican 
Party, which spent $75,000 to send out petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 State GOP Chairman Tirso del Junco, a Cuban immigrant, said he "takes care of 
a lot of illegal immigrants" in his medical practice, and "they are taking jobs 
away from legal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the initiative boasted of strong grass-roots support, but they 
hired a professional signature-gathering firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure's educational restrictions seem to contradict a landmark 1982 
Supreme Court decision (Plyler vs. Doe), which held that public schools must 
accept children regardless of immigration status. Initiative proponents 
acknowledge their desire to revisit that Supreme Court ruling, which passed 5 
to 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants do not qualify for welfare and many other public benefit 
programs but those who are indigent can receive free emergency and prenatal 
care at public hospitals.

APPEALS COURT REVERSES MAN'S DEATH SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court Monday reversed the death penalty of a San Bernardino 
man convicted more than a decade ago of the brutal murder of his 10-year-old 
stepdaughter, after concluding that the man's defense lawyer had virtually 
invited the jury to send his client to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco 
ruled that Melvin M. Wade's attorney had provided grossly ineffective 
representation, violating Wade's constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the majority cited San Bernardino attorney S. Donald Ames' 
closing argument during the trial, in which he said that Wade couldn't "live 
with that beast from within any longer" and that a death sentence might be "the 
gift of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames' argument "effectively relieved the jury of any doubt or anguish it might 
feel in sentencing Wade to death," Judge William C. Canby Jr. wrote. The judge 
said Ames had no legitimate reason to argue that "executing Wade would be an 
outcome favorable to Wade." 
</P>
<P>
 Canby, joined by Appellate Judge Stephen Reinhardt, said Ames also failed to 
introduce evidence that Wade had been physically and sexually abused as a 
child, "a potentially forceful mitigating circumstance." Moreover, Canby said 
the only reason Ames offered for saving Wade's life in his closing argument was 
to enable doctors to do a post-mortem examination of this "human guinea pig." 
</P>
<P>
 "Had Wade received a competent defense, a reasonable probability exists that 
the jury would have returned a sentence of life imprisonment without the 
possibility of parole" rather than a death sentence, Canby wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhardt added: "Few capital defendants can engage the services of a Clarence 
Darrow. But surely they are entitled to more than the wholly ineffective 
representation Wade received." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority judges said that even if Ames had presented an adequate defense, 
Wade's sentence had to be reversed because the trial judge gave deficient 
instructions to the jury on the elements of "torture murder," the crime for 
which the death penalty was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhardt agreed with Canby on both grounds for reversal and would have gone 
further, contending that the conviction should be reversed as well because of 
Ames' inadequate performance during the first phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Appellate Judge Stephen S. Trott wrote a vigorous dissent, saying that the 
jury instructions were sufficient and that Wade's lawyer had presented an 
adequate defense, including a legitimate but unsuccessful effort to garner 
juror sympathy for his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wade's counsel did the best he could with the little he had," Trott wrote. He 
said a death sentence for Wade was virtually assured from the moment Wade 
turned himself in to police and said: "Here I am. I am the one you want. I 
guess I hit her too hard. I guess I hit her too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 On April 10, 1981, Wade killed Joyce Tolliver in a brutal assault after 
accusing her of smelling and not properly washing herself, according to trial 
testimony. Over a 22-hour period spanning two days, Wade punched her, hit her 
with a board, confined her in a duffel bag, slammed her head into a wall with 
sufficient force to penetrate the wall and finally stomped her to death, 
shouting that he was "Michael the Archangel" killing "a devil." 
</P>
<P>
 At a 1982 trial, Ames introduced testimony that an alternate personality 
called "Othello" was living inside Wade's body and that "Othello" actually 
tortured and killed Tolliver. But jurors rejected this contention and others, 
finding him legally sane. 
</P>
<P>
 After several years of state appeals, Wade's death sentence was reversed by 
the California Supreme Court in 1987. But the sentence was reinstated the 
following year by the same court after Chief Justice Rose Bird and two other 
liberal justices had been turned out of office by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade, now 37, then began his federal appeals, which initially were spurned by 
federal District Judge Manuel L. Real in Los Angeles, setting the stage for 
Monday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy California Atty. Gen. Pat Zaharopoulos said the agency is likely to ask 
the 9th Circuit for a rehearing by a panel of 11 judges. Failing that, the 
state is likely to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. "It's really disappointing 
that we lost" the jury instruction issue, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There currently are 383 people on Death Row in California. "Prior to today, 
Wade was in the group of cases that would be at the top of the list" for 
execution, said Dane Gillette, the attorney general's death penalty 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The practical effect of the ruling is to delay Wade's execution for at least 
months and perhaps to ultimately void it. If the decision stands, he would be 
entitled to a new trial on whether the murder was intentional and involved the 
infliction of torture, said Deputy State Public Defender Donald J. Ayoob, who 
represented Wade on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judges left the conviction of first-degree murder undisturbed, but they 
removed the special circumstance that makes the case a capital crime. I'm quite 
pleased with the result," Ayoob said. 
</P>
<P>
 Canby said the trial judge's instructions on torture murder improperly 
expanded its definition and may have influenced the jurors' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Trott dismissed that contention and also challenged the majority on Ames' 
competence. "Counsel never argued that executing Wade would be a favorable 
outcome. Counsel was resolutely pursuing his 'the demon did it' theme, and the 
idea that Wade deserved sympathy and compassion, not death," Trott wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 During the penalty phase of the trial, Ames had Wade testify in the voice of 
"Othello." Canby said the profane testimony invited the jurors to issue a death 
sentence. But Trott said the testimony was a strong showing of how mentally 
disturbed Wade was. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Ames said he was pleased that the death penalty had been 
reversed but added that he was disturbed at the majority's assessment of his 
performance: "They interpreted what I argued as an invitation to put Melvin to 
death. Nothing can be further from the truth. Never at any time during the 
trial did I believe that the death penalty was warranted because I had 
firsthand knowledge that Melvin was a very sick person."

FBI SETTLES SUIT FOR SEX HARASSMENT; CIVIL RIGHTS: TWO WOMEN AGENTS TO RECEIVE 
NEARLY $350,000 IN UNUSUALLY SWIFT RESOLUTION. PERSONAL ROLE BY AGENCY DIRECTOR 
IS CREDITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusually swift resolution to a civil rights lawsuit, the FBI has agreed 
to pay nearly $350,000 to two women agents who alleged that they were fondled 
and taunted by their Orange County supervisor, a lawyer for the women said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement agreement, the bureau will pay $192,500 to Agent Heather 
Power-Anderson and $155,000 to her colleague, Boni Carr-Alduenda, in exchange 
for their dropping the lawsuit, Irvine lawyer Christopher B. Mears said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a condition of the settlement, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh will also issue 
a public statement within the next few weeks acknowledging the agreement and 
"reiterating the FBI's commitment to the maintenance of a workplace free from 
all forms of discrimination and retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at FBI headquarters and the Justice Department said they would have 
no comment Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the handling of similar complaints in the past, which took 
months -- even years -- to resolve, the settlement comes two months after the 
women sued the Justice Department alleging that they were repeatedly harassed 
by Supervising Agent John Carpenter, a 20-year-veteran who worked in the 
agency's Santa Ana office. Carpenter has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI initiated proceedings to terminate Carpenter six weeks ago and 
transferred him to the FBI's Long Beach office. 
</P>
<P>
 Mears attributed the speedy resolution to the FBI director's personal 
involvement in securing a negotiated resolution of the women's complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "While not carrying an admission of fault, the agreement clearly reflects the 
seriousness with which the FBI took these claims," Mears said. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson, 38, and Carr-Alduenda, 40, alleged in their lawsuit that 
Carpenter taunted them at work, grabbing them and making lewd remarks during 
several months of 1992.

 Power-Anderson, of Mission Viejo, has been a special agent since 1984. 
Carr-Alduenda, a resident of Laguna Niguel, has served since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson was assigned to Carpenter's squad, and said the supervisor 
massaged her shoulders. In one incident, she said he kissed her on the back of 
the neck while she was sitting at her desk. Another time, she alleged, 
Carpenter tore her dress when he forced his hand onto her upper thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr-Alduenda alleged that Carpenter constantly grabbed her and commented 
several times about the size of her breasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The women also alleged that James Donckels, the resident agent-in-charge of 
the Santa Ana office, discouraged them from filing discrimination complaints 
with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but advised them to 
put their complaints in writing so he could forward them to the Office of 
Professional Responsibility, an internal FBI unit.

CHRISTOPHER SHUTTLES ASSAD'S PEACE SUGGESTIONS TO ISRAEL; MIDEAST: SYRIA 
APPEARS INCREASINGLY SERIOUS ABOUT AN ACCORD ON THE GOLAN HEIGHTS, U.S. 
OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

 Syrian President Hafez Assad sent Israel new, more detailed suggestions for a 
possible peace agreement Monday, and U.S. and Israeli officials said they 
constituted encouraging -- but gradual -- progress in the talks between the two 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria's new ideas were carried from its capital, Damascus, to Jerusalem by 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in a new round of shuttle diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said no breakthrough was imminent. But they said the length and detail 
of Christopher's talks in Damascus suggested that Syria is exploring the 
prospect of peace more seriously than before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at the beginning of a very serious process, in which each element is 
scrutinized with great care," Christopher told reporters before leaving 
Damascus for Israel. "They are exchanging ideas, probing each other on very 
early . . . but important aspects." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Israeli officials said Assad and his foreign minister, Farouk Shareh, 
did not change any basic Syrian positions but offered new details and 
clarifications. They said the Syrian proposals covered the full range of issues 
in the talks, including Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and security 
guarantees for both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a desire to avoid torpedoing the negotiations, the officials refused to 
provide any further specifics. "We're not on the brink of a breakthrough," a 
senior Christopher aide warned. "There's a lot of work to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, both U.S. and Israeli officials appeared encouraged by the once-balky 
Syrians' willingness to begin discussing concrete issues that a Syrian-Israeli 
peace would involve. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has already proposed a deal under which it would withdraw its forces 
from Syria's Golan Heights in three phases over a period of five to eight 
years, in exchange for a progressive establishment of normal economic and 
political relations in the same period. Israel also wants security arrangements 
-- including an international peacekeeping force on the Golan Heights -- to 
give both countries confidence that they will not be attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 In Damascus, Christopher met with Assad for four hours Sunday evening and 
received his response to Israel's proposals, officials said. On Monday morning, 
Christopher delayed his departure for five hours to meet again with Shareh. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday evening, in Jerusalem, Christopher met with Yitzhak Rabin at the 
Israeli prime minister's home after sundown, when the Jewish holiday of Shavuot 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 If Christopher makes progress in Israel, his aides said, he may well shuttle 
back to Damascus later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials said they were particularly intrigued by signals from 
Damascus that Assad is willing to consider a phased withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights over a period of years. Previously, Syria had insisted on a complete 
withdrawal as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis are also interested in discussing the kind of security 
arrangements that could be put in place at the beginning of a withdrawal, they 
said. "This is what we need to have confidence to withdraw," said one. "We want 
to demilitarize not just the Golan, but some of the Syrian territory beyond the 
Golan." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, both Israel and the United States wanted the peace negotiations 
with Syria to be face to face -- not the old-fashioned, U.S.-mediated shuttle 
that Christopher is undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 But after face-to-face talks bogged down in sterile monologues, Israeli and 
U.S. officials have concluded that a shuttle is more likely to succeed -- if 
only because Syria seems more interested in its relationship with the United 
States than in friendship with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an aide noted pointedly, "This process shows Warren Christopher at 
his best: deeply into the details, building trust between them and him, so that 
ultimately he can build trust between the two of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Today Christopher is scheduled to visit Jericho, the West Bank town from which 
Israel withdrew last week, for talks with members of the new Palestinian 
self-governing authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel consented to the hourlong meeting, although some Israeli officials 
worried that it might look as if Christopher was granting a form of recognition 
to leaders of a future Palestinian state.

SOCIAL ISSUES; WOMAN WHO FEEDS 300 POOR CHILDREN FIGHTS CITY HALL; HOUSTON 
HEALTH DEPARTMENT SAYS HER MUCH-LAUDED HOME OPERATION VIOLATES CODES. BOTH 
SIDES ARE ADAMANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As dawn breaks, Carol Porter is in her kitchen, preparing sack lunches for 300 
underprivileged preschoolers who live near her north Houston home. By noon, she 
will deliver the food by van in one of the nation's first meals-on-wheels 
programs for children. 
</P>
<P>
 KidCare began nine years ago as a personally financed crusade against hunger. 
As private donations grew, the program expanded to provide 14,000 meals a month 
to area children. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter operates out of her small wood-frame house, which bulges with five 
refrigerators (two in the living room), three freezers and two stoves. The 
garage -- a combination pantry and kitchen -- is lined with shelves holding 
enormous cans of vegetables, tomato sauce and baby formula. 
</P>
<P>
 And hanging from a refrigerator door are two city health department notices 
listing an array of code violations: The pantry lacks a separate sink to rinse 
out mops, the stove lacks a vent hood, and the exposed beam ceiling must be 
covered. If these and other violations are not corrected, the KidCare pantry 
may have to close its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Porter nor the city is willing to budge. 
</P>
<P>
 To Porter, a registered nurse, the issue isn't sanitation but bureaucratic 
nit-picking that stifles private sector initiative. "I'm endangering the health 
and welfare of children who are eating out of garbage cans? Give me a break." 
</P>
<P>
 And city officials charged with enforcing laws intended to protect residents 
face the public relations nightmare of shutting down a nationally recognized 
program that feeds hungry children. "We believe young children deserve the same 
standards of food quality that anyone in Houston enjoys," says Kathy Barton, a 
health department spokeswoman. "Why should we allow a lower standard for 
vulnerable children than for anyone else?" 
</P>
<P>
 Porter has refused offers by local firms to donate the fixtures. She asks them 
to "save their generosity for our building," a nearby structure bought in 
foreclosure that eventually will be KidCare headquarters. "We're not saying 
lower the standards. Let's modify them so that the average citizen can take the 
initiative and help feed the hungry. Not everyone knows someone willing to 
donate commercial-grade fixtures," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But, observes Barton, "ordinances do not distinguish between a for-profit or 
nonprofit kitchen. You're preparing food for people outside of your home, and 
there's an awful lot of potential for food-borne contaminants." 
</P>
<P>
 Porter started KidCare in 1985, haunted by the memory of neighborhood children 
scavenging for food in a garbage dump behind a McDonald's. For five years, she 
and her husband, Hurt, bought the food with their paychecks and savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal grants that might go to KidCare are steadfastly refused because of the 
regulations involved. "We're not going to ask someone to prove they're poor 
enough to get our help, it's demoralizing," Porter says. "It's not easy to ask 
for food. When someone does, you know they need it. We give assistance with 
dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 As word of KidCare spread, private donors and corporations such as Toys R Us 
began to support the program. Today, KidCare provides lunch and an afternoon 
snack six days a week. A paid staff of four and a small group of volunteers 
help prepare and distribute the meals. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls of Porter's house are decorated with community service awards from 
groups ranging from the Assn. of Black Social Workers to the Houston division 
of the FBI. Last month, Porter went to the White House to accept the 
Presidential Volunteer Action Award. 
</P>
<P>
 She applied for a food service license for the first time in 1993. It was 
granted on the condition that the kitchen be brought up to code. 
</P>
<P>
 When only some of the necessary improvements were made -- such as the 
installation of a stainless steel sink -- health inspectors in February refused 
to issue a renewal. Porter recently found out that her newly donated sink does 
not meet code standards -- it's the wrong size. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are they on my back now when I've been doing this for years and nobody 
said a negative word?" asks Porter, waving letters of commendation from Houston 
Mayor Bob Lanier and City Health Department Director Mary des Vignes-Kendrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Barton says she does not know why the city failed to act until now. But 
another health department employee said that total compliance with the code 
should be beside the point when hungry children regularly poison themselves by 
eating lead-based paint from walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee, who asked not to be identified, said: "I often refer children to 
Carol because I know she will get things done. If she's shut down, there's no 
one else here to fill the vacuum. No one is doing what she does." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, a donated KidCare van loaded with 300 sack lunches made 
more than 20 stops in impoverished neighborhoods within a 10-mile radius of the 
Porters' home. As the driver honked the horn, doors flew open and children of 
all ages ran outside as if the ice cream man had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The children stood patiently in line. Today's lunch is turkey and cheese on 
whole wheat bread, an apple, chocolate wafers and orange juice. Hot lunches of 
spaghetti and hot dogs are often on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Porters make a point to hug and greet parents and children alike. 
"One-on-one is important; it steps out of a certain feeling that they're not 
good enough," Hurt Porter says. 
</P>
<P>
 For the forthright Carol Porter, nothing is off limits if it's in the best 
interest of a child. "Are you taking vitamins? Seeing a doctor? Drinking milk?" 
she badgers a young pregnant woman, who nods proudly. She has heard this line 
of questioning before. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, she chided three teen-age girls who said, "We don't got that." "You 
don't got ?" demanded Porter. "We don't have ," they chimed in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Mendoza, 17, was waiting for the Porters on her porch. "Before, I felt 
like my family was alone," said Mendoza as she collected the lunches for her 
younger brothers. "They didn't even know me that much, but they show love to 
us. It made me feel happy that people care." 
</P>
<P>
 The showdown between the Porters and the Houston health department could come 
to a head if the city issues an injunction to prevent her from distributing 
food. Fines could follow. 
</P>
<P>
 But Porter is unfazed. "If they think I'm going to stop feeding my kids, 
they're nuts," she says.

NEW ITALIAN PREMIER WOOS LAWMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Appealing for a parliamentary vote of confidence, rookie Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi on Monday promised Italians a fairer, more open and efficient 
government based on free-market economics and political dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The billionaire media tycoon, who entered politics earlier this year, must win 
confirming votes from both houses for his new conservative government. His 
coalition, built around federalist and neo-fascist allies, has a clear majority 
in the Chamber of Deputies but not in the Senate, which votes Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the Senate on Monday, the entrepreneur presented a government plan 
that he said would create "a freer, fairer and more modern Italy." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his coalition embodies "the unity and indivisibility" of the country, 
a clear reference to fears awakened by his government partners from the 
Northern League, who sometimes speak of federalizing Italy into three regional 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge this government on facts, not prejudice," he urged. He said his own 
reputation and the checks and balances built into the constitution should 
reassure critics who worry about potential conflicts of interest between his 
official role and his vast business empire. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 55-minute maiden address, the 57-year-old Berlusconi also pledged to 
combat "racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism." 
</P>
<P>
 On a get-acquainted visit to Brussels over the weekend, Antonio Martino, 
Italy's new foreign minister, was careful to assure Italy's European Union 
partners that there are no Mussolini-style fascists in the Berlusconi 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's commitment to the EU, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the 
Helsinki accords on human rights will be cornerstones of his foreign policy, 
Berlusconi told the 315 elected and 11 life senators. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy), the Northern League of Umberto Bossi and 
the neo-fascist National Alliance of Gianfranco Fini are a few votes short of 
the 164 they will need Wednesday if all senators vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, sworn in last week after victory in March, expects to win enough 
supporting votes from centrist senators to win the mandatory confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Inaugurating the 53rd Italian government since World War II and the first in 
which the now-shattered Christian Democrats sit in the opposition, Berlusconi 
won a standing ovation with a pledge to continue the government's anti-Mafia 
crackdown, personified by two Sicilian magistrates who were murdered for their 
crusade against organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged Italians to overcome pessimism induced by the corruption scandals 
because "universal skepticism risks turning into a subtle and lethal poison." 
</P>
<P>
 On the economic front, Berlusconi told senators, his government will pursue an 
ongoing program to privatize telecommunications, electricity, energy and 
insurance giants now in government hands. It will jump-start a sluggish economy 
by encouraging investment, he said, promising new jobs and reform of what he 
called a "pathological" confusion of taxes.

MEXICAN CANDIDATE MEETS CHIAPAS REBELS; POLITICS: CARDENAS IS FIRST 
PRESIDENTIAL RIVAL TO VISIT LEADERS OF UPRISING. MOVE IS SEEN AS RISKY FOR HIS 
FLAGGING CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the opposition standard-bearer, has become the first 
Mexican presidential candidate to meet with leaders of the Chiapas Indian 
uprising on their own turf -- a decision that supporters acknowledged Monday 
was risky for his already flagging campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In this town at the edge of guerrilla-held territory, Cardenas stood on an 
open-air platform Sunday afternoon with the armed, masked leaders of the 
Zapatista National Liberation Army. In January, the guerrillas briefly took 
control of several towns near the Guatemalan border demanding national 
democracy, Indian rights and better living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (rights) for which you have fought are the same as those many of us have 
struggled for for years," Cardenas told about 1,200 Zapatistas and supporters. 
He emphasized that his struggle has been peaceful and that he believes there 
are legal, nonviolent ways to achieve democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas entered rebel-held territory near the end of a campaign tour of 
southern Mexico that has focused on government failures in the predominantly 
Indian region. 
</P>
<P>
 His trip followed his lackluster performance in last week's first-ever debate 
of Mexican presidential candidates; Cardenas, according to flash polls, was 
knocked out of a firm second place as voters considered their choices in the 
Aug. 21 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 After hours of waiting at a roadblock in this village, Zapatista supporters 
and a few guards in dark brown rebel uniforms received Cardenas and his aides 
with marimba music and such chants as "The people united will never be 
defeated!" 
</P>
<P>
 When Cardenas had been escorted to an improvised platform, a horn was blown 
and 500 uniformed rebel troops descended from the surrounding hillside and into 
formation within seconds. They conducted a precision drill with arms that 
ranged from AK-47s to cane poles; mostly, though, they carried a mix of hunting 
and World War II-vintage weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The troops then joined civilian supporters in singing revolutionary songs and, 
on command, disappeared again into the hills, except for a few dozen who formed 
a cordon around the area where Cardenas met privately with rebel leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The mere thought of Cardenas appearing with the armed rebels horrified many of 
his aides, who believe that their candidate has suffered from the ruling 
party's attempt to portray him as a violent radical whose election would bring 
chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cardenas -- in a brief interview at the rebel camp, where he joined the 
Zapatistas in dancing to traditional Mexican music with a rare, wide smile -- 
said he was willing to risk his image. "To govern this country, you have to 
talk with everyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After two hours of private meetings, first with the Clandestine Indigenous 
Revolutionary Committee and later, alone, with the enigmatic rebel spokesman, 
Subcommander Marcos, Cardenas addressed the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he listened uncomfortably to a tongue-lashing from Marcos, who accused 
Cardenas' Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) of choosing its candidates in 
undemocratic fashion and of adopting the government's free-market economic 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is the PRD different?" Marcos asked. He also warned: "We are not begging 
for democracy. We are demanding democracy. If there is not a (free and fair) 
election that leads to a transition to democracy, we will return to the 
alternative of arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas also met with military commanders in the region, the governor and 
human rights activists. He toured a crusading local newspaper and visited a 
6-month-old sit-in of Indians expelled from tribal lands in religious disputes. 
Aides said he tried to speak with ranchers, the most vocal opponents of the 
rebels, but that they refused to see him.

 Police detained prominent Chinese dissident Wang Dan today after he was 
interviewed by foreign journalists who came to his home, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five police officers showed Wang a detention warrant about 11 a.m. 
and took him away, a family member told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang had been detained twice in the week before Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's March visit to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang was imprisoned after the 1989 Tian An Men Square crackdown and paroled 3 
1/2 years later.

LAWYERS THREATEN TO TAKE RIGHTS DISPUTE TO CAIRO STREETS; EGYPT: THE DEATH IN 
CUSTODY OF AN ISLAMIC ATTORNEY AND DETENTIONS OF DOZENS MORE SPARK DEMAND FOR 
INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Abdel Harith Madani had made a name for himself as a young Islamic lawyer, 
defending clients accused of battling to overthrow the government of Egypt and 
successfully challenging a public school ban on young women wearing the black 
face veil of strict Islamic modesty. 
</P>
<P>
 He had also experienced more than his share of scrapes with police in his 
native village in southern Egypt, getting himself arrested a few years ago for 
trying to keep mourners out of graveyards, a practice viewed as pagan by 
Islamic fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on April 26, more than a dozen police officers stormed Madani's law 
offices, searched his files and led him, blindfolded, back to his tiny 
apartment in the dusty slums of Qunaissa near the foot of the Pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
 There they searched him again. Then they took the 32-year-old lawyer away. His 
wife heard nothing more until May 6, when the police phoned and told her to 
collect her husband's body. His coffin had been sealed. His grave has since 
been put under armed police guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Madani died of an asthma attack. His family and colleagues say 
he was tortured to death. The dispute threatens to unfold on the streets of 
Cairo today, when thousands of lawyers, who paralyzed the Egyptian courts in a 
nationwide strike Sunday, have threatened to rally to demand a full 
investigation and the release of 34 of their colleagues detained in Egypt's 
prisons without charge or trial. 
</P>
<P>
 While countries like China and Haiti are receiving the bulk of recent U.S. 
expressions of concern about human rights, Egypt -- America's key Arab partner 
in the Middle East peace process -- has quietly arrested 20,000 to 30,000 
political prisoners, activists here say. They say the Egyptians have executed 
more than 35 convicted extremists after widely criticized military trials since 
1992 and launched a law enforcement crackdown against Islamic terrorism. It has 
led to the deaths of dozens of suspects in blazing raids on their hide-outs. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every major human rights group in the world has criticized Egypt's 
widespread use in its prisons of torture and inhumane treatment, including dog 
attacks, rape, electric shock and reports of filthy water being injected into 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the fundamentalist-controlled Egyptian Lawyers Syndicate say their 
own interviews with doctors who examined Madani found signs that he had been 
subjected to electric shocks, hit on the head and hanged by the feet. 
</P>
<P>
 His case is by no means the first in which a professional has died in police 
custody. But because Madani was a lawyer for Islamic fundamentalists, the stage 
has been set for a confrontation between the government and one of Egypt's 
largest professional associations. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy also underscores the government's increasing suspicion of 
lawyers who represent Islamic extremist defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 It raises many issues similar to those that have long dogged American lawyers 
who represent those in organized crime: Are they merely defending suspects 
accused of extreme crimes? Or are they acting as the legal facade for 
organizations banned because of their determination to overthrow the government 
and install an Islamic state in Egypt? 
</P>
<P>
 A hint of what may be in store today -- if the planned protest here occurs -- 
arose Sunday, when truckloads of riot police surrounded the lawyers syndicate 
headquarters and prepared at one point to lob tear gas into the courtyard as 
angry demonstrators shouted: "What a shame! The Interior Ministry is run by a 
donkey!" 
</P>
<P>
 Under Egypt's controversial 13-year-old state of emergency -- in place since 
the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat by Islamic extremists -- 
virtually all public demonstrations are illegal. Protests are quickly, often 
violently, curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not negotiation. This is not bargaining. We will go out into the 
streets unless the state complies with our request. We will face security, even 
if it meets us with bullets," declared Mokhtar Noah, a prominent Islamic lawyer 
who is leading the campaign for an investigation into Madani's death. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Ministry, the agency responsible for internal security in Egypt 
and overseer of its police forces, has said Madani developed breathing 
difficulties and fainted during a search of his second home. He was taken to 
the prison ward of a hospital in downtown Cairo, where he died of respiratory 
failure linked to asthma. He "died of an asthma attack, and it has nothing to 
do with torture," Interior Minister Hassan Alfi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government says Madani was acting as a conduit between imprisoned members 
of the Gamaa al Islamiya, the outlawed Islamic Group, and their terrorist 
agents outside. It said Madani is believed to have received more than $15,000 
from the alleged leader of the Gamaa's military wing, Talaat Yassin Hammam. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammam, sentenced to death in absentia in a case involving several former 
fighters in the Afghanistan civil war, was killed along with six colleagues 
during a dawn raid on his hide-out at dawn on the day before Madani's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kamel Khaled, a lawyer and member of Parliament, said Madani had recently 
been trying to negotiate a truce between Gamaa al Islamiya and the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Khaled said Madani's message was that the group had realized it was being 
manipulated by countries outside Egypt and was ready to call a truce.

U.N. VOTES TO DISPATCH PEACEKEEPING FORCE TO RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Security Council voted early today to send more than five thousand 
peacekeepers to Rwanda to try to stem "a humanitarian crisis of enormous 
proportions." 
</P>
<P>
 The all-African force protects civilians and relief workers in areas where aid 
is being provided to the thousands suffering and displaced after a month of 
slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the peacekeepers will not be allowed to use force to stop the fighting or 
to prevent massacres in areas outside their control, and it could take months 
for member states to contribute the troops and proper military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. delegation had doubts about the operation and reluctantly supported a 
resolution launching it only under pressure from other Security Council members 
anxious to try to prevent further bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in a month of 
ethnic slaughter between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis, the United 
Nations and aid groups say. Nearly 2 million people have fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights organizations and aid workers blame militias led by extremist 
Hutu politicians for most of the slaughter, much of it done with machetes, 
spears and knives after the president, a Hutu, died in a mysterious plane 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing the dispute into the council chambers, the Tutsi-dominated rebel 
Rwandan Patriotic Front announced it would not comply with the resolution if 
Foreign Minister Jerome Bicamumpaka sat in Rwanda's Security Council seat. 
Bicamumpaka spoke to the council, blaming Tutsis for the violence, and remained 
in his seat for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicamumpaka said an arms embargo should be slapped on neighboring Uganda, 
which he accused of supplying the rebels.

U.S. SAYS IT SEES SIGNS HAITI'S MILITARY LEADERS MAY STEP DOWN UNDER PRESSURE; 
CARIBBEAN: OFFICIALS CAUTION NO DEAL IS PENDING. MEANWHILE, PROVISIONAL 
PRESIDENT NAMES CABINET WITH NO PRIME MINISTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration said Monday that it has received preliminary 
indications that Haiti's military rulers may be willing to step down in the 
face of increased U.S. pressure, but officials cautioned that no firm deal is 
yet in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure was made by Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who told 
reporters traveling with him to Ottawa that Washington is "starting to get some 
signals" that Haitian military chief Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras realizes that his 
position is precarious and "might want to step down." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Perry did not elaborate, other U.S. officials cited a spate of recent 
developments, from signs of growing friction in the Haitian military to 
indications that the new military-backed government has been having difficulty 
putting together a Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration strategists, clearly taken aback by Perry's remarks, 
cautioned that any such signals are preliminary and "should by no means be seen 
as any evidence" that either Cedras or other military leaders are about to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it will require additional pressure before anything like that might 
occur," one key official suggested Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as Haiti's new military-backed provisional president, 
Emile Jonassaint, named a new Cabinet on Monday, leaving the post of prime 
minister unfilled. Acting Prime Minister Robert Malval, who had headed Haiti's 
legally elected government, denounced the regime Monday as illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 In an act of defiance that broke a six-month silence, Malval called on civil 
servants to disobey the new government's orders and demanded that Cedras resign 
immediately, charging that he had disgraced his uniform and locked Haiti into 
"the darkness of night." 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come for you to leave so that a new dawn may break for the 
Haitian people," Malval told Cedras publicly. "Morally, you are not worthy of 
the title of commander in chief of the armed forces of Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers immediately issued a statement 
praising Malval as "courageous," saying the United States vigorously supports 
the acting prime minister's denunciation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malval and his Cabinet are the only legitimate constitutional government in 
Haiti, operating under the authority of President (Jean-Bertrand) Aristide," 
the statement said. "Obviously, neither we nor the international community will 
have any dealings with the Jonassaint Cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been intensifying its economic pressure against Haiti, 
pushing to tighten U.N.-imposed sanctions and threatening to use "the military 
option" if Cedras and other military leaders do not resign. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton also has appointed William H. Gray III, a former congressman 
from Pennsylvania, as special envoy to Haiti in hopes of working out a 
diplomatic settlement. Planning for possible military action has been suspended 
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as, separately, the Pentagon announced that the United 
States has contracted with a Ukrainian firm, the Black Sea Shipping Co., to 
provide the merchant vessel Ivan Franco for use as an immigrant-processing 
ship, at least for the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new policy announced by Clinton earlier this month, the Administration 
will step up processing of Haitian applications for immigration to the United 
States by reviewing them aboard ships at sea. The shift was designed to meet 
protests by the Congressional Black Caucus, which complained that the policy of 
intercepting Haitians at sea and returning them to the island without a hearing 
was endangering lives of those sent home. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters Monday that, while 
officials are "working on" putting that policy into effect, U.S. warships had 
intercepted 586 Haitians since last Thursday. "They are a reminder that those 
who attempt to leave Haiti illegally and not take advantage of the process that 
exists now . . . will be met with the same firm implementation of the policy of 
direct return that remains U.S. policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Ukrainian ship is intended as an interim step while the 
Administration looks for a third country -- possibly Barbados -- that might 
agree to provide processing facilities for would-be immigrants from Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks to reporters Monday, Perry said, "We're starting to get some 
signals from Haiti, but it's very difficult to interpret just what these 
signals mean." He said some of them had suggested "that Cedras might be willing 
to step down."

ARGENTINA LINKS EX-NAZI CASE, THATCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Argentina said Monday that former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
should be extradited for the 1982 sinking of one of its warships in the same 
way a former Nazi SS officer is being extradited from Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the extradition of former SS officer Erich Priebke is being requested on 
the grounds that the Jewish Holocaust was a war crime, so was the sinking of 
the cruiser General Belgrano, and in that case Argentina should request the 
extradition of former British Prime Minister Thatcher," the independent NA news 
agency quoted President Carlos Saul Menem as telling a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The sinking of the Argentine cruiser during the 10-week Falklands War claimed 
323 lives among its crew of 1,093. About 6 million Jews were killed by the 
Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem was speaking in the mountain resort of Bariloche, 1,000 miles south of 
Buenos Aires, where police last week arrested Priebke after he admitted taking 
part in the Ardeatine Caves massacre in Italy during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Priebke, 81, who like many Nazis found a haven in Argentina after the war, had 
been living for decades in Bariloche, a town with a large German community. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina is still awaiting the official extradition request from Italy for 
Priebke for his part in Italy's worst World War II atrocity. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina and Britain have resumed full diplomatic relations since the 1982 
war. Menem, his country's second elected president since the return to 
democracy in 1983, had recently been seeking an official invitation for a state 
visit to Britain.

DOMINICANS VOTE; SIGNS OF FRAUD EMERGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Signs of fraud emerged in elections Monday to determine if President Joaquin 
Balaguer, a key player in torpedoing world sanctions on neighboring Haiti, will 
extend his long rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading challenger Jose Francisco Pena Gomez and other opponents accused 
electoral officials of excluding some voters from the polls -- a charge 
confirmed in part by international election monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Balaguer's 1990 victory, in which he received fewer than 700,000 votes in a 
nation of 7.6 million, was marred by widespread allegations of electoral fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The blind, 87-year-old leader, who has ruled for 20 of the last 28 years, 
dismissed the charges of fraud in Monday's voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls put him in a dead heat with Pena Gomez, a 57-year-old lawyer and former 
mayor of Santo Domingo. The challenger hopes to become the first black 
president this century in a nation where 84% of the people are black or of 
mixed race. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were being closely scrutinized in Washington and next door in 
Haiti, where military coup leaders have been able to withstand international 
sanctions because Balaguer has allowed profitable cross-border smuggling.

MILITARY CHIEFS OPEN DRIVE TO FORCE ARMED SERVICES TO COOPERATE MORE; PENTAGON: 
INCREASED POOLING OF WEAPONS AND OTHER RESOURCES IS THE GOAL. FIERCE TURF 
BATTLES AMONG ARMY, NAVY AND AIR FORCE ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's top military leadership has begun a major new push to force the 
individual armed services to pool their equipment and resources more 
thoroughly, setting the stage for what could become one of the Pentagon's 
fiercest turf battles in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the effort, spearheaded by Adm. William A. Owens, vice 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, could have important implications for 
the Pentagon budget, the structure and weapons of each of the services and even 
the way the military fights future wars. 
</P>
<P>
 The project already has spawned strong objections from the individual 
services. Insiders said that the Air Force, Army and Navy are strongly opposed 
to the effort, on grounds that it would deprive them of their traditional power 
to decide such issues on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior military officers said that Owens, who assumed the vice chairman's job 
in March after having earned a reputation as one of the Navy's most 
reform-minded long-range planners, is likely to face an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you get into this, you get into each service's crown jewels," a 
senior military officer involved in the effort declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, officials said, the project has the backing of Gen. John M. 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who is convinced that the services 
must go further than they have so far to combine their resources in the face of 
declining defense budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The new effort would force the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines to take 
account of what other branches of the armed forces can do in carrying out 
various missions, from intelligence gathering to gaining air superiority during 
the early phases of a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 It also would require for the first time that the services plan their budgets 
cooperatively, ceding turf or eliminating weapons where top military leaders 
decide that another service can do a job better. Today, each service plans its 
own budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens already has gotten the project under way using a little-known committee 
known as the Joint Requirements and Oversight Council -- a high-level panel 
comprising the vice chiefs of staff of each of the individual services, all of 
them four-star generals or admirals. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has begun a series of reviews aimed at identifying weaknesses, 
duplication and overlap in the various services' modernization and procurement 
programs, with the aim of eliminating redundancies and filling vacuums. 
</P>
<P>
 In considering those issues, however, the group also is expected to thrash out 
potential changes in the roles and missions of each of the services and 
potential changes in military doctrine that may be necessary to carry out any 
reshuffling that it proposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the questions that the panel is pondering, for example, is whether the 
Air Force should take over Army programs for high-altitude air-defense and 
whether the Army's multiple-launch rocket system should be adapted for use by 
Navy warships. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also is expected to recommend adapting current precision-guided 
weapons, sensor systems and computer software so all four services can take 
advantage of common high-technology systems, such as satellite links and 
target-acquisition devices. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, could require the services to give up some of the pet weapons 
projects that they now have on the books which were launched a decade or so ago 
when the services operated more as individual forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that Owens hopes to have an initial set of proposals this 
autumn, in time for the fiscal 1996 budget. But critics cautioned that the 
effort is so radical it is unlikely to yield many major changes for at least a 
year or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. Gaskin, a former Pentagon strategist now with Business Executives 
for National Security, a defense-monitoring group, said that Owens' effort is 
long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Owens project, outlined in a document labeled "Assessing Joint Warfighting 
Capabilities," seeks to review military requirements for today's post-Cold War 
missions, evaluate the readiness of existing forces and decide what new weapons 
systems will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 It calls for high-level reviews in 10 separate areas, including intelligence, 
surveillance, command-and-control, strike capability, air superiority, 
strategic mobility, overseas presence, joint readiness, information warfare and 
counterproliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 To some outside observers, the effort appears to be intended partly to enable 
the military to preempt -- if not usurp -- a separate, civilian-run Commission 
on Roles and Missions set up by former Defense Secretary Les Aspin. 
</P>
<P>
 It also would provide the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- and the vice chiefs of the 
individual services -- with substantially more power than it has assumed in 
recent years. Until this year, for example, the Joint Requirements and 
Oversight Council was a low-profile advisory board that mainly rubber-stamped 
the services' proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The military has begun moving toward more and more joint operations in recent 
years, under which units from all four services are assigned to a single 
commander, who is empowered to order them into combat without going through 
each services' chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But the services still act independently in planning their weapons purchases, 
budgets and individual doctrine.

HALDEMAN DIARY SAYS NIXON RAILED AGAINST BLACKS, JEWS IN MEDIA; PRESIDENCY: 
BOOK BY LATE CHIEF OF STAFF IS PREVIEWED ON 'NIGHTLINE.' ANOTHER EX-AIDE SAYS 
REMARKS SHOW FRUSTRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 H.R. Haldeman, as Richard Nixon's right-hand man, recorded in his diary that 
the President was "pretty fed up with blacks," and believed there was "total 
Jewish domination of the media." 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 26, 1970, Haldeman dictated that Nixon "really raged again against 
United States Jews" and told his aide "not to let any Jews see him about the 
Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
 Haldeman noted that the Nixon outburst was in the presence of his national 
security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, who is Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haldeman recollections, to be published in a book Tuesday, were previewed 
Monday night on ABC's "Nightline," with a second segment to be broadcast on 
Tuesday. In some cases, Haldeman's voice is heard as he dictated, in others his 
words are read by anchor Ted Koppel. 
</P>
<P>
 Koppel describes Haldeman, Nixon's chief of staff, as "what so many of us have 
always wished for, a fly on the wall with a notebook, a tape recorder, a 
home-movie camera; and access to almost everything that happened during the 
Nixon years in the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon died last month; Haldeman last year. The television program shows Jo 
Haldeman saying that in his final illness her husband said "he wanted me to 
keep his commitment to have the diaries published." 
</P>
<P>
 Haldeman's recollections range from the trivial -- how his staff thought that 
getting Nixon a dog would humanize him -- to bigotry at the presidential level. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for comment, John H. Taylor, director of the Nixon Library & Birthplace 
in Yorba Linda, said "politics and anti-Semitism are two different things" and 
that black-Jewish statements Nixon made "should be viewed strictly in a 
political context." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor contends the statements reflect Nixon's frustrations. He attracted only 
a small part of the Jewish vote in the 1968 election and polls showed most Jews 
did not support his Vietnam policies, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the privilege of serving him for 15 years and never heard him make an 
anti-Semitic statement," said Taylor, Nixon's former aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon did not have much support among black Americans, although he went 
through the motions such as posing for pictures with band leader Lionel Hampton 
and singer-dancer Sammy Davis Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Koppel reads Haldeman's words: 
</P>
<P>
 "P (President) emphasized that you have to face the fact that the whole 
problem is really the blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognizes 
this while not appearing to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pointed out that there has never in history been an adequate black nation and 
they are the only race of which this is true. Says Africa is hopeless, the 
worst there is Liberia, which we built." 
</P>
<P>
 After Nixon met with black civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy on May 13, 
1969, Haldeman said Abernathy had brought a long list of demands then "went out 
and stabbed us on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Haldeman: "Proved again there's no use dealing honestly with these 
people. They obviously want confrontation, no solutions . . . pretty fed up 
with blacks and their hopeless attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose comments on the television program that Nixon 
was particularly unhappy about the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is funny about Nixon: He rants and raves about the Jews, and they control 
the press and they this and they that. He was the best friend Israel ever had. 
And he had Bill Safire working for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Safire, who is Jewish, was a Nixon speech writer. He now is a columnist for 
the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was considerable discussion of the terrible problem arising from the 
total Jewish domination of the media and agreement that this is something that 
would have to be dealt with," Haldeman is heard saying. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rev. (Billy) Graham has the strong feeling that the Bible says that there 
are satanic Jews and that's where our problem arises."

U.S. JUDGE RULES PART OF BRADY LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brady law's requirement that local law enforcement officials run 
background checks on anyone wanting to buy a firearm is unconstitutional, a 
federal judge ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge Charles C. Lovell left in place the law's five-day 
waiting period to purchase a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 During the waiting period, local law enforcers are supposed to check to be 
sure a gun buyer is an adult and doesn't have a felony record or a drug, 
alcohol or mental problem that would bar a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovell said the law's order for local law officers to perform the check 
commandeers state officials to administer a federal program. That violates the 
constitutional limits on the federal government's power over the states, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling is believed to be the first decision handed down in several 
lawsuits filed nationally as part of a National Rifle Assn. effort to overturn 
the law, which Congress passed Nov. 30. It took effect Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Elison, professor at the University of Montana, said the ruling does not 
necessarily apply outside Montana. Federal courts in other states could reach 
different conclusions, leading to a U.S. Supreme Court case, he said.

FIRM CLEARED IN 7 MARINES' DEATH IN WAR; SETTLEMENT: THE O.C. WIDOW OF ONE OF 
THOSE KILLED IS ANGRY THAT THE AEROSPACE COMPANY WAS FOUND NOT RESPONSIBLE.

 An aerospace company has been cleared of causing the deaths of a U.S. Marine 
from San Juan Capistrano and six others in a friendly fire incident during the 
Persian Gulf War, but has admitted falsifying test results for defective 
missile launcher parts, according to a plea bargain filed Monday in federal 
district court. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Camp Pendleton Marines, including 23-year-old Cpl. Stephen E. Bentzlin, 
died in January, 1991, in the first land battle of Desert Storm when their 
lightly armored vehicle was hit by a missile fired from an Air Force A-10. The 
deadly incident came as Bentzlin's unit was involved in the battle for Khafji, 
a northern Saudi Arabian border town seized by Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
 In the settlement, the company, Lucas Aul, of Garden City, N.Y., a subsidiary 
of the multibillion-dollar British-owned defense contractor Lucas Industries, 
was cleared of those deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company pleaded guilty to a felony charge of deliberately submitting 
the falsified results and agreed to pay the government $4 million in fines, 
$7.5 million in restitution for the faulty parts and $500,000 in reimbursement 
for the federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In its plea, Lucas acknowledged that employees had falsified test results 
indicating that the parts -- launch electronic units -- had passed vibration, 
severe weather and current-flow tests, according to the office of Zachary 
Carter, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. The units, which 
help pilots fire missiles, were manufactured under a $54-million, classified 
government contract. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, government inspections of the 4,390 units manufactured by Lucas 
showed some had "incomplete and defective soldering, broken resistors and the 
presence of foreign objects" contaminating surfaces, according to the plea 
agreement filed by Justice Department attorney Michael Cornacchia and Defense 
Department attorney Jane Blumenthal-Stechman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation," however, "revealed that the launcher electronic units 
that Lucas manufactured . . . were not responsible for the deaths or injuries 
to any members of the United States armed services," said the plea, which was 
based on a two-year investigation by the Defense Department's Office of 
Inspector General and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentzlin's widow was not pleased with the news Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government would find that, because if they didn't, somebody would be 
responsible," Carol Bentzlin said from her home in San Juan Capistrano. 
"Nobody's ever held responsible for friendly fire. The fact remains that they 
sent shoddy equipment over there, and now the government is going to get money 
for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentzlin said she was not surprised by the agreement, which she said sends a 
message that the lives lost on the battlefield, including her husband's, are 
"totally expendable." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's reprehensible that happened because no one is held accountable," she 
said.

ENGINEER KILLED AS TRAINS COLLIDE; TRANSIT: 350 HURT WHEN AMTRAK'S SILVER 
METEOR DERAILS IN NORTH CAROLINA AFTER ITS LOCOMOTIVE HITS A TRACTOR-TRAILER 
JUTTING OUT FROM A PASSING FREIGHT CAR.

<P>
 An Amtrak train derailed when it struck a truck-trailer that had shifted on a 
passing freight train early Monday morning, killing the engineer and injuring 
more than 350 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt a tremendous bump," said Dick Hutchinson of Wilton, Conn."I started 
to slide out of my seat under the seat in front of me. Then we felt two more 
thuds." 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchinson was among many of the 438 people aboard who suffered minor 
injuries; he skinned his knees. About 75 people were treated at Johnston 
Memorial Hospital and seven were taken to Duke University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed was assistant engineer Brooks Woodward, 41, of Laurinburg, Amtrak 
President Thomas M. Downs said. Engineer William Black of Leland was in serious 
condition with broken legs and a concussion, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Meteor derailed about 1:45 a.m. PDT, about 25 miles southeast of 
Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Downs said in Washington that the truck-trailer on a northbound CSX freight 
train was put on the collision course with the passenger train after its load 
of cat-box filler shifted, causing the tractor-trailer to jut out over the side 
of its flatbed car. 
</P>
<P>
 Downs said the Amtrak train was traveling about 70 m.p.h. and the CSX train 
about 35 m.p.h. when the Amtrak lead locomotive hit the trailer and derailed. 
All but one of the Amtrak's 19 cars derailed, but only one of the freight 
train's 52 cars left the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 300 people were taken to a Red Cross shelter at the National Guard 
Armory, where telephones, medical care and travel help were provided. Some 
passengers were put on buses to their destinations and others were put in 
hotels to await new trains.

BROAD ANTI-SMOKING MEASURE HEADED FOR SENATE SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legislation to ban smoking statewide in virtually all indoor workplaces, 
including restaurants, cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee on Monday 
and is headed for a showdown on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) had stalled last month 
when senators on another committee imposed amendments that could have allowed 
smoking in restaurants, and barred cities from passing tougher smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who had pushed for the amendments over Friedman's objections was 
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). He was criticized by health groups and others. 
On Monday, Torres, a candidate for Insurance Commissioner, reversed himself and 
championed removal of the amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was approved on an 8-3 vote. If the measure clears the Senate, it 
must return to the Assembly for approval by the lower house.

ARRAY OF 250 SOUTHLAND SEISMIC MONITORING SITES URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earthquake experts Monday proposed establishment of a dense array of 250 
Global Positioning System stations in urban areas of Southern California to 
allow more precise determinations of seismic strains accumulating in the region 
and improve long-range earthquake forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Southern California Earthquake Center at USC, the U.S. 
Geological Survey and Jet Propulsion Laboratory declared that the proposed 
seven-year, $20-million project would probably require a special congressional 
authorization. The scientists were meeting at JPL. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, it was disclosed that the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration and the Geological Survey had agreed to make grants totaling 
$400,000 to double the system of stations from the present 15 by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The stations use satellite signals to measure tiny creeping movements within 
the earth, showing the distribution of annual seismic slip. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tom Henyey, executive director of the Earthquake Center, said a larger, 
more dense network -- extending from Santa Barbara east to Palm Springs and 
from Palmdale south to Orange County -- would allow a fault-by-fault 
measurement of strain that would show in more detail which areas of the 
Southland are most prone to large earthquakes in the decades ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Henyey and JPL's Andrea Donnellan said, building codes could be 
strengthened in some particularly vulnerable areas, and insurance rates could 
be adjusted in accord with the quake prospects, with premiums being set higher 
in those areas and lower in others. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnellan said scientists promoting the project have discussed means of 
funding with the staffs from the offices of Rep. George Brown (D-Colton) and 
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
 Henyey said a number of federal agencies have expressed interest but have also 
said that it would be difficult to divert money from other projects to fund the 
network without congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before Monday's meeting, a Northridge aftershock of magnitude 3.7, 
centered five miles north of Chatsworth, awakened people from the San Fernando 
Valley to Santa Monica, and a few elsewhere, at 1:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Today marks four months since the magnitude 6.8 earthquake, and there have 
been more than 8,000 aftershocks since then, most of them too small to feel, 
but several over magnitude 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucile M. Jones, a seismologist with the Geological Survey, said Monday that 
there are still about two aftershocks a week that exceed magnitude 3.0, and an 
average of 1 1/2 every two weeks exceeding magnitude 3.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the odds are that there will be about one magnitude 4 aftershock a 
month in the months ahead. There is a 56% probability of a magnitude 5 sometime 
in the next year. The last aftershock greater than 5, a magnitude 5.3 temblor, 
occurred March 20.

IMMINENT DANGER DEFENSE, USED IN MENENDEZ CASE, IS UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court, ruling on the type of defense employed by the 
Menendez brothers, held Monday that defendants can escape murder convictions if 
they kill out of an honest but mistaken conviction that their lives are in 
imminent danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's 5-2 decision on a case out of Orange County allows murder 
defendants to be convicted on lesser charges if they feared imminent harm from 
their victims. The doctrine upheld by the court, known as the "imperfect 
self-defense," is widely employed, particularly by battered wives. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle and Erik Menendez, who are facing new trials for the murders of their 
parents, argued that they feared for their lives after years of physical and 
emotional abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear of future harm -- no matter how great the fear and no matter how great 
the likelihood of the harm -- will not suffice," wrote Justice Marvin Baxter 
for the majority. "The defendant's fear must be of imminent danger to life or 
great bodily injury." 
</P>
<P>
 Without that defense, judges would be required to instruct juries to convict 
defendants of murder unless the killing occurred in clear self-defense or in 
the heat of passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Abramson, attorney for Erik Menendez, said the decision reinforces her 
client's right to assert that defense in his retrial. She said he and his 
brother had an "understandable" and imminent fear for their lives after they 
had threatened to make public their father's alleged sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyer praised the court's ruling for making clear that such 
defenses have been used for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to think that this was some sort of designer defense that was 
recently made up," she said. "It clearly was not. . . . (The court) recognized 
that non-criminals kill." 
</P>
<P>
 A state legislator has introduced a bill that would write into law the 
acceptability of the defense. The bill would codify a 1979 California Supreme 
Court decision that an honest, albeit unreasonable, fear of imminent danger 
negates the mental state of malice aforethought necessary for a murder 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had contended that such defenses were barred under a 1981 state 
statute and the 1982 Victims Bill of Rights initiative. Chief Justice Malcolm 
Lucas, joined by Court of Appeal Justice Robert K. Puglia in a dissent, agreed 
with prosecutors that the Legislature abrogated the defense in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "No court, not even a supreme one, may create new defenses or revive abrogated 
ones simply as a matter of policy or preference," Lucas wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange County case before the court, a 16-year-old Dana Point boy shot 
and killed a reputed gang member who chased him on the beach after threatening 
and harassing him for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge convicted the boy of second-degree murder, but a Court of Appeal in 
Santa Ana reduced the conviction to manslaughter. The court held that the 
defendant, Christian S., had an "honest but unreasonable fear of immediate 
harm" when he shot reputed skinhead Robert Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Garrett Beaumont, who had argued that such defenses are 
barred, said he was disappointed with the decision. He noted, however, that the 
court did not seem to favor an expansion of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to make sure it is not expanded to allow somebody to use the 
doctrine if they are not in fear of imminent danger to their life or great 
bodily injury," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Christian S. could not be reached for comment.

GETTING MULTIMEDIA UP AND RUNNING; TECHNOLOGY: A SMALL HUNTINGTON BEACH FIRM 
HAS LAUNCHED A SOFTWARE PROGRAM THAT ANALYZES WHAT'S WRONG WITH A SYSTEM AND 
OFFERS REMEDIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Norm Jacobson has met the dark side of multimedia, the gear that allows 
personal computers to play movie-like videos, animation and compact-disk 
quality sound. 
</P>
<P>
 It took him three hours to install a component to make his PC do those 
whiz-bang things. And Jacobson is a pro. He teaches computer classes at UC 
Irvine and has more than 10 years of experience getting the various parts of 
computers to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson is one of many frustrated consumers drawn to multimedia by slick 
advertising only to encounter misery when things don't work right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is touting how great multimedia is," Jacobson said. "But getting it 
to work can be a real problem. The average person out there needs some help." 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes that a new product from TouchStone Software Corp. will help. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the small Huntington Beach company started selling Setup Advisor, 
a computer program that analyzes what's wrong with a multimedia system, as well 
as other computer woes, and gives advice on how to fix it. Setup Advisor, for 
instance, shows whether a particular PC is compatible with certain multimedia 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 TouchStone figures its new product will help thousands of everyday computer 
users who try to save money by following highly touted "easy to install" 
instructions and wind up instead with multimedia systems that don't work 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers are buying the $29.95 program, and TouchStone hopes to sell up to 
20,000 copies a month. But the program isn't so popular with multimedia kit 
manufacturers, who say their sets of hardware and software aren't hard to 
install. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies TouchStone's struggle. The feisty 30-employee firm finds its 
markets in the educational gaps that big companies leave between themselves and 
their hapless customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to create trouble for the manufacturers, but when you create 
diagnostic software, you're looking to find problems in products and to solve 
them," said C. Shannon Jenkins, TouchStone's chief executive. "We're helping 
the people on the front lines -- the customers and the stores." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ayear ago, tiny TouchStone found itself in a similar battle. It launched a 
program to help befuddled consumers, but it caught flak from officials at 
software giant Microsoft Corp., maker of MS-DOS 6.0, the basic operating 
software that makes PCs run. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins, along with other software industry followers, said Microsoft's 
product was seriously flawed. Microsoft officials said that TouchStone's 
criticism amounted to a ploy to market TouchStone's utility software. But the 
software giant subsequently revised the program to address user complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapping into new frustration, TouchStone says it expects robust sales of Setup 
Advisor. The Fry's Electronics store in Fountain Valley sold 45 copies of Setup 
Advisor in its first weekend on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins believes the market for TouchStone's software could be big because of 
the twin tides of frustration and fascination with multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, worldwide sales of CD-ROM drives -- an essential component in 
multimedia -- soared 155% over the previous year as millions of consumers 
bought the devices to play the video and sound stored on computer compact 
disks, according to InfoTech, a market research firm in Woodstock, Vt. 
Multimedia kits typically include the CD-ROM drives, sound cards and speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But as sales of multimedia kits grow, consumers are discovering that it's hard 
to take apart a computer with a screwdriver, install the equipment, and then 
load the software that makes it work. Installation gets more difficult as more 
components are added, said John Hulina, a multimedia product buyer for computer 
distributor Ingram Micro Inc. in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Setup Advisor is aimed at easing the frustration and giving the consumer more 
time to enjoy the fascination. The program also should help boost the company's 
earnings. TouchStone said Monday that it earned $74,500, or 1 cent a share, for 
the first quarter, slightly below the $75,000 earned in last year's first 
quarter. Quarterly revenue grew 8% to $1.3 million from $1.2 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Setup Advisor's selling points, TouchStone's first step in marketing 
the program has been to draw attention to the volume of returned multimedia 
merchandise as evidence that people are abandoning multimedia in frustration. 
The tactic has sparked criticism from multimedia manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the degree that TouchStone doesn't distinguish between good multimedia 
kits and bad ones and lumps us all together, I'm not thrilled about that," said 
Greg Reznick, vice president of marketing at MediaVision Technology Inc. in 
Fremont, one of the largest makers of multimedia kits. 
</P>
<P>
 "PCs are complicated. But there are companies that do a good job of explaining 
how to use them or expand them," he said. "We think we do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reznick said his company's kits come with programs that can detect and solve 
problems as well as TouchStone's program can. But Jenkins points out that 
consumers must buy the $300 to $400 kit from MediaVision to use the software 
that detects potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry's other multimedia powerhouse, Creative Labs Inc. in Milpitas, 
also bristles at the notion that multimedia kits are so difficult to install 
that they're being returned in droves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a common misconception in the industry about the rate of return of 
our products," said Richard Buchanan, a product marketing director for Creative 
Labs. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan said Creative Labs welcomes any programs such as TouchStone's that 
can help simplify the complicated installation process. But he disagreed that 
return rates are skyrocketing. Buchanan said that of the 60,000 sound cards 
that Creative Labs ships every month, less than 1% are returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just opening the computer is intimidating, sort of like changing the oil in 
your car," Buchanan said. "It's not easy to install things. But from our 
perspective, the difficulty is dramatically overblown." 
</P>
<P>
 But Norm Jacobson, the UCI computer teacher who spent three hours installing 
his multimedia kit, thinks TouchStone's new software is useful for heading off 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the vendors say there is no problem, that's a bunch of hooey," he said. 
"Third-party dealers who sell the computers don't do installations well. If you 
call the manufacturer to get help, you have a hard time getting through or you 
hear some jargon you don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Bradford, an Anaheim retiree, said he spent several days over the course of 
a month trying to install his $200 CD-ROM drive. Whatever he tried, including 
calls to the manufacturer, didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he got help from friends at the North Orange County Computer Club. 
Now Bradford gets a big kick out of a music composition CD-ROM program in which 
he enters musical notes and his computer plays them back as if it were a piano. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that the majority of people just want to find some computer-literate 
person and have them install their equipment for them," said Dain Leese, a 
Costa Mesa software consultant who volunteers for the North Orange County 
Computer Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Such complaints may be why consumers are buying utility software. 
</P>
<P>
 Without much competition from other software companies for Setup Advisor, 
TouchStone is plowing forward. Setup Advisor is a mini-program that was 
included last year in its $60 full-scale utility program, CheckIt PRO Analyst. 
The company will market similar mini-programs, such as one to help so-called 
road warriors who use portable computers. 
</P>
<P>
 But some say that TouchStone's opportunity won't last long since more and more 
people are just buying computers with pre-installed multimedia components. 
Manufacturers also are revising their kit installation software so it is easier 
to use. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather spend my time playing with interactive software than a 
screwdriver,"said David Bunnell, editor in chief of New Media magazine, a 
multimedia industry journal in San Mateo. "Installing a kit is a universal 
problem, but a short-term one" because technology will eventually make the 
problem disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1995, the majority of CD-ROM sales will be through purchases of new 
computers that come with multimedia gear pre-installed on the machine, not from 
upgrade kits, Buchanan said.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Microsoft and other industry leaders are trying to adopt 
equipment standards, dubbed Plug and Play, that would allow consumers to 
install any add-on device on any PC, regardless of the manufacturer of the PC 
or maker of the device. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard technology will be built into Microsoft's upcoming Windows 4.0 
software, due out at the end of this year. But for now, Jenkins said, computer 
users will have to get help from something like Setup Advisor or a friendly 
neighborhood computer whiz.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the meantime, we can do a lot of useful work," she said.

IRVINE-BASED SOFTWARE FIRM TO CUT 300 JOBS; RESTRUCTURING: PLATINUM CORP. IS 
ALSO SEEKING TO SELL SEVERAL PRODUCT LINES AS PART OF $15-MILLION EFFORT.

 Platinum Software Corp., whose top management was ousted last month amid 
allegations of accounting fraud, said Monday that it will shed as many as 300 
employees, or more than a third of its work force, as part of a $15-million 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubled accounting software company, based in Irvine, also reduced its 
previously reported revenue for the past 15 months by $18.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum acknowledged last month that it had been reporting potential sales as 
actual revenue. Co-founder Gerald R. Blackie and three other executives 
resigned April 18 when the company revealed the accounting irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmelo J. Santoro, a Platinum board member who replaced Blackie as chief 
executive, said Monday that the company had to cut its costs to ensure that its 
operating expenses are in line with its expectations of lower revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 300 affected workers, or 37% of the company's 820 employees, about 100 
will be laid off immediately, including as many as 35 at the company's Irvine 
headquarters, Santoro said. Another 200 employees will either be laid off later 
or will stay with operations that Platinum hopes to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is negotiating to sell several of its software lines by the end of 
the current quarter, Santoro said, so it can focus on its core accounting 
products. It hopes to sell its international sales organizations for Europe 
(except Britain), Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock, which lost 64% of its market value when the management 
shake-up was announced, has recovered somewhat since Santoro took over the 
company. In Monday's Nasdaq trading, Platinum shares rose 25 cents to close at 
$5.875.  
</P>
<P>
 Charles Phillips, analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York, called the 
restructuring a necessary step for Platinum, but the company's survival remains 
in question. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a precarious situation," he said. "They still have $17 million in 
cash, and that is enough to go forward. They are doing the things they need to 
do in order to keep going, like reassuring customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by a shareholder lawsuit, Platinum earlier this year began reviewing 
its accounting procedures. The company said Monday that it studied more than 
240 software contracts and several acquisitions during its review. That 
resulted in the $18.2-million adjustment to earlier revenue figures. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75% of those sales, however, or about $13.6 million in revenue, will 
likely be booked in subsequent quarters, said Bruce Edwards, a Platinum board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's disclosure of the accounting irregularities triggered a probe by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. That investigation is continuing, 
Santoro said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 For its third fiscal quarter, which ended March 31, the company reported a 
loss of $13 million. That compared to a restated loss of $1.2 million for the 
same period a year earlier. Three-month revenue was $14.2 million, compared to 
restated revenue of $6.8 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's fourth fiscal quarter, which ends June 30, will include a charge 
of $15 million to cover costs of the restructuring. That total does not include 
any potential liability for shareholder lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months ended March 31, Platinum reported a loss of $25.6 million. 
That compared to a loss of $885,000 for the same period a year earlier. Revenue 
was $40.2 million, compared to restated revenue of $19.1 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue revisions and restructuring charge were bigger than the company 
originally expected to report in April, said Helen Hodges, a San Diego lawyer 
who is representing shareholders suing Platinum. Platinum Software Corp.

 For its third fiscal quarter ended March 31, Platinum Software reported 
revenue of $14.2 million, compared to restated revenue of $6.8 million for the

AUTO-LEASING SCAM KINGPIN GETS 3 YEARS; COURTS: MISSION VIEJO MAN HAD LIVED IN 
THE PHILIPPINES AND EVADED INVESTIGATORS FOR YEARS. IN 1989 ALONE HE NETTED 
$500,000. 
</P>

<P>
 A Mission Viejo man described by authorities as the kingpin of an auto-leasing 
scam has been sentenced to three years in prison, a state investigator said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando DeLeon Pangilinan, 28, who has been in custody since March on charges 
of operating a fraudulent leasing business, using methamphetamines and stealing 
four automobiles, was sentenced Friday in Orange County Superior Court, said 
Rande King, an investigator for the state Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was quite a case," said King, who spent several years tracking 
Pangilinan from the Philippines, where he evaded U.S. law enforcement officers 
for three years, to Mission Viejo, where he was apprehended while using an 
alias. "He is the kingpin in the business." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989 alone, Pangilinan netted himself $500,000 by illegally subleasing cars 
for owners who were having financial difficulties, King said. When he was taken 
into custody, he was living in a $500,000 home in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was doing pretty well," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as a subleasing agent, Pangilinan told cash-strapped car owners that he 
would find people willing to take over their payments for a fee ranging from 
$1,500 to $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchase and lease agreements typically prohibit subleasing vehicles without 
consent of the lender, and state law makes it illegal for a third party to 
assist in subleasing and transferring a vehicle without the lender's consent. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pangilinan's case, King said, the monthly payments and fees charged to the 
lessees disappeared, leaving the car owners with the responsibility of back 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Pangilinan did not act alone, authorities said. His partner, Charles Carter, 
49, has also been convicted and sentenced to three years in prison. Another 
suspect, Harry Ellsworth Jack, 69, is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Pangilinan also faced charges of possessing methamphetamines and stealing four 
cars earlier this year by purchasing them under a phony name and letting the 
down-payment checks bounce. Two of those cars have been recovered, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 King said that Pangilinan will probably serve half of his three-year sentence.

 Unisen Inc. appears to be climbing the fast track to success. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin-based maker of health club and home exercise equipment said that 
the nationwide health craze has pushed sales significantly, thanks in large 
part to the introduction four months ago of its Star Step stair-climbing 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new record and we anticipate this growth to continue," said Jim 
McPartland, executive vice president of the privately held company. 
</P>
<P>
 And while company officials decline to say just how much money it is making, 
company spokesman David Jahr said that the company has doubled production to 
1,000 units a month in February from 500 units a month in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people getting into fitness these days," said Jahr. 
</P>
<P>
 That new rush of orders has caused Unisen to increase its payroll from 125 
workers to 175 last month, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also manufactures a line of treadmill machines and other 
cardiovascular exercise equipment, selling them in 55 nations to individuals, 
health clubs, hotels, high schools and universities.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BANK TO EXPAND, MOVE TO ANAHEIM; FINANCE: THE INSTITUTION, 
BASED IN DOWNEY FOR 30 YEARS, HOPES TO RAISE UP TO $20 MILLION TO ACQUIRE NEW 
ORANGE COUNTY BRANCHES.

<P>
 Signaling plans to expand its operations in Orange County, Southern California 
Bank said Monday that it will move its headquarters from Downey to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, pending regulatory approval, would make Southern California Bank, 
with $405 million in assets, the biggest bank based in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Hartwig, president and chief executive officer of the bank and its 
holding company, SC Bancorp, said the bank has filed an application with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission to conduct a rights offering that could 
bring in $16 million to $20 million for expansion. A rights offering gives 
existing shareholders the right to buy newly issued shares; if they decline, 
the bank would sell the stock to other buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Bank has 15 branches, about half of which are in Orange 
County. Hartwig said he would seek to purchase one to five more branches here, 
or about $150 million to $200 million in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the bank is seeking ailing Orange County banks that have operations 
similar to Southern California Bank's: serving middle-market consumers and 
small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank has been based in Downey for 30 years, but "because of the downturn 
in aerospace and defense, the area has lost many small businesses that provided 
ancillary support services," Hartwig said. More of the bank's customers are now 
located in north Orange County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, to be completed in June, would involve relocating about a dozen 
employees. The bank will operate from a temporary headquarters at 3800 E. La 
Palma Ave. and will choose a permanent site after making its intended branch 
acquisitions, Hartwig said.

 Horrified by FDA: He calls them horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
 David Anast, publisher of the Biomedical Market Newsletter in Costa Mesa, has 
decided to take on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and its longstanding 
reputation for dragging its regulatory feet by launching a new column about the 
slowdown in medical device approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts suggest that the slowdown in the FDA's approval process costs 
the industry millions of dollars every year and puts at risk some patients 
awaiting new medical treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Anast said the "FDA Horror Stories" column is a long overdue forum to air 
frustrations about the time it takes for the FDA to give the nod for new 
products to be sold on the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there was no earlier central forum for medical device executives to 
air their opinions, Anast said that news about the column has spread quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has taken off like a rocket," Anast said. "We got calls from all over the 
world. It has really hit a raw nerve in the (medical device) community."

 Slow Recovery: Tokos Medical Corp. in Santa Ana, a provider of nursing 
services for women threatened with premature childbirth, is seeing a comeback 
of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which posted a stinging $26-million loss for 1993, said it is 
experiencing a slow-but-steady recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 One indication is a so-called "patient census index," which compares all the 
services the company has administered in any given month to the business it 
conducted in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a just-released report, Tokos nurses treated 26% fewer patients 
this February than they did in January, 1993 -- the lowest point since the 
company started cataloguing its patient census data. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past three months, business has been growing incrementally, with 
the company treating only 16% fewer patients in April than it did in January, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an indication of business trends," said chief financial officer 
Nicolas A. Mione. "It appears we are stabilizing."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harmony Holdings Inc., the Burbank producer of television commercials and 
music videos, reported a profit of $120,505 for the third quarter that ended 
March 31, in contrast to a loss of $713,387 in the first quarter the previous 
year. The turnaround was on a revenue increase of 68% to $12.28 million from 
$7.30 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months that ended March 31, the company's loss widened to $1.87 
million, compared with a loss of $1.48 million reported for the same period a 
year before. Revenue for the nine months was $31.96 million, 83% higher than 
$17.49 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the first-quarter results to an increase in the number

REGIONAL EARNINGS: LESLIE'S POOLMART LOSES $3.57 MILLION IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leslie's Poolmart, a Chatsworth retailer of swimming pool supplies, reported a 
first-quarter loss of $3.57 million compared with a loss of $3.63 million a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales for the quarter ended March 31 were up 14% to $13.3 million from $11.6 
million in the comparable period a year earlier. The company usually has 
significant losses in the first quarter because swimming pool products are in 
low demand during the winter.

TEMBLOR DASHED TURNAROUND HOPE FOR SOME BANKS; ECONOMY: IN THE MARCH QUARTER, 
FOUR OF THE AREA'S LARGEST BANKS AND S&LS REPORTED LOSSES OR LOWER PROFITS, AND 
WEAKNESS MAY LINGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Ures, chairman of American Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks, began the 
year with high hopes of breaking through the region's nagging recession. But 
then came the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just put a halt to everything," said Ures. "Financing stopped because 
people stopped buying. Everybody was sort of numb. For a three-month period, it 
was like we were in a vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
 Ures says his bank would have had a terrific first quarter without the 
earthquake. As it turned out, American Pacific's earnings for the latest 
quarter dropped 7% from a year earlier to $524,000, because of a $200,000 
charge for quake damage to bank-owned property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake was also felt by other local banks and savings and 
loans, which had been showing signs of resurgence. And the quake's impact on 
these financial institutions isn't over. 
</P>
<P>
 In the January-March quarter, four out of the eight largest banks and savings 
and loans based in the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County reported losses 
or lower profits than a year earlier. Great Western Bank and CU Bancorp posted 
strong gains, and Ventura-based Levy Bancorp returned to profitability after 
seven straight quarters of losses. 
</P>
<P>
 An eighth institution, Citadel Holding, the Glendale-based parent of Fidelity 
Federal Bank, has not released its first-quarter results. But the S&L lost $67 
million last year and is up for sale. Citadel has proposed a plan to free 
itself from nearly $500 million of troubled real estate assets, but that is 
being challenged in a lawsuit filed in March by one of Citadel's creditors, 
Chase Manhattan Bank. Making matters worse, Citadel's three-story Fidelity 
Federal building in Sherman Oaks was closed due to severe damage from the 
quake, and remains boarded up. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the region's mainly small financial institutions did not keep pace 
with the state's largest banks and S&Ls, which showed robust gains in the first 
quarter, reflecting the state's fledgling recovery. And in a measure of how 
well an institution uses its assets, in the first quarter none of the region's 
eight banks and S&Ls turned in a return on average assets of above 1%, which is 
considered a strong showing. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Glendale Federal Bank recorded the biggest loss in the latest quarter 
-- $144 million versus a profit of $45 million for the same period a year 
earlier. Glendale Federal, which operates on a fiscal year that ends June 30, 
said the quarterly loss included a write-off of $136 million of goodwill and 
other assets related to the sale of the bank's Florida branches. Glendale 
Federal, for now the nation's fifth-largest S&L, last month agreed to sell its 
60 Florida branches for $243.5 million to Barnett Banks Inc., as part of 
Glendale Federal's efforts to boost its capital reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 With the latest loss, Glendale Federal's losses through the nine months ended 
March 31 totaled $203 million, four times more than a year earlier. But 
Glendale Federal has been making progress in reducing its non-performing 
assets, or delinquent loans and foreclosed properties. But the earthquake added 
$20 million of non-performing assets in the latest quarter, and Glendale 
Federal says it expects more bad loans to show up in the current quarter as a 
result of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake was also behind the 40% earnings decline at TransWorld Bancorp, 
the Sherman Oaks-based parent of TransWorld Bank. TransWorld took a $300,000 
charge for quake damage to two of its branches and a foreclosed property, and 
that left its earnings of $268,000 in the latest quarter well short of the 
$450,000 it made a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 John Marquis, TransWorld's executive vice president, said if there is a 
recovery, it's spotty. "We're still not seeing very strong demand for 
commercial loans," he said, "but we would like to make some." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the earthquake did not affect the two institutions based in 
Ventura County -- Levy Bancorp and Ventura County National Bancorp -- both of 
which have been struggling but made big strides in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Levy Bancorp, parent of Bank of A. Levy, posted a quarterly profit of $1.36 
million, in contrast to a loss of $800,000 a year earlier. The profit, the 
first for Levy since the first quarter of 1992, was due to the sale of real 
estate and dramatically lower loan-loss provisions. The bank set aside just 
$1,000 in loan-loss reserves in the latest quarter, compared with $3.8 million 
a year earlier. It was unclear whether Levy could sustain those earnings in the 
upcoming quarters. About 5% of Levy's overall assets are still in the 
non-performing category; that's about twice the level of healthy banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bancorp, the Oxnard-based parent of Ventura County 
National Bank and Frontier Bank, also put aside much less for loan-loss 
reserves, and that helped cut its loss to $114,000 in the first quarter, from a 
loss of $1.6 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ventura County National Bank remains below certain capital levels that 
federal regulators imposed earlier this year. The bank has until Sept. 30 to 
achieve a so-called Tier 1 capital ratio of 12% and a leverage ratio of 7%. 
Both ratios reflect a bank's equity as a percentage of risk-based assets. As of 
March 31, the bank's Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 7.27% and its leverage ratio 
was 6.01%. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard S. Cupp, the company's president and chief executive officer, has said 
he expects to meet the Sept. 30 deadline. But if he doesn't, the bank could 
face tougher sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 CU Bancorp, the Encino-based parent of California United Bank, posted its 
fifth straight quarter of increased profits, earning $578,000 in the latest 
quarter, up 51% from a year earlier. CU Bancorp went through a painful 
restructuring two years ago, and it has been paying dividends since. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen G. Carpenter, CU Bancorp's chairman and chief executive officer, said 
the recent rise in interest rates will help his and other banks by boosting the 
net interest margin -- or the difference between what banks pay on deposits and 
what they charge on loans -- which is a key measure of a bank's profitability. 
Over time, that margin will widen and as a result should produce higher income 
for financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western Financial Corp., the Chatsworth-based parent of Great Western 
Bank, also turned in a strong first quarter as earnings climbed 10% to $49.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Great Western has disposed of a lot of non-performing assets, most 
of them single-family houses. Great Western, which is the nation's 
second-largest thrift with $37 billion in assets, said it does not expect 
"material losses" from the earthquake. Still, the bank noted that some 2,000 
borrowers had requested forbearance on mortgage loans, and among them, more 
than 200 reported major structural damage to their homes and said they did not 
have earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ures, chairman of American Pacific State Bank, said there may be many more 
earthquake-affected borrowers lurking. "I'm just waiting for the rest of the 
earthquake victims to surface." First-Quarter Report From the Region's Largest

REBUILDING FENCES CAN STRAIN GOOD-NEIGHBOR POLICY; REAL ESTATE: DISPUTES ARISE 
OVER WHO PAYS THE BILL AS RESIDENTS REPAIR THEIR QUAKE-DAMAGED BOUNDARY WALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If good fences make good neighbors, then what is to be said of all the fences 
that turned into rubble with the January earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 That's a question that many neighbors are asking themselves as they deal with 
the task of rebuilding the many fences that were destroyed or damaged and are 
still in need of repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Who pays the bill is the focus of contentiousness by many not-so-neighborly 
neighbors throughout the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The general rule about property line fences -- also known as boundary fences, 
division fences or partition fences -- is that they are co-owned by the 
neighbors using the fence, unless those neighbors agree otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a fence cannot be unilaterally removed and, when one of the properties is 
sold, the new owner acquires mutual ownership of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The mutual ownership of property line fences isn't absolute, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC & Rs) established as part of 
planned-unit developments may address boundary fences specifically and 
apportion different building costs between owners. (You might already have a 
copy of CC & Rs in documents provided by your title company when you bought 
your home. Or you can look it up in the Hall of Records.) Other recorded 
documents may have something to say about the ownership of a boundary fence. 
And, some fences that aren't on the line dividing two properties may in fact be 
the responsibility of one neighbor versus another. 
</P>
<P>
 These are just the general rules. In the real world, arguments are inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a tremendous amount of calls on this issue" since the Northridge 
quake, reported Denise Binder, planning deputy in Los Angeles City Councilwoman 
Laura Chick's district office in Reseda. "These are very difficult problems and 
often very difficult to solve. Everyone gets all emotional because we can't 
help them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city attorney's office has been stepping in with some help 
through its Dispute Resolution Service. "We've been getting a lot of calls from 
neighbors regarding block walls or fences damaged or destroyed during the 
earthquake," said Ruth Kwan, supervising attorney in the consumer protection 
section of the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of volunteer mediators is being made available to help neighbors 
settle their differences voluntarily. First, the mediators try to get the 
neighbors to cooperate by phone. If that fails, the neighbors are invited to 
mediate in downtown Los Angeles or in a satellite office in Reseda. "Our 
dispute resolution isn't based on law but on finding an equitable solution that 
will satisfy both parties," Kwan said. "There is no black-letter law. It comes 
down to a matter of common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense, of course, doesn't always prevail in disputes between neighbors, 
said Alan Kheel, partner at the Sherman Oaks law firm of Reznik & Reznik. His 
advice to homeowners with a felled fence is "get the fence up and argue about 
it later." If all attempts at compromise fail, Kheel said, it is feasible to 
take a neighbor to small claims court for up to $5,000 for their share of fence 
replacement or repair. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even a win in court doesn't necessarily help you collect money from your 
neighbor, though, he said. "If your neighbor has no money, what are you going 
to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 There is very little case law in California related to the maintenance of 
boundary fences. Civil Code Section 841 does, however, state that so-called 
co-terminous owners are mutually bound equally to maintain the boundaries, 
monuments and fences between them. 
</P>
<P>
 And, a property owner who refuses to pay for his share of a property fence and 
then fences off the rest of the property is responsible to later pay the 
neighbor for half of the fence that wasn't paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem with this statute, say local attorneys, is what to do with 
fences that aren't really on a boundary line. In those cases, the owners have 
to just find a way to settle their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the fence is on the property line, the cost is usually shared," said Dan 
Collins, vice president of DJ Fence & Masonry Inc. in Chatsworth. "Some 
neighbors get rowdy and testy, but most have been extremely friendly and 
workable with their neighbors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a six-foot-high fence, Collins said he charges about $12 a linear foot for 
chain-link, $24 for wood, $39 for cinder-block and $44 for so-called Slumpstone 
or adobe brick. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies, he said, are reimbursing most residents for half the cost 
of boundary fences unless the homeowner proves that the fence was all theirs to 
begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 Ty Cavanaugh, owner of Quality Fence Co. in South Gate, reports that business 
is booming. He did about $4 million in fence business last year and expects 
this year to be even more lucrative -- thanks to the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people can't afford half the cost of a new wall or fence, so instead 
they say they are not interested in rebuilding," Cavanaugh said. "Neighbors 
have pretty much been working together to share the cost of rebuilding fences. 
You have to learn to communicate and be creative with your neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he conceded, "the person who initiates the rebuilding seems to usually be 
the person stuck with the bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is helping earthquake victims by paying for chain-link fences 
around properties with swimming pools, Cavanaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also money available though Federal Emergency Management Agency and 
the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, a lot of fence guys are gouging people," Cavanaugh said. 
"There are a lot of renegades out there that aren't using the best materials or 
aren't properly reinforcing new masonry walls with enough steel." 
</P>
<P>
 The best advice is to deal with a licensed contractor and to be sure to follow 
municipal codes, said Frank Orbin, chief of Van Nuys district plan check for 
the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 For masonry walls taller than three feet, six inches, the city now requires a 
building permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Amendments to the code since January also require a two-foot-wide footing 18 
inches below the finished grade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No permit is required for wood or chain-link fences up to 10 feet tall, Orbin 
said, so many homeowners are opting for these cheaper and more hassle-free 
alternatives to masonry. 
</P>
<P>
 Orbin warned, however, that zoning rules usually limit fences to eight feet in 
flat areas and six feet on hillsides, so just because no permit is required 
doesn't mean that it's legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Orbin said, many local communities or planned developments restrict 
certain types of fencing, so it is best to check the rules before starting to 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the many permutations of real estate laws and how to 
cope with your neighbors and fences, you might also buy a copy of "Neighbor 
Law," a consumer guidebook published by the Berkeley-based legal publishing 
company Nolo Press.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: REDKEN ANNOUNCES MOVE TO KENTUCKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Redken Laboratories, the Canoga Park maker of salon products, will sell its 
two buildings in Canoga Park and move to Florence, Ky., by the end of the 
summer, said Howard Geiger, vice president of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 About 360 people are employed at the Canoga Park locations.Many of those 
working in production and management will move with the company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Redken razed about 60,000 square feet of warehouse space at its production 
facility due to damage from the Northridge earthquake, but the rest of the 
complex is still in use. Geiger said earthquake damage is not the reason for 
the move. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which is owned by New York-based Cosmair Inc., U. S. distributor 
of the French company L'Oreal, has had production facilities in both Kentucky 
and Canoga Park for some time and was not fully using either one, Geiger said. 
To become more efficient and expand, the company in recent months decided to 
move all its operations to the newer facility. The Florence plant is about 7 
years old; the Canoga Park plant is about 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Redken is asking $12 million for its two Canoga Park properties.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: NESTLE USA TO BUY 22% STAKE IN DREYER'S ICE CREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nestle USA Inc. in Glendale has agreed to purchase stock and warrants that 
would give it a 22% stake in Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 If all the warrants to purchase Dreyer's shares are exercised, the purchase 
price will total $160 million. 
</P>

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: UNICO AMERICAN CORP. REPORTS HEAVY TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shares of Unico American Corp., an insurance-holding company based in Woodland 
Hills, dropped 12% last week on heavy trading after the firm said its fiscal 
fourth-quarter profit will be less than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 About 49,100 shares changed hands, more than six times the three-month average 
daily trading volume. Unico said an additional $1 million in pretax loss and 
loss adjustment expenses from its insurance operations will result in lower net 
income than in its fiscal third quarter. The company said it expects revenue of 
about $8.9 million in its fiscal fourth-quarter that ended March 31, about the 
same as the third fiscal quarter.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PAC RIM HOLDING LOSES $1.08 MILLION IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pac Rim Holding Corp., a Woodland Hills workers' compensation insurer, 
reported a $1.08-million loss in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the company earned $58,000.Its revenue in the three months ended 
March 31 was $23.6 million, up from the $23.3 million in first-quarter revenue 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Pac Rim said that continuing concern by agents, brokers and policyholders 
about its financial strength and lack of capital hurt its ability to renew 
policies and acquire new business in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The company previously had said its long search for capital led to an 
agreement in April to sell $20 million in convertible debentures to an 
investment partnership controlled by Richard Pickup of Newport Beach. The 
transaction is subject to regulatory and stockholder approval.

coatings, reported a $31,745 net loss for its fiscal second quarter ended March 
31 on a 28% decline in revenue. 
</P>

nearly 26% stake.The Northridge earthquake also hurt the company's results, it 
said.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: VITESSE SEMICONDUCTOR SHIPS HIGH-SPEED CHIPS TO UNISYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vitesse Semiconductor Corp., a Camarillo firm that has struggled to persuade 
computer makers to use its advanced but costly gallium arsenide chips, has 
started shipping its high-speed chips to Unisys Corp., one of the nation's 
leading computer companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Tomasetta, Vitesse's president and chief executive, says it's too soon to 
estimate how the arrangement will affect his firm's bottom line, since only a 
few hundred of the units have been shipped so far. "But this will certainly 
strengthen our credibility in the industry," he said. "It's a very exciting 
mainstream application of our technology." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tomasetta, the newest version of Vitesse's microprocessor, which 
it jointly developed with Unisys, is about 2 1/2 times faster than traditional 
computer chips. He concedes, however, that the unit's relatively high cost has 
been a stumbling block in gaining acceptance in a market that's been hit hard 
by price-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're especially happy that Unisys had to make very few changes to fit our 
chip into its system," he said. "That should impress a lot of potential 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse, which has more than 200 employees at its plant in Camarillo, has 
increased its revenues sharply in recent months, thanks largely to lower prices 
for its newest generation of gallium arsenide chips. The company has also 
instituted tight cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest quarter that ended March 31, revenues surged 44%, to $8.72 
million from $6.07 million a year earlier. The company also trimmed its loss in 
the latest quarter to $1.7 million, compared with a loss of $5.1 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Technology Stock Letter, published in Half Moon Bay, noted 
recently that Vitesse's new chip "is fast and cheap. . . . This could save a 
couple of hundred bucks in a system." The newsletter added that the chances are 
improving for Vitesse to "move its unique (chip) technology into mainstream 
products."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: HUDSON'S GRILL TO SELL 3 RESTAURANTS IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hudson's Grill of America Inc., which moved its headquarters from Ventura to 
Dallas when it changed ownership in mid-1993, has agreed to sell its three 
Ventura County restaurants to buyers who will operate the units as Hudson's 
franchises. A fourth Hudson's Grill, in Ventura, was sold late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the 1950s-themed restaurants -- in Westlake Village and Simi Valley -- 
are to be purchased by a company headed by Davis J. Beckham, a former Hudson's 
vice president and director. The Oxnard unit is to be sold to a firm owned by 
its manager, Alvaro Hernandez, reports Bob Fischer, a Hudson's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer says Hernandez's company will pay $228,000, plus a $25,000 franchise 
fee, and will sign a long-term equipment lease. The price for the Westlake 
Village and Simi Valley units will total only $116,000 but will include 
franchise fees and hefty equipment leases, Fischer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson's has also agreed to sell its Lancaster restaurant and plans to pay 
down its debt to former president Travis Bryant. After the planned sales, all 
but two of the 14 Hudson's Grills will be franchised, Fischer reports. The 
company intends to sell the remaining two units and embark on a nationwide 
franchising program.

 An Indiana company has signed a letter of intent to acquire Wambold Furniture, 
a Simi Valley producer of dining room and bedroom furniture that has been 
operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chromcraft Revington Inc. of Delphi will pay about $5 million for the Simi 
Valley firm, a Chromcraft official says. However, the deal is subject to 
approval by the U. S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Barbara, where Wambold filed 
its Chapter 11 petition. 
</P>
<P>
 Chromcraft, which produces casual dining, occasional and commercial furniture, 
plans to make the Wambold facility its first West Coast plant. Chromcraft, 
whose stock is listed on Nasdaq, had sales of $126 million last year.

WHERE IT'S ALWAYS FREEWAY RUSH HOUR; FIRMS RACE TO MEET QUAKE REPAIR DEADLINES, 
WITH LITTLE ROOM BETWEEN DISASTER AND PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While rebuilding the earthquake-torn eastbound lanes of the Simi Valley 
Freeway in Granada Hills, Brutoco Engineering & Construction Inc. ran into a 
snag. 
</P>
<P>
 After reinforcing steel and concrete was set in a hole, an error in how it was 
placed was discovered. The steel had to be pulled out, adjusted, then put back 
in. These things happen at construction sites. Normally, the situation would be 
reviewed, reports would be filed and arguments would break out. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was no normal job. 
</P>
<P>
 Brutoco, a Fontana-based contractor, is under a frantic, 100-day deadline to 
fulfill its $9.7-million contract as the main contractor on the Simi Valley 
Freeway -- and faces a $50,000 penalty for each day late, or a $50,000 bonus 
for each day it finishes the job ahead of schedule. So, there were no 
disagreements, no lengthy discussions over who was to blame. The mistake was 
fixed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you stand around arguing about reinforcing steel," said Brutoco executive 
vice president, Tom Salata, "that's a $50,000 conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction companies such as Brutoco that are working on earthquake-damaged 
freeways, bridges and ramps are in a pull-out-all-stops race against the clock. 
Under an unusual process of awarding contracts that the state Department of 
Transportation adopted to speed earthquake repairs, these contractors have 
promised to finish their projects in a fraction of the time that they'd take 
under other circumstances, and without the usual allowance for rain delays. 
</P>
<P>
 For the companies that are rebuilding what the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake 
destroyed, it's a big gamble: Finishing by the deadline could mean profits and 
prestige. Failing to make it almost certainly would mean losing money and face. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much room," Salata said, "between disaster and profit." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, after much fanfare, the Santa Monica Freeway reopened 69 days ahead 
of schedule -- which earned the chief contractor, C. C. Myers Inc., a bonus of 
$14.8 million, in addition to its $14.9-million contract. Now eyes are now 
turned to other major earthquake projects on the Simi Valley, Antelope Valley 
and Golden State freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 For the contractors, it's a gamble made all the more intense because the 
dearth of private building in the past few years in California has forced them 
to rely on public works projects. These companies range from small, 
family-owned subcontractors that depend on one or two projects a year to large 
corporations trying to juggle several jobs at once. While the earthquake-repair 
work is risky, many of these firms didn't want to miss the opportunity 
presented by such high-profile and possibly lucrative contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Brutoco and another primary freeway contractor, E. L. Yeager Construction 
Co., will win their bet against time. Even so, big profits on the freeway quake 
repairs are by no means assured. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yeager, a Riverside company with about $125 million in annual revenue, is 
finishing one month early the rebuilding of two Golden State Freeway bridges at 
Gavin Canyon, a tight, narrow valley fit between steep, rocky cliffs 23 miles 
north of downtown Los Angeles. On Wednesday, the southbound lanes of the Golden 
State will open, and the northbound lanes will open Thursday. The fast work 
will earn Yeager a $4.5-million bonus on top of its $14.8-million contract. An 
additional bonus is being negotiated for other work Yeager completed to make 
the bridges more resistant to earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Brutoco is expected to wind up its repairs of the eastbound Simi 
Valley Freeway, a few days ahead of its May 22 deadline. Brutoco's bonus is 
still being negotiated, but it could be more than $1 million because Caltrans 
added work after the original contract, said Jerry Baxter, Caltrans district 
director. That's good news for Brutoco, which takes in about $40 million in 
revenue annually, and for Salata and other co-owners of the company, because 
they pledged their houses and cars as collateral for the surety bond required 
to ensure completion of building contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big project still under way is at the interchange of the Golden State 
and Antelope Valley freeways. Highland-based Kasler Corp. is working feverishly 
to meet its July 28 deadline to rebuild two bridges connecting the freeways. It 
was here that an off-duty Los Angeles police officer was killed when his 
motorcycle shot off the edge of a collapsed bridge after the earthquake. 
Kasler's $19.6-million contract includes a $100,000-a-day bonus or penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Yeager and Brutoco will finish early, Baxter expects the 
companies' profits to be significantly less than their bonuses because they had 
to pay for enormous amounts of overtime. To get the earthquake repair jobs 
done, their crews worked round-the-clock, seven days a week. At any hour of the 
day or night on the Simi Valley Freeway, Salata said, Brutoco has had 150 
employees working "butt to butt." Supervisors have pulled down 14- to 18-hour 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors routinely tally their expenses weekly, but on the Simi Valley 
Freeway, Brutoco worked so fast that a final verdict on its financial 
performance won't be known for some time. Although Salata expects that his 
company won't lose money, its profit might not be large because of its big 
overtime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, building contractors estimate a gross profit of about 10% in a bid. 
After subtracting taxes and other costs, such as administrative expenses, a 
company would do well to net a 3% or 4% profit. That leaves little room for 
mistakes or delays -- and even less with a late penalty looming. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeager President Carl Boyer said he won't know how well his company did 
financially until it finishes other work, including drains on the Golden State 
Freeway project. "We've done fairly well. But I don't think anybody realizes 
the risk when you bid a job like that. You've got to make every day and every 
hour count." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeager also kept crews working nonstop, rain or shine, aftershocks and all. On 
the day the company won the contract, plans for the Golden State Freeway 
bridges weren't even completed, but Yeager was on the phone ordering all the 
materials it guessed would be needed, instead of spacing out orders over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent a lot of money to accomplish this," said Yeager's project manager, 
Jim Crews. "Two or three stumbles, two or three weeks of bad weather, and we 
would have been paying out of our pocket" to cover losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasler is hoping that it won't encounter such problems as it rebuilds the two 
bridges connecting the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways in four months 
-- a job that normally would take 18 months -- even though it's abandoned some 
of its usual procedures. "Normally, we go back to the office and regroup at the 
end of the day," project manager Gene Boisvert said. "Here, we don't have an 
end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasler faces enormous obstacles. Unlike the flat Santa Monica Freeway, the 
exchange roads Kasler is rebuilding are situated in a canyon in a mountainous 
area. Workers toil on bridges reaching 126 feet high and precariously near 
freeways still open to traffic. Some columns are being raised just feet away 
from railroad tracks, with huge steel caissons to support the concrete columns 
plunging 70 feet into the ground. A main gas line to Los Angeles is in an 
underground vault running through the building site. 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical job, Kasler, a $200-million-a-year company, would have a month 
after winning a bid to plan, mobilize and get quotes from suppliers, Boisvert 
said. This time, the contract for the interchange was awarded March 18, and 
Kasler began work the following day. Boisvert immediately lined up a dozen 
subcontractors, ordered the lumber and got phone numbers where he could reach 
suppliers 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasler's crews are working 11-hour shifts, with one crew falling in behind 
another "like a baton marathon race," Boisvert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans' Baxter said Kasler lost 10 days work when it had to remove a 
previously unknown hunk of buried concrete left from an earlier bridge that 
collapsed in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. Kasler won't be penalized for that, 
Baxter said, although the company is making up time so fast that it could still 
meet its original deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 In their rush to finish, contractors also depend on the dozens of 
subcontractors they've hired for such tasks as drilling, welding, steel and 
electrical work. For these subcontractors, many of which have no bonus promised 
for completing their work early, controlling costs is critical. 
</P>
<P>
 One subcontractor, Tri-City Reinforcing Corp., which installed reinforcing 
steel on the Santa Monica Freeway, is now working on the Golden State-Antelope 
Valley freeway interchange project under a $3.5-million subcontract with 
Kasler. Of that, 55% pays for steel "rebar," Tri-City owner Dean Bubion said. 
That leaves labor, the big intangible cost on any job. One steelworker costs 
$40 an hour in salary and benefits, more if there's overtime. Even though 
Tri-City gets paid every two weeks -- as opposed to each month on normal jobs 
-- for the small firm to come up with the cash to meet its payroll isn't easy, 
Bubion said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tri-City made a profit on its $4.5-million subcontract on the Santa Monica 
Freeway, Bubion said. But the Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway job is 
tougher, he said, and "we're hoping not to lose money." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help when Tri-City workers mistakenly installed single hoops of 
reinforcing steel for three columns instead of the required double hoops. 
Fixing the error cost Tri-City time and money, but Bubion said he took it in 
stride. "You don't want to beat up on a guy who's been working 70 hours a 
week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bubion looks forward to completing the column work and going full speed on the 
bridges. That's when Tri-City's ironworkers -- whose jobs are considered the 
most grueling of the construction trade -- can show their metal by trying to 
catch up with the carpenters working just ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the money, Bubion said the earthquake jobs have given his 5-year-old 
firm valuable exposure at a time when construction work is scarce. Previously, 
Tri-City was known as a Metro Rail specialist, but its next Metro Rail contract 
doesn't start until December. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be plenty more work for qualified firms, said Baxter at Caltrans. 
After the earthquake repairs wind up by the end of the year, 800 bridges in Los 
Angeles and Ventura counties will still need retrofitting, and that work will 
continue for several years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bubion isn't worrying about that now. "Doing this job in three months," he 
said, "doesn't give you a lot of time to get more work."

GARAGE SALE LIMIT GIVEN INITIAL OK; GOVERNMENT: SANTA ANA LAW WOULD PERMIT 
SALES ON ONLY FOUR WEEKENDS PER YEAR. COUNCIL HOPES TO CURB ILLEGAL BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to clean up the city's neighborhoods and crack down on illegal 
businesses, the City Council on Monday gave preliminary approval to an 
ordinance allowing garage sales only on the first weekend in March, June, 
September and December.  
</P>
<P>
 The campaign to restrict the sales to four weekends a year grew out of 
residents' complaints that such sales were unsightly junk-fests, often covering 
for small businesses operating regularly out of driveways and parking lots.  
</P>
<P>
 "Other things have been tried and they have not worked," said resident Joe 
Vielma. "I hope this gives you the kind of control you need to clean up the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the proposed ordinance, however, have countered that the sales are 
simply a way to earn a little cash in a tough economy. The sales also provide 
the only affordable merchandise to Santa Ana's poorest residents, many of whom 
don't have cars to get to the closest swap meet, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To dictate to people how they can do it, when they can do it, that to me is 
wrong," resident Arturo Jacques said Monday. The City Council last month 
endorsed the idea of allowing sales only on four specified weekends. But 
Councilman Ted R. Moreno asked that an ordinance that would have allowed sales 
on two weekends in May and two in October be modified to allow them once every 
three months instead, to accommodate residents moving from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the revised ordinance Monday on first reading, and must 
vote on it again next month before it becomes law. The council agreed Monday to 
review the ordinance in six months and decide whether it is working. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ordinance receives final approval next month, city staff members said, 
all residents will receive notices with their water bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales are a constant occurrence in some Santa Ana neighborhoods, where 
residents scatter used clothing, appliances, furniture and even tires and 
television sets across front lawns, driveways and commercial parking lots. Some 
hold one or more sales a week. 
</P>
<P>
 At a council meeting last month, more than half a dozen people spoke in favor 
of a crackdown, complaining that their neighborhoods increasingly looked like 
"a Third World country." 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent sales violate existing city law, which allows only two garage sales a 
year per address. But code enforcement officials, who estimate there are 300 to 
500 garage sales on any weekend day, say the law has been difficult to enforce.

SCHOOL BUS BILL WOULD REQUIRE FLASHING LIGHTS; SAFETY: PARENTS OF BOY KILLED 
CROSSING STREET PROMPT BERGESON'S PROPOSED LEGISLATION TO STOP TRAFFIC WHENEVER 
CHILDREN ARE DISEMBARKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Reacting to the death of a 7-year-old boy struck by a pickup truck as he got 
off a school bus in Laguna Niguel, an Orange County lawmaker is preparing a 
bill to make bus drivers flash warning lights requiring traffic to stop 
whenever children are disembarking. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) said Monday she plans to introduce the 
measure later this week in hopes of changing the current law, which requires 
that warning lights be activated only if the bus driver believes children will 
be crossing the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas E. Lanni was killed on April 22 while crossing Aliso Niguel in front of 
a stopped school bus, according to authorities. The bus' warning lights were 
not flashing. At least three of the children who disembarked at the stop live 
on the other side of the street, but the bus driver told investigators he was 
unaware any would be crossing to get home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni's family had just moved to the area from New York. It was only his 
second day of school and he was riding the bus for the first time. The boy got 
off the bus one stop too early, apparently by mistake, then was hit as he tried 
to cross to a gated housing complex that he probably believed was his 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson met last week with the boy's father, Thomas W. Lanni, who asked that 
the senator sponsor the legislation. The child's parents say they plan to push 
hard to see that the bill becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no money in the world that is ever going to bring back my little 
boy," said Barbara Lanni, the child's mother. "We just want to make sure that 
no other family has to go through what we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson said she was moved by the family's pleas and hoped to propel the bill 
quickly through the legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that it takes a tragedy of this type to get us to look at 
changing the law," Bergeson said. "One would hope that when children's lives 
are concerned, we would err on the side of caution." 
</P>
<P>
 Under existing law, all cars must stop and wait when the warning lights on a 
school bus are activated, but the driver is required to turn on the flashing 
red signals only when a student will be crossing the street. In addition, the 
driver must escort all pupils in preschool through the eighth grade and carry a 
hand-held "STOP" sign to alert approaching vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson's bill would require drivers to activate the warning lights at all 
bus stops, even those where no children are expected to cross a street. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said, one potential sticking point could be the effect of the 
proposed law on traffic. Law enforcement authorities might balk at the use of 
the warning lights on crowded multilane thoroughfares where the flashing 
warning lights could cause congestion or accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 But such arguments drew the ire of the boy's father. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is ridiculous," said Lanni, an electrical engineer. "What situation 
could be more life threatening than a child leaving a school bus? I don't care 
if the bus stops on the 405 Freeway -- those flashing lights should be turned 
on. If it's an inappropriate place because of heavy traffic, they should move 
the school bus stop someplace safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from a blanket requirement that the warning lights be used at all school 
bus stops, Lanni said he would like to see a law requiring that school 
districts adopt safety procedures for bus drivers, improve safety training and 
carefully monitor driver adherence to the rules. He would also like to see a 
requirement that all school buses be equipped with flip-out stop signs, which 
are deployed when the bus stops to let off children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like common sense," Lanni said. "It's hard to imagine that here 
we are in 1994 and these kinds of things aren't already in place. A simple law 
requiring that school buses have flashing lights when they stop might have been 
enough to save my son's life." 
</P>
<P>
 The parents filed a $10-million claim with the Capistrano Unified School 
District after the boy's death, but the push for changes in state law has 
nothing to do with the case against the school district, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the very least, we feel we owe it to our son's memory to get the law 
changed," Thomas Lanni said. "I don't think we could live with ourselves if 
another child got killed the same way and we hadn't done something about it."

FLEAS WAKE UP HUNGRY; PESTS: LATE SPRING RAINS HAVE BROUGHT DORMANT EGGS TO 
LIFE. EXPERTS PREDICT AN EXPLOSION IN NUMBERS OF THE HIGH-JUMPING, 
BLOOD-SUCKING INSECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Awakening like a hibernating bear, the common flea is coming to life again 
after its long winter slumber, and it's hungry for blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Warmer temperatures and increased humidity are pumping life into dormant flea 
eggs, which have hidden all winter in yards, beneath rosebushes and in sidewalk 
cracks, and experts say this year will be a fierce season of flea fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the late rains, you can bet we'll see a lot of fleas this year. Now 
is the time to start treating your house, your yard and your pet," said Larry 
Day of the Grand Avenue Pet Hospital in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleas reproduce best in warm, damp environments. By late spring and early 
summer, there is literally a population explosion of the pests. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Orange County, pet stores have reported increased flea product 
sales, pet hospitals are treating higher numbers of cats and dogs with skin 
irritations caused by fleas bites and pest-control companies are busy making 
house calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, Americans spend nearly $1 billion on flea control and prevention, 
according to Miles Inc. of Kansas City, a maker of flea-control products. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the flea season peaks in midsummer, now is a good time to commence 
the battle against the high-stepping, blood-sucking insect, Day said, because 
early action prevents flea infestation later. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to start using sprays on the yard as well as inside the house. One 
flea becomes a thousand fleas real quick," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the war against fleas particularly challenging is their four-stage 
breeding cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 A female flea lays about 50 eggs every day. The eggs, which resemble grains of 
salt, are resistant to pesticides. A small larvae hatches from an egg and spins 
a silky web around itself in the pupal stage of development. Finally, an adult 
flea emerges. 
</P>
<P>
 From start to finish, reproduction takes two weeks in optimum weather. In cold 
temperatures, a flea egg remains dormant indefinitely until spurred by warm 
temperatures and humidity. The flea's average life span is about eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 So even if a dog or cat has been dipped in flea bath and the house has been 
fogged, eggs in the carpet will often hatch another batch. Eliminating them 
requires patience and persistence, Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleas live off a steady diet of blood from mammals and birds. Incredibly 
strong for its minute size, the common flea -- the size of the ball in a 
ballpoint pen -- can jump 13 inches. The wingless insect, which moves easily 
between animals, punctures the skin with its sharp beak and sucks blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Since almost the beginning of time, fleas have hopped on Earth. In the frozen 
tundra and in archeological digs around the world, ancient flea remnants have 
been discovered, according to Rick Henderson of Fleabusters in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 14th Century, fleas played a role in the death of nearly a third of 
Europe when the bubonic plague spread across the continent. Fleas passed on the 
disease, also known as the Black Death, to humans after sucking infected blood 
from rodents. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, fleas still pose a health risk, said Dr. James Webb of the Orange 
County Vector Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleas can carry murine typhus, a debilitating disease that causes severe 
flu-like symptoms, Webb said. The disease, which is most common among the 
homeless, is spread to people by fleas that have bitten opossums, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pets, however, suffer the greatest harm from fleas. The insects carry dog and 
cat tapeworms that infest the animals' intestines. In addition, many dogs and 
cats suffer allergic reactions to flea bites, often leading to severe skin 
irritations and sores. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a dog with sensitive skin could suffer incessant itching and 
irritation from just a single bite, said veterinarian Steve Kubelun from 
Woodbridge Animal Hospital in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Pets aggravate their suffering with endless scratching that causes soreness or 
lesions that require medical treatment, Kubelun said. 
</P>
<P>
 The itching can also affect a pet's attitude as well. Covered with burning 
bumps and new bite marks every few minutes, the family dog can become 
irascible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've noticed a change in my two dogs in the last few weeks," said A.J. Floyd 
of Westminster, who owns a German shepherd and an Akita. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up to the sound of scratching this morning," Floyd said. "When I 
looked up at my German shepherd, I could tell that he was really annoyed." 
Biting Time In Orange County, the recent combination of damp weather and humid 
days has created a breeding ground for fleas. These wingless, bloodsucking 
insects live on mammals and birds, often causing discomfort for both pets and 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Hazards The red, itchy welts fleas leave on pets can cause allergic 
reactions or tapeworms. Watch for these symptoms: Excessive scratching and fur 
loss. Changes in eating habits; loose stools. Fighting Infestation To battle a 
flea colony, attack where they live, namely in carpets and wherevr pets sleep. 
Wash pet bedding frequently Vacuum often Keep pets off upholsterd furniture 
Choose aerosols or foggers and outdoor treatment that kill eggs as well as 
adult fleas Bathe and dip pet regularly; treat pets with flea powder Add 1 1/2 
teaspoon brewer's yeast to pet food; it gives pet an ordor that repels fleas 
but isn't detectable to pet owners. Sources: Western Exterminator Co., World

FUTURE OF DANA POINT DEVELOPMENT IN DOUBT; GOVERNMENT: OPPONENTS OF HEADLANDS 
RESORT PLAN WIN APPROVAL FOR CITYWIDE REFERENDUM. COUNCIL BACKING IS SUSPENDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A $500-million resort plan for the Headlands in Dana Point was placed in 
jeopardy Monday when the county registrar of voters approved a petition calling 
for a citywide referendum on the development. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Jerry Patterson said the action forces the City Council to either 
rescind last month's approval of the project or put it up for a vote.  
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose the council could refuse to act, but I think that is very 
unlikely," Patterson said. The council must make that decision at its May 24 
meeting, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the council's 4-1 approval of the plan is suspended, meaning 
that it and a detailed development agreement, are "inoperative, unenforceable," 
Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Headlands plan, as approved by the council April 5, entitles the landowner 
to build a 400-room hotel, two commercial centers and 370 homes on the 121-acre 
peninsula. On April 26, the council approved the development agreement that 
binds the city to details of the plan for at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the local group that collected more than 3,800 signatures over 15 
days last month were jubilant. Most of the plan's opponents are seeking to 
preserve more of the peninsula as a natural resource while also arguing that 
the project allows too much residential density. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm elated," said Jack Roberts, a Dana Point real estate broker who has been 
one of the leaders of a coalition of local groups attempting to downscale the 
plan. "I'm glad we're going to get a chance to vote on this. A lot of people 
think (the plan) is too massive." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's proponents, including the city's Chamber of Commerce, insist it 
will be a financial boon to the city, which relies on hotel taxes for about 
one-third of its $13-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Eileen Krause, a project supporter, said she welcomes a vote 
on the plan if that's what people want. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have absolutely no intention of rescinding it," Krause said. "I think this 
is a super opportunity to finally see who represents what around here. I think 
the council has represented the majority of the citizens . . . and I think the 
public will ultimately support it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1940s, the Headlands property has been owned by the M.H. Sherman Co. 
and Chandis Securities Co. Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the 
financial holdings of the Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times 
Mirror Co., which publishes the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan has been supported by the city Planning Commission and the City 
Council after many hours of public review," said Dan T. Daniels, president of 
Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co. "I would hope the citizens would follow 
the lead of their elected and appointed representatives." 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Sharon L. Waits said the council has three options if it chooses to 
put the plan up to a vote -- call a special election, put the vote on the 
November general election ballot or wait until the city election in June, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition was submitted too late to qualify for the next City Council 
election on June 7, Waits said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters would be asked to either approve or reject the Headlands plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Krause said she would prefer the election be held in November because it's 
less costly and voter turnout is likely to be better. A special election costs 
the city about $35,000, compared with the $15,000 cost of adding a city vote to 
a general election, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you get a broader input during a November election," Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, the petitioners had to collect at least 1,912 signatures of 
registered voters, a figure that represents 10% of the city's registered 
voters, Waits said. 
</P>
<P>
 The petitioners turned in two petitions on May 4 that each contained 3,800 
signatures.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CITY TO SEEK $650,000 FOR AID TO HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is expected today to initiate steps that could bring the 
city's housing authority an estimated $650,000 in federal funding to help 
provide shelter to disabled homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 A council motion will allow the city staff to apply for funds from the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 If the request is granted, the money would pay for 100 rental assistance 
vouchers to aid low-income homeless people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will make special efforts to help homeless people who are 
mentally ill. According to the city staff, there are more than 1,000 mentally 
ill homeless people in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 To provide the services, the city intends to form a partnership with the 
Mental Health Assn. of Orange County, HOMES (Helping Our Mentally Ill 
Experience Success), and the County of Orange Health Care Agency, all of which 
already work with mentally ill adults. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action today, the council will tout its accomplishments in 1993-94. 
Among a dozen achievements that will be cited are the grand opening of The 
Pond, reorganization of the Police Department, and an "aggressive effort to 
maintain Anaheim's residential utility rates at levels as much as 20% below 
competing utilities." MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LAGUNA NIGUEL TOP BIKE-FRIENDLY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Bicycle Coalition has named Laguna Niguel the county's most 
"bicycle-friendly" city. 
</P>
<P>
 The town ranked first this year in the coalition's second annual Bicycle 
Friendly Cities Contest. Cities were judged on steps they took in 1993 to 
promote cycling and on the number of existing miles of bike lanes they had 
developed. Last year's contest winner, Irvine, placed second, and San Juan 
Capistrano came in third this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a surprise -- we figured Irvine would take it again because of all 
their existing (bike lanes, lockers and racks)," said Jim Konopka, treasurer of 
the 125-member coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 But Laguna Niguel scored big, Konopka said, because of a program in its 
elementary schools that teaches children bicycling safety and because the city 
already had about 37 miles of on-street bike lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel also added 18 miles of on-street bike lanes last year, and 
officials have plans to continue creating bike lanes along major roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old bicycle advocacy group ranked 19 cities that responded to the 
survey. The remaining 12 cities in the county were disqualified for not 
returning an 11-page questionnaire that coalition members say was sent to each 
city hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities gained points if they created new bike lanes and lost points if they 
removed any. Each town also scored points if, for example, officials had 
applied for grants to build more bike racks or lockers, cleaned and maintained 
their bike paths regularly or aggressively enforced vehicle codes that pertain 
to cycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities also raked in points if they had created a citizen bicycle committee or 
had adopted ordinances requiring bike racks or lockers in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove, which ranked last a year ago, rose to eighth place this year. 
Konopka said Garden Grove officials appear far more committed to providing new 
bike lanes. The city has developed a bicycle route master plan and has applied 
for state and federal grants to fund new on-street lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities ranking between fourth and 19th place in the contest are as follows: 
Lake Forest, Costa Mesa, Dana Point, Tustin, Garden Grove, Mission Viejo, 
Fountain Valley, Santa Ana, Cypress, Villa Park, Brea, Anaheim, Los Alamitos, 
Yorba Linda, Fullerton and Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members said surveys were not returned by the cities of Buena Park, 
Huntington Beach, Laguna Beach, Laguna Hills, La Habra, La Palma, Newport 
Beach, Orange, Placentia, San Clemente, Stanton and Westminster.ANDREW LePAGE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; VOTER INTEREST HIGH IN HASTINGS' RUNOFF WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fierce election fight for a City Council seat in the Old Town district 
aroused voter interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's runoff election, won by Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings, drew 
about 300 more people to the polls than March's general election, City Clerk 
Joanne M. Yeo said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 3,300 registered voters in Old Town, 1,485 voted in the May 10 runoff, 
compared to 1,168 who voted in general election on March 28, Yeo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeo and others attributed the turnout to interest in the race between Hastings 
and businessman and teacher Jim Klisanin. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings and Klisanin differed on issues ranging from development and taxes to 
alcohol sales on Main Street. Hastings won with 839 votes to Klisanin's 631. 
</P>
<P>
 For four months, Old Town residents were bombarded with mailers, yard signs 
and assorted charges and countercharges. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings' victory means that all three council members who sought reelection 
this year will return. Mayor Gwen Forsythe, who represents the Marina Hill, and 
Councilman William J. Doane, who represents part of Leisure World, were 
reelected outright in March's general election. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent victories came despite of backing a measure last year that more 
than doubled the tax residents pay on gas, electric and telephone bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Their election opponents criticized the tax hike, saying the council should 
have looked for less painful ways of balancing the city's books. But council 
members countered that the tax was the only way of dealing with a budget 
shortfall without making massive cuts in city services, including police. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will decide later this year whether to extend the tax through 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of the two other council members -- George Brown of Leisure World 
and Frank Laszlo of College Park East -- expire in 1996.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; DISNEY MAKES CASE AGAINST HOTEL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co. and several hotel managers on Monday voiced opposition to 
a proposed hotel development near Disneyland, saying that the impacts of the 
project have not been fully reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are fatal flaws in the (developer's) documents," Disney attorney Marian 
A. Harvey told the city's Planning Commission at a public hearing."It would be 
an abuse of the city's discretion to approve this project." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's planning staff has recommended that the commission approve the 
plans of Tarsadia Inc., a Costa Mesa firm that hopes to build three hotels with 
as many as 834 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing testimony Monday from Disney and area hotel representatives, the 
commission requested further information from the city staff and continued the 
hearing until June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials contend that Tarsadia failed to analyze the environmental 
impact of its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, they are concerned about Tarsadia's requests for variances on zoning, 
sign and landscaping requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 City planning officials and Frank Elfend, Tarsadia's planning consultant, said 
that impacts of the Tarsadia project were fully reviewed when Disney conducted 
its own environmental study for the proposed $3-billion Disneyland Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Elfend added that the variances being sought by the developer are far fewer 
than the ones that Disney requested from the city for its resort project, which 
calls for a new theme park named Westcot, more than 5,000 hotel rooms and two 
of the nation's largest parking garages. 
</P>
<P>
 Elfend charged that Disney officials oppose Tarsadia because they want to 
eliminate potential competition in the hotel business. MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CHEMISTRY WAS RIGHT AT VILLA PARK HIGH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two tenth-grade Villa Park High School students have won top honors from the 
local American Chemical Society, which named them the smartest beginning 
chemistry pupils in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Kim, 15, placed first in the society's annual two-hour exam, which 
grilled more than 150 high school students from throughout the county on the 
periodic table, complicated chemical equations, stoichiometry and other 
scientific concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said he was one of the last to finish the test, and "so I figured there 
would be a lot of perfect scores and I would place on the bottom 10%. . . . But 
I felt like it was pretty easy, and when I found out I won, it was a big, big, 
big surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 His classmate, Vivian Chiang, 14, placed second in the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were awarded $100 savings bonds. Society officials said the annual 
exam boosts interest in chemistry and motivates students to pursue careers in 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of Richard and Vivian," said their chemistry teacher, Steven 
Ebert. "They did a lot of hard work preparing for the test, and I'm tickled 
pink that Villa Park students have done so well this year." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in the society's 28-year history that the top honors 
went to two Villa Park High School students. 
</P>
<P>
 At an awards ceremony last week, other students also received $100 savings 
bonds, provided by Chevron Petroleum Technology Co. of La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Christina Nagel of Fullerton High School and Brianna Keilar of La Paz 
Intermediate School were honored for presenting the best science projects at a 
fair last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, eight other students were awarded $100 savings bonds for being 
chosen to compete in the U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad. They are: Karen 
Cheng of Dana Hills High School; Steven Tu of El Toro High School; James Black 
and Tal Poznansky of Irvine High School; James Kingston of John F. Kennedy High 
School; David Snyder of Los Alamitos High School; and Tiffany Yu and Glenn Gaza 
of Valencia High School.MIMI KO

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Stanton Community Safety Committee has recommended increased police 
patrols, expanded code enforcement and neighborhood preservation programs and 
increased graffiti abatement to improve safety and fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, which made the recommendations in a report to the City Council, 
has been meeting for five months and was composed of seven residents appointed 
by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided recently to meet with the committee on May 25 to talk 
about the 55-page report. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommendations also call for the city to work with community organizations, 
businesses and residents to reduce crime. The committee met for more than 50 
hours, according to chairman Harrison Hamada. Mayor Sal Sapiensaid he hopes the 
report will help the council improve community safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In other business last week, the council gave a commendation to Alejandro 
Mejia, 19, an assistant apartment manager who in February saved a 1-year-old 
child who choked on a penny. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fire Department, which was called in the incident, credited 
Mejia with saving the baby because he thought to check the child's throat when 
it stopped breathing, according to Sapien. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia shook out the coin and the child later recovered, said Sapien, who 
presented the commendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thank God that I was there," Mejia said.WILLSON CUMMER

 People interested in purchasing homes in the city might qualify for the 
county's First-Time Homebuyers Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program provides qualified buyers with federal income tax credits that 
they can use to reduce their mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The credits give people who normally wouldn't be able to afford monthly house 
payments the tax breaks needed to pay a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for the program, an applicant's household income must be less than 
$56,500 for a one or two-person family, and less than $64,975 for a family of 
three or more people, said Lee Whittenberg, the Seal Beach planning director. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase price of a home must be less than $225,900, he said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; CITY WILL SEEK LOAN TO BUILD ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided to apply for a federal loan that will help 
finance construction of a new community arts center at 15th and Monroe streets. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the $5.3-million loan from the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development would also be used to buy land and pay for improvements, including 
a park, near the proposed site. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that additional money for the $7-million project will come from 
the Redevelopment Agency and the $1.3 million that the city received five years 
ago from the local cable television franchise holder. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the arts center is contingent on the city's receiving the 
federal loan money. 
</P>
<P>
 The community arts center would be built on 3 1/2 acres of land bought from 
Westminster School District and would be done in an Old English design. 
</P>
<P>
 It would feature a 475-seat theater, a lobby for art exhibits and a terrace 
for private and public events. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be meeting and dining rooms and a parking lot to accommodate more 
than 100 cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The building would replace the Cultural Arts Center on Hoover Street that was 
built in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 for the arts center last week, with Councilman Craig 
Schweisinger in dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweisinger said that because of the city's tough fiscal situation, "now may 
not be the best time" to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 In supporting the loan application, Councilwoman Charmayne S. Bohman said the 
arts plan would be "a wonderful upgrade for our city. This project will raise 
property values and (imposes) no tax increase or fees for the citizens of 
Westminster." 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment Director Don Anderson said the loan would be paid from HUD 
Community Development Block grants. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city can borrow up to five times its annual allocation and repay 
the loan over a period of up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 1994-95 fiscal year, the city will receive $1.2 million in Community 
Development Block grants, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency would provide $475,000 for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city would use the $1.3 million that Paragon Cable paid in 
1989 for the right to keep its franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Weddle, the cable company's public affairs director, said the money was 
paid in exchange for the city's approval to extend Paragon Cable's franchise 
until 2004 and waiving the right to buy back the cable system. 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon Cable bought the cable system five years ago from a group of cities 
that included Westminster, Weddle said.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; HOMEOWNERS LOSE POWER LINE SUIT 
</P>

<P>
 A Superior Court judge ruled Monday that the value of three luxury San 
Clemente homes have not been affected by nearby high-voltage power lines, as 
the homeowners alleged in a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge James R. Ross' decision upholds the same conclusion reached Friday by 
the majority of the members of an advisory jury: There is no correlation 
between the power lines and the diminishing values of the Mariner's Point 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs' attorney, Michael Withey, said he will appeal the decision. He 
tried to convince the jury and Ross that the homeowners should have been 
compensated for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which was heard in Superior Court in Fullerton, pits the homeowners 
against San Diego Gas & Electric Co. in a twist to the decades-old controversy 
over the purported health risks of high-voltage power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than contend the electromagnetic fields emitted by the power lines 
cause health problems, the homeowners said the power lines have destroyed their 
property values by scaring off potential buyers. Buyers, they argued, fear 
there might be a link between the power lines and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four homeowners sued in 1992, alleging the four new power lines added 
to the existing seven increased the electromagnetic emissions, hence causing 
their property values to plummet. All but six -- three couples -- dropped out 
of the lawsuit before the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross refused the plaintiffs' final request Monday to force the utility company 
to move the power lines or reconfigure them to reduce the electromagnetic 
field. The judge noted that early in the case the utility offered to 
reconfigure the power lines, but the homeowners refused. 
</P>
<P>
 SDG&E attorney Greg Barnes said that initially the company offered to 
reconfigure the lines at the homeowners' expense -- probably about $36,000 -- 
and later, in settlement talks just before the trial, offered to do the job for 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing testimony from health, real estate and physics experts, nine of 
the 12 jurors decided Friday that SDG&E's wires had not diminished the value of 
the homes. Ross saw no reason to disagree.ANDREW LePAGESAN DIEGO GAS AND

<P>
 Betsy Banyard-Florence, a drama teacher at Columbus Tustin Middle School, has 
been selected teacher of the year by the Tustin Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 She was honored for the drug and alcohol prevention videos that her students 
write and produce, including "Be Smart, Don't Start," which won first place in 
the 1993 Orange County Department of Education competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Banyard-Florence will represent the Tustin school district in the Orange 
County Teacher of the Year competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight teachers from other school districts are vying to represent the county 
in the state competition, with the winner moving on to the national level. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners are honored at the White House. The President confers the awards on 
the nation's best teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Banyard-Florence, who has worked for the school district for the past 30 
years, became a drama teacher in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, she taught physical education, art, music, home economics and 
speech at Columbus Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has no formal training in drama, Banyard-Florence has created an 
award-winning program.  
</P>
<P>
 Since 1983, her drama students have written and produced drug awareness videos 
that have been shown in schools around the district. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, her students also produced a mime show, "The Clown's Balloons," for 
students with limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is loved by her students, popular with parents and respected by her 
peers," said Supt. David Andrews. "She's a wonderful role model." 
</P>
<P>
 Banyard-Florence, who speaks fluent Spanish, also has been an ESL teacher at 
Columbus Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she has been a mentor teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Banyard-Florence holds a bachelor's degree from San Francisco State University 
and a master's degree from Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also attended Scripps College in Claremont and the University of 
Madrid in Spain. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY; WARNING GIVEN ON FORAGING ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents living on the outskirts of South County are warned by county animal 
control and health officials to watch out for an increase in animal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in late spring, many animals that are rearing their young wander near 
homes in search of food and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials suggest taking the following steps: 
</P>
<P>
 * Opossums, raccoons and skunks often make their nests under homes or in 
attics and back yards. Block off all holes that lead to crawl spaces under 
homes and decks. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, eliminate access to roofs by trimming tree branches. Clear away piles of 
wood or debris from the ground that would attract small mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Migrating ducks occasionally will take up temporary residence in a back-yard 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 County animal control officers recommend placing an inflatable beach ball into 
the pool, where winds will sweep it across the water and frighten off ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking for food to feed their pups, coyotes will raid trash cans and prey 
on small domestic pets that are allowed to run loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure trash cans are not accessible to wildlife and keep all small pets 
indoors as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Snakes, including rattlesnakes, become more active as the weather becomes 
warmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents near the foothills areas of the county should eliminate all rodents 
from their yards. Without a food source, snakes will forage elsewhere, county 
animal control officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on wildlife, call the county animal control offices at 
(714) 935-6848.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; 2 HELD IN BURGLARY OF GUITAR STORE

<P>
 Police captured two men accused of smashing into a Fountain Valley guitar 
store with their car early Monday and fleeing with $20,000 worth of musical 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Dann Bean said officers responding to a 5:11 a.m. silent burglar 
alarm at the Guitar Center, 18361 Euclid St., saw three suspects loading a car 
with guitars and amplifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The car had been used to smash through the rear doors of the store, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglars fled in the car, but abandoned the vehicle on the San Diego 
Freeway near the Euclid Street freeway on-ramp, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officers chased the suspects on foot, running across freeway lanes, and early 
commuter traffic was halted during the chase, Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the suspects, Claude Edward Smith, 33, and Edward Price, 19, both of 
Los Angeles, were arrested when they were discovered hiding in a nearby storage 
lot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified third suspect escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Price was bitten on the ankle and buttocks by a Fountain Valley Police dog 
during the chase, according to police.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Price were being held on felony charges at the Huntington Beach 
Jail, with bail set at $10,000 each, police said.FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; FAIR TO RAISE FUNDS FOR FOOTBALL TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cross-town football rivals will team up next month when players and coaches 
from three high schools sponsor a carnival aimed at raising money for their 
cash-strapped programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tri-School Fair will take place June 3-5 and is being organized by 
football teams from Irvine, Woodbridge and University high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams are fierce competitors on the field, but boosters said that all 
three need money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that all schools had the same financial needs," said University High 
parent Linda Sonnonstine. "We decided to join forces rather than do it 
separately." 
</P>
<P>
 High school football programs receive limited financial support from the 
school district, forcing boosters and the players themselves to pay for most of 
the teams' expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of one football player's expenses for one season is about $1,250, 
said John Encheff, a University High football booster. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope to raise about $20,000 during the three-day event, which will 
take place near the Civic Center off Harvard Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair will include carnival rides, food and music. Admission is $3. 
Information: (714) 854-8809. 
</P>
<P>
 Encheff and other boosters said they doubt the teams' cooperation during the 
fund-raiser will soften their actions during the big games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players (from the different schools) all go to the same places at night, 
attend the same dances," he said. "But that all stops on the football field. 
There is a lot of rivalry in the city of Irvine."SHELBY GRAD

FEW TO TAKE CLAS TESTS IN NEWPORT; EDUCATION: MORE THAN 40% OF STUDENTS FAIL TO 
RETURN PERMISSION FORMS. MANY PARENTS REFUSE TO ALLOW TESTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only about one-fifth of the eighth- and 10th-graders in the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District will take the state's controversial standardized tests 
this year, because hundreds of students did not return permission slips 
required by the district and hundreds of parents refused to let their children 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The low level of participation in the California Learning Assessment System 
means the test will offer little information about district and individual 
school performance, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't yield useful results in any case," said Barbara Anderson, director 
of instruction for Newport-Mesa Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining a handful of other districts around the state, the Newport-Mesa school 
board voted last week to require parental permission before eighth- and 
10th-grade students take the CLAS tests. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the exams, trustees said CLAS violated state law by 
questioning students about family life, sex, religion and morality without 
parental permission. Faced with a competing state law that requires the 
district to administer standardized tests, the board decided to seek parental 
permission by sending permission slips home with students. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district now will likely avoid legal challenges from either the 
state or CLAS opponents, lack of participation will render Newport-Mesa's 
results virtually useless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kids who get hurt," state Department of Education spokeswoman Susie 
Lange said about the Newport-Mesa situation. "Test results (offer) useful 
information as to how (a school's) kids perform, compared to other kids in the 
state. With that information, hopefully, that community then works to 
strengthen its curriculum and strengthen education for their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Newport-Mesa) just voted to give themselves less help in their education 
program," she said. "Who does that hurt? The kids." She noted that a Los 
Angeles judge ruled last week that parental permission is not required for the 
CLAS test.  
</P>
<P>
 Launched last year, CLAS attempts to evaluate students' critical thinking as 
well as their knowledge, and measures performance against tough statewide 
standards. About 1 million fourth-, fifth-, eighth- and 10th-graders in more 
than 7,000 schools are scheduled to take the reading, writing, math, science 
and social studies exams this spring at a cost of about $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In Newport-Mesa, elementary school students began taking the tests last week. 
Eighth- and 10th-graders who have permission will start the exams this week or 
next, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In most districts, CLAS is given in the classroom, with the handful of 
students who are not participating sent out for alternative activities. Because 
most of Newport-Mesa's upper-grade students will not be taking the tests, 
classes will continue as normal, with those participating in CLAS pulled out 
for the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 2,300 Newport-Mesa eighth- and 10th-graders eligible for the tests, only 
1,323, or 57.5%, returned the permission slips on time. Of those, the parents 
of 872 students, or 66% of those responding, did not grant permission for their 
children to take the test, leaving only 451 with permission to participate. 
Those 451 students represent less than 20% of the total number of eighth- and 
10th-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 Participation will be lowest at two of the district's four high schools. Only 
nine students, or 3% of those eligible, have permission to take CLAS at 
Estancia High; 16 students, 5% of the total, can take the exams at Newport 
Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two traditional high schools, Corona del Mar High and Costa Mesa 
High, will each have more than 30% of eligible students taking the tests. Back 
Bay, the district's alternative high school program, will have no students 
participate in CLAS. Only two Back Bay students returned the slips, and neither 
had parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
 State and local officials agreed that the low numbers were likely due to the 
difficulty in getting permission slips returned by older students and not to an 
overwhelming parental rejection of CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids don't love tests, and we were depending on kids to take the form home," 
Anderson said. "A kid could see that the easiest way out was not to bring the 
slip home to the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange agreed, saying: "If we were giving $100 away to every kid, but you had 
to get positive parental permission, we probably would get the same results. . 
. . It just doesn't happen. The slips don't get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa Supt. Mac Bernd said he hopes the board's criticism of CLAS will 
be addressed so the district can give the tests without parental permission 
slips next year.

JURY REITERATES ITS CRITICISM OF RECORDER; INVESTIGATION: REPORT SAYS MONEY TO 
UPDATE FILING SYSTEM HAS GONE UNUSED. RECORDER LEE BRANCH SAYS CONCERNS ARE 
BEING ADDRESSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reiterating claims of mismanagement in the Orange County recorder's office, a 
grand jury study has found that the office has relied on an antiquated 
hand-filing system while failing to use millions in available funds to update 
the vast record-keeping network. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent report, grand jurors said county services provided to local 
businesses and residents were delayed up to six weeks because administrators 
did not make timely improvements with $8 million held in reserve accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-page report made no mention of sexual harassment and other complaints 
made by employees against Recorder Lee A. Branch, which led to his 
unprecedented censure by the Board of Supervisors in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand jury officers could not be reached for comment Monday, but Branch said 
he expects the jury to issue a second report dealing exclusively with the 
harassment complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate county investigation completed in January found that Branch's 
office romance with and favored treatment of supervisor Nancy L. Smith created 
such a hostile work environment that nine employees sought medical treatment 
for stress and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 The January county probe also stated that there was evidence to support 
allegations that Branch had made lewd comments to a female employee and made 
sexual advances to another. In the same review, officials also criticized 
Branch's management style as "haphazard and incomplete." 
</P>
<P>
 Branch said Monday that he has provided information to the Orange County 
district attorney's office, which has been aiding the grand jury in its review 
of the harassment allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to hide," Branch said. "I hope (the second report) comes out 
before the election so it will show how baseless these complaints really are." 
</P>
<P>
 Branch, 57, has held the office since 1978 and is seeking reelection in the 
June 7 primary. The longtime recorder has said the investigation of his office 
has been part of a political "hidden agenda" to remove him from office to make 
room for a favored candidate, County Clerk Gary Granville. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent grand jury report expressed continued concern for a lack of 
equipment modernization within an office that receives and files 3,000 to 4,000 
documents a day. The documents, for the most part, relate to local real estate 
transactions, birth and death certificates and marriage licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A large amount of the filing work continues to be done by hand, the report 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although millions of dollars are being held in reserve in the Orange County 
treasurer's office, the system has not been updated and services to citizens 
and the business community continue to be delayed," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also said that no written plan exists for a technical renovation of 
office operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Branch said nearly all of the problems identified by the grand jury had 
either been resolved or were being addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch said part of the $8-million reserve fund has been used to establish 
computer terminals in the county's 26 branch libraries, where residents can get 
information about marriage licenses, birth records and death certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 The recorder said much of the money was not spent because it was unclear how 
much it was going to cost to provide more room for computer equipment to 
convert the filing process to an automated system. Branch said the additional 
space was only recently approved at a cost of nearly $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not putting the grand jury down, but we've already been doing some of 
these things," Branch said. "I am glad to cooperate with them."

2 CONVICTED OF MURDER IN ANAHEIM CARJACKING; CRIME: THE JURY FAILED TO REACH A 
VERDICT ON THE MURDER CHARGE AGAINST A THIRD DEFENDANT BUT DID CONVICT HIM OF 
KIDNAPING.

 In what was one of Orange County's first carjacking cases, jurors on Monday 
convicted three men for their roles in the murder of an Anaheim college student 
whose body was found in the trunk of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors convicted Shawn Burney, 20, of Tustin and Allen Dean Burnett, 20, of 
Anaheim of first-degree murder, kidnaping and robbery and additional 
allegations in the murder of 23-year-old Joseph Andrew Kondrath. 
</P>
<P>
 Burney could face the death penalty. He was the only one of the three 
defendants that prosecutors were seeking capital punishment against. They have 
said they believe he was the triggerman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Superior Court jury also convicted Scott Rembert, 22, of 
Anaheim of kidnaping but failed to reach verdicts on the remaining counts, 
including robbery, murder and special circumstances that mandate a life 
sentence without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Kondrath was last seen leaving for work at 4 a.m. on June 10, 1992. He was 
grabbed from behind the wheel of his car in front of his home, robbed and shot 
in the head. His body was found in the trunk of his car, abandoned in the 2000 
block of West Crescent Avenue, a short distance from his home. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder took place shortly before the word carjacking began appearing in 
headlines and widespread attention was given to such crimes that rattled the 
nerves of motorists nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe Kondrath was murdered to eliminate him as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald set a June 10 hearing to determine whether Rembert 
will be retried. Burnett faces life in prison without parole when he is 
sentenced July 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David Brent and defense attorneys declined to discuss the 
case. Jurors, many of whom appeared distraught while announcing the verdicts, 
also have been barred from talking about the case until the death-penalty phase 
is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony in the death-penalty portion of the case begins Wednesday.

ORANGE SUES OVER INMATES HOUSED AT LACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Keeping a promise made only days earlier, Orange city officials have filed a 
lawsuit seeking to block Sheriff Brad Gates from housing maximum-security 
prisoners at Theo Lacy Branch Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court, claims the 
sheriff's move last month to house maximum-security inmates at Theo Lacy 
violates state law, a court order and action by the Board of Supervisors.They 
also claim housing dangerous criminals at the jail could endanger neighbors, 
including homeowners and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange City Council unanimously voted to initiate the legal action last 
Tuesday, saying they believe the city is being "trampled on by the sheriff." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing overcrowding in its main jail in Santa Ana, the Sheriff's Department in 
April transferred 48 maximum-security prisoners to the 1,326-bed facility, 
which typically houses medium- and minimum-security prisoners. If not for the 
transfer, sheriff's officials said, they would have been forced to release 
criminals well before their sentences were set to end. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials also have said the sheriff has the legal authority over 
operations of the county jail system and was within full legal rights in 
transferring the maximum-security inmates to the Orange facility. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Orange has gone to court over the jail. In 1993, 
the city lost a costly two-year fight with the county when it tried to prevent 
an increase in Theo Lacy's jail population.

FIXATIONS: ENVELOPING OBSESSION; GENE FREEMAN OF SANTA ANA HAS SPENT FIVE YEARS 
RESEARCHING AND WRITING THE HISTORY OF ENVELOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of my lingering fears in this job -- aside from the thought of ever having 
to share a bed with 25 ventriloquist dummies again -- is that someone might 
really put me on sometime. There I'd be, nodding earnestly as a Fixations 
subject was going on about his collection of toast -- "Now, look at all the 
raisins in this 1923 slice!" -- or devotion to Freddie Prinze, and the whole 
time he'd be making it up on the spot and laughing up his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 I had to wonder for a while if this weren't the case last week when I was 
talking with Gene Freeman. Though the 63-year-old retired aerospace project 
manager already has a track record for extremes -- he has a rare book 
collection that's heavy on Longfellow, with some 80 copies of "Hiawatha" alone 
-- it was a mite hard to accept the idea that he's devoted a goodsome chunk of 
the past five years to writing a history of envelopes . He's only three-fourths 
of the way through, by the way, and estimates it will weigh in at around 300 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I'm limiting myself, but I haven't devoted any more thought to envelopes 
in my life than I have to, say, gravel or pockets or any of a great number of 
other items that so readily lend themselves to being taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman, though, has been pushing the envelope, making scholarly searches 
through obscure books, trade publications, census and patent records and a maze 
of microfilm to fill in the not surprisingly huge gaps in mankind's existing 
knowledge of the humble envelope. 
</P>
<P>
 It helps considerably in establishing Freeman's credibility, perhaps even his 
sanity, that the envelopes which first attracted his interest were not the 
blank bland things we know today. Rather, five years ago a Fullerton book 
dealer friend got him interested in Civil War-era envelopes, which were 
decorated with colorful patriotic art and political cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealer had wanted Freeman, who was then recovering from a surgery, to 
spend his down time writing a monograph on the envelopes. The intent was to 
publish a short volume that would include -- as leaf books do with pages of 
rare books -- an old envelope in each. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a little carried away and didn't write a short enough thing for him to 
be able to afford printing it," Freeman said. "I went beyond the Civil War to 
give background of how they were manufactured, then a chapter on the sorts of 
presses used to make them." 
</P>
<P>
 He drew some of his inspiration to pursue the esoteric subject from Henry 
Petroski's book "The Pencil, A History of Design and Circumstance." It is a 
tour de force on its skinny subject, ranging from the engineering aspects of 
the pencil to ruminations on Henry David Thoreau's day job as a pencil maker. 
"You'll never feel the same about the pencil after you read this terrific 
book!" promises Larry King on its cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very good book, though it hasn't changed my feelings about the 
pencil," said Freeman, who prefers a computer. The book did show him it's 
possible to write engagingly on a seemingly limited subject, though he fears 
there was no one as interesting as Thoreau in the envelope trade. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jeff. Davis boasts that 'Cotton's King,'  
</P>
<P>
 Upon his throne so rotten,  
</P>
<P>
 Soon he'll find amid his swing,  
</P>
<P>
 that hemp is king of cotton.  
</P>
<P>
 So rhymes the poem gracing one wartime envelope, accompanying an illustration 
of a noose of Northern hemp awaiting the Confederate president. There are many 
similar sleeves in Freeman's collection: Davis in the noose; Davis as a 
skeleton; one clever illustration of him captioned "Jeff Davis going to war," 
which inverted instead looks like a donkey head, captioned "Jeff Davis 
returning from war." Another envelope depicts Satan, titled "The First 
Secessionist." Propaganda is eternal.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think many of them would win prizes," says Freeman, who has a dry 
humor more suggestive of Texas than his Louisiana birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 These envelopes were a fad during the war, so much so that the market was 
saturated with them by 1862 (There were Southern-leaning counterparts as well). 
Most people bought them not to post but to save, as trading cards are today. 
Envelopes and postage stamps came into common use around the same time, and 
many then felt it was the former that would become collectors' items over time. 
 
</P>
<P>
 When was the first envelope made? Others, says Freeman, have tried and failed 
to answer that question, and he's not certain he'll be able to either. There 
also is a question of definition. In the past, some that could afford it would 
simply wrap their letters in another sheet of paper, which would be called an 
envelope. Others would hand-fold and glue paper in a fashion that resembled the 
modern envelope. Freeman has traced this practice back to 1694, and cites a 
German king having used one in 1712. 
</P>
<P>
 The manufactured envelope didn't come to the fore, though, until the 1840s, 
when changes in postal rates in England and the United States made them 
practicable. Before 1840 in England and 1845 here, mail was charged by the 
piece, and an envelope was considered a separate piece. That would not only 
double the cost of sending a letter, but, over distance, would cause an 
exponential increase, so that an enveloped letter might cost 10 times as much 
to send. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, the old-fashioned method of sealing a letter had involved a wafer 
(a mucilage product that replaced sealing wax) that might have the heft of a 
clay cookie. "It's funny that they charged letters by the piece, but they would 
accept clunky seals like that as part of the letter. In large quantities that 
would clearly be a disadvantage to the guy who had to carry them," Freeman 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said bureaucrats in both England and the United States resisted changing 
the system, predicting dire consequences. Instead, the changes spurred an 
entrepreneurial rush. "The 1860 (U.S.) Census here claimed some 18 companies to 
be solely manufacturing envelopes, which is a pretty big jump from 1845, when 
it was zero. In Britain they went from nobody using them to nearly everybody in 
six years, and it was close to that here. That's growth about as fast as 
Nintendo or anyone else has managed." 
</P>
<P>
 He has given a lot of thought to trying to figure why there was such a ready 
demand for the new item. "If anything, there had been a resistance to them. 
I've found letters from the time saying, 'I don't want to use an envelope 
because I don't believe in sending people my spit.' And I have courtesy 
(manners) books saying you shouldn't use envelopes except for certain things, 
and that for social correspondence, you should fold and seal your letter like a 
lady. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some snobbish resistance, but I think it was a snobbish demand that 
created the rush. Most of the early use of envelopes was by ladies with the 
money to use them. And when society uses things, I think the masses tend to 
pick them up too if they can afford it. That's speculative, but there's really 
no other accounting for the rapid demand for them," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Along with the full-time manufacturers, a great many small job printers -- the 
precursors of today's Sir Speedy-style shops -- made envelopes. Freeman has 
created spread sheets listing more than 350 Civil War-era makers, and one by 
one, he's been tracking them down. Some don't appear in any city records, and 
Freeman suspects they may never have existed, instead being the recent 
inventions of rare-envelope forgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with such frauds, he finds what little existing history there is to be 
fraught with inaccuracy. The common source for their information is an envelope 
manufacturer's trade publication, the Red Envelope, published from 1915 to 
1925. The Apollo bookstore in Costa Mesa turned up an original set of these 
magazines for Freeman, and he finds them well-intentioned but packed with 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Freeman's diligence has turned up an ad for pre-gummed adhesive 
security envelopes "capable of being securely fastened without wax or wafers" 
in the New York Mercantile Registry of 1848.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's 10 years before this reference says they were first made," Freeman 
said. "So it's really not a very accurate history, but unfortunately it's the 
only one, and everyone has used it as a reference, making a big perpetuation of 
these inaccuracies." 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, Gene, it looks like you're really going to shatter some myths here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, to the seven or eight people interested in it," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When completed he thinks the book has a fair chance of being published by the 
University of Virginia Press, since it has made a specialty of Civil War 
studies and the university has a school of printing arts. He thinks his book 
will be the first to have much information on the job printers in the envelope 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meanwhile, Freeman averages a day a week in his studies, poring over 
microfilm or old texts at the L.A. main Public Library or the Huntington 
Library, corresponding with the British Museum and other far-flung sources or 
digging into the rare books that fill the shelves of his home. 
</P>
<P>
 In one place he might find an anecdotal claim of an envelope being patented in 
Sardinia in 1823, in another an account of a U.S. postal auditor noting in 1842 
that, "Pockets, which are the same as envelopes, are now coming into use." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately he's been spending more time poring over old census records tracking 
down those 350 Civil War envelope makers. "It's very tedious work, nothing 
pleasant about it, trying to run down all this information," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He's says he hopes his own book will be more bearable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to sneak a little humor in, but it's very hard not to be excessively 
boring when you're writing trade histories. Most of my writing has been in the 
aerospace industry, and that has been as dispassionate and dull as you can get, 
straight technical writing." 
</P>
<P>
 He anticipates the book will be finished this year. Some folks go into a mood 
slump when they finally complete a long project, but Freeman isn't allowing any 
time for that. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm going to do a book on the history of dictionaries. I've written a 
bunch of chapters already. And that's almost impossible to make interesting. 
I'm really trying to find a way to make it something that won't be massively 
dull."

BRIT CRACKDOWN ON 'VIDEO NASTIES'; REGULATIONS TRY TO CURB FILMS DEEMED HARMFUL 
TO KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new film from the producers of the award-winning "Leon the Pig Farmer" 
appears to be the first casualty of the British government's move to impose 
tougher censorship regulations on the nation's $1.75-billion video industry, 
the world's second-largest after the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beyond Bedlam," described by its makers as a "tongue-in-cheek, action-horror 
film" has been denied video certification, meaning it cannot be released on 
video in the U.K. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implications for the industry are horrendous," says "Bedlam" producer 
Paul Brooks. "It's just insane." 
</P>
<P>
 Reluctantly bending to public and political pressures, the government recently 
announced it will crack down on so-called "video nasties" -- videos containing 
violence or other images that could be harmful to children. But vague wording 
of the proposed regulations have thrown the video industry into confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a number of films, including the critically acclaimed "Reservoir 
Dogs," are waiting in limbo while officials decide whether they are suitable 
for video release. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulations are considered unnecessary by many in Britain, which 
already has the strictest film and video censorship laws in the Western world. 
And videos undergo tougher censorship than films in the U.K. because they are 
considered more likely to be seen by children. A number of movies -- including 
"The Exorcist" -- have never been certified for video release in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite their own public pronouncements that the existing regulations are 
strong enough, government officials are making them tougher anyway as an 
apparent matter of political expediency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Video nasties," as the British call them, have remained a hot-button issue 
since last November's trial of two 11-year-old boys who kidnaped and murdered 
toddler James Bulger. At the end of the trial, the presiding judge wondered 
aloud whether watching violent videos may have prompted the boys' actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police and prosecutors stated that violent videos played no role in 
the case, the judge's comments unleashed a torrent of stories in the tabloid 
press calling for stronger laws against violent and sexually explicit tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Democrat MP David Alton then proposed an amendment to a criminal 
justice bill, currently wending its way through Parliament, that sought to ban 
the sale or rental of all videos that "present an inappropriate model for 
children or are likely to cause psychological harm to children." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, every film, no matter what its rating or intended audience, 
would have to be suitable for children to obtain certification for video 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were absolutely appalled," says Lavinia Carey, director general of the 
British Video Assn., which represents distributors and rights-holders in the 
U.K., including the Hollywood studios. "It was a ludicrous piece of 
legislation. It would effectively mean the whole video industry would be 
destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of the videos rented in Britain are rated "15" (meaning they should 
not be shown to anyone under age 15) or "18" (not for view to those under 18) 
and most, if not all of them, would be banned under Alton's proposal, she said. 
The rest of the videos rented in Britain are rated for view by all age groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the head of the British Board of Film Classification -- the censorship 
office -- complained that the measure would outlaw award-winning films such as 
"Schindler's List" and "Dances With Wolves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Conservative government opposed the idea, calling it unworkable and 
unenforceable. But when 80 Conservative MPs said they would support Alton's 
amendment, government ministers quickly came back with their own proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government was going to be defeated, so they panicked and reached a 
compromise," says Carey. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the government's plan, retailers renting or selling videos rated "18" to 
minors will face up to six months in jail, while those renting or selling 
videos that have not been given any classification -- and are therefore illegal 
-- will face up to two years imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 That seems clear enough. But what is causing confusion are the proposed new 
guidelines under which the censorship board is to classify and certify videos. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're telling the BBFC," says a spokesman at the government Home Office, 
which handles domestic affairs, "is to consider the psychological effect of 
videos on children." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what that means and how it will be interpreted is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 James Ferman, chairman of the British Board of Film Classification, did not 
return calls from The Times seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Carey of the British Video Assn., "We feel we'll survive this with no 
noticeable effect on the industry." But she predicts that more films will have 
to undergo censorships cuts, more will be given a higher rating classification 
than they would have previously and that a greater number of films will be 
denied video certification. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the government's proposal is part of a larger criminal justice bill 
that is still under consideration in Parliament, and therefore has not gone 
into effect, the film censorship board may already be applying the new 
regulations preemptively. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the feeling of "Beyond Bedlam" producer Brooks. He said he 
originally was told by the BBFC that his film was being granted certification. 
But after a tabloid newspaper ran an article citing three graphic scenes in his 
film -- which has just been released in British theaters -- the BBFC announced 
it was denying it a video certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenes cited by the tabloid involved a dream sequence of a young man 
making love with an elderly woman, a syringe injected into an open wound and a 
big fight at the end of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks says the film is a parody of American horror films and features 
"comic-strip violence -- Tom and Jerry violence. The film is nowhere near a 
video nasty. It's a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we were passed uncut previously does suggest political and 
tabloid hysteria. It's repressive censorship if it continues."

LIBERTY, EQUALITY AND PURSUIT OF BALANCE; TELEVISION: 'DECLARATIONS', WHICH 
PREMIERES TONIGHT ON PBS, IS THE FIRST SERIES FROM ITVS, AN INDEPENDENT SERVICE 
BORN FROM A BATTLE WITH PUBLIC TV'S UPPER ECHELONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With "Declarations" -- a three-part series on a trilogy of American ideals 
encompassed in the Declaration of Independence -- the relatively new and rather 
long-awaited Independent Television Service declares its arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning tonight on PBS and continuing over the next two Tuesdays, 
"Declarations" explores issues of liberty, equality and the pursuit of 
happiness. It is the Independent Service's first series, though a dozen other 
programs have aired since last June. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the producers toyed with the idea of calling the series "Declaration 
of Independents." Which might have been appropriate, given that ITVS -- as the 
independent, federally funded organization calls itself in the alphabet-soup 
world of public TV -- grew out of a decade-long battle between independent 
producers and the upper echelons at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and 
PBS over who and what got funded for production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Through the Telecommunications Act of 1988, Congress mandated that CPB set up 
a mechanism to give money directly to independent producers, bypassing the PBS 
hierarchy, asserting that it is "in the public interest to encourage the 
development of programming that involves creative risks and that addresses the 
needs of unserved and underserved audiences, particularly children and 
minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes "Declarations: Essays on American Ideals," the $1.2-million showcase 
project, containing such a profusion of voices and viewpoints through personal 
essays, "soapbox" commentaries and on-the-street or playground interviews -- 
children are included too -- that at times it's a cacophony. There are 
liberals, conservatives, rich, poor, representatives of every racial and 
religious background as well as anti-religionists, gays, straights -- and, in 
the end, no prevailing point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 According to executive producer Richard O'Regan, who heads Claypoint 
Productions in New York, such balance was deliberate. Indeed, he said, " 
'Balance' was written into our contract -- as balanced as you can get with a 
finite group of people." 
</P>
<P>
 "We made it an absolute commitment that we would create a forum in which ideas 
from all over the political spectrum would be listened to and respected," said 
O'Regan, who worked at ABC News from 1977 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 It has taken nearly six years for ITVS, based in St. Paul, Minn., to begin 
presenting a steady flow of programming, primarily because, even after it was 
formed, battles continued with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the 
independent federal agency that helps fund public TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The odyssey began with a nine-month wrangle between the National Coalition of 
Independent Public Broadcasting Producers, which had fought for the independent 
service, and CPB over who belonged on the ITVS board. That ended in September, 
1989. It wasn't until June, 1991, that CPB signed the key operating and 
production agreements with ITVS. In December, 1991 -- a year after its first 
solicitation of 24,000 independent producers resulted in 2,043 proposals from 
47 states and territories -- ITVS awarded its first $3 million in grants to 26 
program projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1992, some Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), questioned whether ITVS and its $8 
million-a-year budget ought to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a good deal of your institutional energies are focused on the political 
arena that relates to your existence, then the ship isn't really moving 
forward," said John Schott, ITVS' first executive director (1990-1993) and 
former producer of "Alive From Off Center." "I spent a good deal of time in 
Washington answering questions, providing information and education for people 
who didn't really understand what we were."  
</P>
<P>
 "I think Dole saw us as the weak link in PBS' chain," said Lawrence Daressa, 
co-director of the independent producers' coalition and board member of ITVS. 
"Basically he decided to eliminate ITVS from public television's authorization 
because of various programs we had funded" -- including a documentary that 
Marlon Riggs was working on at the time of his death in April, "Black Is, Black 
Ain't," about African American identity. For conservatives, Riggs was a 
touchstone of controversy because of "Tongues Untied," his 1989 
autobiographical study of gay black sexuality, which aired on PBS' "P.O.V." 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Other senators got on the bandwagon against ITVS, noted Daressa, but through 
the help of Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), "we were able to beat that back." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the balance in "Declarations," which was commissioned on his 
watch, had anything to do with politics, Schott responded: "I think it ought to 
be something that ITVS stands for in any case, and does. . . . Indeed, there 
are many points on the compass, whether they're cultural or racial or 
ideological." 
</P>
<P>
 ITVS got its first program on the air last June -- "Greetings From Out Here," 
a road trip movie by Ellen Spiro, a lesbian filmmaker who went back home to the 
South to see how gays were living. It ran on 102 of nearly 350 public-TV 
stations, and is being re-offered for broadcast next month. Since then, 11 more 
programs have aired, including, most recently, "Anatomy of a Springroll," in 
which filmmaker Paul Kwan attempts to reconcile his youth in Vietnam with his 
life today in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 James T. Yee, former executive director of the National Asian American 
Telecommunications Assn., who succeeded Schott last summer as executive 
director of ITVS, says the challenge now is convincing the full roster of PBS 
stations "to consider our programming (for broadcast). It's a slow, 
trust-building relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "Declarations," ITVS has funded 59 other individual programs and five 
series that are either awaiting scheduling or are still in production. One of 
the series, "TV Families," is a five-hour dramatic series dealing with ways 
that TV reflects and defines the notion of "family." 
</P>
<P>
 But now that ITVS is rolling along, some independent producers worry that it 
might fall into the same trap that it charged PBS itself with -- playing it 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Williams, a Los Angeles black filmmaker ("In Search of Our Fathers" on 
PBS' "Frontline") who was one of the 15 principal producers on "Declarations," 
said he was "frustrated by the process." He notes that there's some buzz in the 
independent producer community as to what ITVS stands for. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that ITVS is serving two masters," said Williams. "One is 
PBS/CPB and the other is the independent film community. They want to get on 
PBS, and PBS hasn't put many of their shows on. So hence, 'Declarations' is 
trying to appeal to this sense of not being so controversial." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Declarations: Essays on American Ideals" premieres tonight at 9 on KVCR-TV 
Channel 24 and at 10:30 on KCET-TV Channel 28.

DENISE CROSBY TREKS TO STAGE CENTER; BING'S GRANDDAUGHTER LEAVES THE FINAL 
FRONTIER FOR OTHER ACTING CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE K. SCHENDEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no surprise to those who know Denise Crosby that she would jump ship 
after one year on "Star Trek: The Next Generation" because her part wasn't 
challenging enough. Or that in March she took on the role of a strong, 
confident lesbian in the Equity-waiver production of "Last Summer at Bluefish 
Cove" because "it's a greeaat part." 
</P>
<P>
 Her "Next Generation" character, Lt. Tasha Yar, was killed off at her request, 
although Crosby later reappeared several times in time travel or dream 
sequences -- and she returns to the show for its finale Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was so great to see a woman take the job traditionally held by a man," she 
says, referring to her role as chief of security. "But I couldn't see doing 
that for six years." 
</P>
<P>
 But she can see herself continuing on with "Bluefish Cove," which completed 
its run at Theatre Geo under the direction of Dorothy Lyman and will begin an 
extended run at the Tiffany Theater next Wednesday through mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 "This play has inspired me," Crosby says. "It revived me in a way . . . 
reminding me why I became an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 And acting is what she's doing these days. Crosby is in Vancouver this week 
filming "Dream Man" with Andrew McCarthy. She just completed a segment of 
Showtime's "Red Shoe Diaries." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hold on," Crosby says as she drops the phone to grab a newspaper. "I love 
this quote." 
</P>
<P>
 She reads a quote from the painter Degas: "It is wonderful to be famous as 
long as you're unknown."  
</P>
<P>
 Crosby can relate, she says, because as an actor, she needs to observe other 
people. But when you're a recognizable person, "You can't just watch somebody 
at the checkout stand." But on the other hand -- as she reads the card attached 
to a dozen roses sent by a fan she just met on a Vancouver street -- she admits 
fame has its moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Crosby comes from a family that has known a bit of fame -- Bing Crosby 
was her grandfather -- she says she was a generation removed from the "kids of 
famous people" curse. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-eyed and blond-haired, Crosby grew up in Hollywood and spent time at 
Paramount Studios (where her mother worked as a production accountant), but 
didn't think about being an actress. Her mother married her stepfather when 
Crosby was 6, and she didn't get to know her grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about that often," she says. "As I a child, I thought it was up to 
him as the adult (to make a move). As I got older, I realized that he couldn't 
do it. But I could." But by then it was too late, Bing Crosby died while his 
granddaughter was still in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never had a relationship with any of his 20 grandkids -- and he has a 
pretty great group of grandkids."  
</P>
<P>
 Crosby attempts to be analytical rather than sentimental -- which is a lot 
like Lil, her character in "Bluefish Cove." She describes the play -- which had 
great success in the early '80s with Jean Smart in the lead role of Lil -- as a 
play "about commitment, love and about friendship." Lil is confident and 
independent, and at one point states: "I know who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Since going through a period in her 20s when she felt she "had something to 
prove," Crosby says she can identify with Lil, and now at least feels closer to 
knowing who she is.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredible piece of writing," she says of the play by Jane Chambers.  
</P>
<P>
 Executive producer Judy Miller, who produced the hit play in 1983 and has 
owned the film rights for 11 years, revived it because she believes the time is 
right for a movie version of the women of Bluefish Cove. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny, it's touching. . . . I wish I'd written it," Miller says 
laughing, "but at least I found it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says that Crosby came into the role hearing "nobody could do it like 
Jean."  
</P>
<P>
 "But Denise does a fabulous job." 
</P>
<P>
 And after she departs "Bluefish Cove"? Crosby, who also starred in "Tamara" on 
stage and "Pet Sematary" on film, says she would like to direct. As an actress, 
she points to the careers of Vanessa Redgrave and Jane Fonda as role models.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to play fascinating women," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove" plays at the Tiffany Theatre, 8532 Sunset 
Blvd., West Hollywood, through July 10. Tickets are $22-$26; (310) 289-2999. 
The two-hour finale of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" airs Monday at 8 p.m. 
on KCOP Channel 13.

WHY 'BEING HUMAN' MISFIRED; MOVIES: DESPITE HAVING ROBIN WILLIAMS IN THE LEAD, 
THE MOVIE IS IN TROUBLE, IN PART BECAUSE OF LOW AUDIENCE AWARENESS AND A 
DIFFICULT STORY LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As an aging nanny in drag, Robin Williams catapulted the movie "Mrs. 
Doubtfire" into a runaway hit for 20th Century Fox, which recently released the 
popular comedy on videocassette. Meanwhile, Warner Bros. this month opened its 
own Robin Williams movie, "Being Human," but to wildly different results. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Mrs. Doubtfire" has grossed $400 million worldwide at the box office, 
and is expected to be a hit at video stores, "Being Human" will likely wind up 
in the dust bin of good intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies a tale. Or, as the female narrator of "Being Human" might 
have put it: Therein lies a story of a story. But what's in a story? "In the 
end, isn't every story all the one story?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 So, just what is the story with this movie? 
</P>
<P>
 "Being Human" opened May 6 in limited release (on 224 screens) to $764,011 
with very little audience awareness. Over this past weekend, the movie 
plummeted 64% at the box office to only $278,326 and will quickly disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the movie's pedigree -- written and directed by Scottish filmmaker 
Bill Forsyth ("Local Hero"), produced by David Puttnam ("Chariots of Fire," 
"The Killing Fields") and Robert F. Colesberry ("Mississippi Burning") and 
headlined by one of the industry's biggest stars -- "Being Human" simply failed 
to catch on with audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 It even had the marketing power of Warner Bros. behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 But tracking polls by National Research Group last week showed that "Being 
Human" was in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 43% of test audiences were aware of the film during its second week in 
release (60%-65% is considered average), while a scant 1% of audiences of all 
ages listed it as their first choice of a movie to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need a minimum of 8% to 10% (in the first-choice category) to open a 
picture," said one studio distribution executive who routinely evaluates such 
tracking scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Awareness has to do mostly with spending (on advertising)," he explained. 
"When you see a low awareness score, it's for one of three reasons. One reason 
is that it's going out in limited release and tracking is done in 16 cities and 
maybe there is no spending in those cities yet. The second reason is a lot of 
money isn't being spent to make you aware of it. The third reason is whatever 
is being spent, isn't sticking." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the movie is about a man (Williams) searching for his place in the 
world, it was a difficult concept to get across. Print ads showed Williams 
standing on a beach with an odd smile on his face looking skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 Even had Warners opted to target the film for a specific audience, it may not 
have worked. Only 2% of males over 25 said it was their first choice of a film 
to watch this weekend while 1% of males and females under 25 said it was their 
first choice. Teens between the ages of 12 and 17 gave it a dismal 30% 
awareness rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Women over 25 gave it a higher awareness rating (56%) than audiences in 
general, but that still wasn't very good. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, said a studio marketing source, people just didn't like what 
they saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people don't like it, they tell you," he said. "If they don't like it, the 
rest of the world usually doesn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, Williams plays five different characters, from cave-dwelling 
hunter-gatherer, to unlucky slave in the Roman empire, to medieval traveler, to 
survivor of a Portuguese shipwreck, and finally to an apartment-dwelling 
junk-food consumer in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of critics panned the movie. One found it wistful and charming, and 
observed that the cynical movie audience might rather want to watch a car 
crash, a massacre, a sexy bedroom tryst, or a "Mrs. Doubtfire." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, warned audiences that if they came expecting a zany Robin 
Williams, they would leave mystified and disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 1992 comedy "Toys" was both a critical as well as box-office 
disaster, audiences rediscovered his comedic talents as the genie in last 
year's animated Disney movie "Aladdin" and then again in "Mrs. Doubtfire." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' odyssey continues.

 The Mark Taper Forum co-produced three of the four productions nominated for 
best play in this year's Tony Award competition. Nominations for the annual 
Broadway awards were announced in New York Monday.

<P>
 "Angels in America: Perestroika," "The Kentucky Cycle" and "Twilight: Los
