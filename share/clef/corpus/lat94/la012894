SHE SAID, HE SAID / ANN CONWAY AND PATRICK MOTT: GUESTS CAN'T UPSTAGE

 "J oin us as we commit our love for eternity . . ." says the wedding 
invitation. We're ecstatic at the prospect of watching our pals tie the knot. 
Then we hit the I'm-heading-for-a-wedding blues. What to wear this time, we 
wonder? Something trendy or classic? Chic or romantic? High style or low-key? 
We take a look at the challenge of it all . . .  
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I got a big surprise when I attended a wedding recently and saw that a 
pal was wearing a deep-rose ensemble that perfectly harmonized with the 
bridesmaids' burgundy gowns. Beautiful color, I commented. Such luck! 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't luck, she said. She called the mother of the bride and asked about 
the color scheme of the nuptials. Such nerve! 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, I think the bride deserves "wedding-theme privacy." It's her 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other, my friend looked absolutely fabulous at the reception. The decor 
looked like it was created just for her. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: It's pretty much graven in stone, I'd think, that you're not supposed to 
upstage the bride. Quite right; it's her show. Which means, by extension, that 
the Male Spear Carrier Rule kicks in in spades. For you guys who have forgotten 
what that means, or who actually read GQ for fashion tips, or who are Fabio, 
the rule reads like this: "At formal or dressy events, men are background." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it, weddings are not guy events. The groom is a distant second 
fiddle, the guys propping him up might as well be invisible, and the men in the 
pews are there to fetch champagne for the women, smile and nod, and do the 
driving. They are, in a word, scenery. They should dress accordingly: proper, 
clean, understated. No silly accessories. No peacock stuff. Those are the 
basics. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I've always gone by the rule of dressing simply so as not to compete with 
the bride (as if anybody could). The tricky part, I think, is wearing an 
ensemble that is suitable for the church and the reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Evening weddings are a special challenge. I attended one last year in Beverly 
Hills where the vows took place in a cute little white church. I felt 
overdressed in my ribbon-trimmed black suit with gold flower buttons. (I was 
feeling a little weird in black, period. But -- such luck! -- the wedding theme 
turned out to be black and white.) I felt great at the reception, though. The 
suit, which has a flared skirt, was ideal for dancing. And the simple jacket 
looked classic, even with dressy buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: In response to an approaching summer wedding a few years ago, I bought an 
item that all guys ought to have in their closets: an undyed raw silk sport 
coat. That and a pair of darker tan slacks and maybe even a light-colored vest 
make up your warm-weather wedding uniform. It also doubles as a spiffy cruise 
suit and, if you're going to the Kentucky Derby, it'll help you blend right in 
with all the Kentucky colonels in their white linen. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from that, raw silk wears like iron, and you can get the wrinkles out by 
hanging it in the bathroom while you shower. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Men have it made. Toss on the shoes, socks, trousers, belt, shirt, tie, 
jacket, and they're out the door. For women it's step into hose, undergarments 
that match the outer garments, a dress or suit, gloves, shoes, hand bag, 
jewelry, fragrance, makeup and a hairdo. And God forbid if we forget the 
Kleenex, camera or Tylenol. 
</P>
<P>
 I love it when couples take the time to dress in harmony for a wedding. If I'm 
in a shocking-pink dress, for example, leave the brown suit on the hanger. 
Forget the sun-yellow tie. Wear the charcoal suit with the claret tie and we'll 
take the cake! 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Well, gosh, wanna trade roles? You blend into the wallpaper and bring me 
more rumaki, and I'll wear the scarlet brocade double-breasted vest with the 
gold watch chain and the gardenia in the lapel and the two-tone Italian shoes 
and hey . . . maybe a really brightly colored hat! 
</P>
<P>
 Gimme a break. If women couldn't trot out their gaudiest stuff at weddings 
there'd be riots in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, about this dressing as a couple business: how much time do couples spend 
together at weddings, anyway? Damn little, methinks. She's commiserating with 
the bride and the bride's mom and the bridesmaids, high-fiving, sharing the big 
triumph, and the guys are together somewhere else, nostalgically recalling 
their own weddings, ferreting out the Heineken and talking about cars. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: We sit together in the church, don't forget. And if we have any manners 
at all, we'll stand together in the reception line and sit by each other at 
dinner. And what about when we dance? Or when I scrape you off the floor after 
you've downed all those brewskies? 
</P>
<P>
 And forget the rumaki. I loathe liver. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Only one brewski. I'm driving, remember? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't mind dressing in a slightly complementary way, but I draw the line if 
we start to look like Barbie and Ken. I don't want a bunch of maiden aunts 
coming up to us and pinching our cheeks and gushing, "Aren't the two of you 
just the cutest things!"  
</P>
<P>
 Remember, I'm background, you're foreground. You wear the bright stuff, I wear 
the raw silk jacket. You go dark and dramatic, I wear the navy pin stripes. You 
wear a space suit, I stay home. Simple.

 Wedding bands crafted of two metals are fast replacing plain gold bands among 
engaged couples. The hottest choice is the combination of white platinum and 
yellow 18-karat gold, notes Erin Oates, spokeswoman for the Newport Beach-based 
Platinum Guild International. "It's a different, more versatile look that fits 
'90s sensibilities. With platinum, the cost is a little more, but the value 
lies with its strength and durability." Couples are opting most for a brushed, 
matte finish, she adds. Usher in Color

 It's no longer up to bridesmaids to brighten a wedding. Groomsmen can suit up 
in primaries with Lord West's Color Works collection. "An injection of color 
makes for a festive look in the spring and summer," notes Bernie Toll, a 
spokesman for the formal-wear label. "But select one (color). We don't advocate 
a rainbow wedding -- that goes back to the '50s and '60s when parties looked 
like a package of Lifesavers." As for the groom, Toll suggests the elegance of 
cream, ivory or black. For Marital Bliss 
</P>
<P>
 The thrill of getting married: Endless hours spent finding the right florist, 
makeup artist, caterer, musician, photographer and videographer, and dealing 
with everything from invitations to limousines. It's enough to push a couple 
into eloping. Enter Carolyn Campbell and Linda Patterson, who founded in 1990 
Thee Wedding Library, a one-stop, 3,000-square-foot bridal resource in Orange 
that offers free referrals to fill every need imaginable. Each vendor is 
screened, has 10 references and most have at least five years' experience. "We 
accommodate brides who need hand-held guidance and those who prefer to shop the 
library on their own," says Campbell. Filled with Memories

 A piece of lace from Grandmother's gown or a button from Mom's can add to a 
unique Victorian bridal purse (about $136) by Donnalynne Shaw. The 
Massachusetts designer, who began collecting buttons at age 3, uses antique 
fabrics and notions as well as silk flowers to custom create hair ornaments, 
shoe clips, cuffs and more. "There's a lot of memory pulled into one item," she 
says. Her drawstring pouches are also made for bridesmaids (about $76). ROSE

DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT: COAST TO COAST, JANELL BERTE GOES THE DISTANCE FOR HER 
GOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As if the 12-hour workdays designer Janell Berte averages in her Costa Mesa 
studio were not enough, she won't have a weekend to herself for the next four 
months as she travels the country presenting trunk shows of her latest 
collection of gowns for brides. But the 36-year-old designer takes the frenetic 
workload in stride, saying she finds pleasure in sharing her work with 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no better salesperson than the designer," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her gowns, which can cost between $800 and $3,500, are sold in 62 stores 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridal line is 40% of her business, with bridesmaid dresses, debutante 
dresses, formals and special orders accounting for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Berte was among the pioneers to bring Lycra into bridal wear, a fabric that 
she predicts will revolutionize the bridal industry in coming seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more form-fitting and allows for more mobility," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Brides have a practical need -- comfort -- and Berte obliges them with the 
soft fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young women are no longer so fussy with their clothes," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular use of Lycra is in mesh covering arms, decolletage and 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not itchy or as sheer as tulle," she says. "It's sexy, but in a modest 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 The simplicity and fit of Lycra also fall into current tastes for gowns that 
are streamlined, tailored and free of froufrou. 
</P>
<P>
 Berte gowns don't drip with opulent details, but they are not plain. Romantic 
details are created with the same fabric as the dress for a subtlety that 
focuses attention on the wearer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so sick of fringe and sequins," Berte says. "My gowns don't have any of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Life beyond the Big Day is important for many brides, Berte discovered, 
especially those who are older or who are marrying again. To meet their need, 
she introduced a less formal collection of coordinates in 1992. A knee-length 
dress can be wrapped at the waist with a long, voluminous skirt, later to be 
stripped away; a jacket can be added for a perfect cocktail party outfit. The 
separates range from $400 to $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Her bridesmaids dresses, which start at $250 for a custom order and cost from 
$200 to $350 for ready-to-wear, are designed to be worn again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bridesmaids want a reusable dress," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Berte is also known for mixing two prints, such as plaid with floral, in her 
bridesmaid dresses. The patterns are unified by color and offer a slimming 
silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite starting many trends, Berte says she faces industry bias because of 
her location and as a result, in June she will pack up her Orange County 
operation after 13 years and head to the East. 
</P>
<P>
 "When buyers think of a California-based bridal company, they think of low-end 
imports," she says. "So people who have never seen us automatically put us in 
that category. It's a very difficult shadow to shake." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a showroom in Manhattan, where most of her competition is located, 
Berte says she must move if she wants to continue to climb the ranks as a 
respected bridal designer. Other advantages to the move East include a 
considerable drop in overhead, she says, and an increase in the amount she can 
charge for custom work. 
</P>
<P>
 Her most expensive creation to date sold for $7,000. It entailed more than 80 
hours of Berte's handiwork, sewing individual crystal beads onto the silk 
Shantung dress. In New York, comparable gowns start at $10,000, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she says, she never would have been successful had she skipped her 
stint in California and gone to New York right after earning a degree in 
fashion design from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have been chewed up immediately," she says. "I knew I was going to 
make it, but I wasn't going to make it in New York. There, designers are a dime 
a dozen." 
</P>
<P>
 At age 21, she came to the West on a job lead with Walt Disney Co., believing 
that she could make more of an impact in stage design than consumer fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think every designer grew up making clothes for Barbie dolls. 
I wanted to make costumes from the start," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving three months before the Disney job was to start, Berte went through a 
"nightmare of a job" with a discount retailer, before landing a dream position 
doing alterations at a Rodeo Drive boutique. Within a month and a half, she 
moved on to a neighboring Beverly Hills boutique, Elegance of Paris, where she 
was elevated from assistant to master tailor within two months. 
</P>
<P>
 On her first day at Elegance, Berte faced the intimidating task of cutting 
$85-per-yard wool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I'd been sewing half my life and it took me all day to cut a bodice and 
sleeve. I was so nervous," she says. That day she learned that if she were 
going to make it, she had to stop thinking about the price of the fabric. Now 
she works with laces that cost $400 a yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding against the Disney job when it became available, Berte instead 
assumed head designer responsibilities at Elegance of Paris. Her name was added 
to the label, and her bank account grew. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressing the Beverly Hills denizens entailed all the glamour and drama of 
costuming. But when the luster of Rodeo Drive faded in 1981, the boutique moved 
out of the area and Berte came to Orange County, where many of her longstanding 
customers lived. 
</P>
<P>
 At her first studio in Irvine, she tailored professional and party wardrobes 
for a private clientele. The festive gowns were "fussy, big and had a 
'costumey' effect. I really enjoyed making them more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, she gathered some of her client's bridal dresses and showed them to a 
buyer at Bullock's. They were too expensive for the department store to carry, 
but the buyer commissioned a line of debutante dresses, and the Janell Berte 
formal wear collection was born. Within three years, Berte became one of the 
largest distributors of debutante dresses in the country, selling to Saks Fifth 
Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a complete Berte collection debuts every October, with the current line 
featuring 28 debutante dresses, 20 bridesmaids', 10 bridal formal gowns and 10 
bridal coordinate dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 December through February is the busiest time of the year, when most of her 
ready-to-wear bridal and bridesmaid gowns and debutante dresses are being 
shipped across the country, and Berte and her nine-member staff fill custom 
orders for spring and summer brides.

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: ROYALLY CURIOUS AT CONDE NAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DEBRA GENDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 The publishing world is abuzz this week over the news that 35-year-old James 
Truman -- editor of Details magazine -- will replace the venerable Alexander 
Liberman, 81, as editorial director at Conde Nast Publications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Truman's rapid ascent, after only six years at the company, has prompted 
speculation about his ability to oversee the company's 13 magazines, including 
such style bibles as Vogue, Vanity Fair, Allure and GQ. But the young editor's 
relative inexperience is just one of the strikes against him, says the New York 
press. The other is his birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brit Takeover Riles Conde Nast Yanks" read the headline on a story in 
Thursday's New York Post. Company Chairman S.I. Newhouse "is obsessed with the 
English," a Conde Nast source told the Post, "believing their accent makes them 
morally and intellectually superior. It's cultural insecurity." 
</P>
<P>
 His fans say Truman's charming personality and his dazzling success at Details 
ensure a successful reign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect to have little to do with some magazines, which are working just 
fine," Truman told Newsday. "Others, perhaps I will have more of a hand in." 
Which those will be, he's not saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Global Cooling: Comedian Jerry Seinfeld picked up his Golden Globe award 
Saturday night and, by way of thanks, noted: "There's a lot of cleavage in this 
room!" Leave it to a guy to see cleavage where there is none. The earthquake 
must have chastened this glitzy crowd because decollete was conspicuously 
absent, making us wonder if the Globes -- which are said to portend Oscar's 
victors -- may not also portend Oscar's fashions? If so, look for lots of 
chaste, white pantsuits (Michelle Pfeiffer, Anjelica Huston, Kate Capshaw); 
chaste, minimalist slip dresses (Winona Ryder, Holly Hunter); chaste, 
high-necked Asian-inspired designs (Laura Dern, Faye Dunaway, Anjelica Huston 
-- scoring in two categories), and anything silver (Tia Carrera, Joan Chen). As 
for the men, except for Al Pacino's trademark floppy bow, collarless tuxedo 
shirts sans tie is the wave of the future (Liam Neeson and, uh, Liam Neeson and 
Liam Neeson. Did we say Liam Neeson?). 
</P>
<P>
 Out of This World: What's the single highest praise heard at any fashion show 
in Los Angeles? They didn't even look like L.A. models! Well, the food didn't 
even taste like L.A. food (it was from Patina), and the clothes didn't even 
look like L.A. clothes (they were from Milan), so, of course, the Armani show 
at the Rodeo Drive boutique this week was a smashing success -- and not, 
fortunately, in any literal sense. Even though last week's quake put the 
Emporio Armani restaurant temporarily out of commission, "we just thought the 
show should go on," a spokeswoman said. Keeping in that spirit were about 250 
of Armani's best customers, among them Lily Zanuck, Laura Dern, Maria Shriver, 
Linda Bruckheimer and Candy Spelling -- a group so beautiful, they didn't even 
look like L.A. women. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Exposure: The average American man will get his first taste of the 
much-ballyhooed British tailoring trend -- you know, three-button jackets, 
mixed patterns, snugger fit, vests -- by way of the 1994 Winter Olympics next 
month. "The men were squeamish till they saw how great the clothes looked on," 
said L.A.-based Richard Valenza, whose Ward Rhobe Management Corp. put together 
wardrobes for the CBS announcers hosting the event. "The vests, especially, 
hide a multitude of sins." 
</P>
<P>
 At the last Winter Games, Valenza introduced the viewing public to earth tones 
and designer Joseph Abboud. But this time, his mission was to find a menswear 
manufacturer who had interpreted the cutting-edge tailored look in a palatable 
way. Faconnable, a French line available exclusively at Nordstrom stores 
nationwide, was the winner. "I can imagine viewers in Iowa saying, 'Who the 
hell put these people together?' " said Valenza, referring to the pattern mix. 
</P>
<P>
 The female announcers -- Paula Zahn, Andrea Joyce and Tracy Wilson -- will 
dress in Nordstrom's in-house line, Classiques Entier. In exchange, the company 
will get on-screen credits. The only drawback to what seems like a beautiful 
relationship is that the fall/winter clothing will be unavailable to shoppers. 
When the Games begin Feb. 12, the stores will be full of spring clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoop: Speaking of the Winter Olympics, we were pleased to hear that our 
favorite late-night guy and "Cabin Boy" scene stealer, DA-VID LETTERMAN, will 
be dispatching a correspondent to Lillehammer. No, not little Regis Philbin! 
Moms Letterman, the long-suffering, flat-voweled gal whom Dave so clearly 
adores, will serve as the show's eyes and ears on Norway.

CAFE SOCIETY / MILLIE'S: BOHEMIAN IN BLACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE SEIPP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Place: Millie's, a breakfast/lunch place, 3524 Sunset Blvd., Silver Lake; 
(213) 664-0404. 
</P>
<P>
 Atmosphere: This casual, friendly neighborhood hangout is decorated with 
vintage items -- a clock, telephone and mini-jukeboxes. Most customers sit at 
the counter and chat affably on a first-name basis with the "sure, whatever" 
waitresses who serve "hangtown fry," "devil's mess," soda pop and chicken-fried 
steak. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving-Up Style: The bohemian help wear their faces scrubbed and makeup-less. 
A youthfully maternal waitress flounces behind the counter in a pink, 
thrift-shop dress, black apron and plastic fish earrings. A tall waitress-cook 
wears a black beret over her short blond locks and a white apron over her 
sleeveless red T-shirt and baggy jeans. A cryptic, buxom dishwasher broodingly 
appears and disappears in her exotic shaved head, four silver hoop earrings, 
skintight top, black jeans, black apron, beaded African necklace and yellow 
rubber gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Customer Themes: A just rolled-out-of-bed look dominates among the clientele, 
who wear looks-like-they-were-slept-in sweat shirts, sweat pants, heavy hiking 
boots, backward or forward square-brimmed baseball caps, beat-up leather 
jackets, mechanic's uniforms, wildly patterned shirts and dresses, khakis and 
faded jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Hair Apparent: Men wear long, straggly, tangled locks combined with partly 
shaved-a-few-days-ago craniums and facial stubble, or neat rockabilly hair with 
sideburns. Women go shave-headed, or wear their varied-length tresses under 
hats, multi-braided or loose and unbrushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessories: Wallets suspended from long, ultra-thick chains; pierced nose and 
ear rings; eccentric novelty earrings; ethnic necklaces and bracelets; beepers; 
skinny dark glasses; the newspaper -- folded and coffee-stained. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrity Sighting: Longtime customer Flea, of the Red Hot Chili Peppers: 
("Hey, how are you? I just got 'The Blue Iguana' on laser disc!"). 
</P>
<P>
 Observation: Millie's takes a free-form attitude. "When do we open? Well, 
that's sort of a debated issue -- it's either 7 a.m. or 8 . . . depending on 
who's cookin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake Dialogue: Waitress: "I called to tell my mother I'm OK, and she 
says, 'Of course you are! What could be the matter?' She doesn't listen to the 
news." MICHELE SEIPP

 The Series: "NYPD Blue," airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Steady police detective John Kelly (David Caruso) and his crusty 
mentor, Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz, pictured with Caruso) star in a cinema ve 
rite drama that warns viewers about its sexual content and raw language. 
</P>
<P>
 Costume Designer: Brad Loman, who also designs costumes for "L.A. Law." His 
previous credits include the TV series "Civil Wars," the miniseries "L.B.J." 
and "Robert Kennedy," and the movies "Passenger 57" and "Navy SEALs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: There's little doubt that the guys at the precinct dress a few cuts 
above the way real cops do (although not as preposterously chic as Sean 
Connery's custom Armani-ized LAPD detective in last summer's "Rising Sun"). But 
their suits and oxford-cloth shirts of uncomplicated line, color and pattern 
help set the television noir mood, especially against the vivid blue precinct 
office walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just as you're about to be lulled into a tonal blue-gray-brown fog, the 
camera jumps to Donna Abandando (Gail O'Grady), a busty sweater girl whose idea 
of fashion hasn't changed since "Dynasty" was on the air, or Detective James 
Martinez (Nicholas Turturro), whose loud, tacky ties have street written all 
over them. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: There is a strong identification of character through shirts and ties. 
Kelly, for instance, rarely wavers from practical, American button-down oxford 
shirts and rep ties. No matter the temperature, Sipowicz is hopelessly stuck in 
short sleeves and too-wide ties. The appropriately named Lt. Arthur Fancy 
(James McDaniel), the precinct peacock, preens in tab-color shirts and 
expensive ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: Donna, a novel vision -- platinum, roller-curled hair courtesy of Marilyn 
Monroe and beaded, Angora sweaters courtesy of Linda Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Good Hair Day: Not since Lucille Ball has there been a head of red as 
exceptional as Kelly's. The shade of orange juice, his close-trimmed do is said 
to be completely natural. "It's quite wonderful to work with," Loman says. "I 
haven't found a color he can't wear." 
</P>
<P>
 We Could Live Without: With her chin-length bob and closetful of man-tailored 
silk shirts and suits, Kelly's ex-wife, Laura (Sherry Stringfield), an 
assistant district attorney, looks too expensive for this crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemline Watch: Just above the knee for attorneys Laura and Sylvia Costas 
(Sharon Lawrence); lower thigh for Donna. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I said to the producer, 'How much does Kelly make a year and how much 
of that does he spend on clothes?' " He budgeted $32 to $42 for shirts and $300 
to $450 for suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Many of Kelly's suits sport the Hertling or Nordstrom label. Fancy 
wears some by Joseph Abboud. Men's shirts are mostly from Nordstrom. Donna's 
sweaters are by Christine. Laura's clothes are mostly by Calvin Klein.

INTO THE NIGHT / BETTY GOODWIN: ALL ROADS REALLY DO LEAD TO MOCA

 The Scene: An art party of major proportions with Creative Artist Agency 
Chairman Michael Ovitz, CAA President Ron Meyer and MOCA Board Chairman David 
Laventhol, Times Mirror editor-at-large, hosting a private preview of the 
retrospective "Roy Lichtenstein" at the Museum of Contemporary Art on 
Wednesday. (It opens to the public Sunday.) 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: A concentration of art world and Hollywood heavies, including 
Sherry Lansing and Stanley Jaffe, Michael Douglas, Joel Silver, Frank Gehry, 
Peter Norton, Eli and Edythe Broad, Meryl Streep, Ellsworth Kelly, Thomas 
Krens, Bud Knapp, Al and Kathy Checchi, Irving Blum, Doug Cramer and Ames 
Cushing, Jim Corcoran, Ruth and Jake Bloom, Philip and Bea Gersh, Barbara 
Guggenheim and Bert Fields, Joe Helman, Steve Martin, Jim Goodman, Robert and 
Jane Meyerhoff, Margo Leavin, Larry Gagosian, Fred and Joan Nicholas, and MOCA 
Director Richard Koshalek and his wife, Betty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buzz: Traffic patterns ("Sunset to Elevado, Elevado to Doheny, Doheny to 
Beverly, Beverly to MOCA in 36 minutes," said Ed Ruscha of his route from West 
L.A.) and "the installation," as they call it. Since nearly everyone there had 
seen the exhibit inside the spiraling walls of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum 
in New York, where it originated last year, the positioning of paintings was of 
great interest. "Whatever you do at the Guggenheim is very special, but here's 
it's more classical," allowed Leo Castelli, one of Lichtenstein's New York 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "If I say the odds on two big ones in a row are not very great, the 
earth would shake, so I won't say that," New York-based Lichtenstein said of 
his feelings about traveling to L.A., post-quake. "I still probably think 
California is as close to paradise as we have so far here on earth," said 
Dorothy Lichtenstein, even though she and her husband arrived just in time for 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted: Ovitz said, "I'm very fond of Roy. He did the painting in our atrium 
(at CAA headquarters) and basically moved into the building for a month and a 
half, so he's part of the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "I know there must be so many people in this room I respect, but I 
don't know who they are," a hanger-on said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Statement: Dealer Sid Felsen's polka-dotted bow tie, a homage to 
Lichtenstein's signature Ben-Day dots.

BOOK REVIEW / HUMOR; ONE-LINERS ADD ONLY FLAVOR, NOT WEIGHT; THE PARTISAN BY 
BENJAMIN CHEEVER . ATHENEUM: $21, 261 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Benjamin Cheever's first novel, "The Plagiarist," came out, readers were 
happy to find that Cheever had not only inherited the writing skills of his 
father, the illustrious John Cheever, but had developed a distinctive voice of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
 In this second comic novel, Cheever again shows himself a writer of 
considerable dexterity, but here he has fallen victim to either the sophomore 
slump or the temptation to revive a bottom-drawer manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "The Partisan" is entertaining page by page, it meanders hither and 
yon in search of purpose and ends up as a coming-of-age novel filled with 
wistfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say "The Partisan" lacks a center, however, for it is built 
around the formidable presence of Jonah Collingwood, a prolific, respected, 
occasionally charming and perpetually underfinanced novelist. He lives with his 
wife and two children, Nelson and Narcissus, in a small rented house on the 
park-like Rockefeller estate in Westchester County, N.Y. He is not, however, 
the head of a happy suburban household.  
</P>
<P>
 He insists, for one thing, that his children are not his own. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nelson, in second grade, tells Jonah that a fifth-grader has called him a 
bastard, Jonah makes a point of looking the word up in a dictionary and 
informing Nelson that his schoolmate "got you dead to rights"; Jonah also 
refers to Nelson and Narcissus as "SPCA" and "fire-sale" babies because they 
were unwanted at birth, adopted by Jonah's sister-in-law and passed on to the 
Collingwoods so they could attend Westchester schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, narrating the novel as a college-student-cum-newspaper-tyro, knows the 
cloudy nature of his parentage, but it turns out to be even more complicated 
than Jonah has let on. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson works for a local giveaway weekly, and "The Partisan" begins with 
Nelson taking a classified advertisement from a mysterious doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, the doctor, John Gilbert, is at the Collingwood home befriending 
Nelson's father; he eventually reveals his intention to become Jonah's 
biographer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheever here is on to numerous comic possibilities -- Jonah deceiving Gilbert, 
Gilbert transforming Jonah, Nelson revenging himself on Jonah through Gilbert, 
or something along those lines -- but he develops only one, and not to a 
significant degree: Gilbert betrays Jonah, predictably and offstage. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheever explores more expansively Nelson's infatuation with a girl who doesn't 
care for him and his camaraderie with an office mate who does, but these 
sections of the novel, although often charming, are nonetheless evanescent. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the father/son, boy/girl themes meet -- after retrieving one of 
Nelson's unsent, maudlin love letters from the wastebasket, Jonah begins 
lecturing Nelson about women by saying, "I may not know much about love, but I 
do know something about prose" -- yet most of the time they float freely, 
pulling the novel apart rather than drawing it together. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be too harsh to characterize "The Partisan" as a series of humorous 
scenes stitched together with elaborate one-liners. But those lines are, in 
fact, the most memorable parts of the novel: Nelson, for example, says he wants 
to be a writer because on Judgment Day the "choice of words is going to be 
crucial." 
</P>
<P>
 There are many moments like that in the novel, but ultimately, they don't add 
up to much.

O.C. THEATER / MARK CHALON SMITH; REVIVING BITTERSWEET 'RAISIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A Raisin in the Sun" startled Broadway in 1959. Promptly crowned the 
quintessential play about the so-called "black experience," Lorraine 
Hansberry's drama became something of an icon for changing times. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the radical '60s were at full throttle, a curious thing happened. 
Upstarts like the Black Panthers and stage groups with political agendas 
belittled it, calling "Raisin" a too quaint, too compromising, too melodramatic 
vision of black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansberry may have been talking about progress, they sneered, but where's the 
revolution? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, "Raisin" has found a more comfortable niche. Clearly a work of 
its time -- an era when Negro was an acceptable term and the ideal of 
integration was far more elusive than it is even today -- the play is important 
nonetheless, for both historical and theatrical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk to the director and the cast of the Alternative Repertory Theatre's 
revival of "Raisin" and that comes through. The drama, which opens tonight and 
continues at the Santa Ana playhouse through March 5 in recognition of Black 
History Month, is still much respected, even revered. George C. Wolfe may have 
parodied it lustily in "The Colored Museum," but they'll have none of that at 
ART. 
</P>
<P>
 "It exposed the black experience in ways that hadn't been happening before, 
whether in the theater or anywhere else," said director Barbara Covington, an 
ART veteran. "It took African Americans out of the stereotypes (perpetuated in 
the media) and showed their truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a universal appeal that deals with dreams, honor and integrity (and) 
it certainly was the first play to have brought the white (theater) community 
out to see something about what was going on in black lives." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no disputing that "Raisin" broke through with a big clap. The piece, 
which premiered and ran for 530 performances at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, 
was voted the Best Play of the year by New York critics. Hansberry, who died 
five years later, was the first black and only the fifth woman to win the award 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The drama turns on the $10,000 Lena is expecting from her late husband's life 
insurance. Lena, the salt-of-the-earth mother of the Younger clan, wants to use 
the money to move her family out of their Chicago ghetto and into a white 
suburban housing tract. She foresees the problems with such a headstrong 
decision, but doesn't care -- her children will have a better life, no matter 
what. 
</P>
<P>
 Lena's son Walter Lee, however, has a different plan. His dream is to be his 
own boss, so he intends to use the cash to buy a liquor store. Considering who 
Walter Lee is dealing with, it's a risky, even dangerous proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 His supportive wife, Ruth, isn't sure which way to turn. Then there's Walter 
Lee's sister, the proud, smart, independent Beneatha, who dwells on her African 
roots and hopes to become a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 In discussing "Raisin," Robyn Hastings, who plays Ruth, agreed that Hansberry 
was portraying a specific period in black history, but added that the drama 
reaches beyond its original time frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's special because I can't really identify (any other play) that 
chronicles the black experience from that period," she said. "It's the time 
after the migration from the South when blacks moved up to the North during the 
industrial revolution. Lena (and her husband) were probably the first or second 
generation of that migration and it chronicles their struggles in the North. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, Hansberry's classic writing stands up through the years. She wrote a 
classic of theater in terms of characters." 
</P>
<P>
 Stefanie Williamson, in the role of Beneatha, pointed to the family's 
aspirations and willingness to struggle for what they believe as a resonant 
lesson today, when many people are facing hard days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each person has their dream and you never want to give up the dream and you 
never want to stop dreaming," she said. "In this play, you see people who have 
stopped dreaming but pick it up after awhile; each character has a different 
way that they deal with their dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 While Covington may not have dreamed about directing "Raisin," she has admired 
it for several years, placing the piece in the company of seminal American 
works like Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire" and Arthur Miller's 
"Death of a Salesman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, her decision to direct came with anxiety. Covington, who is white, 
wasn't sure she could bring the right mix of cultural experience and technical 
expertise to the production. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think directing is a twofold job (and) one of those is knowing the right 
rhythms and where to focus," she explained. "I felt comfortable about that 
(but) I felt I had to depend on the actors, that I needed a real collaboration 
when it came to exposing (African American-oriented) themes. If I was doing 
something wrong, believe me, they told me." 
</P>
<P>
 The give-and-take, according to those involved, apparently worked on the set. 
The black actors credited Covington's flexibility with helping to generate a 
productive environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did, quite frankly, have some thoughts about a white director, not from a 
racial standpoint, but because this piece is so entrenched in African American 
traditions and culture," Hastings said. "My concern was would a person of 
European descent have a handle on that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Covington was willing to learn, added Jacquelyn Levy, who plays Lena. "She 
has been very open, (asking questions like) 'What are you guys talking about?' 
and 'Tell me what this means,' " said Levy. "So we translate and she says, 
'That means that?' " 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; MESSAGE LOST ON A 'MAIDEN' IN DISTRESS; ARIEL DORFMAN'S PLAY OF 
IDEAS GETS SMOTHERED BENEATH A PLODDING PLOT LINE, DRAB DIALOGUE AND A MORASS 
OF MELODRAMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chilean author Ariel Dorfman's "Death and the Maiden," which in 1992 had the 
odd distinction of being contemporary Broadway's first play about torture, 
tells a story that needs to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject is the abuse of power, and specifically the emotional fallout 
faced by women and men who live in a place where there's recently been a brutal 
regime. Like Chile. Or El Salvador. Or South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a play you want to like -- if only because it says attention must be paid 
to the intertwinings of personal and political lives and the ways in which a 
nation's collective traumas play out, over and over again, between the sheets 
and over the morning java. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how ethically commendable the topic, nor how lofty the intent, 
pedestrian dramaturgy will kill any play. And "Death and the Maiden," alas, is 
a clunker. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in what Dorfman terms "a country that is probably Chile but could be any 
country that has given itself a democratic government just after a long period 
of dictatorship," it's the story of Paulina Salas (Wanda De Jesus), a woman who 
suddenly finds herself facing the man she believes tortured and raped her 15 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When Salas' human-rights lawyer husband Gerardo (Jimmy Smits) gets a flat tire 
on the road one night, he invites the man who stopped to help him, Dr. Miranda 
(Tomas Milian), over to the couple's posh beach house for a drink. Thinking she 
recognizes Dr. Miranda's voice, Paulina decides to put him on trial in her home 
-- at gunpoint. She wants a confession, and catharsis. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the fault here lies not with director Robert Egan and his stars -- who 
have their moments, De Jesus more than the others -- but with Dorfman's drama, 
which shows every one of its crudely sewn seams. 
</P>
<P>
 A play of ideas gets smothered here beneath a morass of melodrama. Dorfman 
dredges up all the creaky devices of the 19th-Century stage: the stranded 
traveler, the chance meeting, the overheard conversation, the binding and 
gagging of the stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Which wouldn't be so bad, if the melodramatics were a pretext for a play of 
language or philosophies. But these mechanisms don't so much set up the clash 
of ideologies as they drown it out, so loud is the creaking of the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 What you get is about 100 minutes of setup and only 20 minutes of payoff. By 
the time the play works its way to its thematic core -- the relative claims of 
vengeance, justice and the need to get on with life -- it's almost over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dorfman flings the audience back and forth every half-scene or so in these 
Perils of Paulina. First you think the doctor is the guy who tortured her, then 
you think he's probably not. One minute you figure she'll pull the trigger, the 
next you're sure she won't. And so it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as damaging as the contrivances is the frequently hokey dialogue. "And 
why does it always have to be people like me who have to sacrifice," asks 
Paulina, "why always me who has to bite her tongue, why?" Why indeed? 
</P>
<P>
 Paulina is the plum role here -- the Sarah Bernhardt/Eleonora Duse part -- and 
De Jesus can turn on the passion. Two of her monologues in particular -- 
including one where she recounts her torture to the strains of the titular 
Schubert quartet -- achieve the poignancy the rest of this evening merely 
slouches toward. 
</P>
<P>
 De Jesus doesn't seem to have much range, though, but that's probably 
Dorfman's fault as well. After all, what's a diva to do when she has to show up 
in Act I, Scene 1 waving a gun? Try to build an arc after an intro like that. 
There's just nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Smits and De Jesus have one emotionally juicy scene in which they try to 
grapple with their past. Yet aside from this bit and the final scene -- which 
takes place months after the beach house meeting, at a concert -- the former 
"L.A. Law" star doesn't show many layers to his character's psyche. Granted, 
he's playing a guy who shuts out what bugs him. But as Anthony Hopkins, for 
one, as amply demonstrated, there's more to playing uptight than simply 
behaving stiffly. 
</P>
<P>
 Milian spends a good deal of stage time bound and gagged -- on Yael Pardess' 
elegantly upper-bourgeois living room set -- and can offer up only the 
occasional emu bray during these segments. Otherwise, he's amusing, if not 
menacing. But he really should be both. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Dorfman, director Egan is tuned into both the personal and political 
passions at work here. His staging gets some steam going in the monologues and 
more intimate moments, but falls flat in the group scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, while it isn't Egan's strongest outing, the major culprit is the text. 
Though the playwright's goals are beyond reproach, Dorfman threatens to become 
the Dion Boucicault of the Amnesty International age.

MUSIC REVIEW; A PROGRAM OF CONTRASTS BY PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Zinman seldom fails to provoke. The distinguished American conductor, 
serving as guest on the Los Angeles Philharmonic podium this week, has put 
together a program of contrasts: pristine Vivaldi, in the only concerto for two 
cellos that composer ever wrote; Christopher Rouse's brand-new, strikingly 
violent Cello Concerto, in its world premiere; and Brahms' beloved Second 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first of three performances of this agenda Wednesday night in the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Zinman coaxed subtle yet firm and motivated playing 
from the orchestra for the Vivaldi piece -- Ronald Leonard and Yo-Yo Ma were 
the soloists -- put the new Rouse work in its best light while collaborating 
with cellist Ma, and revived Brahms' arguably most mellow symphonic work with 
high energy yet controlled exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioned by Betty Freeman to mark the Philharmonic's 75th anniversary, the 
American composer's new Cello Concerto is in two disparate movements tied 
together by a cadenza. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, soloist and ensemble creak, screech and shriek; from the 
beginning, there is noisy hostility between them. This musical antipathy is not 
a contest, however, or even a struggle -- it is, rather, a steady tugging away 
from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 After a number of engagements, or, if you will, episodes, each ending in, or 
interrupted by, a hammer-blow climax, the bridging cadenza leads the listener 
into a quiet but uncomforting finale, one punctuated with "grief-laden" (the 
composer's word) and elegiac passages. At the Upbeat Live event prior to the 
performance, Rouse called the work "depressing," a word that does not begin to 
give the flavor of the concerto's more-than-complex sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Soloist Ma, his legendary virtuosity at the ready, leaped all technical and 
musical hurdles as if they were simple knots to be untied. He also seemed to go 
to the core of the work's emotional life, a layering of contradictions and 
subtexts, making sense out of ostensible non sequiturs and creating continuity 
out of chaos. Zinman and the orchestra operated on the same apparent level of 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The new work, and the positive response from the large audience gathered in 
the Pavilion on Wednesday, cry out for second, third and subsequent hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 This evening began with a minor masterpiece disguised as an overture: 
Vivaldi's G-minor Concerto for Two Cellos, as played by Leonard (on first) and 
Ma. The two soloists matched each other tone for tone, phrase for phrase, and 
at all dynamic levels; Zinman led the orchestra with an inspired hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Some listeners cannot get enough Brahms; for them, this unpressured but joyous 
reconsideration of the treasured D-major Symphony had to be a treat in terms of 
mellow sound, persuasive rhetoric and emotional resonance. As he had, last week 
in Shostakovich's Tenth Symphony, hornist Jerry Folsom -- among other 
cherishable orchestral soloists -- sang out his solos with a sound of burnished 
glory.

RECORD REVIEWS; POP ADVENTURE AND GOTHIC WIT; BIG ENJOYERS REDISCOVER THE JOY 
OF DABBLING; BABYLONIAN TILES PUT A NEW BLOOM ON GLOOM 
</P>

<P>
 This crop of local album releases is highlighted by the often delightful 
studio inventions of Big Enjoyers and by Babylonian Tiles' surprisingly fresh 
and varied take on gloomy old Gothic rock. Also reviewed are new CDs from 
Somebody's Ex, Gameface and Warhorse. Ratings range from * (why bother) to **** 
(a reason to live). Three stars denote a solid recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 *** Big Enjoyers "Gronkin' Quiver" 
</P>
<P>
 Neabuzz Records  
</P>
<P>
 One of pure pop's biggest sources of enjoyment is Todd Rundgren's 1972 album 
"Something/Anything," which materialized when one guy hauled a bunch of 
recording equipment into his living room and let a gifted ear for melody and a 
free-ranging imagination be his guides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gronkin' Quiver" is no "Something/Anything" but it preserves some of the 
spirit of home-cooked dabbling that made Rundgren's do-it-yourself album such a 
treat. This time, it's two guys and a bunch of recording equipment, and they 
seem to have enjoyed themselves hugely in putting together this wildly diverse 
(if uneven), often diverting CD. 
</P>
<P>
 J. L. Bostock sings lead and plays the guitar, bringing simultaneous shades of 
Tom Petty and Jerry Garcia to the vocals and displaying a knack for tasty 
fuzztone constructions. Partner Tom Neas pitches in on drums, backing vocals 
and some keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The album opens with the lush, shiny pop of "Aiming Fore the Green," a song 
that sounds like low-budget Ambrosia as it aptly casts that most frustrating of 
human activities, the game of golf, as a metaphor for all life's other 
frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 A sharp turn into catchy psychedelic pop yields "Magic Voyage" which, had it 
come along 25 years ago, could have been one of the savory late-'60s AM radio 
morsels that gained such one-hit wonders as the Amboy Dukes, the Lemon Pipers 
and the Strawberry Alarm Clock their small but legitimate claims on posterity. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensibility is eccentric throughout as Big Enjoyers take excursions 
through folkish strumming ("Goode Song") and airy, Youngbloods-like trippy pop 
("I Wanted"). Things get downright weird during the spacey "She's a Vampire," 
which sounds like lounge music from another galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the lyrics are mystical/philosophical musings about the inscrutable, 
disappointing or wondrous nature of being, which would make for pretty dippy 
going if Big Enjoyers didn't make sure to include a strong measure of 
self-deprecating humor. The album ends with its tour de force, "The Cat That 
Came to Broadway," as the duo draws primarily upon the sleek funk of Kool & the 
Gang and George Benson to concoct an inventive mini-symphony of pop. Playing 
the part of a fellow who finds himself sadly adrift in life, Bostock lends this 
odd piece emotional bite with an affectingly lonesome vocal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gronkin' Quiver" is well worth hearing for fans who think smart, imaginative 
pop is the nazz. 
</P>
<P>
 (Available from Neabuzz Records, 629 Terminal Way, Suite 1, Costa Mesa, CA 
92627). *** 
</P>
<P>
 Babylonian Tiles 
</P>
<P>
 "Basking in the Sun at Midnight" 
</P>
<P>
 Nate Starkman & Son  
</P>
<P>
 Casual listeners who don't favor black garb or cultivate a vampire-pale 
complexion might quickly dismiss the Tiles' first CD release as so much 
death-obsessed, gloomy Gothic posing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there are some insufferable bands like that out there, but this isn't one 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryna Golden, the Tiles' main singer and songwriter, doesn't make the mistake 
of falling in love with the dark side. Instead, in this album's more serious 
moments, she probes the gloom for flickers of hope. Not willing to submit and 
embrace grim fate during the eerie, sepulchral epic "Rain People," she sings of 
responsibility and the need to seek something better: 
</P>
<P>
 So pick up the pieces and dance,  
</P>
<P>
 dance to the choices in life,  
</P>
<P>
 the strength we have in ourselves  
</P>
<P>
 and show the world I'm here.  
</P>
<P>
 The dark side does have its spooky allure, however, and Babylonian Tiles 
captures it in songs that, instead of taking evil and woe too seriously, go for 
the fun of a campfire horror tale well-told. 
</P>
<P>
 The band weaves its moods with strong all-around musicianship. Golden's 
keyboards create an artsy/garagey psychedelic backdrop reminiscent of both the 
Doors and the Seeds. Babylonian Tiles' tales can be slow to unfold, but the 
band works enough turns and shifts in texture into the longer songs to sustain 
interest. Double-tracked vocals help bolster Golden's thin but evocative voice. 
</P>
<P>
 While dolorous sighs and exhalations may be primary for the Tiles, they make 
sure to mix things up. "Each Dying Breath" has a tumbling, tribal beat that 
recalls such British sources as Siouxsie and the Banshees and Ride; "No One 
Now" lightens its contemplation of death and isolation with a jaunty, waltzing 
tempo. "Never Growing Old," written by drummer Brian Schreiber and sung by 
bassist Marcus Mindte, is like one of Syd Barrett's strange ramblings, 
simultaneously eerie and jaunty in its contemplation of an early exit from 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all pretty melodramatic, but with a wit and a humane quality that keep it 
from sinking into the leaden crypt occupied by much of Gothic rock. 
</P>
<P>
 (Available from Babylonian Tiles, 7771 15th St., No. 3, Westminster, CA 
92683). * Babylonian Tiles plays Feb. 26 at the Electric Circus, 314 N. Beach 
Blvd., Buena Park. $5. (714) 827-1210. ** Somebody's Ex 
</P>
<P>
 "Defective" 
</P>
<P>
 (no label) 
</P>
<P>
 This all-female Orange County/Long Beach band takes pains not to get typecast 
as the new Go-Gos (although it can be effervescently garagey), the new Bangles 
(although it can be sleekly poppy) or the new L7 (although it can get 
momentarily grungy and sometimes likes to talk dirty). 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, while avoiding stylistic labels, Somebody's Ex neglects to 
bring much emotional depth or psychological insight to its work. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of "Defective" is well-played and sung. Jill Warren writes the songs and 
has a good ear for mainstream pop melody. She also dabs on some nice guitar 
touches, acoustic as well as electric. Lisa Wright, who shares the lead vocals 
with Warren, has a dusky, full-bodied voice that powers the album's best songs: 
"It's Just the Moon," which echoes the chorus hook of the Rolling Stones' 
"Sway," and the lush "Through My Eyes," which could well have been overblown 
but is handled with admirable restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 While one can appreciate the band's skills, too many songs seem poorly 
thought-out and lacking in complexity. A funkified version of Leon Russell's 
oft-covered "Superstar" is tossed off as bland dance-floor fodder. There is a 
coldly dismissive cast to "F. Defective," which dumps on a woman whose habitual 
nonconformity has degenerated into self-destruction. And there is little 
sympathy or understanding at hand in "Juliet," whose protagonist's strait-laced 
upbringing leaves her sexually repressed. The songs are superficial sketches 
that set up cheap shots at easy targets. 
</P>
<P>
 The nadir comes with "(Sex) The Way It Goes," which tears a page from Erica 
Jong as it trumpets the frank expression of female lust. This sort of bluntly 
carnal talk is being heralded as a sign of new expressive freedom for women 
rockers (Liz Phair being Exhibit A) but I'll take a little indirection and 
artifice any day, regardless of the singer's gender. The great blues singers, 
for example, always deal in clever euphemism, because it is sexier and more fun 
than the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, the song blithely counsels unfaithfulness ("Forget your 
conscience, singe and burn it away") while offering no more motive for the 
betrayal than a quick assuagement of raging hormones. Maybe Warren just wanted 
to churn out something that would heat up a bar crowd; a songwriter attuned to 
the way sex really goes, with its complexities and high emotional stakes, would 
have intimated the potentially devastating consequences of heeding such a 
blatant come-on. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody's Ex might partly have redeemed the song by bookending it immediately 
with "Pictures of You and Her," which depicts a woman wrung out by her lover's 
cheating ways. But five songs intervene between the two, so any chance for 
contrast and cross-current is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 (Available at Tower Records in El Toro and Hollywood, Sound Spectrum in Laguna 
Beach, or through Somebody's Ex, 21214 E. Ocean Blvd., No. 1, Long Beach, CA 
90803). ** Gameface "Good" 
</P>
<P>
 Network Sound  
</P>
<P>
 If the CD cover didn't say otherwise, I would swear that this was a new Big 
Drill Car album. 
</P>
<P>
 The resemblances between that well-established Orange County punk-pop band and 
this relative newcomer are uncanny. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitar sound is clean and edgy, with riffs that move like rolling slabs. 
Singer Jeff Caudill has much the same range and timbre as BDC's Frank Daly, and 
the melodies have a similar steady (and ultimately too predictable and 
unvaried) rise and fall. The subject matter and attitude are quite similar, too 
-- both bands offer an earnest engagement of post-adolescent, coming-of-age 
issues, expressed in tersely declarative lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Gameface does improve on the Big Drill Car concept by adding some backing 
harmonies. And there are strokes of imagination here. "Soap" is a strange 
little pornographic tale of voyeurism narrated by an insect -- part Kafka, part 
the Who's "Boris the Spider," part Penthouse Forum. But Gameface's blitzing 
pace and monolithic delivery send it through the same blender as everything 
else on the album, and a quirky story fails to get the distinctive musical 
setting it requires. 
</P>
<P>
 In other signs of a healthy artistic imagination, "Friday Matinee" offers a 
skewed glimpse of a lovelorn soul's daydreaming, while the pairing of "The Last 
Song" and the appealingly wistful "Retraction" sum up what it's like to be 
utterly confused over where a relationship is heading. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Drill Car is a solid but severely limited band that always has seemed to 
skate back and forth over the same patch of ice when it needed to be turning 
figure-eights. It does little good for any other band to retrace the same 
well-worn grooves that don't lead anywhere special. Gameface has potential, but 
it needs to break this pattern before it Drills again. 
</P>
<P>
 (Available from Network Sound, P.O. Box 5213, Huntington Beach, CA 92615).  
</P>
<P>
 Gameface plays tonight at 8 at the Ice House in Fullerton on a local rock bill 
with One Eye Open, Nuckle Brothers, Guttermouth and Sublime. The show is sold 
out.  
</P>
<P>
 * 1/2 Warhorse 
</P>
<P>
 "Articulous Symphonious" 
</P>
<P>
 Panacea Records  
</P>
<P>
 To paraphrase Chuck Berry, there's too much Eddie business going on in rock 
these days. The vocal style of Pearl Jam's Mr. Vedder is getting copied almost 
as often as the guitar style of the immortal Chuck -- maybe even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Warhorse jumps on the sounds-like-Eddie bandwagon, and the result is a 
hard-rock record fraught with bleakly titanic musings intended to be delivered 
with cry-to-the-winds grandeur. Run-amok police, decaying urban landscapes and 
murderous youth are sketched in the songs, none of them rendered particularly 
vivid in routine, sometimes awkward lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and just in case the Eddie thing runs its course, there's a Billy Idol 
imitation, a bluesy Jim Morrison knock-off and a token, utterly out-of-place 
pop-metal romantic anthem to show the band's range, if not its individuality.  
</P>
<P>
 In short, "Articulous Symphonious" sounds like the work of a band too little 
concerned with finding its own voice and too eager to fit a mold that might 
qualify it for Contractus Majoricus Labelicus. 
</P>
<P>
 (Available from Dee Entertainment, P.O. Box 1152, Bellflower, CA 90707).  
</P>
<P>
 Warhorse plays Feb. 12 at JJ's Lounge, 1815 E. Chapman, Orange. (714)

 STAGE 
</P>
<P>
 'Jeffrey' Moves to Big Screen: In one of the fastest transitions from theater 
to film in recent years, the Off Broadway hit "Jeffrey," seen in L.A. recently 
at the Westwood Playhouse, has been optioned as a movie by one of its stage 
producers and will begin shooting in New York in July. It will be produced by 
the play's co-producer, Mitchell Maxwell, in association with "Jeffrey" 
playwright Paul Rudnick, who completed the screenplay last week. "Because no 
studio would buy 'Jeffrey,' we bought it and have made a deal with Paul Rudnick 
to write it and have him co-produce it with us," said Maxwell, who heads the 
production company Workin' Man Films. Maxwell said the movie version of 
"Jeffrey," a comedy about a gay man who chooses celibacy so he won't get AIDS, 
would be aimed primarily at the art-house circuit.

 * Broderick's Turn 'to Succeed': Matthew Broderick will star in a revival of 
"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying," to be directed by Des 
McAnuff in his swan song as artistic director at the La Jolla Playhouse, Oct. 
30-Dec. 4. Other new additions to the La Jolla season include Marivaux's "The 
Triumph of Love," in a new translation by James Magruder, to be directed by 
Lisa Peterson in repertory with the previously announced "Therese Raquin," June 
19-Aug. 14, and the West Coast debut of Canadian clowns Mump (Michael Kennard) 
and Smoot (John Turner) in "Ferno," Sept. 4-Oct. 2.

 * The Reviews Are In: New York critics liked the staging by Oskar Eustis, the 
Mark Taper Forum's associate artistic director, of Philip Kan Gotanda's "Day 
Standing on Its Head" at Manhattan Theatre Club, but they didn't think much of 
the play itself. Gotanda "tries to do way too much in this stylistically 
overloaded -- but frequently haunting -- one-act portrait" of a man's midlife 
crisis, wrote Linda Winer in Newsday. And Ben Brantley of the New York Times 
found "disappointingly few original insights." QUAKE RELIEF

available until next week, Tuesday's speech averaged a combined 33.4 rating on 
the ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox networks in the 29 major markets. If that figure 
holds up in the national ratings, it would mean Clinton was seen in about 31.5 
million homes. The speech was also carried by various Public Broadcasting

MOVIE REVIEW; BELIEVABILITY TAKES A LEAP IN HWANG'S 'GATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Golden Gate" (selected theaters) is as ambitious as it is disastrous. David 
Henry Hwang, who wrote "M. Butterfly," one of the most provocative and 
successful American plays in recent years, has taken an important premise only 
to let it lapse into a protracted soap opera. The question Hwang poses 
implicitly is this: How many of us are aware that Chinese Americans were 
subjected to persecution by the FBI because the Communist Revolution in China 
happened to coincide with the McCarthy era? 
</P>
<P>
 In its opening sequences, "Golden Gate" would seem to be illuminating this 
injustice in promising fashion. It's San Francisco, 1952, and J. Edgar Hoover 
has ordered the local bureau to ferret out commies in Chinatown. Brand-new 
agent Kevin Walker (Matt Dillon) hits upon an idea: Go after a laundryman, Chen 
Jung Song (Tzi Ma, in the film's most eloquent performance), who has collected 
funds to send via Hong Kong to his and his friends' impoverished relatives in 
the recently formed People's Republic of China.  
</P>
<P>
 In the climate of anti-communist hysteria it's not hard to get him sent to 
prison for 10 years for "trading with the enemy." Upon his release he's shunned 
by his community, and since Walker is ordered to hound him some more, the 
laundryman jumps to his death off a promontory overlooking the Golden Gate 
Bridge. Walker at long last commences to get a serious case of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 So far OK, but darned if Walker, concealing his identity, proceeds to court 
the dead man's beautiful daughter Marilyn (Joan Chen), now a Berkeley law 
student involved in a campaign to clear her father's name, which fits right in 
with the mood of the anti-war activist '60s.  
</P>
<P>
 Since Dillon and Chen look like movie stars, their mutual attraction is 
certainly credible, and what Hwang attempts is to stir up a love between them 
so overpowering that it overrides both Walker's well-deserved sense of shame 
and Marilyn's horror when she inevitably finds out that her lover is the man 
who systematically and unjustly destroyed her father. Tempestuous emotions 
trigger lots of scenery-chewing, leading to increasing ludicrousness. In danger 
of drowning in the suds is Hwang's important point that there's a tendency to 
regard Asian Americans as "perpetual foreigners." 
</P>
<P>
 Chen and especially Dillon are gallant, but they don't seem to get much help 
from director John Madden, whose first theatrical film was "Ethan Frome." 
Madden directs everything head on, without a trace of subtlety or 
understatement. Thanks to Hwang's writing, compounded by Madden's heavy hand, 
Bruno Kirby, as Walker's straight-arrow superior, and Stan Egi, as a fiery '60s 
activist, emerge as caricatures. "Golden Gate" looks great, thanks to the 
meticulous, evocative contributions of production designer Andrew Jackness, 
costume designer Ingrid Ferrin and cinematographer Bobby Bukowski, but it's 
pure dross.

JAZZ NOTES: RUSHEN TO 'STRETCH OUT' AT BRASSERIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE tIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just because keyboardist Patrice Rushen's appearances on the L.A. club circuit 
have become infrequent at best, don't think she's given up her jazz career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to play, I have to play," says the 39-year-old Los Angeles native. "So 
even if I'm playing less in the clubs, I get together with musicians and play. 
I make time because it's fun and I want to stay sharp so that if someone calls, 
I'm ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Like last month, when Rushen took part in an American Foundation for AIDS 
Research (AMFAR) fund-raiser at the Playboy mansion in Holmby Hills. Rushen 
performed with such notables as Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and Larry 
Carlton. "I had a really nice time, playing tunes like 'I Loves You, Porgy,' " 
Rushen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight and Saturday, Rushen is appearing with drummer Gerry Gibbs' quartet at 
the Club Brasserie in West Hollywood. It's her first performance in a strictly 
modern mainstream groove -- her avowed style when she broke onto the jazz scene 
-- in ages. "I'll really get a chance to stretch out, which always is fun," she 
says. "We rehearsed Gerry's tunes the other night. His music is very 
interesting. He really likes to play fast, so it's, 'Oh, OK, hold on!' " she 
chuckles. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Rushen has been active mostly as a composer and arranger for 
TV and film projects such as Robert Townsend's "Hollywood Shuffle," "The 
People's Choice Awards," and the "NAACP Image Awards." She also produced pop 
singer Sheena Easton's 1993 album, "No Strings," for MCA Records. The album 
features guitarist Phil Upchurch, saxman Bob Sheppard and drummer Ndugu 
Chancler behind Easton's versions of such songs as "The Nearness of You," "Body 
and Soul" and "How Deep Is the Ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Rushen, who appears with longtime colleague Chancler in the group One + 1, is 
planning on doing more live playing, including a stand at the Vine Street Bar 
and Grill. "The scene seems to be opening up, and that's inspirational," she 
says. New Policy at Vine Street: Mayuto Correa, the innovative Brazilian 
percussionist who has played with everyone from Freddie Hubbard to Hugh 
Masekela, is now booking the acts at the Vine Street Bar and Grill, where the 
jazz policy has been intermittent in past months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going berserk, doing the booking, the promoting, but it feels good," says 
Correa, 50. "This is my way of helping, of giving something back" to music. 
</P>
<P>
 Correa, who appeared Wednesday and Thursday at Vine Street with an all-star 
band that included drummer Chancler and saxophonist Ernie Watts, plans to 
feature a variety of jazz styles from straight ahead and contemporary to 
Brazilian and Latin flavored. Correa says he intends to bring in such top names 
as saxophonists Ronnie Laws and Gerald Albright and Rushen in March and April, 
though specific dates have not yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
 The new schedule at Vine Street gets underway next week. Every Tuesday, 
Correa, pianist Greg Kurstin and saxman Louis Taylor host a jam session. Each 
Wednesday and Thursday, Third Millienium, featuring saxmen Phil Farris and 
Tracy Wannomae, is on tap. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the weekend lineup: tonight, Saturday, and Feb. 4-5, pianist singer 
Hadda Brooks;Feb. 11-12, Correa, Watts, Chancler, singer Dwight Tribble, 
trombonist Thurman Green and guitarist Bradley Bobo; Feb. 18-19, Green's 
quartet, and Feb. 25-26, Latin jazz with Rudy Regalado and Chevere. 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (213) 463-4375. Critic's Choices: The Lincoln Center Jazz 
Orchestra, scheduled to appear Feb. 4 at UCLA's Royce Hall, will now perform 
Thursday at the Wadsworth Theatre. Earthquake damage to Royce Hall, which will 
be closed for approximately 6 months, forced the change in schedule. The band 
sports such top players as saxman Joshua Redman, trumpeter Ryan Kisor and 
pianist Marcus Roberts and offers renditions of the music of, among others, 
Jelly Roll Morton, John Coltrane and Duke Ellington.  
</P>
<P>
 Versatile, crafty pianist Bill Cunliffe leads a fine trio Sunday at the Jazz 
Bakery. Armed with drummer Joe LaBarbera and bassist Dave Carpenter, Cunliffe 
debuts selections from his soon-to-be-released "A Rare Connection" album.

MUSIC REVIEW; I MUSICI VEERS FROM TIRED TO TERRIFIC AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Italian chamber ensemble I Musici is now more than 40 years old, and has 
begun to sound it. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at the forefront of the Italian Baroque music revival,the group now seems 
almost hopelessly out of style, a quaint reminder of how far we've come in 
understanding this antique repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, after a soporific first half at Ambassador Auditorium Wednesday night, 
the Rome-based ensemble, headed by violinist Mariana Sirbu from the 
concertmistress chair, tore into and delivered an astonishing performance of 
Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 The program featured Italian concertos. The group's sound is top-heavy and 
violin-driven, with the basses and harpsichord following meekly rather than 
urging the music forward, as is now the historical fashion. In Corelli's 
Concerto Grosso, Opus 6, No. 4, it proved too homogenous for the concertino to 
have much effect, though the playing was polished. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgettable is probably too kind a word for the Viola Concerto, Opus 3, by 
Alessandro Rolla, with its cookie-cutter tunes and etude-book virtuosity. 
Massimo Paris played it cleanly and tried to squeeze in some nuance, but it 
lasted a long 25 minutes anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellist Francesco Strano made the only strong pre-intermission impression with 
his wonderfully fragile and rhythmically sculpted reading of Tartini's Cello 
Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 The forceful and variegated "Four Seasons" saved the day, however. Sirbu 
attacked the solo part with equal parts vigor and firm sensitivity, and showed 
off a world-class technique in the process. The other players painted details 
convincingly, shaded, sawed and lilted passionately. There's life in them old 
bows yet. TIMOTHY MANGAN

MUSIC REVIEW; SHANGHAI QUARTET TACKLES BEETHOVEN WITH YOUTHFUL VIGOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Shanghai Quartet probably has all the virtues that a fairly youthful 
quartet can and should have -- intensity, vibrancy and commitment, in addition 
to fine technique and ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 What it mostly lacks, autumnal wisdom, undoubtedly only the wearing process of 
time can bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Such were the impressions when the Quartet played a program consisting mostly 
of Beethoven quartets in B-flat -- Opus 18, No. 6 and Opus 130 -- on Wednesday 
in the Leo S. Bing Theater at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 The two quartets are separated by an epochal quarter century and yet related 
in sharing disjunctive structure. Violinists Weigang Li and Honggang Li (who 
are brothers), violist Zheng Wang and cellist James Wilson applied similar 
vigor and power and hot-blooded intensity to each. 
</P>
<P>
 They launched the earlier (1800) work with vibrant, joyful sunniness and 
confidence. They skated through the awkward syncopations and accenting of the 
Scherzo. But they sounded disconnected from the mood that opens the last 
movement -- "La Malinconia" (Melancholy) -- and seemed more at home when the 
tempo revved up. 
</P>
<P>
 Opus 130 (1825) emerged with power and grace, to be sure, but not with deep 
introspection. In the full-throated statements of the first movement, the 
Quartet seemed more to seize the heavens by the throat rather than witness the 
heavens opening up. They were touching in the Cavatina, but not heartbreaking. 
This was not an older man's work. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also included the first Los Angeles performance of Long Zhou's 
"Song of the Ch'in," an evocative, eight-minute tone painting applying 
sophisticated compositional techniques to what sound like fragments of 
traditional Chinese melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 As an encore, the quartet offered Puccini's "Chrysanthemums," proving that the 
composer did not confine his pathetic-heroic strain solely to opera.

ART REVIEWS; NEW INSPIRATION FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two exhibitions of prints from Czechoslovakia tell a cliched tale about the 
relationship between communism and art. At Loyola Marymount University's Laband 
Art Gallery, "Flesh and Spirit: Middle European Reflections on Mythology and 
Religion Before the Fall of Communism" insists that the impulse to make art is 
as strong as the human will to live and cannot be crushed -- or controlled -- 
by any political system. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Monica's Parnas Gallery similar reflections take place, but this time 
after communism's fall in the Velvet Revolution of 1989, which lead to 
democratic elections and Vaclav Havel's presidency. An explosion of color, a 
wider range of scale, a broader scope of subjects and a greater diversity of 
styles suggest that communism's demise was accompanied by a jolt of expressive 
freedom and a jump of artistic experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong sense of individualism unites these before-and-after exhibitions. The 
10 artists in the "before" half appear to be fixated on European art history or 
stubbornly focused on the grand cycle of life. References to Renaissance and 
Baroque masterpieces by Brueghel, Caravaggio, Durer, Van Eyck and Vermeer 
abound, although quotes from rock superstars Pink Floyd and Bob Dylan also 
enter into the picture, in two collages by Jan Krejci. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 37 works shown, 14 by Jiri Anderle ensure that the exhibition is 
heavily slanted toward mortality and melancholia. The 57-year-old artist's 
realistic, freeze-frame displays of youth's passage through maturity to death 
evoke a vanitas tradition, in which the pleasures of the flesh are tempered by 
the knowledge that they will inevitably pass. 
</P>
<P>
 A subtext of rebellion, however, underlies this emphasis on the transitory 
nature of human existence. Henry F. Klein, the curator of the exhibition and an 
art professor at L.A. Valley College, contends that Czech and Slovak artists 
invoked European art history to register their discontent with state programs. 
They staked their claim to the great tradition of Western individualism, or 
stoically referred to life's inevitable passing, in order to sketch an 
alternative to Soviet influence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "after" half of the show, the past disappears as a point of reference, 
replaced by the stylistic freedom of Modern art. Realism, social commentary and 
narrative metaphor give way to individual searches for personal expression. 
Jaroslav Serych's stylized figures, Ladislav Kuklik's brooding women, Josef 
Dudek's robot-people and Zdenek Netopil's tangled nests of flesh outline a wide 
variety of approaches to the human form and quickly recap the history of 
Modernism. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous art, however, is not the only source for creativity. The more recent 
work seems to be influenced by photographic reproductions, as if the biggest 
change brought about by communism's fall was an influx of glossy magazines. Eva 
Vlasakova's colorful monotypes and Tomas Hrivnac's abstract figures appear to 
be indebted to illustrations from fashionable periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than making a convincing argument about communism's hostility toward 
art and its flourishing after the fall, the two exhibitions suggest that 
artists in Czechoslovakia have simply traded one source of inspiration for 
another, equally valuable influence. 
</P>

 * Laband Art Gallery, Loyola Marymount University, Loyola Blvd. at West 80th 
St., Westchester, (310) 338-2880; and Parnas Gallery, 1547 10th St., Santa 
Monica, (319) 458-6335; both through Feb. 26. Closed Sundays through Tuesdays.  
</P>
<P>
 Deceptively Simple: Six crisp paintings by Penelope Krebs show the 
40-year-old, L.A.-based painter to be making the best work of her career. More 
concentrated and complicated than any of her earlier abstractions, the 
deceptively simple stripe paintings at Kiyo Higashi Gallery celebrate color in 
its most wildly unnatural state. 
</P>
<P>
 Each approximately two-foot-square panel consists of 11 vertical bands 
separated by narrow black stripes. Perfectly painted, they recall the seemingly 
infinite sense of  
</P>
<P>
 possibility that races through kids' minds when they open their first giant 
box of crayons and gaze, in silent amazement, at the 128 different colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Krebs' oils-on-canvas induce a similar sort of speechlessness. Before their 
odd combinations of color and exquisite mixes of pigment, the viewer is often 
at a complete loss for words. Struggling to come up with an adequate 
description for a single stripe is frustrating in itself, but doubly so when 
you discover that Krebs has positioned another almost indistinguishable stripe 
a few bars away. 
</P>
<P>
 Its slight differences in tone, hue and value make your description of the 
first stripe seem grossly inaccurate and in need of radical revision and 
refinement. These ongoing adjustments and calibrations are mirrored in the 
queasy tricks the paintings play on your eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp, perfectly ruled contours of their stripes soon begin to warp 
outward whenever you focus on them. Putting a kink in vision's clarity, they 
create the sensation that they might be breathing, pulsing or swelling. 
</P>
<P>
 The animate visual energy of Krebs' new paintings distinguishes them from her 
earlier, larger, more static abstractions, whose saturated stripes don't 
vibrate, but lay on the canvas like flat slabs of color. By contrast, her 
latest body of work is so optically engaging that it tempts us to think that 
the best paintings are not inanimate objects at all, but ongoing events that 
invite us to enter into their flux in order to tune up our eyes.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; PRETTY GOOD GRUB FOR A POOL HALL; THE HOLLYWOOD ATHLETIC 
CLUB'S GRILL ROOM IS STILL ONE OF THE GREAT ROOMS IN L.A. -- A FINE PLACE TO 
EAT DINNER OR SHOOT A RACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Hollywood Athletic Club, that magnificent stone building on Sunset just 
west of Cahuenga, is not actually an athletic club. It is a pool hall. If you 
want a real athletic club, walk up the side street to the Hollywood YMCA. If 
you want to play pool, or have a drink, or eat dinner, or host a private party, 
the Hollywood Athletic Club will suit you fine. (It's a good place to keep in 
mind if you're going to one of the nearby theaters.) 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't always know that the Hollywood Athletic Club is not a gym. So I was 
initially quite surprised when I walked through the front door and into a haze 
of cigarette smoke. It makes sense: The downstairs is filled by dozens of 
beautiful, full-sized pool tables. A sea of green felt. Heaven knows, shooting 
pool, smoking cigarettes and drinking beer out of long-neck bottles is one of 
life's great pleasures. Even those of us who may no longer indulge can't argue 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, I was all the more surprised walking into the Grill Room, the restaurant 
on the premises, when I saw smokers -- not just in the bar area, but in the 
dining room proper. Our waitress explained that the Athletic Club is licensed 
as a club, not a restaurant, and therefore is exempt from the city no-smoking 
ordinance. There is no official nonsmoking section, she said, although we could 
be seated in the side room if the smokers were bothering us. The side room, 
however, opens onto the pool area, where the smoke was more intense than that 
from the few dining room smokers. We stayed put. The ventilation proved 
adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Athletic Club was built in 1924. While pool tables reside where 
the once-massive member's dining room used be, the Grill Room is still one of 
the great rooms in Los Angeles: Wood-paneled, with high ceilings and a 
spacious, mirrored bar, it's exactly what one expects in a sumptuous, 
old-fashioned men's club. The chairs are comfortable, the tables roomy. There's 
a good view of the bar.  
</P>
<P>
 The Grill Room provides customers with a workmanlike dining experience: The 
servers and kitchen staff, headed by chef Edward Whedbee, all do their jobs 
just fine. Except, perhaps, the big fat fresh Santa Barbara prawns grilled and 
slathered with barbecue sauce and served on a forgettable, unfortunately limp 
corn fritter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sauteed crab cakes, notably small and swimming in a tasty tomatillo salsa, 
share the fritter's fragile limpness. Decent vegetable pot stickers come with a 
pungent sherry dipping sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the salads are fresh and well-dressed and, except for the house dinner 
salad, little mere starters. Apple cider vinaigrette overly sweetens a spinach 
salad topped with chewy sun-dried tomatoes. A gingery Chinese chicken salad is 
simultaneously crunchy and quenching. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pastas are baroque, rare breeds, as if to suggest mere semolina noodles are 
too boring for this establishment: red pepper tagliatelle , black fusilli , 
basil linguine . The most plain, penne , is pleasurably crisped and served with 
an uncharacteristically dull puttanesca sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Under these tempered lights, the black fusilli , long shiny curlicue strands 
roiling with dark spinach, look like a big bowl of shiny blackberries -- what a 
surprise, then, to taste smoked Gouda, lemon, saffron and the faintly fishy 
flavor of the pasta itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grill Room's grilled items are stalwart square meals. Meat. Potatoes. 
Colorful mixed vegetables. Generally, portions are hefty -- all but the teeny, 
delicious, and therefore disappointing New Zealand lamb chops with their 
wonderful mint pesto. Free-range chicken is tender and juicy. The Kansas City 
strip steak is a huge, beautifully cooked, serious slab of not-marvelous, not 
particularly tender meat. Its categorical opposite would be Mom's Virginia meat 
loaf, which is downright fluffy. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, desserts are slow to arrive -- a fact that's important to 
consider if you're trying to make a show. But chocolate souffle cake is worth 
the wait, as is a dense, buttery lemon tart. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hollywood Athletic Club, 6525 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (213) 962-6600. Lunch 
and dinner 7 days. Full bar. Major credit cards.

HOME TECH / VIDEO: A GREAT MONTH FOR OVERLOOKED TITLES; RETAILERS ARE 
SHOWCASING MOVIES ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICANS DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shrewd video retailers have been using Black History Month -- which is 
February -- as a tool for pushing black-oriented movies, new and old. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers with significant black clienteles are showcasing classics about 
black family life, such as Paramount's "Sounder," starring Paul Winfield, and 
RCA/Columbia's "A Raisin in the Sun," featuring Sidney Poitier. These movies, 
usually buried in the classics section, often get star treatment in the front 
of the store throughout February. It's a chance for movies that are generally 
overlooked to find an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Black History Month should prove to be a boon to "Nothing but a Man," one of 
the best -- and most obscure -- movies ever made about the black community. New 
Video Group decided this is the best time for this 1964 movie, starring Ivan 
Dixon and Abbey Lincoln, to make its home video bow. It came out Wednesday, 
geared to the rental market. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, a black-and-white independent effort made for only $230,000, 
examines the black community in the early days of the civil rights movement. 
The hero, played by Dixon, is a blue-collar type struggling to survive and 
maintain dignity in a hostile world. It deals insightfully and honestly with 
black rage, a subject that most filmmakers were still skirting in the early 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it played in some theaters and was critically acclaimed, the film 
mainly as been seen in churches and schools, said Michael Roemer, who directed, 
co-wrote and co-produced "Nothing but a Man." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never been regarded as a mass-market movie," he said. "It's been on 
public television but that's all. Commercial television has considered showing 
it a few times but then ultimately decided against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Why has it taken so long to come to home video? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea," Roemer replied. "They probably didn't know how to market it. 
But New Video showed interest and saw a way to market it. Thank God for Black 
History Month." More Black History Month: "Menace II Society" came out two 
weeks ago, and "Poetic Justice," with Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur, will be 
released Wednesday. "The Meteor Man," Robert Townsend's inner-city fairy tale, 
will be in stores Feb. 9. "Laurel Avenue," the outstanding HBO miniseries about 
ghetto family life, was released Wednesday. On Feb. 16, Warner is introducing 
Spike Lee's "Malcolm X" to the sales market, pricing it at $25. 
</P>
<P>
 Orion is promoting "King," the 1978 miniseries about the life of Martin Luther 
King Jr., starring Paul Winfield. A good one-hour documentary about King, 
Xenon's "A Historical Perspective," featuring rare footage and photos, became 
available Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only the Ball Was White" (MPI, $20) is an informative half-hour documentary, 
narrated by Winfield, about the Negro baseball leagues that existed before 
black players were allowed into the major leagues in the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Videobits 
</P>
<P>
 "A Woman's View of Pro Football" (PolyGram, $20) is 45 minutes of amusing 
commentaries about the sport from women such as Ivana Trump and Joan Rivers. It 
should be a popular attraction at Super Bowl parties this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Looks like another banner year for Barney, the cuddly dinosaur. "Let's Pretend 
With Barney" is just out, with another due in March, "Barney's Alphabet Zoo." 
In addition, there will be video versions of his March shows at New York's 
Radio City Music Hall and his April TV special. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Last Action Hero" (Columbia TriStar, no set price). One of the most expensive 
(cost estimates run as high as $120 million) flops in film history. In this 
convoluted, film-within-a-film fantasy, you're often reminded that the action 
you're watching isn't real -- a bummer for real action-movie fans. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, as action-film hero Jack Slater, is clearly having fun poking 
fun at his image. Too bad the fun isn't contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coneheads" (Paramount, no set price). Feeling nostalgic for the Coneheads 
bits from the early "Saturday Night Live" shows? Then whatever you do, don't 
rent this movie -- it'll destroy all those fond memories. Dan Aykroyd and Jane 
Curtin, who starred in the old skits, are reunited as the coneheaded, 
robot-like aliens who make bumbling attempts at being average Americans. Mostly 
juvenile humor that may have some appeal to the subteen and early teen set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hard Target" (MCA/Universal, no set price). This classy action movie -- 
kick-boxing star Jean-Claude Van Damme's best ever -- showcases the skills of 
Hong Kong director John Woo, who's making his Hollywood debut. The hero is 
pitted against a decadent sportsman (Lance Henriksen) who arranges human-prey 
safaris for millionaires. It's the umpteenth rip-off of 1932's "The Most 
Dangerous Game" -- but so what? The plot merely serves to kill time between the 
great action sequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rookie of the Year" (FoxVideo, no set price). In his directorial debut, 
Daniel Stern, who overdoes it playing the pitching coach, doesn't miss a cliche 
in this comedy about a 12-year-old boy (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who mysteriously 
develops a blazing fastball and becomes a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs. Despite 
a procession of stereotypes, it's entertaining hokum that manages to keep you 
interested -- right down to the inevitable ninth-inning finale. Gary Busey 
co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 Just announced: Touchstone's "What's Love Got to Do With It," the Tina Turner 
biography starring Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne, due March 23. 
HBO/Savoy's "A Bronx Tale," directed by and featuring Robert De Niro, comes out 
April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Also: "Kalifornia" and "Indochine" (Wednesday); "In the Line of Fire," 
"Amongst Friends," "The Real McCoy" and "That Night" (Feb. 9); "The Secret 
Garden" (Feb. 15); "Man Without a Face," "The Program" and "Calendar Girl"

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: AN ENGAGING TRIBUTE TO PERRY COMO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the impact of Elvis Presley and the rock revolution in the second half 
of the '50s, traditional pop singers -- from Nat (King) Cole to Frank Sinatra 
-- remained major sales forces in pop music during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 Of them, Perry Como -- the former barber from Pennsylvania who sang in a 
relaxed crooning style that was greatly influenced by Bing Crosby and Russ 
Columbo -- was the hottest on the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 The hits from the late '50s were just part of a remarkable string that began 
with "Goodbye, Sue," his first RCA single in 1943, and lasted into the '70s, 
when he made it onto the charts with such songs as Don McLean's "And I Love You 
So." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Como's signature singles: "Till the End of Time," which spent 10 weeks 
at No. 1 in 1945; "If," which was No. 1 for eight weeks in 1951, and "It's 
Impossible," which reached No. 10 on the charts in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Those recordings are among the 71 selections contained in "Perry Como: 
Yesterday and Today -- A Celebration in Song," a three-disc boxed set from RCA 
that contains four previously unreleased tracks and a colorful 74-page booklet 
with an essay by rock historian Colin Escott about the singer's colorful 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 As the music here shows, Como was a man of considerable vocal ability, but he 
was, perhaps intentionally, a modest stylist. When Sinatra recorded a song by, 
say Cole Porter, the challenge for him, one sensed, was to come up with an 
interpretation that was all his own. He aimed for phrasing that surprised and 
delighted. 
</P>
<P>
 For Como, the challenge appears to have been quite different. When he 
approached a song -- including Porter's "I Concentrate on You" and "Begin the 
Beguine," both of which are included in the set -- the goal was to sing it in 
an everyman way that enabled you to sing along effortlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 It's this relaxed style -- which also carried over into his manner and public 
persona -- that made Como such a TV favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 If that television exposure contributed greatly in the '50s to Como's 
continued popularity, he also benefited from a willingness to sing material 
that was in keeping with the commercial trends of the day -- even if that 
material sometimes made him wince. 
</P>
<P>
 As Escott writes in his liner notes, Como -- who was born in 1912, nine years 
after his parents arrived in the United States from Italy -- is quick to 
acknowledge that many of the songs that became big hits were ones he didn't 
want to record. "I'd tell the A&R man, 'I can't sing that garbage,' and he'd 
say, 'Just do one take -- one take for me.' I'd say, 'I'm gonna get ill if I do 
two.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Escott identifies an ersatz polka called "Hoop-Dee-Doo" as the first song Como 
hated to record, but it went to No. 1 in 1950 -- and one can imagine Como 
frowning later over such novelties as the rock-flavored "Hot Diggity (Dog 
Ziggity Boom)" and the horribly corny "Wild Horses." 
</P>
<P>
 There are some curious omissions in the set, including "Wanted," which was No. 
1 for eight weeks in 1954. Mostly, however, the set is an engaging tribute to a 
singer who for more than a quarter century made singing along an invitation 
that few pop fans could resist.

THEATER BEAT: ELEGANTLY CRAFTED TALE OF DOOMED LOVE AT THE COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A superstitious film producer believes it's bad luck to face a bed north. But 
hustlers make strange bedfellows, especially if a casual assignation leads to 
commitment. When the producer invites the man who came to dinner into his 
bedroom, more than a bed gets turned around at the Court Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 David Knapp's "A Bed Facing North" is an elegantly crafted tale of doomed love 
between a conservative older man and a promiscuous youth. Despite the tragic 
context, its exceptional writing, acting and directing make this gay love story 
unexpectedly funny and poignant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this is Knapp's first play, he's a veteran actor and producer with an 
obvious love of the theater and a gift for sophisticated dialogue. There's not 
a single hint that the text is influenced by film or television dramas. "A Bed 
Facing North" is the real thing: authentically observed experience dramatically 
revealed on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is supported beautifully by Granville Van Dusen as the cautious 
professional Doug who until recently maintained a low profile in the gay world. 
"You're a closet heterosexual," says his latest lover, and Doug admits that he 
preferred the pre-gay liberation days "when everyone was still in the closet." 
Van Dusen portrays the cynical industry executive like he's an Oscar Wilde of 
the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Stapleton is the Dorian Gray to Van Dusen's Wilde. As the voracious male 
hustler without a conscience, Stapleton shrewdly offers no clues. Is he a 
sociopath? A guide into the sensual underground of gay L.A.? Alternately 
seductive and pathetic, always complex, this "free spirit" exhibits minimal 
guilt while casually breaking hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kid Self-Destructive collides with Mr. Self-Protective. "I'm immoral," Doug 
says. " You're amoral." 
</P>
<P>
 But the truth, as the producer reluctantly admits, is that the Adonis he 
worships is an enigma. "Not to know him is to know him," he sadly discovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting cast is first-rate, especially David Sessions as the dimwitted 
"stoner" and Paul Haber as an uptight screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Problematic performances are given by the cast's token women -- Marianne 
McAndrew, Eleanor Comegys, Deborah Seidel -- not because of their work, which 
is impressive, but because of their peripheral, expositional characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The female characters emerge still-born from the literary tradition of "all 
women are either Madonnas or whores." McAndrew is required to portray the 
mother from hell. Comegys is the tolerant, sensitive, self-sacrificing 
girlfriend who accepts her part-time boyfriend's bisexuality without fear or 
anger. This is more than dubious behavior on her part. It's wishful thinking on 
a male's part. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed with wit and wisdom by Stewart Moss in a spare presentational style 
on a minimal set, "A Bed Facing North" resembles intimate confessional plays 
such as "Blue Window" by Craig Lucas or "Three Hotels" by Jon Robin Baitz. It 
contains the ethical impact of those minor masterpieces, and has the potential 
-- with judicious editing -- to belong in their league. As it is now, Knapp's 
play is a compelling, haunting ode to love in the turning years. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Bed Facing North," Court Theatre, 722 North La Cienega Blvd., West 
Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sunday matinees, 3 p.m. Ends Feb. 20. 
$16-$20. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes. 'Lulu' Captures 
Essence of Brooks 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Brooks, the legendary star of the silent film "Pandora's Box," is 
vividly resurrected in the cabaret-styled "Yours, Lulu -- Broadway to Berlin" 
at Theatre/ Theater. Pamela Shafer's physical resemblance to the cinema's first 
femme fatale ends with the trademark "helmet hair," but Shafer still manages to 
evoke Brooks' primal persona. There's an elusive, coy, intriguing mystery that 
Shafer has somehow caught. This isn't done with smoke and mirrors, but with 
style, music and audacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Shafer is accompanied by pianist-composer Charles Geyer, who portrays a 
variety of significant others in Brooks' erratic career while adding original 
Sondheim-influenced tunes. Shafer has a strong stage presence, and quickly 
adopts the numerous roles, particularly critic Kenneth Tynan, who rediscovered 
the secluded, forgotten actress at the end of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Tynan's obsession with the screen image of Lulu, the temptress in "Pandora's 
Box," led to a famous New Yorker article. His biographical material provides 
the evening's narrative spine, but the fragmented style of Shafer-Geyer's 
script (co-written with director John Moser) leads to dramatic confusion, 
especially in a pretentious opening sequence designed to create an image of 
Brooks as an eternal archetype. 
</P>
<P>
 But the melodramatic plot isn't why audiences watch "Pandora's Box," nor is 
story why we might care about this "Lulu." Brooks was feminine before feminism, 
an enchantress who hypnotized without guile, and at Theatre/Theater her ghost 
still casts a spell. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Yours, Lulu -- Broadway to Berlin," Theatre/Theater, 1713 Cahuenga Blvd., 
Hollywood. Thursdays-Fridays, 8 p.m. Ends Feb. 18. $12. (213) 469-9689. Running 
time: 1 hour, 45 minutes. Solid One-Acts at Playwright's Arena 
</P>
<P>
 Playwrights' Arena is celebrating its first year of existence with a festival 
of promising one acts, divided into two presentations of three works. In the 
Freeway Series, Martin Shea's "Life of the Theater" is an extended sketch about 
an escapee from a psychiatric hospital who poses as a playwright. Its absurdity 
never rises to the level of farce that the material demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Gersten's "Willie Said To," however, is an impeccably performed, 
tough-minded play about a black tutor's struggles to educate ghetto kids. And 
Lisa Loomer's "Chain of Life" confirms the Los Angeles theater community's 
excitement about her unique playwriting voice. Here, Loomer satirizes the 
psychic wasteland left by a television-dominated culture, employing the 
episodic style that makes the medium such a dangerous message. 
</P>
<P>
 * Playwrights' Arena First Annual Festival of One Acts, 5262 Pico Blvd., Los 
Angeles. Freeway Series (Bill B), Tonight, 8 p.m., Sunday 2 & 8 p.m. Ends 
Sunday. Running time: 3 hours. A Fine, Fast Staging of Orton's 'Butler' 
</P>
<P>
 The times seem to have caught up with Joe Orton. 
</P>
<P>
 Over two decades after his death, British bad boy Orton continues to shock and 
insult polite society, this time around in a respectable revival of "What the 
Butler Saw" at Theatre 40. Director Bruce Gray wisely propels his superior 
ensemble through the farce as if everyone's late for the last train out of 
Bosnia, and in Orton's psychiatric hospital that's appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Orton's numerous epigrams remain astonishingly current, while the cultural 
changes now allow us to view his "scandalous" themes as almost conventional 
behavior. The fine cast is anchored by Marcus Smythe and Robin Groves as the 
psychiatrist and his Mrs., whose bickering feud and compromised marriage make 
perfect sense today. 
</P>
<P>
 * "What the Butler Saw," Theatre 40, 241 Moreno Drive, Beverly Hills. 
Sundays-Tuesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Feb. 8. $10. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 2 
hours. Vivid Is One Thing This 'Life' Is Not 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe her life is too vivid for Carol Metcalf, but it's not for an audience 
witnessing her demonstration of limited range and unlimited ambition. Metcalf's 
autobiographical showcase at the St. Genesius Theatre, "My Life Is Too Vivid," 
is hopefully cathartic for the performer, since she imitates a variety of 
family members from her Texas childhood. Unfortunately, her exorcisms blur 
together. Fundamentalist Christians resemble ex-Playboy bunnies and vitamin 
therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Life Is Too Vivid" vividly demonstrates that truth is sometimes duller 
than fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 * "My Life Is Too Vivid," St. Genesius Theatre, 1047 N. Havenhurst Ave., West 
Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 10 p.m. (through Feb. 5), Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 
p.m. (Feb. 10-13 only). Ends Feb. 13. $5-$10. (213) 650-7808. Running time: 1 
hour, 30 minutes.

ATTRACTION REVIEW; DISNEY SPINS A CAR TOON TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin," a new ride that opened Wednesday at 
Disneyland, uses black lights, strobe lights, three-dimensional 
"audio-animatronic" figures, cut-outs, mirrors, sound effects and music to 
evoke detective Eddie Valiant's madcap visit to Toontown in the 1988 hit movie, 
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 Entering through a "backstage" area that recalls the Maroon Cartoon Studio, 
visitors walk past dressing rooms for Jessica Rabbit and Baby Herman. Bongo, 
the gorilla-bouncer, scowls through the peephole in the door of the Ink and 
Paint Club. (He doesn't respond to "Walt sent me," the password in the film.) 
</P>
<P>
 The ride actually begins when visitors board a small version of Benny the Cab 
for a three-minute, 20-second sound-and-light show that suggests a noisier 
version of Alice in Wonderland or Mr. Toad's Wild Ride in Fantasyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The bright yellow cars chase one another through a series of cartoon scenes 
that include a mad scientist's lab and a china shop, complete with bull. 
Entering a chamber filled with angular graphics that simulate a cartoon 
"explosion" feels a bit like driving into a Roy Lichtenstein painting; it's 
followed by the requisite stars and little birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers try to keep their cab facing in the direction they're heading by 
spinning the steering wheel (it's tougher than it sounds) as they bounce and 
jerk along, avoiding weasels armed with barrels of the deadly Dip that 
terrifies Toons. (A sign lists the formula as equal parts of benzine, 
turpentine and acetone.) 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Rabbit finally comes to the rescue with a portable hole, a gag borrowed 
from the Robert McKimson short "The Whole Idea" (Warner Bros., 1955). 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fast and funny trip, but it doesn't really capture the look of 
Toontown. The sequence in the film re-created the rubbery elan of the 
Fleischer, MGM and Warner Bros. cartoons of the early '30s.  
</P>
<P>
 The characters (and, often, the backgrounds) in those shorts were drawn with a 
rambunctious elasticity: Noses and limbs could be stretched at will; faces 
appeared on inanimate objects, and characters casually metamorphosed. Anything 
could and did happen in those surreal films. 
</P>
<P>
 The brightly colored, jointed figures in "Car Toon Spin" suggest the elegant 
animation of the Disney features on other rides, but Toontown should feel like 
it's made out of Silly Putty, rather than wood and concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 This caveat aside -- and the proviso that small children may find the 
experience a little too noisy and frenetic -- anyone 5 or older will probably 
enjoy "Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin." 
</P>
<P>
 * General admission to Disneyland is $24 to $30; $22 for Southern California 
residents (through June). (714) 999-4565.

$50 MILLION RELEASED FOR ROAD REPAIRS; REBUILDING: INFUSION OF FEDERAL FUNDS 
WILL ALLOW RECONSTRUCTION TO CONTINUE AROUND THE CLOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration released $50 million in emergency earthquake 
assistance Thursday to keep construction crews working around the clock to 
clear debris and repair damaged highways in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want them to stop for a second," Transportation Secretary Federico 
Pena told a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing. "We want to 
provide funding to allow them to continue reconstruction" of the major highway 
structures damaged in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement brings the amount of transportation money provided for 
emergency repairs to $95 million since the Northridge quake. Under federal law 
a maximum $100 million in emergency funds is available until Congress approves 
the Administration's $6.6-billion aid package for quake victims. The package 
includes $1.35 billion to repair roads and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, called by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Pena said 
arrangements were being made to add 25 locomotives and train cars to 
accommodate commuters riding the Metrolink system. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said he was also working on securing federal waivers to increase the 
average speed of Metrolink trains from 25 m.p.h. to 30 m.p.h. on the route 
between Palmdale and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pena emphasized that the long-term plan to rebuild the Los Angeles area's 
transportation network must include efforts to persuade as many commuters as 
possible to park their cars and use mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridership on the Metrolink system has jumped since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are asking the people to reconsider their transportation alternatives," 
Pena said. "We have to find a way in this process to ensure that when 
construction is finished this ridership is maintained." 
</P>
<P>
 Pena estimated that it would take six months to a year to rebuild damaged 
highways, which he called a vital link in "restoring the flow of commerce from 
the Pacific Coast to the rest of the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, the Senate Public Works Committee passed on a voice vote 
Boxer's proposal that would make highway bridges eligible for federal funds to 
cover earthquake retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, a freeway structure must be damaged before it is eligible 
for federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the proposal would not set aside any federal money to retrofit 
California freeways, Boxer called it a necessary first step. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer said she and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) are optimistic that 
California House Republicans will not delay an effort to quickly pass the 
$6.6-billion aid package by insisting that the spending be offset by budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both California senators were assured by Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) that 
Congress does not regard the earthquake as a California problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a problem we have to face as a nation. We have to get ready. There 
will be more earthquakes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week the Senate will assess relief operations by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development at a 
committee hearing called by Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.).

HIGHWAY PILEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I don't understand why a 70-car pileup in the fog makes the front page (Jan. 
16). It happens so often it isn't news anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing unusual is that we have so many idiots doing it over and over, 
following one another into the fog like highway lemmings. 
</P>
<P>
 If you asked them to drive blindfolded at 60 miles per hour they would think 
you were crazy. Yet this is exactly what they do when they speed into a fog. 
</P>
<P>
 Some highways have crosses by the side of the road to indicate where a fatal 
accident has occurred. For the highway lemmings we should pile all the wrecked 
vehicles in one heap as a monument to stupidity.

THE ATROCITY OF THE FOOD WEAPON; WILL WEST CONTINUE TO LET THE BOSNIANS BE 
STARVED BY THEIR GENOCIDAL FOES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnia is starving. On Tuesday, the United Nations confirmed numbers reported 
by Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic: During December, people in 
Bosnian-controlled territory got about 5.5 pounds of U.N.-delivered food each. 
In Serb-controlled territory in Bosnia, people got more than nine pounds. In 
Croat-controlled territory, 21 pounds. A U.N. official attributed the 
discrepancy to Serbian and Croatian military superiority: U.N. food is a weapon 
that the Serbs and Croats had been using aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian and Croatian interference with U.N. relief deliveries to the Bosnians 
has been ratcheted up sharply during the last three months in a patent attempt 
to force the Bosnians to accept the partition of their country that has been 
urged upon them by the European Union and the United Nations itself. The 
Bosnians are asked to trust, with no evidence, that if they agree to a 
partition the West will enforce it. They have declined to agree, maintaining 
bitterly that the suspension of U.N. relief shipments to central Bosnia at the 
instigation of U.N. peace negotiator Thorvald Stoltenberg shows U.N. complicity 
in the effort to force Bosnia's hand.  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the U.N. intentions, the effect is clear: Bosnia is starving, and 
panic is beginning to set in. On Wednesday, a relief convoy passing through 
central Bosnia under government escort was set upon by a desperate mob. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO has promised air strikes should Bosnia be threatened with 
"strangulation," and on Tuesday Britain, France and the United States called on 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali to press ahead with planning for the strikes. The U.N. 
secretary general has not done so, however; and on Wednesday, to keep up the 
pressure on him, President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur of France went a step further. Rather than just call for air strikes, 
they insisted that the United Nations had the authority to call for NATO troops 
to relieve the besieged towns of Tuzla and Srebenica. 
</P>
<P>
 The American response to the French statement has been confused. Though 
President Clinton has stressed that great harm will be done if the NATO threat 
proves idle, the State Department has bitterly criticized the French demands on 
the illogical ground that the proposed partition of Bosnia is unacceptable. The 
peace proposal is indeed unacceptable, and the American demand that NATO ground 
troops in Bosnia be European remains reasonable. But these positions can be 
distinguished from support for a proposal to militarily guarantee relief 
deliveries and so avert impending genocide. 
</P>
<P>
 France deserves credit for holding NATO to its word and the United Nations to 
some accountability. President Clinton should recognize that his own 
credibility will suffer as much as that of NATO or the United Nations if this 
proposal falls to American sniping.

CONTROLLING THE GUN EPIDEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades one could correctly assume that, just like clockwork, the nation's 
annual motor-vehicle death toll would surpass the previous year's. But since 
1968 fatalities have dropped by more than 21%.Experts credit safety innovations 
and tougher legislation in that period, and they estimate that 250,000 lives 
have been spared, even though traffic accidents remain the leading cause of 
death by injury in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing from that success, a report issued by the federal Department of Health 
and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control urges that a similar 
systematic approach be taken in dealing with another serious health menace: gun 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such an approach, the study warns, deaths from gunshots will outpace 
deaths from traffic accidents within the next decade. Unfortunately, that's 
already the case in seven states, California among them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sad that even though there have been more than 280,000 gun homicides 
since 1968 -- and thousands of additional accidents and suicides involving 
firearms -- many elected officials in Washington and Sacramento continue to be 
intimidated by the politics of the gun issue. 
</P>
<P>
 What's needed is public education, safety devices and firearm regulation 
through legislation. That's not an easy proposition, given the 210 million 
firearms in circulation -- and given the powerful and well-financed gun lobby. 
But America has got to stop shooting itself, in more than just the foot.

IRAN-CONTRA REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with regret the comments of former Presidents Reagan and Bush to 
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's report on the Iran-Contra affair (Jan. 
19). I was especially appalled by Bush's notion that the Iran-Contra scandal 
was merely "a political dispute between the executive and legislative branches 
over foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Boland amendments, imperfect as they may have been, were the law of the 
United States, both having been passed by Congress over the President's veto. 
Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress alone has the power to 
"make all laws." No court ever ruled the amendments unconstitutional. In such a 
case, Article II, Section 4 clearly states that the President shall "take care 
that the laws be faithfully executed." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of executing the laws, the Reagan Administration used its influence in 
a deliberate scheme to encourage citizens to skirt them. The role of the Reagan 
Administration in deliberately avoiding faithful enforcement of the laws of the 
United States is clearly a violation of the President's oath of office, as well 
as the oath of each officer of the executive branch (including military 
officers), each of whom swore to faithfully execute his office and preserve, 
protect and defend the Constitution. It also violated several criminal 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 While President Reagan, and members of his Administration, could have lobbied 
Congress to change the law, once it was enacted, the President had a solemn 
responsibility to which he had sworn. In the case of the Boland amendments, 
that is exactly what President Reagan and then Vice President Bush together 
with Messrs. Casey, North, Poindexter and crew failed to do. This is not merely 
a political question. It is and must be a legal question. And it could be 
criminal.

Jan. 22). 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh spent seven years and $35 million and was unable to indict anyone of 
crime. Failing that, he issues a report which slanders nearly every officer of 
the Reagan presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans historically have felt an individual innocent until proven guilty. 
Evidently suspicion is all we need today. It is questionable that this report 
should have ever been released, but to endorse it celebrates mendacious 
behavior.

 The risk is that honorable men may refuse public office if this is to be their 
reward.

just like old times! 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Walsh, the special prosecutor of Iran-Contra, says Reagan and Bush 
knew about everything and are guilty, he admits he has no evidence -- no 
evidence after eight years and $35 million of taxpayers' money, and the 
Democrats are still digging.

 * Cal Thomas' article (Column Right, Jan. 20) is full of omissions and 
inaccuracies. He neglects to mention that the Nicaraguan Contras actually 
committed more human-rights abuses than the Sandinista government. He also 
neglects to mention that Walsh did in fact prosecute Oliver North in a court of 
law and won convictions for charges including drafting misleading letters to 
Congress. Therefore Walsh's use of North's name at his press conference was not 
a "smear" and was not unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, his reference to the Reagan Administration as "principled men who 
loved freedom" needs to be closely examined. These men did not value freedom, 
just capitalism. Reagan's foreign policy indicates that he was willing to 
tolerate dictators, just as long as they were right-wing dictators.

CLINTON HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was pleased to see the articles on Jan. 22 concerning the Clinton health 
care plan. I share President Clinton's desire to provide health care for the 
American public. Everyone would like to see health care costs managed more 
efficiently. Most individuals would also like to see affordable health 
insurance made available to anyone that would desire to purchase it. I, 
however, am absolutely not in favor of the mandates in the President's plan, 
which call for setting up health care alliances, a board to determine the "fair 
price" for new innovation, and forced coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 We have the greatest system in the entire world. We should improve it, not 
scrap it. The President's plan, which would ultimately end in health care 
rationing and the likelihood of a huge increase in costs, will fail miserably 
in providing excellent health care to the citizens of the United States.

<P>
 * In response to "Raise Quality by Lowering Costs," Commentary, Jan. 17: 
</P>
<P>
 The writers make some good points. However, they are way off base in their 
claim that "the only way to reduce the total social cost of illness and its 
treatment is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of care delivery." 
Improvement of care delivery is by no means "the only way" to reduce the total 
cost of illness. There is huge bureaucratic waste in the way the insurance 
companies and hospitals operate. Two studies indicate that tremendous savings 
would be achieved if the 1,500 health insurance companies, which deliver no 
actual health services whatever, were disengaged from any role in the health 
field. A 1992 study by the General Accounting Office concluded that the U.S. 
would save $67 billion if it adopted a single-payer, Canadian-style health 
system. On Aug. 5, 1993, the New England Journal of Medicine reported on a 
study which projected 25 cents of every health dollar would be spent of 
paperwork and that $232 billion of the $940 billion spent on health care in 
1993 would be used for administrative purposes. It estimated that we would save 
$117 billion annually if a single-payer system were adopted.

TELLY SAVALAS

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Actor Telly Savalas is still alive on a 747 en route to New York from LAX, 
in my mind (" 'Kojak' Star Telly Savalas Dies at 70," Jan. 23). A few years 
ago, while traveling first class with his wife and new baby, Savalas' credit 
card stubbornly refused to trigger a call from the in-flight phone behind the 
cockpit.Noting his quiet frustration, I tried my credit card. It did work. So I 
turned the phone over him.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, Mama! It's Telly!" he gushed. I walked away. Later, when I returned to 
make a call myself, Savalas quietly extended a clenched fist. It was stuffed 
with bills. I told him I couldn't accept the cash and not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
 Kojack's final words still ring in my ears. 
</P>

 "I owe you," he said, as we parted.

BIGOTRY IS IMMORAL, NO MATTER WHO EXPRESSES IT; RACE RELATIONS: AFRICAN 
AMERICANS MUST REJECT ANTI-SEMITISM FROM ONE OF THEIR OWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE R. JONES, Elaine R. Jones is director-counsel of the NAACP Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 History teaches that the seeds of demagoguery take root in desperate times. 
For many African Americans, these are such times. Hyper-segregated black 
communities are plagued by high unemployment and economic devastation, by the 
double scourge of drugs and violence, by governmental and private-sector 
neglect and by the persistence of racism. Tempted by the demons of frustration 
and bitterness, some in the black community are giving voice to bigotry and 
anti-Semitic sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 In late November, at a state college in New Jersey, such an individual 
delivered a speech, full of factual and historical misrepresentations, that 
vilified Jews, white people and black people who associated with them. The 
speaker, the Nation of Islam's Khalid Abdul Mohammad, denounced Nelson Mandela 
because of his vision of multiracial post-apartheid South Africa and called for 
the death of every white man, woman and child who had the temerity to remain in 
that country. The diatribe also contained remarks offensive to Jews, Catholics, 
Italians, Greeks and Arabs, as well as African Americans who do not think in 
the prescribed manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the significance of the speech at Kean College will not be found 
in its substance, but in our response to it. There are those in the African 
American community who may find the speech repugnant but are reluctant to 
publicly break rank with those who preach racial pride and self-reliance. 
Others may resent being held collectively and personally accountable for the 
statements of an individual with whom they have nothing in common other than 
ethnicity. Some believe that a speech insulting so many people in such an 
outrageously vile and ignorant manner should not be underscored by more 
attention than it deserves, while still others do not see why its anti-Semitism 
should be singled out for special response. Finally, some resent what they 
perceive to be patronizing pressure to repudiate views that they would reject 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the merits of these positions, reasonable people cannot disagree on 
this fact: The message of racism, anti-Semitism and hatred delivered at Kean 
College must be condemned. We who work daily to eliminate the blight of bigotry 
know that in the struggle against racism, we cannot ourselves become racist. As 
African Americans, we oppose bigotry not simply because we historically have 
been its victims; we oppose it because it is morally wrong. If we are to 
condemn racism, we must condemn it no matter who the victims are or who the 
perpetrators may be. If we want others to denounce racism when African 
Americans are its target, we must be equally indignant and outspoken when 
others are its victims. Our struggle goes beyond self-interest; it is a 
struggle for what is right. 
</P>
<P>
 We must move beyond condemnation, however, to a meaningful dialogue about 
racism, anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry. We must then move beyond 
dialogue to attack the conditions of poverty and isolation that produce the 
frustration and bitterness that provide such fertile soil for the seeds of 
divisiveness. As long as so many African Americans are profoundly alienated 
from mainstream America, the rhetoric of bigotry and hatred will resonate among 
some. 
</P>
<P>
 We must call upon the better angels of our nature to realize Dr. King's vision 
of a society in which "black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants 
and Catholics" can join together in a celebration of freedom. Let us meet on 
the high road of racial and religious tolerance and mutual respect. Only there 
can we transform Dr. King's vision into reality.

PERSPECTIVES ON REBUILDING; SOMEONE HAS TO PAY FOR IT; IF LANDLORDS CAN'T RAISE 
RENTS TO FIX OR MAINTAIN PROPERTIES, SANTA MONICA MAY NOT HAVE ANY PLACES LEFT 
TO RENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN, Sam Hall Kaplan, an urban designer and critic whose books 
include L.A. Lost & Found and L.A. Follies, is an owner-occupant of a four-unit 
Santa Monica apartment complex. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beyond establishing new building codes in the aftermath of last week's 
earthquake, what if the building to be repaired or replaced exceeded the zoning 
standards? Do we reduce the density of new housing and require more parking? 
Won't this exacerbate the housing shortage? Will this penalize former tenants 
and persevering owners, and compromise rent control? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect quick answers, certainly not in Santa Monica where a bumbling 
City Council takes decades to debate the simplest planning issues.  
</P>
<P>
 And what about the surviving housing stock? Isn't it time to begin periodic 
housing and building inspections of all units in and about Los Angeles in 
anticipation of the next quake sure to come? But in addition to the substandard 
apartments, wouldn't this also expose the estimated 100,000 illegal units, 
bootlegged apartments and converted garages that provide needed affordable 
housing? 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the question of paying for all this repairing and rebuilding. 
That is if the owners don't simply throw in the towel, collect what insurance 
they can and walk away from the property, as some are threatening to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with low- or no-interest federal disaster loans, the money to amortize 
the loans will have to come from somewhere. A rent increase would seem the 
obvious source. But that won't be easy or simple, especially in Santa Monica. 
There, rents are calculated not on the size, condition or location of the 
apartment, but rather on what was charged for it in April, 1978, plus an 
arbitrary annual adjustment, which, given the politics of the rent-control 
board, has been miserly. Various studies have put rents in Santa Monica at 30% 
to 50% below fair market value, when compared to, say, neighboring Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the tenant-dominated board and a compliant council, it also has 
been near impossible for landlords to get rent increases to cover such 
maintenance items as roof repairs, termite treatment and plumbing replacements. 
According to some landlords, the deferred maintenance has compromised the 
structural integrity of the buildings, and was one of the reasons the city's 
apartment stock was so badly damaged in the quake, despite the distance from 
the epicenter. More than 3,100 of the city's estimated 28,000 units so far have 
been declared unsafe and vacated. 
</P>
<P>
 That it had to take a mean, costly earthquake to expose the fallacy and 
failure of rent control is unfortunate, particularly in Santa Monica where its 
enforcement was so pernicious. But perhaps now, faced with the urgent need to 
serve its tenant constituency, or lose them, the city will at long last 
recognize the reality and rights of landlords and make the obvious needed 
repairs to a damaged rent-control program. 
</P>
<P>
 If Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Los Angeles and other quake-damaged cities 
are to be repaired and rebuilt, they are going to need landlords. Political 
rhetoric won't pay the bills.

<P>
 You sit in the dark waiting for the cataclysm. When you have spent so much 
time and invested so much passion creating a room -- waxing wood, putting 
tulips in a vase, setting turquoise bowls just so, vacuuming until the lines of 
furniture leap out from their place -- how do you feel when this work is 
nullified by destruction? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a disaster is really just the compression of minute eruptions you 
experience over weeks, months and years into one intense moment. Absent the 
dramatic catastrophe, how do you look at the small day-to-day ruin -- the 
earthquake that occurs when you lie; the mudslide when you are petty or gossip 
or treat someone with contempt; the fire when you are silent in the face of 
someone else's humiliation, or worse, when you are the instrument of that 
humiliation; the flood of meaningless, mindless chatter, empty activity. 
</P>
<P>
 These disasters strike with the relentlessness of nature -- human nature. We 
are blind to what is important until, in our darkest hour, our own 4:31 a.m., 
we are shaken awake and, realizing the great catastrophe unfolding, cry out, "I 
am not prepared," or "I am afraid," or "I do not have the tools to survive 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 I have surrounded myself with objects from the past that hold more than a 
passing fascination for me, yet I have failed to investigate this fascination. 
I have been delighted with the play of light on a table, yet have failed to 
learn deeply about light and shadow and why light rules moods. I have spent 
time with people who suffocate me and have returned to them again and again. I 
have not questioned who I am or what I want, and yet this 4:31 a.m. approaches, 
more rapidly now. The shuddering and shaking and wrenching begins. The 
structure is moving off its foundation.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PANEL BACKS LIQUOR SALE AT ARTS PLAZA

 The concessionaire who wins the right to sell food and drinks to patrons at 
the Civic Arts Plaza should be allowed to offer hard liquor as well as wine and 
beer, the Thousand Oaks theaters commission has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city will select the menu and set the prices, an outside contractor 
will provide snacks and beverages during intermissions.The concessionaire -- 
who will be chosen after a competitive bid process -- will be allowed to apply 
for a hard liquor license. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want their vodka," Commissioner Larry Janss said. 
</P>
<P>
 The theaters' executive director, Tom Mitze, said that in his years of 
experience with performing arts centers, he has never seen an audience member 
get drunk during intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time we had anyone inebriated, he came that way," Mitze said. "I'm a 
white wine man myself, but I have no problem with mixed drinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners Julian McDonald and Larry Sparrow dissented in the 5-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparrow voiced concerns about the city's potential liability if patrons got 
drunk while attending a performance. McDonald said he thought that bartenders 
would not have enough time to serve mixed drinks during a short intermission.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PLAN OKD TO PRESERVE RUSTIC 
ATMOSPHERE

 An extensive blueprint for the future of Thousand Oaks that would limit 
development and preserve the city's semirural atmosphere has passed review by 
the City Council, moving the two-year project a step closer to completion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council reviewed the Comprehensive General Plan on 
Tuesday night and agreed to forward it to the Planning Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar, who worked on the committee that formulated the plan, 
said she was pleased with its progress, despite a continuing struggle between 
pro-growth adherents and those wishing to preserve a semirural atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a small town. It's a city of 110,000 people. But we have a strong 
desire to maintain a rural feeling," Lazar said. "It's always been a balancing 
act." 
</P>
<P>
 The general plan touches on a wide range of issues, including the widening of 
streets, the protection of undeveloped land, preservation of special zones for 
ranch-style homes with horse stables, and height restrictions on buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was not fully endorsed by every council member Tuesday, but the 
council agreed to discuss the fine points at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not totally in favor of all of the recommendations, but I didn't want to 
stop the process," said Councilman Alex Fiore. "I will take on the specific 
issues when they come back to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah said future debate probably will be focused on zoning 
changes that reduce the number of units that can be built on certain 
properties. But she said she believes the current version, as a total plan, 
will satisfy most Thousand Oaks residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were surprised that there seemed to be such community consensus about the 
vision of the city and how it should look in 20 more years," Zeanah said after 
the meeting. "We feel the way we've drafted this plan is reflective of the 
community's goals." MATTHEW MOSK

SPIRIT OF THE OLD WEST; PAINTINGS BY EARLY 20TH-CENTURY ILLUSTRATOR W.H.D. 
KOERNER AT THE GENE AUTRY MUSEUM CAPTURE FEELING OF FRONTIER AND VITALITY OF 
PIONEERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the first trappers, traders and miners moved across this continent in 
the early 1800s, artists have followed to record heartfelt, stirring 
impressions of the American West. Frederic Remington and Charles Rus sell are 
probably the most widely known and celebrated Western artists. But, there have 
been others who have contributed to our understanding of life in the West's 
mountains, deserts and plains. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early part of this century, W.H.D. Koerner was an illustrator for 
magazines of the day such as the Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and Ladies 
Home Journal. In 1922, the Saturday Evening Post asked him to illustrate a 
serialized short story by Emerson Hough, "The Covered Wagon." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus began a continual stream of Western story illustrations by Koerner 
(1878-1938), who would base his images on first-hand knowledge. After the 
success of "The Covered Wagon," Koerner made several trips from his New Jersey 
home -- often with his wife, daughter and son -- through different areas of the 
West, taking in and making sketches of everything from cattle drives to Indian 
customs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 of the paintings he did to illustrate the Saturday Evening Post's 
Western stories are on view at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in the 
exhibit, "The Art of W.H.D. Koerner." That show shares the George Montgomery 
Gallery with the "Hubbard Collection of Western Art." It includes two 
immaculately detailed, larger-than-life contemporary bronze sculptures of 
Plains Indians by Dave McGary of New Mexico, works by Remington and Russell's 
last major works: two panoramic murals, each more than 20 feet long, conveying 
"The History of the West I and II." 
</P>
<P>
 "Daddy sure used color in his paintings," said Santa Barbara resident Ruth 
Koerner Oliver, the artist's daughter, who made her first trip West with her 
father in 1924 when she was 11. "Some of those artists in the early days just 
worked in black and white because the paintings were reproduced in black and 
white in those magazines. But daddy always worked on the large canvas and used 
oil for all the color. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a sense of complementary color working. If you see a red, you'll 
see a green right next to it. If you see a blue, you'll see an orange. And his 
horses are not brown or black -- they're a shade of orange which is really 
brown. The highlights on the horse are not white, they're blue. So the orange 
and blue -- that's the complementary part." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver has been instrumental in organizing shows of her father's work in 
museums around the country for 30 years. The paintings, sketches and magazine 
covers on display here are from her collection and that of her son, Fal Oliver 
Jr.  
</P>
<P>
 The Koerner collection "is one we've been familiar with through Ruth Koerner 
Oliver," said Michael Duchemin, the Autry's history curator, emphasizing that 
many of Koerner's paintings present non-stereotypical images of the West. Among 
works of homesteaders, wagons moving west and pioneer women are scenes 
depicting Indian and early Spanish California life. The Indian and California 
compositions, such as the illustrations for the 1932 story "Ranchero" by 
Stewart Edward White, have rarely been shown in public before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Koerner was born in Germany in 1878, and moved with his family to Clinton, 
Iowa, two years later. Encouraged to become an artist by a grammar 
schoolteacher who recognized his drawing ability, his first artistic job was to 
paint portraits of the family's cow on the sides of milk wagons. He received $5 
for each head. At age 20, he moved to Chicago where the art editor of the 
Chicago Tribune gave him a job illustrating news events that paid $5 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending art school in Chicago, where he met his wife, Lillian -- an 
artist who deferred her talents to his -- they moved to Michigan. There Koerner 
became art editor of a magazine, and he did illustrations for the Post and 
Kellogg companies' breakfast cereal advertisements. He also studied at the Art 
Students League in New York, and with Howard Pyle, known as "the Father of 
American Illustration." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver said the family "lived in New Jersey, halfway between New York City and 
Philadelphia, because that's where the publishers were. The big Curtis 
Publishing Co. was in Philadelphia, so it made it easy for daddy to deliver his 
illustrations. He only had maybe three or four weeks to make the illustrations, 
paint the pictures and deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magazine would send my father a story. He would read it and pick out a 
part (to illustrate) that he thought would make people read the story. You have 
to remember that this was long before radio and television, so people had to 
read in those days. The magazines were in their prime years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he composed a small sketch for each illustration. Several versions might 
follow to develop the composition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daddy would usually do what they would call a set of illustrations. It would 
be one large canvas, say 28 by 40 or 36 by 30 (inches). Then he'd do what they 
call a vignette, and then a spot." 
</P>
<P>
 A vignette, such as the 1934 "On the Alert," shows the essential elements of a 
scene on a background of stark white. Vignettes were fit onto magazine pages so 
that they gave maximum impact to related text. A spot depicts the head of a 
character or even a horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Koerner did 500 paintings for various Saturday Evening Post stories, but "he 
liked the Western stories best because we'd been out West so much and it was 
great. He liked the way the West looked, he liked the people, he liked the 
action of the horses and the cattle. Everybody was so genuine out there. He 
liked the outdoors, the rough and tumble." 
</P>
<P>
 So did his daughter, who said that first trip to Montana in 1924 with her 
father, mother and brother, Bill, seems "just as though it happened yesterday. 
We drove out there, camped out every night, cooked our own meals. We had a 
Brooks umbrella tent which we had to put up each night and take down every 
morning and roll it up and put it on the running board of this seven-passenger 
touring car." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1927, they took a Fred Harvey tour to see the Indians around Taos and Santa 
Fe. Until 1936, when her father could no longer hold a brush, the Koerner 
family spent time in the West every summer, including California and the 
coastal region of Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just remember so well how great everybody was, how kind they were to daddy, 
trying to give him information -- -- they'd be sure that he did things 
correctly," Oliver said. "But they didn't cater to him. In a snowstorm when 
they're driving the herd out of the canyon on the Crow reservation, he froze 
along with the best of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russell murals and many other works in the Hubbard Collection were 
originally owned by Edward and Estelle Doheny of Southern California. Edward 
founded Union Oil and Gas. Commissioned by the Dohenys in 1925, the murals 
carried two stipulations, according to Hubbard Collection literature: There 
were to be no Indians in the murals, and oil derricks must be included. Where

GOING TO THE SOURCE; THE ALEX THEATRE'S MUSICAL STAGING OF 'SAYONARA' IGNORES 
THE FAMOUS BRANDO FILM. INSTEAD IT STAYS TRUE TO THE THREE LOVE STORIES 
DEVELOPED IN JAMES MICHENER'S ORIGINAL NOVEL. 
</P>

<P>
 Is it a trend, turning successful films into stage musicals? Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunset Boulevard" at the Shubert Theatre is the film, with music added. The 
musical version of James Michener's "Sayonara," which opened last night at the 
newly refurbished Alex Theatre, ignores the popular Marlon Brando film and 
finds its source in Michener's original novel, without Hollywood's, and 
Brando's, adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also not a Johnny-come-lately. Director Philip William McKinley was 
introduced to "Sayonara" in script form in 1985, and the first staging took 
place at New Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse in 1987. It's been developing ever 
since, until this incarnation had its premiere last year at Houston's Theatre 
Under the Stars, then transferred to Seattle, then moved into its local venue. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley's idea is to make audiences forget the film, in which one of the 
three love stories that run through the novel was deleted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We became much more dedicated," McKinley says, "to the story that Michener 
wrote in the novel. The movie was a vehicle for Brando. That's the main 
difference. We've tried to be faithful to Michener and the characters in the 
novel. In some ways it was difficult, because you have really three love 
stories. You're tracking all three of them, and they all end very differently." 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley, who has directed many musicals at regional theaters coast to coast, 
recalls that Michener came to the Houston production and was pleased that it 
stayed true to his book. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when the director found out that "Sayonara" is the author's own 
story. Michener was the officer who dated the Takarazuka performer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's his story," McKinley says. "He's married to an Asian woman now. Years 
later the two of them went back to Japan and found the lady, and met with her. 
You wonder where the story came from. It's all true." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the romance between Major Ace Gruver and Hana-Ogi, a Japanese 
Takarazuka revue performer, reflected the social taboos of the day. Their love 
was doomed. Michener's feelings on the subject were first reflected in the 
story of Lt. Cable and Liat in "South Pacific," and Cable's heartbreaking 
anti-prejudice ballad "You've Got to Be Taught." 
</P>
<P>
 The emotions are just as strong in author William Luce's book for the musical. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley says: "It's an interesting show in that there aren't a lot of 
musicals that have suicides in them, and deal with the dramatic emotions that 
this story deals with. A lot of people said you have to have a happy ending, 
which the film did. To me there was a lot more there, about the different 
cultures, and how in that period of time in our history for two people from 
those opposite cultures there was just no way that relationship could have 
existed, especially coming from the restrictions of her life and his life." 
</P>
<P>
 The show is, of necessity, one that must have a strong book, harking back to 
the traditional form of the American musical, rather than the pseudo operas 
popular today. 
</P>
<P>
 The form also gives opportunities to choreographer Tony Stevens, whose 
Broadway credits include "Perfectly Frank" and "Rockabye Hamlet." More than 
half of the play's musical numbers are Japanese in style, with the remainder 
ranging from what Stevens calls "really show-bizzy dance numbers, to a 
jitterbug, to a fan dance." 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional span, from comedy to high drama and deep romance, is a 
choreographer's dream, Stevens says. "The show deals with every kind of 
theatrical device you can think of." 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley smiles at the word device. "We certainly don't do it like Noh 
theater. But you have a real sense of being in a Japanese setting, and a great 
deal of the action is underscored, and in that sense it's very cinematic." 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the show's leads have been with the production since Houston. Joseph 
Mahowald was in the Broadway production of "Les Miserables," and was appearing 
in "Assassins" at a regional theater in Ohio when he flew east for the audition 
for Ace Gruver. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he was calm at the audition, partly because he had only seen the film 
with Brando once. "This has a completely different feel," he says. "I really 
didn't pay much attention to the film. It didn't intimidate me at all. I knew 
that this was my role. I read the script and listened to some of the music, and 
I just thought, 'This is mine. It's mine. ' I had such a connection with it. 
It's a great piece, with a lot of depth. It's a heart-wrench." 
</P>
<P>
 As Hana-Ogi, Sala Iwamatsu may be familiar to Los Angeles theatergoers. She's 
the daughter of noted stage and screen actors Shizuko Hoshi and Mako, who was 
for many years artistic director of Hollywood's East West Players. Iwamatsu 
debuted at age 3 in that theater's production of "A Doll's House." Her friends 
and family haven't seen her perform on Broadway as Mimi in "Miss Saigon" or in 
"Sayonara." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father is the one she's nervous about. "I'll cry either way," Iwamatsu 
says, "whether he says I'm good or I'm bad. This is the first role where I 
finally am an adult. I'm mature and I'm strong. And I'm Japanese. It's 
exciting." Where and When

SEEKING ANSWERS TO EVIL; THE DRAMA DEPICTS HITLER, AT AGE 35, ON TRIAL FOR 
TREASON. THE PLAYWRIGHT CALLS HIM 'CHARISMATIC AND DIABOLICAL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Falotico would like you to meet a different Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitler is usually played as a paranoid old man in a bunker," notes the 
playwright, whose 12-character drama, "Adolf Hitler on Trial: The True Story," 
is opening tonight at the Center Stage Theatre. "Here he's young -- 35, he 
wears a suit. There's no mustache or swastika." Falotico's chronicle of Hitler 
as a politician on the rise includes the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch (his attempted 
coup d'etat), his subsequent trial for treason and the six-month prison term 
during which he wrote "Mein Kampf." 
</P>
<P>
 Falotico -- who by day is a San Fernando Valley attorney specializing in 
employment law -- traces his interest in Hitler's trial to law school, when he 
came across a complete court transcript made by the Germans in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,000-page document covers the 40-day trial that included 12 attorneys and 
50 witnesses; it was seized after the war and put in the U.S. National 
Archives. From this voluminous material (Hitler's opening statement alone ran 
four hours), the playwright has culled and edited Hitler's own words. Falotico 
created his own dialogue for the beer hall and prison scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to understand the appeal of Hitler, the playwright -- who presented 
an earlier version of this play at Venice's Rose Theatre in 1992 -- looks to 
Hitler's experiences during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult trying to understand a crazy man," he acknowledges. "But if 
you look at his time in the war: He was struck with shrapnel, blinded by 
mustard gas. At the end of the war, the soldiers didn't get weapons; they had 
to go into the trenches and take guns off the corpses. He was dehumanized, 
brutalized. He crawled out of the trenches and had no fear of death; he was 
inured to suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 Falotico believes Hitler was a truly anti-Semitic, anti-Communist master 
strategist. 
</P>
<P>
 "He chose his victims for their political expediency, those without power," he 
says. "At first, he wanted to put old people to death." Falotico allows, "He 
was a great orator, a human chameleon. (Albert) Speer said Hitler could adapt 
himself to the mood of any crowd. I wanted to present that eerie cunning, the 
ability he had to mesmerize. Talking to the court, he sounds like Clarence 
Darrow: logical, persuasive. In the prison cell with his cronies, the beast 
comes out, and you see the darker side." 
</P>
<P>
 Falotico, a native of Encino who taught high school calculus in Silver Lake 
before detouring to law school in the '80s, says his interest in Hitler has a 
lot to do with civic education. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you read how many people don't believe in the Holocaust, you have to 
spell it out," he says. "You have to show people. You have to show the details, 
how something like this could have happened. I first heard about the Holocaust 
when I was 6, so it's always been an appalling fact of life for me. I felt some 
duty to present this, prevent it from happening again. We had the Armenians, 
Cambodia, now Bosnia. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Francis Creighton, who also staged the play's 1992 run, likewise 
feels contemporary parallels in Hitler's story. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see things like Oliver North running for the Senate," he says 
grimly, "when a lawbreaker can run for office, it should be a warning that 
something like that could happen here." Although Creighton and Falotico are not

THEATER REVIEW; A MIXED BARD; WHITEFIRE'S HOURLONG PRODUCTION OF 'MACBETH' IS 
JUST A SURFACE TREATMENT, BUT MADCAP 'TWELFTH NIGHT' MAKES UP FOR IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T. H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coleridge said that watching Edmund Kean act was like reading Shakespeare by 
flashes of lightning. 
</P>
<P>
 The line is brought to mind at the beginning of Wendy Robie's one-hour version 
of "Macbeth" at the Whitefire Theatre. Three cloaked and hooded figures swirl 
about the stage in a dim twilight glow, illuminated intermittently by lightning 
bursts that awaken the audience's sense of expectation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, Coleridge's quote is still echoing. Robie's editing has retained 
most of the basic story in bright flashes, but left the psychology, the depth 
and poetry in the darkness of the cutting room floor. This "Macbeth" could be 
an able introduction to the play for the very young and inexperienced, but 
there is little left for a mature audience. And there's little time for the 
very capable actors to develop much in the way of characterization, even for 
Robie's sly Lady Macbeth or Tony Carreiro's gritty Thane. 
</P>
<P>
 Robie directs her eight actors with energy and a neat balance of values, but 
there just isn't enough time for more than a surface glance at the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both as editor and director, Robie has better luck with the second hourlong 
Shakespearean vignette, a rollicking, uproarious staging of "Twelfth Night." 
Even the Bard's most complicated comedy condenses well, and Robie has given it 
a clever and tasty modern setting, vaguely in the 1930s. The story is all there 
and, in this abridgment, enough of the high and very low comedy remains intact. 
You don't need to know the inner workings of the minds of these confused lovers 
and noble buffoons. Even at full length, Shakespeare knows better than to let 
psychology muck about with his laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Robie is a stalwart Viola (later disguised as Cesario) and sets the tone 
by appearing from her shipwreck in a tawdry Inverness slicker with a huge beach 
towel turban. Carreiro is as sensitively lovelorn an Orlando as his Macbeth was 
taut and aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting company, which was capable but not extraordinary in "Macbeth," 
is exquisitely madcap in "Twelfth Night" -- from Leland Crooke's prissy, 
officious Malvolio to Michael McNeill's geeky Sir Toby Belch. Daniel Hirsch is 
strong as both Viola's sea captain and her twin brother Sebastian's friend 
Antonio, and Andrea Goyan is a delightfully bimbotic Olivia. 
</P>
<P>
 John Furse, with the best command of the poetry as Macduff in "Macbeth," is a 
deliciously jiggly and coy overweight Maria in the comedy. The amazing Gene 
Weygandt actually assumes a new identity as each of his characters, including 
the drunken Porter and Macduff's innocent son in "Macbeth," and the raunchy Sir 
Andrew Aguecheek and stripling Sebastian in "Twelfth Night." 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid doubling of roles might confuse someone unfamiliar with the plays, 
and make a stew of the Scottish play, but wouldn't matter a whit with the 
comedy. Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "An Evening of Shakespeare."

JOIN THE CROWD; SUNDAY'S GAME -- BORING AS IT MAY BE -- AT LEAST GIVES FANS A 
CHANCE TO GET AWAY FROM EARTHQUAKE CLEANUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday's matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and the Buffalo Bills may not be 
the Super Bowl everyone was hoping for. Same teams as last year. Probably the 
same result. 
</P>
<P>
 But the game will provide a few hours of diversion for a San Fernando Valley 
that needs a diversion in the aftermath of the earthquake. It will also give 
people a chance to get out of the house, to get away from the picking up and 
sweeping up and join the crowd at a local sports bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Understand that finding a decent sports bar is no simple task. The Valley, 
unfortunately, has never been fertile ground for such establishments. Local 
lounges that boast multiple televisions tend to fall into the chain-restaurant, 
pick-up joint category. Places where small talk and double-entendres intrude on 
serious game-watching. An example: one West Valley restaurant advertises itself 
as a sports hangout ("4 satellite TVs, never miss any game"), but when asked 
about the Super Bowl, the manager wondered what time the game would start. 
Informed that the festivities will begin at 3 p.m. and probably stretch into 
early evening, he mused: 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have to turn it off early. We have karaoke on Sunday nights." 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating matters, the earthquake has left a couple of the Valley's 
better spots, including the venerable Telly's in Universal City, on the injured 
list for Super Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But there remain several places where fans can plop down in front of a 
big-screen television to see every play and replay. Places where people can can 
distract themselves with beer and bluster when the game turns one-sided which, 
if history proves reliable, should be midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Weber's Place, 19312 Vanowen St., Reseda  
</P>
<P>
 Size: Smallish bar with one big-screen and nine regular televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: This place has all the viewing technology of a sports bar wrapped 
up in the ambience of a neighborhood joint. "Every time there's a big game, 
we're here," said Patrick Bradbury of Northridge, a regular at the bar. "It's a 
good place to be with friends and watch the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: For those who like a little elbow room, the cramped quarters can 
be annoying. But, overall, Weber's has no glaring shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 Tendencies: The crowd is likely to be raucous, throwing a football around the 
bar, drinking pitchers of beer and screaming for the home team. 
</P>
<P>
 Game Plan: Grab a chair in front of the big screen and order a cheeseburger 
with French fries. Or try the Buffalo wings. And stay on your toes. At the 
height of the action, the bartender is likely to call a three-minute, half-off 
drink special, precipitating a mad rush to the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Funbar at Stuart Anderson's Black Angus, 235 S. First St., Burbank  
</P>
<P>
 Size: One big-screen, six monitors and four small monitors behind the bar. A 
full room of tables and booths. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: This place adequately covers the fundamentals football. Not 
blocking and tackling. We're talking about beer and beef. The Funbar has both 
Moosehead and Bass Ale on tap and the French dip sandwich will get you through 
four quarters and overtime, if necessary. The monitors behind the bar are 
perfect for those who prefer to belly up while they watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: No footballs autographed by Joe Montana, no sandwiches named after 
linebackers -- this bar suffers from enough dark wood and mood lighting to 
qualify as the quintessential suburban disco and meat market (which is exactly 
what it is on Friday nights). 
</P>
<P>
 Tendencies: On a recent playoff weekend, the place was as quiet as a morgue. 
Management predicts a big comeback for the Big Game, with a full barbecue and 
special contests in the parking lot before the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Game Plan: Forget the endlessly boring pregame show on television, Stuart 
Anderson's has the Budweiser and Miller Lite girls in a kissing booth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tickets, Warner Center Marriott, 21850 Oxnard St., Woodland Hills  
</P>
<P>
 Size: A wide room with a bar in the center, with two big-screen televisions 
and seven regular-sized screens. Plenty of seating. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: There's a screen in clear view from just about any seat in the 
house. The sound is loud enough, but not blaring. And two pool tables in the 
side room are in excellent condition and surrounded by televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: This bar started out as a dance club and still plays disco on 
Friday and Saturday nights. Spotlights and a glitter ball hang from the 
ceiling. The menu includes such items as chicken almondine and a vegetable 
platter. John Madden would not approve. 
</P>
<P>
 Tendencies: Tickets is the new kid in town, having only recently converted to 
a sports bar on weekends. So the place is not attracting big crowds. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Game Plan: If you're looking to avoid the rush and settle in for some serious 
watching with a $3 glass of Bass Ale, this is your place. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fish Broiler, 5530 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys.  
</P>
<P>
 Size: A small bar with a dozen or so booths and tables. One big screen and 
seven regular televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengths: Good lineage. This is a sister to the Encino Fish Broiler, which 
was a favorite meeting spot for Valley fans before it lost its lease last 
summer. Neither as large nor as popular, the Van Nuys location nonetheless 
offers plenty of screens and an oyster bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaknesses: The place can be a tad too cozy. On a busy day, you may find 
yourself with nowhere to stand, much less sit. And the sight lines aren't so 
great. 
</P>
<P>
 Tendencies: For Super Bowl Sunday, the Fish Broiler will pull out all the 
stops, offering chili dogs for 35 cents and chili fries for a quarter. Now this 
is football food. 
</P>
<P>
 Game Plan: A rarity among sports hangouts, the Fish Broiler takes reservations 
for seats in the bar. So call ahead and make plans to arrive as close to the 11 
a.m. opening time as possible. It'll give you time to load up on chili.

A WELCOME GUEST; EVERETTE HARP, WHO PLAYS ONCE A WEEK ON ARSENIO HALL'S SHOW, 
ENJOYS BE-BOP AND MAINSTREAM TUNES AS WELL AS JAZZ'S POP SIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Everette Harp is in the house with the Posse," Arsenio Hall says with his 
trademark wide-mouth grin and pointing to the contemporary jazz-pop 
saxophonist. 
</P>
<P>
 Pony-tailed Harp, 32, whom many know from his performances with pop singers 
Anita Baker, Sheena Easton and Kenny Loggins, is a regular Thursday night guest 
on Hall's late-night talk show, performing with Michael Wolff's band, The 
Posse. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatting a few minutes later with the sax man, who's wearing a black T-shirt 
and pants, Hall asks him about upcoming appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Harp mentions a concert, then a club performance tonight and Saturday night at 
the Room Upstairs at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll check you out, man," says Hall, beaming. "We'll come out and see you." 
</P>
<P>
 That night, neither the studio audience nor viewers at home have to wait to 
catch Harp. During the breaks, he's spotlighted, playing some high-energy alto 
sax at one point, some fat-toned tenor at another. He draws exuberant applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Harp, who since September has been a guest performer with the band, replacing 
saxophonist Dave Koz, says playing with Wolff and friends is a highlight of his 
week. "It feels great. It's a fun atmosphere and great exposure. The band is 
actually as loose as it seems on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 The Posse's approach to jazz, with the accent on catchy, pop-flavored, 
back-beat-driven numbers, mirrors the style that Harp follows when he leads a 
band, and that he selected for his debut Blue Note release, an album whose 
across-the-board appeal has resulted in sales of more than 100,000 albums. 
</P>
<P>
 "My music is strictly swinging jazz, not strictly commercial, but somewhere in 
between," Harp said. "Obviously, my album has some commerciality, but it has 
tunes that have sweet melodies that go somewhere, tunes that I can stretch out 
and that will keep me interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Harp, a Houston native who lives in Saugus with his wife, Jeri, and their 
daughter Tessa, 5, enjoys not only the pop side of jazz but highly melodic, and 
often highly complex, be-bop and modern mainstream tunes. And although he might 
play such a selection in person, as when he plays at Le Cafe, he won't yet put 
one on his albums. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to play tunes that you can go anywhere on, but I know they're not 
going to sell any records," he said. "As much as I like the purity of jazz and 
like to do what I want to do, I know this is a business." 
</P>
<P>
 Harp grew up singing as well as playing woodwinds, and sings in person and on 
his new album. And he says he also vocalizes internally as he plays. "My tunes 
lend themselves to vocal phrasing," he said. "I'll sing a solo inside, and that 
really helps me. It's like lyrics are coming out of the horn. And I see my 
album as a vocal album, only the songs are sung on the saxophone." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of his first recording has allowed Harp to experiment a bit on his 
new album, he says. "While there are a lot of tunes that are really commercial, 
there are some that aren't," he said. "Like a swing version of the Stylistics' 
hit, 'You Made Me Feel Brand-New.' And Branford Marsalis did a track and played 
his tail off." 
</P>
<P>
 Harp cites a wealth of influences, from such be-boppers as Sonny Stitt to more 
commercially minded fellows such as Grover Washington Jr. and David Sanborn. 
The latter has been a particularly strong model. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, I was stuck sounding like David, but at some point, you have 
to break away and find your own identity," Harp said. "I'm trying to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The saxophonist has developed a loyal following. Hall is definitely a Harp 
fan. "Everette possesses a funky and powerful sax sound that is very compatible 
with The Posse," Hall said. "I find myself mesmerized by his gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Jaffe, owner of Le Cafe, is another aficionado. "I like his energy, his 
musicality," Jaffe said. "He always gets excited about his music." 
</P>
<P>
 Harp muses about his career, and says he knows that he's been blessed. "There 
are a lot of guys out there who are great players who haven't gotten the 
recognition I have," he said. "Sometimes I feel like I haven't worked hard 
enough for what I've gotten." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Everette Harp.

FINALLY TAKING HIS VOICE SERIOUSLY; DICK MONTANA WENT INTO A 'WORK FRENZY' 
AFTER HE WAS DIAGNOSED AS HAVING THYROID CANCER. 
</P>

<P>
 When country singer Dick Montana was told in 1990 that he needed surgery for 
thyroid cancer, he was facing not only his own mortality, but the potential 
loss of his gravelly baritone and the end of his creative life. 
</P>
<P>
 The bearded singer-drummer for the heartland rock act the Beat Farmers dived 
into a "work frenzy," he said, entering a studio to preserve his voice on tape 
before it was lost forever to cancer and the surgeon's knife. His voice 
survived that surgery, and others since. But Montana was finally heeding the 
advice of fellow rockers Dave Alvin and John Doe, taking his own voice 
seriously for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It forced me to work," said Montana, who hopes soon to release a solo album 
tentatively titled "The Great Lost Country Dick Montana." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I'm in this mode now, getting things done. Cancer has been very, 
very good to me. And chicks dig scars." 
</P>
<P>
 This somehow explains his outfit, called Country Dick's Garage, a San 
Diego-based solo project band that will perform Saturday night at the Palomino 
in North Hollywood. It's the first local show for the band, which Montana began 
playing and recording with after that first operation. 
</P>
<P>
 When not touring with the Beat Farmers, Montana has led Country Dick's Garage 
through regular Wednesday night gigs at a small club in San Diego. The Palomino 
show is the band's first in Los Angeles, and will mark the debut of some of 
Montana's more personal music. He even has "a tender ballad," he said. Calling 
the solo material "stunningly close to music," he added: "It's going to 
surprise some people. It's serious, but not pretentiously serious stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say that Montana has given up singing selections from his cache 
of smarmy drinking tunes. Among his favorites is the obscure Dean Martin song 
called "Party Dolls and Wine," which includes the lyric: "They say some day 
I'll meet my match/ Until that time, down the hatch." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best Dean Martin song that ever was," Montana said. "It fell through 
the cracks in '72. They must have thought it was too much for the elevator 
music crowd. They're right." 
</P>
<P>
 Country Dick's Garage includes Joey Harris of the Beat Farmers on guitar, 
guitarist Robert Vaughan (who is also co-producing the Montana record), bassist 
Rick Nash, drummer Greg LaRocca, fiddler Chris Vidas and Steelbone Dick on 
steel guitar and trombone. Montana sings and plays accordion. Also singing is 
Candy Kane, a rock and rhythm-and-blues vocalist, "a former porn star, and 
still pretty nasty," Montana said. "She's got a great voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana is set for another operation Feb. 2, although doctors have said this 
isn't a threat to his vocal chords. Assuming all goes well, he'll be continuing 
his new high-velocity work schedule: alone, with the Beat Farmers and with such 
other side projects as the Pleasure Barons (whose members include Alvin, Doe, 
Rosie Flores and Mojo Nixon). 
</P>
<P>
 The Beat Farmers are searching for a new record label and plan to release an 
album that the band finished recording over the summer in Vancouver. It will be 
the Farmers' first since 1990. For them, it will be a long-awaited return to 
recording music that Times critic Mike Boehm last year described as coming at 
you "with highly skilled and heartfelt heartland rock one minute, and Montana's 
stumblebum barfly meanderings and toilet humor the next." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Palomino show is just the latest evidence of Montana's new creative 
energy. "It's just nice to get out of the house," he said. "Hopefully, some of 
our buddies will be good enough to show up." Where and When

THE SHOW MUST GO ON; CUSTOMERS ARE STAYING AWAY IN DROVES AFTER THE QUAKE BUT 
ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN SOON.

 The post-quake period has been rough on parents. The little ones believe it is 
their God-given right to sleep with Mom and Dad in perpetuity. And the older 
kids, many of them suffering from involuntary mall withdrawal, are barely able 
to meet their visual information needs with round-the-clock MTV. We have 
learned we can do without hot water. We can do without home-delivered pizza. 
But it's clear that we need every movie theater we can get. Film does more than 
Prozac can: give us some sorely needed peace by getting our 
entertainment-starved loved ones out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, the Valley is almost back to normal, movie-wise. Last Friday the 
Peppertree in Northridge and its sister discount movie house, the Plaza in 
Newhall, reopened for business. According to Doug Endicott, who books films for 
those and other area theaters, the Peppertree suffered an estimated $25,000 
worth of cosmetic damage in the recent Northridge quake. There was just enough 
unmarred space on the battered marquee to announce "Now Open," Endicott said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the good news. The bad news is that customers are staying away in 
droves. "No one's coming," said Endicott. "People are too nervous." 
Predictably, moviegoers are more jittery the closer they are to the epicenter. 
Thus, the Peppertree, nerve-rackingly close to the seismic bull's-eye, took in 
$1,035 the weekend after the quake, only 13% of what it grossed the weekend 
before. The Newhall theater, not quite so epicenter convenient, grossed 37% of 
its pre-disaster take. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday of this week, all seven screens were in operation at the Fallbrook 
General Cinema in West Hills. But things weren't quite back to normal at the 
concession stand. The quake did nothing to impede the traffic in such hardy 
movie-theater comestibles as Milk Duds and Red Vines. But, with the safety of 
the local water supply in question, the management had to find an alternative 
to its normal practice of mixing fountain drinks from Los Angeles water and 
soft-drink syrup. Instead, commercially bottled soft drinks and bottled water 
were being sold at the concession stand. Only commercially made ice was being 
used, purchased from sources approved by public health officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other General Cinema complexes in the Valley were still wholly or 
partially closed at press time. The GCC Sherman Oaks Cinema at 4500 Van Nuys 
Blvd. is located in two separate buildings, one north of Milbank Street, the 
other south. Damage to the southern site, which houses three screens, was still 
being assessed earlier this week, according to Ellen Aub, vice president for 
film marketing for General Cinema. The damage is repairable, she says, but she 
could not give an estimated reopening date. The two screens on the north side 
of the street (in the same plaza as the Hughes Market) were expected to be back 
in business today or Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's anybody's guess when the GCC Northridge General Cinema will reopen in the 
devastated Northridge Fashion Center. Damage assessment has barely begun. 
"We're not permitted access yet," Aub explained. 
</P>
<P>
 United Artists expects to reopen its Granada Hills theater today. Three out of 
six screens at United Artists Warner Center should also be operational today, 
says Neal Pinsker, UA general manager for California, Nevada and Arizona. Three 
additional auditoriums are awaiting evaluation by a structural engineer and 
could open as soon as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons of United Artists Valley Plaza will have to wait considerably longer. 
The North Hollywood complex suffered damage in the quake to an outside wall and 
to the decorative steel out front, Pinsker said. Inside, there was cosmetic 
damage, as well as shattered light fixtures and TV monitors. Pinsker was unable 
to estimate the dollar amount of the damage but says the theater will probably 
remain closed for at least two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinsker is confident that once people get over their post-quake fear of being 
inside buildings -- any buildings -- they'll be going back to the movies in 
record numbers. Pinsker oversaw UA's recovery operations in Florida and 
Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. Movies briefly went bust after the 
storm, he said, but ultimately boomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann Valley West in Tarzana suffered a still undetermined amount of cosmetic 
damage in the quake, according to Clyde Cornell, executive director of 
operations for Mann. "We hope -- I guess everybody's doing a lot of hoping 
these days -- to get under way again in two or three weeks," he said. "Luckily, 
our screens came through it. We did have to realign our projectors." The Mann 
Sycamore 6 in Simi Valley was more seriously damaged and will remain closed for 
at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell, too, thinks the quake will ultimately help, not hurt, moviegoing. 
"Initially, everybody hunkers down, but that only lasts a couple of days, if 
that," said Cornell, who supervised the reopening of Mann's Northern California 
theaters after the Loma Prieta quake. After all, he pointed out, escape is what 
movies are all about. 
</P>
<P>
 At press time, the Pacific Galleria in the Sherman Oaks Galleria remained 
closed. Pacific representatives had not been able to get into the theater to 
assess the damage because Galleria officials were concerned about possible 
structural damage to the parking structure, according to Milt Moritz, Pacific's 
vice president for advertising and public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Pacific Northridge Cinemas, four out of six screens are now in use. 
Damage to the two other auditoriums is still being studied, and no reopening 
date has been set, Moritz says. Business has been slow but not dreadful: 
Attendance last weekend was about 25% of pre-quake levels. Like other local 
businesses, Pacific Northridge has been holding an earthquake sale of sorts. 
All tickets are half price.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: DIGGING FOR TREASURE; CLEVELAND WRECKING OFFERS MANY 
ITEMS SALVAGED FROM ITS VARIOUS DEMOLITION PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 There are many avenues for the intrepid bargain-shopper. The more common are 
off- price retailers, discounters and factory outlets. But there's an area to 
investigate that is not for the timid -- the demolition, or wrecking, company. 
</P>
<P>
 For 83 years, Cleveland Wrecking Co. has been demolishing structures around 
the world. Since the Northridge earthquake, the company has been hired to 
demolish several structures, including the Barrington Building, parts of 
Northridge Fashion Center, Topanga Plaza and the Trillium complex in Woodland 
Hills. Whether it has been hired to strip a building or totally demolish it, 
whatever remains in the structure becomes the property of the wrecking company. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, decorators or architects purchase pieces on-site. When St. Paul's 
Episcopal Church in downtown Los Angeles was razed several years ago, the 
public was invited to purchase statues, stained glass windows, pews and 
lecterns. 
</P>
<P>
 More often, the salvage is moved to Cleveland Wrecking's yard, where builders, 
contractors and do-it-yourselfers dig for treasure. On network television 
several years ago, I showed some gargoyles that had adorned the old Atlantic 
Richfield building that Cleveland Wrecking demolished. A South Carolina man 
called right after and bought all 10 for $200 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows who might want a 12-foot plaster statue of Abraham Lincoln from the 
old Los Angeles High School? It's yours for $1,500. Or a concrete plaque 
bearing the school's name, available for $500? 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Sheraton Town House was stripped by Cleveland's crew, and many 
of the fixtures are for sale. Brass table lamps are $10, as are some outdoor 
coach lights. A well-made sofa crying for a new cover was $50. Dishes and 
glassware from the dining rooms were in boxes and marked 25 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, Disneyland hired Cleveland to do some work. As a result, curved 
pieces of wrought-iron fencing from the Anaheim park are available for $100 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the Beverly Hills Hotel was renovated recently, Cleveland did some 
demolition work there, and now you can find the white shuttered room doors 
selling for $50 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect to find any earthquake mementos. "There will be little or no 
salvage from these available in the store," said Irwin Bloom, the store 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrecking yard may be colorful and fun, but more mundane bargains can be 
found inside, where kitchen and bathroom cabinetry and fixtures are marked to 
sell for some of the lowest prices in town. A complete 84-foot kitchen 
assembly, including finished sink unit with Formica top, double sink, 
single-spigot faucet and unfinished cabinets is $285. Comparable units sell for 
about $400. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanities are available in a wide price range. A 19-by-17-inch marble-top unit, 
with sink but no faucets, is $39.95 (regular retail $59.95). A particularly 
good buy the day I visited was a polished brass bar faucet for $69.95 instead 
of $109.95. Where to Shop

FINDING KEYBOARD KIN; MEMBERS OF SENIORNET TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING, WITH ABOUT 50 
CATEGORIES ON WHICH THEY CAN WRITE. THEY EVEN HAVE AN ON-LINE COCKTAIL PARTY, 
AND SOME ARE PLANNING A CRUISE.

 Within minutes of the Northridge quake, Polly Black was receiving messages 
from all over the country, direct to her on-line mailbox on SeniorNet. 
</P>
<P>
 When Black was able to sign on after she got power back at midnight the day of 
the quake, she found 174 messages, from as far away as the East Coast and 
Alaska -- all offering love and help. One message from a woman in New York 
begged Black to check on her aunt in a Sylmar trailer park; Black asked her 
daughter who lives in the area to scout for the woman, and messaged back the 
good news that the woman was fine. 
</P>
<P>
 In good times, SeniorNet is keyboard cocktail parties, chat and a chance to 
discuss everything from kid troubles to politics. In the wake of the quake, it 
was a communication link with the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 SeniorNet, a nonprofit, San Francisco-based organization, calls itself the 
community of computer-using seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 10,000 members nationwide, it has 57 learning centers that 
offer students 55 and older workshops in computer technologies. But it's 
through the organization's SeniorNet Online that senior citizens are finding 
keyboard kin. 
</P>
<P>
 For Black, joining SeniorNet three years ago created a network of friends and 
interests she thought were seriously missing in her life. She believed that she 
was wasting away at home, doing nothing. A 64-year-old widow living with her 
son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren in Woodland Hills, she was 
disconnected from others and bored.  
</P>
<P>
 After hearing about SeniorNet, her son came home and persuaded his mother to 
find out more about it. He brought a computer into her room and signed her up 
with America Online, a national information service that allows users to 
communicate using a phone, modem and computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, Black has been on-line five to six hours a day. "It's the best 
thing that ever happened to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Wednesday night, from 6:30 to 7:30, these senior keyboard communicators 
have an on-line cocktail party. Black said Phil, in San Francisco, tends bar -- 
which means he offers members a drink as they sign on -- and he draws the glass 
on the screen using parentheses and underlines. Others draw bowls of chips and 
dip (the chips are made with capital C's). Some sip wine as they type in their 
chatter; others are teetotalers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Schlein of Reseda, a widow who lives alone, enjoys the chance to stay 
up until 2 or 3 in the morning, talking on-line. "I like it; it's friendly," 
she said. She's joining 40 other SeniorNet Onliners for a three-day cruise to 
Mexico in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the talk is light. Black told a story about a Colorado member who kept 
typing into the system that he was short of breath, but he wasn't getting off 
the modem line to call 911. A member in Washington state called police in the 
Colorado member's hometown, and is credited by other on-line users with saving 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Black said members talk about everything, with about 50 different categories 
on which they can write, including politics, a gay and lesbian forum, a 
generation-to-generation arena, questions and answers on computers and videos. 
</P>
<P>
 As the computer communicators have gotten to know each other, they have 
started to organize face-to-face meetings when they're in a keyboard friend's 
town. Black said it is sometimes hard to meet an on-line confidant in person -- 
some are bold and witty on-line, but shy and retiring in the flesh. "But when 
you meet, it's like you've met a part of your family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Griffith, a 67-year-old divorced psychologist in Sherman Oaks, has 
been using SeniorNet Online for about three months. She, too, is going on the 
cruise to Mexico, although she has not yet met anyone else who has signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "But everybody is so absolutely warm -- if you can conceive of warmth on a 
computer screen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Furlong, SeniorNet president, said she is amazed at the sense of 
community that has developed through the on-line service. She finds that a lot 
comes across through the way people present themselves via the keyboard. "You 
know whether someone is warm, intuitive, cheerful -- you see their ideas -- and 
not whether someone is fat or blue-haired," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Furlong first developed the idea of SeniorNet Online, her vision was to 
re-create a neighborhood park that she had enjoyed in her childhood, a place 
where people would come during the day to talk. But now, she said, she sees the 
system working less like a town square and more like an interactive diary.  
</P>
<P>
 The data shows most seniors read more, listen to more radio and watch more 
television than do most other demographic groups. "But not a lot of media will 
let you talk back," the San Francisco resident said. Typically, new users begin 
by lurking -- reading others' comments -- then gradually evolve to chatting 
through forums and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Members' demographics are interesting: 51% are between 66 and 75, 36% have 
some post-college or graduate degree, and 68% are not working or are retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith, a specialist in neurolinguistics, said signing on has changed her 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no body language, just the keyboard, timing and quips. The syntax is 
very revealing. But just to visualize the people I'm talking to is a trip. It's 
like reading a novel, except here you can ask questions of the characters." 
Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: SeniorNet is a special-interest group for computer users on the America 
Online service. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: SeniorNet members can use SeniorNet Online by subscribing to America 
Online for $9.95 a month. SeniorNet membership is $25 a year, which includes a 
quarterly newsletter and discounts from software publishers and other computer 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Call: To order, write SeniorNet, 399 Arguello Blvd., San Francisco 94118, or

TURTLE LOVERS UNITE; CLUB MEMBERS SHARE A KEEN INTEREST IN THE ANIMALS AND WORK 
FOR THEIR WELFARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Think about packing your pet in a comfy shoe box lined with want ads and 
storing it on a shelf in the garage for the winter. Sure beats paying a pet 
sitter or boarding fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 60 San Fernando Valley members of the California Turtle and Tortoise 
Club, about 35 share this advantage, since their California desert tortoises 
are deep into their winter hibernation. 
</P>
<P>
 The group meets once a month at Fallbrook Square to share their interest in 
turtles and tortoises and to work for their welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our chapter . . . rescues a lot of tortoises that people don't want or can't 
take care of anymore. We get about three calls a week," says club President Bob 
Kinder. 
</P>
<P>
 He explains that in the 1950s, it was a fad to drive out to the desert and 
bring a tortoise back. Now these owners are moving out of state or into 
retirement homes and can't take these pets with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, California desert tortoises are on the endangered species list, and it 
is illegal to remove them from the desert or take them across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once desert tortoises are taken from the desert and moved to damp areas, they 
develop an upper-respiratory disease that never goes away. They can't be 
returned to the desert because they carry the disease back to the healthy 
tortoises," says Kinder's wife, Bettyalice. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service sometimes contacts the organization to help 
save confiscated animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pet dealers in foreign countries frequently ship turtles or tortoises here 
illegally. Rather than stressing these animals by putting them back on a plane 
for another 22 hours and risk losing them completely, they ask us to take care 
of them," says club adoption Chairwoman Diane Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not unusual for college instructors Levine and her husband Stan to have 
buckets of undersized helmeted side-neck turtles from Ghana on their dining 
room table. The couple's back yard is divided into turtle habitats. One pond 
has large red-eared sliders that weigh about 15 pounds. These are the same 
green turtles Stan Levine remembers buying from the neighborhood drugstore and 
holding in the palm of his hand when he was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how big the sliders get when they're raised in a big pond 
instead of a small aquarium," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Levines' side yard is devoted to Lois and Clark, two African spurred 
thighed tortoises the couple adopted a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're from the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, and they need a dry and 
warm climate all the time," Stan Levine says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Levines gave Lois and Clark individual dog igloos, complete with separate 
heating blankets, because the tortoises prefer to be alone.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lois is an early riser, and Clark likes to sleep in," says Stan. "She's 
pretty territorial. One day the cable repairman took off because he saw 
45-pound Lois barreling down the yard after him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe it or not, Lois can move pretty fast when she wants to," Diane says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also sharing adoption duties, club member Kay Berry makes follow-up visits 
after a turtle goes to a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bring my own scale to make sure the turtle is growing," says Berry, a 
cosmetologist who devotes about 25 hours a week to turtle duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also want to make the public aware of the special needs these animals 
have," says Bettyalice Kinder, who each week buys fresh fruit and two large 
boxes of frozen carrots and peas to feed her turtles. 
</P>
<P>
 The club does not buy or sell turtles, but keeps a waiting list for adoptions. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very protective. New owners are carefully screened to make sure they 
will give the turtles the care they need," says Virginia Ditto of the adoption 
committee. "When the 'Ninja Turtle' movie came out, mothers bombarded pet 
stores looking for a birthday present for their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Club members would like to see retail stores prohibited from selling turtles 
and tortoises, especially since so many of them are neglected by their young 
owners. Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: California Turtle and Tortoise Club. 
</P>
<P>
 When: 7:30 p.m. the third Friday of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Community Meeting Room, Fallbrook Square Mall, 6507 Fallbrook Ave., 
Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Club's educational exhibit at Van Nuys Sherman Oaks Recreation Center, 
14201 Huston Ave., Sherman Oaks. Hundreds of tortoises and turtles will be 
displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 When: In May, at a date to be announced.

RELUCTANT NOVICE: GREENHORN LEARNS THE ROPES; A NOVICE FINDS COWBOY COLLEGE 
ROUGH AND TUMBLE, BUT THE PIERCE COURSE HONES THE SKILLS OF TOP YOUNG RODEO 
COMPETITORS.

 Cowboy carnage. That's what happens at rodeos -- rope 'em, tie 'em, castrate 
'em events where bulls end up emasculated and cowboys wind up bruised beyond 
recognition. I was about to learn the finer points of lassoing an enraged bull, 
tying him up and applying a scalpel to his most prized possession. 
</P>
<P>
 I wait with 23 students from Pierce College's rodeo class for a herd of 
Mexican Coriente steers and bulls to stampede down hills that surround the 
college's farm. Instructor Ron Wechsler is rounding them up from a nearby 
pasture. 
</P>
<P>
 Wechsler, an associate professor of animal science, appears in the distance 
looking like the Marlboro man amid a stand of scrub oak. Steers scatter down 
the hill before him as he shouts, "Heee yaaaa!" Traffic on the freeway roars in 
the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals are herded into an outdoor holding pen while Wechsler explains the 
finer points of steer wrestling and team roping. Like a football coach, he 
scratches out a diagram in the dirt, showing how riders should approach an 
animal. The students, half of them women and most with some experience, shift 
their belt buckles -- the size of dinner plates -- spit on the ground and look 
interested. I try to keep my new Tony Lama boots from getting dusty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two-credit class is not required, but students like Jennifer Clark, 19, of 
Thousand Oaks and Scott Perez, 19, of Saugus are taking it to brush up on their 
skills. Some will compete in the Intercollegiate Rodeo Assn., which has 3,000 
members from 300 colleges. Clark and Perez both started roping around age 7 and 
were named all-around cowgirl and cowboy by the California High School Rodeo 
Assn. three years in a row beginning in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark decides to show me some roping techniques while the animals are packed 
into a narrow holding pen that leads to a chute. 
</P>
<P>
 She twirls the rope, her arm crooked at a 90-degree angle as the lasso whips 
the air. "It's all in the wrist action," Clark says, letting the rope fly. It 
descends in a perfect arc around me and cinches my waist. I didn't recall this 
ever happening to Lorne Greene on "Bonanza." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark moves on to heeling -- or lassoing a bull's hind legs -- used when tying 
up an animal for branding and castration. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with throwing a lasso at a running bull is that you have to hook 
the rope under the animal's legs before it hits the ground. Clark explains that 
you must twirl the rope in time with the animal's gait so the lasso slides 
under its hind feet. Of course, you also have to maneuver your horse, shout 
"yip yip yip yip yip yip" and chew tobacco without dribbling it down your chin. 
Clark claims it's the most fun you can have with your boots on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clark demonstrates heeling as I jump up and down in place, imitating a 
550-pound bull running for his life. Her lasso lands in a neat hoop behind my 
boots and slides under them while I'm airborne.  
</P>
<P>
 After a few tries, I'm able to land the rope behind Clark's heels, but I can't 
get it under her feet. Perez, meanwhile, is off to the side doing impressive 
rope tricks -- the ocean wave, the butterfly and the Texas skip. It looks like 
he's in the midst of a writhing dance of snakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez comes over to review our progress. We talk about bull riding and the 
kind of horses he and Clark own. "Hers is older than this college," he jokes. 
"She dyes the mane on it -- to get rid of the gray hairs." Clark ratchets up 
her rope and lets it fly, landing like an angry tornado around Perez's head. 
</P>
<P>
 She cinches it tight and says, "What did you say, cowboy?" I feel like I'm on 
the set of "Thelma & Louise, Part II." 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to get the cattle lined up. Before they can be roped during events, 
horns must be wrapped. The fatter cattle, having grazed all summer, can get 
stuck in the chute and the wrapping makes their horns easier to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 An electric cattle prod works well to keep the animals moving through. I am 
the first to raise my hand when volunteers to use the device are called for, 
but Shardi Fontes, 18, of Oxnard beats me to it. I can tell she has used it 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "A friend of mine brings one to bed with her," Fontes says as she zaps a 
stubborn steer. "She uses it to keep her husband on his side of the bed. It 
works pretty well." Fontes tells me her friend has prodded her mate just once 
during their 13-year marriage. I tell her she should hawk the gadgets at future 
Tailhook conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The animals are ready to be released, and Wechsler and Clark mount horses to 
show us how it's done. A steer charges out of the pen, a bit dazed as it enters 
the large arena, where Wechsler keeps it running in a straight line while Clark 
whips up a momentum with her lasso.  
</P>
<P>
 It's my turn, but darn, the three-hour class is up and it's time to meander 
back down the freeway to the homestead. Before I leave, I jot down the brand 
name of the electric cattle prod -- just in case anyone tries to steal my car 
while I'm stopped at a hitching post down in Rancho de Los Angeles.

 NO RESPECT: Pity the quake-plagued residents of the Crescent Valley Mobile 
Home Park in Santa Clarita: No running water. No natural gas. No mail delivery. 
And they had no cable until Thursday! . . . They can only enter and leave by 
showing passes and going with CHP escorts. That's because they're trapped by 
reconstruction of a new bypass to the Golden State Freeway. "A little attention 
would be nice," said one resident. (B10) 
</P>
<P>
 SAVE THE PETS: Within half an hour of the 6.6 quake, the owner and manager of 
Petland at the Northridge Fashion Center arrived to save the dogs, cats, birds, 
reptiles and rodents. Aquariums shattered and exotic fish flopped across the 
floor, but the majority of animals and birds were rescued. "The puppies didn't 
seem to mind the earthquake too much," the store's manager said. (B5) 
</P>
<P>
 MOVING: The wheels of justice move slowly, and sometimes they come off 
entirely. The San Fernando Superior Court building suffered a lot of quake 
damage and probably will be uninhabitable for most of 1994. Thursday, court 
employees (above) removed files to be transferred to other courthouses. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 SUPER BREAK: OK, so we're saddled with America's Losers, the Bills, against 
America's Team, the Cowboys, for Sunday's Super Bowl, instead of a dream duel 
between Joe Montana and his ex-teammates, the San Francisco 49ers. . . . Still, 
a visit to your local sports bar for an afternoon of football and festivities 
promises a super diversion from aftershocks and quake cleanup chores. See 
Valley Life! 
</P>
<P>
 SHOWTIME: Or, if football isn't your ideal escape, there are plenty of movies, 
music and plays to spice up the weekend entertainment calendar. Cal State 
Northridge, CalArts, and other venues remain closed for quake repairs, but 
Valley clubs and coffeehouses hope to fill the gap. . . . Most movie theaters 
have reopened, although many people are too rattled to attend. See Valley Life!

 COMMUTER TOWN: Hank Carrillo has a theory about why Fillmore (pop. 12,001) has 
the highest percentage of car-poolers in Ventura County: "People are more 
willing to ride with people they know, and everybody tends to know each other 
here," said Carrillo, director of the Fillmore Chamber of Commerce. . . . Being 
20 to 35 miles from job centers in Ventura, Santa Clarita and the San Fernando 
Valley also discourages solo commutes. . . . Two-thirds of Fillmore's labor 
force works outside the city.

 LATEST LINE: Crime went down last year in several county cities, judging by 
recent stats. But it's on the rise again this week -- in the form of Super Bowl 
office pools. . . . "They're all illegal lotteries," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Gregory W. Brose. And playing any role in such a scheme -- preparing a betting 
sheet, drawing numbers, asking a co-worker to join in -- is a misdemeanor worth 
up to six months in jail. . . . But Brose can't recall any Ventura County 
prosecutions. . . . Amount bet in Nevada on the last Super Bowl: $56 million. 
</P>
<P>
 GRIM CRUSADER: Speaking of Super Bowl Sunday, it's one of Yvon Chouinard's 
favorite days. "I can surf Rincon without the crowd," said Chouinard, founder 
of Ventura's Patagonia Inc. . . . Enjoying the outdoors has been his life's 
work, but he's given up on saving the planet -- he'd just like to delay its 
demise (E1). . . . "It's completely hopeless. Civilization is out of control."

 ORAL REPORT: Leodes Van Buren of Newbury Park High, all-time leading pass 
receiver in California high school football, made an oral commitment to attend 
the University of Colorado moments after getting word that he had achieved a 
qualifying score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. The first day high school 
seniors may sign a letter of intent with Division I schools is Feb. 2. . . . 
Van Buren caught 269 passes for 4,446 yards in his career at Newbury Park and 
helped the Panthers to a 14-0 record and the Southern Section Division III 
championship this past season. (C8)

 MAMA MIA: It doesn't do justice to Bob Howard's penchant for pasta to say he's 
a regular at Prego Ristorante. The Newport Beach business executive dines at 
the Irvine eatery up to six times a week and even hosted his daughter's wedding 
reception there, spending nearly $25,000 over the last year. Now it's paid off: 
Prego is sending him and his wife to Italy in May as winners of its frequent 
diner contest. . . . First, though, Howard has pledged to lose the 20 pounds 
he's gained since he started eating there. 
</P>
<P>
 R.I.P.: The spectacular collapse of Lincoln Savings & Loan nearly five years 
ago has spawned many epitaphs. But only now, perhaps, can the Irvine thrift be 
buried properly: One of Charles Keating's former branches in Lakewood has been 
turned into a mortuary. . . . "It's an ironic twist that out of a dead savings 
and loan came a funeral home," says mortuary President Randall Stricklin, who 
makes his office out of what used to be a vault. 
</P>
<P>
 A PLEDGE: Paula Burton, the "flag lady" from Villa Park who likes to drape 
herself -- quite literally -- in the red, white and blue, is unfurling a new 
bid to rally people 'round Old Glory. Her choir of local children, wearing 
flag-adorned shirts, sang the Pledge of Allegiance before the Villa Park City 
Council meeting this week, and they hope to hit every local city before they're 
done. The aim, Burton says, is simply "to spread patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
 SAME OLD SONG: Residents in the Marina Hill area of Seal Beach thought they 
had fixed the problem, but they're complaining once again about noisy passenger 
jets buzzing over their neighborhood as a northbound shortcut to Long Beach 
Airport. Mayor Gwen Forsythe offered residents some advice at this week's 
council meeting: Call the airport at (310) 429-6647 as soon as you see or hear 
an airliner in the area. "Hopefully," she says, "if they get enough phone 
calls, they will do something about it."

OFFICIALS MISS DEADLINE FOR SMOG COMPROMISE; POLLUTION: BUT STATE AND FEDERAL 
NEGOTIATORS SAY THEY ARE MAKING PROGRESS ON CHANGING CALIFORNIA CAR 
INSPECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Newly resumed negotiations over vehicle smog checking methods between state 
and federal officials pushed past the Thursday deadline imposed by Gov. Pete 
Wilson for reaching a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators reported progress on ending the impasse and said talks will resume 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had good meetings, very productive," said state Sen. Newton R. Russell 
(R-Glendale), a member of the California negotiating team and lead author of a 
bill to overhaul California's automobile smog test and repair program. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the federal Environmental Protection Agency contend the bill, by 
failing to require that smog tests and emission system repairs take place at 
separate locations, is not strong enough to bring the smoggiest regions of 
California into compliance with U.S. clean-air requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to Wilson said they expected him to sign the bill Thursday and await 
further legislation that might result from the renewed talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would not take effect as law until next year, giving both the Clinton 
Administration and California additional time to arrive at a compromise. If a 
settlement occurs, the accord could be swiftly enacted and supersede the 
Russell measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who had endorsed the bill as a "common sense" way to cleanse the air 
without jeopardizing the economy, was expected by his aides to sign it without 
the public ceremony that usually accompanies high-profile issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would preserve the current system of authorizing 9,000 local garages 
and service stations to both test vehicle exhaust emissions and make repairs, a 
double role that critics contend encourages fraud. It also would authorize 
random roadside testing, impose stiffer penalties for fraud, require smog 
technicians to be better trained and ban the worst polluters from the roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, federal EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner urged Wilson 
to veto the bill. She said the legislation would go only halfway toward meeting 
federal exhaust emission reduction standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the bill, which passed the Legislature with bipartisan support 
last week, said it demonstrated California's resolve to aggressively intensify 
the fight against smog. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the basic framework of what we believe is best for California," Russell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal EPA officials have warned that unless the Smog Check program is 
reformed, additional controls on industrial sources of air pollution will occur 
automatically in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Washington had threatened sanctions sooner. But one week after the 
Northridge earthquake, Browner canceled discretionary sanctions that would have 
cost California about $800 million in highway funds this spring. She took the 
action as President Clinton was promising massive federal aid to help Southern 
California recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Wilson agreed to resumption of the talks, the first round of which 
occurred Wednesday in Sacramento. The governor imposed a deadline of Thursday 
for reaching a solution, but it went unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell said that Wilson, by establishing a deadline, wanted to test the 
sincerity of the EPA in seeking new negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can make some modifications that can be accepted by the EPA, that's 
what we want to do," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), another negotiator, said, "Every 
day counts. We've already lost four to five months," Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, EPA officials said their negotiators are flexible. Spokeswoman 
Denise Graveline said a centralized network of facilities that would only test 
vehicles -- not repair them -- was now considered merely one option on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 She said acceptable alternatives could include routing newer cars to garages 
for both testing and repair, if necessary. Other cars would go to test-only 
stations and return to those facilities after repairs for a second test.

STANLEY ADAMS; HIT LYRICIST, ASCAP CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stanley Adams, a lyricist whose words to songs placed them high among the 
nation's hits during World War II and whose presidency of ASCAP featured 
transitions from ballads to blues to bop, died Thursday in Manhasset, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the American Society of Composers Authors & Publishers, said 
Adams was 86 and died after a short illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Known nationally as author of the hit "What a Difference a Day Makes," 
recorded by Andy Russell, Dinah Washington and Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, Adams 
was first elected ASCAP president in 1953.He served three years and was 
reelected in 1959, serving until 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure, ASCAP joined the national trend toward country-Western 
music, opening an office in Nashville, helped lead a congressional revision of 
U.S. copyright laws and signed a joint royalty agreement with the Soviet Union 
that provided payment to U.S. and Soviet composers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a lyricist, Adams experienced overnight success, teaming up with Fats 
Waller on one of his first songs, the hit "Rollin' Down the River."

DAVID CHANDLER; PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING REPORTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Leon Chandler, successful author and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, 
has died at his home in Denver. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler died Sunday of complications from diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Covington, Ky., Chandler attended Boston College and served in the 
Navy and the merchant marine before going to work for the News-Herald in Panama 
City, Fla., in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 He headed a News-Herald team that won the 1962 Pulitzer for public service for 
a series of stories exposing corruption in the local sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler later worked for the New Orleans States-Item and then became a 
free-lance writer, working for Life, Time, People, Rolling Stone and the 
Associated Press. He had most recently worked for Westword, a weekly newspaper 
in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote seven books, mostly historical and biographical. Among them were 
"Henry Flagler: The Astonishing Life and Times of the Visionary Robber Baron 
Who Founded Florida" in 1986 and his controversial "The Binghams of Louisville" 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bingham family, which owned the prestigious Louisville Courier-Journal for 
several generations, was so upset with Chandler's book that it briefly blocked 
publication with a copyright challenge to the use of historical material. 
Chandler's book theorized about the murder of Henry Flagler's daughter, Mary 
Bingham, whose fortune was used to buy the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler's book "The Jefferson Conspiracies: A President's Role in the 
Assassination of Meriwether Lewis" is scheduled to be published in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The author's colorful career included running unsuccessfully for governor of 
Louisiana in an attempt to prove a candidate could win without accepting 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler is survived by his third wife, Mary, and four children, Bayou of New 
Orleans, David of Wollaston, Mass., Clayton of Boston, and John Henry of Costa 
Mesa.

MARTIN KOSLECK; ACTOR RECOGNIZED FOR NAZI ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Kosleck, the German-born film character actor who portrayed dozens of 
Nazis everyone loved to hate, but who said he never had the questionable honor 
of meeting one, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Drake, a longtime friend, said Kosleck, known for his icy demeanor 
and wicked eyes, was 89 when he died Jan. 16 in a Santa Monica convalescent 
home. He had undergone abdominal surgery a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For years before and after World War II, Kosleck epitomized the Nazi menace 
for millions of American moviegoers. He played SS troopers, concentration camp 
officers and mean-spirited German soldiers, all consumed with blind obedience 
to Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 He portrayed Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Kosleck was born in Barkotzen, Pomerania, now Germany. His German-Russian 
family traced its heritage to the 13th Century. He was 10 when he left his 
small village to study acting with Max Reinhardt in Berlin. He later went to 
Hollywood where he perfected his English and dined with such old Berlin friends 
as Marlene Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was an accomplished portrait artist and managed to support himself 
with his art while waiting for a break in movies. According to author Richard 
Lamparski, in one of his "Whatever Became of. . . ?" anthologies, Kosleck was 
finally discovered not in films but on the New York stage, where director 
Anatole Litvak saw him in "The Merchant of Venice" and cast him in a film that 
foretold things to come for his career: "Confessions of a Nazi Spy" in 1939. It 
was his first link with Goebbels. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next decade he was the evil spy, double agent or Gestapo despot in 
"Underground," "All Through the Night," "Chetniks," "Berlin Correspondent," 
"The Hitler Gang" and other films. His piercing stare made him a natural for 
other psychopaths in "The Mad Doctor," "She Wolf of London" and "The Frozen 
Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview with Lamparski, Kosleck said he had never met Goebbels. In 
fact, he said, "I've never spoken with a Nazi in my life. . . . The fools were 
all over the streets of Berlin when I left in 1931. No one I knew took them 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 His last performance was a small part in "The Man With Bogart's Face" in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 He was married to the actress Eleonora von Mendelssohn, who died several years 
ago. There are no immediate survivors, Drake said.

N.V. OGARKOV; FORMER SOVIET MILITARY CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marshal Nikolai V. Ogarkov, who ordered the downing of a South Korean airliner 
that strayed into Soviet airspace in 1983, has died at the age of 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogarkov died Sunday of an undisclosed illness. 
</P>
<P>
 The official obituary in the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, or Red Star, 
said Ogarkov "dedicated himself to selfless service to the motherland and to 
consolidation of the combat might of the armed forces." 
</P>
<P>
 Ogarkov, while he was chief of staff of the Soviet armed forces, won notoriety 
in 1983 for explaining to the West the downing of Korean Airlines Flight 007 
when it flew off course and crossed over Soviet territory. All 269 crew members 
and passengers died. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogarkov insisted that his forces were certain the airliner was a spy plane.

EXTENT OF DAMAGE IS AMAZING, SHE SAYS. MRS. CLINTON ALSO TAKES PART IN CRISIS 
COUNSELING SESSION AT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton got a firsthand look Thursday at Los Angeles 
earthquake damage and said she was stunned by what she saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am amazed at the damage that I'm seeing on this one street," the First Lady 
said after touring a badly damaged Hollywood neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intensity of the experience, I think, can't even be described," she said. 
"I'm also very impressed by the spirit of the people and the cooperation 
between all the different levels of government." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton, whose trip to Los Angeles was planned before the Jan. 17 quake, 
made her first stop at Hyde Park Boulevard Elementary School, where she 
participated in a quake crisis counseling session with a small group of 
children and teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is an experience they keep living over and over again," she said after 
meeting with students at the South-Central Los Angeles campus for about half an 
hour.  
</P>
<P>
 "At least they're talking about it, they're writing about it," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 After a natural disaster, schools must reopen as soon as possible "to give 
them some sense of security," the First Lady said. "Getting back to their usual 
routines is very significant for students."  
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton was accompanied by James Lee Witt, director of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, as she toured a residential neighborhood in 
Hollywood where bungalows built about 80 years ago were severely damaged in the 
magnitude 6.6 quake.  
</P>
<P>
 The houses were pushed off their foundations, porches collapsed and water and 
gas service had not been restored. The area has since suffered more damage from 
the aftershocks that continue to rumble through the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond O'Keefe, 53, and his 78-year-old mother-in-law told Clinton how they 
were driven out of their adjacent homes in the 6000 block of Selma Avenue by 
the quake. They have been camping in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody got out all right," Raymond O'Keefe said. "I never thought I'd have 
to use all (my) camping experience."  
</P>
<P>
 O'Keefe told Clinton that he, his wife and his mother-in-law have not been 
able to salvage their furniture because the quake twisted the two houses and 
jammed all the doors.  
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, he said, the family left his house through a dining room 
window.  
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton told reporters she chose not to visit the hard-hit San Fernando 
Valley, where the quake was centered, because "I don't think I have to go to 
every place to see what is happening."  
</P>
<P>
 But aides conceded that her stops in South-Central and Hollywood were designed 
to defuse criticism that her husband's visit last week focused attention 
exclusively on the Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents the Hollywood area, said 
5,000 people in that community were left homeless by the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the devastation in the San Fernando Valley, a lot of people have 
not noticed what's going on here," Goldberg said.  
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady was honored Thursday night at an entertainment industry gala at 
the Universal Amphitheatre in the Valley to benefit AIDS Project Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg received the seventh 
Commitment to Life awards presented by APLA to recognize those who work in the 
fight against the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady was cited for her health care reform proposals, which APLA 
executives have said are sensitive to AIDS issues.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FILLMORE GETS HELPING HAND FROM BARSTOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shocked by television images of quake victims and driven by a desire to help 
those in need, residents of Barstow have adopted the city of Fillmore, sending 
a truckload of donated goods that arrived in the city Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 students and residents spent the afternoon unloading hundreds of 
boxes of clothing, shoes, baby items, toiletries, food, dishes and furniture 
from a 28-foot-long trailer at Fillmore Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 They were joined later by at least 30 other residents who helped sort through 
the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God for the things those people have sent us. These are things that we 
need the most," said Ester de la Cruz, 46. "We lost everything, everything. But 
now we have hope." 
</P>
<P>
 The goods came in response to a plea from Peggy Glenn, principal of Fillmore 
Middle School and a former Barstow resident, to friends in her old hometown. 
Shortly after the Jan. 17 quake, Glenn said, she made a simple request of a 
former colleague: Could she ask people in the community to donate old clothing 
and personal items to the Fillmore quake victims? 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn was overwhelmed with the response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea that it would get this big," said Glenn, who worked as a 
teacher and administrator in Barstow schools for 18 years before she came to 
Fillmore. "It was fantastic to see the outpouring of charity from one community 
to another." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn said that when she first called her friend, the most she expected was a 
small van loaded with a few necessities, such as coats, sweaters and household 
goods. The shipment generated an outpouring of gratitude from Fillmore 
residents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barstow has a reputation as a little town with a big heart, and this just 
proves it," Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 72 hours after they heard about Fillmore's catastrophe, Barstow 
residents had collected hundreds of dollars in merchandise. A Barstow trucker 
donated the use of his rig, and another resident volunteered to pull the 
trailer to Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 After Glenn's request, flyers were distributed throughout Barstow. The local 
paper ran a story and by the afternoon of Jan. 21, residents were dropping 
merchandise off at one of the local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just adopted that town," said Barstow resident Sue Kelly, 57. "Everyone 
needs help at times in their lives. What happened to Fillmore can happen to any 
of us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The response to the relief effort was not only quick, but widespread, drawing 
help from many of Barstow's 21,000 residents, said Jane Sievers, 45, who 
organized the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never been so gratified with any volunteer program," Sievers said. "It 
has just been a real lesson in compassion and the joy of giving." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Barstow residents said they were pleased to know that whatever they gave 
would go directly to the people who needed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that the things that we send are going straight to the people, and 
that makes it so much more personal," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said that once she saw the flyers, she called all of her relatives who 
live in Barstow. In turn, her relatives called all of their friends. Suddenly, 
Kelly said she found herself picking up items all over town from those who were 
not able to drive to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a matter of hours," Kelly said, "and we were making trips around 
the city and picking up items to take to the school." 
</P>
<P>
 A touching moment for Kim Harris, 30, a dance teacher in Barstow, came when 
her two daughters, ages 5 and 9, voluntarily picked several of their newest 
toys and clothing to give away. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said the girls filled five large bags with toys, including three Barbie 
dolls, several new dresses and loaded up another two bags with teddy bears and 
other stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I watched them fill the bags, I had to hold back not to say, 'Are you 
sure?' It was hard to keep my mouth quiet," Harris said. "I got a thrill from 
seeing them giving some of their best clothing and toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were willing to give and that was a refreshing feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 If Barstow residents were anxious to give, Fillmore's residents were anxious 
to receive. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to really need those things when they get back to their 
homes," Glenn said as she sorted through boxes of glasses and plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing her students wearing the same outfit for several days was one of the 
reasons that prompted Glenn to ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who lived in Fillmore's more than 500 residences declared uninhabitable 
after the quake now have to rely on federal loans and donations to rebuild 
their lives, said Noreen Withers, Fillmore's city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they sorted through boxes and bags, Fillmore residents found not only 
basic items such as hairbrushes and toothpaste, but extra amenities, including 
a box of women's makeup and nail polish. 
</P>
<P>
 The goods are to be distributed to the community today by the Red Cross with 
the help of students from Fillmore Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 The coming together of communities is one of the greatest gifts of any 
disaster, Withers said. "It is heartwarming that people in our state care about 
us to this extent."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; NAVY'S HELP SOUGHT FOR NEW TRAIN STATION; 
TRANSPORTATION: REGIONAL RAIL AUTHORITY HAS FORMALLY ASKED SEABEES TO BUILD THE 
METROLINK PROJECT IN CAMARILLO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regional transportation officials have asked thS. Navy Seabees to build a 
proposed Camarillo Metrolink station and begin construction as soon as next 
week, one of the county's top transit officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Regional Rail Authority, which runs Metrolink trains 
to downtown Los Angeles, formally asked the Navy on Wednesday to help with the 
emergency construction project to relieve traffic on the region's quake-damaged 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Seabees are amazing," said Mary Travis, manager of transit systems for 
the Ventura County Transportation Commission. "I understand they actually 
constructed one of the stations in 48 hours from the ground up." 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokeswoman at the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme 
said local Seabee officials have not received any request for a construction 
job in Camarillo. But she noted that Port Hueneme-based Naval Construction 
Battalion Center 40 is building a similar Metrolink project near Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis said Metrolink officials have already designed an emergency commuter 
train station to be built near Lewis Road and Ventura Boulevard. Using a 
similar layout at other emergency Metrolink stations built since the Jan. 17 
quake, construction could be complete in as little as two weeks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under normal, non-emergency conditions, Metrolink stations take between four 
and six months to complete, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that it took an earthquake to make this happen, but we're 
excited that with a station, we'll finally start being able to get people out 
of their cars," said Dan Greeley, Camarillo's director of engineering services. 
"It's my understanding that work could begin as early as next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Greeley said plans for the no-frills station called for grading and striping a 
vacant lot adjacent to the tracks for about 240 cars, and installing lighting 
and a passenger drop-off zone off the facility's main driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Extension of Metrolink service into Camarillo will be considered by a 
subcommittee of the Regional Rail Authority during a meeting today in Los 
Angeles, Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is approved, the Ventura County Transportation Commission would release 
between $250,000 and $500,000 to pay for construction costs at the proposed 
station. Development of the Camarillo station and a possible 12-mile extension 
to the Oxnard Transportation Center is sought to ease post-earthquake 
congestion on the Simi Valley and Ventura freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be talking prices with the committee and seeking assurances that we 
will be getting federal disaster fund reimbursement, but I think we're all 
agreed that Camarillo is a go," Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that the possibility of extending Metrolink service into Oxnard will 
also be discussed during today's meeting with rail officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's on the agenda," Travis said. "It's a logical extension. The track from 
Camarillo is straight and fast into Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo officials applauded news that construction on the station would 
start soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Charlotte Craven said that once built, the interim station may 
well become a permanent fixture in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing so permanent as a temporary building in government parlance," 
Craven said. "This is going to be a welcome addition to our city." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael Morgan, who himself rides Metrolink several days a week to 
his job in Los Angeles, said the train may be another way for Camarillo 
residents to explore downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of really neat galleries and restaurants there that I think 
our residents would enjoy visiting," Morgan said. "With the free shuttles that 
are waiting there, people can get around down there without any hassles at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Hidalgo, a Metrolink spokesman, said ridership from Ventura County's 
existing stations in Moorpark and Simi Valley is up 30% over normal, pre-quake 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more commuters are for the first time seeing the possibilities of 
taking the train," Hidalgo said. "It's a trend that's benefiting everyone."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FEWER QUAKE VICTIMS SEEKING FEDERAL HELP; 
RELIEF: MANY HARD-HIT VENTURA COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE TURNING TO PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Since the devastating earthquake tore through Ventura County 11 days ago, 
5,180 people have sought federal assistance, and nearly 100 people have applied 
for food stamps and welfare, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley and Fillmore, areas of the county hit hardest by the quake, the 
number of victims seeking help at two disaster relief centers began to let up, 
but only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Simi Valley estimated that they had processed nearly 700 
applications for aid on Wednesday alone, while about 100 people sought help in 
Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a steady flow of people," said Lynne Keating, a worker at the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency center in Fillmore. "Some people are under 
dire straits because they have lost so much." 
</P>
<P>
 For many Ventura County residents, last week's earthquake left them in such a 
precarious financial position that they have had to seek public aid for the 
first time in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Thursday, 53 people have sought welfare and food stamps in Simi Valley. 
In Fillmore, 76 people filed for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Reburn, a deputy director with the county Public Social Services Agency, 
said local officials have been working alongside federal workers at the 
disaster centers to take welfare and food stamp applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the people who have to use their resources to pay for damaged homes, this 
means that much less money to buy food," Reburn said. "There are some people 
without any income at all because they have lost their jobs because of all of 
this. (Food stamps) are just an additional resource for help." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, Nathalie Milliken went to the disaster assistance center at St. 
Francis of Assisi Church on California 126 to apply for food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 A research technician for the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port 
Hueneme, Milliken has never needed help buying groceries before. But the Jan. 
17 earthquake damaged her single-family home so badly that city inspectors 
declared it safe only for limited entry until repairs are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Milliken, 44, has had to take unpaid leave from work the past two weeks to 
clean up the house and line up a contractor. She had already used her paid 
leave to care for her 98-year-old grandmother who lives with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she plans to return to work Monday, she's afraid that the two weeks 
without pay may cause her to run low on cash for food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the circumstances, I know I'm going to need help," Milliken said. "I 
just didn't want to leave myself or my grandmother without having things to 
eat." 
</P>
<P>
 The bustle of previous days had subsided slightly by Thursday afternoon at 
Simi Valley's FEMA center, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We crested today," FEMA spokesman Bob Mullins said. "We're still generally 
busy in the morning, but from 1 to 5, people can just walk right in." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the slowdown, counselors from the Ventura County Mental Health 
Department have been busy talking with people about their fears and 
frustrations in the temblor's wake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aftershocks prevented people from starting the healing process and moving 
forward to take care of things," said Carol Williams, one of several health 
workers staffing the corner counseling table. "They figured, 'Why should I 
bother cleaning up?' " 
</P>
<P>
 To make life a little easier on the applicants, federal officials have agreed 
to open a second disaster center in Simi Valley. Starting at 1 p.m. today, 
residents can apply for assistance at the Ronald Reagan Center for Public 
Affairs, 40 Presidential Drive, off Madera Road. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, former President Reagan said: "Nancy and I called the 
library right away to see what we could do -- how we could help. We're pleased 
they've accepted our invitation to use the facility." 
</P>
<P>
 While federal and local officials continued to process applications for 
assistance, Red Cross officials said the number of people staying at emergency 
shelters is starting to drop. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday night, 154 people sought refuge at Fillmore Middle School and 
87 stayed at the Hillside Junior High School shelter in Simi Valley, the Red 
Cross said. Officials were expecting similar numbers Thursday night. Last week, 
nearly 600 people were staying at four shelters in the Fillmore and Simi Valley 
areas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping the numbers will continue to decline," said Brian Bolton, 
executive director of the Ventura County chapter of the Red Cross. "People are 
doing the best they can to move on."

BOY CAUGHT IN MIDDLE OF OXNARD PAWNSHOPS' FEUD; 13-YEAR-OLD SUED, INVESTIGATED 
AFTER REPORTING TIRE-SLASHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, 11-year-old Jesus Garcia told police that he saw a man with a 
Rottweiler slash a tire in a parking lot along Oxnard Boulevard, then bolt away 
down an alley. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy says he reported the incident because he thought that it was the right 
thing to do. Now he wishes that he'd just kept quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Jesus and his mother, Estella Garcia, are being sued by the man 
police arrested and have found themselves in the middle of a long-running feud 
between two Oxnard Boulevard pawnshops. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you try to teach your kids to be good citizens, this is what happens. 
You get penalized," said Estella Garcia, 38, who works for Ventura County 
processing welfare applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any money. How am I going to defend myself?" she asked. "That's 
why I worry, even though I know what we're saying is true." 
</P>
<P>
 The truck whose tire was slashed belonged to an employee of Get-Mor Loan & 
Jewelry. Based on Jesus' identification, Robert Wademan -- owner of the 
neighboring Saul's Loan & Jewelry -- was charged with misdemeanor vandalism in 
September, 1992. But prosecutors dropped the charge a year later, saying they 
doubted that they could get a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The two businesses have a long history of acrimonious relations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Get-Mor's owners, Steven and Morris Funk, sued Wademan, alleging 
unfair business tactics. They accused him and his employees of making 
anti-Semitic slurs, blaring loud Christmas music and positioning a robot to 
intimidate customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wademan countersued, and a Ventura County Superior Court judge issued a 
restraining order against both businesses, telling them to leave each other 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a police official familiar with the tension between the businesses 
wonders whether Wademan's suit against the Garcias is not rooted in the 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion is that they (filed suit) to put pressure on the Garcias to force 
them to change their story . . . and that would allow Wademan to sue Get-Mor 
Loan," said Oxnard Police Detective Len Newcomb, who investigated the 
tire-slashing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Said Steven Funk, who is a reserve Oxnard police officer: "In my opinion, 
they're trying to say the kid was put up to it by us." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wademan's attorney, Peter Goldenring, denies any hidden motives. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not true," he said. "The lawsuit is as we have pled it. No more, no 
less. It stands on its own." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Dec. 30 in Ventura County Superior Court, seeks more than 
$250,000 in damages from the Garcias. It accuses Jesus Garcia of lying to 
police and of conspiring to damage Wademan's business. And it accuses Estella 
Garcia of negligent supervision of a child for allowing her son to name Wademan 
as the tire-slasher. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldenring would not say with whom he believes the boy conspired, or what the 
boy's motive was. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we know is that this boy gave false testimony to the police and to the 
district attorney's office," Goldenring said. "That's just not OK in our 
society. Otherwise, we'd all have to run around defending ourselves against 
false charges." 
</P>
<P>
 No hearing has been scheduled on the suit. Estella Garcia said she expects to 
file a response today. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they dropped the vandalism case against Wademan, prosecutors said 
they don't think that Jesus was lying. Part of the problem was that shortly 
after the slashing, Steve Funk showed Jesus a videotape of Wademan, before the 
boy picked him out in a police photo lineup. Had Wademan gone to trial, his 
attorney could have argued that the photo lineup was tainted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't question the boy's credibility," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard 
Simon, who handled the case. "I just don't believe we could have proved beyond 
a reasonable doubt" that Wademan was guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon added that lawsuits like Wademan's make witnesses to crimes reluctant to 
come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me the kid was just a witness, trying to do his best to remember 
things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus, who is now 13 and lives in Port Hueneme, said he does not remember 
seeing Funk's videotape. But he is steadfast in his account of the 
tire-slashing, which occurred the afternoon of April 27, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was with his mother on the way to a jewelry store near the 
pawnshops when a man walking through the parking lot with a Rottweiler caught 
his eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested in the dog, Jesus continued watching as the man suddenly ducked 
between a red pickup truck and a van. Then he heard a loud pop, like a gunshot. 
And he saw the man running, carrying what looked like a knife, into an 
alleyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the jewelry store, the Garcias asked who owned the truck. When they 
returned to their van, they saw two men loading a TV into the disabled truck 
and shaking their heads. One of them was Get-Mor manager Randy Wiggins, who 
owned the truck. The Garcias told them what Jesus had seen and police were 
called. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Garcias said they had never before met Wiggins, the Funks or others 
connected with either pawnshop. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 21 months, the Garcias have made numerous court appearances, and 
Jesus has been questioned twice by a private investigator working for Wademan's 
attorney, including once at the Port Hueneme Boys Club where he goes after 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus said he never expected that reporting the tire-slashing to police would 
lead to such a hassle. "I thought I was just going to tell them and that was 
it. But after all this . . . I won't say nothing" if he should witness another 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's sticking to his story. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think just because I'm a kid I can't say the truth. But I'm going to 
stand by my word," he said.

CAMARILLO JOINS BID TO GET SALES TAX FUNDS FOR MORE POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Camarillo officials have joined a small group of Ventura County municipal 
leaders demanding that the county share revenues derived from the Proposition 
172 half-cent sales tax to add police patrols in their respective cities. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are considering spending most of those sales tax revenues to 
pay for the Todd Road jail under construction near Santa Paula and for 
increases in sheriff's patrols in unincorporated areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Wednesday night's meeting, the Camarillo City Council agreed to push 
supervisors to allow at least a part of the estimated $1.8 million of the sales 
taxes generated in Camarillo to remain in the city to hire more officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that Ventura County revenues from the levy could top $26 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the majority of crimes occur in the cities, the majority of people live 
in the cities and the majority of revenues to hire police officers are 
generated in cities, we believe that some formula should be developed to share 
a portion of the extra dollars with the cities," City Manager Bill Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, California voters agreed to make permanent a temporary half-cent 
sales tax increase, with the understanding that the money be used for public 
safety. Officials said Camarillo voters approved the new tax by a 56% majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Little said he sent a letter to County Supervisor Maggie Kildee on Jan. 12, 
asking her to consider the city's request. So far, Kildee has not responded. 
She could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo now pays $4.4 million to the Ventura County Sheriff's Department to 
provide police services in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Schillo, a Thousand Oaks city councilman and a candidate for the Board 
of Supervisors, applauded the Camarillo proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I believe that what the sheriff is planning to do with that money will 
help all Ventura County cities, I still would like the cities to get a portion 
of that back," Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton has proposed a slightly different way to share 
the sales tax with cities. He suggests that the tax revenues be used to 
eliminate his city's debt to the county for jail-booking fees. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that by having the county pay the booking fees, his city and others 
could pay for more police by using a city reserve fund that has been set aside 
as a result of a lawsuit over jail-booking fees between the cities and the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, the cities have accrued a bill of nearly $900,000 by refusing to 
pay the fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd prefer to see (the county) pay the fees," Stratton said. "I think that 
way we could use the money to put more cops on the street right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo officials said they believed that their city's voters would not have 
supported the initiative had they known their vote would not mean an increase 
in their city's public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a matter of trust," City Councilwoman Charlotte Craven said. "If that 
trust is betrayed, they'll never support anything like this ever again." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ken Gose agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt in my mind that the voters wouldn't have passed this if they 
had thought it wouldn't help them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Cmdr. Ray Abbott, who doubles as Camarillo's police 
chief, said that even half of the city's sales tax revenue -- $900,000 -- could 
mean that five additional officers could be hired and put on patrol in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping short of ordering an all-out publicity campaign, members of the 
council instructed Little to wait until early next month, then contact Kildee 
again to sound out where she stands on the city's request.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FEWER VICTIMS ARE SEEKING U. S. AID; RELIEF: 
MANY HARD-HIT VENTURA COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE TURNING TO PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As emergency crews worked round-the-clock in efforts to shore up quake-damaged 
buildings in Fillmore and Simi Valley, the number of victims seeking help at 
disaster relief centers began to let up slightly, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the devastating earthquake tore through Ventura County 11 days ago, 
5,180 people have sought federal assistance, and nearly 100 people have applied 
for food stamps and welfare, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Simi Valley estimated that they had processed nearly 700 
applications for aid on Wednesday alone, while about 100 people sought help in 
Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a steady flow of people," said Lynne Keating, a worker at the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency center in Fillmore. "Some people are under 
dire straits because they have lost so much." 
</P>
<P>
 For many Ventura County residents, last week's earthquake left them in such a 
precarious financial position that they have had to seek public aid for the 
first time in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Thursday, 53 people have sought welfare and food stamps in Simi Valley. 
In Fillmore, 76 people filed for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Reburn, a deputy director with the county Public Social Services Agency, 
said local officials have been working alongside federal workers at the 
disaster centers to take welfare and food stamp applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the people who have to use their resources to pay for damaged homes, this 
means that much less money to buy food," Reburn said. "There are some people 
without any income at all because they have lost their jobs because of all of 
this. (Food stamps) are just an additional resource for help." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, Nathalie Milliken went to the disaster assistance center at St. 
Francis of Assisi Church on California 126 to apply for food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 A research technician for the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port 
Hueneme, Milliken has never needed help buying groceries before. But the Jan. 
17 earthquake damaged her single-family home so badly that city inspectors 
declared it safe only for limited entry until repairs are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Milliken, 44, has had to take unpaid leave from work the past two weeks to 
clean up the house and line up a contractor. She had already used her paid 
leave to care for her 98-year-old grandmother who lives with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she plans to return to work Monday, she's afraid that the two weeks 
without pay may cause her to run low on cash for food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the circumstances, I know I'm going to need help," Milliken said. "I 
just didn't want to leave myself or my grandmother without having things to 
eat." 
</P>
<P>
 The bustle of previous days had subsided slightly by Thursday afternoon at 
Simi Valley's FEMA center, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We crested today," FEMA spokesman Bob Mullins said. "We're still generally 
busy in the morning, but from 1 to 5, people can just walk right in." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the slowdown, counselors from the Ventura County Mental Health 
Department have been busy talking with people about their fears and 
frustrations in the temblor's wake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aftershocks prevented people from starting the healing process and moving 
forward to take care of things," said Carol Williams, one of several health 
workers staffing the corner counseling table. "They figured, 'Why should I 
bother cleaning up?' " 
</P>
<P>
 To make life a little easier on the applicants, federal officials have agreed 
to open a second disaster center in Simi Valley. Starting at 1 p.m. today, 
residents can apply for assistance at the Ronald Reagan Center for Public 
Affairs, 40 Presidential Drive, off Madera Road. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, former President Reagan said: "Nancy and I called the 
library right away to see what we could do -- how we could help. We're pleased 
they've accepted our invitation to use the facility." 
</P>
<P>
 While federal and local officials continued to process applications for 
assistance, Red Cross officials said the number of people staying at emergency 
shelters is starting to drop. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday night, 154 people sought refuge at Fillmore Middle School and 
87 stayed at the Hillside Junior High School shelter in Simi Valley, the Red 
Cross said. Officials were expecting similar numbers Thursday night. Last week, 
nearly 600 people were staying at four shelters in the Fillmore and Simi Valley 
areas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping the numbers will continue to decline," said Brian Bolton, 
executive director of the Ventura County chapter of the Red Cross. "People are 
doing the best they can to move on."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 4 CHARGED IN FATAL SHOOTING AT MOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men and one woman were charged Thursday in connection with a fatal 
shooting at a Ventura motel last month.  
</P>
<P>
 Paul Martinez, 21, was gunned down Dec. 18 on the second-story balcony of the 
Motel 6 on Johnson Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Bruce A. Clark set bail at $1 million for Shaun T. Bolo, 20; 
his brother, Willard M. Bolo, 23, and Steven F. Hidalgo Jr., 20. Each is 
charged with murder. The Bolos are from Oxnard and Hidalgo from Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Bail was set at $250,000 for Naomi C. Honohan, 19, of Port Hueneme. She is 
charged with being an accessory for trying to help cover up the slaying, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case had been a mystery until Ventura police developed leads that led to 
raids on 12 residences and eight cars in Oxnard and Port Hueneme last week, 
Hardy said. The raids involved more than 115 officers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid it was going to be unsolved, afraid we weren't going to charge 
anybody," Hardy said. "This was a beautiful piece of police work." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Martinez was at the motel celebrating his discharge from the 
Army with several friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants -- members of street gangs in Oxnard and Port Hueneme, 
according to Hardy -- were at a different party at the motel. Martinez argued 
briefly with the defendants and was shot as he stood on the balcony, Hardy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said at least two gunmen opened fire from inside their cars in 
the motel's parking lot. He would not identify which two are believed to have 
been the shooters. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a bullet went through Martinez's left arm and pierced his heart, 
killing him instantly. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; DENTIST IS NAMED CHAMBER PRESIDENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Port Hueneme dentist has been named president of the Port Hueneme Chamber of 
Commerce, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Turner, who owns a dental practice on Pleasant Valley Road, will 
lead the city's Chamber of Commerce for a one-year term, said Pat Zanuzoski, 
the business group's executive manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner was installed during a dinner Wednesday at the Mandalay Beach Resort in 
Oxnard. Brady Cherry, director of Port Hueneme's recreation and community 
services department, was named citizen of the year at the same dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherry received the honor because he has shown "social responsibility" for the 
residents of Port Hueneme during the five years he has worked for the city, 
Zanuzoski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherry established the city's senior appreciation day, when senior volunteers 
are treated to a hot meal and given awards, Zanuzoski said. Cherry spends his 
own money to pay for the parties, Zanuzoski added. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 2 FINALISTS NAMED TO HEAD NEW SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Ventura elementary school principals have been chosen as the leading 
contenders to head a proposed back-to-basics school in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan I. Munday, principal of Poinsettia School, is the first choice to run the 
school that Ventura officials hope to launch in the fall, district Personnel 
Director Gerald Dannenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Montano, principal of Will Rogers School, is the alternate. 
</P>
<P>
 Munday and Montano have agreed to accept the job if chosen, Dannenberg said. 
Meanwhile, both will serve on a committee of district staff, parents and 
community members to form a plan for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned by Supt. Joseph Spirito, the back-to-basics school will replace 
one of the district's 17 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to having stricter discipline and a more stringent dress code than 
other district schools, the new school will require every parent to volunteer a 
certain number of hours each week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannenberg said school officials chose Munday from a handful of candidates for 
the principal's job because he demonstrated the greatest enthusiasm for the 
back-to-basics educational format. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials may choose Montano if they decide to locate the new 
school in a primarily Spanish-speaking neighborhood. Montano is bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to have some flexibility," Dannenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and community members interested in serving on the committee to launch 
the school should call Dannenberg at 652-7287. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; COUNCIL OKS $40,000 FOR NEW GENERATOR

<P>
 Although the city of Ojai was spared from major damage in the recent 
earthquake, the City Council is taking no chances that it will lose electricity 
during future emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bids for a new generator at City Hall will go out within weeks, with the City 
Council approving spending $40,000 to upgrade emergency systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifications for the new generator call for a 40,000-volt unit -- four times 
the size of the existing system -- to be purchased and installed at City Hall. 
The existing 10,000-volt system will be moved to the Jack Boyd Community 
Center, a city-owned recreation center at 510 Park Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have enough power to run City Hall in an emergency, but the key is the 
Boyd Center because that's really an emergency shelter," Mayor Steve Olsen 
said. "It's money well spent." 
</P>
<P>
 Like almost everywhere else in Ventura County, the city of Ojai and City Hall 
lost power for about 10 hours as a result of the 6.6 temblor that struck 
Northridge last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan approved by the City Council also calls for installation of a 
security and fire-alarm system at City Hall at a cost of about $3,400. JEFF

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District is seeking applicants to 
finish a portion of the term of a director who resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 John D. Dell'Amico resigned Jan. 12 with nearly three years left on his 
four-year term, citing personal reasons and frustration over the district's 
inability to complete more projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell'Amico, 61, said he plans to move to the Northern California community of 
Mt. Shasta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Camarillo was a sleepy little town of 8,000 when I moved here in 1961," he 
said. "Now it's getting too congested." 
</P>
<P>
 Dell'Amico was elected to the district's board of directors in 1984 and 
reelected twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is seeking a qualified applicant to replace Dell'Amico until 
November, when an election will be held for a replacement to serve the 
remaining two years, said Eldred Lokker, the district's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 An applicant must be an eligible voter who lives in or owns property in the 
park district. Applicants should submit a letter of interest, along with a 
resume and other pertinent information, to the board of directors by Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications may be sent to the Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District, 
Camarillo Community Center, 1605 E. Burnley St., Camarillo 93010. PATRICK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUPLE PLANTS TREES AT PARK AS MEMORIAL

<P>
 At a high point of land in Grant Park with a view of the entire Ventura 
coastline, Jo Ellen Lay and her husband, Gary, planted trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple have volunteered to care for the picnic site where they've planted 
25 trees, each one in memory of a deceased relative. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we planted the first trees, we came out here with all the family -- our 
son and daughters and five grandchildren -- and dropped notes into the ground 
in memory of their great-grandmother who had died," Jo Ellen Lay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since planting those trees in April, the Lays have carried water twice a week 
to the saplings. Thursday, they planted 22 more trees and plan on carrying 
water up to the site until the young pines can survive on their own. The Lays 
said they hope that when the trees are big enough to provide shade, the city 
will build benches nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "What better way to remember a loved one," Lay said. "It would be wonderful if 
other people could take the idea. The park needs the volunteers, and the trees 
would make the world a nicer place." SCOTT HADLY

 Ventura County sheriff's deputies and agents from the FBI arrested a Moorpark 
man for allegedly dealing in marijuana out of his apartment, Sheriff's Sgt. 
Gary Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Siamak Salehi, 28, was arrested Thursday afternoon after a two-week 
surveillance by officers who reported witnessing several drug buys, Pentis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Salehi, sheriff's deputies arrested three other people seen 
purchasing drugs, Pentis said. Enrique Castaneda, 29; Amber Tanner, 18, and 
Jose Lopez, 18, all of Thousand Oaks, were cited on possession of marijuana and 
released, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon searching Salehi's apartment, detectives discovered about 12 pounds of 
marijuana with an estimated street value of $36,000, a small quantity of 
psilocybin mushrooms and anabolic steroids, Pentis said. Detectives also 
reported finding a .38-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Salehi, a convicted felon, was booked at the County Jail on suspicion of 
selling marijuana, illegal possession of dangerous drugs and felony possession 
of a handgun, Pentis said. Salehi's bail is set at $20,000. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NEW BILLBOARDS WARN WORKERS' COMP CHEATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney's office Thursday unveiled four 
billboards promising tough action against workers' compensation fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the billboards is deterrence," said Frederick Bysshe Jr., past 
president of the Ventura County Bar Assn. and a member of Workers' Compensation 
Fraud Prosecution Unit's advisory council. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is also "to make the general public aware that the district 
attorney's office has assigned an investigator and a prosecuting attorney to a 
specialized unit that is concentrating on workers' comp fraud," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards, which show a fist slamming down a gavel, have bold yellow 
letters that warn: "We'll Nail Workers' Comp Cheaters." 
</P>
<P>
 The signs bear Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's name and a phone number for 
people to report suspicious claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say workers' compensation fraud is the biggest problem facing 
employers in Ventura County and across the state. Since state and local 
crackdowns against the crime began in recent years, overall claims have 
decreased by up to 40%, according to figures from the California Workers' 
Compensation Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that efforts like our billboard program will reduce 
workers' compensation fraud even further," said Lee Ingraham, a member of the 
Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce and the advisory council. "Eliminating workers' 
compensation fraud is one of our highest priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 One billboard is at West 5th Street near Pacific Avenue in Oxnard. Another is 
on California 126 in Fillmore; the other two are in western Ventura County, 
Ingraham said. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 5 ROBBERY SUSPECTS ARRESTED AFTER 
CHASE

<P>
 An armed robbery at a Thousand Oaks electronics store ended with the arrest of 
five people following a pursuit into Los Angeles County, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery occurred about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday when four armed men forced a 
lone employee of the Circuit City on West Hillcrest Drive back into the store 
just as she was locking up for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers ordered the woman to lay on the floor and took cash from the 
office before fleeing.  
</P>
<P>
 A person near the store saw the robbers leaving and gave the car's description 
and license plate number to Ventura County sheriff's deputies. The car was 
spotted heading toward Los Angeles County and, after a brief pursuit, five 
suspects were arrested in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Griffin, 36; Marvin Moore, 28; Anthony Grady, 27; Keith McCalley, and a 
fifth suspect whose name was not immediately known were booked into the Ventura 
County Jail on suspicion of armed robbery. The five Los Angeles men were being 
held in lieu of $20,000 bail apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies in Thousand Oaks also responded to an armed robbery at the 
Black Angus restaurant on Thousand Oaks Boulevard about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two armed men entered the restaurant after it closed, told employees to get on 
the ground and stole cash from an office safe. They left the area on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is still under investigation. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN TOXIC WASTE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Thousand Oaks man who owned a now-defunct Simi Valley dyeing facility 
has pleaded guilty to felony charges in connection with illegal discharges of 
toxic waste into the sewers and environment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Virgil Bates, president and operator of Melody Knitting Mills, faces 
10 to 16 months in prison when he is sentenced April 4 in federal court, 
officials said.Bates, 54, pleaded guilty Jan. 18 to two felony violations of 
the federal Clean Water Act, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, also known as Travelin' West Textiles, had a long history of 
waste-water discharge violations with the city of Simi Valley through the 
1980s, federal prosecutor Marc S. Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Environmental Protection Agency began investigating in 1988, 
Harris said, adding that the EPA issued three cease-and-desist orders that 
year. The company eventually shut down rather than comply, he said. Bates was 
indicted last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this had gone to trial, the government would have called to testify expert 
toxicologists and chemists to say the chemicals this company was pouring into 
the system were extremely dangerous," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates is now living in Florida, Harris said. One of his employees, Kenneth 
Arthur Baber, 46, of Carson, also pleaded guilty to the federal charges, 
officials said. BRENDA DAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DINNER TO HONOR STATE LEGISLATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 500 friends and supporters of state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) 
are expected for a "lighthearted roast" in Oxnard on March 11 to pay tribute to 
the California legislator's 20 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hart's request, the event, sponsored by Democrats United, will be the only 
tribute dinner for him as he completes his final year in office, said Beverly 
O'Gorman, administrative assistant to Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make this a fun evening, one in which we can all remember the 
times and events that took place in the county over the years," O'Gorman said. 
"It seemed appropriate to acknowledge what he has contributed to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Hart's primary areas of interest were education and the environment, 
O'Gorman said. Hart carried legislation to set aside $7 million to buy a site 
for a four-year state university in Ventura County and fought to protect funds 
despite a years-long delay in securing an acceptable site. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart has also carried several bills on recycling, including one that increased 
the redemption value for beverage containers, a move that "really got the 
program kicked into high gear," O'Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the price of tickets to the dinner down, the Oxnard High School jazz 
band will perform the music and Bob Guillen, executive secretary of the Ventura 
County Building and Construction Trades Council, will be chief cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) will be the evening's emcee. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $25 each or $200 for a table of eight. For tickets or information, 
call 648-7150, or mail checks to Democrats United, 2641 Loma Vista Road, 
Ventura 93003. JOANNA M. MILLER

WOMAN TELLS OF SEEING PIROLI TAKE MONEY FROM BANK BAG; COURTS: PARISH EDUCATOR 
TESTIFIES AT EMBEZZLEMENT TRIAL THAT SIMI VALLEY PRIEST PUT COLLECTION FUNDS 
INTO A PAPER SACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A parish educator testified Thursday that she once came upon Father David Dean 
Piroli as he pulled fistfuls of collection money from a bank bag and stuffed it 
into a paper sack in a back hallway at their Simi Valley church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Hello,' and he did not respond," said Mary Helen Phillips, education 
director at St. Peter Claver Church. "He just kept taking the money, looking at 
it and putting it in the paper bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said Piroli tried to explain the incident the next day, just a few 
weeks before his arrest on suspicion of embezzlement. He told her that he was 
moving the money for the head pastor, Father James McKeon, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'You saw me yesterday morning with a money bag,' " Phillips 
testified. " 'I was putting money in the paper sack for Father Jim. Father Jim 
has lost all the cloth bags, and I had to use a paper sack.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli, 37, is accused of skimming $60,000 in collection money from his Simi 
Valley parish and from his previous church, Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy. He 
is on trial in Ventura County Superior Court on two counts of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 After Piroli's arrest on May, 29, 1992, Phillips testified, she and other St. 
Peter Claver employees found thousands of dollars in cash in his rooms -- 
including Sacred Heart collection envelopes holding coins that children had 
given. 
</P>
<P>
 She ran to get the church's Polaroid camera and take pictures "in case no one 
would believe it," Phillips testified. "I was really shocked with the whole 
event." 
</P>
<P>
 The photos have been introduced as evidence, along with cloth bank bags found 
in Piroli's rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli earned a base monthly salary of $350, said Msgr. Timothy J. Dyer, vicar 
for clergy for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The priest probably earned up to $250 more per month from stipends -- fees 
that parishioners paid for special Masses that Piroli said, Dyer testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But after police in Hollywood found the priest in his church car surrounded by 
$10,000 in cash and traces of cocaine, Dyer summoned him to explain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he would (come), but he seemed surprised I wanted to see him -- which 
surprised me," Dyer testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "He began to speak as soon as he came in about what had happened," Dyer said. 
"He said that the money was his, and that it was money that he had saved up 
since his ordination -- that it was from stipends he'd received. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was his practice. He kept it in sacks (in) the back of his car because 
he didn't like to take it to the bank," Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dyer said Msgr. Terence Richey, another priest listening to Piroli's account, 
interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Msgr. Richey stopped at one point and said, 'David, I want you to know as we 
talk that up until now, the things you've told us to explain the money and 
evidence of cocaine in the car -- I just don't believe you,' " Dyer testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But Piroli insisted that he was innocent and that the money was from stipends 
he'd saved over the years, Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Piroli's arrest, he was visited in Ventura County Jail by Dyer 
and the head of the archdiocese, Cardinal Roger Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We visit any of our priests who are in jail. It doesn't happen very often, 
thanks be to God," Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But over two hours of conversation, Piroli repeatedly snubbed Mahony's 
requests for an explanation, Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Often joking, Piroli continually changed the subject and chattered about 
everyday occurrences "as if we weren't in jail," Dyer testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cardinal asked him, 'David, there's a lot of people that are affected by 
this, and a lot of people scandalized about this, and we need to address this,' 
" Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And (Piroli) said, 'I'm sorry; I'm advised by my counsel not to talk about 
that,' and he turned the discussion back to everyday things," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli also told the cardinal that he was worried that the jail interview room 
might be bugged, Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli said nothing in the discussion to set his mind at ease, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my opinion that there was something untrue in his story. What it was, 
I don't know," Dyer said. "I found his entire presentation, his affect in the 
time I spent with him, more than two hours, very bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination by defense attorney Richard Beada, Dyer said the 
diocese never received complaints about Piroli. But he said some parishioners 
had expressed fears to the diocese about the financial stability of St. Peter 
Claver. 
</P>
<P>
 During a break in testimony, Dyer walked over and warmly shook Piroli's hand. 
And when the vicar finished testifying, the two priests walked together down 
the courthouse hallway, chatting amiably. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony is scheduled to resume at 9:30 a.m. Monday before Judge Allan L. 
Steele.

PANEL BACKS MARQUEE FOR ARTS PLAZA; THOUSAND OAKS: COMMISSION RECOMMENDS A 
240-SQUARE-FOOT ELECTRONIC SIGN, ESTIMATED TO COST ABOUT $165,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks theater commissioners, reasoning that a massive, modern building 
requires a massive, modern sign, have recommended that a billboard-sized 
electronic marquee stand outside the new Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the City Council, the 240-square-foot sign would announce 
events taking place in both the performing arts and government portions of the 
$64-million complex. But commissioners emphasized that the messages would 
remain in place for days at a time and would not flash every few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated price tag of $165,000, the marquee would cost more than the 
controversial copper curtain, a flat sculpture designed to cascade down the 
eastern wall of the auditorium's 10-story tower. Building the marquee would 
cost nearly as much as the combined salaries of the performing arts center's 
executive director, technical production manager and box office manager for the 
upcoming year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the cost, the executive director, Tom Mitze, asked commissioners to 
consider a sign with movable letters -- similar to those announcing high school 
football games -- instead of an electronic board. The low-tech version would 
cost only $55,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a huge difference in price," Mitze noted. "And I think the movable 
letters would be a more acceptable style for Thousand Oaks because there are 
precedents." 
</P>
<P>
 But all seven members of the Civic Theaters Commission rejected that argument. 
Responsible for advising on Civic Arts Plaza policies, they endorsed the 
sleeker electronic board for placement on Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cringe at spending an extra $110,000, but I don't want to use antiquated 
technology," Commissioner Larry Janss said. "The City Council will certainly 
hear from people who are opposed to electronic signs, but that's their 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to hear the issue Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite unanimous support for the electronic reader board, one commissioner -- 
GTE West President Larry Sparrow -- voted against the proposed marquee because 
of its size. 
</P>
<P>
 City codes restrict signs on commercial parcels the size of the Civic Arts 
Plaza to a maximum of 48 square feet. The proposed marquee would be five times 
larger. Even for larger parcels, the maximum size allowable by law is 150 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, the City Council rejected a proposed Thousand Oaks Auto Mall 
message board that would have flashed advertisements and announcements three 
stories above the Ventura Freeway. Instead, the council allowed only a small 
electronic board displaying time and temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe very strongly that government imposes rules and government must 
follow those rules," Sparrow said. "We must adhere to city codes. It would be 
inappropriate for the city to do something it does not allow other citizens to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Sparrow's argument did not convince the other commissioners, who said a 
regulation-size sign would look puny and unbalanced in front of the bulky 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Commissioner Virginia Davis said, the City Council has already 
waived a handful of municipal codes for the Civic Arts Plaza and other public 
buildings, such as the teen and senior centers and the main library. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has made it very clear about all government buildings that they are 
different and can do differently," Davis said. "We have put a state-of-the-art 
theater in here, and we need a sign that reflects that."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FREE SCHOOL MEALS AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County children whose families had to leave their homes because of 
last week's earthquake can qualify for free school breakfasts and lunches, 
regardless of the family's income, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Child Nutrition Department will reimburse the cost to local school 
districts in counties declared federal disaster areas, officials said.Parents 
can request the meals simply by calling the child's school. 
</P>
<P>
 About 174 Simi Valley High School students have applied for the aid, but very 
few elementary school students have come forward, said Judy LaRossa, director 
of food services for the Simi Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the word hasn't gotten out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other Ventura County school district hardest hit by the 6.6 quake, 
Fillmore Unified, officials were not available to comment on the number of 
quake victims who have applied for the meals program.

TIMOTHY E. MILLER, FOUNDER OF AIDS WALK O.C., DIES AT 45 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Timothy E. Miller, a founder of AIDS Walk Orange County and former executive 
director of the service organization AIDS Response Program, died Wednesday of 
AIDS-related causes. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim really dedicated his energies for quite a few years to advocating for the 
rights of people who were HIV-affected and who were HIV-infected," said Jack 
Herzberg, program director for the Garden Grove-based AIDS Response Program. 
"His forthright leadership style in ending the epidemic will be sorely missed." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Miller moved from New Jersey to Laguna Beach, where he began working 
with the Police Department as a community services officer, a position he held 
until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller began work at the AIDS Response Program later that year, starting as a 
program specialist. He became executive director in 1989, a position he held 
until September, 1993, when illness forced his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his work with the service organization, which is a program of 
the Gay and Lesbian Community Service Center of Orange County, Miller was a 
founder of Laguna Outreach and the Elections Committee of the County of Orange 
in 1982, and of AIDS Walk Orange County in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is survived by his parents, Erwin and Elinor Miller of Virginia, and 
three brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral arrangements are pending. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that 
donations be made in Miller's memory to the AIDS Response Program, 12832 Garden 
Grove Blvd., Suite B, Garden Grove, Calif. 92843.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; OFFICIALS HOPE PRIZED ADOBES CAN BE RESTORED; 
LANDMARKS: THE QUAKE-DAMAGED HISTORIC SITES IN SIMI VALLEY AND NEAR PIRU WILL 
REQUIRE EXTENSIVE, COSTLY REPAIRS.

 Two of Ventura County's oldest structures were severely damaged in last week's 
earthquake, but state officials, historians and property owners are hopeful 
that the historic buildings can be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Strathearn House/Simi Adobe in Simi Valley and the adobe on the Camulos 
Ranch near Piru have withstood some of Southern California's worst earthquakes. 
But the one that struck Jan. 17 proved too much for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Strathearn House/Simi Adobe was awaiting seismic reinforcement for two of 
the adobe's walls when the quake struck. Those walls were badly damaged, a 
chimney was destroyed and holes were created in both buildings' roofs, said Pat 
Havens, Simi Valley historian and museum director for the Strathearn Historical 
Park and Museum. There was also extensive exterior cracking, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we are very lucky we didn't have more damage," Havens said. "It's 
just amazing to me that it's withstood this long, through this many quakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The adobe stands on a 1795 Spanish land grant, the earliest in the county, and 
is estimated to be at least 175 years old, Havens said. It is a county 
historical landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 The state landmark adobe on the Camulos Ranch suffered similar structural 
damage. Walls of the main house were cracked and in a few places collapsed. In 
one corner of a bedroom, the roof is precariously balancing on a 19th-Century 
chest of drawers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a historic treasure and we're desperately trying to preserve it," 
said Robert Lorenz, whose wife's family owns the ranch. Lorenz said the family 
wants to restore the ranch's 170-year-old adobe, but it's not going to be easy 
-- or cheap. Lorenz said it will cost $2 million just to restore the main 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camulos Ranch, which was originally known as Rancho San Francisco, was 
part of a 48,000-acre land grant issued to Antonio del Valle by the king of 
Spain in the early 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch was part of the mission chain, a stopover for nuns, priests and the 
occasional outlaw between the San Fernando and San Buenaventura missions. 
Joaquin Murrieta's saddlebags are alleged to be lying somewhere in the 
140-year-old winery, which was also damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an absolute necessity to get it repaired," said Steade Craigo, head of 
the state Office of Historic Preservation, who visited the Camulos Ranch and 
several other damaged landmarks in Ventura and Los Angeles counties last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage is pretty extensive; it is going to be expensive to repair those 
walls. It could be as high as $2 million," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Craigo, a historical architect, said it is important to restore the adobe 
because it still retains the historical character of the 1840s. "Due to its 
importance to the mission . . . we need to do everything that we can. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no real grant money available. I'm looking to see if we can get a 
special appropriation from Congress for this building and other adobes." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Craigo, Havens and the Lorenzes are hopeful that the historic structures 
they care about can be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Havens said the structural engineer who assessed the damage at the Strathearn 
House/Simi Adobe believed that the repair work needed would not be as extensive 
as first feared. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she didn't know how much the restoration would cost, but said the 
estimate to reinforce the adobe's walls before the earthquake was $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, I think we'll be better off than we were before," Havens 
said. "It certainly did prove what needed to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz said the earthquake has served as a catalyst for the family to restore 
the Camulos Ranch. On Thursday, Shirley Lorenz and her daughter, Anne Reinders, 
were replanting the rose garden -- a symbolic gesture, they said, in 
transforming the ranch back to what it once was. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider this to be the end of an era," Robert Lorenz said. "From this day 
forward, Camulos Ranch is going to be reborn."

BRUINS SWEAT IT OUT; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: STANFORD HANGS TOUGH, BUT EDNEY SCORES 
15 TO LEAD NO. 1 UCLA, 69-65. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 How does a No. 1 team win games? The way UCLA did it Thursday night was, well, 
barely. 
</P>
<P>
 On the occasion of their first game as the top-ranked team in the nation, the 
Bruins threw a scare into themselves by scoring exactly one basket in the last 
6:26, but held on long enough to defeat Stanford, 69-65. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got bogged down at the end, but those things happen," Coach Jim Harrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins remained undefeated at 14-0 (7-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference), but 
it didn't happen easily. They led by 13, 64-51, with 6:26 to play on Shon 
Tarver's driving layup, then spent the rest of the game trying not to land on 
the seats of their blue shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't as if UCLA's jerseys were a little tight around the collar, Ed 
O'Bannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hear more from you guys about No. 1 than what we say," he said. "The trick 
is to play just as hard, whether you're No. 1 or No. 101." 
</P>
<P>
 For a while in the second half, the Bruins played like both. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a 65-53 lead, the Bruins failed to score on their next six trips down 
the floor and Stanford got to within 65-62 with 1:19 left. 
</P>
<P>
 But George Zidek tipped in Ed O'Bannon's misfire, and two free throws by Tyus 
Edney with eight seconds left kept Stanford from catching up. 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek risked wiping out the play with an offensive foul, but outjumped 
six-foot guard Dion Cross to put in the tip. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a foot difference between us," Zidek said. "There was no way I could 
have fouled him." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Poppink, who has made only five three-pointers this season, tried one 
anyway after Edney missed the first half of a one-and-one with 21 seconds left 
and UCLA leading, 67-65. 
</P>
<P>
 But Poppink missed badly and fouled Edney, whose two free throws put it away. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney led the Bruins with 15 points and Ed O'Bannon had 12. UCLA's 69 points 
and 34 rebounds were both season lows. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Williams had 24 points for Stanford (10-5, 3-3). 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had won five consecutive games against Stanford, but Harrick did not have 
streaks on his mind. He had worries. He was concerned about what to do with 
Stanford's Brevin Knight. 
</P>
<P>
 His main problem was defense, as in who to send out on a Knight like this. 
Harrick selected Edney, mainly because Knight reminded him of Edney. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got Edney-like speed," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the half, the matchup was a push -- Edney had three points, Knight was 
scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were much bigger worries for Harrick, such as how to keep his front 
line from fouling out. Zidek, Charles O'Bannon and Rodney Zimmerman had three 
fouls in the first half, which ended in a 34-34 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Three minutes into the second half, Zidek and Zimmerman were on the bench with 
four fouls. Sophomore Ike Nwankwo filled in with 15 minutes, Harrick went to a 
zone to save anybody else from further foul trouble and despite back-to-back 
three-pointers from Williams, the Bruins actually prospered for awhile. 
</P>
<P>
 With 5:04 to play, UCLA's lead was 65-53, but just as suddenly as it appeared, 
the Bruins' advantage disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight wound up with two points, nine assists, eight steals and five 
turnovers, but he also missed a wide-open layup down the stretch and had 
another layup blocked by Charles O'Bannon. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's first threat in the backcourt since Todd Lichti left five years 
ago, Knight scored 17 points and had two three-pointers in last week's upset of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been glimmers of what was to come, notably a 23-point, 11-assist 
game against Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this game that caught the attention of Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck, I never heard of him until then," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford was unbeaten at home as it faced down UCLA, which was unbeaten 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Stanford fans didn't seem all that impressed. The shout from the 
student section was "Overrated!" It was a point well-taken, at least for a 
while, just before the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins went 5:20 with only two points, between Charles O'Bannon's jumper 
at 7:46 and Ed O'Bannon's hoop with 2:26 to go the only points that UCLA scored 
were on a hook by Zidek. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for UCLA was that Stanford was similarly feeble. UCLA lost an 
eight-point lead, but should have been buried and wasn't, probably because 
Stanford missed 20 of 32 shots in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he scored six points in the last two minutes of the half, Ed O'Bannon 
highlights were harder to find than hairs on his bald head. He had three 
turnovers and missed four of six free throws, two of them the front end of 
one-and-ones.

KINGS LOSE BY ONE GOAL, 1.5 SECONDS; PRO HOCKEY: RANGER MARK MESSIER TRICKLES 
IN WINNING GOAL IN OVERTIME AFTER FINAL FACEOFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 King goaltender Kelly Hrudey had stared down Ranger forward Tony Amonte on a 
penalty shot -- in overtime, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrudey made a glove save on Amonte with 10.7 seconds remaining and made it 
look easy to the delight of the sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum. The 
Rangers were awarded the penalty shot when the Kings made an illegal 
substitution with Tony Granato hopping off the bench when the Rangers were 
coming down the ice on a three on two. 
</P>
<P>
 End of game, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. Hrudey and the Kings heaved a sigh of relief a few seconds too early. 
There was the middling matter of a final faceoff in the Kings zone. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was worst-case scenario for the Kings as the Rangers scored with 1.5 
seconds left and left with a 5-4 victory on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything had gone so right for the Kings in the final period before disaster 
hit in the final seconds. Jari Kurri won the faceoff in the right circle and 
defenseman Rob Blake tried to clear the puck out, shooting it behind the net 
and sending it along the left boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Sergei Zubov beat King forward Shawn McEachern to the puck at the 
left point and launched a shot at the net. Ranger center Mark Messier, alert at 
the left post, jammed in the rebound and the puck trickled over the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Rangers, it was their fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers' owned the momentum in overtime, outshooting the Kings, 9-1, and, 
48-23, for the game. The Kings could not hang on for their third consecutive 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 What stood out for the Kings was an outstanding solo effort. There was Wayne 
Gretzky's astonishing goal in December -- a baseball-like drive as he picked 
the puck out of midair from about 30 feet out. Now there is an early nominee 
for best Kings' goal of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie center Robert Lang put on a dazzling, game-stopping end-to-end rush for 
his first career NHL goal, which pulled the Kings to a 4-4 tie at 15:47 of the 
third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang went through the entire Ranger team, carrying the puck out of the Kings' 
zone and maneuvering down the left wing. Two Ranger defensemen -- Zubov and 
Kevin Lowe made futile dives, but Lang shifted the puck to his backhand and 
flipped it between goaltender Mike Richter and the left post with a shot from 
the base of the circle. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd gave Lang a prolonged standing ovation. Lang was called up on Sunday 
from the minor-league team in Phoenix and this was his third game. He appeared 
in 11 games for the Kings last season. 
</P>
<P>
 First career NHL goals are always memorable, but Lang's effort was something 
special, like a Pavel Bure rush. 
</P>
<P>
 His effort went for naught, however. Was it possible to have one, two, three 
consecutive comebacks in the same week? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Not when the opposition is the New York Rangers. The Rangers simply do 
not lose when they lead a game after two periods -- at least not this season. 
They have compiled an astonishing 25-0-1 record when leading after two periods. 
In fact, they have fared quite well against the Kings recently, winning their 
last five meetings and nine of the previous 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Constantly playing from behind is risky in the long run. The Kings got away 
with it on Monday against Calgary and Winnipeg on Tuesday, pulling out ties in 
both games.  
</P>
<P>
 They were 1.5 seconds from doing it one more time until Messier stepped up. 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Center Pat Conacher tried a different career -- at least for one night. 
Conacher suffered a rib injury on Tuesday night against Winnipeg and could not 
play against the Rangers on Thursday. As it turned out, Conacher was a 
last-minute replacement for Kings' radio color commentator Brian Engblom, who 
worked the game for ESPN 2. Conacher, who has nine goals in 42 games, said the 
ribs were still very sore. . . . The other scratches were defenseman Brent 
Thompson and forwards Phil Crowe and Dave Taylor. Taylor has not played a 
regular-season game since Jan. 4 when he suffered a concussion. He has been out 
for nine consecutive games.

TENNIS / AUSTRALIAN OPEN; MARTIN, SAMPRAS WILL PLAY ALL-AMERICAN FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Martin undermined Stefan Edberg's serve-and-volley game today, winning 
three tiebreakers to set up an all-American final at the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, seeded ninth and playing in his first Grand Slam semifinal, defeated 
the fourth-seeded Swede, 3-6, 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-4) in 3 hours 50 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the All-American championship match, Martin will face top-seeded Pete 
Sampras, who defeated third-seeded and two-time defending champion Jim Courier, 
6-3, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg, whose right knee was treated early in the match, was overwhelmed at 
times by the power of Martin's backhand returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today I think I believed in myself a little bit more and I did what I had to 
do," said Martin, whose best previous Grand Slam performance was the 
quarterfinals at last summer's Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin missed several passing shots by inches in the first set, when Edberg 
used lobs to strand the American at the net. 
</P>
<P>
 But those passing shots began hitting during the second set. Martin led the 
second set, 5-3, but lost three consecutive games before capturing the 12th 
game and the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg saved three set points in the third-set tiebreaker, including one easy 
putaway at the net that Martin slammed way long. But Martin prevailed on his 
fourth set point, passing Edberg with a forehand shot and punching the air in 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin also won the fourth set in a tiebreaker, though it took four match 
points to finish off Edberg. On the final point, he slammed an ace down the 
middle, then hit a ball high into the stands and raised his arms in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, the 23-year-old from Lansing, Mich., never varied from his 
mild-mannered ways. He apologized after almost hitting a ballboy with a shot, 
and lifted his finger to his mouth to quiet a spectator who yelled happily 
after an Edberg double-fault. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Gabriela Sabatini stood helplessly at the back of the court as 
drop shots landed just on her side of the net. She lunged in vain for angled 
cross-court shots that skipped by her for winners. 
</P>
<P>
 But the final indignity for Sabatini in her semifinal loss to Aranxta Sanchez 
Vicario came late in the match when she turned her back to the net after 
hitting a ball out. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario, not sure if the ball was going to be out, reached for it and 
lifted a lob that hit the frustrated Sabatini in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 It took slightly more than a total of two hours for second-seeded Sanchez 
Vicario and top-seeded Steffi Graf to win semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, seeking her fourth Australian Open title in seven years, overpowered 
Kimiko Date, 6-3, 6-3, then Sanchez Vicario defeated Sabatini, 6-1, 6-2.

NHL ROUNDUP; SHEPPARD'S OVERTIME GOAL LIFTS RED WINGS, 4-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ray Sheppard scored 51 seconds into overtime Thursday night to give the 
Detroit Red Wings a 4-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Wings, 5-0 losers to the Blackhawks and Ed Belfour at Detroit on 
Tuesday night, got the game-winner when Keith Primeau fed Sheppard and the Red 
Wing forward beat Belfour with a shot from in front. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a case of getting a tremendous pass from Keith," Sheppard said of his 
winning goal. "Eddie (Belfour) was kind of leaning to his left, and I just 
lifted the puck up and it made it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Wings set a club record with their sixth consecutive road victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit had won five consecutive road games five previous times, the last from 
March 20-April 8, 1993. The Red Wings extended their unbeaten road string to 
nine, marking the first since 1970 they had as many consecutive road games 
without a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 7, Washington 2 -- Jim Schoenfeld came up a loser at Buffalo, N.Y., in 
his debut as coach of the Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenfeld replaced the fired Terry Murray only hours before the game, but the 
change didn't prevent the Capitals' fourth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa 1, Hartford 1 -- Ottawa's Scott Levins and Hartford's James Patrick 
scored power-play goals in the first period, then the Senators and Whalers 
played more than 45 scoreless minutes at Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa goaltender Craig Billington handled 29 shots, including a stop on 
Robert Kron midway through the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Reese of the Whalers stopped 27 shots in his ninth start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The tie left the Whalers winless in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 3, Quebec 0 -- Ken Wregget stopped 38 shots at Pittsburgh for his 
first shutout in nearly six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wregget, 29, has three shutouts in 374 NHL games. The other two came in 
1987-88, when he played for the Toronto Maple Leafs. The most recent was Feb. 
19, 1988, when he made 32 saves in a 5-0 victory over Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 3, Vancouver 2 -- Dave Gagner's goal 3:36 into overtime lifted the 
Stars at Vancouver.

TENNIS / AUSTRALIAN OPEN; IT'S EDBERG AGAINST THE AMERICANS IN FINAL FOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stefan Edberg believes he is playing some of the best tennis of his life as he 
sets out to loosen the American grip on the men's singles title at the 
Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-seeded Swede is outnumbered by the U.S. contingent of Pete Sampras, 
Jim Courier and Todd Martin in the semifinal lineup, but he feels his form is 
good enough to leave all his rivals empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling as good as I've done for quite some time now. I'm actually 
hitting the ball the best I've done for a year," said Edberg, who faces Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt pretty confident coming into this event and it's just a matter of 
keeping it rolling. If I'm playing the way I am, I know I have a good chance of 
doing well here." 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg, 28, has reached the final at Flinders Park in three of the last four 
years, only to lose each time. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier, who meets Sampras, has been an immovable obstruction in the final for 
the last two years, while luck has not always been on the stylish Swede's side. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve months ago, the torrid heat on Centre Court played into the hands of 
Courier, a competitor who prides himself on his physical durability. 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg had also been suffering from a back problem earlier in the tournament, 
while in 1990 he was forced to default in the final, handing Ivan Lendl his 
eighth and last Grand Slam title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have reached the semifinal or better almost every time I have been here, 
but I haven't won the last three finals," Edberg recalled after defeating 
Austria's Thomas Muster in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had probably my best chance in 1990 when I pulled a stomach muscle against 
Ivan. . . . I need a bit of luck here, yes.

 "As for last year, it was almost a joke to go out to play a final when it's 40 
degrees (Celsius, 104 Fahrenheit), especially on this court. It doesn't matter 
what your name is, playing under those conditions is really, really tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot easier under hot conditions to lose your brain. Anybody can go 
bananas out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for Edberg and his British coach, Tony Pickard, the hottest weather 
seems to have passed, leaving Martin with an unenviable task. 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg describes the ninth-seeded Martin, 23, as "a man for the future," but, 
more revealingly, suggests that Martin has "nothing that really scares me." 
</P>
<P>
 Courier and Sampras have played 10 times, with current world No. 1 Sampras 
winning eight matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Courier is unbeaten at Flinders Park since 1991, when he lost in the 
fourth round to Edberg, and the Australian Open is one of two Grand Slam titles 
that still elude the 22-year-old Sampras.

EWING HITS SHOT IN THE KNICK OF TIME; CLIPPERS: NINE-FOOT JUMPER WITH 0.9 
SECONDS LEFT UPSTAGES MANNING'S 39-POINT PERFORMANCE IN 103-101 LOSS BEFORE 
17,507 AT ANAHEIM ARENA.

 Homeless because of earthquake damage to the Sports Arena, the Clippers moved 
Thursday night's game against the New York Knicks to the Anaheim Arena, and 
Danny Manning played as if he likes the Anaheim Arena, getting 39 points and 12 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the New York Knicks' Patrick Ewing upstaged Manning, hitting a fadeaway, 
nine-foot jumper over Clipper center Elmore Spencer with 0.9 seconds remaining 
as the Knicks overcame a 13-point deficit to beat the Clippers, 103-101, before 
17,507 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went to his best shot, the turnaround fadeaway," Spencer said. "I put my 
hands up and jumped a little bit. But it's something he's done 1,000 times and 
this time I was the victim of it." 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied at 101-101 after Manning made a running jumper over Ewing 
with 23.6 seconds remaining, the Knicks called a timeout and ran the clock down 
before Ewing, who scored 32 points and had 16 rebounds, hit the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers called time to set up a play but Mark Aguirre missed a 
desperation over-the-shoulder lob from midcourt as time ran out. Coach Bob 
Weiss glared at Aguirre as they walked off the court because it wasn't the play 
that they wanted to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre declined comment, saying: "I'm not the one to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 After leading 78-67, the Clippers were outscored 16-5 at the end of the third 
quarter and the start of the fourth as the Knicks hit three three-point shots 
cut it to 85-83 on Derek Harper's three-point shot with 9:42 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Clipper Charles Smith made a three-point shot with .4 of a second left 
in the third quarter and Rolando Blackman opened the fourth quarter with a 
three-pointer for 81-78 Knick lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Manning kept the Clippers in the game, scoring their first 11 points in 
the fourth quarter as they took a 92-87 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Clippers leading by 89-85, Manning scored five consecutive points, 
making a fadeaway jumper and a free throw and a jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing answered with four points in a row, sinking a follow shot and tipping in 
a missed shot by Smith with 5:34 remaining to pull the Knicks to within one at 
92-91. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 94-91 after Clipper guard Ron Harper, who had 18 points, and Manning 
sank foul shots, the Knicks had a chance to pull to within one, but Spencer 
blocked a shot by Ewing with 3:38 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers' Mark Jackson missed a shot at the other end but the Knicks' John 
Starks fouled Clipper rookie Harold Ellis going for the rebound and Ellis made 
two free throws with 3:14 left for 96-91. 
</P>
<P>
 After Starks hit a three-pointer with 2:57 left, Manning answered with a hook 
for 98-94. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith hit a jumper with 1:28 remaining and Ewing tipped in a miss by Smith 
to cut it to 99-98. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers had a chance to seal it, but Smith blocked a jumper by Ellis with 
37.7 seconds remaining. The Knicks called time out to set up a play and Starks 
made a three-pointer in front of the Clipper bench to give the Knicks a 101-99 
lead with 33.9 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers called a timeout to set up a play, but there was little doubt 
that they'd set up a play for Manning, and he made an eight-foot running jumper 
in the key over Ewing to tie it with 23.6 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers haven't played at the Sports Arena since Jan. 8. After ending a 
six-game, 10-day East Coast trip last Thursday, the Clippers were forced to 
play move last Friday's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Forum while 
the Sports Arena is being repaired. . . . The Clippers hope to play Saturday 
night's game against the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Sports Arena, which is 
undergoing earthquake-related repairs. "We expect some sort of official 
notification (today), but we're very hopefully that we will be back in there 
Saturday," Clipper spokesman Joe Safety said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Clipper Charles Smith, who signed with the Knicks last season, thinks 
he left at the right time. "I got out at the perfect time," Smith said. "When I 
told them that I wanted to leave I knew that it was the right thing to do. I 
weighed the situation. I wouldn't want to be here." Is Smith surprised that the 
Clippers have deteriorated after making the playoffs the last two seasons? "No, 
I'm not surprised," Smith said. "I knew it was coming. They knew it was 
coming."

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: ANOTHER SUPER ROUT WOULD BE ANOTHER TURN-OFF FOR NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's back by unpopular demand -- same time, same station, same teams. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, which televised Buffalo-Dallas I, also gets Buffalo-Dallas II. 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably not what NBC had in mind last April when it bid $41 million for 
Super Bowl XXVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four-year television contract that expires this season, the Super Bowl 
rotation was ABC, CBS and NBC for XXV, XXVI and XXVII, with XXVIII left open 
for bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL, which never misses an opportunity to pick up an extra $40 million or 
so wherever it can, came up with that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC was the winner -- or loser, depending on how things go Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Play-by-play announcer Dick Enberg calls this game the most important for one 
team -- in this case the Bills -- in the history of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Bills lose, they will be a four-time loser and will always be equated 
with losing," he said. "If they win, they will undo all that and be given 
credit for a great accomplishment -- going to four straight Super Bowls and 
winning the fourth." 
</P>
<P>
 Enberg is hoping for a close game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a good game, the ratings for the second half will go through the 
roof," he said. "We're all hungry for a climactic finish. What would be perfect 
would be a Super Bowl overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enberg, a former San Fernando Valley resident, said that at one time he lived 
in the Northridge Meadows apartment complex, where 16 people died in the Jan. 
17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be Enberg's sixth Super Bowl as the play-by-play announcer, and his 
second with Bob Trumpy as his analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpy, asked if he was going to renegotiate his contract now that analyst 
John Madden got $32 million over four years from Fox, said, "I mentioned that 
to Dick Ebersol (the president of NBC sports) and he said something about Toys 
R Us certificates." 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpy's annual salary is about the same as the $325,000 per game Madden will 
make at Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NBC could have saved a lot of money by simply rerunning last year's pregame 
show. But it has come up with a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 One difference will be the host. It was Bob Costas last year; this year it 
will be Jim Lampley. The cast includes Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the features will be a look back 25 years ago at Super Bowl III, in 
which Joe Namath guaranteed a New York Jet victory over the Baltimore Colts -- 
and delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Costas, on "The Tonight Show" with Jay Leno on Wednesday night, was asked why 
he was already at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pregame show is set to start in about an hour," Costas said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Bowl is always the most-watched sporting event each year, with the 
pregame show often placing second. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, the pregame show has some competition -- particularly in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC has UCLA-California basketball at 1 p.m., the same time the Super Bowl 
pregame show starts on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, the Bruins' victory over Arizona State on Channel 5 got a solid 
5.3 rating. Last February, a UCLA-Oregon game on Channel 7 got an 0.9 rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing like an unbeaten record and a No. 1 ranking to improve ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add basketball: It's a shame UCLA's game against Stanford on Thursday night 
was delayed by Prime Ticket because of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, USC-Cal was live on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Long Beach State was on live television. Channel 56 carried the 49ers' 
game against UC Irvine. It was the second of six Long Beach games the Orange 
County station will carry, all at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State was willing to change starting times for $3,000. The school 
figured it needs the exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What would Super Bowl Sunday be without Charles Barkley? 
</P>
<P>
 A special edition of "Inside Stuff" will follow the 9:30 a.m. Phoenix-Boston 
NBA game on NBC Sunday, and the whole show, entitled "Sir Charles," will focus 
on Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
 During a conference call with television sports columnists this week, Barkley, 
currently sidelined because of knee and back problems, said he might retire 
after the season because his body is telling him to. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if broadcasting was in his future, he said, "No, I don't think so. I've 
never had to work for a living, never had a job. I'm good at doing nothing. I 
don't think I want to change that. I'm interested in acting, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he announced his political aspirations for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd also like to run for governor of Alabama in 1998," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley said he wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the Super Bowl-related shows, the best one is always NFL Films' "Road 
to the Super Bowl." This year it will be on Channel 4 Saturday at 7 p.m. 
Although Steve Sabol and crew had only a week to put the finishing touches on 
this one, it still figures to be a winner. . . . So does TNT's "Super Bowl 
Saturday Night," which will be televised Saturday at 5 p.m. Among those 
appearing on this show is comedian Jeff Foxworthy, a name that could also apply 
to John Madden and Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox ballyhooed a news conference that was held in Atlanta on Thursday. It was 
announced that Pat Summerall and Terry Bradshaw had been hired, along with 
executive producer Ed Goren. Someone should tell Fox there's nothing as stale 
as yesterday's news. . . . With the departure of Bradshaw and others, CBS has 
scrapped plans to continue "NFL Today." 
</P>
<P>
 On the next edition of "Front Page," Fox's prime-time news magazine show on 
Tuesdays at 9 p.m., there will be never-before-seen footage of Babe Ruth's 
"called shot" during the 1932 World Series. The footage was acquired from the 
great-grandson of a spectator at the game. KMPC's Jim Healy, who as a young 
reporter was covering a news conference at the Ambassador Hotel for the 
Hollywood Citizen News in 1947, asked Ruth if he had indeed called the home run 
he hit on the next pitch. Ruth told Healy he was simply shaking his arms in 
anger at the Chicago Cubs' dugout. Someone in the Cubs' dugout had rolled a 
lemon out at Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if Howie Long ends up at Fox. . . . Long went on with Doug 
Krikorian and Brian Golden of KMPC to announce his retirement Thursday before 
his news conference. . . . On Tuesday, Long had been on with Joe McDonnell, a 
critic of Long's. McDonnell was nice to Long when he was on the air, but soon 
went back to ripping him. . . . Two weeks ago from Buffalo, XTRA's Rick 
Schwartz predicted that Long would retire. And Wednesday night, Schwartz 
speculated that much of the Raider coaching staff would soon be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC offers coverage of Senior Skins golf this weekend from the Mauna Lani 
Resort on the big island of Hawaii. Vin Scully was scheduled to work the 
telecasts, but because of his son Michael's death in a helicopter crash last 
Thursday, Brent Musburger will replace him. . . . CBS announced it will 
televise Nancy Kerrigan skating in an exhibition at Boston's Northeastern 
University in prime time on Saturday, Feb. 5. The show will be taped Feb. 4.  
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of sports programming on television this weekend, but Mac 
Lipscomb, the new executive producer of Showtime Entertainment Television, 
still believes the multi-fight, pay-per-view card at the new MGM Grand Hotel in 
Las Vegas Saturday night will do well. "Despite the (Pernell) Whitaker fight, 
Julio Cesar Chavez is still a national draw," he said.

NBA ROUNDUP; CAVALIERS END BULLS' STREAK AT 7

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerald Wilkins had two options: Get stitched up in a hurry and risk his good 
looks, or spend a few extra minutes in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins ended up spending more time with the doctor than he wanted, but he 
came back to score five consecutive points during an 18-2 fourth-quarter run 
that helped the Cleveland Cavaliers defeat the Chicago Bulls, 100-84, Thursday 
night at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins was cut above the right eye when he set a pick on Horace Grant with a 
few seconds remaining in the first half. Wilkins, who caught an elbow, spent a 
couple minutes on the floor before being helped to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't return until late in the third quarter, and the Cavaliers let most 
of a 13-point halftime lead get away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just happy to get back out on the floor," Wilkins said. "I kept telling 
the doctor, 'Come on, come on.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'If I rush, you'll have a real ugly eye.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls, whose seven-game winning streak ended, remained a game ahead of 
their pace at this time last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers have won seven of nine to get to .500. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Price had 21 points and 14 assists for the Cavaliers, and Wilkins scored 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen led the Bulls with a season-high 31, although none came in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 98, Dallas 95 -- Tom Gugliotta scored 23 points at Landover, Md., 
to help the Bullets hand the Mavericks their 16th consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 94-93, the Mavericks forced a turnover and had a chance to take the 
lead. But Jamal Mashburn missed a layup, got the loose ball and then bounced a 
three-point shot off the rim with 10 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 102, New Jersey 92 -- Gary Payton scored 21 points and Ricky Pierce 
and Sam Perkins each had 20 at Seattle to help the SuperSonics end a 
season-high three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Anderson scored 20 points and Benoit Benjamin 18 for the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 113, Indiana 106 -- Rookie reserve forward Rodney Rogers scored 25 
points and had nine rebounds and four steals -- all career highs -- to lead the 
Nuggets at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers' three-point basket from the right corner with 1:23 to play put the 
Nuggets ahead for good, 104-103, after the Pacers scored eight consecutive 
points to take their only lead of the second half and erase a 15-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 113, Sacramento 97 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored 24 points at Houston to 
help the Rockets extend the Kings' losing streak to six games.

 Penn State held No. 7 Purdue scoreless for the final 3:35 Thursday night to 
take a 71-68 Big Ten victory at State College, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, said Purdue Coach Gene Keady, "was lost in the first five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was lost at both ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State hit five of its first seven shots while taking a 14-2 lead. The 
Boilermakers had six turnovers in the game's first 4 1/2 minutes. Still, they

</P>
<P>
 Purdue, 14-2 overall and 4-2 in the Big Ten, missed its last six shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boilermakers were the highest-ranked opponents Penn State (9-6, 2-4) has 
beaten since February of 1974, when the Lions upset No. 7 Pittsburgh.

 Cincinnati 76, No. 8 Massachusetts 74 -- LaZelle Durden scored 16 points in 
the final six minutes at Cincinnati, which blew a 22-point lead before

 Dontonio Wingfield, returning from a one-game suspension for missing class, 
scored five points and took three charges as Cincinnati (13-5) opened a huge 
first-half lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts (15-3) caught up with 10 minutes to play, but Wingfield stopped 
the comeback with a three-pointer. Durden led the Bearcats with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 Louisville 74, Virginia Tech 63 -- DeJuan Wheat scored 20 points to 
lead the Cardinals in a Metro Conference game at Blacksburg, Va. Louisville 
(15-2, 5-1) is off to its best start since 1982-83. Greg Minor and Clifford 
Rozier each added 17 points for Louisville, which shot 54% from the field 
compared to 39% for the Hokies (13-3, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 25 New Mexico State 60, San Jose State 59 -- Keith Johnson hit two free 
throws with 10 seconds to play in a Big West game at San Jose. San Jose State 
(8-8, 4-4) made an 11-5 run to cut the deficit to 56-54 with 2:32 to play and 
the Aggies (15-1, 7-0) hung on. OTHER GAMES

TITANS WIN IT WITH SOMETHING TO SPARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here was something new: Just before tipoff on Thursday night, Cal State 
Fullerton Coach Brad Holland saw not five, not six, not seven, but eight Titans 
suited up in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt buoyed by such a large contingent, the Titans went out and surprised 
UC Santa Barbara, 66-57, in front of a Thunderdome crowd of 4,014. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the last two weeks, thanks to injuries and illness, Fullerton, 
4-12 overall and 2-6 in the Big West, has been forced to practice with only 
four or five players. Against Pacific last week, the Titans had seven players 
-- and only six were sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Practices have been, well, how would you describe them? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, I wasn't at practice all week," said guard Greg Vernon, who 
came back from flu to score 10 points. "When I was in there on Wednesday, the 
guys were going hard playing two on two." 
</P>
<P>
 Two on two? 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Josh King, still recovering from oral surgery for impacted wisdom 
teeth, didn't make the trip to Santa Barbara. Darren Little returned after 
missing several practices and last week's Pacific game with flu. 
</P>
<P>
 But the person who made the most dramatic comeback conquered an ailment other 
than physical. Guard James French, zero for his last 15 three-point attempts 
entering the game, scored a career-high 22 points for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
 French, who led the Big West in three-point percentage in December but had 
gone the last three games without a three-point basket, sank five of six 
three-pointers against the Gauchos (7-11, 3-5), including three of four to help 
put the game away in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just feeling good," French said. "I was feeling loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton shot 53% as a team on Thursday -- only the third time this season 
that the Titans were better than 50%.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / PACIFIC 10 ROUNDUP; STOUDAMIRE LIFTS ARIZONA OVER OREGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Damon Stoudamire said that all he did to break out of a two-game scoring slump 
was return to basics. 
</P>
<P>
 It paid off in a 27-point performance Thursday night, helping 13th-ranked 
Arizona defeat Oregon, 98-86, at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire came in with a 17.6-point average but had scored only nine points 
against UCLA and four against USC last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked hard, played hard and stuck around after practice," he said. He took 
extra shots and concentrated on "doing the basics to get back to the way I 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 He scored 18 first-half points, including three three-point baskets, but after 
making two more three-point shots in the first 3:29 of the second period, 
Stoudamire went scoreless for 14:22. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, 15-3 overall and 4-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference, made 26 of 38 free 
throws; Oregon (6-9, 2-4) made nine of 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State 88, Oregon State 82 -- Stevin Smith scored a career-high 39 
points and tied his own Pac-10 record by making 10 three-point shots to lead 
the Sun Devils (9-6, 4-2) at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State made 76.9% of its shots in the first half as Smith made seven of 
eight three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Anderson led Oregon State (5-10, 1-5) with 24 points.

KIDD DOESN'T GIVE TROJANS A CHANCE; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CAL GUARD PLAYS THE 
WHOLE GAME AND KEEPS BEARS IN CONTROL AGAINST USC, 77-68. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The best hope USC had for a victory over California Thursday night was to 
catch the Bears looking ahead to their showdown with No. 1 UCLA on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a wish that could have came true -- if California didn't have point 
guard Jason Kidd running the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Kidd's 16 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds in 40 minutes, the 
Bears had enough to defeat a stubborn USC team, 77-68, before 14,500 at the 
Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just never know what he's going to do," USC guard Brandon Martin said. 
"You don't know if he's going to pass, dribble or shoot. He just killed us in 
the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kidd, a 6-foot-4 sophomore, who spearheaded a 21-9 run late in the 
first half that broke open a tight game and sent California to a 46-34 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Bears' 17 first-half baskets, 11 were either layups or dunks, as Kidd 
had seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this conference since the 1970s and I've never seen a guard that 
I had greater respect for than Jason Kidd," USC Coach George Raveling said. "He 
is just a dominant player on the floor who can control the pace of the game and 
get the ball to the right people under the right circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 USC made a run to start the second half behind seven points by Lorenzo Orr, 
who finished with 13 points and six rebounds, to close within six points. Kidd, 
however, answered with six points of his own to give California a 60-45 lead 
with nine minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who was not expected to play because of stomach problems, sparked a 
late USC rally with 17 of his career-high 24 points in the second half. He made 
four of six three-pointers and helped pull the Trojans within 69-63 with four 
minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's comeback proved to be too late, as California held on. Lamond Murray 
scored five of his 21 points to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that Brandon showed his character tonight because he hadn't been 
able to practice all week," Raveling said. "He showed his mental toughness and 
I think that we should have gotten the ball to him more." 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which has lost four consecutive games, is 10-6 overall and 3-4 in Pacific 
10 Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to stick together through rough times like this," Orr said. "I 
know that we'll win some games. We just can't get down on ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 California (11-4, 4-2) moves on to play UCLA and will probably have to do so 
without starters Alfred Grisby (hamstring) and Anwar McQueen (foot), neither of 
whom played against the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that we have a choice to see if we're ready to play UCLA or 
not," California Coach Todd Bozeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think we're ready to play with anybody. It doesn't matter to us whether 
UCLA was ranked No. 1 or No. 20." 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Burt Harris started at point guard but got in foul trouble and did not score 
in 13 minutes of play. Damaine Powell, Harris' backup, had eight assists but 
also did not score in 27 minutes. Senior Mark Boyd scored 14 points and grabbed 
five rebounds. . . . USC will play at Stanford Saturday.

EMPIRE LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL; NO. 3 CYPRESS HANDLES SECOND-PLACE KATELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Third-ranked Cypress strengthened its grip on the Empire League girls' 
basketball race Thursday, beating second-place Katella, 82-60, at Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (20-2, 6-0 in league), which now has a two-game lead, had a difficult 
time with Katella (10-6, 4-2) the first time they met, beating the Knights, 
62-56, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions had no such trouble Thursday, taking a quick 6-0 lead on the 
way to a 44-25 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shot a lot better this time," Cypress Coach John Selbe said. "They shot 
real well, too, but we were just able to get the second chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress outscored Katella, 28-14, in the second quarter, with Julie Adams' 12 
points and Jessica Eggleston's nine leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, the Centurions dominated the boards and kept the game out 
of reach. Eggleston finished with 31 points and nine rebounds and Adams 27 
points and 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect that, and need that from them," Selbe said. "It seemed like there 
were times when we would just be getting the rebounds and really running the 
ball up the floor well, and that's what we need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The closest Katella got in the second half came after an 8-0 run, which cut 
Cypress' lead to 58-44. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Flaming, who finished with 15 points and 12 assists, provided Cypress 
with some outside scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Vargas had 15 points and eight rebounds for Katella. Khaliah Fountaine 
had 12 points and Cris Carrillo finished with 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel confident know," Selbe said. "If we lose this game we're tied for 
first and things get tight. So, this was a big game for us." 
</P>
<P>
 In another league game: 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza 59, Loara 40 -- Kristy Kierulff had 17 points and Jeanine Cherney 
added 10 points for visiting Esperanza (12-8, 3-3). 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado 50, Los Alamitos 33 -- Shanna Renken had 15 points for visiting El 
Dorado (14-6, 4-2), which is tied for second with Katella. El Dorado outscored 
Los Alamitos, 17-11, in the second quarter.

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; PACIFICA RACES PAST BOLSA GRANDE, 84-72 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacifica Coach Bob Becker's up-tempo style must be growing on Garden Grove 
League fans because a packed gymnasium watched the host Mariners run and gun 
past Bolsa Grande, 84-72, Thursday at Pacifica High. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica (18-1, 9-0 in league), ranked seventh in the county, used its 
pressure defense to force 20 turnovers, and Chris Vlasic scored 22 of his 27 
points in the second half to help the Mariners hold off the stubborn Matadors 
(9-10, 5-4). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they just ran out of gas," Becker said. "We've been playing nine and 
10 guys all year and I think we wore them down. We had a little more left in 
the tank." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pacifica opened the second quarter scoring seven points in 25 
seconds, then started the third quarter with a 12-2 run, the Mariners were 
never safely ahead until Ramon Alliman, who had 13 points, came up with a steal 
followed by a two-handed dunk, which brought the crowd to its feet and gave 
Pacifica a 78-63 lead with five minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Baughman had 18 points and 14 rebounds and Tuan Pham had 18 points, 
including four three-pointers, to keep the Matadors close. Bolsa Grande 
trailed, 42-40, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told our kids at halftime, 'We're close, but we are not where we want to 
be,' " Bolsa Grande Coach Tom Cardoza said. "We wanted a game in the 60s. But 
they have some outstanding athletes, they're strong inside, they can shoot 
three-pointers . . . you can't defend everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Grande had problems with Vlasic, who scored Pacifica's first 10 points 
of the third quarter in a two-minute span, giving Pacifica a 52-42 lead with 5 
minutes 45 seconds remaining in the quarter. Vlasic made three of his four 
three-pointers in the third quarter, and made nine of 10 shots in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pacifica jumped to a 12-point lead to start the third quarter, the 
Matadors battled back and after a three-pointer by Pham and a pair of layups by 
Baughman, Bolsa Grande cut the lead to 65-58 after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Stewart and Cuong Doan each scored 11 points for Bolsa Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Surface and Erik Maurer each scored 10 points and Ryan Teague had three 
three-pointers for Pacifica. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

PREP WRESTLING ROUNDUP; BUENA PARK HEAVYWEIGHT'S VICTORY WINS DUAL MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lights. The roar of the crowd. The smiles and stream of handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The end justified everything else that transpired Thursday night at Buena 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 With one side shouting "Wa-li, Wa-li," and other countering with "Gie-sen, 
Gie-sen," at ear-shattering decibels during the heavyweight match between Wali 
Sibrie and Glenn Giesen, the Freeway League showdown between ninth-ranked Sunny 
Hills and No. 10 Buena Park didn't disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills trailed going into the final weight class and needed a pin from 
Giesen to win the key dual meet between rivals that have long dominated the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 Sibrie demonstrated flashes of why he's the second-ranked heavyweight in the 
state with a second-period pin that gave the Coyotes a 34-24 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have the No. 2 wrestler in the state going out to wrestle last, you 
feel pretty good about your chances," Buena Park Coach Rick Zabala said. "All 
he had to do was win. We thought we'd be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a feeling the Coyotes could enjoy all night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills (15-1, 3-1) jumped to a 12-4 lead after three weight classes, 
courtesy of a pin by the Lancers' Robert Andres at 103 pounds and a forfeit at 
119 by Buena Park (14-2, 4-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park took its first lead after Vince Virgen (135) pinned Dean Roman at 2 
minutes 35 seconds for a 16-12 lead, which it extended to 19-12 after a 6-2 
decision by Shawn Pena at 140. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers pulled to 19-18 when Justin Tetley pinned Ricky Otiz at 145, but 
consecutive decisions by Mario Rojas (152), Ben Parra (160) and Shawn Burch 
(171) put Buena Park back in command, 28-18, with two classes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills' Darren Beard pinned Jason Mosgrove early at 189 to put the 
Lancers within four points, until Sibrie went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Sunny Hills defeated Buena Park in the season-ending league meet to 
share the title, but it was the third year in a row the Lancers have lost a 
dual meet to the Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rick does a good job of coaching," Sunny Hills Coach Curt Mellem said. "But 
we didn't wrestle well. . . . I have no idea why." KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

GIRLS' SOCCER ROUNDUP; BRACKETT'S GOAL HELPS COSTA MESA TIE ESTANCIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's Heather Brackett scored on a corner kick with 22 minutes 
remaining to give the Mustangs a 1-1 tie with Estancia in a Pacific Coast 
League girls' soccer game Thursday at Costa Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
 Brackett's goal came when Estancia goalkeeper Beth Ferryman drifted into the 
goal after making an over-the-shoulder catch on the corner kick. 
</P>
<P>
 On the play, Ferryman thought the ball went out of bounds in the air before 
re-entering the field of play, but Brackett said the ball did the opposite, 
curving toward the goal causing Ferryman's momentum to carry her past the goal 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a disappointing way to have a game decided," Ferryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The game would not have been as close if it hadn't been for Mustang goalkeeper 
Sara Ackelson, who made 16 saves, many on uncontested shots from close range. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending league champion Eagles (9-5-4, 3-1-2) scored when Whitney 
Gilliam took a corner kick from Tracie Manz and scored her first goal of the 
season 15 minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the game, Costa Mesa (7-2-5, 2-1-3) was backpedaling in its 
defensive zone as Estancia used an effective passing game to keep pressure on 
Ackelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole season has consisted of playing solid defense and counterpunching," 
Costa Mesa Coach Dan Johnston said. "Last season we lost a lot of games, 1-0, 
but this season our counterattack and good goalkeeping have kept us in every 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this is our first winning season in the four years we've had a program."

SANTA ANITA; BIEN BIEN STARTS 1994 WITHOUT RIVAL KOTASHAAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Paco Gonzalez doesn't have to beat the drums for Bien Bien. He has 
Richard Mandella to do it for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just think what Bien Bien would have done if it hadn't been for my horse," 
Mandella said. "It took everything Kotashaan had to beat Bien Bien in those 
races. Take Kotashaan out of those races and Bien Bien's almost got the record 
that my horse had." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandella-trained Kotashaan, en route to the Eclipse Award's male turf title 
and a certain horse-of-the-year championship that will be announced in New 
Orleans next Friday night, won three of his six races in 1993 by beating Bien 
Bien in hard-fought battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Their rivalry began inauspiciously at Santa Anita last winter, when Kotashaan 
finished second and Bien Bien was fourth in the San Marcos Handicap. After 
that, Kotashaan and Bien Bien ran 1-2 every time they met. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Kotashaan won the San Luis Rey Stakes by 1 1/4 lengths. In April, 
Kotashaan needed every inch of the San Juan Capistrano Handicap's approximately 
1 3/4-mile distance to beat Bien Bien by a nose, and Mandella's horse was a 
half-length better in November at Santa Anita in the Breeders' Cup Turf Stakes. 
Two of those races were at equal weights, and the purse difference between 
first and second place in all three was more than $875,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bien Bien was a terrible horse to have to hook," said Kent Desormeaux, who 
rode Kotashaan to those victories. "He would just refuse to let you by. In the 
Breeders' Cup, we got up to (Chris) McCarron's elbow, and there was Bien Bien 
again, holding us off. Those two horse eyeballed each other all year long." 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, it didn't look as though Bien Bien had much of a year: only two 
victories in seven starts. The rub was that the 5-year-old son of Manila had 
the misfortune to be peaking at a time when he was surrounded by grass 
standouts. When Kotashaan wasn't beating him, Star Of Cozzene was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of another year when we've had so much depth in the turf 
division," Mandella said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is how tough that division was: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lure, winner of the Breeders' Cup Mile for the second consecutive year, 
didn't even win an Eclipse Award. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Star Of Cozzene, who beat Kotashaan and Lure twice each, finished a distant 
third in the Eclipse voting. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fraise, the winner of the Breeders' Cup Turf in 1992, was a 14-1 longshot 
when he finished fourth in the 1993 running. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Flawlessly, the female turf champion for the last two years with seven 
victories in 10 tries, ran ninth in the Breeders' Cup Mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotashaan will become the first grass horse to win the national title since 
John Henry in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotashaan has been sold, retired and sent to Japan to begin a breeding career. 
Of the four turf stars that remain, Bien Bien will be the first out of the gate 
in 1994, having been entered for Saturday's $125,000 San Marcos Handicap at 
Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez is keeping his eye on the weather, however, because Bien Bien doesn't 
like soft going. The San Marcos was run on a soggy turf last year, when Star Of 
Cozzene beat Kotashaan by a length and Bien Bien finished fourth. Bien Bien's 
worst race of the year, in the Man o' War Stakes that Star Of Cozzene won in 
September, was run in a bog at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bien Bien's first start in almost three months, he has drawn the outside 
post in a seven-horse field that also includes Square Cut, Robber Ramble, 
Navire, Explosive Red, Fanatic Boy and Myrakalu. 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien is the high weight at 122 pounds. Explosive Red, next in the weights 
at 116 pounds, shipped to California from Canada and won the Hollywood Derby in 
November, then finished third, 6 1/2 lengths behind Fraise, in the Hollywood 
Turf Cup. Square Cut and Robber Ramble will run as an entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron, who has ridden Bien Bien in his last 14 races and in all six 
of his victories, is sitting out a five-day stewards' suspension, so Laffit 
Pincay will take over for the San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez and Bien Bien's owners, Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan, who bought 
him at a yearling auction for $100,000, ran the horse on dirt early in his 
career, without much success. With Bien Bien's breeding -- Manila was the male 
turf champion in 1986 -- a future on grass was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Lure, another slow starter on dirt, also has grass bloodlines, but trainer 
Shug McGaughey said that had little to do with the switch of surfaces. An 
honest man, McGaughey said that he moved him to the turf just because he 
couldn't think of anything else to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborating on a published report that several investigators were closely 
watching a horse scheduled to run in last November's Breeders' Cup, Santa Anita 
security director Dick Smith said, "Two sources, one from the Thoroughbred 
Racing Protective Bureau's task force, the other locally, had told us that 
somebody might try to get to the horse with drugs. The owners of the horse had 
no knowledge of anything going on. Then, a few days before entry time, the 
owners decided not to enter the horse, for a perfectly legitimate reason, 
something not related to our investigation. When the horse wasn't running, the 
danger faded away. But before that, we still thought that our sources had been 
onto something. We were all relieved when the horse didn't run." Smith declined 
to identify the horse.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: ONE-WAY FLIGHT TO ROUND TRIP IN A DETROIT MINUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It didn't take Rashad Haughton and his family long to realize maybe Los 
Angeles wasn't such a great place to be after all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haughton family was moving from Detroit, and Rashad, a 6-foot-2 junior, 
was to enroll at Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haughtons landed in Los Angeles around 12:30 a.m. last Monday. About four 
hours later. . . . Well, we all know what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial quake was not enough to dissuade the Haughtons. They stayed 
through the week, but their desire to remain lessened with each aftershock. The 
series of jolts within 21 minutes Friday was the last straw. 
</P>
<P>
 They were on a flight back to Detroit the next day. NORTHWEST VALLEY 
CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Roll Continues 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kennedy football Coach Bob Francola, tailback Donte Scarbrough 
was acutely aware of the success of his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarbrough wanted more of the same. In fact, he intentionally chose the same 
uniform number as former Golden Cougar running back Ontiwaun Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Scarbrough got his wish. He accepted a scholarship offer from San 
Jose State and became the third Kennedy tailback to land an NCAA Division I 
scholarship since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 He follows 1990s standouts Carter (Arizona) and Elijah Raphael (Washington 
State). Since Carter started as a sophomore in 1988, Kennedy has ranked among 
the region's most consistent rushing teams. In fact, Kennedy's starting 
tailbacks have racked up 8,345 yards and 95 touchdowns since 1988 -- an average 
of nearly 1,400 yards and 16 touchdowns on the ground per season. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Carter, other scholarship winners included 1984 graduate Michael 
Pringle (Cal State Fullerton), 1986 graduate Edwin Jones (Iowa State) and 1987 
graduate Ron Hardy (Oregon). Pringle was a third-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Scorecard: Six scholarships for Kennedy tailbacks in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of the young kids in the neighborhood know that if they play 
here, (the tailback) is going to get the ball 240 times a season," said 
Francola, who took over in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The heir-apparent to the aforementioned trio could be Antwane Smith, a speedy 
sophomore who started at receiver last fall. Smith rushed for 251 yards and 
three touchdowns in 24 carries, most of which were reverses and inside handoffs 
from the wing position. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the real deal too," Francola said. MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Tough Opposition 
</P>
<P>
 Few opponents got the best of Royal's Rommel Butler on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
 The All-Southern Section cornerback often dominated the competition during his 
three years as a starter for the Highlanders. Butler always battled the 
opposition's best receiver one on one. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Butler, however, he has encountered another powerful foe -- 
the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 In two previous attempts, Butler failed to earn the NCAA-required 700. Butler, 
a member of The Times' All-Ventura County team the last two seasons, has been 
offered a scholarship to USC, providing he earns a qualifying score. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler took the test again Saturday but will not receive his score for at 
least two weeks. The NCAA national letter of intent signing period begins Feb. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Butler did score 700 during his latest attempt, sources said that USC 
might not hold a scholarship for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler is understandably troubled by the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't pick up my score that much from the first time," he said. "Even 
though I took it again, it doesn't really look good." 
</P>
<P>
 If Butler does not receive a scholarship to USC, he said, he will probably 
attend Moorpark College this fall. Around the Leagues. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Good things are happening in pairs at Palmdale. Last week, quarterback 
Rocque Sandoval and receiver Tony Coleman committed to play football at New 
Mexico. Last season, quarterback Terrence Zenno and receiver Al Corney, 1993 
Palmdale graduates, both played as freshman at Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
 * Agoura senior Chad Payne has won 20 consecutive matches at 125 pounds for 
the Charger wrestling team. Payne is 24-1 this season and won the Newbury Park, 
Quartz Hill and Alemany tournaments. Payne's only loss came in the Schurr 
tournament in the second week. 
</P>
<P>
 * When Oak Park soccer player Cheryl Klein scored in the Eagles' 5-1 loss to 
La Reina on Wednesday, it snapped a 27-match streak during which the Regents 
had not given up a goal in Tri-Valley League play.

CRESPI FALLS SHORT OF HARVARD, 55-54 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emotion is nice, but height is better. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi High dedicated the game to former Coach Paul Muff, who died last week, 
but Harvard-Westlake countered with 6-foot-7 twins Jason and Jarron Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Collins brothers dominated inside, shooting over Crespi's shorter players, 
and Harvard held on for a 55-54 Mission League victory Thursday night at 
Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are tough on the blocks," Crespi Coach Pat Yerina said. "They can just 
shoot over us. Brett Nordyke played great defense, but you can't stop 6-7 if 
you are 6-3." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the size disadvantage, the Celts had a shot to win, but Gianandrea 
Marcaccini's three-pointer bounced off the back of the rim at the final buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 What kept Crespi in the game was that Harvard could do nothing from the 
outside to complement its inside game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines did not make a basket from outside the paint until Ben Robbins' 
12-foot jumper with 3 minutes 20 seconds to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank goodness we've got two big men," said Harvard senior guard Scott 
Garson, one of the team's best long-range shooters. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Collins led the Wolverines (17-1, 7-1 in league play) with 22 points and 
four blocked shots. Jarron scored 14 points and blocked three shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason and Jarron played great," Garson said. "Even when we were missing, they 
put in the offensive rebounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Lubaszka led Crespi (7-10, 3-4) with 17 points. Nordyke added 16 and 
Marcaccini scored 14, including 10 in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard dominated inside early -- 10 of its 11 baskets in the first quarter 
were layups or dunks. The other was a five-foot jumper by Jason Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celts were pesky. Although they never led in the first half, they tied the 
score four times. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a great job," Garson said. "We didn't know what to expect from them. 
They played really inspired." 
</P>
<P>
 Lubaszka keyed a strong second quarter by hitting three consecutive 
three-pointers. He also had a steal and a layup with four seconds to play to 
tie the score, 26-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard took a 53-48 lead with two minutes to play on a three-point play by 
Jarron Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by one, Crespi took the ball out of bounds with four seconds left, 
setting up a 20-foot shot at the top of the key for Marcaccini.

TITANS SURPRISE UC SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here was something new: Just before tip-off Thursday night, Cal State 
Fullerton Coach Brad Holland saw not five, not six, not seven, but eight Titans 
suited up in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt buoyed by such a large contingent, the Titans went right out and 
surprised UC Santa Barbara, 66-57, in front of 4,014 in the Thunderdome. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the past two weeks, because of injuries and illness, Fullerton 
(4-12, 2-6 in conference) has been forced to practice with four or five 
players. Against Pacific last week, the Titans had seven players -- and only 
six were healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Practices have been, well, how would you describe them? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, I wasn't at practice all week," said guard Greg Vernon, who 
came back from the flu to score 10 points. "When I was in there on Wednesday, 
the guys were going hard playing two on two." 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Josh King, still recovering from oral surgery for impacted wisdom 
teeth, didn't make the trip to Santa Barbara. Vernon played after missing 
practice all week because of the flu. Darren Little returned after missing 
several practices and last week's Pacific game with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 David Frigout, who also missed the Pacific game, learned during a bone scan 
Monday that he has a stress fracture in his left foot. He played 23 minutes 
Thursday (four points, one rebound), and will have to play the rest of the 
season in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 But the person who made the most dramatic comeback was Titan guard James 
French. After having missed his last 15 three-point attempts, French scored a 
career-high 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 French, who led the Big West in three-point percentage in December but had 
gone the past three games without a basket, nailed five of six threes against 
the Gauchos (7-11, 3-5), including three of four to help put the game away in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans shot 53% on Thursday -- only the third time this season they were 
better than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to express to our team just how proud I am to coach them," said 
Holland, who is 2-0 at the Thunderdome after previous Titan teams had lost nine 
in a row here. "We haven't won a lot of games, but our two road wins (at Nevada 
and Santa Barbara) are real special. As much as I try and motivate them, they 
motivate me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans aren't the only ones who have been having difficulties lately. The 
Gauchos' loss Monday at Nevada Las Vegas was the end of a period during which 
they played 13 games -- 10 on the road -- in six weeks. During that span, they 
were at games and in vans, airplanes, buses, airports, hotels and foreign 
arenas for a total of 24 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, it looked like a game between two teams that have had their share of 
troubles this season. Although the Titans held Santa Barbara scoreless for the 
game's first 4 minutes 27 seconds, Fullerton soon went into a drought during 
which it scored three points in a 9:24 stretch. The Gauchos outscored 
Fullerton, 13-3, during that time, which is most of the reason why Santa 
Barbara led at the half, 24-21. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Titans were consistent in the second half and, thanks in part to Danny 
Robinson's baseline drive with 8:07 left and French's three-pointer with 1:30 
to play, outscored the Gauchos, 24-13, to finish the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I think (being short on players) brings us together," 
Vernon said. "We look to the bench and see we're not that deep and we know we 
need to play harder and smarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Holland wouldn't mind having a few extra players...

LONG BEACH TOO MUCH FOR MUMFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lloyd Mumford's one-man Harlem Globetrotter exhibition in the second half kept 
UC Irvine in Thursday night's game against Long Beach State and his two free 
throws with 10 seconds remaining in regulation sent the game into overtime. But 
the senior guard ran out of gas and magic as the 49ers scored a 111-106 Big 
West victory in front of 1,323 in Long Beach's campus gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford, who scored a career-high 31 points, scored on two reverse-pivot, 
360-degree looping bank shots. He drove around and through a host of 49ers for 
flying layups. He scored Irvine's first four points of overtime on two free 
throws and his patented herky-jerky drive to the basket. But he turned the ball 
over on a traveling call and missed a three-pointer as the 49ers worked the 
ball inside for three consecutive overtime layups to pull ahead, 98-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford's 31 points were the most by an Anteater since Jeff Herdman had 31 
against Cal State Fullerton on Feb. 21, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (5-10 and 2-5 in conference) closed to within three when Khalid 
Channell stole and inbound pass and made two free throws and then cut the 
margin to 106-104 when Chris Brown made an incredible hanging double-pump 
three-pointer with 17 seconds left in overtime. But the Anteaters couldn't 
overcome the 49ers' poise at the free-throw line with the game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (9-5, 4-3) made eight of 10 free throws in the final 2:20 of 
regulation and nine of 10 at the end of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams combined to shoot 105 free throws on the night. The NCAA record for 
a game is 130, set by Northern Arizona and Arizona in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Rod Hannibal led the 49ers with a career-high 29 points and forward 
James Cotton, who made all five shots he took in the first half, scored a 
career-high 27, including two layups in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just so proud of our kids," Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg said. "We 
really hung in there and we just found a way to win. But (Chris) Brown made 
some shots at the end of the game that only Michael Jordan makes. We thought we 
had it won several times, but they kept coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's perimeter shooting was a problem early, but Brown, a three-point 
specialist who hit only four of 21 shots in losses to Pacific and San Jose 
State last week, finished with 25 points, including six three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half was a sloppy foul-fest that deteriorated into a free-throw 
shooting contest that was almost as ugly as the play between fouls. Irvine made 
only 14 of 26 first-half free throws and Long Beach made 14 of 19 as the teams 
committed 27 fouls and 24 turnovers before the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 13-13, when the Anteaters allowed the 49ers to go on a 
run. This one was only a 10-1 spurt, minor by Irvine standards, but it was 
enough to put the 49ers ahead, 23-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach's defense had the Anteaters in a state of disarray and hardly able 
to complete a pass on the perimeter.

O.C. VIETNAMESE WANT GUARANTEE OF RIGHTS FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some leaders of Orange County's Vietnamese community are wary of President 
Clinton's plan to open trade with their homeland, saying they want assurances 
that lifting the embargo will be tied to a promise of improved civil liberties 
in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents and politicians worry that the United States is bowing too 
quickly to a former enemy. Others, namely in the business community, welcome 
the prospect of a new market overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Phong Duc Tran of the Vietnamese Community of Southern California said he is 
certain that if the United States begins trading with Vietnam, "many refugees 
will feel . . . as if the U.S. is supporting the Communists." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his organization will continue to oppose ending the embargo. "We are 
not going to surrender to the Communists just like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the U.S. Senate voted 62-38 Thursday in favor of a non-binding 
resolution to end the ban on American trade and investment with Vietnam, Tran 
said he believes the Senate was pressured by American business people bent on 
lifting the embargo "to make some dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Ban Binh Bui, who recently was elected president of the Vietnamese Community 
of Southern California, said President Clinton could lose support among 
Vietnamese Americans if he lifts the trade ban without first obtaining a 
guarantee of greater democracy in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope what President Clinton learns is that as a condition of lifting the 
embargo, that there has to be human rights and democracy," Bui said.  
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Robertson, a Santa Ana woman whose husband disappeared behind enemy 
lines in the Vietnam War, said she wants all living U.S. veterans in Vietnam 
returned to their families before any deal opening trade is made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it is our last bargaining chip to get our men home," said Robertson, 
who believes that her husband, Air Force Col. John Leighton Robertson, whose 
jet was shot down over Vietnam in 1966, may still be held by the Communist 
regime there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every politician, starting with (former Secretary of State Henry) Kissinger, 
has sold our POWs down the river and (the Senate's action) has really sunk the 
boat," she said. "It demonstrates a very cavalier attitude toward our fighting 
men."

 Some Orange County business owners, including some Vietnamese Americans, say 
free trade could benefit both the United States and Vietnam and even foster 
democracy for the people of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Wai Szeto, vice president of corporate development in Asia for Irvine-based 
AST Research Inc., one of the nation's largest computer manufacturers, said the 
opening of trade with Vietnam could help sustain the company's leadership in 
China and Hong Kong.  
</P>
<P>
 "Vietnam is geographically very close to Hong Kong," he said. "For us to tap 
into this emerging market is very convenient for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam could also prove an important market for Beckman Instruments, a major 
Fullerton-based manufacturer of medical and scientific research equipment, 
company spokeswoman Elke Eastman said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that removing the political barriers to trade will allow U.S. firms 
such as Beckman a chance to trade in a country where Japanese and European 
companies already are doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does represent a market with a chance for Beckman," Eastman said. "We look 
forward to supply the major hospitals in Vietnam with instruments and 
chemistries." 
</P>
<P>
 Co Pham, president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Orange County and 
the president of a building management company, said, "A lot of American 
businesses want to expand business in Vietnam. It would be the only way to 
forget the past, to help resolve the MIA issue and help Vietnamese (in the 
United States) export jobs and goods to Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham said a trade agreement would cut down black market trade. "A lot of 
Vietnamese (in the United States) have been doing business with Vietnam 
illegally," using alternate trade routes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once free trade is allowed, Pham said, the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce 
could serve as "the bridge" between American companies and prospective 
Southeast Asian customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see our role as very important," Pham said. "In the long run, it will 
bring the Vietnamese people toward democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 But two members of Orange County's congressional delegation denounced the 
Senate's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), whose district includes part of Orange 
County's Little Saigon, said some of his "best friends" in the Senate wrongly 
voted to lift the embargo "to heal the wounds of war."  
</P>
<P>
 But Dornan said the majority of senators were unknowingly motivated by 
"racism" because they ignored the overwhelming opposition of Vietnamese 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan also alleged that the Senate was unduly influenced by a few businessmen 
who want to take what Dornan perceives as the great "risk" of doing business 
with the government of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The senators "are putting dirty money against the pleading of the 
missing-in-action families who are totally against it," Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) criticized U.S. negotiators for not 
using economic leverage to win more human rights concessions from the Vietnam 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the largest market in the world and the most attractive trading partner, 
the United States has a strong bargaining position," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very easy to find instances in California and throughout the country 
where individual firms can profit from the lifting of this embargo. That is all 
to the good, but misses the point of whether the United States has negotiated 
to its best advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox condemned the Vietnam government as "among the worst violators of civil 
liberties and human rights in the entire world" and complained that while the 
United States government has discussed the POW-MIA issue in negotiations 
leading to the lifting of the trade embargo, it "simply dropped the ball" 
regarding civil rights violations. "Our policy has no consistent human rights 
focus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Lam, mayor pro-tem of Westminster and the owner of Vien Dong Restaurant 
in Garden Grove, said he has mixed feelings about ending the embargo.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it will be beneficial to the people of Vietnam," he said. 
"Let's cross our fingers that it would be beneficial to both countries."  
</P>
<P>
 Lam said he wants to know more about the details of the plan to lift the trade 
embargo, especially whether it will honor the Vietnamese American community's 
demands for the protection of human rights and releasing of political 
prisoners. "If we don't have any voice in the future of our homeland, it seems 
unfair," he said.

RENO'S TOP DEPUTY RESIGNS OVER DIFFERENCES IN 'STYLE'; SHAKE-UP: PHILIP HEYMANN 
SAYS THEY COULDN'T FUNCTION AS TEAM. SEPARATELY, ANOTHER ASSISTANT QUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department's second-ranking official resigned Thursday, saying 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno had decided that differences in their "operational and 
management styles" prevented them from functioning effectively as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 At an extraordinary press conference, with the two officials sitting 
side-by-side, Deputy Atty. Gen. Philip B. Heymann said he agreed with her in 
concluding that the "chemistry" between them has not been right. 
</P>
<P>
 Heymann's unexpected departure -- effective when a successor is chosen and 
available -- jolted a department already suffering from a yearlong inability to 
fill key posts. It climaxed Reno's growing irritation over Heymann's failure to 
complete assignments as quickly as she thought he should, according to several 
department sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance of disarray was heightened by the resignation of Reno's 
personal assistant, Lula Rodriguez, who is under investigation in Florida for 
alleged misdeeds in connection with her brother-in-law's successful campaign to 
become mayor of Hialeah. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez assisted the campaign of Raul Martinez by witnessing absentee-ballot 
signatures while in Florida. One of the absentee voters contends that her name 
was forged. The case is further complicated by the fact that Martinez is a 
convicted extortionist who ran for mayor while appealing his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who insists that she did nothing wrong, said she is leaving Feb. 5 
"to pursue other career opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Heymann, White House officials dismissed any suggestion that 
they had engineered his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "She (Reno) has to make decisions about how to run the department, and I guess 
we'll let their decisions speak for themselves," a senior White House official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a question, White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said 
President Clinton retains confidence in the attorney general and thinks she has 
"a real instinct for justice" and is doing a "terrific" job. 
</P>
<P>
 At their meeting with reporters, Reno and Heymann refused to discuss specifics 
of how their differences of chemistry and style have prevented them from 
working well as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Heymann chafed at the question of whether important matters had been stuck in 
his office, and Reno brushed aside the suggestion by saying that she had been 
"impressed" by the thoughtful review Heymann gave to matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no significant philosophical differences" between the two, Heymann 
said, "and there's no precipitating episode (or) disagreement on some 
particular matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, a knowledgeable source said, the differences between the two 
officials reflect Reno's penchant for keeping numerous policy and legal balls 
in the air at once, while Heymann favors working intensively on fewer projects 
and deferring those he regards as less important. 
</P>
<P>
 At weekly meetings with her top aides, Reno typically parcels out assignments 
and checks on how previously assigned matters are progressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phil repeatedly found himself . . . behind the eight ball," one source said. 
"I think he had some sense of despair that he was letting her down." 
</P>
<P>
 At staff meetings in recent weeks, the differences between the two became 
increasingly apparent, another source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation over a successor to Heymann centered on Ronald K. Noble, assistant 
Treasury secretary for enforcement; Irvin B. Nathan, Heymann's deputy; and 
Charles F.C. Ruff, a former Justice Department official and Watergate 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble, the highest-ranking African American in federal law enforcement, has 
won frequent praise from Reno for joint Treasury Department-Justice Department 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also known to have high professional regard for Nathan, who served 
under Heymann when he headed the department's criminal division during the 
Jimmy Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruff was in line for the deputy's job, but he was passed over because he had 
failed to pay Social Security taxes for a housekeeper. He then suggested 
Heymann to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration subsequently nominated more than 20 officials with similar 
tax problems, as long as they had paid the amounts they owed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ruff's case, the housekeeper was over age 65 and he was said to mistakenly 
believe that the deliquent Social Security taxes were no longer due. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department resignations overshadowed a sweeping FBI reorganization 
announced by Director Louis J. Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that "crime is at such dreadful levels and budgets so tight that we 
have no other choice," Freeh said he would move at least 600 FBI agents now in 
supervisory and administrative jobs to investigate priority criminal and 
national-security cases. 
</P>
<P>
 He told reporters at a press conference that the FBI's headquarters "has been 
top-heavy with supervisors and unnecessary levels of review and 
decision-making." 
</P>
<P>
 Some 300 agents will be moved out of the headquarters and back to 
investigating crime in the field, reducing the staff by 37%. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 300 agents doing administrative and non-investigative tasks in the 
FBI's 56 field offices will be moved to street-level criminal investigations.

FIRST VACCINE FOR CHICKENPOX PASSES KEY STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first vaccine to prevent chickenpox took a major step toward federal 
approval Thursday when a key advisory committee concluded that the experimental 
vaccine is safe and effective against the common childhood disease that 
afflicts 4 million children annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Chickenpox, a highly contagious illness characterized by fever, weakness and a 
rash that itches and blisters, is virtually the only significant childhood 
ailment for which there has been no approved vaccine. Vaccines already are in 
widespread use for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), measles, 
mumps, rubella (German measles) and polio, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nearly unanimous decision, the FDA vaccines advisory committee said: 
"There is available data to support claims of safety and efficacy for children, 
adolescents and adults." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased," said Dr. Gordon Douglas, president of Merck & Co.'s 
vaccine division, which developed the vaccine. "We believe the vaccine is safe 
and effective, and will be a big advance in terms of children's health in this 
country. We think that prevention is always far preferable to treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While advisory committee decisions and recommendations are not binding on the 
agency, they typically wield considerable influence in FDA decision-making. If 
approval comes quickly, the vaccine could be available by summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Merck, which is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., told the 
committee that its studies have shown the vaccine to be highly effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jo White, senior director of the company's research laboratories, told the 
committee that in a controlled study, the vaccine "provided 98% protection from 
. . . disease following one dose of vaccine in healthy children (whose progress 
was) followed for two years." 
</P>
<P>
 In follow-up studies of more than 9,000 children over 12 years old, only 1% to 
3% of them developed a mild form of the disease after they were exposed, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Research conducted in a household setting -- where exposure typically results 
in severe disease -- demonstrated that the vaccine provided 98% protection, she 
said. She defined severe disease as cases in which an individual had "300 
lesions or more and a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher." 
</P>
<P>
 In its submissions to the FDA, the company has suggested that children 1 to 12 
years old receive a single dose of the vaccine and that those 13 or older, 
including adults, be given two doses one to two months apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The vaccine has caused minimal side effects in a small percentage of children 
-- with a mild rash the most serious. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar vaccine already is in use in Japan, Korea and several countries in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will be a very important addition to our vaccine arsenal," said 
Dr. Richard Duma, executive director of the National Foundation for Infectious 
Diseases. "There are a lot of studies that indicate the vaccine will be 
cost-effective, that at least $4 or $5 will be saved for every dollar spent," 
Duma added. " If it is used widely, I think there's a very good chance we can 
basically wave goodby to chickenpox." 
</P>
<P>
 In normal, otherwise healthy children, chickenpox, or varicella, generally is 
a benign disease, although the rash can be quite severe. In some cases, 
complications can occur, resulting in hospitalizations and even deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Children can get very sick from it -- they are uncomfortable, they lose time 
from school, and parents have to stay home and take care of them," Merck's 
Douglas said. "Some get very sick and about 9,000 get hospitalized, and there 
are some deaths in normal children every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Complications can include bacterial skin infections arising from the rash and, 
more rarely, encephalitis (infection of the brain), meningitis (infections of 
the covering of the brain) and Reye's syndrome, a sometimes fatal illness that 
results when aspirin is given to children suffering from chickenpox or flu. 
</P>
<P>
 For most people, however -- including children who get sick and the parents 
who must stay home and care for them -- chickenpox is an uncomfortable, costly 
and inconvenient nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 After the disease, individuals usually maintain a lifelong immunity to 
chickenpox and do not suffer further episodes. But the virus can reactivate 
later in life as shingles, a painful skin condition.

SENATE URGES END TO HANOI EMBARGO; VIETNAM: AFTER TWO DAYS OF HEATED DEBATE, 
LAWMAKERS RECOMMEND 62-38 THAT CLINTON DROP SANCTIONS IMPOSED AS A RESULT OF 
THE WAR. VETERAN, MIA GROUPS OBJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate, responding to appeals to help heal the last wounds of the Vietnam 
War, voted overwhelmingly Thursday to recommend that President Clinton lift the 
trade embargo enforced against Vietnam for nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-38 vote concluded an impassioned two-day debate, in which one side 
pleaded for normal relations with Vietnam while the other urged the 
Administration to wait until the Vietnamese government has accounted more fully 
for U.S. servicemen missing in Southeast Asia since the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the resolution is not binding, it calls on the President to end the 
embargo "as expeditiously" as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the White House has signaled that the President is 
approaching a decision on whether to lift the embargo. But White House Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers said after Thursday's vote that while Clinton welcomed 
the "Senate's sentiment" on the issue, he had made no final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the President wants to be certain first that the Vietnamese are 
being fully cooperative on the POW-MIA issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The embargo was imposed against North Vietnam in 1964 and extended to cover 
all of Vietnam after the fall of the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government on 
April 30, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 It has prohibited all trade with Vietnam since the end of the war but has been 
relaxed slightly in recent months to permit some businesses to make initial 
forays there. The President has sole authority to lift it by executive order. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the Senate recommendation, who included some of the most 
decorated Vietnam War veterans in Congress, clearly hoped that the vote would 
help alleviate some of the political vulnerability that Clinton faces over the 
highly sensitive issue. He has had less maneuverability on the matter than some 
other presidents might have had, because he avoided the draft during the war 
and never served in the armed forces -- and has been harshly criticized on both 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate action Thursday was met with dismay by veterans organizations and 
groups representing the relatives of American servicemen still listed as 
missing in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the vote fell, coincidentally, on the anniversary of the treaty 
that ended U.S. involvement in the war, the National League of Families accused 
the senators of capitulating to pressures from business groups seeking 
opportunities to trade with Vietnam and to invest in the nation's 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, (on) the 21st anniversary of the Paris Accords . . . 62 U.S. senators 
handed Vietnam a major victory and may have irretrievably destroyed answers for 
POW-MIA families on the fate of their relatives in the bargain," the league 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very disappointed," added John Sommer, executive director of the 
Washington office of the American Legion. "Once the embargo is lifted, Vietnam 
will have no reason to continue to cooperate" in the effort to account for 
missing servicemen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of normal relations between the United States and Vietnam rejected 
those sentiments, however, arguing in sometimes bitter debate on the Senate 
floor that Hanoi has made significant progress in accounting for the missing 
servicemen. Furthermore, they said, the best way to resolve the remaining cases 
is to improve ties with Vietnam and establish a larger American presence there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't proceed forward we can lose the ability to get the answers we are 
getting today," said Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a Vietnam War veteran who 
served as chairman of a yearlong Senate investigation into the POW-MIA issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to serve the families, you will vote to lift the embargo. If you 
want to put the war behind us . . . and protect the interests of this nation, 
you will vote to lift the embargo," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Official records still list more than 2,200 servicemen as missing in Southeast 
Asia, but U.S. officials said that the actual number of unresolved cases 
actually now totals no more than a few dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Most family and veterans groups have maintained, however, that the total is 
much higher and includes POWs who were alive at the end of the war but never 
released by Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Their champion in the Senate debate, Sen. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.), argued 
that Vietnam continues to withhold information in its possession about the fate 
of the missing men and that the embargo remains "the only bargaining chip we 
have to negotiate for their return." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most lawmakers, however, were clearly influenced by the fact that some of the 
Senate's most honored Vietnam veterans were among those arguing the most 
passionately for an end to the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't often discuss my past experiences in the Vietnam War," said Sen. John 
McCain (R-Ariz.), who spent six years as a POW in Vietnam. "But every name I 
knew has been accounted for," he added.  
</P>
<P>
 Also supporting the recommendation were Vietnam veterans Sen. Bob Kerrey 
(D-Neb.), a Congressional Medal of Honor winner who lost part of his leg in the 
war; Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.), and Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). 
</P>
<P>
 Two who served in Vietnam voted no: Sen. Hank Brown (R-Colo.) and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official said the Senate vote had helped to "lay the 
groundwork" for a decision to lift the embargo by providing the necessary 
political cover if Clinton decides to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting the recommendation, which was attached to a $12-billion foreign aid 
authorization bill, were 20 Republicans and 42 Democrats, including 
California's Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.

TASK FORCE ON THE TRAIL OF POST-QUAKE PRICE GOUGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man in the big office with the cushy chair could not believe the words 
coming from the woman sitting across from him with the clipboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Was she really accusing him of being a price gouger? Was he actually going to 
be hauled into a hearing in City Hall? Stammering as he learned the unfortunate 
answers, the prosperous chimney repair man offered a spirited defense and 
acknowledged that perhaps mistakes were made in the post-quake rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want price gougers to be nailed as much as you do," he said. "I think it's 
crummy to take advantage of people in a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's anti-gouging task force landed on the chimney fixer's doorstep 
after receiving five telephone complaints against him. They were among about 
900 calls that have flooded an earthquake fraud hot line in the last week and a 
half. In response, authorities are setting administrative hearings for alleged 
price gougers and using undercover investigators to trap unlicensed 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fern Collins, an investigator with the Los Angeles County Department of 
Consumer Affairs, nodded politely to the chimney man. But despite his pleas of 
innocence, she set up an appointment for him with the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, dozens of business owners have received such notices and four 
contractors have been arrested for operating without a license. The same 
multi-agency task force is targeting fraudulent charities, shady insurance 
adjusters and others whom authorities expect to move into the disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's price-gouging law forbids merchants and contractors to raise their 
prices on certain essential goods more than 10% above pre-disaster levels. 
Violators can be fined $1,000 and jailed for up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 In the closed-door hearings on the 16th floor of City Hall, merchants have 
offered cash register receipts, advertisements and elaborate explanations to 
defend their pricing policies. Some of the cases have been immediately dropped 
by prosecutors, but the more blatant examples are still being reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 The chimney man said his company used untrained estimators during the 
post-quake chaos and acknowledged that they might have made some mistakes. He 
said the company was offering refunds to compensate for any price 
discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
 A doughnut shop owner, meanwhile, used testimonial letters praising his baked 
goods in an attempt to appease investigators. Another defense being raised is 
one rarely heard during normal times -- owners arguing that their prices have 
always been higher than competitors'. 
</P>
<P>
 The post-quake chaos, during which many cash registers were out of operation, 
is blamed for some overbilling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have hundreds of signatures from my customers saying I didn't price gouge," 
said Dilip Patel, who attended a hearing Thursday and successfully defended his 
North Hollywood mini-market. "A cashier may have made one mistake during the 
rush but I am not a price gouger." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of exorbitant prices -- a gallon of orange juice for $15, a gallon of 
water for $10 and a gallon of gas for $1.60 -- have flooded the hot line. 
Convenience stores have been the biggest culprits, officials say, but 
supermarkets, movers, gas stations, hardware stores and restaurants have also 
drawn complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are also on the lookout for unlicensed contractors. Undercover 
operations organized by the Contractors State License Board have netted four 
illegal workers at two homes. Other stings are planned in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Councilwoman Laura Chick lent her damaged home in Woodland Hills to 
one sting and the district attorney's office filed felony charges this week 
against two unlicensed workers who offered to fix a crumbling wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people who take advantage of vulnerable folks, victims of disasters, 
are the very lowest," Chick said at a news conference Thursday. "I don't think 
they have the kind of scruples and principles that most of us share in our 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 Pablo Salazar Rodriquez, 35, of North Hollywood and Ignacio De Los Santos, 31, 
of San Fernando were charged with felony unlicensed contracting during a state 
of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Rodriquez offered to repair the wall for $14,100, while 
Santos estimated $17,460. Both the bids were about right for the job, but 
officials said the work performed by those without licenses is often shoddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other men were arrested in Burbank after they made a deal with an 
undercover investigator to repair a chimney. They offered bids much lower than 
the estimated $2,500 cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractors board conducted similar stings after the 1992 Los Angeles 
riots and last fall's Southern California wildfires, resulting in seven 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The city approved its price-gouging restrictions in 1992 after officials found 
that they had few legal tools to fight skyrocketing prices after the riots. 
There was little debate at the time, but some business owners now say privately 
that they ought to be able to charge whatever they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ordinance is not on the books every day," said Deputy City Atty. Ruth 
Kwan, who heads the task force. "It's only there during a state of emergency. . 
. . Supply and demand is what makes this country so successful. But there are 
situations when you are balancing the health, safety and welfare of the people 
with the free setting of prices." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, other governmental bodies have passed similar measures. 
Los Angeles and Ventura counties have prepared emergency price-gouging laws of 
their own and Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) said he intends to 
introduce legislation that would impose a statewide price-gouging prohibition 
during disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles task force is focusing on businesses that have been the 
subject of multiple complaints to the hot line, which is answered by volunteers 
in the county Hall of Administration. The accused owners are first given 
appointments to defend themselves at the city attorney's office. The city then 
decides whether to proceed with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no charges have been filed. However, the Southland Corp., using 
undercover shoppers of its own, has said it will terminate the franchises of 
eight 7-Eleven Store operators for raising prices excessively. 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups are getting involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Organized in Community Efforts (VOICE), a grass-roots religious group 
made up of Protestant, Catholic and Jewish congregations, is planning a 
store-to-store campaign in Pacoima on Saturday to pressure owners into signing 
a covenant denouncing price gouging. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the days following the earthquake, some of my parishioners told me of 
being charged $3 for a gallon of water and $10 for a bag of charcoal," said the 
Rev. Tom Rush of Mary Immaculate Church in Pacoima. "I have also heard some 
stores doubled the price of batteries, baby formula and (diapers)."

COLUMN ONE; STANDING BY THEIR OLYMPIAN; TONYA HARDING HASN'T ALWAYS MADE IT 
EASY FOR PORTLAND TO LOVE HER. BUT SOME HOMETOWN FANS REMAIN TRUE DESPITE A 
MEDIA CIRCUS AND THE TANGLE OF QUESTIONS SURROUNDING THE ASSAULT ON HER RIVAL.

<P>
 What is a hometown to do with Tonya Harding? 
</P>
<P>
 Never has it been easy or particularly warm, this relationship between the 
hotheaded, gritty ice skater and the cool, placid Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 And today . . . well, today Portlanders are bug-eyed at what has swept over 
their community, and a good many are asking: When is enough too much? 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's tearful admission Thursday that she learned details of the attack on 
Nancy Kerrigan after it had occurred -- and had withheld the information from 
authorities -- is just the latest twist in a long, much twisted plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that revelation, Harding is not without her vigorous hometown backers. 
"That poor girl needs support," says Jan Hancock, who regularly watches 
Harding's practice sessions at the local mall ice rink. "We live in a country 
where you are innocent until proven guilty." Even if Harding is arrested, 
Hancock insists, "there is incredible good in her. I believe in her." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters, young skaters and retirees have rallied around Harding. Hundreds 
are drawn to her practices at the Clackamas Town Center. Hand-drawn banners 
declare fans' loyalty to the 23-year-old skater and their collective thumbing 
of the nose at those who doubt. "We love you Tonya," says one sign. "Deal With 
It America." 
</P>
<P>
 Sympathetic counselors and Harding's friends have tried to focus community 
understanding on the abuse and rootlessness in Harding's background, which they 
say may explain some of her troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people blame her woes on her volatile ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, 26, an 
unemployed warehouseman. He and three other men have been arrested in 
connection with the Jan. 6 attack in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Guilt or innocence aside, many here seem to support Harding's right to a fair 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Others just throw up their hands in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things look different here. That's Oregon's state motto," one City Hall 
official says. "These days, things really look different." 
</P>
<P>
 The Portland Oregonian has covered the Harding story with a vengeance, and by 
most accounts has done an unusually comprehensive job. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oregonian editors say they are surprised how few letters they have 
received in response, which is to say darned few. And most of those are not 
concerned with Harding or Kerrigan, but are "critical of the extensive 
coverage," says Forum Editor Robert M. Landauer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're saying basically that her accusers are blowhards, people with the 
stature of slug bait -- that's the kind of language they're using. They're 
asking us to suspend judgment (on Harding) based on these people all trying to 
cut themselves a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly overwhelmed county law enforcement officials seem to be proceeding 
with energy more fitting an assassination than a case of second-degree assault. 
This, despite Dist. Atty. Michael Schrunk's own characterization that the crime 
was "committed by the Three Stooges." 
</P>
<P>
 And the forces propelling this -- The Biggest Little Case in the West -- seem 
unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Thursday's press conference, Harding had become Oregon's dominant 
news figure, pushing sexual harassment claims against Sen. Bob Packwood 
(R-Ore.) onto the back pages and relegating a shocking triple murder to 
also-ran coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this, the downtown area, the suburban Clackamas ice rink, the 
winding roads in the outlands have become something new and strange for this 
corner of the Northwest: A breathless news beat. Parking lots are dotted with 
TV satellite trucks. Masses of men and women with cameras and note pads shuffle 
down sidewalks from the FBI office to the courthouse to the jail, recording 
every move. There she goes! She's walking into her house to get her overnight 
bag. She's at a bingo hall. Where? Oops, never mind.  
</P>
<P>
 "So, we have some young skater who has problems with her husband and some 
other young skater gets bopped on the knee. That kind of stuff belongs on the 
human interest pages. But this ?" says businessman Ron Ennis, his voice rising. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might stand back and ask what kind of hyper-competition leads to this kind 
of hideous act. What kind of world are we creating? But that's not what is 
going on. . . . There are important things we should be paying attention to. 
What is it about us that we want to read every scrap about this?" 
</P>
<P>
 No less than in any American city, residents say, there is serious crime in 
Portland -- and a feeling that it is out of control. The Harding case has 
raised doubts about allocation of media attention and law enforcement 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of the Harding affair, three women were shot execution-style at a 
service station just a dozen miles away in suburban Gresham. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I empathize with Tonya and Nancy. But there are three people dead here," says 
Lila Leathers, the station's owner. 
</P>
<P>
 A legion of sheriff's deputies, FBI agents and law enforcement authorities 
have been deployed in four states on the Harding case. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes Oregonian columnist Steve Duin wonder, "Is something out of 
balance?" -- noting that the city has only six police officers investigating 
the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, residents criticize a trip last weekend by two prosecutors and 
two FBI agents who went to Los Angeles to brief the visiting Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something wrong with the telephone?" Duin demands. "Let's remember this 
boondoggle when the county argues it doesn't have the resources to keep our 
streets safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Oregonian columnist, Dwight Jaynes, derides the trip as "a dream date 
in Los Angeles with Nancy Kerrigan. . . . Nothing they wouldn't do for any of 
us in a second-degree assault case, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even the radio talk show hosts fear the story has been overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to move people elsewhere. It does get a little stale, you know," 
says KKEY morning host Al Emrichtt. 
</P>
<P>
 But not yet stale for Hollywood, the literary promoters and the others with 
promises of cash and glory. A spokeswoman for Harding's attorney -- yes, it has 
reached the point where Portland lawyers now have their own stand-ins -- said 
the offers now number in the dozens. "We're asking people to put them in 
writing and we'll keep them in a file. Right now, we're concentrating on the 
legal case," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 A local minister who provided a major break in the case was astonished by a 
tabloid TV show's offer of $30,000 for an interview. And one "promoter" was 
able to grab media attention with the idea of a $5-million, winner-take-all 
skate-off between the two women after the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no denying that the stories of both skaters are now stranger than 
fiction and, therefore, perfect for quick exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
 But what brought them to this point? 
</P>
<P>
 Harding began life as one of those rare youngsters who knew what she wanted 
from age 3. That's when she started skating. She grew up, moving from house to 
house with her frequently married, waitress mother. She has been close to her 
father, particularly lately, but hardly knew her much older stepbrothers and 
stepsister. 
</P>
<P>
 Only through raw determination and the support -- financial and otherwise -- 
from people in Portland did Harding get her chance to bloom as a skater. She 
did it her own way, sometimes with a cigarette in her mouth. But don't we all 
have a soft spot for a rebel? 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Portland has to pick from two Hardings. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so long ago, she was sponsored by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oregon and 
made the rounds of the chambers of commerce, toured the pediatric wards, 
appeared at the factories and skated in exhibitions around the state -- just 
like favorite-daughter figure skaters are supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also the jolting counter-image of the police arriving at the 
scene of a traffic altercation. There was Harding two years ago, standing in 
the street brandishing a baseball bat, furious because the woman in front of 
her did not turn right on a red light. Or how about the police reports over the 
years about her violent fights with Gillooly? These are now spiced with stories 
of Harding's mother beating her with a hairbrush when her skating was 
unsatisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a rags-to-riches tale without a Hollywood finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harding has forced us to see exactly what many people's rags are made of," 
Nigel D. Wrangham, a counselor who treats abused women, said in an essay in the 
Oregonian. "It isn't pretty. Abusive parental relationships, violent episodes 
and rootlessness. We prefer Cinderella, thank you. And Nancy Kerrigan will do. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a product of the worst of throwaway American culture, and it's OK to 
hate her because you can't be called a racist for it. . . . She has shown us 
that, in the real world, chaotic relationships often involve a good deal more 
than the latest update on 'Entertainment Tonight.' They involve fists, hair 
pulling, gunfire and restraining orders." 
</P>
<P>
 That Harding has come this far despite such problems is enough for the cadre 
of fans, many wearing pink "We Believe in Tonya" buttons, who turn out daily to 
watch her practice and to sound off to the massed media. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday at the Clackamas rink, Hancock was holding fan club applications 
and selling buttons. "I used to walk the mall for exercise and would see Tonya 
practicing about 7:30 a.m. each morning," she said. "She is an incredible 
skater. I'd spoken to her once and she was very nice to me." 
</P>
<P>
 While Harding has had a love-hate relationship with her hometown, a continent 
away and worlds apart, New England has long considered Kerrigan its sweetheart. 
She was raised north of Boston in Stoneham, Mass., a town of white, steepled 
churches and small, single-family dwellings. If you happen to smash up your 
car, Stoneham is a great place to be. It abounds in body shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's father is a welder. Her mother, who is legally blind, nonetheless 
diligently follows her daughter's performances. Her two older brothers, both 
clean-cut and handsome, serve as family spokesmen. They are the kind of people 
who bring doughnuts and hot coffee to the horde of reporters massed in their 
driveway on a snowy morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after she was attacked, the local weekly newspaper published a large 
drawing in lieu of an editorial. It showed Kerrigan skating with a heart drawn 
around her and the words, "We love you, Nancy." 
</P>
<P>
 In Boston, the Harding-Kerrigan story also dominates the news. On TV these 
days, Kerrigan's practice sessions precede even the sacrosanct weather reports 
in importance. 
</P>
<P>
 And while attempting objectivity, the local media have not been kind to 
Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston Herald dubbed Harding the "Pam Smart of the ice," likening her to 
the New Hampshire schoolteacher who hired one of her students to kill her 
husband and asked the teen-ager not to get blood on the white leather 
furniture. 
</P>

 Loyal fans turn out daily to watch Tonya Harding practice. They also sound off 
in the Oregonian, though the letters to the editor are not unanimous in their 
praises.

 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
</P>
<P>
 * "I am sickened by the innuendo and rumor about Tonya Harding. The "True 
Grit" she has shown in her life is the stuff books and movies couldn't 
adequately convey. Tonya says she knew nothing about the alleged plot. I 
believe her." -- Virginia B. Moore 
</P>
<P>
 * "I am proud to be an Oregonian. I am proud that Tonya Harding is from our 
state and represents it so well. I am not proud of the way in which local and 
national news media have always portrayed her." -- Karen Hudson 
</P>
<P>
 * "Americans are guaranteed the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness. Tonya Harding should not be denied the pursuit of her happiness 
through competing in the Olympics, unless she has been found guilty of planning 
to keep Nancy Kerrigan from her pursuit of happiness." -- Janet Klecker 
</P>
<P>
 * "...as an ambassador of Oregon and perhaps the United States, (Harding) just 
doesn't get it: what it truly means to be an ambassador. It's not necessary to 
play the hardened, tough cookie -- after all, this isn't roller derby or drag 
racing."

SIGOLOFF DROPS BID FOR TOP SCHOOLS JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles businessman Sanford C. Sigoloff, with his prospects for 
confirmation apparently doomed, Thursday withdrew from consideration for the 
post of California schools chief and accepted an appointment to the State Board 
of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigoloff's surprise announcement came two months after Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson nominated him as superintendent of public instruction and less than a 
week before the Democrat-controlled Legislature was expected to grill the 
corporate turnaround artist about his qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigoloff's nomination faced mounting opposition from schoolteachers and unions 
and, without a high-profile lobbying effort by Wilson, was faltering. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Wilson, Sigoloff said "partisan politics, combined with an 
educational establishment resistant to change, make it highly unlikely that . . 
. I or anyone else will be confirmed before the election." 
</P>
<P>
 He told Wilson that he is still committed to renewing the state's education 
system and described the 11-member Board of Education as "the most appropriate" 
arena "for creating the agenda of change" for children in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wilson's help, Sigoloff is likely to be chosen president of the board and 
exercise the broad authority it won last year in a state appeals court 
decision. Historically, the board has had power over such items as textbooks 
and the schools chief has been the visible policy-maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigoloff may seek to elevate the board's profile, setting up a power struggle 
with whoever wins a four-year term in the superintendent's job in this year's 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "On the Board of Education," Wilson said in a prepared statement, "he can 
sustain the effort required to free our public schools from micromanagement and 
mountains of regulations and paperwork that cost time and money and should 
instead be spent on improving classroom teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also said he regretted that children "will not enjoy" Sigoloff's 
leadership but noted that, if confirmed by the Senate, Sigoloff will be on the 
state board for four years -- much longer than the 10-month term as state 
schools chief. The Senate has a year to act on the nomination, during which 
Sigoloff will serve on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigoloff's decision is a setback for Wilson; the governor has spent most of a 
year searching to fill the schools chief post since Supt. of Public Instruction 
Bill Honig was forced to resign on Feb. 24, 1993, after he was sentenced on 
conflict-of-interest charges. Wilson's first choice, Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach), a former teacher and school board member, was rejected by 
the Assembly on a partisan vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Wilson Administration indicated that they do not expect the 
governor to make a third selection to succeed Honig. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping that an educational outsider would pass muster with legislators, Wilson 
in November nominated Sigoloff, 63, best known as a corporate turnaround 
specialist, to help rescue the state's foundering public school system. 
Sigoloff teaches a course at UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management and 
is chairman of a consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment drew initial praise from business leaders and Senate 
Democratic leaders, in part because Sigoloff would not seek election to the 
post and agreed to craft a plan to turn around the state's schools. But while 
Sigoloff met with some legislators and educators, he and his backers in the 
Administration failed to capitalize on the momentum generated by his 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigoloff, whose lean frame and terse comments became familiar to TV viewers in 
the 1980s from his "We got the message, Mr. Sigoloff" ads for the now-defunct 
Builders Emporium chain, is widely regarded in business circles for his ability 
to salvage debt-laden companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sigoloff reportedly refused to lobby legislators and conduct a hard-sell 
campaign to win a job he was willing to take for no salary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of explanations were given for the failure of the appointment to 
generate a groundswell of support. 
</P>
<P>
 One education lobbyist said Sigoloff, a physicist by training, seemed arrogant 
and unfamiliar with the nuts and bolts of the job. Another said Sigoloff 
snubbed an invitation to talk to his group's members. Others said that recent 
surgery slowed Sigoloff's bid to win the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, as the hearings approached, some unions that had tangled with Sigoloff 
were launching an effort to stop the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination suffered a major blow earlier this week when the California 
Teachers Assn., the state's largest teacher union, announced it would oppose 
Sigoloff's appointment because he did not have the education credentials for 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Republican legislators said they doubted if Democrats, closely 
allied with the teachers' group, would have approved any Wilson nominee. 
Assemblyman Robert J. Campbell (D-Martinez), a member of an Assembly committee 
that was set to review Sigoloff next Wednesday, said the executive's chances of 
winning confirmation were "slim and none." Campbell said Sigoloff "didn't know 
anything about education" and would have had only 10 months' on-the-job 
training before he would have had to relinquish the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said that acting schools chief William D. Dawson is performing well and 
Democrats see no reason to upset the status quo, especially since one of their 
own, Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont) is a leading candidate for 
election to the job. 
</P>
<P>
 One education source said that Sigoloff's withdrawal "clears the air" for a 
fight in the June primary election between Eastin and Maureen DiMarco, Wilson's 
education adviser, who is strongly considering entering the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin said she thought the outcome of the hearing would have turned on 
Sigoloff's testimony and that committee members were open-minded. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview before his withdrawal, Sigoloff said he planned to testify by 
himself, without aides, and, unlike most high-profile appointees, not bring any 
character witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm coming alone," Sigoloff said Wednesday. "All I need is an outlet for my 
laptop (computer)." 
</P>
<P>
 Sigoloff said he has been sifting through the pluses and minuses in state 
education. In the process, he said he determined that just throwing money at 
the problems was not satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who assailed Bergeson, kept a 
low profile on the Sigoloff nomination. But on Thursday he said he was pleased 
by Sigoloff's decision because he had advised him to seek some other job if he 
wanted to conduct an in-depth look at schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The superintendent's job is to worry about the toilet paper and the light 
bulbs in 1,100 schools," Brown said, and there wouldn't be "time to do a whole 
lot of comprehensive thinking about how to deal with the system."

ANGELENOS ON EDGE FROM CONTINUING AFTERSHOCKS; AFTERMATH: EACH MAJOR JOLT -- 
LIKE THURSDAY'S 4.5 -- SENDS THE SKITTISH SCURRYING. BUT SOME JUST SHRUG THE 
SHAKERS OFF. 
</P>

<P>
 With each major aftershock, the cracks riddling every corner of Renee 
Cronenwalt's house grow a little bigger and she grows a little glummer.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a subtle feeling of whether we had the Big One or the Big One is yet 
to come," said Cronenwalt, who lives off Mulholland Drive in what was a big, 
beautiful house. "We had a lot of damage in our house, and every time we have 
an aftershock we have a little more damage and I'm overwhelmed with all the 
work that needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Creaking and groaning like a giant settling into a new seat, the Los Angeles 
Basin has been hit by more than 3,000 aftershocks since last week's 6.6 
magnitude earthquake in Northridge -- including a 4.5 magnitude aftershock 
Thursday morning -- and seismologists are still counting. Hundreds have been 
strong enough to be felt, robbing people of a sense of everyday security. No 
sooner do the grinding sounds and frightening images of last week recede than a 
jolt revives them. It has become the disaster that just won't go away, turning 
the quake-weary into skittish cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Stubba is one of those for whom the aftershocks are more traumatic than 
their 6.6 precursor. "The aftershocks are the most unnerving," said Stubba, 
whose Thousand Oaks home survived the Jan. 17 temblor undamaged. "They just 
don't stop. Thirty seconds was one thing. But all the others are adding up to 
much more than 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that no matter how long between them, my nerves are right on the edge. 
As soon as one hits, I'm shaking again." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbette Fleschler of Chatsworth braces herself during every aftershock and 
jumps at the slightest noise, wondering what is coming next. "Oh no, here we go 
again," she thinks. Her 3-year-old daughter, Aviva, who slept through the Jan. 
17 quake, has a more dramatic reaction to its aftershocks. She falls to the 
floor and pounds it with her fist, exclaiming "Now that's enough! Stop that!" 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday morning's aftershock sent the staff in Howard Bragman's public 
relations office diving under their desks for at least the sixth time in the 
past 10 days. "There's no shame in our being under our desks. We've learned to 
like it," joked Bragman, whose Beverly Hills office has lots of glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, when a swarm of aftershocks roiled the region, Bragman took his 
phone under his desk and started making business calls from there. His dog -- 
which he often takes to work -- joined him. He also spent a lot of time calming 
his staff. "I had three different people come in and break down. One person 
just went away for the weekend. . . . A second person went to visit her family 
in Florida for the week." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly two weeks of shaking, aftershocks have started to take on the 
routine of wartime air raids, just one more disquieting twist to life in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've finally gotten used to it," said Carmen Roldan of Silver Lake. When a 
3.8 shaking hit Wednesday morning at almost exactly the same time as the Jan. 
17 quake, Roldan simply rolled over in bed. "I said, 'That's it, I give up.' 
You just have to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are those who greet the continuing jostling with the bravado of 
veterans, shrugging off the aftershocks with barely a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a salesman, nothing bothers me," declared Steven Rosenthal, whose office 
is in Van Nuys. "I hope a lot of people move out," he said, grinning. "It's too 
crowded. If this scares 'em -- good. Less traffic for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal no doubt fits into the first of three coping categories described by 
Dr. Louis Jolyon West, a UCLA professor of psychiatry. Those who cope the most 
easily are highly adaptive, becoming less anxious with each aftershock. 
"Through a process of what can be called emotional learning, they have learned 
what the parameters of risk might be" and can reassure themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the second group, encompassing perhaps the largest number of people, 
respond about the same to each repeated stress, in this case, aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the third group, each aftershock makes things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an accumulative stress response," West explained. "It's almost as 
though with each progressive repetition of stressful experience, their ability 
to cope decreases and their emotional reaction increases. They become more and 
more vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 People subject to that cumulative effect will suddenly burst into tears or 
decide they have to get out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aftershocks here just keep bringing it right back to everybody's 
consciousness," observed J. Richard Elpers, a professor of psychiatry at 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. "Part of healing is to get some sense of security 
back and getting back to normal things. . . . Each aftershock will delay that 
process and remind us of what we're afraid of." 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are so unpredictable, earthquakes are in some ways more 
terrifying than other natural disasters. And each shaker of the past two weeks 
reminds people of that unpredictability. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing quakes are exacting a particularly hard psychological toll in the 
traumatized San Fernando Valley -- the big quake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities have pronounced his Reseda apartment safe to re-enter, 
Jeff Estrin is still too nervous to go back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time going back to my apartment, especially my bedroom," Estrin 
said, his voice shaking. "I went back and sat on my bed but the anxiety builds 
up and my heart begins to race and I have to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake knocked Estrin's entertainment center to the ground, and when he put 
it back up, an aftershock knocked it down again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have lived through other earthquakes. I don't remember them (aftershocks) 
being so long and so hard," said Estrin, who is staying with his sister-in-law, 
Gena Estrin. "They are kind of like 'Boom! Here I am.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's magnitude 4.5 aftershock prompted some parents to pick up their 
children from Valley schools. At Osceola Elementary in Sylmar, students in one 
class sat on the floor hugging stuffed animals they had brought to school at 
their teacher's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 At some Red Cross shelters in the Valley, people rush outside at every strong 
aftershock. Some get hysterical. "If you are constantly in fear you can't (get) 
beyond that," observed Raedeen McGowan, a Red Cross assistant mental health 
officer who flew in from Omaha to offer counseling to quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily shaking is giving her a first taste of life on the fault lines. "For 
many of us this is our first opportunity to come out and shake and roll with 
you folks," McGowan added. "I know I kind of lie awake and think, 'When is this 
going to happen?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even far from the epicenter, in places where the Northridge earthquake barely 
nudged the furniture, the steady succession of aftershocks has kept people on 
edge. "It made me realize it is not that far away," Debra Washington, a clerk 
at the South Bay Pavilion shopping mall in Carson, said after Thursday 
morning's quake. "We all live in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Gardener, a manufacturers' representative who works out of her home in 
Monrovia, chuckled nervously. "I just keep wondering how long our luck here 
will hold," she said. "The San Gabriel Valley has been really unreasonably 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Athens-area resident Noel Garcia, who works at a sporting goods store in 
Carson, said he has come to regard earthquakes as nature's version of drive-by 
shootings and robberies: There is nothing anyone can do about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could happen right now, right here, just as we are standing here," Garcia 
said. "Unfortunately, it is something you have to live with in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when there aren't any aftershocks, the hypervigilant feel what some are 
calling "phantom quakes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have felt more aftershocks than there have been," admitted Stubba. "I'm at 
the photocopy machine and I think, 'Oh, my God.' There's a motion problem 
that's not over yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The rhythm of temblors has made for many a sleepless night for Darin Flannes 
of Santa Clarita. Still, he says, his newly torturous commute to work in the 
San Fernando Valley is worse. "I can live with the aftershocks a lot better 
than the freeways. There's no way I can get used to a three-hour journey in the 
morning."

HARDING KNEW DETAILS OF ATTACK LATER, KEPT SILENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR and RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tears welling in her eyes and her lips quivering, Tonya Harding confessed 
Thursday that she knew about the plot to attack rival Nancy Kerrigan after the 
fact and did not report it to police. But Harding steadfastly said she was not 
involved and knew nothing of the assault beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 She pleaded, all but begged to remain on the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have devoted my entire life to one objective: winning an Olympic gold medal 
for my country. This is my last chance. I ask only for your understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the U.S. Olympic Committee issued a statement later saying it was 
"deeply concerned" about Harding's admission, and the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. 
said it formed a five-member committee to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year-old Harding, the U.S. national women's figure skating champion, 
ended her long, self-imposed silence about the strange case, reading a prepared 
statement slowly and emotionally to reporters at the Multnomah Athletic Club in 
downtown Portland. It ran counter to her previous denials in which she said she 
was completely innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no prior knowledge of the planned assault on Nancy Kerrigan. I am 
responsible, however, for failing to report things I learned about the assault 
when I returned home" on Jan. 10 from the U.S. figure skating championships in 
Detroit. Kerrigan was attacked Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the next few days, I learned that some persons that were close to me 
may have been involved in the assault. . . . I have since reported this 
information to the authorities. Although my lawyers tell me that my failure to 
immediately report this information is not a crime, I know I have let you down, 
but I have also let myself down." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding expressed sorrow for what happened to Kerrigan and described herself 
as "embarrassed and ashamed that anyone close to me could be involved." 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of you will be unable to forgive me for that," she said. "It will be 
difficult to forgive myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding gave no accounting of exactly what information she kept secret about 
the attack and neither did she identify those close to her who allegedly were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Harding made her statement, her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, was across town 
at the office of the FBI, undergoing his second day of questioning by 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have had a stormy, seven-year relationship, including a divorce last 
August and a reconciliation that was broken off last week hours before 
Gillooly, 26, became the fourth man arrested and charged with conspiracy to 
commit second-degree assault in the case. The crime is a felony that carries a 
sentence of up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports have been intensifying in the last two days that Harding herself would 
be charged in the case. The (Portland) Oregonian newspaper said a criminal 
complaint was "virtually certain." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper said in its early editions today that Harding initially lied to 
FBI investigators for several hours when questioned last week, saying she knew 
nothing of the plot. But she reportedly changed her story when challenged, 
amended her statements and implicated Gillooly, who was arrested the next day, 
sources told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving false information to the FBI is a crime. An FBI spokesman said he could 
not comment on the Oregonian report. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said it was not a crime in Oregon, as in most states, to know of 
a crime and not report it. But it is unlawful to assist in trying to cover up a 
criminal act. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Figure Skating Assn. said Thursday that it will submit Harding's name 
to the U.S. Olympic Committee as a member of the team that will compete in the 
Feb. 12-27 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway. But, at the same time, the 
USFSA revealed that it has begun the process that could result in her removal 
from the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step in learning Harding's Olympic fate will be next Tuesday when 
the USFSA hearing panel meets in Colorado Springs, Colo. Association rules 
allow Harding 30 days before she must appear at a hearing to respond to the 
panel's recommendations. Because that process might not be completed before the 
end of the Winter Olympics, the USOC could be required to rule on Harding's 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 USOC officials said that Harding's name will be forwarded to the Lillehammer 
Olympic Organizing Committee as a member of the U.S. team before Monday's 
deadline, but the list of entries for the women's figure skating competition 
also will include alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC has until Feb. 21, two days before the women's competition begins, to 
name the two skaters who will participate. The first alternate, because of her 
second-place finish behind Harding in the recent national championships, is 
13-year-old Michelle Kwan of Torrance, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Schiller, executive director of the USOC, said the organization is 
"deeply concerned with statements made . . . by Tonya Harding relative to her 
stated knowledge of the attack on Nancy Kerrigan at the national 
championships." 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States Olympic Committee is prepared under constitutional 
procedures to initiate any action deemed appropriate relative to the conduct of 
any athlete entered in the Games," Schiller said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the USOC's code of conduct, it can take action against any member 
of the U.S. delegation to the Olympics whose behavior does not "bring credit 
and honor to yourself, your teammates, your national governing body, the United 
States Olympic Committee and the United States of America." 
</P>
<P>
 USFSA and USOC officials, who did not want to be identified, said that Harding 
could be found in violation of the USOC's code of conduct as a result of her 
comments Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is what we've been looking for in trying to decide whether she 
belongs on the team," one said. "Even if she is not charged with anything, you 
can certainly argue that she did not behave ethically or according to the 
tenets of good sportsmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan was hit above her right knee the day before the figure skating 
championships and was unable to compete. The FBI has disclosed that it briefly 
investigated whether Kerrigan herself arranged the attack to spare herself from 
competing, but attention soon shifted to Portland when Harding's onetime 
bodyguard began talking to others about his role in arranging the "hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding said her resulting victory in Detroit was "unfulfilling without the 
challenge of skating against Nancy." 
</P>
<P>
 After failing to disclose what she knew, Harding said she subsequently told 
authorities everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still want to represent my country in Lillehammer, Norway, next month," she 
said. "Despite my mistakes and my rough edges, I have done nothing to violate 
the standards of excellence, of sportsmanship that are expected in an Olympic 
athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy Kerrigan and I can show the world two different types of figure 
skating," Harding said. "I look forward to being on the team with her." 
</P>
<P>
 As she described the sequence of events, Harding returned from Detroit 
"exhausted but still focused on the national championships." 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the next few days, I learned that some persons that were close to me 
may have been involved in the assault. My first reaction was one of disbelief, 
and the disbelief was followed by shock and fear." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, Harding continued her daily practice sessions, but spent 
less than a half-hour on the ice. She took one fall that left her holding her 
back in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously arrested in the case were the so-called bodyguard Shawn Eckardt, 
26; suspected hit man Shane Stant, 22, and the suspected getaway driver, 
Derrick Smith, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a sheriff's affidavit, authorities believe Gillooly paid Eckardt 
$3,500 to arrange the attack. Investigators traced Stant's movements first to 
Boston, where Kerrigan practiced for the nationals, and then to Detroit. 
Authorities say Eckardt, Stant and Smith all confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is now before a grand jury, where the arrests must be backed up by an 
indictment. A Feb. 3 deadline faces the grand jury, but that could be extended 
to Feb. 18. 
</P>

CSUN PLANS TO USE PORTABLE BUILDINGS; EDUCATION: TRAILERS WILL BECOME 
CLASSROOMS AND OFFICES. A GRANADA HILLS SCHOOL MAY BE ABANDONED. ANOTHER 
AFTERSHOCK RATTLES STUDENTS AND PARENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The San Fernando Valley's education network took a double hit Thursday when 
Cal State Northridge said it plans to have all class and office work held in 
portable buildings when the students return and Los Angeles Unified School 
District officials said a badly damaged and unstable elementary school in 
Granada Hills might have to be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The news came on the same day that a 4.5-magnitude aftershock centered two 
miles west of Granada Hills sent scores of students out of classrooms and 
reminded everyone in the Valley that it's too early to put the devastating Jan. 
17 Northridge earthquake behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9:19 a.m. temblor rattled children and parents alike. Many schools got 
calls from parents checking to make sure their children and the campuses were 
safe. Some parents returned to schools to retrieve their children. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials, saying they were weary of reinspecting each of the campus' 58 
buildings for safety after the aftershocks, announced that they plan to forgo 
use of all buildings and instead use portable trailers for classes and offices 
when the university reopens to about 22,000 students Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The elementary school in peril is Van Gogh Street Elementary School in Granada 
Hills. School district officials were told Thursday that the ground beneath the 
campus is so unstable and crisscrossed by fissures that the site will probably 
have to be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has an enrollment of 370. Officials said it might be the only 
campus that will have to be entirely shut down because of earthquake damage. In 
all, the Jan. 17 quake caused $700 million in damage to campuses throughout the 
sprawling district. 
</P>
<P>
 In related developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * U. S. Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena released $50 million in 
emergency federal funds to assist in the demolition and reconstruction of 
damaged freeways. It was the largest allocation yet for transportation systems 
crippled by the Jan. 17 earthquake. The money, combined with $45 million made 
available last week, is intended to help state officials continue their freeway 
rebuilding efforts while Congress mulls over a $1.35-billion federal allocation 
for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 * State Controller Gray Davis issued $100 million in checks for government, 
transportation, educational and church agencies in Los Angeles County. Another 
cash infusion was announced by Federal Emergency Management Agency Director 
James Lee Witt, who said checks totaling $27.6 million have been disbursed for 
housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Details began to emerge of the havoc created in the Valley court system by 
the Northridge earthquake. In San Fernando, judges were allowed back into their 
condemned courthouse to retrieve case files and computers. Most of the 
courtrooms will be moved by next week to the Van Nuys courthouse, itself 
damaged in the quake. Two floors there remained closed Thursday, with the other 
five open. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong aftershock was the latest setback to CSUN officials, who are trying 
to reopen a campus that is located near the epicenter of last week's deadly 
6.6-magnitude quake and suffered major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to plan on the basis of no building on the main campus being 
available," CSUN Provost Louanne Kennedy said. "If they come on line, then 
we'll use them, but we can't plan on that. Every time there is an aftershock, 
it changes the status of the buildings and then we have to start all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy advised deans to plan spring and summer semester schedules around the 
use of about 190 trailers, each of which can hold about 25 people and which can 
be linked together to create larger spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 100 trailers will be used for faculty office space, with professors 
likely staggering office hours and sharing desks, she said. The trailers will 
be located on the school's athletic fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Other contingency plans include holding classes in meeting halls located near 
campus, borrowing laboratory space from private corporations, instructing 
education students in local elementary schools and shipping advanced science 
students to facilities at other area colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Other likely adaptations include scheduling more classes during off-peak 
hours, especially Friday nights and Saturdays, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, L. A. Unified school board members were presented with a bleak 
picture of Van Gogh school by Doug Brown, director of school facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 A deep crack snakes its way through the main corridor, and several other 
fissures are visible throughout the wide open campus, he said. Several deep 
cracks have broken classroom and hallway floors. The campus has no water. 
</P>
<P>
 An ominous sign greets visitors at the entrance of Van Gogh Street Elementary 
School: "Parents: Please leave children outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Maureen Diekmann said she is considering relocating the students to 
Frost Middle School in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 At other schools, the day got off to a harrowing start. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Sandra Coffey of Saticoy Elementary School in North Hollywood said 
several parents came to pick up their children after the morning aftershock, 
and many others called to ensure their children's safety. "We're back to 
calming nerves again," Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Osceola Elementary School in Sylmar, one teacher had her students bring 
their favorite stuffed animals to class Thursday. After the temblor, the 
students sat on the floor hugging their toys. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some minor damage at local schools. Ceiling tiles shook lose and 
plaster chips fell. School district officials said there were no reports of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Sid Thompson announced the opening of 14 more San Fernando 
Valley campuses that have been closed since the 6.6 temblor nearly two weeks 
ago. Thirty-three schools, all in the Valley, remain closed, meaning about 
40,000 students have been out of school for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The most severely hit campuses -- two high schools, Kennedy in Granada Hills 
and El Camino Real in Woodland Hills; four middle schools, Northridge, 
Lawrence, San Fernando and Frost; and two elementary schools, San Fernando and 
Van Gogh -- have been dubbed the "Big Eight" by school officials because of the 
severity of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate by Monday morning we can give definitive information on what 
happens at each of these schools," said Thompson. "We realize you want your 
young people back. We will bring them back when it is safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Options include installing portable classrooms in safe areas, finding 
alternative space in commercial and other buildings or transferring students. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials also announced that every school in the district has been 
given $5 per student to spend on emergency quake-related counseling, health 
care or the purchase of school supplies. Hard-hit campuses received $15 a 
student, aid provided by the U. S. Department of Education.

CLAUDE AKINS, TOUGH GUY OF TV AND FILMS, DIES AT 75; CELEBRITIES: ACTOR STARRED 
IN SERIES 'MOVIN' ON,' 'LOBO.' HE CALLED HIMSELF HOLLYWOOD'S HIGHEST-PAID 
UNKNOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Claude Akins, the rugged actor with a Dixie drawl who was best known for his 
television roles as a truck driver, a colorful rural sheriff and a pitchman for 
a chain of automobile transmission repair shops, died of cancer Thursday 
afternoon at his home in Altadena. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian Myers, Akins' publicist, said the actor had been seriously ill for 
about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he appeared, mostly in supporting roles, in more than 50 movies and 
400 television shows, the burly, weather-beaten part-Cherokee from Nelson, Ga., 
considered himself "the highest-paid unknown" in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like an outsider in a business I have been a part of for 37 years," he 
told an interviewer in 1987. "For some reason, Hollywood's mainstream has 
eluded me. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "A guy who looks like Robert Redford will most often be cast as a hero. A guy 
like me or Ernie Borgnine plays a lot of heavies. If you're big, they think 
you're tough. And if you're tough, they think you're dumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Dumb he wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Northwestern University who was trained in Shakespeare, Akins 
moved to Broadway in the late 1940s, where he had a part in the hit play "The 
Rose Tattoo." 
</P>
<P>
 His success on Broadway led him to Hollywood in 1953 and a role in the Academy 
Award-winning film, "From Here to Eternity." More hit films were quick to 
follow -- "The Caine Mutiny" in 1954, "The Defiant Ones" in 1958, "Inherit the 
Wind" in 1960, "How the West Was Won" in 1962 and "The Killers" in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1970s, he was co-starring with Frank Converse in "Movin' On," a 
television series about a pair of gypsy truck drivers who plied the nation's 
highways. The show was a success, numbering then-President Gerald R. Ford among 
its fans. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Movin' On," Akins played the title character in "Lobo," a series about 
a sheriff. His other television credits included "Cannon," "Police Story," 
"McCloud," "Mannix" and "The Streets of San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, acting is acting, whether it's for the movies, TV or the stage," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, as the roles became less frequent, Akins did radio and 
television commercials for a variety of products, including Polygrip, AM/PM 
Mini-Market and perhaps most familiarly, Aamco, the transmission repair chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Akins leaves his wife of 42 years, Theresa; a son, Claude Jr., and two 
daughters, Wendy and Michelle. 
</P>
<P>
 A funeral Mass is scheduled Saturday at St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church in 
Altadena.

WILSON RENEWS SMOG CHECK LAW; POLLUTION: IF A COMPROMISE WITH THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT IS REACHED BEFORE THE LEGISLATION TAKES EFFECT NEXT YEAR, THE 
OVERHAULED RULES COULD SUPERSEDE IT. 
</P>

 Rejecting Clinton Administration arguments, Gov. Pete Wilson on Thursday 
signed legislation aimed at cleaning up the air by overhauling the state's 
automobile smog checking program. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's action occurred even as progress was reported in renewed negotiations 
between state and federal representatives over how best to get California into 
compliance with federal clean-air laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The new California law will not take effect until next year, giving federal 
and state officials ample time to reach an accord. If a settlement is reached, 
the accord could be swiftly enacted and supersede the law Wilson signed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law preserves the current system authorizing 9,000 local garages and 
service stations to both test vehicle emissions and make repairs, a double role 
that critics contend encourages fraud. It also authorizes random roadside 
testing, imposes stiffer penalties for fraud, requires smog technicians to be 
better trained and bans the worst polluters from the roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Environmental Protection Agency officials contend that the bill is 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who endorsed the bill as a "common sense" way to cleanse the air 
without further jeopardizing the economy, signed the measure in his office 
without the public ceremony that usually accompanies high-profile issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the Republican governor insisted that the bill will meet 
federal standards but said he is willing to continue negotiating to "improve 
upon the framework we have established in this legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, EPA spokeswoman Denise Graveline said the bill does not bring 
California into compliance but added that officials "look forward to working 
out additional modifications so Californians can have a Smog Check program that 
makes both economical and environmental sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators for both sides said progress toward a compromise was being made 
and that talks will resume on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, federal EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner urged Wilson 
to veto the bill. She said the legislation would go only halfway toward meeting 
federal exhaust emission reduction standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal EPA officials have warned that unless the Smog Check program is 
reformed, additional controls on industrial sources of air pollution will occur 
automatically in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Washington had threatened sanctions sooner. But one week after the 
Northridge earthquake, Browner canceled discretionary sanctions that would have 
cost California about $800 million in highway funds this spring. She took the 
action as President Clinton was promising massive federal aid to help Southern 
California recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Wilson agreed to resume the talks, the first round of which occurred 
Wednesday in Sacramento. The governor imposed a deadline of Thursday for 
reaching a solution, but it went unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who has sued the state and federal 
governments for immediate enforcement of the Clean Air Act, accused Wilson of 
using the smog issue to help him win reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's consistent with the governor's apparent stratagem to blame Washington 
for all the state's woes -- immigration, smog and now the earthquake," Hayden 
said. "He's going to with his hand out to Bill Clinton (for immigration and 
earthquake relief) and attacking federal bureaucrats at the same time. He wants 
it both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's Graveline said a centralized network of facilities that would only 
test vehicles -- not repair them -- was now considered merely one option on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 She said acceptable alternatives could include routing newer cars to garages 
for both testing and repair, if necessary. Other cars would go to test-only 
stations, be repaired elsewhere and return for a second test.

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / JAMES BORNEMEIER: AID PLAN TOUCHES OFF BUDGETARY 
DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When swollen rivers were ravaging the Midwest last summer, most House 
Republicans joined with 45 conservative Democrats to block -- momentarily -- a 
$3-billion flood relief bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans wanted to make the point that laying out billions of dollars 
in federal assistance without offsetting budget cuts was bad, deficit-enhancing 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, Rep. Jim Nussle, a two-term Republican deficit hawk from 
rain-soaked Iowa, was one of the leaders of that uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 In a show of party unity, California's House Republicans voted in a bloc to 
support the Nussle movement, sending a signal that fiscal discipline can be 
applied in the most dire emergency situations. 
</P>
<P>
 (The House leadership, embarrassed by the unusual procedural defeat, regrouped 
and the aid package was approved on an overwhelming vote.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That was then. This is now, and Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon, whose district 
encompasses the Northridge quake's epicenter, has a different point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to vote for the aid with offsets, or without offsets," said McKeon, 
ordinarily an ardent foe of virtually all congressional spending measures. 
"Some members will try to raise the offset issue. . . . I hope that will not 
delay (the vote). Getting the money is the top priority." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nussle is still at it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the day that the emergency aid package was introduced by three 
dozen California members, Nussle wrote to Rep. William H. Natcher, the chairman 
of the House Appropriations Committee: "There is no question that the 
Appropriations Committee must act quickly in drafting legislation providing 
assistance to the earthquake victims in California. While this legislation 
should be considered expeditiously, we do not believe sound budgetary 
principles need to be compromised to accomplish this task." 
</P>
<P>
 This sort of talk is as welcome as a swarm of aftershocks to California 
legislators, particularly to Republicans who have to juggle their positions.  
</P>
<P>
 But as Redlands Republican Jerry Lewis so refreshingly confessed earlier this 
week: "Consistency is not required in this process. Those who would suggest 
that perhaps we should balance the budget on the backs of the people who face 
this crisis in Los Angeles are missing a definition of emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one sees the $6.6-billion aid package in any danger, the 
Californians are taking no chances. Congressional sources say that the aid bill 
will be wired as tightly as House procedures allow. The House leadership wants 
the bill on President Clinton's desk by Feb. 12 and will probably get it there 
on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Californians, there may be some defections. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach) has already threatened to vote against the package if his 
amendment to bar federal aid going to illegal immigrants (he dubs it the 
government's "no-ask, no-tell" policy) is disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some conservative Democrats, like Cal Dooley of Visalia, intend to vote 
against a plan that prohibits discussion of the offset issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, Democrats also wish Gov. Pete Wilson would act a just little 
more gracious about the swift Clinton Administration response. His reluctance 
to be specific about state relief efforts, until he sizes up damage estimates 
and incoming federal money, sends the wrong signal to Washington, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear to me that the size of this disaster is so enormous that the 
state is going to have to do everything within its powers to meet emergency 
needs and structural building needs," says Sen. Dianne Feinstein. "To say 'we 
will hold back, we won't do anything and we will wait until the feds come 
through' is something I hope I do not hear because that would not be positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: California wins no popularity contests on Capitol Hill; please 
appear pleased and cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fiscal conservatives such as Nussle and Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Oceanside) are left to ponder a long-term solution to disaster aid.  
</P>
<P>
 Nussle tends toward the simple but politically difficult pay-as-you-go route. 
Others favor some kind of disaster fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster fund idea worries Packard. "We don't have the ability as an 
institution to keep our hands out of any pot of money that's out there. Unless 
we built such a fund so that we had no legal access to it under any 
circumstances, I'd have a problem with it." 
</P>
<P>
 So California will get its aid, and the debate will fire up again when the 
next calamity strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This particular disaster ought not to bear the brunt of a new policy," 
Packard says. "I like the concept, but let's get through this one."LEGISLATORS

WORLD PERSPECTIVE / EUROPE; POPULARITY OF FRENCH PREMIER DEFIES THE ODDS; 
EDOUARD BALLADUR HAS WEATHERED ENOUGH CRISES TO SINK MANY A LEADER. BUT HIS 
RATINGS JUST KEEP RISING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Take your pick of metaphors. Maybe he is, as one analyst suggests, the 
inoxydable , or stainless steel, prime minister. Or perhaps he is, as another 
sees him, more of a buvard , an industrial-strength sponge that "absorbs 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Call him what they will, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has in just 10 
months on the job suffered enough political crises to sink many a leader. And 
he has not just survived, but flourished, becoming the runaway favorite to 
succeed President Francois Mitterrand in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody predicted Balladur would ever be this popular," said Alain Duhamel, a 
French political analyst. "But he corresponds well to the political equilibrium 
in France these days. The French wanted change. They wanted a certain 
respectability. And they were fed up with politicians offering ready-made 
solutions that didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur, 64, has had one bona fide success in the eyes of the electorate: He 
took a tough line with American negotiators in talks leading to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, exacting concessions on agriculture and 
entertainment that were hailed here as a great victory for France. 
</P>
<P>
 But there has been no shortage of threats to his popularity, including the 
continuing 12% jobless rate, recession, strikes and diplomatic miscues. 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur's plan to cut jobs at the ailing state-run airline, Air France, 
touched off an ugly strike last fall, forcing him to capitulate to strikers. 
Then, to general dismay, he sent two alleged Iranian terrorists, wanted by 
Switzerland, back to safe harbor in Iran -- and refused to explain why, except 
to cite vague concerns of "national security." 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, Balladur and three government ministers went to Saudi Arabia 
promising to sign big arms deals for French companies, only to leave 
empty-handed and embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 And, when he tried to sneak in a new law increasing private school funding a 
few weeks ago, a legislative court annulled the law and 600,000 people still 
took to the streets of Paris in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 So how is Balladur doing after all that? Just fine, the French say. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent opinion polls give him a 60% positive rating, a tally that has been 
increasing steadily. Among all the potential candidates for French presidential 
elections in 1995, Balladur has the support of about 60% of the electorate, the 
polls indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, nearly two-thirds of the French believe they are being 
poorly governed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even Balladur admits to being baffled by the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is paradoxical that the French have evidently still a good opinion of me, 
and yet apparently believe they are badly governed," he told the Financial 
Times of London, which anointed him its "Man of the Year."  
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, Balladur became the prime minister last March because he didn't 
have presidential ambitions. He was part of the conservative coalition that won 
484 of 577 seats in the National Assembly last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the political pillars of the right, fellow Gaullist Jacques Chirac and the 
centrist former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, didn't want the job. They 
feared their own presidential aspirations would be bruised in a two-year 
"cohabitation" with Mitterrand, the Socialist president.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the French system, the president is elected for a seven-year term and 
enjoys wide powers as chief of state. But the prime minister is responsible for 
forming a government and directing domestic policy. On occasion, that system 
has resulted in battles between a president and prime minister from opposite 
ends of the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 But this cohabitation has gone well, further polishing Balladur's reputation 
as a courteous, honest man who stands above the political fray.  
</P>
<P>
 Will his popularity last? Much will depend on his ability to treat the ailing 
economy and carry out his ambitious plans to privatize two dozen state-owned 
industries. But few analysts are willing to bet against the man in the Savile 
Row suits who already has defied the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to last," Duhamel said. "But it is going to be tested. The 
big question is whether he will be able to give the kind of dynamic economic 
leadership that the French are waiting for."

IN JAPAN, IT'S SHOWDOWN TIME ON REFORM; GOVERNMENT: PREMIER HOSOKAWA WILL TRY 
TO WORK OUT AN 11TH-HOUR COMPROMISE WITH THE OPPOSITION. FAILING THAT, HE MAY 
STEP ASIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring that he has no intention of clinging to power, Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa today prepared for a final showdown with legislators 
over enactment of promised political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition leaders announced late Thursday that Hosokawa will try to work out 
an eleventh-hour compromise with the president of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party, Yohei Kono. But if Kono rejects a meeting or fails to agree 
to a new reform plan, they said, Hosokawa will put his coalition's package to a 
final vote in the lower house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-thirds vote there -- considered highly unlikely -- would be needed to 
overturn the upper house rejection of the bills last week. The lower house 
approved the bills last Nov. 18 but with the support of only 53% of its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I cannot deliver on my promise of political reform," Hosokawa said 
Thursday, "I have no intention whatsoever of clinging to the prime minister's 
post." 
</P>
<P>
 When Hosokawa took office last August, he promised to "assume responsibility" 
if he failed to enact the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa made his announcement at a political rally in a hotel, where he took 
the unusual step of urging voters to "call your representatives" to appeal for 
support of the bills, which would change the way the powerful lower house of 
Parliament is elected and would ban corporate donations to individual 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "After five years of repeatedly debating political reform, if we now bury it 
because of only minor differences of opinion, the opportunity to carry out 
reform will never again come," Hosokawa warned. Although both sides agreed to 
scrap the system of multi-seat constituencies in favor of single-seat 
districts, they remained deadlocked over the extent to which controls should be 
tightened on political funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without political reform, we cannot hope that economic stimulus measures 
could succeed," Hosokawa told the rally. "Without political reform, it will be 
impossible to realize administrative or (budgetary) reform, or reform and 
opening of our economy and society. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people's loss of confidence in party and parliamentary politics will 
become decisive, and it is perfectly clear that Japan will lose completely the 
trust of the international community," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks about not clinging to his post echoed comments made Tuesday by 
Shusei Tanaka, his chief personal adviser, who predicted that the prime 
minister's resignation over failure of the bills is "highly possible." 
</P>
<P>
 If he does resign, he will become the third prime minister in three years to 
do so after failing to change Japan's scandal-ridden political system. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before midnight, a joint committee of the upper and lower houses gave 
up efforts to hammer out a compromise reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's coalition of seven lower house parties holds only 260 seats in the 
511-member chamber and would need a rebellion by 81 Liberal Democrats to win 
the necessary two-thirds approval. Even if the bills fail, the vote could 
precipitate another major split in the Liberal Democratic Party, which lost its 
38-year grasp on power after about 50 reformers bolted the party last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a new parliamentary session will begin Monday, the bills cannot be 
carried over -- and speculation is rampant about what Hosokawa might do if 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 He could do nothing, or resign without calling a general election. He could 
call a general election in February. Or he could postpone a resignation and 
general election until after he announces a package of measures to stimulate 
Japan's limp economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic measures have been shunted aside for more than a month by the 
political turmoil. Also up in the air is a scheduled summit meeting between 
Hosokawa and President Clinton at the White House on Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 And another political upheaval is rearing its head: Police and prosecutors 
have leaked to Japanese reporters plans to arrest Parliament members for taking 
bribes from construction companies in a scandal that already has snared more 
than 30 governors, mayors and construction company executives.

NO AID WITHOUT REFORMS, U.S. WARNS RUSSIA, BELARUS; DIPLOMACY: WHITE HOUSE 
SCRAMBLES TO ASSESS DAMAGE AFTER DEMOCRACY PROPONENTS ARE OUSTED. 
</P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration, thrown for two successive losses after economic 
reformers were ousted in Russia and neighboring Belarus, warned the two 
governments Thursday that most of their Western economic aid will dry up if 
they stop moving toward capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
said he was "disturbed" by the resignation of Boris G. Fyodorov, Russia's 
reformist finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen warned that Western countries will insist that Moscow bring inflation 
under control and move forward with economic reforms before they deliver 
billions of dollars in promised aid. "Unless they see that, they're not going 
to implement the kind of funding that Russia needs to make this transition, and 
the support is going to be measured with the pace of reform," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said the Clinton Administration already is directing its $2.5 
billion in direct American aid this year toward local reformers and away from 
the central government to make the aid effective even if Moscow moves away from 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the State Department issued an unusual statement decrying 
the Belarus Parliament's action in voting that country's reformist leader, 
Stanislav Shushkevich, out of office. "The United States believes that vote 
deprives Belarus of leadership that has made a remarkable contribution to peace 
and stability in Europe," State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 On both fronts, the Administration was visibly scrambling to assess the damage 
to its policy of all-out support for reformers and to see what can be salvaged 
amid the setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one senior official: "The questions we are struggling with are: How bad 
is it going to be? How long will it take for the Russians to recognize their 
mistakes? And what can we do to help?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For most of his first year in office, U.S. support for Russia was the one 
foreign policy triumph that President Clinton could point to with unalloyed 
pride. It was a success story, he argued, that outweighed any setbacks on the 
smaller battlefields of Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two weeks ago, Clinton traveled to Russia and Belarus and delivered 
public endorsements of Shushkevich, Fyodorov and Russian Deputy Prime Minister 
Yegor T. Gaidar. All three promptly lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's response to their ouster has been what one senior 
official described as "a wince," followed by pointed warnings to the new 
governments -- plus assurances that the United States will not walk away from 
its commitment to help reform, even if that reform slows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is that the United States not get rattled by events, 
that we don't panic and shift course," a White House official said. "If we have 
to modify that course, we will. But as long as the trajectory is upward, we 
will support reforms." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has issued public and private warnings to Russia focusing 
on the problem of inflation. The last, reformist government waged an epic 
battle to hold inflation below 20% a month, largely by limiting the easy credit 
it had previously supplied to inefficient, state-owned industries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new government has proclaimed a policy of supporting those industries 
and seeking to control inflation through price controls -- an approach most 
Western economists consider unworkable. "A successful program to raise living 
standards in Russia . . . has to address inflation," Bentsen said Thursday. 
"There's no way to address inflation without controlling credit growth. That's 
an absolute imperative." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to such public statements, Vice President Al Gore pressed that 
point privately in two telephone calls with Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. 
Chernomyrdin, with whom he has worked closely on space and energy projects, a 
senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Russians grapple with their economic policy problems, the 
Administration is offering them continued aid on two distinct tracks, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One kind of aid -- the "big bucks" from the International Monetary Fund and 
similar institutions -- will depend directly on the Moscow government's 
economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The other, the smaller fund of American direct aid, will go to individual 
projects that further the cause of reform. That kind of aid should not be 
directly affected by Moscow's policy shifts, officials said.

 The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly Thursday to urge the Clinton 
Administration to end the U.S. arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-binding resolution also said the United States should provide 
"appropriate military assistance" if requested by the Muslim government. The 
vote was 87-9. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote came after calls for an end to the embargo for the sake of "human 
decency" and after criticism of "inaction and paralysis" by the world 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council imposed the arms embargo against the splintering 
Yugoslav federation two years ago.

 The troubled U.N. mission in the former Yugoslav republics disclosed Thursday 
that it has dismissed 23 soldiers and seven civilians for corruption following 
an investigation into allegations of widespread criminal activity in its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Austrian Gen. Guenther Greindl, who conducted the internal probe of one of 
the largest and most expensive U.N. peacekeeping forces in history, brushed off 
the most serious accusations as unfounded or lacking enough evidence to 
prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
 Greindl's probe was ordered by former U.N. Protection Force chief Thorvald 
Stoltenberg after media reports last fall, both in former Yugoslav republics 
and in Western newspapers, detailed instances of misconduct by U.N. soldiers. 
The alleged misconduct ranged from black-market sales of pilfered gasoline to 
patronizing a Serb-run brothel near Sarajevo where Muslim women were imprisoned 
as sex slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Greindl said the inquiry confirmed his impression that "there were a few black 
sheep in the herd." But he and Stoltenberg's newly appointed replacement as 
civilian chief of the U.N. mission, Yasushi Akashi of Japan, insisted the 
abuses were neither widespread nor systematic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think that the ratio of illegal acts we've witnessed here is out of 
proportion to what might take place in a U.N. peacekeeping operation," Akashi 
told a news conference called to discuss the report that was delivered to U.N. 
headquarters in New York nearly two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having said that," he added, "even small, isolated instances or acts are 
regrettable." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Greindl nor Akashi shed much light on the more serious reports of 
misconduct by U.N. troops, including accusations of gunrunning for various 
combatants, drug trafficking by U.N. personnel, sale of pilfered humanitarian 
aid to hungry civilians and the delivery of food to certain armed factions with 
the aim of strengthening their position in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "While there were cases of impropriety, there were only a limited number of 
cases in which illegality was firmly established," Akashi said. "Personnel who 
were found to have acted improperly have been reprimanded. In those cases where 
the evidence suggested illegality, personnel have either been repatriated or 
dismissed from their jobs with the United Nations." 
</P>
<P>
 Greindl said 23 soldiers had been dismissed from the force as a consequence of 
the investigation -- 19 Ukrainians and four from Kenya's contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the U.N. officials said the infractions they could prove were all 
committed by individuals, some national contingents have been suspected of 
abusing their role in the humanitarian effort in order to make money out of the 
Balkan misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia and Ukraine have been among the most eager participants in the Balkans 
mission, as both former Soviet republics are burdened with too many soldiers in 
the post-Cold War era and too little money to support them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Greindl's report made no mention of the former Russian commander of 
U.N.-patrolled "sector east" in Croatia. Alexander Khromchenkov, who served 12 
months as one of the United Nations' most senior officers in the Balkans force, 
has been seen driving around the Serb-held territory in a white Mercedes 
reportedly given to him by Serbian gunmen who have employed him as a 
"consultant" since he completed his peacekeeping tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Greindl said parts of his investigation were continuing, including inquiries 
into claims by Bosnian government officials that Canadian and other U.N. 
officers based in Sarajevo frequented a Serb-run nightspot called Sonja's Kon 
Tiki, where captive Muslim women were forced into prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Greindl estimated that the investigation will be concluded by the end of 
February or early March.

EGYPT FUNDAMENTALISTS' SUIT TO FORCE A DIVORCE DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A court ruled Thursday that an Egyptian professor does not have to divorce his 
wife even though Muslim fundamentalists think he should. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Muslim fundamentalist lawyers filed suit to try to force the divorce, 
claiming Nasr Hamid abu Zaid's writings as a professor of Arabic literature 
make him a heretic who could not remain married to a Muslim woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Abu Zaid and his wife, a professor of French, opposed the suit. They said they 
are in love and want to remain married. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Mohammed Ahmed Awadallah, a civil affairs court judge, turned 
down the suit on grounds that the plaintiffs had no direct interest in the 
case. His legal opinion explaining the verdict is to be released in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian intellectuals, already deeply concerned about fundamentalists' 
threats, had watched the case closely. Secularists compared it to the 1992 
killing of Egyptian writer Farag Foda, an outspoken critic of fundamentalist 
pressure for an Islamic state.

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, 8 POLITICAL PARTIES SIGN REFORM PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mexican government and eight political parties signed an agreement 
Thursday calling for sweeping and unprecedented electoral reforms in an attempt 
to end a peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement took a giant step toward meeting one of the central demands of 
the Zapatista National Liberation Army, which launched a New Year's Day 
insurgency calling for indigenous rights and political empowerment through 
clean and just elections. 
</P>
<P>
 It also held out the prospect of loosening the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party's grip on Mexican politics. The party has dominated the 
government for 64 years, often through the use of electoral fraud. The 
agreement calls for, among other things, independent electoral authorities, an 
end to the use of government funds by any political party and a prosecutor to 
pursue those accused of electoral fraud. It also calls for fair treatment of 
all parties in the Mexican media, which traditionally have given most of their 
coverage to ruling-party candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Minister Jorge Carpizo MacGregor, announcing the agreement, said 
special sessions of the Mexican Congress will be called if necessary to change 
laws to codify the reforms.

U.S. EXPECTED TO CALL FOR AIRTIGHT HAITI EMBARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, joined by France, Canada and Venezuela, is 
expected to urge the U.N. Security Council early next week to impose an almost 
airtight ban on trade with Haiti, substantially toughening a petroleum embargo 
that already has shredded the nation's economy, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the United States and its three allies have concluded that the 
additional sanctions are needed to force the Haitian military to permit ousted 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to regain the office he lost in a bloody 1991 
coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the four nations, collectively known as the "Four Friends of the U.N. 
Secretary-General Regarding Haiti," threatened additional sanctions more than a 
month ago, they have been reluctant to take the step because of the devastating 
effect the trade embargo is sure to have on the country's poorest citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives of the Four Friends, meeting in Washington, decided late 
Wednesday that the additional measures are required to coerce the Haitian 
military and its commander, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, to stand aside and allow 
Aristide, the country's only democratically elected chief executive, to regain 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control froze 
the U.S. bank accounts and other assets of all Haitian military officers. The 
names of 523 officers were added to a list of 41 individuals whose assets were 
frozen last October. But Treasury officials said the sanctions apply to all 
officers, whether or not they are included on the new list. 
</P>
<P>
 In another step aimed directly at the military, the U.S. Embassy in the 
Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, announced Wednesday that the U.S. government 
has revoked the entry visas of all Haitian army officers. 
</P>
<P>
 A State Department official said that the decision on new sanctions by 
representatives of the Four Friends must be ratified at the top levels of all 
four governments, a process expected to take several days. The official said 
that if all goes as planned, the four countries will ask the Security Council 
early next week to ban all commercial trade with Haiti -- both exports and 
imports -- and to prohibit non-commercial airplane flights between the 
beleaguered country and the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the plan would add the weight of the Security Council to a trade 
embargo imposed by the Organization of American States only days after the 
September, 1991, coup. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping OAS embargo proved to be largely ineffective because it covered 
only countries of the Western Hemisphere and contained no enforcement 
provisions. In contrast, a binding resolution of the Security Council would 
include all nations and would be far more difficult to evade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council banned trade in petroleum and arms last November after 
Cedras and his supporters failed to keep an agreement, signed in July on 
Governors Island in New York harbor, to restore Aristide to office by Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few leaks have occurred in the oil and weapons embargo, the 
sanctions have devastated the Haitian economy. Even the military and its 
affluent supporters -- generally immune to the rigors of the Caribbean nation's 
poverty -- have felt the impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, U.S. officials conceded that the country's poor have been the 
hardest hit. Although the embargo excepts food and medicine, private relief 
organizations have had to curtail their efforts because of the fuel shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-based CARE International had to halt food deliveries for a month until it 
received fuel earlier this month from a special humanitarian shipment, the 
Associated Press reported from Port-au-Prince. The number of Haitians who got 
their main daily meal from CARE -- up to 580,000 last year -- has plunged to 
117,000, said Chris Conrad, CARE's country director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have very, very limited options right now," said Conrad, adding that some 
shipments resumed Wednesday. "The more the crisis continues, the more limited 
our options are." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that a general embargo, although potentially more 
devastating in the short run, will increase the pressure on the military and 
should hasten the return of democracy.

ROLLINS HIRED BY BLACK GOP SENATE HOPEFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward J. Rollins, who created a furor by claiming he schemed to suppress the 
turnout of black voters in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, has agreed to 
run a black businessman's Senate campaign in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Watkins said Thursday he wanted to hire Rollins despite the controversy 
because "Ed has a great political background and knows how to win races, and I 
wanted him on my team." 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins, 40, is a Philadelphia business consultant and a Baptist minister. He 
said he will announce his candidacy next week for the Republican nomination for 
the seat now held by Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins worked for then-Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle and later worked in the George 
Bush White House as associate director of public liaison. He said he approached 
Rollins about a month ago and asked him to run the campaign. He said Rollins 
agreed and insisted on not being paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he made a mistake, he said he was sorry, he said he was wrong, he 
asked to be forgiven, and I forgave him," Watkins said of his decision to hire 
Rollins. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins, a veteran GOP political consultant who ran Ronald Reagan's 1984 
reelection campaign, was out of the country and unavailable for comment. But an 
associate confirmed that Rollins had agreed to advise Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins was the lead consultant in New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's 
campaign. A week after she defeated Democratic incumbent James J. Florio, 
Rollins told reporters that a major factor in her victory was the use of 
$500,000 in "walking around money" to pay campaign workers and ministers to 
suppress the black vote in Democratic areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins quickly recanted and said he fabricated the story, but state and 
federal agencies launched investigations of potential voting law violations. On 
Jan. 12, a week before Whitman's inauguration, authorities said they had found 
no evidence that Republicans paid anyone to hold down the Democratic vote.

 The U.S. attorney's office entertains callers on hold with a little mood 
music: the themes from "Perry Mason," "Dragnet" and "Hawaii Five-O." 
</P>
<P>
 "Members of the judiciary and myself complained about being put on hold and 
being subjected to the same elevator music over and over again," U.S. Atty. 
Steve Rapp said. "We thought we'd have some variety."

 So now, while waiting to talk to someone about an upcoming trial or to report 
a crime, callers hear the themes from the popular crime shows.

NORTH LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN FOR SENATE SEAT; POLITICS: IRAN-CONTRA FIGURE TELLS 
VIRGINIA SUPPORTERS THAT HE WANTS 'TO TAKE BACK GOVERNMENT FROM THE INSIDERS.' 
HE HAS $1-MILLION WAR CHEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oliver L. North, the retired Marine officer who became a national figure 
during the Iran-Contra scandal, launched his campaign for the U.S. Senate on 
Thursday with public appearances across Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to supporters at hotel rallies in four cities, the man who admitted 
lying to members of Congress seven years ago said he wants to join their ranks 
"to take back government from the insiders and wheeler-dealers and put it back 
where it belongs -- in your hands." 
</P>
<P>
 If North wins the Republican nomination at the party's state convention in 
June, the former lieutenant colonel who ran a secret White House resupply 
mission for Nicaragua's Contras likely will face another former Marine -- 
incumbent Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb -- next November. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks here in Virginia's heartland that mirrored earlier speeches in 
Norfolk, Richmond and later in Herndon, North said: "I believe that we, those 
of us gathered in this room, represent the real hopes and the real aspirations 
and dreams and values of the working men and women. I believe that if we have 
the courage and determination to do right by them, we can make a change in 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 In each hotel ballroom, his supporters cheered and waved blue-and-white signs 
that said: "North for U.S. Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thursday marked North's first official campaigning, the former 
National Security Council aide in the Ronald Reagan White House has been giving 
political speeches around the state for the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 He has already raised a campaign war chest in excess of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted in 1989 of three felonies in connection with the scandal -- 
including aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress -- North acknowledged 
that he hid the truth from congressional investigators who first questioned him 
in 1986 about reports that he was secretly assisting the Nicaraguan rebel 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, U.S. military aid for the Contras was prohibited by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 North's conviction was overturned in 1991 by a federal appellate court on 
grounds that his testimony to Congress, which came after a grant of immunity, 
had been used against him indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the final report by Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent 
counsel appointed to investigate the scandal, agreed with North that higher 
officials of the Reagan Administration had directed the unlawful activities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walsh insisted that North still had lied during early congressional 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political analysts have said they believe that North's record in the 
Iran-Contra scandal leaves him open to public criticism. If so, the immediate 
beneficiary would be former Reagan Budget Director James C. Miller III, who 
kicked off his own campaign for the Republican nomination last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry J. Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, noted 
that "North has many enemies," which he said often occurs with people who 
engender strong emotion in others. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is only the beginning of a very long campaign," Sabato said.

SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH PLAN TOUTED AS BEST AROUND; INSURANCE: MCDERMOTT, WELLSTONE 
SAY THEIR PROPOSAL OFFERS BETTER BENEFITS THAN CLINTON'S. TAXES WOULD PAY FOR 
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Democratic authors of a Canadian-style health plan said Thursday that they 
could pay for health care for all Americans -- and offer more generous benefits 
than President Clinton has proposed -- through an 8.4% payroll tax on 
corporations and a 2.1% tax on individuals' earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President's bill and ours are the only viable options" because they offer 
health coverage to every American, Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, known as a single-payer plan, would eliminate private health 
insurance. Instead, the money now paid in premiums by employers and workers 
would be collected in taxes by the federal government and distributed among the 
states. Each state would decide on the best way to deliver health services 
within its borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Every citizen would receive a plastic card that could be used to pay bills at 
hospitals, doctor's offices, nursing homes or pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach -- making the federal government the collector and distributor 
of all health dollars -- was rejected by Clinton during last year's campaign. 
At that time, his advisers viewed it as politically suicidal, believing that 
opponents would attack the plan as a huge federal tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-payer plan was proposed by McDermott and Sen. Paul Wellstone 
(D-Minn.) and has 92 liberal sponsors in the House and five in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although it seems to have scant chance of enactment by Congress, its 
supporters have an important block of votes that the President must capture to 
get a health reform bill approved this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Its estimated $1.3-trillion price tag over three years would be paid by 
raising $1.2 trillion in taxes on businesses and individuals over the period. 
Another $59 billion would be generated by increasing the federal cigarette tax 
to $2 a pack from the current level of 24 cents and $1 billion would come from 
a new 50% excise tax on the sale of handguns and ammunition. There now is a 10% 
tax on the sales price of pistols and revolvers, and an 11% tax on ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan, in contrast, would expand on the current system, in which most 
Americans are insured through the workplace. It would require all companies to 
offer insurance, with firms expected to pay 80% of the cost and workers the 
remaining 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Both plans offer a comprehensive package of benefits. But the 
McDermott-Wellstone legislation promises more: full coverage of nursing home 
costs and prescription drugs, and no additional charges for visiting doctors or 
hospitals. Under the Clinton plan, a family could spend as much as $3,000 in 
out-of-pocket medical costs annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Wellstone said that his proposal "has a tremendous amount of common ground 
with" the Administration blueprint for health care reform. He and McDermott 
praised the President for making health care reform the top domestic issue and 
promised a close working alliance with the White House to develop a final 
legislative package. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the single-payer bill could 
save as much as $100 billion a year from the nation's current health tab of 
more than $900 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The McDermott-Wellstone plan would apply an 8.4% payroll tax to firms with 
more than 75 workers. At smaller companies, the tax would be 4% a year. 
Individuals would pay 2.1% of their taxable income.

GUNS MAY PASS CARS IN CAUSING DEATH BY INJURY; VIOLENCE: SHOOTING FATALITIES 
ROSE 60% FROM 1968 TO 1991, A FEDERAL STUDY FINDS. AUTO DEATHS DECREASED 21% 
BUT REMAIN THE LEADING CATEGORY.

 Deaths from firearms are soaring at an extraordinary rate, U.S. health 
officials said Thursday, and guns will replace traffic accidents as the 
nation's No. 1 cause of death by injury within the next 10 years if the trend 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1968 to 1991 shooting deaths increased 60% nationwide, while 
automobile-related deaths decreased 21%, largely as a result of efforts to curb 
traffic accidents and make vehicles safer, according to a report by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Automobile accidents still remained the leading cause of injury-related deaths 
across the nation in 1991, however, with 43,536 fatalities compared to 38,317 
shooting deaths, the CDC said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency called on government officials to take steps to reduce firearm 
injuries by enacting tougher gun-control laws, encouraging the use of safety 
devices on weapons and promoting educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is appalling that in the world's strongest and wealthiest country, death 
by firearms is increasing at the alarming rate these studies find," Health and 
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The report coincides with Clinton Administration efforts to enact tough 
gun-control legislation. The Administration already has succeeded in winning 
passage of the so-called Brady bill, which requires a waiting period for 
would-be handgun purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
 But while that effort was applauded, James Mercy, acting director of the CDC's 
division for violence prevention, said: "I don't think any one particular type 
of intervention is going to solve the problem. . . . It would be unrealistic to 
suggest that the Brady bill by itself will substantially decrease the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The report said that firearm deaths already had surpassed traffic accident 
fatalities in 1991 as the leading cause of injury-related deaths in the 
District of Columbia and six states: California, New York, Texas, Louisiana, 
Nevada and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years from 1988 to 1991, shootings were the leading cause of 
injury-related deaths for people ages 25 to 34, while firearm-related deaths 
remained second to traffic fatalities for people 15 to 24. In that category, 
however, gun-related deaths rose by 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 CDC officials predicted that, if the rate of increase from 1968 to 1991 
continues, the number of firearm-related deaths will overtake automobile 
accidents by the year 2003. If the rate follows the pattern of the last three 
years of the study, however, gun-related deaths will become the leading cause 
of injury-related deaths by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Black males are more than three times as likely to die in shootings than white 
males, the report said, while people 15 to 24 are in the most susceptible age 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 In California in 1990, automobile-related deaths outpaced deaths from firearms 
by 11%. But in 1991, firearm deaths were 1% higher than traffic deaths.

3RD TRIAL OF BECKWITH FOR EVERS SLAYING OPENS; JUSTICE: PROCEEDINGS FOR 
73-YEAR-OLD MISSISSIPPI RACIST START 30 YEARS TO THE DAY FROM START OF THE 
FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thirty years to the day after he first stood trial for the murder of Medgar 
Evers, 73-year-old Bryon De La Beckwith began a remarkable third trial Thursday 
that promises to relive the tension-filled days of the civil rights era. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors described Beckwith, an unrepentant racist who claims he was 90 
miles away on the night that Evers was shot, as a violent "coward" who waged a 
tireless one-man campaign against integration. 
</P>
<P>
 "He embarked upon a one-man war, a war to purge society of anyone and anything 
that was for integration," said Bobby DeLaughter, the assistant district 
attorney whose dogged pursuit of the case over four years led to the new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the jury of eight blacks and four whites that evidence in the trial 
will show that Beckwith killed Evers with "a bullet that was aimed out of 
hatred, propelled by prejudice and fired by cowardice, a back-shooting coward 
at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Evers, the 37-year-old state field secretary of the NAACP, had angered 
segregationists by leading the crusade for civil rights in Mississippi, 
registering black voters and pressing to integrate the state's schools and 
other public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 He was killed by a bullet in the back shortly after midnight on June 12, 1963, 
as he returned home from a civil rights rally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith, a fertilizer salesman whose rifle was found near the scene, stood 
trial twice in 1964, both times before all-white juries. Both juries 
deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith, who wore a three-piece gray suit with a Confederate flag pin on the 
lapel, sat passively, yawned and nodded through most of the testimony Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Evers' widow, Myrlie Evers, a retired Los Angeles public works commissioner, 
testified that she was home with their children awaiting Evers return when she 
heard the rifle shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard the car pull into the driveway and the horrible blast and the 
children fell to the floor as he (Evers) had taught them to do," she said. "I 
ran to the front door, opened the door and there was Medgar at the steps 
leading to the front door with his keys in his hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice cracked and her eyes watered when DeLaughter showed her photographs 
of the murder scene and of Evers in his casket. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the trial so far has been like a replay of the first. It is 
being held in the same courtroom with its vaulted ceiling and dark, carved 
wood; Myrlie Evers was the first witness then as now. And signs of the 
segregated past still are present. 
</P>
<P>
 Restroom doors marking "white" and "colored" have been painted over but not 
removed from the building; the words "white women" can be seen on the men's 
room door on the third floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are significant differences, too. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first trial, the governor of Mississippi walked into the courtroom to 
wish Beckwith well, and, while it was not reported at the time, a 
state-sponsored anti-integration group called the Sovereignty Commission aided 
Beckwith's defense. Beckwith then was seen as a hero by many whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he is openly supported only by fringe elements in the white supremacist 
movement. And, unlike in 1964 when blacks were excluded from serving on juries, 
eight of the 12 jurors hearing the case are African American. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge facing prosecutors is to make a persuasive case with 30-year-old 
evidence against a man whom many Mississippians, black and white, feel should 
not be retried. 
</P>
<P>
 Many here feel the trial is more a search for a symbolic resolution to a 
chapter in history rather than a true dispensing of justice. The murder case is 
one of a number of violent civil rights-era crimes that continue to stain 
Mississippi's image and its conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Others feel justice would not be served by convicting a man so near the end of 
his life. During jury selection earlier this week, a black prospective juror, 
too young to remember the murder, said she felt sorry for the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 During opening statements, DeLaughter said he will present witnesses to whom 
Beckwith made incriminating statements about the murder and show that Beckwith 
was "an absolute, self-proclaimed rabid racist" who frequently aired his views 
in letters to newspapers. In the letters, he urged that "enemies of the white 
race must be purged from society and the leaders of the NAACP exterminated," 
DeLaughter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrida Coxwell, one of Beckwith's defense attorneys, said it was "physically 
impossible" for Beckwith to murder Evers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to find out that he was as far away from this location as you 
are from your homes right now," he told the jury, which was picked 140 miles 
away in Panola County because of the amount of publicity the case had received 
in the Jackson area. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith's rifle scope bore his fingerprints. But Coxwell said "that does not 
mean that Mr. Byron De La Beckwith fired the shot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In cross-examining prosecution witnesses, defense lawyers questioned how 
directly the evidence pointed to Beckwith. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness was Michael Baden, director of forensic science for the New York 
state police, who conducted a second autopsy on Evers' body in 1991. He noted 
that the body -- which he said was in "a remarkable state of preservation" and 
"looked as if it had just been embalmed the day before" -- had been better 
preserved than some of the evidence, which has been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 While Baden insisted that the speed with which the bullet traveled as it tore 
through Evers' body indicates that it came from a rifle, defense attorney Jim 
Kitchens tried to establish that the bullet could have been fired from some 
other weapon, such as a high-powered handgun.

SPECIAL COUNSEL GETS ARKANSAS OFFICE SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government signed a three-year lease Thursday for office space for 
special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr., who will investigate President and Mrs. 
Clinton's dealings with a real estate developer and savings and loan owner. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6,491 square feet of office space leased for Fiske and his staff in an 
office building in west Little Rock is on the same floor as the local FBI 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Murphy, regional real estate director for the General Services 
Administration, which leased the space for Fiske, said the length of the lease 
does not necessarily mean the investigation will last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We overestimated a little so we could get the best deal," Murphy said. He 
said the special counsel's space will cost $94,120 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said Fiske did not say how long he would be working in Little Rock, 
which Fiske has described as the "center of gravity" for the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske's review aims to find "whether any individuals or entities have 
committed a violation of any criminal law" with regard to the Clintons' 
involvement with Whitewater Development Co. Inc., Madison Guaranty Savings & 
Loan and a company called Capital Management Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons were 50-50 partners in Whitewater, a 230-acre real estate 
development in Marion County, with James B. McDougal, owner of Madison 
Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal and the Clintons have denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons also have said they lost about $69,000 in the Whitewater venture.

CLINTON PLAN IS SHRINKING DEFICIT, ANALYSTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office said Thursday that the Clinton 
Administration's economic plan, reinforced by an improving economy, will 
largely end the budget deficit crisis for the rest of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonpartisan office issued a new forecast predicting that the federal 
deficit will shrink to $166 billion by 1996 -- $124 billion below its estimates 
of just one year ago -- with the bulk of the improvement resulting from the 
Administration's deficit-reduction plan, which Congress passed last August. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit would then be equal to 2.2% of the national economy, its lowest 
level since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit peaked at $290 billion in 1992 and was $254 in 1993. If the CBO 
projection for 1996 is correct, Clinton will have achieved his campaign promise 
of cutting the deficit approximately in half during his four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 CBO Director Robert D. Reischauer told the Senate Budget Committee that his 
agency has estimated that the Clinton plan will reduce the deficit by a total 
of $433 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with an improving economy, which is driving income tax revenues up, 
the Clinton package is now working so well that Reischauer said there is no 
need for Congress to take further action to curb the deficit this year.  
</P>
<P>
 "The dramatic improvement is largely the result of the enactment" of the 
Clinton plan, Reischauer said. "The difficult step taken by the President and 
the Congress in adopting a major deficit-reduction package last August seems 
likely to achieve the desired outcome -- significantly lower deficits than were 
projected a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit will not surge significantly above the $200-billion annual level 
until after the year 2000, the CBO said, and will rise then only if Washington 
fails to take action on health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Without reforms to deal with rising health care costs and demographic 
pressures from an aging work force in the next century, Medicare and Medicaid 
costs will drive the deficit back up to $365 billion in 2004, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reischauer predicted that the deficit will be tamed without serious damage to 
the economy. While Republicans warned last year that Clinton's plan is so heavy 
with taxes that it would lead to a recession, the CBO said the economy will 
grow at a rate of 2.7% each year from 1994 through 1996 -- up from the 2.6% 
pace of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration will release its own revised deficit forecast when it 
unveils its 1995 budget on Feb. 7, but the CBO numbers may actually be slightly 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said last weekend that the White House is predicting that 
the 1995 deficit would fall to about $180 billion, but the CBO's report says 
the deficit will be just $171 billion that year. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House seized on the report and Reischauer's comments as vindication 
for Clinton's policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing I like better than delivering good news, and we sure have it 
today," said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. "We've been telling people all 
along that we're getting that deficit down and getting it down faster than we 
thought possible, and now we have an independent validation of that number." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said the new budget numbers will help blunt a 
congressional drive for a constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget, 
something Clinton has strongly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate is tentatively scheduled to take up the balanced-budget proposal in 
about three weeks .

NAVAJO LEADERS BAR VOTE ON CHANGING TRIBAL NAME TO DINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Navajo Nation Council on Thursday rebuffed an effort to let members of the 
tribe decide whether to change its name to Dine. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided on a 42-11 vote not to consider the change proposed by 
Navajo President Peterson Zah.Dine (pronounced dih-NEH) means "the People" in 
Navajo. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the name change cite ethnic and cultural identity, since the 
word Navajo was coined by outsiders. They wanted the change to be voted on by 
the 160,000 members of the Navajo Nation, which spans 27,000 square miles in 
Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe that the word Navajo has pueblo Indian or Spanish roots, said 
Duane Beyal, a Zah spokesman. "The meanings would range from 'thieves' and 
'raiders' to 'knife' to 'people with large planted fields,' depending on which 
origin you choose to believe in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Navajos said that they see the change as cosmetic and that the tribe 
should worry about pressing problems, such as education.

GEORGIA FLAG PROTEST TARGETS SUPER BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDITH STANLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of a protest against flying the Georgia state flag at the Super 
Bowl say they intend to use the controversy to press for removal of the 
Confederate battle symbol from the flag before the Summer Olympics begins here 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little chance that the flag will not flutter over the Georgia Dome on 
Sunday because state policy requires its use on state property and state 
officials and the NFL have declined to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 But the raising of the flag will enable demonstrators to "send the resounding 
message that we still have a lot of unfinished business of the civil rights 
movement to do," said state Sen. Ralph David Abernathy, son of the late civil 
rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are asking for the nation and the world to join us in this fight to remove 
this Confederate swastika from Georgia's flag," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abernathy, who has introduced another in a series of flag-change measures in 
the Georgia General Assembly, said protesters "will be organizing with the 
African nations . . . to demonstrate, protest and, if necessary, boycott the 
Olympics because of this symbol of disrespect and separatism that is 
embellished in this Georgia flag." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia incorporated the Confederate symbol in its flag in 1956 as an act of 
defiance against federal school-integration orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Gov. Zell Miller urged that the symbol be removed from the flag, 
but the General Assembly defeated the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Abernathy, along with several other black legislators, recently wrote a letter 
to National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue asking that the flag be 
barred from Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This abomination of racist symbolism should not be a part of nor associated 
with an event regarded . . . as a wholesome, family-oriented program," the 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charles Lunsford, heritage chairman for the Sons of Confederate Veterans, 
said "people who come here from around the country and around the world don't 
think anything bad about it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Bill Campbell told the Associated Press on Thursday that there are more 
pressing issues, such as jobs and education, crying out for attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have yet to hear anybody in the community tell me the flag flying there is 
going to affect their lives at all," said Campbell, who is black. "You can 
spend your life fighting a symbol and miss the important things." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Bruce Smith of the Buffalo Bills said he and his teammates don't 
like the idea of playing under the Confederate symbol, but he planned to focus 
on football. 
</P>
<P>
 "Racism exists, period," said Smith, who is black. "It's unfortunate. It's 
ignorance. It offends me."

PRO-ENVIRONMENT BLM DIRECTOR BACA IS OFFERED NEW INTERIOR JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bureau of Land Management Director Jim Baca, who has pushed for aggressive 
public land reform, has been offered a new job within the Interior Department, 
a spokesman acknowledged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure came after environmentalists began inquiring about "rumors" 
that Baca was being ousted because of his pro-environmental views on land 
reform, including Western grazing. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca, a former state commissioner of public lands in New Mexico and one of the 
Administration's most visible Latino appointees, has been widely praised within 
the environmental movement for his efforts to protect public land in the West 
from overgrazing and other abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Sweeney, the Interior Department's chief spokesman, acknowledged that 
Baca has been offered a job as deputy to Bob Armstrong, the assistant secretary 
for land and minerals management. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sweeney insisted that it is up to Baca to take the job and that he had not 
yet responded. "It's his decision. He's going to give it some thought," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca could not be reached immediately for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney emphasized that as deputy assistant secretary, the new director of the 
BLM as well as directors of the Minerals Management Service and the Office of 
Surface Mining would report to Baca directly. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman denied that the shift would be a setback to public land reform 
efforts. "The fundamental goals haven't changed and won't," he said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But several environmentalists, who have closely followed Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt's efforts at grazing and mining reform, saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a terrible mistake," if Baca were replaced, said Sierra Club 
legislative director Debbie Seas. "It would send a very bad signal . . . and 
could be a major setback to the Administration's stated land-reform goals."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; FIRST LADY TOURS AREAS HIT BY QUAKE; DISASTER: 
CHILDREN IN SOUTH-CENTRAL AND HOMEOWNERS IN HOLLYWOOD APPEAR CONSOLED BY MRS. 
CLINTON'S PRESENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton's visit to a quake-damaged South-Central elementary 
school began with great pomp Thursday as students lined up in descending order 
of height to properly greet the First Lady. It ended in a little huddle of 
humanity as the children wrapped themselves affectionately around her, not 
wanting to let go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can I hug you?" a little boy shyly inquired at one point and the First Lady 
gladly obliged, juggling a bundle of stories the children had written for her 
and letting them know that even now, 10 days after the devastating quake 
knocked them from their beds, the White House was still watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she left town Thursday, Mrs. Clinton would also visit a quake-ravaged 
street in Hollywood and attend Commitment to Life VII, an entertainment 
industry fund-raiser for AIDS Project Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But nowhere would she leave a more indelible mark than at Hyde Park Elementary 
School, where terrified children, holding puppets made from socks for her 
visit, were trying to comprehend this seismic disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Perched on a pint-size orange chair in an upstairs classroom, Mrs. Clinton 
chatted with her audience of fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders, somehow 
managing to find just the right words of condolence, no matter how terrible the 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom, she kept on screaming, she was keeping on crying and screaming," said 
a bewildered little boy named Craig. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds to me like you took really good care of your mom. You did a good 
job that night," she assured him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now sometimes I would be afraid to go to sleep because I think another one is 
coming," little Antonio confided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine not being scared," the First Lady replied.  
</P>
<P>
 "The door was shutting open and closed, and it was scary," a little girl named 
Delia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds as though your mother and father knew just what to do," Mrs. 
Clinton said.

 They wanted to know if she felt the earthquake in Washington. (They also 
wanted to know if she liked being a lawyer.) She drew a map of the United 
States on the blackboard and explained that she was "all the way over here" and 
did not feel the shaking, but that their stories had helped her understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an experience they keep living over and over again," Clinton said 
after a meeting with district officials and social workers, the children still 
pressed all around her. "One of the things I have worried about ever since the 
earthquake hit was the impact on the children. . . . I'm told that 15,000 to 
20,000 children still are not back in schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a makeshift dressing room next to the principal's office, she changed 
from a blue silk skirt and pumps to blue silk pants and flats and prepared to 
survey the quake damage that her husband had come to town to see only a few 
days before. 
</P>
<P>
 If his strategy was to reassure the devastated San Fernando Valley, hers was 
to soothe those in mostly verlooked Hollywood and South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 After a motorcade bulldozed its way through cross-town traffic, Mrs. Clinton 
emerged onto the 6000 block of Selma Avenue, an oak-lined street of historic 
Craftsman homes now bent and leaning. 
</P>
<P>
 She could offer little more than a sympathetic ear and a soothing voice. But 
residents, some of whom hadn't had a hot shower in days, seemed comforted by 
her presence. Raymond O'Keefe, an actor, led her to his back-yard patio where 
two pup tents were pitched. "This is where we live now," he said blankly as two 
tiny white dogs yapped at the First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks, I wanted to see this firsthand," she said, shaking her head 
sympathetically.  
</P>
<P>
 When another man went on in great detail about bolts and drills and shoring up 
foundations, she listened raptly. 
</P>
<P>
 After the First Lady had gone, 78-year-old Anna Perrine was still without hot 
water. The house where she had lived since 1933 was still uninhabitable. But 
she was smiling broadly, perhaps for the first time in days. "She was 
exquisite. She was warm and understanding," Perrine said, watching Mrs. Clinton 
pull away.  
</P>
<P>
 At the fund-raiser at the Universal Amphitheatre, Mrs. Clinton and Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, received Commitment to Life awards 
for their work in the fight against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment industry mogul David Geffen escorted Mrs. Clinton to the 
fund-raiser, where she watched a host of entertainers perform songs and recite 
tributes to AIDS patients. The event raised $5 million from ticket sales and 
corporate contributions, organizers said.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; SCHOOL MAY BE ABANDONED BECAUSE OF QUAKE 
DAMAGE

 The ground beneath Van Gogh Street Elementary School in Granada Hills is so 
unstable and crisscrossed by fissures that the site will probably have to be 
abandoned, Los Angeles school officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials predict, however, that the 370-student school will be the only 
campus to be shut down because of significant quake damage that struck about 
100 schools and cost $700 million throughout the sprawling district. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson announced the opening today of 14 more San Fernando Valley 
campuses that have been closed since the Jan. 17 quake. Another 33 schools, all 
in the Valley, remain closed, leaving about 40,000 Los Angeles students out of 
school for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The most severely damaged campuses -- two high schools, Kennedy and El Camino 
Real; four middle schools, Northridge, Lawrence, San Fernando and Frost, and 
two elementary schools, San Fernando and Van Gogh -- have been dubbed the "Big 
Eight" by school officials because of the severity of damage and uncertainty 
over when they can reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate by Monday morning we can give definitive information on what 
happens at each of these schools," Thompson said. "We realize you want your 
young people back. We will bring them back when it is safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Options include installing mobile classrooms in safe areas, finding 
alternative space in commercial and other buildings or transferring students to 
nearby schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brown, director of school facilities, told the school board Thursday that 
the latest geological survey of Van Gogh presents a bleak picture. 
</P>
<P>
 A deep crack snakes its way through the main corridor, and several other 
fissures are visible throughout the campus. Several deep cracks have broken 
classroom and hallway floors. The campus has no water. 
</P>
<P>
 An ominous sign greets visitors at the entrance to Van Gogh: "Parents: Please 
Leave Children Outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Maureen Diekmann said she is considering relocating the students to 
Frost Middle School.  
</P>
<P>
 District officials also announced that every school in the district has been 
given $5 per student to spend on emergency quake-related counseling, health 
care or the purchase of school supplies. Hard-hit campuses received $15 a 
student, aid provided by the U.S. Department of Education. Back in Session 
</P>
<P>
 The following Los Angeles Unified School District campuses will be open today: 
 
</P>
<P>
 * Blythe Street Elementary, Reseda * Calahan Street Elementary, Northridge * 
Chatsworth Park Elementary, Chatsworth * Germain Street Elementary, Chatsworth 
* Hale Middle School, Woodland Hills * Kester Avenue Elementary and Magnet 
School, Van Nuys * Lanai Road Elementary, Encino * Mayall Elementary, North 
Hills * Morningside Elementary, San Fernando * Napa Street Elementary, 
Northridge * North Valley Children's Center, Mission Hills * Reseda Elementary 
* Valley Alternative, Van Nuys * Vanalden Avenue Elementary and Children's 
Center, Reseda

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE TO HOLD CLASSES IN 
PORTABLE TRAILERS; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS SAY CONTINUING AFTERSHOCKS MAKE IT 
IMPOSSIBLE TO COUNT ON USING EXISTING BUILDINGS WHEN SCHOOL REOPENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Officials at Cal State Northridge, weary of reinspecting each of the campus's 
58 buildings for safety following aftershocks, said Thursday that they plan to 
use portable trailers for all classes and offices when school reopens two weeks 
late Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Provost Louanne Kennedy advised the school's deans to prepare spring and 
summer semester schedules using about 190 portable classrooms, which can hold 
about 25 people each and can be linked together to create larger spaces.  
</P>
<P>
 Another 100 trailers will be used for faculty office space, with professors 
likely staggering office hours and sharing desks, she said. The trailers will 
be located on the school's athletic fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to plan on the basis of no building on the main campus being 
available," Kennedy said. "If they come on line, then we'll use them, but we 
can't plan on that. Every time there is an aftershock, it changes the status of 
the buildings and then we have to start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 University officials and deans said that with creative planning and maximum 
use of limited space the campus would be able to accommodate an expected 
enrollment of 22,000 students. Usual spring enrollment is about 26,000 
students, Kennedy said, but many students are not expected to return because of 
the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Other contingency plans include holding classes in meeting halls near campus, 
borrowing laboratory space from corporations, teaching education students at 
local elementary schools and shipping advanced science students off to other 
colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Other likely adaptations include scheduling more classes during off-peak 
times, especially Friday nights and Saturdays, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever our students come, I would like to have classes for them," Kennedy 
told the deans. "They may not be the ideal classes, they may be larger, they 
may be in the Asian church across the street . . . but they will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Student housing could also be affected by the contingency plan announced 
Thursday for reopening the quake-damaged campus. About 1,350 students lived in 
university-owned apartments before the quake, according to Housing Director 
Roger Frichette. Although only 23% of the available housing was declared 
unsafe, all students may have to find new places to live, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge President Blenda J. Wilson said, however, she expects 
dorms and library space to be ready when students return. But the school must 
have a contingency plan since the aftershocks continue to shake the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now everything is unclear," Wilson said. "If you plan for not having 
anything, then everything you get is a bonus. If we sit here and try to guess, 
we'll never get any planning done." 
</P>
<P>
 The university, just blocks from the quake's epicenter, suffered serious 
damage in the main shock; some structures were weakened further by strong 
aftershocks that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a spokesman for Santa Monica College said the 24,000-student 
community college sustained $26 million in damage and would have to postpone 
the start of spring term one week to Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 He said school officials were scrambling to find enough portable buildings to 
replace classrooms lost to earthquake damage.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; 4.5 AFTERSHOCK BREAKS 4-DAY LULL; TEMBLOR: 
OFFICIALS WILL REINSPECT BUILDINGS NEAR THE NORTHERN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY 
EPICENTER. POST-QUAKE PATTERNS REMAIN NORMAL, SEISMOLOGISTS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 A magnitude 4.5 aftershock centered two miles west of Granada Hills at 9:19 
a.m. Thursday broke a four-day lull of only scattered mild aftershocks in the 
magnitude 3 range, but scientists reiterated that such moderately strong quakes 
are to be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologist Lucile M. Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey said that the 
number of aftershocks in any given day has been slowly diminishing since the 
6.6 temblor Jan. 17, but that quite a few more magnitude 4s and perhaps one 
more magnitude 5 are likely in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aftershocks are following a very normal pattern for Californian 
earthquakes," read a statement issued Thursday afternoon by four institutions 
that are actively studying the geology of the Northridge quake -- Caltech, the 
U.S. Geological Survey, the Southern California Earthquake Center at USC and 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the aftershocks continue at this rate, the probability of a magnitude 5 
aftershock in the next week is about one in five," the statement read. "We 
expect one or two more aftershocks of magnitude 4.5 or greater in the next 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones noted that a number of historic earthquakes in California have been 
followed by a "large late aftershock" that has done some damage and injury. For 
instance, the magnitude 7.7 Tehachapi earthquake of July 21, 1952, that killed 
12 people was followed a month later by a magnitude 5.8 temblor centered close 
to Bakersfield that killed two more. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1933 Long Beach 6.3 earthquake, a damaging 5.4 aftershock came seven 
months after the main shock, and in the 1983 Coalinga 6.5 earthquake, a 6.0 
aftershock came three months later near the town of Avenal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Avenal earthquake was larger in relation to the Coalinga main shock than 
is usually the case with aftershocks. Jones reported this week that 
historically, "the difference in magnitude between the main shock and largest 
aftershock can range from 0.1 to 3 or more, but averages 1.2." 
</P>
<P>
 This means that the largest average aftershock to have been expected from the 
6.6 Northridge temblor would have been 5.4. But that magnitude has already been 
exceeded, by the 5.6 shock that occurred on the afternoon of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday morning's aftershock, which authorities said would prompt some 
reinspection of buildings for damage in the area near its north Valley 
epicenter, was the 36th between magnitude 4.0 and 4.9 since the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same period, there have been two aftershocks between 5.0 and 5.6 
and more than 300 between 3.0 and 3.9. Altogether there have been more than 
3,150 aftershocks, still a long way from the 50,000 that have accumulated in 
the 19 months since the major Landers earthquake of June 28, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A quake must reach approximately magnitude 2.5 before most people feel it in 
their ordinary activities, and the vast majority of shocks are less than that. 
</P>
<P>
 But aftershocks, regardless of size, are studied closely by earthquake experts 
because they often delineate as clearly as anything the extent of the area 
directly involved in the earthquake, and by determining their relative depth, 
scientists can calculate the fault plane of the quake. Aftershocks also can 
demonstrate movement that has been triggered on other faults.  
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have put the depth of the origin of the Northridge main shock at 
about 11 miles. By locating the aftershocks, they believe that the unnamed 
thrust fault involved extends up, east and west from this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a circular plane, tilted at an angle of about 40 degrees from the 
earth's surface," the researchers said in a statement. "Its deepest point is at 
the main shock focus and its shallowest point is near the Santa Clarita Valley. 
. . . (But) we think the main shock fault does not extend up to the surface." 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of surface disturbance that have been found in Granada Hills, along the 
Santa Susana range and in Potrero Canyon west of Castaic Junction probably 
represent movements on other faults, some of the scientists say.  
</P>
<P>
 In a new observation Thursday, the four institutions added that they believe 
that the Northridge earthquake "occurred within the system of faults under the 
northern Los Angeles Basin that was recognized after the Whittier Narrows 
earthquake of 1987. We think this band of buried faults extends across the 
northern side of the basin and under the San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys," 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Bettina Boxall contributed to this story. Adding 
Aftershocks 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude 4.5 aftershock Thursday morning merely added to the list of 
seismic activity since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. Some aftershock 
totals: 
</P>
<P>
 * 2 aftershocks magnitude 5.0-5.6 
</P>
<P>
 * 36 aftershocks magnitude 4.0-4.9 
</P>
<P>
 * 302 aftershocks magnitude 3.0-3.9 
</P>
<P>
 * 3,150 total aftershocks

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE FACTS: DAMAGE REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some facts and figures on the aftermath of last week's magnitude 6.6 
earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * DEATHS: 57 (state estimate) 
</P>
<P>
 * INJURIES: More than 7,671 people have been treated and released at 
hospitals; about 690 were admitted for care.  
</P>
<P>
 * AFTERSHOCKS: A magnitude 4.5 aftershock at 9:19 a.m. Thursday was centered 
two miles west of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * DAMAGE: More than 25,148 buildings had been inspected. Officials have 
declared 5,812 buildings, including 15,581 dwelling units, at least partially 
unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARRESTS: Since the quake, the Los Angeles Police Department has taken 418 
people into custody. On a typical day, there are about 530 arrests in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOMELESS: Almost 1,869 remained housed in 176 Army tents at five San 
Fernando Valley parks. Thirty-one tents have been removed from Lanark 
Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * NATIONAL GUARD: Officials said some of the 1,000 National Guard troops 
mobilized to help in disaster relief efforts will begin moving out of the city, 
but some will be replaced by Guard troops from other areas. About 108 bilingual 
Guard troops are acting as translators. 
</P>
<P>
 * UTILITIES: The Southern California Gas Co. said an estimated 18,000 
customers remained without gas service as of Thursday, largely because 
personnel cannot get into houses to check for possible leaks. Customers must 
make arrangements with neighbors or have someone meet gas company personnel to 
get into their homes. All gas company employees carry official identification. 
Approximately 150,000 homes, apartments and businesses lost gas service after 
the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake and aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRANSIT: A commuter hot line, (800) 286-RIDE, has been set up to provide 
information on car pools, road closures and other information.  
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink will open the Vincent Grade/Acton station Monday, the fourth station 
on the Antelope Valley Emergency extension from Santa Clarita. The station is 
off the Antelope Freeway (California 14) on Sierra Highway, south of the Sierra 
Highway and Angeles Forest Highway intersection. The station will have 500 free 
parking spaces.  
</P>
<P>
 * HELP: The 21st Disaster Application Center will open today at the Ronald 
Reagan Presidential Library, 40 Presidential Drive, Simi Valley. It will be 
open 1 to 10 p.m. today, then 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
 * DUMP: The city of Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation will open the Lopez 
Canyon landfill in Lake View Terrace this weekend to all city residents for 
disposal of earthquake-related material at no charge. The landfill will be open 
Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

2 FLORIDA COUNTIES TO TEST CLINTON-STYLE WELFARE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Administration approved an experiment in two Florida counties Thursday 
that will give poor people a taste of the reforms President Clinton is 
advocating for the entire country. 
</P>
<P>
 The experimental programs will put a two-year time limit on public assistance 
benefits and require recipients to work, two of the basic principles of 
Clinton's welfare reform strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine other states already have received Administration approval to try welfare 
reform projects, but the Florida initiative most resembles the plan being 
designed by the Administration working group on welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In his State of the Union speech Tuesday, Clinton said that he would introduce 
welfare reform legislation this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida experiment could provide a sneak preview of what the rest of the 
country would face if the Administration succeeds in pushing its plan through 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other states will want to look at it as they think of how they want to 
proceed themselves," said Mary Jo Bain, an assistant health and human services 
secretary who is a leader of the welfare reform working group. "We continue to 
learn a lot about welfare reform from these state demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to force the President to move faster, Senate Republicans 
Thursday called a press conference to push their own welfare reform bill, which 
was introduced Tuesday and has much in common with what the President has 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton continues to fiddle while millions of Americans are trapped 
in a welfare system that creates dependency and condemns them and their 
children to poverty," said Sen. Hank Brown (R-Colo.). "Our plan changes welfare 
to a program that offers hope, opportunity and independence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida plan, called the "Family Transition Program," will limit to 24 
months the length of time some welfare families in two Florida counties, 
Escambia and Alachua, will be eligible for Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children benefits in any five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is a system that provides temporary help for families, to help them 
succeed on their own -- instead of creating a life-dependency for generations," 
said Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Participation will be mandatory in Escambia County, which includes Pensacola, 
and voluntary in Alachua, which includes Gainesville. The total current number 
of welfare recipients in the two counties is 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Able-bodied people who want to work will get the chance to work and those who 
don't want to work will be out the door in two years," said Jim Towey, 
secretary of the state's Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services.  
</P>
<P>
 The similarities between the Florida project and the federal working group's 
yet-to-be-unveiled plan reportedly include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Case workers will use every effort to get private sector jobs for 
participants as soon as they walk through the welfare office door. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before getting jobs, participants will be required to attend school or job 
training classes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Government-subsidized child care will be available during the training 
period and for the first two years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exemptions from the work requirement for parents with young children will be 
available only for those with children up to 6 months, rather than 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Participants who cannot find private-sector jobs by the end of two years 
will be offered public-sector jobs.

JUDGMENT AGAINST ANIMAL GROUP VOIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $4.2-million judgment against animal rights activists was overturned 
Thursday when the Nevada Supreme Court ruled against a Las Vegas entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Berosini charged that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) 
defamed him by secretly filming him beating his orangutans backstage at the 
Stardust Hotel, then releasing the tape to the media. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a 4-0 vote, justices ruled the tape accurately portrayed the way 
Berosini disciplined his animals and PETA had a right to express an opinion on 
whether he was being cruel to them.

GOVERNMENT: WHEN IT WORKS WELL, AND WHEN IT DOESN'T; QUAKE AFTERMATH REVEALS 
BREATHTAKING EFFORTS -- AND INADEQUACIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 News flash: Earthquakes don't delay while politicians and bureaucrats dither. 
They happen unpredictably, as we know so well, often with deadly and 
devastating results. That's why upgrading the seismic safety of older buildings 
and other facilities is not to be regarded as a matter of bureaucratic routine 
or political convenience. It is, literally, a life-or-death issue. Where 
seismic safety is involved the watchword must be urgency.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four years ago Los Angeles voters approved a $376-million bond issue to 
make city buildings and bridges safer. The inspiration for that measure was 
Northern California's 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which properly was seen as a 
warning to bring older structures up to modern safety standards. And just what 
has been done with that $376 million? Inexcusably little. Less than $30 million 
has been spent so far on needed improvement. Work has been completed on only 40 
of the 160 bridges marked for upgrading. Of the 34 city buildings targeted, 
only eight have been improved. So much for a sense of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Los Angeles, 22 libraries remain closed because of earthquake damage, 
and a number of police stations, especially in the San Fernando Valley, were 
hit severely. Yet voters years ago approved other bond issues specifically 
intended to finance remodeling of libraries and police stations. Those bond 
issues totaled $229 million. Most of that money -- $176 million -- remains 
unspent. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer Robert Horii says the slowness in putting all of this money to 
work can be blamed on a shortage of city workers to issue and oversee 
contracts, write bid specifications and the like. He said he tried years ago to 
get the City Council to hire more employees for these tasks but was rebuffed. 
City Council members Zev Yaroslavsky and Joel Wachs counter that the fault lies 
with the bureaucracy, not, heaven forfend, with the council. So round and round 
we go. Eventually, 50 additional workers were assigned to speeding up 
bond-related construction. But precious years had been lost. There's no telling 
how much of last week's quake damage to city property might have been avoided 
if the city quickly had done with the bond money what the voters intended. 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE PLUS SIDE: City government isn't always so inept. Take the story about 
the City Council employees who wouldn't take post-quake price gouging and fraud 
sitting down. Staff members of City Council member Laura Chick, they were 
discussing how to curb the exploitation being suffered by those who unknowingly 
were hiring rip-off artists to repair earthquake damage. Chick suggested that 
the aides gather flyers from the parks and tent city locations and then phone 
the supposedly experienced and licensed contractors to request estimates for 
staffers whose homes needed work. The LAPD was in on the sting, and the 
California Contractor License Board's Unlicensed Activity Unit was at the homes 
to make arrests if crimes occurred. Four people have been charged with fraud 
felonies so far and more arrests are coming. After an emergency is declared, 
unlicensed contractors who perform reconstruction can be charged with a felony 
punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine of up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example of good government action is the effort of Caltrans, the state 
transportation agency, to get us to car-pool. One bit of clever work is its 
gambit on the Santa Monica Freeway. On this east-west thoroughfare, severed 
near Fairfax Avenue, Caltrans has provided one easy detour off and back on the 
freeway for cars with more than one passenger; there's a less easy, longer 
route for the single-occupancy vehicle. Car pool, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 BUT OH THOSE LINES: Thousands of earthquake victims who need emergency food 
stamps are stuck in horrendous lines -- sometimes competing with opportunists 
trying to take advantage of this crisis. Anyone with a photo ID can get the aid 
because federal officials compassionately eliminated the customary formal proof 
of need so that hungry families who apply today can eat today. But to better 
serve the truly needy in Los Angeles, officials should require some proof of 
need and keep careful records of who gets help so any fraud can be prosecuted. 
To help keep the county centers open longer, the National Guard should bolster 
security.

QUAKE'S POWER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 * As TV viewers in the Midwest and Northeast watched the Rose Bowl game on a 
typically warm and clear New Year's Day in Southern California, I remember 
thinking that I could almost hear that snap-snap of opening suitcases as nearly 
frozen fingers fumbled for belongings and plans were made to move west. And now 
I'm almost certain I can hear the sound once more as the luggage is popped open 
again, contents neatly put in place, and the U-Hauls are returned unused. Oh, 
the power of an earthquake.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: LOW-PAYING JOBS FACTOR IN WELFARE FRAUD; FOR AID 
RECIPIENTS WITH CHILDREN, ACCEPTING MINIMUM WAGE IS A STEP BACKWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY LEAMAN, Larry Leaman is director of the Orange County Social Services 
Agency. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month a welfare fraud study was released that found fraud by 62% of the 
parents investigated in the child-only welfare caseload in Orange County (cases 
in which children receive aid, but their parent or parents do not). The major 
cause of the high fraud rate was income being concealed.  
</P>
<P>
 What a trap our nation's welfare system is, and yet for many, mostly mothers 
and their kids, it is the best homeless prevention program we have because when 
you are unskilled and lack self-confidence, the work you can find, when you can 
find it, does not pay enough to support yourself and your kids. We can say, 
"Well then, you shouldn't have kids," but we have to get real -- more and more 
people are having kids, purposely, without any idea of how they will support 
them. Add to this the families that are never formed (25% of all births in our 
country are to single women) and the fact many women with kids never dreamed 
they would be divorced or abandoned by their husbands, and we have reality -- a 
growing population of mothers who lack the skills and marketability to support 
themselves and their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what can be done about it? First, values are not really something 
government can do much about. The best thing we can do is make the magnitude 
and consequences of what is happening known -- a continuous wake-up call, with 
the hope it will stimulate many to do more than just shake their heads in 
amazement or disgust. Yet, I wonder what can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare reform has been a very popular social and political issue for 20 years 
or more, and many efforts to implement change have been made. Many of my 
colleagues and I refer to most of these efforts as tinkering, rather than major 
reform. Hopefully, the President's welfare reform will somehow make work pay 
for everyone, even the mom looking at the minimum-wage job. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some client advocates try to excuse welfare cheating as "What else 
can they do?" fraud is fraud and must be dealt with. We can decry the decisions 
they made that got them into their situations, but the multitude of our 
nation's welfare programs, in seeking to provide basic subsistence to kids and 
parents, has produced a situation in which low-paying work is a step backward. 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare "system" is a non-system and a mess. But, when work at legal wages 
does not pay enough to enable a working parent to pay rent and put food on the 
table, welfare in some form will continue to exist. Hopefully, we can continue 
to fight against cheating, but with the downward spiral of our societal code of 
ethics that we all see in our daily lives (and on T.V. every evening), we know 
that fight will be never-ending. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, we should try to remember that some clients are indeed honest 
and in dire need of welfare, and that assistance is the lifesaver for them it 
is supposed to be. It's probably the best homeless-prevention program that 
exists. It's hard to remember that, when we find 60% or more fraud in part of 
our welfare caseload, but we should try.

BEN STILLER'S COMING OF AGE; PREMIERE OF HIS FIRST FILM PUTS DIRECTOR IN 
SUNDANCE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faxes with his name on them sit on a counter, a Federal Express package waits 
downstairs, a woman is on the phone arranging screening tickets, a man has just 
arrived to take his clothes to the cleaners. And in the middle of it all sits 
Ben Stiller, comfortably rumpled in torn jeans and a well-worn flannel shirt 
and looking like this fuss couldn't possibly be about him. 
</P>
<P>
 But of course it is. Stiller's "Reality Bites," which he directed and co-stars 
in, is about to have its world premiere in a prestigious out-of-competition 
slot tonight at the Sundance Film Festival, complete with program notes 
describing it as "the twentysomething film we've all been waiting for." 
</P>
<P>
 A completely charming romance starring Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke that 
manages to be warm and empathetic without losing its sharp comic edge, 
"Reality" is poised to position Stiller in the forefront of what co-producer 
Michael Shamberg, who developed the project, calls "a new generation of 
mainstream talent." But is Ben Stiller calm and relaxed about all of this? What 
do you think? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited that the film's here, but I feel a little bit like an outsider," 
he says with an appealing uncertainty. "Though it has an independent spirit, it 
wasn't financed independently, and I'm a little nervous about studio movie 
backlash. (Universal is releasing "Reality" on Feb. 18.) With (Sundance) films 
being made for $20,000, if you didn't put up your entire life savings, people 
may think you're taking advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Stiller, 28, also has reservations about this story -- four college friends 
trying to find their way in the nominally real world -- being labeled the 
quintessential Generation X movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, that's like a disaster," he says. "Whenever I hear that I think, 
'Screw you, somebody's trying to sell me something.' This generation doesn't 
want to embrace anything, doesn't want to be sold to, and it's very aware of 
people trying to take advantage of it. When we did a test screening in Berkeley 
and the Universal logo came on the screen, they hissed. Everyone is so 
cynical." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with his thick black hair and quietly intense manner, Stiller, already a 
10-year show-business veteran, comes by his anxieties naturally. His parents 
are the gifted actors and comedians Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara and he 
grinningly admits to being one of those kids who could never stop performing. 
</P>
<P>
 "While my parents were doing 'Prisoner of Second Avenue' in summer stock, my 
sister Amy and I would be acting out the play in the lobby," he remembers. 
"When I was 8 we'd be doing fake Shakespeare in our living room, with pillows 
strapped to our heads for hats and me wearing my sister's tights -- oy , I 
shouldn't talk about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Having decided early on that he wanted to be a director ("I've always said it, 
my whole life"), Stiller got his start making Super 8 movies when he was 10. "I 
grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and from time to time got mugged by 
the older kids on the way to school, so my first films were these 'Death 
Wish'-type revenge things," he says, not quite believing it himself. "They all 
had the same plot, me being pushed to the ground then taking revenge, and they 
had titles like 'They Called It Murder' and 'Murder in the Park.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stiller was admitted to UCLA but dropped out early in part because "I think I 
matured later than most people, I was not ready to break away from my parents." 
He lived at home for a year, "feeling really lost, wondering what do I do, how 
do I go forward, which is where I can identify with the kids in 'Reality 
Bites.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He became involved in acting as a way into directing and eventually made his 
professional debut in the 1985 Lincoln Center revival of John Guare's "The 
House of Blue Leaves." Parts in films like "Empire of the Sun" and "Fresh 
Horses" followed, but Stiller never gave up on his short films. One of them, a 
parody of "The Color of Money," got him a job at "Saturday Night Live," which 
in turn led to "The Ben Stiller Show" first on MTV and then on the Fox network. 
</P>
<P>
 It was short-lived but won a writing Emmy last year for Stiller and co-writer 
Judd Apton, and with such skits as "Oliver Stoneland," where "the objective is 
not to escape but confront," and "Cape Munster," where Eddie comes back to take 
revenge on the executive who canceled his show, revealed a formidable comic 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not totally happy with parody ("an existence based on someone else's 
creativity"), Stiller did wonder if his facility with it would hamper his 
direction of "Reality Bites." "I didn't know if I could do it, if I had it in 
me to make a real movie, especially one that I saw could be parodied," he 
admits. "But you have to be willing to take chances that could be made fun of, 
to be willing to put yourself out there in a very vulnerable position." 
</P>
<P>
 What persuaded Stiller to commit was "Reality's" lively and entertaining 
script, written by 23-year-old USC film school graduate Helen Childress. "Helen 
and I really hit it off, we had the same sense of humor, that's why I did the 
project," says Stiller, who says his way of connecting with the script was 
working with Childress on the character he eventually came to play himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael is a video executive who falls in love with Winona's character 
Lelaina," he explains. "Originally (the character was planned to be) in his 
mid-30s, outside their generation, someone like Bill Pullman in 'Sleepless in 
Seattle' who obviously is not right." Eventually Michael became another facet 
of the 20s generation and a true rival for Lelaina's affections, and Stiller 
took the role. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryder was the first person cast for "Reality Bites" ("Instinctively she knew 
she should play this part"), and it was she who suggested Ethan Hawke for Troy, 
the cynical slacker with a complex relationship with Lelaina. "Ethan has always 
played sensitive, naive, sweeter guys," Stiller says, "and it was really fun 
working with him to see how far we could go in making him hard-edged and bitter 
and still have people like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Having wanted to direct for so long, Stiller was more than relieved to find 
that yes, he really did like it, and happy to be able to place his mother in a 
small part, although it was "embarrassing to have to call her 'Mom' in front of 
the crew." Yet, as someone who is able to do commercial work that has 
integrity, Stiller admits that the decision as to how commercial he wants to be 
"is something I struggle with." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some days I want to be Woody Allen, and some days I want to be Renny Harlin 
("Cliffhanger"), but only for a day," he says, laughing. "I'm not a Hollywood 
guy, but I understand how the system works. And I love to work so much I hope I 
never let the desire to work overtake my sense of judgment. I guess I just have 
to trust myself."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: JACKSON ROBS MEDIA OF A SEXY THRILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 WANTED: Celebrity qualified for bashing by media. Immediate opening for 
someone globally known, loved and admired. High visibility a must. Suspected 
sexual perversion or criminal sickness preferred, but will consider other 
afflictions or titillatingly kinky behaviors that are highly exploitable and 
suitable for leading newscasts. Large acreage that choppers with camera crews 
can fly over an advantage. Desperate for applicants. If interested call 
1-800-JACKALS.  
</P>
<P>
 Bummer! 
</P>
<P>
 Just when the media has another great trial to look forward to, Michael 
Jackson goes and ruins it all by throwing cash at the 14-year-old boy whose 
lawsuit alleged that the entertainer had sexually molested him. Just when 
everyone was revving up. Just when the adrenaline was flowing. Now, this is no 
knock on Tonya Harding but, quite frankly, she's no Michael. Who wants to fly 
over an ice rink? 
</P>
<P>
 Michael, Michael, Michael. Do we deserve this kick in the pants? Talk about 
your thoughtless celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 These are trying times. Oh, sure, newscasts and newspapers from New York to 
Hong Kong are now speculating about how many millions or zillions Jackson paid 
the boy and whether the settlement has put the kibosh on possible criminal 
charges against the world's most famous entertainer. And TV can always send up 
the choppers again for old time's sake, keeping them over Neverland for a week 
or so and fueling them airborne, the way SAC bombers were perpetually in the 
sky during the Cold War. And someone can put in a fast call to LaToya and set 
up another press conference before Sally Jessy or Geraldo get her. She'd be 
good copy for a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also, there's "The Jackson Family Honors" to look forward to. That's the 
delayed Jackson family special that has now been given a Feb. 22 airdate on 
NBC, right on cue for ratings sweeps. Will Michael show up? Will the 
14-year-old boy show up? Will Liz? Will Michael's personal confessor/press 
agent, Oprah, emerge from the wings to sit for another Michael Jackson 
exclusive on the real story, from his lips to America's ears? You can almost 
see and hear him now: Oprah, how could anyone really believe that I . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Will this all-star cast break out the balloons and confetti? Will all of them 
appear on stage side by side with their lawyers, faces beaming, raised hands 
triumphantly fastened together in unity the way former political foes do at 
Democratic and Republican nominating conventions? 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly not. But even if they all do, it just won't be the same. The 
thrill will be gone, the pitch-black cloud of alleged pedophilia having faded 
to gray. Nothing much to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, brother. And they say predation is easy work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night's "Hard Copy," you could see the sorrow and disappointment 
in the eyes of Diane Dimond's, eyes that previously had danced with excitement 
at each mention of Michael Jackson, at each alleged deviant fusion of him with 
his accuser and other young boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Her relentless reporting for "Hard Copy" had made her Michael's tabloid 
Boswell, so renowned for insider poop that at one point she was interviewed 
about the case on "CBS This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, all she had for inquiring minds was a measly brief update, the 
usual money talk, an unsatisfying few words that hung in the air like a somber 
obituary for a story that she and her like-minded media lizards had slaved and 
slithered so hard to distort and hyperbolize. No wonder she seemed deflated. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happens now? Where do we go from here? Who becomes the next sacrifice 
on the altar of the people's right to know? Lorena's on the way out. Bill and 
Hillary seem impenetrable. Tonya and Nancy can't last forever. Who else will 
come along now to nourish the sucklings of the media and the monologues of Leno 
and Letterman, who else to have their miseries become the public's intravenous 
drippings? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer could be as near as tonight's headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jackson's lawyers are counting on media fickleness -- that after an interim 
period of mourning about the settlement, interest will atrophy to the point 
that Jackson will be able to spin his version of the truth in his venue of 
choice without being cross-examined -- they have history on their side. The 
record stretches endlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the venues are international or domestic, TV in particular springs 
from one hot spot or torrid subject to another like someone hopping barefoot 
across sizzling coals. You only have to examine the broad ethnic demographics 
of the media's targets to see just how ludicrous it was to imply (as some have) 
that racism was behind the unfair Jackson coverage. In going for the jugular, 
red is the only color that attracts predators. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to finessing the media, the Jackson entourage knows what it's 
doing, as does Larry R. Feldman, attorney for the 14-year-old boy. Feldman's 
tight-lipped circumspection on TV this week is a screeching U-turn from his 
earlier strategy, when he saw verbosity in front of the cameras as being in his 
client's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Jackson has justifiably railed at some of the media for using him as 
fodder for lurid headlines, he and his handlers have been maestros of media 
orchestration. As his many defenders note, Jackson has done many good works. 
The public is aware of many of them, however, because of his benevolence being 
documented by TV cameras that were summoned to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And as for Jackson attorney Howard Weitzman's earlier complaints about his 
client being savagely used by many in the media, puleeeze! That's like Abbott 
complaining about Costello. To understand that, flash back a decade to 
Weitzman's own daily stagecraft for TV cameras outside the courthouse during 
the drug trial of John Delorean. And what were Weitzman and Johnnie L. Cochran 
Jr., another Jackson attorney, doing this week if not attempting to use the 
media to put a rosy glow on all of this? 
</P>
<P>
 The media are used, the media use. Unless criminal charges are filed against 
Jackson (which most experts say is now unlikely), a successor will be required 
for the spotlight, perhaps someone new, perhaps a ghost of the past. Say, 
whatever happened to Pee-wee Herman?

ROYCE HALL COULD BE CLOSED TO ARTS EVENTS THROUGH '94; QUAKE DAMAGE: THE 1927 
BUILDING THAT HOUSES UCLA'S SHOWPIECE AUDITORIUM MAY UNDERGO SEISMIC 
STRENGTHENING. WADSWORTH THEATER IS ITS BACKUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The theater in UCLA's Royce Hall, the architectural symbol and showcase venue 
for the school, will remain closed for at least two months, and may even remain 
so into 1995, university officials predicted Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The towers of the Romanesque building suffered some structural damage in the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, and the auditorium cannot be used until they are shored up 
-- a process that campus architect Charles Oakley hopes can be completed within 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earthquake, the entire building had been slated for seismic 
strengthening, a process it may now undergo immediately so the auditorium will 
not have to close again in the future. A decision will be made in the next few 
weeks, officials said. Classrooms and some offices in the building remain open 
for now, but would be closed for the seismic strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 Most performances scheduled for the 1,850-seat theater have been moved to the 
Wadsworth Theater, a 1,450-seat venue near the UCLA campus. But because the 
Wadsworth has a smaller stage, the Feb. 5 performance by the State Symphony of 
Russia and the Feb. 26 performance of the L'Orchestre National de France have 
been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances for the 1994-95 season are now being scheduled, and while Center 
for the Arts Director Michael Blachly hopes the Royce Hall theater will open by 
then, he also has developed an alternate plan that relies primarily on the 
Wadsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Royce has got a track record and a history," Blachly said. "I know it's a 
priority to do it right and to do it as efficiently as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The theater's grand stage and lavish interior attract world-class artists, and 
the building itself, one of the oldest on campus, has come to symbolize UCLA. 
Designed in 1927 by the firm Allison & Allison, Royce Hall combines elements of 
Mediterranean and Classical architecture and helps anchor UCLA's main quad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great old building," said Oakley, of the building's architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Robert Blocker, dean of UCLA's School of the Arts: "The building is so 
important to the university and to the community that it will receive top 
priority."

INDIA'S SOUNDTRACKS GET DOWN, DIRTY; POP MUSIC: TREND DUBBED 'RUSTIC RAUNCH' 
CLASHES WITH THE OFFICIAL PRUDISHNESS AND HUSHED-UP SEXUALITY THAT HAVE TAKEN 
ROOT IN THE LAND THAT ONCE PRODUCED THE KAMA SUTRA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 First there's the rhythm line, as unsubtle as a panting steam locomotive. Then 
the singer's sultry voice, earthy and suggestive: "What's beneath my blouse?" 
Ila Arun croons temptingly. What indeed? 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart is beneath my blouse," she warbles in reply to her own question. 
"And this heart, I will give it to my beloved." 
</P>
<P>
 Grunge or gangsta rap it's not. But Arun's spicy Hindi-language tune about the 
secrets hidden by her choli , or bare-belly Rajasthani blouse, has become a 
controversial smash in India and brought a revolution in the usually staid, 
syrupy soundtracks of mass-market movies here. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear this music, you're tempted to go see the film it comes from on 
the big screen," Nandita Baruah, a New Delhi-based research associate, says 
enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 To lure more members of her "MTV generation" to the theater, the 28-year-old 
Baruah says, Indian producers are now getting down and dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans might not think so. But Indian cinema was once so strait-laced 
that it preferred to show a pair of doves contentedly cooing or two flowers 
blooming in time-lapse photography to symbolize the hero and heroine going into 
a torrid clutch. 
</P>
<P>
 Arun has shaken things up with a modernized and suggestive off-screen folk 
tune that helped make a hit out of the movie "Khalnayak" ("The Villain") by 
being released beforehand as a cassette and a music video. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing long lines form for "Khalnayak," Bombay's cinema barons took notice. 
"Going by the evidence, 1994 is going to be the year of smutty lyrics," Amode 
Mehra, who helps compile and grade songs for a televised hit parade, has 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Already on Indian screens, or reported to be on the way, are production 
numbers based on traditional folk ditties with these words, utilizing double 
entendres and pregnant pauses: 
</P>
<P>
 * "I am a train, please give me a push, my engine is hot, please give me a 
push. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * "I'll put it . . . I'll put it my darling . . . I'll put a nine- lakh 
(900,000 rupee) necklace around your neck." 
</P>
<P>
 (And this one, which uses metaphors from the sport of cricket:) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Yesterday my lover bowled such a torrid spell, I couldn't sleep a wink all 
night; four times I hit the ball, the fifth I couldn't handle."  
</P>
<P>
 "These people think, if 'Khalnayak' could sell because of 'Choli,' then the 
public probably wants more," Arun said proudly in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 India Today magazine has christened the emerging trend in pop music "rustic 
raunch," since it clashes with the official prudishness and hushed-up sexuality 
that have taken root in the land that once produced the Kama Sutra. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the post-"Choli' tunes are considered sufficiently risque to have been 
banned from All India Radio. But they circulate anyway on cassettes or in their 
video version on privately owned Zee TV. Some Indians think they epitomize a 
more relaxed attitude about sex, others, like Baruah, that they could be just a 
short-lived fad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Folk tunes in regions of India like Arun's native Rajasthan often have 
suggestive, even bawdy lyrics. Since the smash hit "Beneath My Choli," she has 
gone on to sing a steamy video version of "Bicchu," or "Scorpion," which likens 
the first experience of physical love to the arachnid's sting. 
</P>
<P>
 Her latest soundtrack shocker is from a movie called "Dalaal" ("The Broker"). 
With the male and female leads dancing and female extras lifting their saris 
archly in the background, Arun sings off camera: "He climbed on top of me . . . 
the pigeon on the terrace." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bombay-based entertainer, who plans to tour California this summer, is 
proud to be reviving some of India's less genteel traditions. She scoffs at the 
suggestion that her popularity means a decline in public morals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Indians know how to have fun," Arun said. "In Hindi, you know, you can't 
judge a song by its first line. It's the lyricist's intelligence that can make 
you wonder."

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; 'FIRM' NOT LOSING SLEEP OVER 'SEATTLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

 "Sleepless in Seattle" is trying to loosen the firm grip of "The Firm" on the 
rental chart's No. 1 position, but no luck so far. At just about any other 
time, "Sleepless," starring Tom Hanks, would own the top spot.But there are 
just too many Tom Cruise and/or John Grisham fans in the rental market. "Dave," 
the Kevin Kline comedy, also has No. 1 potential that may never be realized 
because of the competition. It climbed two more notches to No. 3 but will have 
trouble moving any higher. The sun appears to have set on "Rising Sun's" 
chances at No. 1. It peaked at No. 2 and could never sneak past the December 
chart leader "Cliffhanger." Two newcomers--"Heart and Souls" (No. 14) and 
"Menace II Society" (No. 18)--should do strong rental business. 
</P>
<P>
 * This must be freewheeling parody month on home video. Another one of those 
gag-a-second comedies, "Robin Hood: Men in Tights," just came out, on the heels 
of "Hot Shots! Part Deux," which is No. 7 after two weeks. Mel Brooks' "Robin" 
made $35.3 million at the box office and should easily be a Top 10 rental. It's 
off to a good start, entering at No. 14. Source: Billboard Publications Inc.

POP ALBUM CHART; SALT-N-PEPA SCORES A 'NECESSARY' HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Salt-N-Pepa's "Very Necessary" moved up two notches to No. 10, boosted by the 
album's second hit single, "Whatta Man." No other female rap act--and few male 
rappers for that matter--can touch the group's commercial success. Mariah Carey 
continues to lead a chart that contains a few surprises, among them the 
alternative-rock group Counting Crows, whose hit "August and Everything After" 
wings its way from No. 32 to No. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Ace of Base's album "The Sign" rose two rungs to No. 16, proving that the 
group is no one-hit wonder. Following the success of the band's "All That She 
Wants," the album's title song climbed on the singles chart from No. 16 to No. 
5. Tom Petty's "Greatest Hits," which moved from No. 9 to No. 5, is enjoying an 
unusually good run in the Top 10, lasting long after the Christmas season when 
such packages are at peak popularity. The jazz-rap group Us3 is scoring big 
with its first album, "Hand on the Torch," up from No. 52 to 43. 
</P>
<P>
 * The hottest new album is the "Philadelphia" soundtrack, featuring Bruce 
Springsteen's "Streets of Philadelphia." It jumped from No. 34 to No. 17.

CNN, NEWSMAN FRED FRIENDLY WIN DUPONT-COLUMBIA AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CNN's coverage of the civil war in Bosnia and documentaries about Asia, 
presidential campaign finances and boxer Mike Tyson were among the winners 
Thursday of the annual Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards for 
outstanding broadcast journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The only individual honored in the ceremonies in New York was Columbia 
journalism professor emeritus Fred W. Friendly, a former TV producer and 
president of CBS News who was lauded as having served for five decades as a 
"catalyst and conscience for the highest standards of excellence and public 
service in all media." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 winning programs, which included national and local productions, 
included the PBS "Frontline" documentary "The Best Campaign Money Can Buy," 
about the financing of the 1992 presidential campaign; the PBS series "The 
Pacific Century," a 10-hour look by Jigsaw Productions Inc. at the rise of 
Asia's political and economic power, and a segment of ABC's "20/20" titled "The 
Gift of Life," about an Army surgeon who saved the life of a soldier in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 CNN was honored for its continuing coverage of the conflict in Bosnia by 
correspondents Christiane Amanpour, Jim Clancy, Brent Sadler and Jackie 
Shymanski. "Filled with the horror of war, their reporting is tough yet deeply 
human," the judges said. 
</P>
<P>
 A documentary produced by Barbara Kopple and shown on NBC, "Fallen Champ: The 
Untold Story of Mike Tyson," was also a winner, cited by the judges as 
"comprehensive, sensitive and completely insightful." 
</P>
<P>
 Other TV winners were MW Productions for "Harry Bridges: A Man and His Union"; 
WPLG-TV in Miami for "Armed Enemies of Castro"; Wisconsin Public Television for 
"Move Over: Women and the '92 Campaign"; WBFF-TV in Baltimore and Deborah 
Weiner for "Justice on Trial: The Lost Generation," "Finding the Lost 
Generation" and "The Walking Wounded"; KRON-TV in San Francisco for "In the 
Shadow of the Wall," and WTVJ-TV in Miami for coverage of Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>

Timor," a half-hour documentary about the massacre of Timorese by Indonesian 
troops in 1991.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; U.S., STATE RELEASE FUNDS FOR RECOVERY; AID: 
MONEY WILL GO FOR HIGHWAYS, SCHOOLS, HOUSING. 'WE DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY 
SLOWDOWN' IN ROAD REPAIRS, FEDERAL OFFICIAL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena released $50 million in 
emergency federal funds Thursday to assist in the demolition and reconstruction 
of damaged freeways -- the largest allocation yet for transportation systems 
crippled by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena's announcement came as state Controller Gray Davis issued $100 million in 
checks for government, transportation, educational and church agencies in Los 
Angeles County and as Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee 
Witt said checks totaling $27.6 million have been disbursed for housing 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The money released by Pena, combined with $45 million made available last 
week, is intended to help state officials continue their freeway rebuilding 
efforts while Congress mulls a $1.35-billion federal allocation for 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caltrans is close to bringing on board construction companies, and we want to 
make sure they don't lose one day of the momentum they have started," Pena said 
in a telephone interview from Washington. "We don't want to see any slowdown in 
the demolition or reconstruction work." 
</P>
<P>
 Pena announced the emergency allocation during a Senate hearing in Washington 
on the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, called by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Pena said 
arrangements were being made to add 25 locomotives and train cars to 
accommodate commuters riding the Metrolink system. Pena said he was also 
working on securing federal waivers to increase the average speed of Metrolink 
trains from 25 m.p.h. to 30 m.p.h. on the route between Palmdale and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena emphasized that the long-term plan to rebuild the Los Angeles area's 
transportation network must include efforts to persuade as many commuters as 
possible to park their cars and use mass transit.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, the Senate Public Works Committee passed on a voice vote 
Boxer's proposal that would make highway bridges eligible for federal funds to 
cover earthquake retrofitting. Under current law, a freeway structure must be 
damaged before it is eligible for federal funds. Although the proposal would 
not set aside any federal money to retrofit California freeways, Boxer called 
it a necessary first step. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials hope to win congressional approval for a $6.6-billion 
aid package by mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said transportation officials are particularly eager for early passage 
because they have nearly exhausted emergency funds for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hopeful that the majority of Congress will recognize the severity of 
the calamity in California and the importance for the nation to once again 
respond to people in need," Pena said. "The fact of the matter is that the 
transportation system in Southern California is crucial to our nation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Baxter, director of Caltrans' rebuilding operations, said the work was 
continuing at a rapid pace. He said detours around freeway bridges that 
collapsed during the earthquake were functioning fairly well, but engineers 
were having to rethink some of their ideas that had produced mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said that on Tuesday, northbound evening commuter traffic routed around 
the shattered interchange of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways in 
Sylmar experienced delays of more than two hours. By Wednesday evening, he 
said, that delay had been trimmed to just 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the big improvement on Wednesday was because of the addition of three 
lanes of traffic -- one that was added to the truck route bypass by re-striping 
and two more that were added by converting the two southbound lanes of Sierra 
Highway into northbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 That worked fine for northbound traffic, he said, but southbound traffic, 
which had to be diverted to other routes, was a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Sierra Highway remained open to traffic in both directions 
Thursday night, and the delays for northbound traffic increased again. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter said re-sequencing of the traffic lights on the surface street detours 
around the disabled Simi Valley and Santa Monica freeways was moving traffic 
through at speeds of up to 25 m.p.h. He said car pools using the special, 
shorter detours around the breaks in the Santa Monica Freeway were getting to 
and from work about 20 minutes faster than those using the other detours. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans will continue to adjust detours around the broken freeways until the 
best possible routes have been found, Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials said a fourth station will open Monday on the newly 
activated commuter line to the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The station, at Vincent Grade on the southern edge of the Antelope Valley, was 
built in four days by a Navy Seabees construction crew, assisted by Los Angeles 
County road crews. Metrolink stations usually take three to six months to 
build, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Schmidt, a FEMA spokeswoman, said 156,273 applications for housing 
aid had been received by telephone and at disaster assistance centers by 
midafternoon Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt said FEMA opened its 20th center, in Pacoima, on Thursday. Another 
center is expected to open today in the Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The checks are going out," Witt said. "We're very proud of that. We've 
speeded the process up. But we still have a lot of need out there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the state checks he issued Thursday included $10 million apiece for 
Cal State Northridge, the Los Angeles Unified School District and the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75,000 customers in the northern San Fernando Valley, the Hollywood 
Hills, the Santa Monica Mountains and Pacific Palisades were still being 
advised to boil their water before drinking it. 
</P>
<P>
 Light rain fell in scattered areas of Los Angeles before dawn Thursday, 
turning portions of the already soggy encampments for earthquake refugees into 
quagmires. 
</P>
<P>
 The population of the five encampments at city parks was gradually shrinking 
as the refugees began straggling back to their homes, but the National Guard 
said 1,869 people were still housed in 176 Army tents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainfall was heavier in Laguna Beach, one of the areas hardest hit by last 
fall's devastating brush fires, and there were mudslides in several canyons 
where the blazes had stripped hillsides of the vegetation needed to prevent 
erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The slides forced the closure of Laguna Canyon Road, one of Laguna Beach's 
principal arteries. Mud and water stood as much as three feet deep in some 
areas, Laguna Beach police said.

A MASTER OF THE FINE ART OF ESCAPE; COURTS: HE BROKE HEARTS AND WALLETS POSING 
AS AN ENGLISH LORD. NOW, AFTER A SECOND HUNG JURY, HE MAY WALK AWAY FROM 
CHARGES OF TRANSPORTING A STOLEN PAINTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The painting is beautiful, even after 350 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rare work by Flemish master David Teniers the Younger was not the only 
reason federal marshals, an FBI agent and a detective from Scotland Yard were 
especially watchful in a Downtown Los Angeles courtroom the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter the Cheater" was in the room too. And the fine art of escape -- not old 
masters' portraits -- was on some people's minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice before when British police caught up with the man calling himself Lord 
Peter Charles de Vere Beauclerk, he had slipped out of their clutches. 
</P>
<P>
 And Thursday in Los Angeles, it appeared that he might have done it again. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, the pretend peer -- who is actually Charles Crutcher Jr. of 
Long Beach -- did not have to punch out detectives or drive madly through a 
hedgerow, among the escapades that won him headlines in the British tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
 All he had to do was sit silently in federal court as frustrated U.S. 
prosecutors twice failed to convict him of illegally transporting stolen 
property -- the painting -- out of the country. Two times in the last two weeks 
juries were unable to reach a verdict on the single count. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer said she may dismiss charges against 
Crutcher, 45. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think two hung juries are enough," Pfaelzer said, though emphasizing that 
she will not make a final decision until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a bitter disappointment to British authorities, who twice flew 
witnesses to Los Angeles in an effort to send Crutcher to federal prison for up 
to 10 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would certainly cooperate if they decide to try him again," Scotland Yard 
Detective Sgt. Richard Ellis said from England, where he returned when jurors 
began deliberating. 
</P>
<P>
 According to authorities, Crutcher was a middle-class American raised in the 
Los Angeles suburb of Lakewood before he surfaced 15 years ago in London, 
cultivating a make-believe title and an upper-class lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 To his Chelsea neighbors, "Lord Peter" was a dignified gentleman who wore 
bowler hats and impeccable suits and carried a neatly furled umbrella when he 
took his Labrador, Hussar, for walks. 
</P>
<P>
 To his friends, he was either a successful international financier who 
belonged to the same polo club as Prince Charles or an investments adviser to 
the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 But to a long string of women swept off their feet and then jilted by 
Crutcher, he was a heartbreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Crutcher was using the name "Charles de Crevecoeur" -- which means 
"broken heart" in French -- when he was arrested in October at a Belmont Shore 
surf shop, where he worked as a $6-per-hour sales clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the two trials in Los Angeles, several former girlfriends from England 
and the United States testified against Crutcher as authorities sought to tie 
him to the 8 1/2-by-6-inch Teniers oil painting, titled "A Peasant Filling His 
Pipe," that disappeared from a British art gallery in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the painting reappeared last year when Crutcher shipped it 
from his Long Beach home to another London gallery in hopes of selling it for 
$150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 When the gallery owner discovered the Teniers was stolen, he notified police. 
Investigators from Scotland Yard were stunned to learn that Crutcher was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a familiar figure to them -- and to readers of British tabloids, which 
years earlier had headlined the exploits of "Lord Peter the Cheater." 
</P>
<P>
 Crutcher earned that nickname after several women accused him of wooing them 
and then leaving them and a string of debts. At the time, he was married to a 
British woman and was the father of a 3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 His notoriety only increased when he allegedly escaped twice from British 
police trying to question him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fake Lord Fought His Way Out of Police Clutches," trumpeted the London Daily 
Telegraph after he fled the first time in 1978. While London detectives were 
taking him to a police station, he persuaded them to let him stop first at his 
flat to change clothes. There, "he assaulted both detectives, knocking one 
unconscious, and escaped," according to the Telegraph account. 
</P>
<P>
 The second getaway came the next year, when police located him at a pub near 
Oxford. Crutcher was said to have bolted from the tavern, jumped into a rented 
car and driven through a rhododendron hedge to avoid police who were blocking 
the pub's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 He was eventually caught and jailed for assault and for defrauding one of his 
girlfriends, according to British records. But several years later, he 
resurfaced as a British judge's personal assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Crutcher was back in the news in 1986 when he was hired by Sir Gervase 
Sheldon, a High Court judge, after claiming to be a London law student. He had 
"conned his way there" by posing as a graduate of Oxford University, reported 
the News of the World tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ellis, Crutcher was being sought by British authorities on 
charges of "deceit" and shoplifting from Harrod's when he dropped out of sight 
in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out he had returned to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Crutcher's new California friends later described him as an articulate, 
athletic man. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he'd worked in the financial market in Europe," said John Griff, a 
Long Beach real estate agent who became Crutcher's roommate after they met as 
competitors at a triathlon. "It struck me as odd he was working as a store 
clerk, especially for a man of his intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach resident Pam Endicott, a waitress at a Belmont Shore bistro where 
Crutcher was a regular, recalled how "he never talked about himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Crutcher was arrested Oct. 19 at the Shore Sports shop, where he had worked 
for two years, after Scotland Yard enlisted the FBI's help in the stolen 
painting case. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his past escapes, Crutcher was held without bail at the 
Metropolitan Detention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 British authorities, aware that their charges were too minor to warrant 
extradition proceedings, did all they could to help U.S. officials convict 
Crutcher -- even locating one witness on a remote island off Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the first trial ended Jan. 13 with a hung jury, the panel 
leaning 11 to 1 for conviction, according to one member. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, authorities returned three British witnesses -- along with several 
of Crutcher's former American girlfriends -- to testify in the second trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Crutcher did not take the stand either time and his colorful past was not 
discussed in court. His lawyers, public defenders Neison Marks and Frederick 
Lacey, also declined to let him be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 His defense was that his father had given him the painting and that he had no 
idea it was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 An FBI agent testified that Crutcher, when arrested, insisted that his late 
father, a former South Gate High School graphic arts instructor, had purchased 
it for $29,500 in 1986 -- even though the painting was not reported stolen 
until the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him how his father saved enough money as a teacher to buy this fine 
painting and he said his father 'hoarded money,' " agent Virginia Curry told 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At each trial, the testimony was over and done with in little more than a day, 
sticking to the basics of the attempted sale of the 17th-Century painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Pfaelzer ordered jurors at the second trial not to discuss their 
deliberations. But Jack Hooper, a Highland Park resident who served on the 
first panel, said the one holdout juror was "hung up on the value of the 
painting and the possibility of others being involved." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the majority, who wanted to convict Crutcher, were puzzled by the 
lack of the information they got, Hooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd sure like to have known the background of the guy," he said.

DOCTOR FILES BIAS SUIT OVER LOSING KEY KING HOSPITAL JOB; COURTS: OFFICIALS SAY 
DR. WILLIAM SHOEMAKER WAS REASSIGNED BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS IN KEEPING 
ACCREDITATION.

<P>
 Almost 30 years ago, when Martin Luther King Jr. was leading his historic 
march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., the legendary civil rights leader needed 
medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 A young white physician who had come from Chicago to join the protest was 
summoned to care for King. He was Dr. William Shoemaker, and although he rarely 
discusses the matter nowadays, his eyes still water at the recollection. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker, 70, is an internationally renowned pioneer in the field of 
intensive care who has spent his life in teaching hospitals that serve the poor 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But now he is now engaged in a civil rights struggle that he never envisioned. 
He is fighting to keep his job, a top post at the South-Central Los Angeles 
hospital that bears King's name -- the Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center. The legal shield he is using in an unusual lawsuit filed against the 
hospital is the Ku Klux Klan Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never dreamed that I would find myself, at this stage of my career, 
involved in a lawsuit to save my reputation and good name and resist what I 
believe to be fundamental unfairness and discrimination against me based upon 
my race and my age," Shoemaker said in a court declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was abruptly ordered to resign last month as chairman of the 
emergency department, Shoemaker filed a Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit 
charging that hospital officials acted out of racial and age bias as well as in 
retaliation for his apparent whistle-blowing. A hearing is scheduled today. 
Medical center officials denied the allegations and said Shoemaker was merely 
reassigned with no cut in his $164,000-a-year salary. They say they acted in 
response to an accrediting agency's report that questioned Shoemaker's 
credentials and found major deficiencies in the emergency department's training 
program for resident doctors. Within the next few weeks, the agency will decide 
whether to revoke the program's accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Reed Tuckson, president of the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and 
Science, said Shoemaker had to be reassigned because the accrediting agency is 
requiring that the emergency room chairman be a board-certified emergency 
specialist -- and Shoemaker is not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have spent my life fighting for human equality and I resent these 
allegations (of discrimination)," Tuckson said in an interview. "They are not 
only untrue, they are unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker assumed the post in 1991 after a nationwide search for a permanent 
chairman of the emergency department, which had been without a leader for about 
nine years.  
</P>
<P>
 His recruitment was viewed as a coup for a hospital that had struggled to 
attract good doctors. Shoemaker's resume is 36 pages long, listing about 400 
articles in scholarly journals, as well as a leading textbook on critical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker alleges that he was demoted without good cause from a post that he 
was entitled to hold for six years and that carried an extra stipend that has 
now been withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for Shoemaker's resignation came Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker contends in his lawsuit that the move was prompted in part by a 
perception within the hospital that he is a whistle-blower who had provided 
information to the district attorney's office and the Los Angeles Times about 
the death of Deputy Sheriff Nelson Yamamoto. The rookie deputy died at the 
hospital in 1992 after surgery on gunshot wounds. The Times reported Nov. 15 
that his death is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuckson said Shoemaker's dismissal resulted exclusively from the November 
report by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education threatening 
to shut down the emergency department's training program for 42 resident 
doctors, who provide the bulk of the patients' care. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency criticized the hospital's treatment facilities and supervision of 
residents by senior physicians. It noted that more than half of the 13 
supervising doctors, including Shoemaker, are not certified as emergency 
specialists and that three of the certified doctors only work one shift per 
week supervising patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency acknowledged that Shoemaker is an excellent surgeon but said he has 
limited experience in emergency medicine. Shoemaker disputed that, saying he 
has worked in emergency departments or interacted with them for 30 years in 
Chicago, New York City and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of saving the residency training program, county health services 
official Walter Gray said the hospital is hiring several physicians to bring 
the number of certified emergency specialists to 14. He also said a national 
search has been launched for a new chairman who must be an emergency 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the department will be run temporarily by a certified emergency 
specialist, Dr. H. Range Hutson, 44, who is in charge of the main admitting 
area of the emergency department at County-USC Medical Center. Hutson is a 
graduate of Stanford University and UC Davis School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the emergency departments at teaching hospitals nationwide are headed 
by certified specialists in emergency medicine, which is a newer field than, 
for example, surgery or internal medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The largest emergency department in the country, at County-USC Medical Center, 
is headed by Dr. Gail Anderson, who is not a certified specialist. But he said 
he is viewed as having the equivalent qualifications, partly because he founded 
the department. He said his successor at County-USC will undoubtedly be 
certified as an emergency specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Shoemaker, Anderson said: "I like him. I respect him. But it was a mistake" 
that the hospital named him emergency department chairman in 1991 because he is 
not an emergency medicine specialist. He said Shoemaker's removal was 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Mohamed Parsa, director of the trauma center at Harlem Hospital in New 
York City, said there is "no question about Dr. Shoemaker's abilities and 
qualifications . . . To be disgraced with this kind of dismissal after he's 
given his life to humanity and to medicine is terrible." Parsa described 
Shoemaker as an unusually truthful man who sometimes offends people with his 
honesty. "People gang up on him," Parsa said, "so he has had to pick up and 
run" from one hospital to the next like a "scientific gypsy." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker said he has moved where opportunities present themselves, devoting 
most of his medical career to exploring new methods for boosting survival rates 
among acutely ill or injured patients. He joined the department of surgery at 
King in 1986 with the hopes of improving survival rates among patients with 
gunshot wounds and other severe trauma. He said he wants to stay at King to 
complete his work and energize the younger residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am fighting for my position because much more than a position is at stake 
-- fundamental fairness, 48 years of work, and my good name, which is being 
destroyed," Shoemaker said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, when he was setting up the first organized trauma center at Cook 
County Hospital in Chicago, he heard the news that marchers in Selma had been 
attacked by police dogs on "Bloody Sunday." The doctor packed his bags and 
headed to Alabama with one of his sons, then 9 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 March organizers immediately selected Shoemaker as part of a doctor squad to 
be ready in case violence broke out. As it happened, there was no violence, but 
King needed minor medical attention. It was Shoemaker's privilege, he recalled, 
to provide care. Afterward, he met and talked with King on many occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It breaks his heart to be filing a lawsuit against an institution named after 
Martin Luther King Jr.," said Shoemaker's attorney, Rees Lloyd. "But we both 
feel we'd be hypocrites if we didn't."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; COURTS 
STRUGGLING TO REBUILD LEGAL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With one courthouse condemned and another undergoing major repairs following 
the Northridge earthquake, officials in the San Fernando Valley are struggling 
with the daunting task of reconstructing a battered legal system. 
</P>
<P>
 The courthouse in San Fernando, which houses 12 Superior Court judges, 
suffered extensive damage during the Jan. 17 temblor and is expected to be 
unusable for most of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said a year, and if it's sooner, be grateful," said Judge Judith M. 
Ashmann who supervises San Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Most operations will move to the Van Nuys courthouse by next Wednesday, 
although that facility sustained some damage and only five of seven floors are 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 Also closed are the Santa Monica Superior and Municipal courts, which are 
expected to reopen Monday, and the Calabasas branch of the Malibu Judicial 
District. Matters from the branch will be handled in Malibu. Newhall Municipal 
Court is open for criminal matters only.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; MAN LINKED TO 
PHOTOS OF MOLESTED CHILD GETS 20 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man linked to photographs of a 4-year-old molestation victim was sentenced 
Thursday to 20 years in prison for lewd conduct. As part of a plea bargain, 
however, authorities dropped child pornography charges against Paul Lynn Loe, 
46, of Rowland Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Loe pleaded no contest earlier this month to eight charges of lewd acts on a 
child in connection with the molestation of a girl. Three additional counts 
against Loe of lewd conduct and five counts of child pornography were 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Low, the father of three, had faced a maximum sentence of 29 years if 
convicted on all counts. He was arrested in late December after pictures of a 
young girl being molested were found in a trash bin behind a Whittier hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 When a cropped version of one photo showing the victim's face appeared on 
television, the girl was identified, leading police to Loe. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his girlfriend shared a Rowland Heights apartment unit with the girl 
and her mother, and he occasionally baby-sat the child.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GARDENER CONVICTED OF 
MURDER IN SLAYING OF ELDERLY EMPLOYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A South-Central Los Angeles man was convicted Thursday of murder in the 
stabbing death of a 78-year-old woman who was affectionately known to her 
neighbors as "Miss Baby Ruth." 
</P>
<P>
 Huey Ferguson, 35, is expected to be sentenced March 3 to life without the 
possibility of parole in the Jan., 22, 1993, slaying of Ruth Isabel Roberts in 
her home in the 700 block of West 73rd Street.Ferguson worked as a part-time 
gardener for Roberts, who had lived at the address for 55 years and got her 
nickname because she often handed out candy to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Renee Cartaya said there was no direct evidence linking 
Ferguson to the crime, but that one witness saw him jump over the front fence 
into Roberts' yard before she was killed. Another witness originally told 
police that he later saw Ferguson jump over the victim's back fence into an 
alley with her small television set, then overheard him confess the crime to 
his mother. But that witness, John Atkins, recanted those statements at 
Ferguson's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartaya showed the jury a videotape of Atkins making the original statement, 
however, and the panel apparently believed what he said then. The prosecutor 
speculated that Atkins had recanted because of "family pressures." He lives 
with one of Ferguson's nieces, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson also was convicted of residential robbery and residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts' body was discovered by neighbors, who became concerned when they 
could not reach her. ANDREA FORD

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; JUDGE 
BLOCKS PROPOSAL TO ERECT STREET BARRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court Judge on Thursday blocked Long Beach from erecting a 
controversial street barrier between an upscale housing tract and the city of 
Hawaiian Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 The fence -- which would have blocked off Pioneer Boulevard at the border of 
Hawaiian Gardens and the El Dorado Park Estates in East Long Beach -- was 
approved by the Long Beach City Council in December.Traffic studies showed that 
the residential streets were overused, city officials said, probably by 
commuters seeking access to the San Gabriel River Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But some neighborhood residents and Hawaiian Gardens council members protested 
and, in a suit filed Thursday, opponents alleged the gate was intended to keep 
lower-income, minority motorists out of the El Dorado area. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne issued a temporary restraining 
order that will remain in effect until Feb. 18, when a preliminary injunction 
hearing is scheduled.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; ST. 
JOHN'S HOSPITAL TO RAZE QUAKE-DAMAGED WING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica, which was forced to 
evacuate all its patients after the Northridge earthquake, announced Thursday 
that it would tear down one wing that has been badly damaged and rebuild 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Miereanu, a spokesman for the hospital, said St. John's expects to be 
fully operational by August, although some hospital operations, such as the 
radiation unit, will be phased in before that. St. John's is still not able to 
accept patients for overnight stays, but is operating its outpatient 
facilities, Miereanu said. 
</P>
<P>
 The north wing, which will be torn down, was built in 1951. It included an 
obstetrics ward, a nursery and a chemical dependency unit. Other hospital 
buildings were not damaged as badly and can be rebuilt or repaired.

CHURCH NEWSPAPER ACCUSED OF BLOCKING AD ON PRIEST ABUSE; CONFERENCE: 
MOLESTATION VICTIMS SAY THE TIDINGS QUASHED THE NOTICE AFTER THREE WEEKS OF 
INDECISION. THE ARCHDIOCESE BLAMES THE QUAKE, COMPUTER PROBLEMS. 
</P>

<P>
 As victims of sexual abuse by priests prepared to open a national meeting in 
Los Angeles today, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles found itself 
in the midst of a controversy over why a paid advertisement announcing the 
conference failed to appear in its newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the meeting held a news conference Thursday in front of Cardinal 
Roger M. Mahony's office complaining that their ad had been quashed. 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese said it agreed to print the ad in the Tidings newspaper after 
several weeks of indecision, but that due to either a missed deadline or a 
computer error, the ad never made the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident marked the second time in recent months that the Tidings 
newspaper has failed to run an advertisement involving sexual abuse by priests. 
Last March, the archdiocese banned an ad for a new novel on priest pedophilia 
by Father Andrew Greeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that their excuses are the real reasons that the ad did not 
run," survivors network founder and President Barbara Blaine charged. "The real 
reason . . . is they're afraid to admit this really is a problem in this 
archdiocese and that somehow if they were to print the ad they would be 
admitting that this is a problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the survivors group tried to place the ad for more than three weeks. 
Each time members were told they had missed a deadline or that the ad needed 
approval from an official of the archdiocese. Then she said they were told the 
text was unacceptable. Finally, they were told the ad would run -- only to 
receive a letter from the newspaper saying that due to a computer error the ad 
did not appear. An uncashed check for $12 was returned to the group. 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of policy, the archdiocese must approve all new ads proposed for 
publication, according to Father Gregory Coiro, archdiocesan spokesman. But 
during part of January, he said, Mahony and his auxiliary bishops were away on 
a retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Tod Tamberg, editor of the Tidings, said Thursday: "My understanding is that 
the problem was that the process took such a long time that by the time (the 
ad) got back to us the deadline had already passed. It wasn't a cover-up or 
trying to deny them any voice in the Tidings. It was just something that 
happened in the channels that was unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Terrance L. Fleming, vice chancellor of the archdiocese, said he gave 
final approval to the ad last week after speaking with Mahony. He added that to 
his knowledge the text was not changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamberg also said the Tidings' computer was knocked out by the Jan. 17 
earthquake and that a number of ads could not be retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference is scheduled to begin today at the Marina International Hotel 
in Marina del Rey and run through Sunday.

RON HARRIS: 'COACH' LEFT BEHIND A LONG LIST OF WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just about all the players were there -- politicians, entrepreneurs, 
celebrities and community activists, scrunched elbow-to-elbow in the sanctuary 
of Chip Murray's First African Methodist Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an impressive gathering: Maxine Waters, Gwen Moore, Johnnie Cochran, 
Bernard Kinsey, Danny Bakewell, Bondie Gambrell, Walt Hazzard, Brenda Richie 
(Lionel's ex), Chilton Alphonse, Diane Watson, Ron Burkle, Jim Harrick, Kerman 
Maddox, Nate Holden, Tom Bradley, Sweet Alice, Mark Ridley-Thomas, John Mack, 
Walter Tucker III, Larkin Arnold, Larry McCormick, Carlton Jenkins, David 
Cunningham . . . and the list goes on to the tune of some 2,000 souls. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had dropped a bomb in there, you'd just about have wiped out all the 
black leadership in Los Angeles," observed Kinsey.  
</P>
<P>
 They had come to say goodby to a little man whose enormous heart gave out on 
him in Washington the same day that the earth shook here. He died just moments 
after he had visited with Vice President Al Gore and minutes before he was to 
meet with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 To most, he was known as Fox. Others called him Coach. His real name was Fred 
Snowden. Doesn't ring a bell, does it? But that's kind of the way Fred played 
it. He touched, he moved, he molded, he motivated. But he never sought credit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't really know Snowden that well. I met him last summer at the rehearsal 
of somebody's fund-raiser. Bored, I noticed this dapper guy sitting all alone 
by the entrance puffing on a cigarette. I joined him. 
</P>
<P>
 We talked about hometowns and kids and community concerns and somewhere along 
the way he mentioned casually that he used to coach basketball. He skipped the 
part about being the nation's first black head basketball coach of a major 
college when he was at the University of Arizona and being named NCAA Coach of 
the Year. And I guess it slipped his mind that he is a legend in Detroit, where 
his high school teams won an astounding 207 games against six losses, including 
seven consecutive Detroit Public League championships. 
</P>
<P>
 I just knew that I liked him. He seemed honest and extremely committed to 
helping people. So I asked him for his card. Executive Director, Food 4 Less 
Foundation, it read. 
</P>
<P>
 What does that mean? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we give money to various organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 Like who? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, sometime next week we're going to give some money to the school system 
to help them a little with their athletic program. That way they can put more 
of their money into academics." 
</P>
<P>
 Really, I said, rather nonplussed. How much? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten million dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that everybody has a Fred Snowden story. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbur Tate was wandering aimlessly through life, having squandered a college 
education and basketball career, until Snowden, for whom he had never played, 
put him on the path to an undergraduate degree, a master's and his first job -- 
field representative for Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle that I'm here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of Ernest Arceneaux, now a senior field deputy for state Sen. Diane 
Watson, was balancing precariously on a mini-mall he had developed on Broadway 
and Slauson when Fred Snowden happened by. He had only one tenant until 
Snowden, then a Baskin Robbins vice president, rescued his family investment by 
placing a black-owned franchise there. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin Franklin of the Temptations had been kicked out of school for singing 
in the hallways when his coach, Snowden, walked him through the downtown school 
board and got him back in class with the caveat that he would no longer play 
basketball. And when they tried to boot Franklin out again for going to New 
York to record his first LP, there was Coach to save him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was like a father to me, to so many of us," Franklin said. "I think he was 
one of God's own angels." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. William Harvey, president of Hampton University and Snowden's cousin, had 
for years tried to pay back the money Snowden would stuff into his pocket every 
payday when Harvey was broke in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd always say: 'Bill, I don't need it,' " Harvey recalled. "Pass it on to 
somebody who does." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Sweet Alice, a Watts community activist, had the best remembrance of 
Snowden. She noted during the memorial service how in a scant 12 years after 
his arrival in Los Angeles, Snowden had ascended the corporate and political 
hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he never forgot us down in Watts. He never was ashamed of us. He was 
always there for us." He was always trying to pass it on.

UCLA PICKS INTERIM HEAD FOR CHICANO STUDIES; EDUCATION: SOME ACTIVISTS 
CRITICIZE APPOINTMENT OF ADMINISTRATOR WHO HELPED NEGOTIATE END TO HUNGER 
STRIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA officials announced Thursday that an administrator who helped negotiate 
an end to the highly publicized campus hunger strike last year would serve as 
interim director of the new Cesar Chavez Center for Chicana and Chicano 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 But two of the hunger strikers called the move a halfhearted attempt to blunt 
accusations that the university was not moving quickly enough to honor its 
agreement with Chicano activists to open the center and hire faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Grijalva, associate dean for honors and undergraduate programs, said 
Thursday that his appointment underscored the "urgency to get the center off 
the ground" but added that he expected to only hold the job until a permanent 
replacement is chosen by July. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really felt that it was important to get somebody who is in the field" of 
Chicano studies, said Grijalva, an associate professor of psychology whose 
specialty is the brain's relationship to stress and psychosomatic disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Grijalva helped negotiate an end to a 14-day hunger strike staged 
by nine students, professors and community members in reaction to an 
announcement by Chancellor Charles E. Young that the school's interdisciplinary 
Chicano studies program would not be upgraded to an academic department, as 
Latino activists had demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Grijalva helped end the impasse by consolidating support for demonstrators' 
demands among administrative colleagues, who in turn helped persuade Young to 
approve a compromise establishing an independent Chicano studies center by 
September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Grijalva's helpful role, UCLA anatomy professor Jorge Mancillas and 
UCLA student Marcos Aguilar criticized his appointment Thursday as an 
indication that UCLA was taking only partial, inadequate steps to create the 
center, which was supposed to be up and running nearly four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar, a sixth-year senior who also participated in last year's hunger 
strike, accused UCLA administrators of "playing games with . . . the whole 
struggle" because, as an administrator, Grijalva would be obligated to defend 
the Administration in the face of further demands from students or the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're using his Mexican last name and yet they know he is an 
administrator," Aguilar said. "They are trying to shut people up like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Grijalva, however, said he intends to push ahead with plans to hire four 
faculty members to work exclusively for the center. He said a trickle of 
applications has come in so far but he expects more interest before the Feb. 15 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of faculty members specifically to teach at the new center was a 
key issue in last year's compromise. Activists complained that the traditional 
program, which at one point was in danger of termination, lacked direction and 
status. The interdisciplinary approach favored by Young offered an 18-course 
curriculum -- three or four classes a semester -- taught by professors from 
different departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators wanted Young to create a separate Chicano studies department, a 
more prestigious designation that confers the power to hire faculty and shape a 
coherent curriculum. The compromise didn't go that far, but UCLA administrators 
say the center will function like a department all the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Grijalva said Thursday that hiring the four professors would allow the center 
to nearly double UCLA's Chicano studies course offerings, perhaps by next fall.

MAN DIES AS FIRE SWEEPS CARE HOME; TRAGEDY: OTHER RESIDENTS OF FACILITY FOR 
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY DISABLED ESCAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 34-year-old man was killed Thursday night when a fire swept through the 
first floor of a board-and-care home for the mentally and physically disabled, 
firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose family lives outside California, was found in a first-floor 
bathroom of Christian Residential Care, Westminster Fire Capt. Craig Campbell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other disabled adults who lived in the home were evacuated without harm. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire, which did $275,000 damage, is under investigation, 
Campbell said. "There's nothing left there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said firefighters received a call from a caretaker at 6:50 p.m. and 
could see a column of smoke rising from the two-story house from their 
Westminster fire station more than a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of 20 firefighters extinguished the blaze in 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The leased facility, in the 15700 block of Candlewood Street, has been 
operated for four years by Rita Mills, 51, who said she was "in shock." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the two resident caretakers in the home told firefighters he was 
upstairs when a smoke alarm went off. As he came down the stairs, he said, he 
saw the back of the house on fire and grabbed the first resident he saw and 
pulled him outside.  
</P>
<P>
 When he went back into the seven-bedroom house, the caretaker said, he was 
stopped by a wall of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Other staff members got the two remaining residents out. 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth resident who is physically disabled had left earlier in the day to 
spend the weekend with family. 
</P>
<P>
 Melody Psigan, 24, Mills' daughter, said she was out having her nails done 
when the fire started. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the victim, who was mentally disabled, liked to listen to music and 
watch television. He was "a very happy guy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills said the victim had been at the home for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was already like my son," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Suzara, operator of a boarding house two doors away from where the fire 
occurred, was housing two of the adults who had to evacuate Thursday night. The 
men, who are in their 40s, had gone to bed before the fire. They fled the home 
in their underwear with help from the staff, Suzara said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were shaken, and one of them kept trying to leave Suzara's home to 
return to the board-and-care facility. The other residents of the facility were 
taken to a board-and-care home in Garden Grove.  
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Heimer, who lives next door to the facility, said that when her dog 
barked, "I walked between the two houses and all you could see was flames and 
black smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Heimer said the residents were quiet and well dressed, and appeared to be well 
cared for.

POPULAR VIETNAM SINGER WANTS TO REMAIN IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of Vietnam's most popular singers, whose appearance in Orange County this 
month provoked strong criticism, announced Thursday on a live radio program 
that she wants to remain in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanh Lan said in a brief, tearful interview on Saigon Radio in San Jose that 
she is in this country on a three-month cultural visa arranged by Congressman 
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) and that the visa specifically forbids 
extensions. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she wanted to stay, but did not use the word asylum.  
</P>
<P>
 Lan, 45, could not be reached for comment later. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Hollingsworth, Rohrabacher's district director in Huntington Beach, 
said she handled Lan's visa as a "routine matter," based on a request from a 
constituent to help Lan appear at a Little Saigon movie premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the provisions of the visa, Hollingsworth said, Lan promised not to ask 
to stay in the United States after the 90-day visa expired. If Lan stays longer 
than 90 days, Hollingsworth said, the case would have to be handled by the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service before Rohrabacher could intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 But Congressman Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) said his office is willing 
"to start the long, laborious process" of helping Lan apply for political 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a tape of some of her songs and she is a beautiful singer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan emphasized that Lan is not a special case. "We try to help every 
Vietnamese family who asks us to intervene," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lan, who also is a well-known movie actress, "loves to be here because it's a 
free country," said Louie Do, a news producer at Saigon Radio and Vien Thal TV 
in San Jose, who was present at the interview. "She would like to stay in the 
United States to pursue her acting career." 
</P>
<P>
 The five-minute interview was simulcast in Orange County on Little Saigon 
Radio at 2:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Co D.L. Pham, president of the Vietnamese American Chamber of Commerce in 
Garden Grove, said he was not surprised when he heard Lan's announcement on the 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Vietnamese want to be in the U.S., in a free country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pham suggested than Lan's announcement could have been prompted by other 
motives. "Maybe she was scared because extremists were threatening her," he 
said. "She is alone here, with no protection." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lan visited Orange County in early January to promote her new film, "Tinh 
Nguoi" (Human Emotion), she was criticized by local Vietnamese newspapers who 
called her a Communist tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Lan, a popular entertainer in Saigon during the Vietnam War, denied that she 
was a supporter of the Communist government and said that she repeatedly tried 
to escape after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Orange County, Lan stopped by Rohrabacher's office to thank him for 
his assistance, and to discuss the artistic constraints placed on artists in 
authoritarian regimes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the film's premiere, Lan told angry questioners that she did not intend to 
live in the United States, because she could live very well in Vietnam on what 
she earned. She did not discuss reports that she is now married to a government 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unfair to dub her as Communist sympathizer," said a prominent 
member of the Little Saigon community, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
"I'm embarrassed. It's ridiculous, but typical of some elements of the 
community. They want to turn the clock back 30 years. . . . I feel so sorry. . 
. . She has a lots of fans here, she's very popular, she's educated . . . comes 
from a good family." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a small protest at the Vietnamese-language theater where the film 
opened, but the turnout for the opening was light and the run was short. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's plot touched a nerve in Little Saigon, according to interviews with 
community leaders. It told the story of a wealthy Vietnamese American physician 
who is betrayed by his materialistic wife. In despair, he returns to Vietnam to 
work in a hospital, where he meets and falls in love with a doctor who has 
returned from exile in France. In one scene, the partially clad couple make 
love on the bed of the last emperor of Vietnam, Bao Dai, who is still revered 
by many Vietnamese expatriates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her agenda is playing that role," said Louie Do, the San Jose news producer. 
"She had nothing to do with the Communist agenda at all." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Lan also claimed that, as a result of the controversy over the 
film, local nightclub owners in Little Saigon refused to let her perform.  
</P>
<P>
 Her radio interview Thursday was to promote a concert tonight at the San Jose 
Convention Center. That appearance has been equally controversial, provoking a 
march and protest by 500 people in San Jose last weekend.

FEDERAL COURTHOUSE GETS SENATE AUTHORIZATION; APPROPRIATION: THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE APPROVES $123 MILLION FOR A 348,000-SQUARE-FOOT 
FACILITY IN SANTA ANA THAT WILL PROVIDE MUCH-NEEDED SPACE FOR 15 JUDGES.

<P>
 Hoping to boost the local economy and accommodate an increase in court 
caseloads in Southern California, a U.S. Senate committee on Thursday 
authorized spending $123 million to build a new federal courthouse here. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee effectively 
clears the way for construction, which was stalled last year when Vice 
President Al Gore's plan to "reinvent government" called for an evaluation of 
all planned federal courthouses to see if they were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The action will provide California with badly needed facilities to meet the 
rising tide of crime and the unfortunate consequences of the economy," said 
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who sits on the public works committee. "An 
added benefit to the taxpayers will be from moving federal employees out of 
leased space." 
</P>
<P>
 The new courthouse will be named after former President Ronald Reagan and 
located on four acres of donated city land near the Orange County Civic Center. 
The committee's authorization was $20 million higher than the amount approved 
by the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten judges for the district and bankruptcy courts, as well as their staffs, 
are now housed in the crowded Santa Ana Federal Building and a temporary 
structure on Santa Ana Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal court is so small that many criminal and civil cases have to be 
sent to the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles at a substantial inconvenience 
to local attorneys and their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The 348,000-square-foot building, which was initiated with the help of Rep. 
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), will provide space for 14 courtrooms and 15 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer said the building will also provide office space allowing other federal 
agencies such as the U.S. attorney's office to move out of leased facilities at 
a savings of about $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A groundbreaking ceremony has been scheduled for July 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Original plans for the new Santa Ana courthouse called for a $168-million 
facility, but the Clinton Administration's efforts to streamline government 
pared $45 million off the final authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the funding reduction, the building is almost the same size as 
originally planned, except that it will have one less floor and fewer parking 
spaces and be less opulent than other federal courthouses already built. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the new courthouse had become a matter of contention between Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, 
and Cox, who has told supporters that he plans to seek Feinstein's Senate seat 
this year. Cox helped initiate the new courthouse when he served on the House 
Committee on Public Works and Transportation.

RED, WHITE AND REWARDING; O.C. RED CROSS VOLUNTEERS ARE AIDING NORTHRIDGE QUAKE 
VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The powerful aftershock ripped through the temporary Red Cross shelter here, 
sending hundreds of terrified earthquake refugees bolting for the door. Carol 
Beuschlein, a 20-year Red Cross veteran from Westminster, heard a shelter 
worker yell, "Cut them off at the pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Calmly surveying the panic around her, Beuschlein began to circulate among the 
mostly Spanish-speaking evacuees, reassuring them that there was no danger of 
the building collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to keep the people in, because we were afraid that they would break 
through the glass door," Beuschlein said Thursday, recounting the incident that 
occurred just two days after the devastating Northridge quake. "I found a 
little girl who I nicknamed 'Mickey' because she was wearing a Mickey Mouse 
shirt, to translate and tell people that everything was OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Beuschlein, a 37-year-old former ambulance driver, is among the dozens of Red 
Cross volunteers dispatched from Orange County to operate one of the busiest 
earthquake shelters in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 While relief operations were at their peak, the volunteers typically logged 
12- and 14-hour shifts. Some even gave up their vacations so they could get the 
time off from work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day of the quake, I called the Orange County chapter and they said they 
needed me," said Tom Sipe, 37, an operations coordinator at John Wayne Airport. 
"I walked into work and told them I needed to go and they said it was OK as 
long as I took vacation time." 
</P>
<P>
 Sipe has worked as an assistant to shelter manager John Kulla, a 31-year-old 
chef from Anaheim, since the day after the quake. When Sipe's shift ends, he 
spends the night at a Los Angeles-area hotel until it is time for him to return 
to his shelter duties the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "A vacation is for doing something you like to do, and to me that means 
helping others," Sipe said. "Even if I couldn't have gotten the time off, I 
would have come out here and worked on the weekends." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Red Cross policy of mutual aid, whenever a major disaster becomes 
more than a local chapter can handle, volunteers are sent from all over the 
country. Volunteers have come from as far away as Colorado and Louisiana to 
help Northridge quake victims, their red and white emergency vehicles packed 
with first-aid kits and other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the San Fernando Recreation Center on Park Avenue, now converted into an 
evacuation site, is operated almost entirely by Orange County volunteers -- 
many of whom began arriving just hours after the quake. Like Beuschlein, many 
believe it was only God's will -- or sheer luck -- that kept the disaster from 
striking closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they feel it is their duty to help those who found themselves homeless 
simply because of the accident of geography. 
</P>
<P>
 For the volunteers, it has been a rewarding, albeit exhausting, experience. On 
one night last week, more than 1,100 evacuees were at the shelter, sleeping on 
cots inside the gym. More than two dozen Orange County residents have worked at 
this site, which was "adopted" by the county's Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 In one day alone last week, volunteers served 4,000 meals. They struggled to 
maintain order amid a sea of shattered nerves, monitoring the distribution of 
drinking water, blankets and toys for the children. They provided a sympathetic 
shoulder for people who had lost loved ones and had nowhere else to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy came in one day last week and his girlfriend had been killed in the 
apartment building in Northridge," said Muriel Bagley, a volunteer from 
Huntington Beach. "He just kept saying, 'I have to keep busy, I have to keep 
busy.' I talked to him for a little while. It's just so sad, it makes you want 
to cry." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, nearly 300 people who had spent the night -- afraid or unable to 
return to their homes -- bombarded shelter volunteers with requests for 
assistance. "Do you have anything to eat?" "Can you tell me where the FEMA 
office is?" "Do you have any teddy bears left for my children?" 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a converted gymnasium overflowing with cots where many had spent the 
previous night, families huddled together in small groups. Others crowded in 
front of a small television set, while countless other weary, disheveled 
evacuees lined up to collect their lunch ration of corned beef hash, peaches, 
bread and soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest responsibility has fallen on Kulla's shoulders. As shelter 
manager, it is he who must order the food and other provisions and enforce the 
shelter rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Kulla, another longtime Red Cross volunteer, first joined up in his native 
Spain and has worked major disasters from hurricanes in Europe to the 
earthquake in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it didn't hit Orange County this time. But it could have," Kulla said, 
explaining his reasons for becoming a volunteer. "And if it did, they'd be 
doing this for us instead of the other way around."

DANA PARSONS: PSYCHICS' BOSS HAS A VISION OF BIG PROFITS IN HIS FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I don't like to use Vic ," says Vic Tomborino, almost brand-new to this 
psychic reading business in Laguna Hills. Come to think of it, I probably 
should have asked him why he doesn't like it. Probably would have been an 
interesting story. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we got right down to the psychic business, which Tomborino began last 
year in a storefront next door to a beauty parlor and 7-Eleven on La Paz Road. 
Tomborino, 33 and a Philadelphia native, made it clear he wasn't crazy about 
being interviewed but thought, what the heck, it might help business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hired some guys to hand out flyers, and some people just crushed the flyers 
and said, 'This is real bad work you do.' I imagine they were sort of 
prejudiced against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Any conversation with Tomborino probably would be fun, because he's retained 
his East Coast dialect and almost a schoolboy's openness about this brave new 
adventure that he hopes will mushroom into the big time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is it so popular today, is that what you're asking?" he says as we sit in 
his shop. "People need it, I believe. People really like it. A lot of ladies, 
men, they come in and they have a reading for whatever, a half-hour, 20 
minutes, five minutes, they come in and they tell me one thing, 'Is this going 
to happen? Is that going to happen?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I say, but why do they want to know? "I don't know why," he says. "I 
guess part of what's really going on is that on television with all this 1-800 
and 1-900 psychic stuff, it's word-by-mouth. Someone says, 'This psychic put me 
on the right track.' A psychic helped this person or that one. It's like if you 
go to a doctor, you tell somebody, 'This doctor really cured me, do you need a 
doctor?' so you go to him. This is what it's about, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tomborino says the city has been "great," the council only recently 
voted, 4-1, to allow fortune-telling within its limits. The city had been 
banning fortunetelling for pay, based on an outdated county zoning code, but 
had to update its municipal code because the state Supreme Court has ruled that 
such bans were unconstitutional. Councilman Randal J. Bressette noted that such 
businesses sometimes have acquired bad reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeming oblivious to political swirling, Tomborino says, "First of all, if a 
person has a problem with drinking or some young kids with drugs and they don't 
want to tell their parents, they would come in here and ask for advice. You 
always listen to advice but do you know if it's right or wrong? It's free to 
listen to someone's advice, but this here is the right advice. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 So, I say, you basically offer advice? "I listen, yeah, a shoulder to cry on. 
You put them on the right track. They come in, they don't know if they should 
do this or do that, what is the right move, what is the right thing. And you 
tell them, 'I think this is really right for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That just sounds like being a good guy, I suggest. Does that qualify as 
psychic aid? "Well," he says, referring to himself in the plural, "we're 
actually a good guy, and it's advice. . . . I myself am not very much into 
psychics, but the ones I've hired, they're really good. They really feel like 
they get deep into their auras. That's something to do with vibrations of the 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomborino says he asks customers if they're satisfied with the information his 
psychics provide at the going rate of $1 a minute. So far, he says, no 
complaints. "They're really, like, stung, sort of. Not frightened. They're 
just, like, "How can you know so much about me? You don't know me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tomborino proudly answers by saying: "Well, you got to expect it when you come 
in through that door. Some people are gifted with this power." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask how he got into the business. "Did you ever go up to L.A.? To Melrose?" 
he says. "I've seen some nice places up there, neons lighted up. I seen what's 
going on up there, wow, all those psychics, there must be something going on. 
Then seeing the television stuff, I said, what does it take to get into this 
business. I hired a couple psychics and got the office." 
</P>
<P>
 So, you're more the businessman than the psychic? "Businessman, right." 
</P>
<P>
 When I ask about the range of services, he says, "Tarot cards, the aura 
reading. I'm asking the customers, are they accurate, yes they are. It's more 
of a future thing, not the past. The palms, 99 to 100% accurate on the palms. 
You have your crystal ball, not many people ask for the crystal ball. They may 
have some readings, mind readings, vibrations readings, sand readings." 
</P>
<P>
 Sand readings? Tomborino explains that sand reading dates to the ancient 
Egyptians and involves placing the palms on fine sand. "It's pretty psychic," 
he says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not psychic himself, Tomborino believes in the power. "I've seen it 
done and I really believe in it. As a matter of fact, there's a guy where I go 
wash my van at the car wash over here, and he thought one of the younger girls 
was my girlfriend. I said, 'No, no, she just works for me.' 'She's good!' he 
says. 'I really followed up with her at my job.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the manager at the car wash. He was working seven bucks, eight bucks an 
hour, now he's the manager. So he's happy. He's real glad."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; PARAMEDICS PRAISE CRISIS PROCEDURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 By the time paramedics arrived, the 65-year-old man lay lifeless on the floor 
of his Northridge home. He had been eating a bowl of cereal Friday morning when 
a 4.6 aftershock rattled his house and left him suffering from a severe heart 
attack. Breathless, with no pulse, the man seemed destined to become yet 
another quake-related fatality. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was blue in the face -- basically he was not with us," said the first 
emergency service worker on the scene, paramedic Ron Lingo of the Los Angeles 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Working under an emergency order implemented after the earthquake, paramedics 
were able to treat the man differently from the way they typically treat heart 
attack victims: They were not required to call a hospital for instructions.  
</P>
<P>
 Lingo and his partner Mike Walker performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 
inserted an IV, defibrillated the man's heart and then, relying on their 
training and years of experience instead of on hospital nurses, they 
administered medication. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got pulses back with him, and we got a good blood pressure," Lingo said. 
"We saved his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours after the Northridge quake struck last week, paramedics with the 
city Fire Department began operating under what they call Communication Failure 
Protocols. The protocols, used primarily during a disaster, allow paramedics to 
treat certain types of patients without first calling a hospital for 
instructions -- an adjustment that emergency officials say saves time without 
diminishing the level of care rendered to victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advantages are much quicker patient care," said Alan R. Cowen, chief 
paramedic and commander of the city Fire Department's Bureau of Emergency 
Medical Services. "It doesn't make sense that when you have a cardiac arrest 
the first thing you need to do is run over and pick up a telephone. You should 
be treating the patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the protocols were rescinded earlier this week as the demands on the 
emergency system declined, county Emergency Medical Services officials say it 
might not be long before the procedures become standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the quake, county EMS officials already were studying the idea of 
eliminating the mandatory call to base hospitals for some patients. For nearly 
a year the Long Beach and Burbank fire departments had been conducting a pilot 
program giving paramedics more autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw that there was no change in the patient care," said Dr. Samuel 
Stratton, medical director of the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of that study, which will be reviewed by the Emergency Medical 
Services Commission at its next meeting, possibly in February, along with the 
experiences of paramedics during the quake, demonstrate that contact with 
hospitals is not needed in most instances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake was a devastating, terrible thing, but there's a number of 
things we're learning from it and this is one of those things: That we can 
function well under this type of system," Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, requests for Fire Department service -- including many for 
paramedics -- increased from an average 1,000 calls a day to 2,200 the first 
day, and 1,600 the next. While the demand on paramedics grew, their ability to 
contact hospitals declined. Several hospitals in the Valley were damaged and 
two of the three base stations were unable to accept calls from paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paramedics weren't calling base stations because there were no base 
stations," Cowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, paramedics are required to call a base hospital whenever they 
encounter patients experiencing chest pain, acute shortness of breath, symptoms 
related to hypertension and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 In such instances, the paramedic team will note the patient's medical history, 
take vital signs and assess the patient. While one paramedic remains with the 
patient, the other relays the information by phone or radio to the base 
hospital. Typically, a registered nurse then orders a treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the Northridge man, paramedics would -- under normal 
circumstances -- have called a hospital first before administering medication 
and then relayed the victim's response to the nurse after each dose of 
medication, Lingo said.  
</P>
<P>
 But after undergoing intensive training and years of experience and continual 
updates, paramedics say that call is unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know exactly what they're going to say," said Walker, a 12-year department 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes it is more than a tedious formality, paramedics say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hindrance to patient care," said paramedic Charles Barnett, who has 
been with the department 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, bad connections or street noise can make it difficult to hear nurses 
over the radio, paramedics say. And in instances where paramedics are inside a 
victim's house, away from their radios, the task is even more difficult. The 
phone might be in a different room from the patient, or sometimes relatives in 
the house might be reluctant to release the line to paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can spend 20 minutes in the field talking back and forth to the base 
station," paramedic Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days since the quake, paramedics such as Lingo and Walker have answered 
calls ranging from the mundane to the extraordinary. They have patched cuts and 
bruises suffered in falls during the quake, resuscitated heart attack victims, 
and assisted Salvador Pena, a janitor who was trapped for more than seven hours 
in the rubble of the Northridge Fashion Center's parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're dealing with a life-or-death situation, your No. 1 enemy is 
time," said Lingo, a 20-year department veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 And during times of disaster, when the flow of calls is seemingly endless, 
less time spent with one patient can mean the difference between life and death 
for another. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can treat, transport and clear, then you're available for the next 
call during a disaster like this earthquake," Capt. Steve Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer tied to the phone, doctors and nurses in base hospitals also are 
able to spend more time with patients in the emergency room, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Cott, director of education for the Long Beach Fire Department, said the 
paramedics in his department have adapted well to the procedural change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of pre-hospital medicine is pretty standard, and these are experienced 
medics who have been doing this for a long time," Cott said. "It's been 
morale-boosting for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, base hospitals would not be completely eliminated under the proposal. 
In some cases paramedics still would call hospitals for instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always going to be that 10% that are complicated or not clear, where 
one needs to get a second opinion," Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the change is approved, Los Angeles County, the largest emergency medical 
service agency in the world, will join numerous other municipalities that 
already have moved away from base hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, it is uncertain when the change actually would be implemented 
because it would cost money, and the quake has and will continue to drain 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake showed us that it will work, but it may have slowed us down 
because of problems with resources," Stratton said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; ROAD-WEARY COMMUTERS ARE LEARNING TO WING IT; 
TRANSIT: AVIATION FIRMS OFFER SERVICE FOR ANTELOPE AND SANTA CLARITA VALLEYS IN 
WAKE OF FREEWAY DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With the freeways slowed to a nightmarish crawl and the trains leaving well 
before dawn, it was only a matter of time until some people looked to the skies 
for relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing an earthquake-borne business opportunity when they see one, a 
number of small aviation companies have rushed to offer service connecting the 
Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys with the San Fernando Valley and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest entry in the field is Heli USA, a Santa Monica-based helicopter 
company that began shuttling people between an impromptu helipad at Saugus 
Speedway and Van Nuys and Santa Monica airports on Thursday. It has the 
capacity to serve 400 passengers a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was delightful," said first-time chopper commuter John Peterson of the 
10-minute ride that is accompanied by classical music. "It's smooth as silk, 
you're pampered -- very relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed aside, it's definitely a cool commute," added Peterson, who lives in 
Beverly Hills and is an advertising agency executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Northridge earthquake, a pair of Van Nuys companies -- Key 
West Air and Atlantis Aviation Services -- teamed up to offer on-demand service 
-- virtually an airborne taxi cab -- between William J. Fox Airfield in 
Lancaster and Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 A flight school based at Van Nuys Airport also joined the rush, hoping to 
match connecting private pilots with desperate commuters looking for someone to 
ferry them to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Masseur Wayne Quan, a Valencia resident, took a helicopter from Saugus to Van 
Nuys on Thursday because, he said, it was the only realistic way to reach his 
Westside clients, who footed the bill for his $98 round-trip flight.  
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to get in . . . but the traffic was horrible," he said. "My clients 
were willing to spring for the helicopter because they didn't want me stressed 
working on their stress." He expects to make the client-sponsored trip twice a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding traffic at any cost is what it's all about, say airborne travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopter passenger Peterson had driven from his Beverly Hills office to 
Santa Clarita on Wednesday. Once was enough.

<P>
 His dilemma: he had to get materials to a client by 10 a.m. Thursday, and he 
figured his cellular phone bill alone from sitting four hours on the freeways 
would have exceeded what he paid for the round-trip helicopter ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Flights in Atlantis Aviation's four-seat Cessna 172s take just 25 minutes from 
Lancaster to Van Nuys, hours less than the traffic-jammed road commutes that 
have become part of life on the south end of the Santa Clarita Valley since the 
quake knocked down portions of the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-way ticket on Heli USA is $59; round-trip tickets are discounted to $49 
each way. The trip to Santa Monica is $79 each way from Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuting in fixed-wing aircraft isn't much cheaper. Key West/Atlantis 
Aviation is charging $33 each way between Lancaster and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "That probably doesn't appeal to the low-end consumer," said Lance Alsheimer, 
chief pilot at Atlantis. "There are lawyers and actors who do (fly). Their time 
is worth a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Kurasch is neither a lawyer nor actor, but she said flying between Van 
Nuys and Lancaster is "cheaper than a cab." 
</P>
<P>
 As owner of a Santa Monica video production company making a music video in 
Lancaster, she needed to get there to check on things. Flying was the only 
reasonable way to get around, she said. Since the earthquake crippled the 
Southland freeway system, Kurasch said her primary mode of transportation has 
been plane or helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 For Philippe Lesourd and his business partner visiting from France there's 
been no alternative but to fly. Lesourd, who lives in Valencia and co-owns an 
auto auction company, found it was faster to drive to Lancaster and hop on a 
plane to Van Nuys than to fight the gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cost is not a concern," Lesourd said. "Thirty-three dollars is nothing. . . . 
We can't spend six hours on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Airport-based Argosy Airways had hoped to run commuter service from 
the Antelope Valley but was unable to meet federal requirements. To offer 
scheduled air service, approvals are required from the federal Department of 
Transportation as well as the Federal Aviation Administration -- a process that 
can take up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 For unscheduled flights -- flights on demand or air taxis -- the lengthy 
federal review is not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Argosy Airways is an approved air taxi service, it can offer on-demand 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody wants to charter me," said Argosy President Gail Black, "I could 
do it tomorrow." But, she said, to be both affordable to customers and 
profitable for business, she needs to offer scheduled service. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreational pilots are not allowed to haul passengers for hire. The only way 
a private pilot can transport people and take money for it is to equally share 
the costs with the passengers.  
</P>
<P>
 While many pilots have been flying people since the quake, O'Donnell said 
that, as of Wednesday, no complaints had been filed against pilots or companies 
operating outside the boundaries of their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Julianne Feuerhelm's West Winds Aviation is trying to coordinate a fly-share 
program that would match up pilots with "wanna-be" plane commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 800 pilots in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys," she said. 
"There are 250 private aircraft owned by people in that area. We're trying to 
get the aircraft owners and people who would be interested in flying . . . 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Private pilots and their passengers would share the operational costs of the 
flight, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fly-share service can be arranged, Feuerhelm said passengers would pay 
between $15 and $70 depending on the number of people on board and the flight 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Heli USA, for an additional $10, will shuttle passengers from the airport to 
their nearby final destinations. Other air passengers must fend for themselves 
once they touch ground -- which could mean costly cab or limo rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters may agree driving is a hassle and helicopters and planes are 
stress-free, but it's unknown whether they'll flock to air travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Business at SkyWest Airlines out of Palmdale Regional Airport was booming the 
first few days after the quake, said Ron Reber, senior vice president of 
marketing. But it has dropped off sharply.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AREA COURTS STRUGGLING TO RESUME OPERATIONS; 
JUSTICE: OFFICIALS DEAL WITH THEIR OWN VERSION OF GRIDLOCK IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
REBUILD THE VALLEY'S QUAKE-SCARRED LEGAL SYSTEM. 
</P>

<P>
 Donning hard hats, judges were allowed back into their condemned San Fernando 
courthouse Thursday to retrieve case files, grab computers and begin the 
daunting task of reconstructing a quake-battered legal system.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking only essential materials: case processing documents, computer 
equipment and essential court documents," said Thomas J. Zecchini, a court 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the courtrooms will be moved by Wednesday to the Van Nuys courthouse, 
itself damaged in the quake. Two floors there remained closed Thursday, with 
the other five open. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake has created two weeks of havoc in the Valley court 
system. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * Due to security concerns, all Superior Court criminal matters from both San 
Fernando and Van Nuys will be heard in the main Van Nuys Superior Court 
building, meaning all civil judges are being displaced to less stylish 
trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prosecutors in the district attorney's office who are used to having their 
own offices are suddenly faced with sharing office space with two roommates as 
San Fernando prosecutors move into the cramped Van Nuys quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jurors in the trial of Lyle Menendez, on trial for the murder of his wealthy 
parents, were forced earlier this week to deliberate in a trailer behind the 
Van Nuys courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prisoners being held in a cell on the fifth floor of the Van Nuys Municipal 
Court were trapped briefly when an aftershock Thursday jammed a door shut. 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials had no real timetable for the resumption of normal operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to say when we're going to be up and running because the 
clerk's office has to find all of those files," said Terry D. Wilson, the 
district chief at San Fernando Superior Court, who is overseeing the transfer 
of about 30,000 files to a makeshift clerk's office in an abandoned Health 
Department building in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando courthouse is expected to be uninhabitable for most of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said a year, and if it's sooner, be grateful," said Judge Judith M. 
Ashmann, who supervises the San Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-inch water line ruptured during the initial shaking, causing water 
damage on at least two floors of the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers this week were forced to use wooden posts to shore up the building 
and reinforce a total of 20 damaged support columns on three floors. 
</P>
<P>
 The building was initially declared safe, so Ashmann and others began the 
arduous cleanup process. But an internal inspection three days after the 
magnitude 6.6 quake found the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem, according to Ashmann, "was getting anyone to focus 
attention on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Displaced from her own office, Ashmann has struggled to develop an emergency 
plan to find courtrooms for her judges and then to handle an extensive backlog 
of cases, including two ongoing death penalty murder trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major crisis,' Ashmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-floor Van Nuys Superior Court building is structurally sound, but 
the temblor caused asbestos contamination throughout the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is asbestos coating on the beams, and when the earthquake came some of 
that shook down," said Jan Pollard, spokeswoman for the county Internal 
Services Division, which maintains county facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court buildings in San Fernando and Van Nuys received little damage 
and have been in operation since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two San Fernando Superior Court judges who hear family law matters have been 
moved next door to the relatively unscathed Municipal Court building, where 
they have continued to hear cases. 
</P>
<P>
 At least nine of the San Fernando judges are being reassigned to Van Nuys, 
causing officials to reopen six courtrooms located in nearby trailers that were 
mothballed more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we're going to have room for everybody," said Zoe Venhuizen, 
court manager in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court administrators are hoping to borrow at least one courtroom in 
the Municipal Court building, this in addition to the four courtrooms that have 
already been devoted to San Fernando Municipal Court cases. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been minor squabbles among judges who were less than happy to move 
to the cramped temporary courtrooms that were intentionally downsized so as not 
to intimidate children who appeared in the former dependency court facility, 
according to court employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Clerks who have worked and maintained files in their own courtrooms -- for 
years in some cases -- are also said to be angry about moving into temporary 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the chaos earlier this week, two Van Nuys Superior Court judges 
overseeing criminal calendars managed to tackle a few cases Monday morning in 
temporary courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday all criminal judges had a courtroom and one jury resumed to hear 
evidence in a lengthy trial for an accused serial rapist. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorneys in the San Fernando Branch of the Public Defender's 
office have also been forced to join their colleagues on the 10th floor of the 
Van Nuys Municipal Court building, but officials said they have plenty of room 
for the 16 people expected to move in.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA / NEWPORT BEACH; SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2 
ADMINISTRATOR QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The second-highest-ranking administrator at the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District resigned this week to accept a job in Sacramento, school officials 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol A. Berg, who has been deputy superintendent for the last four years, has 
accepted a job with School Services of California, a private consulting 
firm.Berg will begin there on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although Newport-Mesa will always be near and dear to my heart," Berg said, 
"this offer is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Berg began her career in the Newport-Mesa district in 1969 as a science 
teacher at the former Davis Middle School. She later served as principal at the 
now-closed Corona del Mar Elementary School, then became director of 
certificated personnel and assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 She was made deputy superintendent in 1989, and held the job when the district 
was rocked in 1992 by a $4-million embezzlement scandal. Former district budget 
director Stephen A. Wagner has been sentenced to six years in prison on charges 
growing out of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the resignation of Supt. John W. Nicoll after the Wagner incident, 
Berg became acting superintendent and ran the district on a day-to-day basis 
until Mac Bernd was hired in the summer as superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 In her new job, Berg will be a consultant to the 1,100 school districts in the 
state. Her main function will be to explain to the districts how to interpret 
and implement legislation signed by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg was instrumental in the creation of two language assessment centers, 
which assist families that do not speak English but need to get children 
registered for classes. Her influence extended to staff development, parent 
education and additional instruction for some students during summer or 
Christmas vacations.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; STADIUM WON'T BEAR COACH'S NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The football stadium near Mission Viejo High School will not be named in 
memory of Mike Rush, the school's former football coach, trustees of the 
Saddleback Valley Unified School District decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite pleas from a group of students and parents who said naming the stadium 
would be the only fitting tribute to the popular coach who died in November, 
trustees said Tuesday they consider a memorial on the Mission Viejo High campus 
more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I very strongly and wholeheartedly support a very special memorial on the 
Mission campus," said Trustee Marcia L. Birch. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees directed that the school appoint a committee of Mission Viejo high 
students, parents, faculty and alumni and Rush's widow, Pam Rush, to consider a 
tribute on the school's campus. Among the ideas they suggested were naming the 
library, weight room, practice field or a scholarship in Rush's honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees said they also want a report from the committee within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see this done as quickly as possible," said Trustee Bobbee 
Cline. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Rush and Sandie Gonzales, who led the drive for putting the coach's name 
on the now unnamed stadium, said they would be willing to sit on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see a positive, fitting . . . memorialization for Mike Rush," 
Gonzales said. Board members said naming the stadium for Rush would not be 
welcomed by other high schools in the district, especially Laguna Hills High, 
which shares use of the stadium for football games and other events. Several 
persons representing those schools emphasized that point to the board Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Monika Bickert, a non-voting student member of the board from El Toro 
High School: 
</P>
<P>
 "The naming of the stadium for Mike Rush could cause feelings of resentment 
for students at Laguna Hills. . . . He was a coach at Mission Viejo High 
School, his contributions were at that high school, and his memorial should be 
kept at that high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Rush died of a heart attack at age 46, eight months after he resigned his 
coaching position amid controversy over the school's devil mascot and reports 
of conflict between him and Principal Robert Metz. He continued to teach at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 In five seasons as head coach his teams compiled a 45-16 record. He had also 
been an assistant coach for 10 years.RICHARD CORE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; QUAKE DAMAGES CULTURAL CORE, 40 RESIDENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the San Fernando Valley's western outpost of earthquake damage, Calabasas 
was hit hard only at its two-block cultural core, including the historic Leonis 
Adobe, and about 40 homes throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, building officials had inspected nearly 2,000 structures in the 
semirural town of about 25,000 people. Forty residences were declared unfit to 
live in, and another 400 sustained enough damage to render parts of them 
unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaced residents may have taken refuge with friends and family or in 
hotels, City Manager Charles Cate speculated, because no tent communities have 
been erected in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday opened a relief application 
center at Calabasas High School, 22855 W. Mulholland Highway, for affected 
residents of Calabasas, Woodland Hills and nearby areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were an awful lot of dwellings with cracked chimneys, sidewalks and 
streets with fissures, and roadblocks pulled away," Cate said. "But we didn't 
have any commercial buildings that suffered more than superficial damage. I 
guess we can consider ourselves lucky in the overall scheme of things." 
</P>
<P>
 That was small comfort to those who suffered losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Phillips, who has spent several decades restoring the Leonis Adobe on the 
city's border with Los Angeles, spoke haltingly about cracks expected to keep 
the landmark closed for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't much left that's right," Phillips said of the building, built in 
1845. "It's very bad. It got a bad shaking. The contents survived almost 
intact, but the structure itself is very damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's Plummer House and animal pens are still open for public viewing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the city's historic core, known as Old Calabasas, was shut down 
last week because of a gas leak that forced the closure of Calabasas Road 
between Park Granada Boulevard and Mulholland Drive until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Florence Ross, who lives on Park Esperanza, is one of dozens of Calabasas 
residents who will spend the rest of this winter without a fireplace because 
her chimney collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The terrible thing is that it was all set to light a fire in the morning," 
said Ross, 68. "I had paper wadded up under the grill and logs ready to go. But 
then the atom bomb went off, the chimney fell down and everything in my house 
that could move was put asunder." 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the Las Virgenes Unified School District, unlike their 
counterparts in Los Angeles, missed no school because of the earthquake. Nor 
was there structural damage to any Las Virgenes school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very fortunate," Supt. Albert (Bud) Marley said. "We had some books 
fall down and some cracked paint. The overall cost to get everything healed 
should be about $75,000. It's a different world from L. A." KURT PITZER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; CONDITION OF HOSPITAL IS NEAR NORMAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Every room in Holy Cross Medical Center is a recovery room. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical professionals who found themselves near the hub of last week's 
earthquake now are finding time to embrace, cringe together during aftershocks, 
and talk. "How are you?" no longer is a conversation-filler. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've found is people need to talk about it," said Jane Cessar, 
spokeswoman for the Mission Hills hospital. "They don't need tips and guides as 
much as people to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 Just four days after opening its doors again, Holy Cross already is 
surprisingly close to the tidiness and order typical of a medical center. Major 
portions are functioning, including obstetrics, critical care and non-trauma 
emergency care. This Tuesday, two babies were born in the newly repaired 
maternity ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how they just do that," joked Ann Moore, manager of 
maternal-child health at the center. Because the nursery was damaged, babies 
and mothers now recover together -- an increasingly common approach at 
maternity wards, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kind of planning to do this anyway," she said. "It just got started 
sooner. We actually were forced into doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake forced many changes throughout Mission Hills, most of 
them far less positive. The community's ranch-style homes on large lots show 
damage. A massive warehouse on Stranwood Avenue lost part of its wall, 
revealing a jumble of toppled pallets stacked with dry goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley's most famous adobe historic sites shared differing fates. The San 
Fernando Mission suffered little more than cracked plaster. After the Feb. 9, 
1971, Sylmar quake, the historic site was retrofitted to withstand earthquakes 
better, said Msgr. Francis J. Weber, the mission's director. "That's probably 
what saved us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curators at the nearby Andres Pico adobe can't say the same. An 
earthquake-stabilization project was still in the planning stages when the 
quake tore a hole in a wall, sheared off a chimney and toppled a courtyard 
wall. The building will remain closed for at least another year, according to 
curators of the house. GEOFFREY MOHAN LOS ANGELES

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; MAN WHO WAS HIT BY PICKUP TRUCK DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 28-year-old man who was hit by a pickup truck as he tried to cross Beach 
Boulevard died of his injuries early Thursday, the Orange County coroner's 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Saldana of Stanton was running across Beach near Pacific Street about 
7:30 p.m. Tuesday when he was hit by the northbound truck. He was not in a 
crosswalk, Sheriff's Lt. Jay Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had made it to the center divider but as soon as he stepped onto the other 
side, he was hit," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saldana died at 3:10 a.m. Thursday at UCI Medical Center in Orange. The driver 
of the pickup was not cited, Mendez said.

<P>
 After narrowly escaping the brunt of last fall's wildfires, residents of 
Topanga Canyon weathered the Northridge earthquake with severe damage only to 
about 20 homes and widespread inconveniences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anyone who didn't have something break," said Marty Brastow, a 
local realtor and member of the Topanga Canyon Town Council. "But, overall, I'd 
say we've been pretty lucky recently." 
</P>
<P>
 Several hillside homes on Topanga Skyline Drive and Portage Circle Drive have 
been deemed uninhabitable, said Eric Nelson, who lives on Portage Circle. 
Nelson's 1986 Isuzu Trooper also was damaged when a propane tank dislodged from 
a home on the hill above his garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those 300 or 500 gallon types," Nelson said. "It broke loose, 
rolled down a hill, broke a retaining wall and smashed into my car. It's 
probably a good thing that it did, or it would have rolled into my house or my 
neighbor's house." 
</P>
<P>
 At Top O' Topanga mobile home park, the loss of running water and natural gas 
strained some residents' nerves, said Bea Feldman, who lives in one of the 224 
dwellings. The Gas Co. estimated that the park would be without gas until late 
next week. 
</P>

 "A lot of people are definitely testy from having to use the temporary toilets 
in the cold," said Feldman, 57.  
</P>
<P>
 Others, she said, are pitching in to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an emergency committee that has been making rounds with 
walkie-talkies, making sure people are all right and have their medications," 
Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the canyon was without water for about two days and without 
electricity for more than a day after the Jan. 17 quake, said Dale Robinette, 
board member of the Topanga Canyon Town Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Several large boulders fell onto Topanga Boulevard, which cracked in several 
places but was open to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our damage was very patchwork," Robinette said. "As with the capriciousness 
of the firestorm, disaster struck with no rhyme or reason we mortals would 
understand." KURT PITZER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; QUAKE VICTIM BURIED; CITY REGAINS CALM

 The campers have left the park and the damage to property seems to be minimal 
in Sun Valley, but last week's earthquake left one resident dead and nerves 
throughout the community badly shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-year-old Lionel Ventura was buried Thursday after a bilingual service 
at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park, Glendale, with about 50 family members and 
friends in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura was on a respirator at Holy Cross Medical Center when the earthquake 
knocked out power to his life support. He had been hospitalized since a Dec. 17 
traffic accident left him in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Valley man, who dreamed of making it big as a musician or a disc 
jockey, seemed to have been improving, moving his arms and starting to focus 
his eyes on visitors, before the earthquake hit, said friend Michael Owens.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon, who grew up in Sun 
Valley and whose mother still lives there, set up phone banks to call residents 
and assess damage in the East Valley district he represents. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is that Sun Valley suffered less damage than most," said Alarcon, 
who added that volunteers had called 3,000 residents by Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who were called said they did not want their homes to be inspected, 
Alarcon said, but others welcomed the call. Those who declined inspections 
might have feared that their homes would be condemned, the councilman 
speculated.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that I didn't expect was that senior citizens said they 
appreciated the call, because no one had checked on them yet," Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Valley Park, which had been crowded with overnight campers in the days 
immediately following the earthquake, has been empty for about a week, said 
Ricardo Davis, the park's recreation director. Last weekend, Davis said, he 
made the park available for use as a Red Cross Shelter, but it was not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's calm," said Randy Kelly, director of Stonehurst Park, another Sun Valley 
park, which has been used as a Federal Emergency Management Agency Disaster 
Application Center. "There are people waiting today, but there is no line." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the lack of activity, he said, is that the center no longer 
gives out food vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The FEMA center at Stonehurst has been open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., although 
the doors close at about 8 p.m., Kelly said. ED BOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; RACIST FLYERS UPSET STUDENTS AT 2 
SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Marco F. Forster Middle School was flooded this week with flyers containing 
racist remarks, on the same day identical flyers were found at Laguna Beach 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies and representatives from the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission were called to both campuses after students found the flyers in 
their lockers when they arrived Tuesday morning, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 All 1,200 of the lockers at Marco Forster contained flyers, said Jacqueline 
Price, a spokeswoman for the Capistrano Unified School District. About 300 
flyers were found on the Laguna Beach High School campus, said Principal 
Barbara Callard. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from both campuses said the flyers shocked and "deeply offended" the 
students who saw them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were pretty upset," Price said of the 1,125 seventh- and 
eighth-grade students at Marco Forster. "During the second period, the 
principal apologized to the students on the public-address system for what 
happened. He reiterated that the school does not tolerate this activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers were discovered by students who attend what the district calls Zero 
Period, a class period that starts at 7:20 a.m., before the actual school day 
begins, Price said. The flyers were recovered and turned over to police before 
most of the students arrived, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Laguna Beach, a meeting was held Wednesday night that gave Callard "a 
chance to have some contact with parents right away." But she intends to send a 
letter to all parents explaining the flyer situation, Callard said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Extra police patrols will watch the campus for a few days, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers contained a telephone number of a taped message from a San Diego 
County-based group called WAR -- the White Aryan Resistance. LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY JOINS ALTERNATIVE EL TORO REUSE PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has voted 6-0 to join the Orange County Regional Airport 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization is made up of several North County cities trying to influence 
the future of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, scheduled to close by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was organized by Garden Grove, Los Alamitos and Stanton last summer 
to monitor the base conversion planning and support development of a commercial 
airport on the 4,700-acre base. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach is the first city to join the group since its inception.  
</P>
<P>
 The airport authority "will be an advocate of conversion (of El Toro Marine 
Base) to a commercial airport," Newport Beach City Manager Kevin Murphy said at 
a council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The council chose Mayor Clarence J. Turner as representative to the 
organization and Councilman John Hedges, an airline pilot, as alternate. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional airport authority is trying to decide whether it will just 
monitor the work of the county's El Toro agency or submit a rival redevelopment 
plan to the Defense Department, which will make the final decision on civilian 
use of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim is also considering joining the regional airport authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's nine-member El Toro Reuse Planning Authority consists of the five 
county supervisors, three Irvine City Council members and one from Lake Forest. 
Although Newport Beach and Anaheim had once been proposed for membership on the 
planning board, they were left off under the plan finally approved by the Board 
of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 North County cities and others not part of the top board of directors have 
been invited to join a 50-member executive council of the reuse planning 
authority. That panel will also draw members from the county, representatives 
from seven unincorporated areas of the South County, seven business groups and 
four universities. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; MORE INPUT SOUGHT ON CHURCH ADDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has asked city planners to talk with neighbors of 
Christ Lutheran Church before the commission considers a request to add 7,780 
square feet of new classrooms and a day-care center to the church school on 
Victoria Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the church told the commission Monday that parents who drop their 
children off at the school are creating too much noise when they drive on 
nearby residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Elmore, who lives near the school, brought a petition signed by 17 
neighbors who oppose the planned expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Thomas E. Steinfeld, a member of the church, told the commission he 
is willing to work with residents. He told Elmore after the meeting that he 
would like to include the petition in a newsletter to parents, to alert people 
to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steinfeld also said he had never before heard any complaints about noise 
generated by people traveling to the church or school. 
</P>
<P>
 Elmore said he would like parents to drop their children off at the school's 
front entrance on Victoria Street instead of the rear entrance on Congress 
Street. Traffic going to the Congress Street entrance passes his home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school wants to build five new classrooms, two new restrooms and two 
day-care rooms in a second-floor expansion. The commission is set to hear the 
request on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the commission decided to rehear on Feb. 14 a request to open 
an alcohol-free pool hall in the Mesa Verde Drive Plaza at 1525 Mesa Verde 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Issa Abdel Ahad presented plans for a 10-table pool hall to be open from 10 
a.m. to 1 a.m. every day. He had proposed at a December commission meeting to 
serve alcohol, but commissioners said that might result in noise, loitering, 
vandalism and other crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighboring business owners came to the commission meeting to say they 
oppose a pool hall even without alcohol served. Bookseller Robert A. Michna 
said six store owners signed a petition opposing the pool hall. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; NATIVE AMERICANS PROTEST TIMES POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 15 protesters picketed the offices of the Times Orange County Edition in 
Costa Mesa on Thursday, complaining about the Los Angeles Times' coverage of 
Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 August Spivey, spokesman for Newport Beach-based American Indian Resistance, 
said his group is unhappy with what he described as The Times' failure to 
identify Native Americans as a separate and distinct minority, particularly in 
stories containing statistics about various ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Times officials denied the newspaper's coverage has been lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Spivey's group has called for a boycott of The Times until the newspaper 
improves its coverage of Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the most impoverished minority in America," said Spivey, a Cherokee. 
"Statistics cause change. To list us as a race gives us back our history and 
gives us a future." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Morgan, a spokeswoman for The Times in Los Angeles, defended the paper's 
coverage of Native Americans, adding that no one in the publisher's office was 
aware of any calls for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Times regularly reports on Native American affairs, covering a range of 
issues fairly and completely," she said. "We are happy to have a dialogue with 
this group as we have with many others because we are always interested in ways 
to improve our coverage." DAVID HALDANE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA, YORBA LINDA; 6TH-GRADER TRANSFERS DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School district officials are trying to reassure parents who are protesting a 
proposal to move sixth-grade students from elementary schools to middle 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In letters to Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District officials and at 
school board meetings, parents have vehemently opposed the idea of their 
11-year-old children attending school with 13-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 We "encourage children to mature socially more quickly than their limited life 
experiences have adequately prepared them," wrote parent Christine Markstrum in 
a letter to the school board. "Placing sixth-graders with eighth-graders is 
another instance of this accelerated move for social maturity." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the concern from parents deals with the social pressures sixth-grade 
students can face at middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 One parent, M.A. Sumantha, said in an interview that his daughter, who attends 
Morse Avenue Elementary School, would not be ready for the peer pressure she 
would encounter at a middle school next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she would be exposed to situations she wouldn't be ready to handle," 
Sumantha said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one district trustee has also questioned the wisdom of putting 
sixth-graders on the same campus as eighth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to fight problems such as drug abuse and teen-age pregnancies 
on the one hand, yet we are making a decision on an issue that may contribute 
to them," Trustee Craig Olson said at a board meeting earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the district's sixth-graders are enrolled in Placentia-Yorba 
Linda's 18 elementary schools, officials are hoping to change that and 
eventually move them to the five middle schools. However, no target date has 
been set yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sixth-, seventh-, eighth-grade configuration is very good for students," 
said Sharon McHolland, assistant superintendent for education. "It provides 
more academic opportunities and allows them to participate in programs not 
available at elementary school." 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda Middle School Principal Ken Lorge said in an interview that most 
parents who come to him with concerns about how well sixth-graders adapt to 
middle school are pleased when they tour the campus and observe the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see that for the most part the older students look out for the 
sixth-graders," Lorge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorge, who was principal at an elementary school with a sixth grade before 
coming to Yorba Linda, is convinced that sixth-graders belong at middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Socially, academically and emotionally, they fit in better here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of sixth-graders at Yorba Linda Middle School, one of the two district 
middle schools that have a sixth grade, agreed, saying they prefer the middle 
school to elementary school. The students liked trading classes every hour, 
being exposed to older students and engaging in the stepped-up social life that 
middle school offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get bored with teachers because you only have them for a little 
while," said sixth-grader Kristen Rollins. "The dances are fun, too. I have a 
friend in sixth grade at (an elementary school) and she tells me to quit 
bragging when I talk about the dances."  
</P>
<P>
 Another sixth-grader, Megan Garrigues, said that although the older students 
tease and harass the younger students at the beginning of the year, it doesn't 
last long. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as you make a few (older) friends, they leave you alone," she said. 
"It's not a big deal." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 32 SCHOOLS HOST 60 AUTHORS IN FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 60 authors of children's books paid visits to 32 schools in 
Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley and Westminster on Thursday, sharing their 
background in literature and the writing craft with 20,000 pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 The Authors' Festival is sponsored annually by the Friends of the Children's 
Library in Huntington Beach and its goal is to offer children a firsthand look 
at writing and publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the participating authors, Ed Radlauer, 72, of La Mirada Heights, has 
taken part in the program for several years, and was joined by his wife, Ruth, 
also an author. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Radlauer said children most often ask him how long he has been an author: 
30 years; how many books he has written: 200, and much money he makes: "enough 
to live on." 
</P>
<P>
 "The (local) children are prepared, almost without fail. It's a great pleasure 
to serve children when they are ready to learn," he said, adding that the 
authors' visits help the children to become enthusiastic readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attempt to be writers too, he said. His advice: "Select a subject you 
like, research it and tell about it."  
</P>
<P>
 Radlauer writes mostly for junior high school children, and about 90% of his 
work is nonfiction. His biggest-selling book is titled "Earthquakes," and has 
sold about 100,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending the festival at William E. Kettler Elementary School in 
Huntington Beach was Laurel Visser, a fifth-grader. By coincidence Laurel is 
reading "A Native American Doctor" by Jeri Ferris, who met with upper-grade 
pupils at the school Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel learned from Ferris that she most likes to write about people who are 
famous. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal John Magnuson said the festival is a wonderful event, teaching 
children how stories are generated and how authors connect their experiences to 
what they want to write about. The children also learn that they have the same 
kind of experiences that the authors do, Magnuson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Library Director Ron Hayden likened the gathering of authors "to missionaries, 
spreading the word of literature." ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; CITY MANAGER KENNY WILL RETIRE IN MARCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Manager Jerry Kenny announced this week that he will retire after more 
than 20 years with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny, 64, said he will leave on March 4. He has been city manager since 
January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny's retirement comes at a time when the city is facing serious political 
troubles that include a recall targeting Mayor Charles V. Smith and three other 
City Council members and an investigation by the district attorney's office 
into alleged overtime fraud at the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said a temporary city manager will be named by next month and a 
consultant will be hired to help in the search for a permanent replacement.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; FIREFIGHTERS' UNION LEADER FACES FIRING 
</P>

 Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. said he intends to fire Paul Gilbrook, the 
president of the Westminster Firefighters Assn. who has been under 
investigation for allegedly driving a fire engine with a suspended driver's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco on Thursday sent a notice to Gilbrook, who is also under 
investigation for allegedly using sick leave improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook has maintained that he has done nothing wrong and that the 
investigations against him are in retaliation for his support of a recall drive 
against four members of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook, who could not be reached Thursday, was given until Wednesday to 
answer DeMonaco's notice. If he does not respond by that date, the termination 
will take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook, an engineer, will remain on suspension with pay until "a final 
determination is made by the city." He has been suspended with pay since Dec. 
28. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook's license was suspended for 30 days, beginning Feb. 12, 1993, after a 
drunk-driving conviction. City officials provided few details as to when 
Gilbrook might have driven a Fire Department vehicle during the 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan C. Davis, Gilbrook's lawyer, said his client has not been notified of the 
intent to terminate him. 
</P>
<P>
 It's bizarre that someone should know about his firing by reading a newspaper, 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul Gilbrook is absolutely innocent of any wrongdoing. He is a highly 
regarded and decorated firefighter who has been praised by his own battalion 
chief and previous chiefs of the department," Davis said.BERT ELJERA

week that he will retire June 30.

 "If I chose, I could stick around a couple more years. But I have other things 
I want to do," Borst said. "I plan to do some consulting, look into some 
business ventures, do some writing, enjoy my grandchildren and tend to my rose 
garden."

MAN IS FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER IN SHOOTING OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A San Pedro man was convicted of first-degree murder Thursday in the 1991 
shooting of a man outside a local nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury deliberated for about five hours before convicting James 
Jordan McClain, 24, of murdering Willie Curtis Ford, 26, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred in the parking lot of Mr. J's in Santa Ana, after Ford 
came to the aid of a woman whom McClain was annoying with profane language. 
</P>
<P>
 After speaking briefly with Ford, McClain fired seven rounds from a 
9-millimeter pistol at him, striking him four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, a construction worker from Bellflower, died later at a nearby hospital, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn Kirkwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased with the verdict," said Paul D. Ford, the victim's 
brother. "I have a lot of faith in the justice system, and we've been kind of 
praying that this kind of verdict would come." 
</P>
<P>
 James P. Spellman, McClain's attorney, could not be reached for comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 McClain faces a possible sentence of 25 years to life in prison when he is 
sentenced Feb. 25, Kirkwood said.

TRABUCO CANYON MAN GETS 6 YEARS FOR MOLESTING GIRLS; COURTS: THE STABLE WORKER 
HAD BEFRIENDED HIS FOUR VICTIMS' FAMILIES. THEIR PARENTS TELL OF THE PAIN HE 
CAUSED. 
</P>

<P>
 A former stable handyman was sentenced Thursday to six years in prison for 
molesting four young girls whose families he had befriended. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, the girls' parents spoke of the pain that Ray Rowe, 48, of 
Trabuco Canyon, caused the children and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victims did not speak, but they all wanted him to go away as long as 
possible," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Nancy du Pont. 
</P>
<P>
 She said additional evidence was presented about a fifth victim whose alleged 
molestation took place too long ago for authorities to file charges. 
</P>
<P>
 South Orange County Municipal Court Judge Ronald P. Kreber sentenced Rowe to 
the term that prosecutors and defense attorneys had previously agreed upon in 
exchange for Rowe's guilty pleas. He pleaded guilty to two felony counts of 
lewd conduct with a child and two felony and two misdemeanor molestation 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors sought to nullify the agreement after police confirmed Rowe's 
statement that he had a prior assault conviction for stabbing his wife's lover 
in Texas in the early 1970s, but the judge declined to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the girls were 12 when the molestation took place, and the other was 
11, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Marri Derby, who represented Rowe, said her client is a 
"sick" man who cannot control his sexual urges. Derby said she could not 
quarrel with the sentence, but expressed concerns that a prison term will not 
help rehabilitate her client. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is extremely remorseful and he knows he has problems. He truly feels very 
bad for what he has done," Derby said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Rowe was a victim of child molestation and grew up to repeat the 
behavior. Derby said more needs to be done to help treat sexual offenders so 
they will not offend again. 
</P>
<P>
 The first molestation took place in Tustin in 1991 after Rowe persuaded the 
girl's parents to let him take her fishing. Rowe has a young daughter and told 
the parents he was seeking out a companion for his own child. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowe was arrested last year after molesting a second girl who was visiting a 
Trabuco Canyon area stable to ride horses. Two additional victims came forward 
after learning of his arrest.

POLICE READY TO GO OFF THE RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the shock and anger of employees at the Laguna Beach Police Department, 
some of their personal conversations at work were unknowingly tape-recorded 
over the past several months -- including idle comments and even cracks about 
their bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. said Thursday, resulted from "a 
glitch" in new communications equipment installed at headquarters which should 
be fixed today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that are directly affected by the taping are obviously very 
surprised and hurt by the whole situation," said police Detective Jason 
Kravetz, vice president of the Laguna Beach Police Employees' Assn. "People 
think that their conversations are going to be used against them and that's why 
some folks are very upset about the taping." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kravetz said police Chief Neil J. Purcell, Jr. assured association 
members during a 2 1/2-hour meeting on Jan. 14 that employees will not be 
reprimanded for whatever they have said while being unknowingly taped. The 
chief "offered his apologies and pretty much answered our concerns," Kravetz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing was done intentionally and, as I've indicated (in a memo to 
department employees) before, I'm sincerely sorry some people feel offended," 
Purcell said Thursday. "No one has been disciplined or would they be 
disciplined for something said in idle chatter, other than if there was a 
criminal plot taking place." 
</P>
<P>
 It all started when four new telephones were installed in the department, 
three in the records office near the front counter and one in the nearby 
dispatch center. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the telephones did not come with a cradle for the receiver, when 
employees press the release button to end a telephone conversation, the handset 
microphone continues recording office sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone conversations are normally recorded because department officials 
want to ensure that employees respond appropriately to the public and to 
document conversations that might eventually be useful in court, according to 
Lt. Paul Workman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to go back and discipline people for calling the chief names 
or calling the captain names. We really don't want to hear what these people 
have to say," he said. "We don't have time for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Workman said Sgt. Danell Adams had told him shortly before the massive Oct. 27 
fire in Laguna Beach to check out what appeared to be a problem with the 
telephones, but that he was sidetracked by the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "That fire was a major emotional event for everyone here so I pretty much 
forgot dealing with that phone situation," Workman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Workman released a memo to workers telling them to be 
circumspect about their personal conversations and to "please consider yourself 
recorded at all times." However, he did not say that office conversations were, 
in fact, being recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 After the telephones involved had been tested and identified, Workman said he 
wrote a second memo saying "as it turns out, you were being bugged." 
</P>
<P>
 Workman now admits he should have handled the situation differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mind did not think of invasion of privacy," he said. "In retrospect, I 
completely sympathize with them. . . . At the time, I'm thinking, 'We got a 
problem down in an open records area' and it just didn't strike me as something 
that was going to hurt a lot of peoples' feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in retrospect, Purcell said, "we probably should have said something to 
(the employees) before" but "a lot of serious things occurred and it went down 
on the priority list." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ann Christoph called the uproar "much ado about nothing as far as I can 
tell."

 "I think you have to also recognize we had a major emergency here and it was 
not the time to go around fixing equipment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some new equipment is next on the agenda for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders say the manufacturer has since told the city they have had 
similar problems with that type of equipment in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It now appears it is in fact a mechanical error," Councilman Wayne Peterson 
said. "The equipment was faulty." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said: "We are working with the company that 
makes the phones and (will) correct the problem. That's our intention, to 
correct the problem and be done with it."AUDIO RECORDINGS

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; BABY LIVING IN CAR AFTER QUAKE DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 13-month-old boy died of a severe fever after living in a car outside the 
family home because of fears of another major earthquake, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the death may have been caused by meningitis, not by his living 
conditions, authorities indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that living in the car caused this baby's death," said Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Detective Pam Schrick. Sheriff's deputies and a 
coroner's investigator, who asked not to be identified, said the first 
indications were the child died of meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Campa, whose temperature soared to 107 degrees before he died early 
Wednesday morning, was living with relatives outside the family home in the 
2400 block of Race Street in Newhall, said Lt. Bill Dunn, of the Santa Clarita 
Sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents in the predominantly Latino neighborhood where Campa lived have 
been camping outside and living in cars, fearful of another earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, relatives became alarmed because the child had a burning 
fever and the boy's grandfather tried to administer CPR to the child, 
authorities said. Paramedics took the child to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 7:29 a.m., according to a coroner's 
report.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; UNSAFE TO DRINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Water service has been restored to nearly all customers of the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power, but an advisory to boil tap water remains in 
portions of the northern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the shaded area, residents should boil water for at least five minutes 
before using or consuming.To disinfect water with bleach, add 8 drops of plain 
household bleach per gallon of water if it is clear and 16 drops if it is 
cloudy. Mix well and let sit for 30 minutes. Water disinfected with bleach will 
have a faint chlorine taste and odor. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley areas in which the DWP advisory is still in effect include: 
</P>
<P>
 * North of the Simi Valley Freeway (118), between Reseda Boulevard on the west 
and the Golden State (5) and San Diego (405) freeways on the east. 
</P>
<P>
 * North of Devonshire Street, south of Rinaldi Street, east of De Soto Avenue 
and west of Woodley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers with questions should call (818) DIAL DWP or (800) DIAL DWP outside 
the 818 area code. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the advisory is lifted, residents should flush their plumbing system by 
running water in the bathtub or shower for at least five minutes. In addition, 
each faucet on the property should be run for at least a minute. If your water 
heater contains water delivered during an advisory period, drain it if 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Clarita Valley, the following areas are advised to keep boiling 
their water:

COPTERS TO SWARM AT CONVENTION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you live near the Anaheim Convention Center, don't wake up Saturday 
thinking you're in the movie "Apocalypse Now," because the helicopters you'll 
be seeing and hearing have nothing to do with the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Helicopter Assn., which is made up of the owners and 
manufacturers of civilian copters, will hold its 48th annual convention Sunday 
through Tuesday at the center. About 60 helicopters will begin arriving today, 
but the bulk will fly in Saturday, spokesman Dan Warsley said.

RAIN CREATES MUDSLIDES, CLOSES ROAD; WEATHER: SUDDEN DOWNPOUR IN SOUTH COUNTY 
PRODUCES WALL OF MUD AND DEBRIS THAT FLOWS INTO LAGUNA CANYON ROAD BUSINESSES. 
A DRY WEEKEND IS EXPECTED.

 A surprise storm dumped nearly half an inch of rain over parts of Orange 
County, causing mudslides and road closures Thursday in fire-scarred Laguna 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Mud "went through every square inch of the shop," said Bob Chenault, manager 
of Stricker Automotive, which was among shops in the 2000 block of Laguna 
Canyon Road hardest hit by a six- to 18-inch wall of mud and debris. The road 
was closed, and no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Chenault spent the morning shoveling mud from inside the shop and from a 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at Stricker Automotive and other businesses in the complex had 
scrambled to try to prevent the mud and water from entering their shops. Some 
hastily erected a dam made of a tow truck, a flatbed truck, bricks, plywood, 
sandbags and anything else they could get their hands on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within 10 minutes we had mud everywhere," said Norman Wert, head mechanic at 
Canyon Auto Repair. "It just came down like a river. It was quick." 
</P>
<P>
 A storm cell from an unstable weather system along the Southern California 
coast unleashed the torrent that dropped nearly half an inch of rain within an 
hour in Laguna Beach and .87 of an inch in Santa Ana, according to Laguna Beach 
Battalion Fire Chief Joe McClure and other officials who tracked the storm by 
computer from a city command center. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend is expected to be fair and dry with some high cloudiness, said 
Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which forecasts weather for 
The Times. Southern California can expect a warming trend with temperatures in 
the mid-60s, and possibly in the low 70s by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 While only trace amounts of rain fell in Fullerton and Yorba Linda, the 
capricious rainstorm struck the southern portion of Orange County with moderate 
amounts of rainfall, including the Sand Canyon area of Irvine, which received 
.43 of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're faring pretty well," said Jack Stubbs, emergency planning officer for 
San Clemente, which suffered a massive landslide during a rainstorm a year ago. 
"We're dry and the slide area is intact." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Anaheim Battalion Chief Rudy Weyland reported that Anaheim Hills, 
which also had slides last year, came through the rain without problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Fire Capt. Api Weinert said the storm's quickness caught the city 
by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard there was supposed to be rain likely by about 6:30 a.m., and we 
manned the command center between 7 and 7:30 a.m.," Weinert said. "I was on the 
telephone with the National Weather Service, and they were telling me to expect 
only a 60% chance of rain when it was already raining here." 
</P>
<P>
 In about an hour, nearly half an inch of rain fell on the South County city, 
he said. City officials said that at least half an inch of rain must fall 
before they will order evacuations in areas devastated by the Oct. 27 fire that 
swept through parts of Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was among victims of last fall's firestorms, which burned off 
soil-stabilizing brush and grass from hills around and within the city. More 
than 16,680 acres of vegetation and 366 homes were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, a heavy downpour flooded streets and damaged homes, prompting 
Laguna Beach to establish a computer weather-tracking system inside a command 
center where workers are on call in case of the threat of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the silt dams, sandbagging and other diversion techniques implemented 
in preparation for rain kept water and mud away from homes and buildings, 
Weinert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unstable storm also created waterspouts in the Pacific Ocean that traveled 
up the San Diego County coast, Thoren said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The upper-level system that tracked directly right over you in Orange County 
was not enough to develop heavy rain, but very spotty rainfall," Thoren said. 
"That stuff is very hard to predict as to who's going to get it and who's not."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; ROAD BUILDING VIRTUALLY ISOLATES MOBILE HOME 
PARK; BYPASS: AS CREWS TRANSFORM A ONCE-NEGLECTED CANYON ROUTE, RESIDENTS CAN 
ENTER AND EXIT ONLY BY A CONSTRUCTION ZONE ROUTE SEVERAL MILES LONG. 
</P>

 Attention, motorists: When the new bypass to the Golden State Freeway opens in 
a few days and you begin racing down The Old Road, how about giving a nod of 
acknowledgment to the few remaining folks at the mobile home park there? 
They've been feeling a bit low. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nearly two weeks since the Northridge earthquake -- apart from still 
lacking running water and natural gas for heating and cooking due to quake 
damage -- residents of the Crescent Valley Mobile Home Park also have been 
virtually isolated by the road construction at their doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the 5 freeway is the whole city's priority. But we just feel we're 
getting rolled over by the people who want the freeway to go through. A little 
attention would be nice. An insurance adjuster would be fine," said park 
resident Chuck Brooke, 40, echoing others' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 As crews have toiled furiously to transform the once-neglected canyon road 
into a new freeway route, residents of the mobile home park have only been able 
to get in and out through a construction zone route several miles long -- and 
only by showing special passes and being escorted by California Highway Patrol 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, the 87-unit park, where many homes sustained extensive 
damage, has had no mail delivery, no newspaper delivery and no television until 
cable was restored Thursday. Residents said even relatives and repair 
contractors have had a hard time getting in. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son is with the Sheriff's Department. He's a sergeant. And they wouldn't 
let him through," said park manager Angie Leano, 69, who has lived there since 
the hillside park opened in 1969. Because of the access and utility problems, 
two-thirds of the park residents have left, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those was Joe Cerulle Jr., 36, a Los Angeles Department of 
Transportation surveyor who returned briefly with his father Thursday for the 
first time since Saturday. "We're not sure how long it's going to be before we 
get a reasonable semblance of life back here," Cerulle said. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have stayed, there also has been the endless staccato sounds of 
heavy equipment breaking up the concrete debris of the freeway bridge over 
Gavin Canyon, part of which fell in the quake. Then the park had to be 
evacuated Sunday so Caltrans could dynamite the still-standing remains. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, Caltrans officials say they hope to reopen the Golden State Freeway 
through Santa Clarita using the new bypass along The Old Road to skirt the 
damaged section of freeway. The park is about midway on the bypass, which will 
run from Calgrove Boulevard to the Weldon Canyon truck station. 
</P>
<P>
 For park residents, many of whom came to the isolated area to escape urban 
life, the opening of the bypass promises to be a mixed blessing. They no longer 
will be cut off, but they will have a four-lane freeway at their front door for 
what officials say will be at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 From his back yard, Brooke, an unemployed saxophonist, has a bird's-eye view 
of the now-gaping space where the freeway bridge used to stand. He marveled at 
how fast Caltrans has worked to open the bypass, saying, "Seven days ago it was 
a deteriorating canyon road. Now it's a freeway. Amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gosh, I don't think I'll look good as a hood ornament," said Leano, worrying 
like others that the soon-to-be-rushing-past traffic will make trying to drive 
out of the park a safety nightmare. Except for the brief evacuation, Leano said 
she has not left the park since the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the park manager, whose unit is one of many there posted as unsafe because 
of quake damage, said she and remaining residents still plan to persevere. 
"We'll have to bear it. We're going to have to do it. That's all there is to 
it," she said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE PUTS TRAFFIC CONGESTION INTO OVERDRIVE; 
TRANSPORTATION: WITH COLLAPSE OF FREEWAYS, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CARS ARE BEING 
REROUTED INTO THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Years before the 6.6-magnitude earthquake wreaked havoc on this burgeoning 
bedroom community, Santa Clarita had a miserable problem with traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, the problem went from miserable to monumental. 
</P>
<P>
 With the collapse of portions of the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways 
in the Santa Clarita area, tens of thousands of cars are being rerouted onto 
the city's roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars are inching along Santa Clarita's major arteries at a snail's pace, with 
delays in some areas exceeding two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a lot of complaints because the internal roads that get 
(residents) to the freeways are clogged," said Santa Clarita Mayor George 
Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowded roads are just one of the problems Santa Clarita is facing in the 
wake of the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 City estimates of quake damage in the area were put at $193 million Thursday, 
including $77 million in damage to private property. So far, 50 homes, 
businesses and other structures have been declared uninhabitable and that 
number, along with the dollar value of losses, could rise as inspections 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although water service has been restored almost throughout the city, residents 
can't trust what comes out of the tap. Eleven days after the quake, the area 
remains on an indefinite boil-water order. 
</P>
<P>
 William S. Hart High School, the last of Santa Clarita's public schools to 
remain closed, is expected to open today for its first full day of classes 
since the tremor hit. Because of the heavy traffic on nearby streets, students 
will not be allowed to leave campus for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to roads and bridges in the city is estimated at more than $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of roads that have got cracks in them. We have a lot of damage 
to a lot of our bridges," Pederson said, noting that although some roads have 
had to close, most remain usable. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the city's heaviest-traveled roads escaped damage but are now 
burdened by the extra traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Such major roadways as San Fernando Road, Lyons Avenue and Soledad Canyon Road 
are carrying much more traffic than they are designed to, Pederson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-anticipated opening of two lanes on the southbound Antelope Valley 
Freeway to the Golden State Freeway will not occur today as hoped. Caltrans 
officials Thursday said that the truck lanes, which will provide the first 
direct freeway link from the Santa Clarita Valley to the San Fernando Valley 
since the quake, will be open in time for the Monday morning commute. A bypass 
off the damaged Golden State Freeway onto the Old Road is also expected to be 
ready Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes on the two freeways are continuously affecting Santa Clarita's 
internal road network. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Metrolink, which is helping to keep thousands of cars off the freeways, 
is causing problems in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "People using Metrolink are helping us a great deal but when they get (off the 
train), they've got to get on these small roads," said Sgt. Lee White of the 
Santa Clarita Sheriff's Station.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency has deputies stationed on Soledad Canyon Road at the Metrolink 
station to help with traffic flow, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never expected this much traffic," he said. "It's opened up our eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson said the city has gotten through the disaster stage and is now moving 
into the recovery process, which could take years, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Community Service Food Source today will begin distributing 
non-perishable food from 20 sites throughout the Santa Clarita Valley.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: SURPRISE CANDIDATE FOR A SHAKY POLITICAL LANDSCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SWITCHEROO? According to informed sources, state Assemblywoman Barbara 
Friedman (D-Van Nuys) is expected to announce soon that she will not run for 
state Sen. David Roberti's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, these sources say, the surprise choice of U.S. Reps. Howard Berman 
(D-Panorama City) and Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) to succeed Roberti may be 
75-year-old state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, who, like Friedman, is a veteran 
member of the Berman-Waxman organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal, who now represents the 22nd Senate District, an area that includes 
Hollywood and large chunks of the heavily Latino East Side, has been a 
politician at loose ends since reapportionment stripped him of his old 
Westside-based seat and dropped him unceremoniously on the east side of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Smelling oblivion if he ran for reelection in 1994 on the turf dealt him by 
reapportionment, Rosenthal in 1992 ran for the newly created 23rd Senate 
District. That put him at odds with the ambitions of state Assemblyman Tom 
Hayden, a fellow Democrat. In that bitter matchup, Hayden won. Since then, 
Rosenthal has remained in the Senate, finishing out his term representing the 
22nd District. 
</P>
<P>
 If Friedman shelves her Senate ambitions, it will be a big blow to a number of 
wanna-bes who have been circling around her Assembly seat. These include most 
notably Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein, Deputy City Atty. 
Gary Geuss and Francine Oschin, one of Los Angeles City Councilman Hal 
Bernson's deputies. All were planning to run for Friedman's seat -- if she did 
not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 THE STING: Lost in the crush of earthquake events was a rare vignette of Los 
Angeles' quirky multimillionaire businessman-cum-mayor, Richard Riordan, 
rolling up his shirt-sleeves to play crime-stopper and people's advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Tuesday after the earthquake, the 64-year-old Riordan ended a five-hour 
tour of the Valley in Canoga Park surrounded by a nervous LAPD security detail 
and a large number of low-income Latinos rendered homeless by the quake and 
encamped at the city's Lanark Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the concerns Riordan heard as he wandered amid the smoky campfires of 
the refugees was that local merchants were hiking their prices for essentials, 
including bottled water. So what did Riordan do? Instead of being content to 
pass these price-gouging allegations on to a City Hall bureaucrat, Riordan set 
up an ad hoc sting operation to test the honesty of a few local convenience 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 While the mayor, his security staff, a handful of aides and a few motorcycle 
officers tried to remain inconspicuous, Riordan press deputy Annette Castro 
(too well-dressed to make the ruse work) posed as customer at two stores that 
had been the target of complaints but failed to come up with any evidence of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Can anyone picture ex-mayor Tom Bradley getting involved in such a endearingly 
goofy adventure? 
</P>
<P>
 Footnote: Later in the week, Southland Corp., the parent company for 7-Eleven 
Stores, announced that it was terminating the franchises of eight of its store 
operators in the Valley after its own undercover teams found they were 
overcharging quake victims. Both the stores Riordan tried to sting were 
7-Elevens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 THE VISIBLE ZEV: To political pulse-takers, one recurring media image from the 
Jan. 17 earthquake was that of a glum, mustachioed Los Angeles City Councilman 
Zev Yaroslavsky standing near Mayor Richard Riordan whenever the TV cameras 
rolled. "I'm still trying to figure out why the mayor is letting Zev get so 
much publicity," said one City Hall political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, not only did the enterprising Yaroslavsky position himself to 
be picked up in most camera shots, but also he managed to maintain a fixed look 
of proper grimness throughout long-winded mayoral dissertations on the 
earthquake tragedy.  
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, it should be recalled, is running for the board seat that 
retiring Supervisor Ed Edelman will relinquish later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman represents a sizable portion of the San Fernando Valley. But not all 
of it, as Yaroslavsky has yet to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling with Riordan on a quake-damage inspection tour that took in the 
Northridge Fashion Center, Yaroslavsky asked if the giant mall was south of 
Devonshire and was told that it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would put it in my district," Yaroslavsky said in a remark both wrong 
and presumptuous. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: the Northridge Fashion Center is located miles from 
Yaroslavsky's council district and just a hair outside Edelman's (it's actually 
in Supervisor Mike Antonovich's). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 RECALL REDUX: Roberti's success in portraying his recall opponents as "gun 
extremists" is starting to produce novel dividends and political bedfellows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys Democrat's stand on abortion (he's anti-abortion) coupled with 
his advocacy of stricter gun controls and liberal social record has created a 
certain amount of cognitive dissonance in the women's movement. "We've had a 
love-hate relationship with David," said Judith Hirshberg, president of the San 
Fernando Valley chapter of the National Women's Political Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Roberti being attacked by Second Amendment enthusiasts in a recall 
movement (which qualified for the April 12 ballot this week), Hirshberg reports 
that many of her NWPC members are ready to overlook Roberti's anti-abortion 
position and join the fight to save him from the recall. "I expect most of our 
members to become very active in the keep-Roberti campaign," Hirshberg said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an endorsement by NWPC will elude Roberti (the group only endorses 
women), Roberti can expect the organization to issue a supportive statement and 
urge members to individually work for the senator, Hirshberg said.

SILICON GRAPHICS FOUNDER QUITS TO LAUNCH NEW SOFTWARE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James H. Clark, a former Stanford University professor who pioneered some of 
the most important technologies in contemporary computing, announced Thursday 
that he was stepping down as chairman of Silicon Graphics Inc., the Mountain 
View, Calif.-based company he founded. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark will likely be succeeded by longtime Silicon Graphics Chief Executive Ed 
McCracken, with whom Clark has had a highly productive -- if sometimes 
difficult -- relationship. The mild-mannered Clark, 49, said he is leaving Feb. 
28 to start a new company that will develop software for the nascent 
interactive television market. 
</P>
<P>
 "These opportunities occur every 10 or 15 years -- quantum leaps (in 
technology) that create fundamental new opportunities," Clark said in an 
interview. "Entrepreneurship is the key to emerging technologies." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Clark's achievements at Silicon Graphics count as spectacular 
entrepreneurship. A physicist by training, Clark was teaching at Stanford when 
he recognized a need among scientists for computer tools that would allow them 
to create visual representations of their formulas and models. 
</P>
<P>
 His only previous business experience, he said Thursday, was "a loan business 
in the Navy." But together with six graduate students, he launched Silicon 
Graphics in 1982, and the company pioneered both hardware and software for 
three-dimensional graphics computing. The technology initially was extremely 
expensive and the market tiny, but the firm grew rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, the company's machines were revolutionizing everything from 
Hollywood special effects to automobile design. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clark and McCracken, a former Hewlett-Packard executive who was brought on 
board in 1984, nonetheless had a tough task in defending the company against 
far larger rivals even as it sought to expand beyond its high-end niche. 
</P>
<P>
 An alliance with Compaq Computer crumbled along with an industry consortium 
called ACE. 
</P>
<P>
 Silicon Graphics was later virtually obliged to acquire troubled MIPS Computer 
Systems, a microprocessor company whose chips were needed by Silicon's 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 But revenue and profits continued to climb. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, Clark has pushed to spread the company's graphics 
technologies not only into the mainstream personal computer market, but into 
America's living rooms as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Silicon Graphics is the key technology supplier for the Time Warner 
interactive television trial that will begin later this year in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm is also developing a next-generation video game with Nintendo -- a 
project that aims to bring the power of a 1980s supercomputer into low-cost 
game machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said it was the opportunity to create software for all these new media 
that prompted his departure, noting that his new company would make heavy use 
of Silicon Graphics systems. 
</P>
<P>
 He firmly denied longstanding industry rumors of tension between him and 
McCracken, allegedly a result of McCracken's growing authority at the company. 
"Whatever might have gone around with the wind has been greatly exaggerated," 
Clark said. "There is no conflict . . . I'm going to be doing something that we 
couldn't do here."

LAWYER HELD IN WORKERS' COMP FRAUD; INSURANCE: EIGHT OTHERS ARE ARRESTED IN 
WHAT AUTHORITIES CALL ONE OF THE BIGGEST SUCH SCHEMES IN LOS ANGELES HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Beverly Hills attorney and eight others were arrested Thursday after being 
indicted in what officials are calling one of the biggest workers' compensation 
fraud rings in Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
 The scam, as authorities describe it, allegedly generated phony insurance 
claims worth tens of millions of dollars and was one of the most brazen and 
sophisticated workers' compensation frauds yet uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 It involved a massive telemarketing scheme in which banks of $6-an-hour 
employees would recruit claimants by making "cold calls" to recently unemployed 
people and telling them they might be entitled to monetary benefits from their 
former employers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They targeted the most vulnerable group," said Carol Whyte, a deputy Los 
Angeles district attorney involved in the nearly two-year probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation recruited "many thousands" of claimants, each of whom was 
referred to medical offices where chiropractors and other practitioners ran up 
thousands of dollars in billings for useless procedures, according to Whyte and 
Ed Feldman, acting chief of the district attorney's workers' compensation fraud 
unit, which investigated the case along with the state Insurance Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one case, a man with a legitimate claim was accidentally 
recruited, Whyte said. The man, whose knee had been broken in a warehouse 
accident, was refused care because claimants were being funneled through the 
system so tightly that it would have slowed things down to have to perform 
actual treatment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with spiraling workers' compensation costs -- including those from fraud 
-- the Legislature last year passed legislation to reform the workers' 
compensation system. At the same time, prosecutors have become more aggressive 
in their efforts to root out fraud. Only in the last year have authorities 
succeeded in bringing criminal charges against alleged masterminds of fraud 
schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer charged with devising the scheme -- and who is believed to have 
personally reaped a fortune in kickbacks from the practitioners -- is Robert M. 
Ball, 35, of Beverly Hills. Ball and eight others were arrested Thursday, a day 
after being secretly indicted by a Los Angeles County grand jury, Feldman said. 
The 10th suspect was still at large Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 were charged with felonies that include fraud, conspiracy and receiving 
money for unlawful referrals.  
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested Thursday were Arthur L. Carlisle, 37, a Monterey Park 
chiropractor; Charles Murrel Valyan, 45, a Pasadena chiropractor; George P. 
Rowell, 55, a Lynwood psychologist; Reginald P. Mason, 27, of Los Angeles, 
president of a collection agency called Drexel, Melton & Lynch; Anna R. Harmon, 
28, of Los Angeles; Sam Calvert, 27, of Compton; Ana Fuentes, 21, of Los 
Angeles, and Vince D. Williams, 31, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine suspects were all in custody late Thursday night and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The telemarketers, who were pushed to meet quotas of six to eight claimants a 
day, sometimes worked from printed lists of laid-off workers that included 
telephone and Social Security numbers, as well as names of previous employers. 
When these lists of "prospects" were exhausted, investigators say, the 
telemarketers would be handed torn-out sections of the telephone book and told 
to work their way through those names. 
</P>
<P>
 The callers identified themselves as representatives of the "California 
Employee Protection Agency," a name that investigators say was chosen to make 
people think they were dealing with a state agency. 
</P>
<P>
 When prospects showed interest, they were quickly given appointments with a 
chiropractor, a dentist and a psychologist. The chiropractor billed an average 
of $866 per claimant, the dentist $1,650 and the psychologist $3,000, said Gary 
Hernandez, the deputy insurance commissioner who oversees fraud investigations.

APPLE SOFTWARE TO BE LICENSED TO SOME RIVALS; COMPUTERS: ACCESS TO MACINTOSH 
LINE WILL BE CONDITIONAL ON USING NEW POWERPC MICROPROCESSOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apple Computer Inc., in an important philosophical shift, plans to stop 
hoarding its popular Macintosh software and license it to competing computer 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a catch: Apple, the computing pioneer based in Cupertino, Calif., 
said it will make the user-friendly software available only to makers of 
machines that use the coming PowerPC microprocessor, jointly developed by 
Apple, IBM Corp. and Motorola Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 It will not offer the software to makers of personal computers that use Intel 
chips, which dominate the market, particularly in offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Executive Michael Spindler told shareholders at Apple's annual meeting 
Wednesday that the company is "actively exploring" licensing options. 
</P>
<P>
 Spindler had hinted at such a Macintosh strategy in recent months, and Apple 
took a step away from its isolation philosophy last year, when it licensed the 
technology for its new Newton hand-held computing and communications device. 
</P>
<P>
 One analyst said it is significant that Apple has publicly committed itself to 
a strategy for challenging Intel's dominance of the market and boosting its own 
flagging fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Apple doesn't get its software licensed, it will be doomed to single-digit 
market share for the foreseeable future," said Rich Bader, an industry analyst 
in Beaverton, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Machines that use Intel chips as their "brains" and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 
operating software hold overwhelming leads in the corporate and home-use 
markets. Dataquest Inc., a San Jose research firm, projects that U.S. sales of 
machines based on Intel's Pentium family of chips and its clones will soar to 
21 million by 1997, three times more than projections for PowerPC machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel's dominance is encountering fierce challenges, however. In a blow to the 
giant Wednesday, Compaq Computer Corp. pledged to buy some microprocessors from 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a key Intel rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Of machines already in use, 39 million use Intel chips and 6.8 million are 
Macintoshes containing Motorola chips. Apple has billed the PowerPC as offering 
"twice the performance of Pentium for half the price," but Intel has recently 
taken aggressive steps to reduce its prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion is divided as to how much licensing would help Apple, which has been 
troubled by management turnover, blistering price competition and a sour 
reception for the Newton. Apple's stock has tumbled from a high of $62 a share 
last January. In trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Apple shares rose 62.5 
cents Thursday, to close at $34.125 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Apple is expected to release its first Macintosh machines based on the PowerPC 
in March. Other manufacturers are likely to sit back for a time until they see 
how the PowerPC fares against Intel's new Pentium chip. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with the Hambrecht & Quist investment firm in San 
Francisco, said there is no guarantee that other computer companies will want 
the Macintosh operating software. And he questioned Apple's motives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is whether there are new opportunities in emerging markets," he 
said. "If Apple is trying to position itself against Windows in the corporate 
world, it doesn't make sense."

TAKING AIM AT THE BAD ADS; GROUP SAYS FINE PRINT BELIES WHAT PRODUCTS TOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tiny print carrying the bad news in ads -- virtually hidden at the bottom of 
the TV screen or page -- was a favorite marketing ploy used by many of the 
nation's top advertisers last year. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the conclusion of the consumer advocacy group Center for Science in 
the Public Interest, which handed out its ninth annual "Lemon Awards" on 
Thursday for "Worst Ads of 1993." The group said ads carrying tiny print ranked 
among the most misleading and irresponsible of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bold promises in many of the cited ads were often contradicted by their small 
print, the center said. Among the biggest culprits, it said, were American 
Honda, Northwest Airlines and Hasbro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small print cannot justify an otherwise misleading claim," said Bruce 
Silverglade, legal director of the center. "The only way to read the small 
print in most TV spots is to videotape it, freeze-frame it and look at it with 
a magnifying glass." 
</P>
<P>
 The center's bad ad awards are a public relations nightmare for most 
companies, which frequently face days of embarrassment following the citations. 
The privately funded center, started on a shoestring in 1971, has amassed 
considerable political power over the years, helped in part by the publicity 
from its Lemon Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 But the center itself is also the subject of criticism. Some have accused the 
group of trying to garner publicity -- as well as donations -- by hosting this 
ad-bashing ceremony each year. Center executives say the best way to keep a 
close watch on advertisers would be to name a consumer advocate to fill a 
soon-to-open commissioner's post on the Federal Trade Commission. But those 
interests might appear to be somewhat self-serving, because group co-founder 
Michael Jacobson has previously stated an interest in that post. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at the center insist that they are only looking out for what's best 
for consumers. And at Thursday's ceremony in Washington, officials said that 
too many consumers are being misled by new forms of deceptive advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 For help in selecting the worst offenders, the center sought the aid of 
several consumer groups that specialize in specific areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the center were particularly irked by a Honda car lease spot that 
they say seduces viewers with a promise that it is "designed to improve cash 
flow." While the ad promises payments of $199 a month, the small print notes 
charges that add up to much more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of 'designed to improve cash flow,' the slogan for the lease ads 
should be 'designed to obscure the true cost,' " said Debra Barclay, 
communications director for the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group that 
selected the Honda ad as the most offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda denies that the commercial is misleading. "Obviously, no one is going to 
lease a car based on a single TV spot," spokesman Mike Spencer said. "The ad 
meets all legal, ethical and moral requirements."  
</P>
<P>
 Only the tiniest print in an ad for Northwest Airlines revealed that the 
promised "incredible vacation fares" -- which appeared to be offered over a 
three-month period -- were actually available for just 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'incredible vacation fares' are so incredible that for most would-be 
travelers, they don't exist," said Geraldine Frankoski, director of the 
Aviation Consumer Action Project, a Washington-based group affiliated with 
consumer activist Ralph Nader, which selected the offending ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest insists that it wasn't loose with the facts. "We don't feel that is 
misleading," spokesman Jim Faulkner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center said an ad by toy maker Hasbro is especially misleading because it 
targets a vulnerable group -- children. The TV commercial depicts toy cowboys 
in a snazzy Western town -- but the toy town is not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toy is targeted to children who are too young to read," pointed out Bill 
Wood, consumer advocate for U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which selected 
the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Hasbro says the TV spot is perfectly clear. The toy is sold via 
a toll-free phone number. And the company has only received two calls from 
consumers who think the toy Western town is for sale, said Wayne Charness, vice 
president at Hasbro. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from too much small print, the center found lots of other misleading 
statements in ads over the past year. Two of its biggest industry culprits were 
makers of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
 It was harshly critical of a print ad for Kool cigarettes that features an 
attractive woman in high heels next to the headline "Totally Kool." Center 
officials said the ad implies that smoking can somehow add to sexual 
attraction.  
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for Brown & Williamson, maker of Kool cigarettes, said the ad 
"conforms to the code in every way." 
</P>
<P>
 The center also accused brewer Anheuser-Busch of violating the beer industry's 
own code that prohibits ads showing beer being consumed illegally. In an ad for 
its Bud Light brand, a man is shown riding in the back of a limousine while 
holding an open bottle of Bud Light. But having an open container in a moving 
vehicle is illegal in some states. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is ridiculous to over-analyze what is meant to be humorous," said Francine 
Katz, director of consumer awareness at Anheuser-Busch. 'Worst Ads' of 1993 
</P>
<P>
 This list of "the most misleading, unfair and irresponsible" advertising of 
1993 was compiled by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a 
Washington-based consumer organization. The ads were selected by category. 
</P>

Misrepresents dates for low fares. Company response: Ad "clearly states" there 
are limitations on low fares. * 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Category: Dietary supplements Advertiser: Nature's Plus How ad may be 
misleading: Claims its Source of Life supplement delivers "an incredible burst 
of energy." Company response: Consumers can get money back if they do not feel

 Durable Goods Orders Up Sharply: Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods 
jumped 8.6% in 1993, the biggest advance in five years, which included a 
broad-based 2.2% increase in December, the Commerce Department reported. The 
department said the annual increase was the steepest since orders rose 9.6% in 
1988, despite the sixth consecutive drop in defense orders.In December, orders 
set a new record, totaling a seasonally adjusted $142.8 billion, up from the 
previous high of $139.7 billion a month earlier. It was the fifth consecutive 
monthly advance, the longest string since 1987. In another economic report, the 
Labor Department said the number of Americans applying for initial unemployment 
benefits declined by 56,000 last week, due in part to the effects of frigid 
weather, a federal holiday and the Northridge earthquake.

ISRAEL WILL BUY 20 F-15E FIGHTER JETS; DEFENSE: MCDONNELL DOUGLAS WINS THE 
$2-BILLION ORDER DESPITE A HEAVY PUSH BY RIVAL LOCKHEED TO SELL ITS F-16. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending months of suspense, Israel announced Thursday that it will buy 20 F-15E 
fighters from McDonnell Douglas Corp. for $2 billion instead of acquiring 
Lockheed Corp.'s F-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great day for McDonnell Douglas and the F-15 program," said John P. 
Capellupo, McDonnell's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli order was a major blow to Calabasas-based Lockheed, which had 
lobbied hard to sell Israel 42 of its F-16 fighters. Lockheed Chairman Daniel 
M. Tellep had personally met with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to push 
the F-16. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell's victory will have little, if any, impact on aerospace employment 
in Southern California. McDonnell builds the F-15E at its headquarters in St. 
Louis, and Lockheed assembles the F-16 in Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Lockheed hoped an Israeli order would help extend the life of the 
F-16 because the U.S. Defense Department has said it will not buy any more of 
the planes after this year. Lockheed still has a backlog of about 600 orders 
for F-16s, enough to keep production going through most of this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disappointed," Gordon England, president of Lockheed's Ft. Worth 
division, said. "We don't understand the decision criteria, since it apparently 
wasn't based on price or performance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli Embassy in Washington issued a statement noting that the order 
"ends the long and challenging process of evaluation" of the two jets, 
including comparisons of their cost and performance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the embassy did not say what factors gave the F-15E the edge, and 
officials of the embassy and Israel's Defense Ministry declined to elaborate. 
The order, which is being financed by U.S. grants to Israel, includes both the 
jets and support equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle for Israel's order took on added importance over the past year 
because, as defense spending keeps dropping worldwide, it looked to be the last 
foreign order for U.S. fighters of its size for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell appeared to have the sale locked up last fall, in part because the 
F-15 can fly the long distances Israel wants to reach potential enemies such as 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lockheed, aided by the Tellep-Rabin meeting in November, persuaded Israel 
to give Lockheed time to compete with a newly configured F-16 that also had a 
longer range. 
</P>
<P>
 In buying the F-15E instead, Israel followed Saudi Arabia's order of 72 F-15s 
in 1992, and the Saudi deal probably contributed to Israel's choice, Reich 
said. But he said the F-15 won mainly because it has two engines -- compared to 
the single-engine F-16.

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks streaked to new highs Thursday, as fear of rising interest rates 
receded and investors focused on the outlook for improving corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term Treasury bond yields dropped sharply, even after positive economic 
news that ordinarily would tend to boost interest rates. Gold prices plunged. 
Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials jumped 18.30 points to a new high of 3,926.30 as 
computerized program buying intensified an early rally. 
</P>
<P>
 New government reports of solid economic growth -- in particular, word of a 
surge in orders for durable goods in December -- provided a positive backdrop 
to the session. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, strength in the bond market, combined with a sudden rally in recently 
depressed utility stocks, helped put investors in a buying mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Among broader market indexes, the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 
2.12 points to a record 264.38, exceeding its previous high of 263.20 set Jan. 
20. And the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index jumped 3.85 points to a record 
477.05, topping the previous record of 475.27 set Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 On the NYSE, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 5 to 3 as 
volume ballooned to 346.50 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said an unusually strong rebound in utility stocks indicated that 
investors may be losing their fears that interest rates will head significantly 
higher in the near future. The Dow utility index leaped 4.15 points, or 1.9%, 
to 225.61. The index had fallen to a 52-week low earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the market reflects renewed optimism about the outlook for interest 
rates," said Michael Metz, analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow was boosted by AlliedSignal, up 7/8 to 78; Dupont, up 1 to 55 1/8; 
GE, up 1 3/4 to 108 1/4, and Caterpillar, up 2 1/4 to 101 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Gains in those stocks helped offset a drop of 3 3/4 to 107 1/4 in shares of 
3M, after it reported lower than expected quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also helping the Dow: AT&T posted fourth-quarter earnings in line with Wall 
Street expectations, and the stock rose 3/4 to 56 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * The rally in auto stocks revived. Ford rose 1 7/8 to 66 3/4, Chrysler gained 
7/8 to 60 1/2 and GM added 1 1/4 to 59 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electric utility stocks rebounding sharply included American Electric Power, 
up 5/8 to 36 1/2; Houston Industries, up 1 1/8 to 45 3/8, and SCEcorp, up 1/2 
to 19 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone stocks also surged. Southwestern Bell jumped 1 5/8 to 41, BellSouth 
gained 1 7/8 to 60 and Nynex added 1 to 41. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among classic growth stocks, Callaway Golf soared 4 1/8 to 62 5/8 after 
reporting sharply higher quarterly earnings. Also, drug maker Schering-Plough 
added 3/4 to 64 3/8 on its earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's losers, Sara Lee slumped 1 1/2 to 23 1/2. It reported 
improved second-quarter earnings but said third-quarter results might fall 
short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold stocks tumbled as bullion prices fell. ASA dropped 2 1/8 to 51 3/8, 
American Barrick slid 7/8 to 27 3/8 and Placer Dome plummeted 1 5/8 to 24 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, Mexico City's Bolsa index ended at a record 2,712.91, up 
53.62 points. Telmex's NYSE shares gained 2 1/2 to 71 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, stocks ended a day of seesaw trading lower, with the Nikkei average 
off 246.42 points at 18,891.79. In London, the FTSE-100 index eased 8.8 points 
to 3,427.3; Frankfurt's DAX average added 5.97 points to 2,125.14. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, traders and investors apparently focused on plummeting 
gold prices, which allayed some concerns that inflation was likely to rise from 
last year's low levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The main 30-year bond yield fell to 6.26% from 6.30% the day before, pushing 
prices up 5/8 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of shorter-term maturities posted smaller gains. Short-term Treasury 
securities rose 1/16 point and intermediate maturities rose 1/8 point to 5/16 
point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the gains came in an afternoon rally, hours after the Commerce 
Department reported that orders to factories for durable goods jumped 8.6% in 
1993 -- the biggest advance in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market largely ignored the report, which was viewed as old news by 
many participants, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also largely brushed off was a Labor Department report that the number of 
initial applications for unemployment benefits declined by 56,000 last week. 
Much of that was considered an aberration due to the effects of frigid weather, 
a federal holiday and the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, many participants focused on the plunging price of gold. The metal is 
used by many investors as a hedge against inflation. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Gold futures prices tumbled to an eight-week low as weakening inflation 
signals prompted investors to shift funds from precious metals into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold plunged $7.20 on New York's Comex to $377.40 an ounce, the lowest daily 
settlement since Dec. 2. Silver skidded 15.6 cents to $4.967 an ounce, a 
seven-week low. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, light, sweet crude oil for March delivery slipped 5 cents on the 
New York Merc to $15.42 a barrel as traders took profits from Wednesday's 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar fell to its lowest closing level against the Japanese 
yen in seven weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed down at 108.55 Japanese yen.

STOCK MUTUAL FUNDS DRAWING RECORD CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stock mutual funds finished 1993 with a flourish by attracting record cash 
inflows in December. 
</P>
<P>
 But bond fund purchases continued to be relatively weak, a sign of investor 
concern about a potential rise in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Investment Company Institute, a trade group for the funds, reported 
Thursday that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Net new cash flow into stock funds in December was $14.5 billion. It was the 
highest monthly total ever and substantially above $9.0 billion in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Net new cash flow measures net dollars received by the funds, less investor 
redemptions, reinvested dividends and exchanges among funds in the same 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 * For bond funds, net new cash flow was $5.8 billion in December, up from $4.1 
billion in November but down significantly from a $10.8-billion average inflow 
in the first eight months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the full year, both stock and bond fund inflows were a record. Stock 
funds took in $128.2 billion, far more than the previous record of $77.9 
billion in 1992. Bond funds took in $113.6 billion, edging out the record of 
$108.7 billion set in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fund assets at year-end topped the $2 trillion mark for the first time, 
reaching $2.01 trillion, up from $1.98 trillion at the end of November. Total 
fund assets include money market funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The December surge in stock fund purchases was led by renewed interest in 
growth-and-income funds, which typically favor larger, conservative stocks. 
Total purchases of those funds, less reinvested dividends, was $6.06 billion in 
December, up from $5.01 billion in November. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this month, many fund companies say, stock fund purchases have remained 
strong. Record Year for Funds 
</P>
<P>
 Net new cash flow into stock and bond mutual funds set records in 1993. Net 
new cash flow measures net fund purchases minus redemptions and adjusted for 
exchanges among funds.

FORD WILL LAUNCH USED-CAR LEASING BUSINESS; CARS: THE AUTO MAKER, ALREADY 
AGGRESSIVE IN LEASES, SEES THE MOVE AS A WAY TO BUILD LOYALTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to keep customers from jumping to other brands, Ford Motor Co. 
said Thursday that it will launch a used-car leasing business, a move that 
could drastically alter car-buying habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, which is expected to be unveiled next week at the Chicago Auto 
Show, Ford dealers would lease used vehicles to customers with the help of Ford 
Motor Credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, if Ford dealers wanted to lease used cars, they had to obtain 
financing from an outside source, such as a local bank. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with the explosion in leasing volume this year, Ford officials have 
decided to extend special low-rate financing terms to used vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford has been the most aggressive of Detroit's Big Three in the leasing 
business, offering a variety of short-term lease deals with attractive monthly 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been a dramatic increase in lease deals over the past few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to CNW Marketing/Research, a Bandon, Ore., group that tracks leasing 
trends, almost 28% of all cars sold in America last year were leased, up from 
19.6% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Spinella, vice president of CNW, predicted the figure will level off near 
40% by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way they're talking about controlling the vehicle from the day it's born 
until the day it dies, that number may be small," Spinella said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't see that happening. There's still a very ingrained sense that 
someone wants to own their vehicle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts say the push into used-car leasing is another way for Ford 
to strengthen the bond between the dealer and the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Spinella said loyalty rates for purchased cars are typically about 10%. But 
when a car is leased, the loyalty jumps to almost 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you control the customer base, you obviously control, to a better 
extent, the loyalty to the nameplate," Spinella said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have first opportunity to do something with that customer and not have to 
worry half as much about one of your competitors getting the names of your 
customer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Ford Chairman Alex Trotman said leasing is a key part of Ford's 
sales strategy because it allows dealers to sell or lease another vehicle when 
customers return their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Trotman said, customers would buy a car and then "disappear in the 
woodwork," making it difficult for car makers to maintain owner loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to overcome that, Ford has been experimenting with a variety of lease 
deals, including a program in Nevada that offers a new car every two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Cedergren, an industry consultant for AutoPacific Group, said there are 
some 40 million cars over 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a hell of a lot of junkers out there that need to be replaced, and 
those people are not going to buy new cars," Cedergren said. "They're going to 
buy used, and this is one way for Ford to tap that market." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said Ford will probably have to extend the warranty on the 
vehicles and keep the monthly payments below $200 to attract buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. already offers a used-car lease program, but it has not 
been heavily promoted.  
</P>
<P>
 Other auto makers, including Mercedes-Benz and Toyota's Lexus, offer similar 
programs.

 Next Intel Chip to Arrive in 1995: The company is again speeding up the 
frenetic pace of change in the personal computer industry.Intel Corp. Chief 
Executive Andrew S. Grove said in a speech to financial analysts that the 
company will demonstrate its next-generation microchip, known internally as P6, 
this time next year. The announcement has little effect on current computer 
buyers, but it is important to the strategies of PC makers and software 
writers. Intel microprocessors are the "brain" in four out of five PCs. Intel 
is just hitting full production of the state-of-the-art Pentium chip.

 GM's California Sales Surge: General Motors Corp. said retail sales in 
California increased 30.6% in the first quarter of the 1994 model year, 
reflecting the impact of its "value pricing" program designed to win back 
market share in the state. Sales for the entire industry were up 7.5% in 
California for the October-to-December period, the company said.The sales 
increase allowed GM to capture 21.5% of the California market, up about four 
points from a year ago. Nationwide, GM holds 33.6% of the market. Under value 
pricing, the company sets a fixed price for a well-equipped car by cutting 
dealer discounts and profit margins. The figures, which are based on data from 
J.D. Power & Associates, do not include fleet sales.

lost more than $116 million on sales of $2.5 billion last year, said it 
suspended the payout "to strengthen the company's financial and competitive 
position."Teledyne had been paying 20 cents a share quarterly, and the 
dividends totaled $44.3 million in 1993. The announcement came after the stock 
markets closed. Earlier, Teledyne's stock had climbed 25 cents to $25.75 a

HEALTH PLAN WON'T BE TOO COSTLY, ECONOMISTS SAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobel laureate economist Robert M. Solow said Thursday that fears that the 
costs in President Clinton's health care proposals would cripple small 
businesses are exaggerated, even as the Clinton Administration seemed to be 
backpedaling on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Solow said there would be an adverse impact on small businesses, but he 
suggested it would be short-lived as the new system took effect.Solow, an 
economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was one of 
several leading economists attending a conference on monetary policy sponsored 
by the Claremont Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobel Prize winner James Tobin, emeritus Sterling Professor of Economics at 
Yale University, said: "The economy can do OK, in general, whether or not the 
Clinton plan is passed. It's not going to kill the economy and it's not going 
to make a big difference the other way, either. It's not a big macroeconomic 
issue."

VALENTI PRODS TV EXECS TO RESTRICT VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motion Picture Assn. of America President Jack Valenti on Thursday urged TV 
executives to take more responsibility for television violence and "act as if 
TV is indeed a major factor in antisocial behavior."Valenti's remarks to the 
National Assn. of Television Program Executives appeared aimed at prodding 
executives to voluntarily restrict such violence before federal authorities do. 
He said the industry has "an obligation to be responsible for what we conceive, 
accountable to our lucid, moral instincts." Separately, a group of actors, 
authors, publishers and others said they have formed a coalition to fight 
legislative restrictions on TV violence.

 Insiders in the Michael Jackson camp are citing a strengthened relationship 
between the superstar and his manager, Sandy Gallin, who maintained a strong 
behind-the-scenes presence as his client battled allegations of molesting a 
13-year-old boy. Gallin, attorney John Branca and business manager Marshall 
Gelfond have emerged from the controversy as Jackson's core inner circle and 
will now spearhead efforts to resolve a lawsuit brought against Jackson by 
promoter Marcel Avram over canceled international concert dates.Insiders are 
looking for a multimillion-dollar settlement or a rescheduling of the shows.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Miramax Films confirmed that its longtime distribution chief, Marty Zeidman, 
will leave the company soon.  
</P>

EARNINGS: GREAT WESTERN NARROWS QUARTERLY LOSS; AT&T'S PROFIT SLIPS 
</P>

<P>
 Great Western Bank reported a loss of $18.2 million in the fourth quarter, an 
improvement over the $97.3 million the savings and loan said it lost in the 
final three months of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss resulted primarily from loan-loss provisions of $149 million and a 
restructuring charge of $30 million, attributable to separation costs relating 
to planned layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western took the loss provisions as part of a continuing campaign to 
clean out bad loans. It disposed of $1.6 billion in problem assets in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The S&L reported an annual profit of $62 million, compared to $85 million it 
earned in 1992. Great Western, the nation's second-largest savings and loan, 
with more than $38 billion in assets, had loan-loss charges of $555 million 
last year, compared to write-offs of $640 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts, who expected the quarterly loss, praised the thrift for bringing its 
problem loans down to manageable levels and for its continuing restructuring 
that will help reduce its annual overhead by as much as $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very enthused by what I've seen," said analyst Bruce Harting at Salomon 
Bros. "I no longer feel like I'm out on a limb recommending the company." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, such as Peter Treadway of Smith Barney, Harris Upham, noted that 
falling interest rates have hurt Great Western's interest income and that 
higher than expected loan-loss provisions in the fourth quarter indicate 
lingering loan problems. "I'd have to call it a disappointing quarter," 
Treadway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Chatsworth-based S&L confirmed that it will cut 1,000 jobs, or 
25% of its administrative staff, during the next year in a bid to cut its 
costs. The strategy is expected o require about 500 layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western shares closed up 37.5 cents to $19.25 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading. CHRIS KRAUL

NEW LINE TO JOIN TED TURNER EMPIRE TODAY; FILM: WITH MORE MONEY, THE COMPANY IS 
LIKELY TO ADD A FEW BIG MOVIES TO ITS ANNUAL PRODUCTION SCHEDULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometime this morning, New Line Cinema becomes something of a new company. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for distributing films ranging from the schlocky "Nightmare on Elm 
Street" series to Robert Altman's critically acclaimed "The Player," New Line 
is expected to formally be absorbed into Turner Broadcasting System when 
shareholders approve the deal at a special meeting in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the company, whose motto has been "prudent aggression," will 
find itself with deep pockets, a luxury enjoyed by few companies that must be 
prudent. Observers believe that's likely to make the film distributor and 
producer a much more aggressive player in Hollywood in both making films and 
acquiring them for release to theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, New Line Chairman and founder Robert Shaye says linking with 
Turner will allow New Line to add to its production schedule two to four 
pictures a year in the $20-million-to-$35-million budget range, significantly 
up from its typical limit of about $15 million. That will give the company the 
flexibility to make broad-appeal pictures with major stars. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Turner's deep pockets give the company increased access to 
feature film deals being shopped around. All told, Shaye expects New Line to 
produce or pick up roughly 25 movies a year, with another 10 being released 
through its Fine Line Features unit that specializes in art house films. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Line acquisition was one of two major deals that cable entrepreneur 
Turner made last summer in exchange for some $700 million in stock and cash, 
which will help him build what will, in effect, be another studio, sans lot and 
sound stages. The deal enhances the potential of Turner's library of films and 
television programming, and it provides more films for his cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner already has a huge library of films, having acquired the old 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library in the mid-1980s. With New Line, he gets a 
well-known distribution company. 
</P>
<P>
 He also last year agreed to acquire a top film and television producer in 
Castle Rock Entertainment, known for such hits as "A Few Good Men," "In the 
Line of Fire" and the sitcom "Seinfeld." Finally, Turner continues to build his 
Turner Pictures unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It dawned on me that there probably is only one person who could create a 
virtual studio, who has all of this except for the real estate. And that is 
Ted," said Shaye, whose New Line stock Thursday was worth nearly $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One open question, however, is how much interaction there will be among New 
Line, Castle Rock and other parts of the Turner film empire. Sources at this 
point suggest there may be very little. 
</P>
<P>
 Castle Rock executives are fiercely independent and have indicated they want 
to eventually build some kind of distribution system of their own after the 
1997 expiration of its agreement with Columbia Pictures, which now distributes 
Castle Rock films. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible scenario is that Castle Rock and New Line will have their own 
marketing and distribution executives, perhaps sharing some parts of a common 
distribution apparatus in the Turner empire. 
</P>
<P>
 One notion Shaye and his chief lieutenant, New Line President Michael Lynne, 
are eager to dispel is that New Line had to make the deal to survive. Because 
they are frequently strapped for money, independents in Hollywood have a high 
mortality rate. Acquisitions are common as well, such as the purchase last year 
of New Line rival Miramax by Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaye says New Line could have made it on its own. According to the company's 
prospectus, New Line's revenue for 1993 was about $292 million, with a profit 
of $16 million; 1994 revenue is projected at $396 million on profit of $23 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our profit picture was the best it had ever been," Shaye says.

 American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it earned $982 million in the fourth 
quarter after special charges as long-distance volume and equipment sales 
improved. The performance met AT&T's goals, and a top executive said the 
company aims for a repeat in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T earned 72 cents per share in the three months ended Dec. 31. It earned $1 
billion, or 75 cents per share, in the same period of 1992. Revenue was $18.46 
billion, up 5.5% from $17.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Special charges for an accounting rule change and restructuring its computer 
subsidiary cut the New York firm's profit by $167 million. Without them, the 
company would have earned $1.15 billion, or 85 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines and Delta Air Lines narrowed their losses in the final three 
months of the year, helped by lower fuel prices, higher revenues and a windfall 
of business from the strike at American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 United's parent company, UAL Inc., lost $64 million, or $3.02 per share, on 
revenue of $3.64 billion in the fourth quarter. A year earlier, the company 
lost $224 million, or $9.27 per share, on revenue of $3.20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Based solely on the expenses of running the business, Chicago-based United had 
an operating profit of $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
 United said its short routes, where the new competitors pose the biggest 
challenge, continued to be a drag on earnings. The airline has agreed to sell 
itself to employees as part of a plan to create a more efficient subsidiary to 
take on the cheap-ticket start-ups.

LONG, SAYING 13 SEASONS IS LONG ENOUGH, RETIRES; PRO FOOTBALL: DEFENSIVE 
LINEMAN, WHO IS THE LAST ACTIVE OAKLAND RAIDER, LEAVES AT AGE 34 "TO GET ON 
WITH LIFE." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Howie Long, last of the Oakland Raiders, a member of the team's last Super 
Bowl-winning squad and one of the game's premier defensive linemen over the 
last 13 seasons, has played his last down for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Long announced his retirement Thursday at a news conference at Super Bowl 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said that although he had toyed with ending his career since late in the 
season, he didn't decide until Wednesday night, when he learned he had been 
added to this year's AFC Pro Bowl squad by Coach Marty Schottenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to get on with life," Long said. "It's time to grow up. I've been 
very fortunate. I've been very lucky. God has blessed me. I've made more money 
than I ever dreamof making. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having won a world championship, having done just about everything there is 
to do in sports from a defensive lineman's standpoint, having a great time and 
finishing up at this point in my career in the Pro Bowl at 34, that is, in my 
mind, the way I think you should leave sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen too many players who I have a great deal of respect and admiration 
for, (people) I looked up to growing up and watched on film, and then I watched 
them deteriorate physically, but try to hang on too long. That was always 
disappointing and hard to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would much rather people say, 'The guy went out as a Pro Bowl player. He 
could have played two or three more years,' than having them say, 'He should 
have gotten out two years ago.' Many players talk about (retiring before their 
skills diminish), but very few accomplish it." 
</P>
<P>
 Long envisioned the alternative and chose to call it quits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't take criticism well," he said. "I would hate to have (Coach) Art 
Shell call me in and say, 'You've lost a step and we're going to bring you in 
off the bench.' I'd be embarrassed as hell. . . . I don't think I could bear 
not playing well. It would be hell for me not to be the go-to guy. . . . It's 
all or nothing, and I'm proud of the fact that, at 34, I took every snap, I 
played every down and was considered one of the best players in the league at 
what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he thoroughly enjoyed his career, he also seemed relieved Thursday to 
finally give his body a rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got drafted by the Raiders, I was 20 years old," Long said. "I'm 34. 
I've been hitting people for a long time. I've been operated on seven times. I 
know my wife's tired of being in post-op, waiting. I'm tired of being in 
pre-op, waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of wears on you. You've got to trick yourself mentally to stay at 
that level." 
</P>
<P>
 Long had no guarantee he would ever reach that level after playing 
collegiately at Villanova, hardly a high-profile football school. 
</P>
<P>
 He was added to the roster for the 1980 Blue-Gray game, filling in for an 
injured player. Long made the most of it, being voted the game's most valuable 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Long was so eager to make the pros, he can recall working out for scouts on 
his front lawn on a Sunday at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, it paid off. Long was drafted in the second round in 1981 by the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 He agreed to a salary of $37,000 for his first season, bought a used car in 
Tucson on his way out west and drove into Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 And there he ran into the reality of pro football in the form of Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell wasn't Long's coach in those days. He was a future Hall of Fame tackle 
and the man Long faced in a drill on his first day in camp. Shell cracked 
Long's cheekbone and hit him with a fist to the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a shock, believe me, because there was no one on the Delaware team (a 
Villanova opponent) like Art Shell," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Long, there weren't too many like Shell in the NFL, either. 
Long went on to be named first team on the All-NFL team of the 1980s, played in 
179 games, recorded 91 1/2 sacks and was a member of the Raider squad that beat 
the Washington Redskins in the 1984 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Long was not a dominating player but, with rising stars like 
Anthony Smith, Nolan Harrison and Chester McGlockton around him, could still be 
a force. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pro Bowl on Feb. 6 will be Long's eighth, tying him for the team record 
with Shell, who has been such a big part of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, who had a contract through the 1996 season, held out last summer, 
finally reporting when the Raiders agreed to adjust his deal, paying him more 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Long had no idea at the time, he said, that it would be his last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Having made his decision Wednesday night, Long said, he was not able to get in 
touch with owner Al Davis before Thursday's announcement, but hoped to meet 
with him today in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's somewhat of a surprise," Raider executive assistant Al LoCasale said. "I 
thought he was committed to the Raiders for the next three years under his last 
contract. But if this is what he wants to do, we certainly wish him well." 
</P>
<P>
 Long plans to spend more time with his wife, Diane, and three young boys and 
will pursue dual careers as a football analyst and actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Present at Thursday's farewell was former linemate Bill Pickel, one of many 
players Long took under his expansive wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like going to school," Pickel said. "He treated you like family. If 
you played basketball, you wanted to be like Mike. If you played football, you 
wanted to be like Howie."

COMMENTARY; HARDING'S ACTION/INACTION IS ANYTHING BUT OLYMPIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks from Saturday, during the opening ceremony of the 1994 Winter Games 
in Lillehammer, Norway, one of the host country's cross-country skiers, Vegard 
Ulvang, will step forward to deliver the athletes' oath: 
</P>
<P>
 "In the name of all the competitors, I promise that we shall take part in 
these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules which govern them, in 
the true spirit of sportsmanship for the glory of sport and the honor of our 
teams." 
</P>
<P>
 If figure skater Tonya Harding is allowed the privilege of participating in 
the Winter Olympics, I cannot believe it will be possible for her to recite 
that oath without words such as sportsmanship, glory and honor getting stuck in 
her throat. 
</P>
<P>
 With her admission Thursday that she learned afterward that persons close to 
her had been responsible for the attack Jan. 6 on Olympic teammate Nancy 
Kerrigan but chose not to report the information to law enforcement 
authorities, it became clear that she had failed in her responsibility as a 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, she failed in her responsibility as an Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in a cynical age in which many athletes are running as fast as they can 
to distance themselves from the idea that they should be role models, becoming 
little more than highly paid shoe salesmen, the public perceives that there 
still is something special about Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
 Track and field athletes often complain that the media report abuses of 
anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs in that sport as 
scandals while paying relatively little attention to the same abuses in sports 
such as football. My answer is that track and field, because of its connection 
to the Olympics, is -- and should be -- held to a higher standard. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who might eventually be called upon to contribute to a ruling on 
Harding's Olympic status, Anita DeFrantz, a member of the U.S. Olympic 
Committee's executive committee and the International Olympic Committee's 
executive board, was unwilling Thursday to offer either personal or 
professional opinions about the specifics of this particular situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking generally, however, she said, "The Olympics work because people 
believe in them. If people stop believing in them, they're going to cease to 
exist. They'll become just another track meet." 
</P>
<P>
 To assure that people continue believing is the obligation of the IOC, the 
USOC and other governing bodies associated with them, including the U.S. Figure 
Skating Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Each has a code of conduct, which enables it to take action against athletes 
or others associated with the team, such as coaches, trainers or doctors, whose 
behavior is contrary to that expected of Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the USOC's code, "All members of the official delegation shall 
conduct themselves in conformity with the traditions of the Olympic Games and 
in such a manner that you bring credit and honor to yourself, your teammates, 
your national governing body, the United States Olympic Committee and the 
United States of America." 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC has used its code of conduct to discipline athletes for a wide 
variety of offenses, from testing positive for banned drugs to stealing a 
decorative mask from the wall of a hotel lobby in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 USOC officials said Thursday they could use the code of conduct to remove 
Harding from the team. 
</P>
<P>
 They should. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Thursday that her lawyers advised her that failing to report her 
knowledge of a crime is not a crime. The district attorney of Multnomah County, 
Ore., might argue otherwise. Some lawyers contend that obstruction-of-justice 
issues could be raised. But regardless of the legal ramifications, she 
committed a crime against the tenets of sportsmanship and fair play. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that her action, or non-action, was motivated in part by fear, but 
part of being an Olympian is having the courage to do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 After Harding won the women's title in the recent U.S. championships, she said 
her motivation for wanting to become the Olympic gold medalist was "the dollar 
signs in my head." If she was willing to accept the potential riches that come 
with being associated with the Olympics, she must also accept the 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * HARDING'S ADMISSION: Skater says she didn't tell authorities what she 
learned about the attack on Nancy Kerrigan. U.S. Olympic Committee is "deeply 
concerned." A1

JIM MURRAY: THE COACH AND THE DIPLOMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody has been able to figure out why Marv Levy is a football coach except 
he's good at it. Jimmy Johnson couldn't be anything else but. 
</P>
<P>
 Marv Levy reads Dickens and Shakespeare. Jimmy Johnson never read anything in 
his life that didn't have X's and O's in it, and dotted lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Marv Levy is a very modest man, grateful to be coach of the Bills. Jimmy 
Johnson thinks the Cowboys are lucky to have him. They probably are. 
</P>
<P>
 Marv Levy is a good coach. Jimmy Johnson may be a great one. 
</P>
<P>
 Marv Levy runs a football team the way Plato might. Jimmy Johnson runs one the 
way Jesse James might. 
</P>
<P>
 You know how football coaches as a class are. The season opens, they say, "We 
may not make a first down." They have 90 of the finest athletes on the planet 
under their command, but they tell the world they have their work cut out for 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 Not Johnson. He goes into the most important football game of the season and 
announces his team is going to kick the San Francisco 49ers' butts. Calls up a 
radio station personally to make sure they get the message. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't even be close," he vows. 
</P>
<P>
 It is such a shocking breach of the coaches' oath that the world figures Jimmy 
Johnson has become suicidal. Not at all. He just wants his players to know he 
has confidence in them.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little different from your clone coach," Johnson boasts. "If you want a 
clone coach who gets up here and says the same thing every day, just get 
yourself a cutout and a tape recording. But I'd rather hear good questions. I'd 
rather have something to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Levy's game plan might be likened to a symphony, Johnson's to gangsta rap. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy tends to respect experience. Johnson prefers speed, which comes in the 
young. His teams are a blur. Two times, they ran down San Francisco's Steve 
Young from behind. Once, they even ran down Ricky Watters from behind. Now, 
that is speed. And sometimes they were defensive linemen, troglodytic in 
appearance but trackable only by radar when the ball is snapped.  
</P>
<P>
 Levy wants to stay at Buffalo forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amos Alonzo Stagg coached till he was 90," he reminds you. "You can stay 
young and coach forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson never heard of Amos Alonzo Stagg. But he admits, "I get a little 
antsy, I get a little bored. I want a new challenge. I felt if I stayed at (the 
University of) Miami, I could have won a couple more national championships. 
But I wanted to take another challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 He may be looking for yet another. He allowed as how he might like the 
challenge of an expansion team at Jacksonville. But owner Jerry Jones reminded 
him he had a 10-year contract with five years left.  
</P>
<P>
 Levy's relationship with his owner, Ralph Wilson, is comfortable, 
non-obtrusive. Johnson and Jerry Jones were perceived by the public as joined 
at the hip, ex-college buddies who played on the same Arkansas team. Jones 
bought the team for Johnson, or so the story went. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion peeves Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like I'm a little different from your clone coach, he's different from 
your clone owner," he says of Jones. "But people have this misconception we 
spend all our time together, an hour or two a day together. But, I'm a 5 
o'clock in the morning guy. I'm also a 10 o'clock in the night guy. That leaves 
about two hours a day we even could get together!" (Laughter.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the owner escapes the Johnson rag. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy takes the position his scouting staff brings him outstanding football 
players. Johnson figures he can evaluate football talent on the hoof as well as 
anyone in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got guys on an hourly wage to look at film," he says. "We don't give 'em 
names, we just give 'em numbers -- so they won't be influenced by preconceived 
notions or reputations. They watch performance, not stars. We don't tell them 
whether it's Charlie Ward or some backup." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson wants you to know he was undone once by reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (Miami) lost the Fiesta Bowl (to Penn State). We ran up 450 yards to their 
150 or 200, but we had a quarterback who had been injured and he didn't have 
enough preparation and he threw three interceptions. But I wouldn't pull him 
because he was a Heisman Trophy winner. We lost." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for Heisman Trophy winners and other underachievers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You make a mistake when you let your heart make the picks," he warns. "I got 
Alonzo Highsmith with my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who think Johnson's heart is easy to overlook, that he does it 
all the time. But Johnson bristles at the notion that the Herschel Walker trade 
to Minnesota for a passel of draft picks "made" the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what you do with the picks that counts," he says. "The Rams got a whole 
mess of them in the (Eric) Dickerson trade. If you pick up a bunch of schmoes, 
it doesn't do you much good." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson hints that he picked up a bunch of all-pros, not all-schmoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, we made probably 40 or 50 (other) trades to build the team," he says 
defensively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys have had two coaches in their history -- the legendary Tom 
Landry and Johnson. Under Landry, they became "America's team." There is some 
question Johnson wants to share the billing. They are Jimmy Johnson's team. 
Does Johnson want to be a legend? 
</P>
<P>
 "Naw, I'm not into that," says the non-legend. "I'm not trying to make a mark 
on history. I'm not into longevity. But I'm a very miserable person if I don't 
achieve what I set out to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Levy probably doesn't want to become a legend, either. He coached at Cal, 
about as far from being a football factory as you can get, west of Harvard. 
Johnson coached at Miami, about as close to being a football factory as you can 
get, football's version of the Dirty Dozen. Levy won eight games in three years 
at Cal. Johnson won 52 games in five years at Miami.  
</P>
<P>
 Levy has lost three Super Bowls. Johnson has never lost any.  
</P>
<P>
 Levy is gracious in defeat. Johnson is not particularly gracious even in 
victory. He has no patience with small talk, which he takes to mean any talk 
not including football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to go to some dinner party and have some lady in a bouffant 
hairdo lean over and ask me what a quarterback is," he grumbles. Talk football 
or shut up.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is not predicting victory Sunday. He probably thinks it's unnecessary. 
When asked if his team might suffer from overconfidence, given the outcome of 
last year's game, he frowned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overconfidence is not a bad thing in football," he said. "As long as it 
doesn't boil over into complacency, where you think you're so good you don't 
need preparation. Underconfidence is worse. " 
</P>
<P>
 Levy, of course, doesn't have to worry about overconfidence.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; USC TAKES ON CAL WITH QUESTIONS AT GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The USC women's basketball team, ranked eighth nationally, will try to improve 
its Pacific 10 Conference record to 8-0 this weekend, playing tonight against 
California and Sunday afternoon against Stanford. Both games will be at USC's 
Lyon Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, 11-3 overall and 4-1 in the Pac-10, plays at 7 tonight at UCLA (8-7, 
3-3). On Sunday, Cal (7-8, 1-4) is at UCLA at noon, and Stanford, ranked 10th, 
is at USC at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (13-1) has won seven in a row since losing to Iowa on a disputed, 
last-second three-point shot Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Leslie figures to become the Pac-10's all-time leading scorer this 
weekend. She needs 28 points to pass Val Whiting, who completed her Stanford 
career last season with 2,077 points.  
</P>
<P>
 USC could be thin at guard tonight. Point guard Nikki McCrimmon's status is 
uncertain, although she is expected to be available for Sunday's game. 
McCrimmon is planning to fly home Friday night from New York, where she has 
been all week with her mother, who is seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Off guard Karleen Shields needed four stitches for a deep cut over an eye that 
she injured Tuesday, when she slammed into a wall at practice but she is 
expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford has had plenty of offense from the perimeter. The Cardinal sank 12 
three-pointers in beating Cal last weekend and is shooting 51% from three-point 
distance over its last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA gained a split on its Arizona trip last weekend. At Arizona, the Bruins 
scored the first nine points of the second half and had a seven-point lead with 
5:30 left but lost, 83-78. UCLA had beaten Arizona State two days earlier, 
84-59. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins' Natalie Williams has had at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in 10 
of her last 15 games.

SUPER BOWL XXVIII DAILY REPORT; LINEMEN RISK HIGHEST PRICE FOR BULKING UP TO 
PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NFL Players Assn. had good news for most players Thursday -- but bad news 
for linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health on 
the mortality rate of NFL players -- the first study of its kind -- revealed 
that their death rate matched that of the general population. 
</P>
<P>
 The study showed that the average football player will live at least 72 years, 
which is also the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a marked difference from the previously held -- but unproven -- belief 
that the average NFL player will be dead by 53. 
</P>
<P>
 NIOSH is a government agency and received no fee from the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to worry anymore about guys hearing that statistic and running 
for the window," said Gene Upshaw, executive director of the union. "It's great 
news indeed that NFL players live as long as anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 The same study, however, showed that linemen have a 52% higher chance of dying 
of heart disease than the average person. They also face triple the risk of 
getting heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 That would seem logical when one considers the average size of an NFL lineman. 
No studies have been done comparing 300-pound linemen to 300-pound persons in 
other walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone considering bulking up to play football should consider the real risk 
of heart disease," said Dr. Sherry Baron, director of the study. 
</P>

 According to the NFLPA, 409 players will become unrestricted free agents on 
Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are players who have total freedom of movement, unless their teams 
designate them as franchise or transition players. 
</P>
<P>
 The top free agent in the Southland is Raider wide receiver Tim Brown. But 
despite his desire to leave, he will have to stay if owner Al Davis names him a 
franchise player, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders could also lose linemen Max Montoya and Don Mosebar and tight end 
Ethan Horton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' top unrestricted free agents are receiver Henry Ellard, tackle 
Jackie Slater and safeties Pat Terrell and Michael Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new free-agency rules last year, the average NFL salary increased 
51%, to $737,850. BILL PLASCHKE

ANALYSIS / THE BILLS' OFFENSE; KELLY DIRECTS FROM A FRONT-ROW SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a good reason the Buffalo Bills have become the only team in the 
game's 28-year history to reach the Super Bowl four times in a row: They have 
the NFL's only on-field play caller, Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 As veteran center Kent Hull said when asked about the January playoff surge 
that has advanced the Bills again, "Jim put us in the right play at the right 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a quarterback can do that consistently. The coaches calling the signals 
for the other teams, standing on the sidelines or sitting upstairs are too far 
removed from the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Their computers are formidable. When an offensive coach shows up at game time 
with his computer script -- which identifies the precise call to make in any 
and all crises -- he knows everything. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows all there is to know -- that is, as of Friday morning, when he prints 
it out. 
</P>
<P>
 At game time, the situation begins to change in the opening minutes, when an 
offensive guard, say, or defensive tackle departs with a little injury; or when 
it becomes clear that a feared opponent isn't quite up to his game, for 
whatever reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly is instantly aware of such changes. He can adjust as soon as the next 
play. A play-calling coach might adjust for the next series. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the matchup in the Georgia Dome on Sunday is man against computer. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't the same as saying that Kelly definitely will win. Play-callers can 
do only so much. And Kelly's opponents, the Dallas Cowboys, are still the NFL's 
best team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 28th Super Bowl, though, the Cowboys will be laboring under three 
disadvantages: 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike last year -- and unlike all previous Super Bowl winners -- their very 
best players are beaten up physically: Quarterback Troy Aikman has a head 
injury, running back Emmitt Smith a shoulder injury, pass rusher Charles Haley 
a back injury and two other Dallas starters can't even suit up. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the psychology of any rematch is always against the team that won last 
time -- and in last year's Super Bowl, Dallas beat Buffalo by five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Cowboys, who were obliged to reach their season's peak last week 
to defeat the San Francisco 49ers, can be expected to cool off a little, or 
maybe a bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Kelly will have a chance to win only if it turns out that his linemen 
can handle Dallas' linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the question of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 For, at 33, on bad knees, Kelly is kind of a statue now. He needs a lot of 
protecting -- and he didn't have it last year. 
</P>
<P>
 If that changes for the better, Kelly can make it close, at least for a while, 
because of the kind of quarterback he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hall of Famer Joe Namath, who is here to toss the coin Sunday: "When you 
call your own plays, an offensive lineman can make you look like a genius when 
he comes back to the huddle and says: 'The guy across from me is getting tired. 
We can run '34 blast' right at him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That is Kelly's edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs Buffalo beat this season to get this far had more rigid standards. 
Their game plans, after passing through the computer, focused on the 
highest-percentage play on any given down. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with making such calls repeatedly is that, in any given situation, 
everyone, including the opposition, knows what the highest-percentage play is. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly prospers, by contrast, as a loner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes nobody, including Kelly, is able to remember precisely why he made 
some of his best calls. 
</P>
<P>
 You can take it for granted that his team wouldn't have been here once, let 
alone four times, if Kelly hadn't seized control of Buffalo's offensive 
communications four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It was midway through the 1990 season that he discovered how to keep the Bills 
out of their plodding, run-dominated offense, which strongly resembled most 
other NFL offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 His secret? A shotgun stance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo coaches had always let him call the plays in the shotgun formation 
-- which was also their fast-break, two-minute offensive formation -- so he 
simply stayed in the shotgun, play after play, game after game. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have total control of the offense, it's a big plus," Kelly said 
again this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's offensive direction helped the Bills through Super Bowl XXV, when they 
lost to the New York Giants only on a missed field goal, 20-19, but they have 
been going downhill in every Super Bowl since. 
</P>
<P>
 In game XXVI, during a battle of one-back teams, the Washington Redskins -- 
introducing a counter play -- could run in both directions. But Buffalo 
couldn't, and Kelly attempted a Super Bowl record 58 passes in a vain attempt 
to forestall a 37-24 setback. 
</P>
<P>
 By game XXVII, the Bills had a counter play, having learned it from the 
Redskins, but they ran into a Dallas power plant that took the ball away nine 
times and scored seven touchdowns, 52-17. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, Kelly might get it all together. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all still on his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like the president of the United States," Hull said. "If the 
economy goes to hell, he's to blame."

SUPER BOWL XXVIII DAILY REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It pays to be an offensive linemen for the Cowboys. Besides the $64,000 each 
player can get for winning two playoff games and the Super Bowl, the Cowboys' 
offensive linemen have already been given: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Airplane tickets to anywhere in the country and custom-made boots by 
quarterback Troy Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Airplane tickets to the destinations of their choice by running back Emmitt 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gold chains by wide receiver Michael Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A case of filet mignon and case of wine by quarterback Bernie Kosar. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Silver meditation balls by quarterback Jason Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Garrett? Meditation balls? 
</P>
<P>
 "Troy can afford the plane tickets better than I can," said Garrett, who 
completed nine of 19 passes for 61 yards this season. "The meditation balls are 
just something I picked up. I've used them through the years. I was in a store 
and the lady said she could mass produce them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are two silver balls about golf-ball size that have a jingle inside them 
when you run them together. They are supposed to relax you through the nerve 
endings in your hand. The pamphlet they come with says they have all kinds of 
positive effects on you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Tasker, the MVP in last year's Pro Bowl, had to convince hotel security 
this week that he was a player with the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started to go in and they stopped me," said Tasker, who is smaller than 
some of the ball boys employed in the league. "I was carrying a camera, which I 
guess is taboo. The security people didn't know me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Hey, I'm a Buffalo Bill.' Once I told them (who he was), they 
apologized. I can't blame them. . . . I guess I don't look like a football 
player. As long as I don't wear my jersey, pads and helmet nobody knows who I 
am. Even if I did have all that stuff on, they'd probably say, 'Hey, is Tasker 
your favorite player?' Or figure I was Tasker's little brother." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only one guarantee this week, from Irvin: 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you something. There is nothing I can say that is going to make 
the Bills play any harder than they already have in their minds that they are 
going to play. When (cornerback) Nate Odomes lays down in his bed the night 
before the Super Bowl, he's thinking, 'I'm going to eat Michael up.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I can sit here and talk about Nate or talk about Nate's family, talk 
about his mother, it's not going to make him play any harder. He's still laying 
down every night saying, 'I'm going to eat Michael up.' I guarantee that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills were thumped in last year's Super Bowl, 52-17, in large part because 
they turned the ball over nine times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would just get off the field, try and take a rest and there would be a 
turnover," Buffalo nose tackle Jeff Wright said. "We got tired; they wore us 
down. With all the turnovers we were fighting two teams: them and ourselves." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pool report on Cowboy practice: It's not exactly a Jimmy Johnson guarantee of 
victory, but close enough. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning last year's Super Bowl, Johnson admitted that he had told 
assistant coaches after Thursday's practice that his team would win Super Bowl 
XXVII. 
</P>
<P>
 Any similar vibes this year? 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good," Johnson said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Charles Haley did not practice for the second day in a row 
because of a sore back. Johnson said Haley will be active for Sunday's game, 
but he is not expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just hoping that one of the guys on the team can inspire me to really go 
out and play hard so I can overcome this thing," Haley said. "My back is really 
hurting right now. It has to calm down a lot before I can go out there and 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pool report on Bill practice: Look for the Cowboys to cry foul if they lose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills took advantage of poor weather, and while the Cowboys remained 
outdoors, they moved indoors to work in the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got in some good quality work, and I was glad to use the site of the 
game," Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said. "The concentration was good, as was the 
execution. I like what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Richard Harvey, who left Wednesday's practice early because of a 
sore knee, participated without problems Thursday. Levy said he was encouraged 
by Harvey's progress. T.J. SIMERS

 As a Raider, Howie Long, who has held down one end of the defensive line for 
13 years, is most heatedly remembered right now in Los Angeles for jumping 
offside. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans have been saying that Long took the Raiders out of the playoffs 
earlier this month with his encroachment penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're wrong about that. So are the NBC announcers who started that talk. 
</P>
<P>
 For that is the way Long plays. Or played. Charging. Aggressive. Intense. 
Always getting after the passer. And that's the way some of us will think of 
him, and describe him, when the kids ask: "What was Howie Long really like?" 
</P>
<P>
 He may have been offside more than any other defensive end of his time. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also disturbed more quarterbacks than perhaps any other defensive end 
who has played in a Los Angeles uniform since Deacon Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 When Long retired Thursday -- choosing for the announcement scene a forum at 
the Super Bowl -- he could look back on a career that included 91 1/2 sacks. 
And who knows how many "hurries." All this while continually being 
double-teamed. 
</P>
<P>
 A former teammate, Hall of Famer Gene Upshaw, who now heads the NFL Players 
Assn., recalled that the thing he appreciated more than anything about his 
football career was not having to play against Long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never known a more intense player," Upshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Al LoCasale, the Raider executive who also knew Long in Oakland, is of the 
opinion that the intensity was the result of a reproof by a Sports Illustrated 
writer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memorable nationally televised performance on the day Long was drafted, 
the writer called him "an eighth- or 10th round-choice" and flayed the Raiders 
for taking him second. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Day 1, Howie was out to prove the (writer) wrong," LoCasale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long's passion to succeed, however, antedates the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to walk 10 miles to school every day -- through the snow," he told the 
reporters at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't look the type. Seeming younger than his 34 years, he stood 
patiently before the Super Bowl writers in expensive double-breasted threads 
and a 1950s crew cut that called to mind a nicely groomed collar-ad salesman of 
40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He was dressed, it could be, for the TV auditioning that will lead him to what 
he hopes will be his next career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be out on the street," he promised. 
</P>
<P>
 If he felt the need to retire three or four years early, he crammed the 
explanation into seven words. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been operated on seven times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last remaining Oakland Raider on the El Segundo roster, Long chose a 
reasonably acceptable moment to retire -- acceptable that is, from the club's 
standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 For the defensive line is a Raider strength. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are no more changes, Coach Art Shell, when he lines them up next 
July, will simply slip Anthony Smith in for Long next to Chester McGlockton, 
Nolan Harrison and Greg Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 1993 weeks went by, Smith played more and more and better and better, 
and not only on passing downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Long hoped to discuss all that on Thursday with Al Davis. He is closer to the 
club owner than any other player. They aren't good friends, exactly, but they 
get along. 
</P>
<P>
 But as intense as Long is, he said he couldn't get through to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 As a media man now, he'll have to get used to that.

DEVELOPERS BUILDING UP MOMENTUM; CONSTRUCTION: IT'S NO '80S-TYPE BOOM, BUT 
SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF NEW HOMES AND RETAIL CENTERS ARE IN THE WORKS ACROSS THE 
COUNTY FOR 1994. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 While still far short of the mid-1980s building rush, 1994 may be the year 
Orange County begins to see substantial new construction, as developers 
cautiously start to build new homes and shopping centers, real estate experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the county, the most money spent on building will still be 
infrastructure-related: new highways and roads. There is little sign of life in 
the market for new office buildings, but portions of the commercial and 
residential building markets are rebounding. For new construction, industry 
experts are looking to the retail and housing sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading housing projects, based on number of homes yet to be built, are 
targeted for first-time home buyers, said Jeff Meyers, chief executive officer 
at the Meyers Group, a real estate consulting company in Newport Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 The largest such project is Summit Park, a 273-unit project in Anaheim Hills 
which has 258 units left to build, Meyers said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the list, seven of the top 10 (projects) are attached 
condominiums priced under $200,000," Meyers said. He predicted anywhere from 25 
to 30 housing projects will begin building in Orange County in 1994. That's in 
addition to the projects already under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 259 subdivisions under construction in Orange County right now and 
there are a lot of new projects opening up in the first quarter," Meyers said. 
"This means there will be quite a lot of new home construction in 1994."  
</P>
<P>
 But, for new office building construction, the county's largest project is the 
$29-million State Compensation Insurance Fund Building, a 210,000-square-foot 
Santa Ana high-rise that is expected to be completed this year, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just hasn't been much office construction in Orange County during the 
past year or so," said Ben Bartolotto, research director for the Construction 
Industry Research Board. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in retail construction there is a mini-boom, with several large 
shopping developments in the works, such as the 1.3-million-square-foot 
Foothill Ranch Towne Centre, with its planned 24-screen movie complex and 
tenants such as HomeBase and Target. There is also a 290,000-square-foot 
shopping center under construction in Mission Viejo, which will have a Borders 
Books and Best Buy Electronics, and the Marketplace at Laguna Niguel, a 
499,000-square-foot project. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these projects are for real, they are happening," said Greg Mickelson, a 
retail broker with Grubb & Ellis Commercial Real Estate. "These are 
sophisticated retailers coming in who continue to be bullish on the future of 
Orange County. They are putting their money where their mouth is." Home

 Home builders expect 1994 to be a year of increased activity in Orange County, 
with new homes under construction from Yorba Linda to Laguna Niguel. Not all 
the developments will be finished this year. These are the largest new home 
projects, based on the number of homes left to build and excluding apartment

UNOCAL PLANS JOB CUTS AT 2 FACILITIES; OIL: WORK FORCE AT BREA LAB AND ANAHEIM 
PLANT WILL BE REDUCED BY AS MUCH AS 7% OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS DUE TO A 
WORLDWIDE SLUMP IN CRUDE PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Struggling to cope with depressed world crude prices, Unocal Corp. said 
Thursday that it would shrink its Orange County work force by as much as 7% 
over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The international petroleum and chemical products giant said that "changing 
market conditions" have forced it to scale down its research and development 
facilities in Brea and Anaheim, a move that will eliminate between 50 and 100 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The job cuts are part of an overall corporate restructuring plan necessitated 
by an ongoing slump in oil prices that is not expected to change soon, said 
spokeswoman Janet McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of this is not to save 'X' amount of dollars this year, but to 
permanently realign the corporation," McClintock said. "We are constantly 
looking at how we do business and accepting change and adapting to it." 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock said that those affected by the impending job cuts are employed at 
two Brea locations where the company's laboratory facilities are located, and 
its Anaheim plant, where it houses a computer system that studies oil 
exploration data. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal has 1,100 workers in Brea and 170 in Anaheim. The company also has 
about 100 additional workers scattered throughout Orange County who will not be 
affected by the layoffs. Computer operators, laboratory technicians and 
administrative personnel will make up the bulk of the job eliminations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those employees study seismic data to determine rock structure and to 
locate possible underground oil reserves, while those in the laboratories study 
chemicals and data related to oil exploration and refining. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock said she did not know how many of the eliminated positions would 
result in layoffs. But she added that beginning next month the company will 
offer some workers new positions elsewhere in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have that kind of information yet," McClintock said. "There are 
still a lot unknowns that we still have not identified." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its restructuring, Unocal will outsource, or contract to outside 
firms, the seismic and laboratory work currently done by its workers in Brea 
and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changing market conditions make outsourcing an attractive economic 
alternative," Charles R. Williamson, head of Unocal's Fred L. Hartley Research 
Center in Brea, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will continue to study geochemistry, chemistry production, 
drilling techniques and seismic technology at the plant, but at a smaller 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal stock closed at $28 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, unchanged 
from Wednesday.

 For those who want to become successful importers or exporters, the Center for 
International Trade Development in Irvine may be the place to start. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the more than 1,000 entrepreneurs and business executives who stopped 
by the center in the past two years had little idea how to get involved in 
global trade, said Ray Thompson, center manager. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center, students were given advice, classroom instruction and heard 
about informal get-togethers with trade experts aimed at turning an idea or 
product into an international moneymaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The center operates under the auspices of Coastline Community College in 
Fountain Valley, and is one of nine such centers around the state. Services 
include export counseling, technical assistance, strategic planning, providing 
trade finance options, resources and referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 The services are free. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Thompson said many clients hear of the center through referrals from 
the U.S. Department of Commerce offices in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will automatically refer you to me and (we'll) help you on how to get 
started," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center can be reached at (714) 863-9356.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: IMPERIAL CREDIT REPORTS HEFTY INCREASES IN REVENUE, 
PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Low interest rates and heavy home refinancing contributed to a 52% increase in 
revenue and a 35% increase in profit for the year, Imperial Credit Industries 
Inc. reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which is the parent of Southern Pacific Thrift & Loan Assn., 
reported annual revenue of $72.3 million, up from $47.5 million for 
1992.Earnings were $18.4 million, or $1.79 a share, compared to a profit of 
$13.6 million, or $1.49 a share, for the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Snavely, chairman and chief executive officer of Imperial, said the 
profit increase resulted from a huge growth in volume. The company reported 
mortgage originations of $6 billion for the year, up from $3.4 billion for 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing factors, Snavely said, were the opening of five wholesale loan 
production offices on the East Coast and in Colorado; the creation of a direct 
access program that licensed 16 brokers to approve mortgages outside of 
California; and the introduction of a new secondary loan program, called Smart 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The total volume of business was up dramatically in all units," Snavely said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also reported fourth-quarter revenue of $21.4 million, compared to 
$14.2 million for the same period a year earlier. Three-month earnings were 
$5.1 million, or 50 cents a share, up from $3.9 million, or 38 cents a share, 
for the same period a ear earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage funding for the fourth quarter was $2.4 billion, Imperial said, an 
increase of 159% over that for the fourth quarter of 1992. ANNE MICHAUD

 Wynn's International Inc.: The automotive-products maker reported a profit of 
$8.9 million for 1993, up 23% from $7.2 million. Revenue for the year of $284.9 
million was down 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynn's profits, equal to $1.62 a share, were boosted by the performance of the 
company's automotive sealing products and automotive chemicals. The 
Orange-based company's auto air-conditioning unit, hit by the recession, posted 
declines in revenue and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, the 55-year-old company reported a $2.2-million 
profit, up from $2 million in the final period of 1992. Revenue of $69.9 
million was up 4%. The per-share basis of the company's earnings, adjusted for 
a 3-for-2 stock split in September, was 37 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 James Carroll, Wynn's president and chief executive, said he expects continued 
improvement in the auto industry and the worldwide economy this year and 
projected annual earnings growth of 10% to 20%.

 Business Goes South: A private investment group in Irvine is positioning 
itself to take advantage of environmental improvements that are sure to come in 
tandem with increased trade with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventana Growth Funds recently signed an a $5-million agreement to build three 
water treatment plants in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The plants are run by Grupo Fypasa, an environmental company based in Mexico 
City that was founded in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding is being handled through Ventana's North American Environmental 
Fund, which has raised more than $30 million of its $50-million goal. The 
investments will go to help with the almost $2 billion that Mexico will need to 
invest in infrastructure.

 Landing Russian Business: In a couple of months, an airport in eastern Russia 
that is operated by an Orange County company will start receiving daily 
stopovers by major trans-Pacific airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, three jet freighters have landed at Elizovo Airport near 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, formerly a top-secret military airport in the former 
Soviet Union.And many more are on the way, promised Dennis Crosby, executive 
vice president of the California Kamchatka Cos. in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting pretty close to that point," he said. "We are working through a 
number of technical issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby and other California Kamchatka executives hope to turn Elizovo Airport 
into a top refueling stop for heavy jet freighters flying between the Far East 
and the West Coast of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 That won't happen, however, until the airport's certification process is 
completed. The first freighter to land, a World Airways DC-10, was required to 
have a Russian navigator aboard. The navigator is now no longer a must, but 
each airline needs to bring along a Federal Aviation Administration official in 
order to have various aircraft types certified at Elizovo. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, a Tower Airways Boeing 747 and an American Trans Air Lockheed L-1011 
have met that requirement. Having done so, models of those planes can land 
without the FAA monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have at least one flight a day starting in February," Crosby 
said. "It will build from there."

80 WORKERS LAID OFF BY WESTERN DIGITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Western Digital Corp. said Thursday it has laid off 80 employees in its 
money-losing microcomputer products division as part of an effort to make the 
division profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The company cut 60 positions at its Irvine headquarters and 20 at a plant in 
Mountain View, said Brenda Bennett, a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts leave Western Digital with 6,600 employees worldwide, including 900 
in Orange County. Bennett said the affected workers will receive severance pay 
and outplacement services. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital reported a profit in its most recent quarter, but its 
microcomputer products division has consistently lost money. The division, 
which designs and sells chips that control a computer's internal functions, 
accounts for 15% of the company's sales.

valued at $1 million, with the Navy's China Lake facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing communications services at China Lake Station, known as the Naval

<P>
 The Navy is renegotiating with Comarco to consolidate the two contracts for 
China Lake and Point Mugu. It has indicated that it would continue to extend 
its China Lake contract, initially scheduled to lapse at the end of January,

 AST Research Inc.: The Irvine-based company said Thursday it has agreed to 
sell the assets of two of its Northern California software units to a 
subsidiary of Ohio-based Telxon Corp. The purchase price was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 AST acquired the PenRight! and FieldNet software units when it purchased Tandy 
Corp.'s computer manufacturing business last year and is now jettisoning them 
because they don't fit with its core computer-hardware business. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sale, the Telxon subsidiary will acquire intellectual property rights, 
inventory and contracts for PenRight! software development tools and FieldNet 
wireless communications software. Telxon is a major developer of wireless 
portable computer communication systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Telxon said it will keep the marketing, support and engineering staffs of the 
two units, both in the Bay Area city of Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the sale give AST the right to continue selling PenRight!, and the 
company said it intends to bundle the software with its "pen-centric" 
computers, which use electronic pens instead of keyboards for data input.

EX-TITAN OFFICIAL DISPUTES TESTIMONY; TRIAL: DITOLLA SAYS ADMINISTRATORS DIDN'T 
WANT TO KEEP HUFFMAN AS COACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Cal State Fullerton athletic official Thursday disputed key 
university testimony in the wrongful-termination trial of former Titan 
volleyball Coach Jim Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve DiTolla, former associate athletic director, testified that Athletic 
Director Bill Shumard said during a Dec. 10, 1991, meeting that "while we have 
concerns, we are going to renew (Huffman's) contract." 
</P>
<P>
 But Shumard, presented Wednesday in Orange County Superior Court with that 
version of events, said: "That's not the truth at all." 
</P>
<P>
 University attorney Kevin Gerry has maintained throughout the 1 1/2-week-old 
trial that the decision to terminate Huffman because of substandard performance 
was made in the fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard testified that when a decision was subsequently made to drop 
volleyball because of financial problems, he felt it would be more "humane" to 
terminate Huffman along with the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt (Huffman) would have a better opportunity to move on to another job 
if the program was dropped and he was dropped along with it," Shumard said. "We 
didn't want to add insult to injury." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's contract expired on Dec. 31, 1991, but he continued working through 
January under an implied contract. Fullerton announced it was discontinuing 
volleyball on Jan. 28, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman and his players filed suit, claiming the move violated state sex 
discrimination laws, and won a preliminary injunction blocking the school's 
move that March. Huffman was fired March 23, 1992, one working day after the 
court order was issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman claims he was terminated not because of substandard performance but 
because he spoke out against the school's poor gender-equity record and 
initiated successful legal proceedings, which resulted in negative publicity to 
administrators and the school. His attorneys must prove retaliation was a 
motive in his firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Along those lines, DiTolla testified Thursday that at a March 20, 1992, 
meeting between him, Jack Bedell, the university's vice president for academic 
affairs, Shumard and associate athletic director Maryalyce Jeremiah, Bedell 
said of Huffman: "We have to get rid of that son of a bitch. He's caused this 
university enough aggravation." 
</P>
<P>
 Bedell testified Thursday that he had "absolutely not" used retaliation in the 
process of terminating Huffman. In an earlier deposition, Bedell said he didn't 
recall making such a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 DiTolla, an athletic administrator through June, 1992, also testified that 
when Shumard informed him of the court order to reinstate volleyball in March, 
1992, the athletic director told him: "But not all was lost. At least we don't 
have to keep Coach Huffman." 
</P>
<P>
 Nan Bullington, administrative services coordinator for the Titan athletic 
department, corroborated DiTolla's testimony about that statement Thursday, but 
Shumard insisted that retaliation wasn't a motive for the termination. 
</P>
<P>
 DiTolla admitted that in the spring of 1992 he signed a declaration, written 
by a university attorney, stating he "didn't know anything about Huffman's 
firing." But he said it was signed under duress. 
</P>
<P>
 DiTolla knew then that his own position would be eliminated, and said he 
wanted Fullerton administrators to give him a good recommendation for another 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared -- I didn't want to upset the apple cart," DiTolla said. "I 
signed that even though I knew it was false." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman, whose teams were 25-80 between 1989-91, has had two expert witnesses 
testify on his behalf. Joyce Pickersgill, a retired Fullerton economics 
professor who is now an economic consultant, said Huffman could suffer economic 
damages between $811,000 and $876,000 if he doesn't get another Division I head 
coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman now works at an Anaheim sports apparel company. He is seeking at least 
$1.2 million in actual and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Lister, a Costa Mesa clinical psychologist, testified Thursday that 
Huffman is suffering from depression and has "lost his identity" since being 
terminated as Titan volleyball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's attorneys will wrap up their case Monday, at which point witnesses 
for the defense will begin testifying.

 The Mission Conference announced a new football alignment -- three divisions 
instead of two -- at a meeting of the conference athletic directors Thursday at 
Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Division -- Fullerton, Golden West, Orange Coast, Rancho Santiago, 
Riverside, Saddleback -- will add Southwestern. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northern Division -- Cerritos, El Camino, Long Beach, Mt. San Antonio, 
Pasadena -- picks up Palomar, the defending national champion, and San Diego 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The move became necessary when Grossmont left the Southern Division to join 
the Foothill Conference, leaving the division with three teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams will play all six opponents in their division and four more against 
teams from the other division. STEVE KRESAL

SECTION VOTES TO MODIFY GIRLS' BASKETBALL RULE; HIGH SCHOOLS: CHANGE, WHICH 
MUST BE APPROVED BY STATE AND NATIONAL BOARDS, WOULD INCLUDE OVER-AND-BACK 
VIOLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a move proponents consider long overdue, girls' basketball took a giant 
step Thursday when the Southern Section Council voted to use the mid-court 
stripe. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal must be approved by the State Federated Council, which meets next 
month, before the National Federated Council can ratify it for the 1994-95 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is seven years in coming," said Dean Crowley, the section's acting 
commissioner, at the Sequoia Athletic Club. "Most of the girls' programs have 
had it for years and years. By bringing in the mid-court line, it's almost the 
same game as the women play at the national level." 
</P>
<P>
 Under modified rules, a violation would be called if the ball is advanced to 
the front court by the offensive team and then returned to the back court, as 
it is in the boys' game, but without the 10-second rule. The girls' 30-second 
shot clock would remain intact, contrary to many programs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Area coaches applauded what they felt was the girls' game coming out of the 
Dark Ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled; we've been waiting for it for years," Woodbridge Coach Eric 
Bangs said. "It's a real healthy rule change. We go to Nevada and play in 
tournaments where teams use it, and we play with it in the summer, then we have 
to take it out for the regular season." 
</P>
<P>
 Bangs said defense-oriented teams will benefit most from the change. "Trapping 
defenses will flourish more," he said. "Teams will be able to use their 
defensive arsenal more." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cypress Coach John Selbe: "Anything that makes the game more like the 
boys' is good. It's a compliment to the girls. In the past, maybe their skills 
weren't as developed. But now, they're talented enough that they can be 
penalized if they don't control the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Bangs believes the 30-second clock is a good idea for boys' and girls' teams, 
but Crowley doesn't expect to see a shot clock for boys in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The National Federation Rules Committee hasn't been in favor of a shot clock 
for boys," Crowley said. "We're not moving in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Thursday, the council turned down a proposal by Art Singer of 
the Southern California Baseball Officials Assn. to implement a 10-run mercy 
rule in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches overwhelmingly opposed it," Crowley said. "They've never been for 
the rule. Without (the 10-run rule), you give kids who may otherwise sit on the 
bench the chance to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also passed a new scoring system for boys' tennis, presented by 
the Ocean League. Doubles teams traditionally have earned one point for a 
victory. Under the new system, which will begin this spring, they will score 1 
1/3 points for a victory and up to 12 points per match, compared to the 
previous nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar boys' tennis Coach Tim Mang proposed the rule change three 
years ago but deferred to Beverly Hills Coach Jason Newman this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got tired of introducing it," Mang said. "We had it passed last year, but 
CIF (in its proposal) included the girls, and we knew the girls wouldn't go for 
it. Luckily, we've got enough good coaches that care about kids. If you've got 
three good (singles) kids, they shouldn't be able to win a match by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great." 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, boys' tennis had a rule that made every doubles set worth 1 1/2 
points, but that was changed eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a compromise," Mang said. "I love it. All the coaches that like 
coaching really like it. It asks you, how are you going to play your lineup? If 
you're playing a close match, you can really have some fun. This makes the 
(traditionally dominant teams) like Santa Barbara and (Palos Verdes) Peninsula 
do something different." 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Approved rally scoring in girls' volleyball for tournament games. This will 
not be employed during regular-season matches, playoffs or State tournament 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Approved an amendment to an article of the CIF constitution that deals with 
discrimination that would change "gender orientation" to "sexual orientation." 
The San Francisco Section requested the term change. 
</P>
<P>
 Both proposals will go the State council in February. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Friends of Golf presented a stipend of $30,000 to the section, to be 
distributed to 75 member schools with golf programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Yard is scheduled to have arthroscopic surgery on his right knee today, 
but even if the injury to his leg is not major, he probably will not be playing 
basketball for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Yard, Cal State Northridge's top rebounder, further jeopardized the final half 
of his senior season by breaking his right hand Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Pete Cassidy said Thursday that Yard slipped on stairs and injured 
himself while trying to break his fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it rains it pours," Cassidy lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 Yard, a 6-6 forward, is averaging 12.3 points and 5.9 rebounds per game.  
</P>
<P>
 He will stay behind when the Matadors leave on a two-game trip today. 
Northridge (3-12) plays Northeastern Illinois in Chicago on Saturday night and

SIMI VALLEY COACH FACES DISCIPLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathryn Scroggin, Simi Valley High principal, has made a recommendation to the 
Simi Valley Unified School District for disciplinary action against basketball 
Coach Dean Bradshaw for his shoving of a player during a game Jan. 14 against 
Westlake, sources said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin on Thursday completed her investigation into the altercation between 
Bradshaw and senior guard Sam Rodriguez during Simi Valley's 51-44 Marmonte 
League home victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw has been suspended from coaching the team, but has retained his 
teaching duties, pending the outcome of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The severity of the recommendation is unclear, but sources indicated the 
matter will be discussed Tuesday at a school board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin did not return phone calls Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 When contacted at home, Pioneer Athletic Director George Ragsdale declined 
comment. Ragsdale, however, did confirm the investigation has been completed 
and that the school board might rule on the situation next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Simi Valley basketball team remains in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers have not played or practiced since the incident. Simi Valley 
takes the court tonight at 7:30 against Camarillo in a league game at the 
Apollo Continuation School in Simi Valley -- but without a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragsdale will sit with the team, but said he will not try to coach. Instead, 
he will leave the play-calling to the team's seniors.

PASS BY VAN BUREN CAUGHT IN COLORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Receiver Leodes Van Buren of Newbury Park High, who represents half of the 
state's all-time leading passing combination, has orally committed to Colorado, 
he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren (6-feet-1, 190 pounds) made his college choice three days after 
Newbury Park quarterback Keith Smith, the state's all-time leading passer and 
Van Buren's best friend, announced he will attend Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could have Keith throwing to me in college, but I think we both made 
good choices," Van Buren said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been great if we could have agreed (on the same school), but 
this is something we each have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, selected all-state by Cal-Hi Sports, tops the state receiving list 
and is No. 2 nationally with 269 receptions for 4,446 yards. He also scored 44 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He received his Scholastic Aptitude Test result in the mail Thursday -- a 
qualifying score in his second crack at the test -- then immediately called 
Colorado to accept a scholarship offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren's score the first time he took the SAT was below 700, the minimum 
required for freshman eligibility at Division I schools. That made Thursday's 
news especially gratifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so pumped up," Van Buren said. "The first time I took (the test), I 
really didn't study . . . I didn't take it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked really hard since then and I studied -- a lot. I did what I had to." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, who said he plans to major in business administration, returned 
from a recruiting trip to Boulder on Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Ventura County lineman of the year the last two seasons, Van Buren 
also took recruiting trips to Fresno State and San Diego State. He declined 
invitations to visit Nebraska, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren helped lead Newbury Park (14-0) to one of the greatest seasons in 
state history, which was capped by a 22-14 victory over Hawthorne in the 
Southern Section Division III championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 He led the state in receiving, catching 101 passes for 1,658 yards and 20 
touchdowns.

SHORTENED SCHEDULE IS CRITICIZED; EARTHQUAKE: SOME COACHES DON'T LIKE DECISION 
TO CANCEL BASKETBALL GAMES IN FOOTHILL LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision appears final, but the debate continues. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is Tuesday's vote by Foothill League principals to cancel one-third 
of the league season for all teams in all sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Jan. 17 earthquake brought extensive damage to one Foothill school 
-- Hart High -- and destroyed vital sections of the freeway system connecting 
the Santa Clarita Valley with the San Fernando Valley, league administrators 
voted, 4-1, to limit games to Saturdays for the next three weeks -- at which 
time the winter season will end. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of playing the scheduled 12 league games, teams will play eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The principals do not want students taking long bus rides in heavy traffic to 
games. But some coaches are saying they will take the long rides and make 
whatever adjustments necessary to salvage the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches want to play," said Burroughs High boys' basketball Coach Art 
Sullivan earlier in the week. "We need to get the thing worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 But the sentiments of Burroughs Principal Tim Buchanan strongly opposed those 
of his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "God bless those kids, they only play 25 games during the summer as well as 
(about 26 games in the regular) season," Buchanan said. "I don't wish to 
diminish the intensity of coaches, but those kids are playing basketball 24 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake has been pretty disruptive, to say the least. People need to 
get a little perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches and administrators agree the sooner everyone returns to normal 
activities the better. But from the coaches' perspective, sports is a normal 
activity -- a physical diversion that can aid in psychological healing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know from practicing with my team this week that being together was 
therapeutic," Canyon basketball Coach Greg Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes and Canyon Athletic Director David Harris fought against the proposal 
the league eventually adopted -- a plan made by the Hart District Athletic 
Council last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes and Harris had several counter proposals -- including a season-ending 
league tournament -- under which most, if not all, of the games could be 
played. 
</P>
<P>
 But the league instead appealed to the Hart committee for a recommendation, 
because its community suffered vastly more earthquake damage than the other 
schools. Principal Laurence Strauss said 10 teachers at Hart have been 
displaced from their homes, including boys' basketball Coach Mike May. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's campus has severe damage. Building inspectors have prohibited entry to 
the auditorium and both gymnasiums. Strauss' office was relocated because the 
administration building is damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Gas was not restored at Hart until Wednesday, when the school opened for the 
first time since the earthquake with a minimum day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have kids who have been displaced, and probably some of the other schools 
could not relate to what we're experiencing," Strauss said. "We've got people 
in our community with no water." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Principal Mike Allmandinger cast the dissenting vote, he said, because 
he supported the philosophy of the coaches. "There is a way to salvage the 
season through a tournament," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said other athletic directors in the league were willing to explore his 
tournament proposal, but the committee which met last Friday never discussed 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hart boys' basketball team -- ranked No. 1 in the area by The Times with 
an 18-1 record -- has practiced regularly at Masters College and College of the 
Canyons. The Indians, like their league counterparts, appear eager to resume 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart assistant Gary Spindt, who has conducted practices in May's absence, 
declared: "We'll play. Any time, any place." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said he will honor the ruling. But if his team can't recoup the the 
games they lost, he will try the next best thing. Canyon will ask their league 
opponents to play practice games.

CSUN CLOSE TO LANDING GERMAN STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge expects formal approval on the enrollment of a volleyball 
player whose presence will greatly enhance the Matadors' chances of returning 
to the NCAA Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Heitmann, a 6-foot-7 middle blocker, said Thursday from Hamburg, 
Germany, that he is awaiting written notification that Northridge has admitted 
him for the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at the school have indicated to Heitmann that university 
administrators have given their verbal approval. However, they have been unable 
to officially record his acceptance because they have been locked out of their 
earthquake-damaged offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann, 24, is a member of the German National Team and was a starter on 
Germany's entrant in the World League, an international circuit of Olympic 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA rules prohibit Northridge Coach John Price from commenting about Heitmann 
until the player is officially enrolled. But from Germany, a former Northridge 
All-American had high praise. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Coffman, who has played with Heitmann on the First Volleyball Club of 
Hamburg, favorably compared the German star with Trevor Schirman, a former UCLA 
All-American and U.S. National Team member. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not as strong as Schirman but he blocks like crazy and he can take over 
a match that way," said Coffman, a starter for the Matadors from 1989-91. "He 
is a very, very good player. He will add a lot to the Northridge program. He 
has so much experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann is the second German to be recruited by Northridge, which must spend 
about the same amount for a foreign student's tuition as it does for an 
in-state student's full scholarship -- tuition, books, room and board. 
</P>
<P>
 Axel Hager, another Hamburg native, was a starter at left-side hitter for the 
Matadors the past two seasons. Hager and Heitmann have known each other 10 
years and are former club volleyball teammates. "Axel enjoyed it very much at 
Northridge," Heitmann said. "He enjoyed volleyball and the whole team." 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann has two years of eligibility. "I will play one year that I know," he 
said. "Maybe longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge last season posted a 23-10 record and advanced to the NCAA 
championship match before losing to UCLA. The Matadors have finished ranked 
among the top four teams in the nation the past three seasons, a string that 
was expected to end at the conclusion of their current campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 With only two starters back, Northridge was unranked in one preseason poll and 
was ninth in another. In their season debut two weeks ago, the Matadors placed 
ninth in the 16-team UC Santa Barbara tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Developments this week should give Northridge's stock a considerable boost. On 
Wednesday, four volleyball players who had been temporarily academically 
disqualified were declared eligible. Now, with Heitmann's addition, the 
Matadors will be considered a strong playoff contender. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't expect any player, no matter how good he is, to jump right in and 
take over," Coffman said. "There will be an adjustment period because the style 
of play is different. But eventually he should be one of the top blockers and 
attackers in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not some glory player who is going to make the outstanding, spectacular 
play. But he's very consistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann's status has been in limbo for weeks while Northridge coaches and 
athletic program administrators scrambled to determine if he was eligible 
according to NCAA rules and their own institutional standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper chase has been made more arduous because the flow of admission 
documents stopped with the Jan. 17 earthquake, which resulted in the closure of 
the Northridge campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann placed transcripts and other documents Northridge requested in the 
mail two days before the earthquake. This week, school officials finally traced 
the package to a mail center at Los Angeles International Airport. The 
information was forwarded to Matador coaches at Occidental College, where the 
team has been practicing. 
</P>
<P>
 When his admission receives written approval, Heitmann will obtain a student 
visa. He could be in Northridge in time for the team's Feb. 4 Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation opener against USC.

TITANS' BASEBALL SUCCESS DEPENDS ON NEW TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the Cal State Fullerton baseball season was so abruptly ended last 
spring with two losses to USC in the NCAA Regionals, the Titans had been ranked 
as high as third nationally, outfielder Dante Powell was swiping bases by the 
dozen and Fullerton alumnus Kevin Costner was attending every Titan NCAA game. 
</P>
<P>
 So here comes 1994, and plenty of questions lie between the Titans and "A 
Perfect World." 
</P>
<P>
 The infield. Is it fixable? 
</P>
<P>
 Two things here. Construction on Titan Field left the infield in a mess. But 
the work is completed, which should help in Tuesday's home opener against UC 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Titan infield, its first test will come in a season-opening 
three-game series at Stanford beginning this afternoon. Freshman Jack Jones 
will attempt to replace Nate Rodriquez (.280) at shortstop and Jeff Ferguson 
has moved from third to second to fill in for Jeremy Carr (.351, 41 stolen 
bases). Jones, from Downey High in Modesto, has impressed the Titans in 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be an outstanding player," associate head coach George Horton 
said. "He's played very well; he's mature beyond his years; he's hit our 
pitching very effectively. He's made the transition very well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's everything we thought he would be in the recruiting process. If he's not 
an outstanding professional, he's certainly going to be an outstanding college 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson (.318 in 1993) has hit well but needs work in the field at second 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 Who will drive the Titans the way Carr did? 
</P>
<P>
 Powell (.335, 42 stolen bases, 12 homers) will replace Carr as the leadoff man 
and Craig Skyberg, the new third baseman, will bat second. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell has been named a preseason All-American and the best outfield prospect 
in the nation by Baseball America. That publication also projects him to be the 
11th player chosen in this June's major league draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened to cupcakes and Twinkies? 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Augie Garrido believes a team prepares for the NCAA playoffs by 
surviving a minefield of a schedule. So the Titans will play Georgia Tech (No. 
1 in Baseball America's preseason poll), Wichita State (No. 3), USC (No. 5), 
Pepperdine (No. 7), Texas (No. 11), Stanford (No. 12) and Long Beach State (No. 
21). 
</P>
<P>
 What do they say? Baseball is 70% pitching? 80%? 90%? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lot, anyway, and Titan arms are strong and experienced. Mike Parisi 
(10-3, 4.71) and Dan Ricabal (11-3, 3.48) return to the rotation and Chad 
Rolish (2-0, 2.74) moves from the bullpen to the rotation. The Titans will go 
with Parisi, Rolish, then Ricabal. That gives them a right, left, right 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the rankings? 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans are third nationally according to College Sports, fifth in 
Collegiate Baseball and sixth in Baseball America. 
</P>
<P>
 Any weaknesses? 
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely still some confusion defensively," Horton said. "That 
just comes from repetition and experience. Those are the mental parts of the 
game, and it takes awhile for new guys to step forward and feel like they can 
take a leadership role."

UMPIRES' PLAN GETS THE THUMB FROM COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal by the California Baseball Officials Assn. to institute the 
so-called "mercy rule" at the high school level was defeated by the Southern 
Section Council on Thursday -- a decision that may have backed umpires into a 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources within the CBOA, umpires met last weekend and voted to 
enforce the rule regardless of what the section council decided.City Section 
games also are included in the CBOA plan. Another CBOA meeting is scheduled 
Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do I put this? Membership will have to decide what to do," said Bud 
Bellinfante, president of the association. "We were advised to expect this 
(outcome)." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bellinfante would not confirm that the organization plans to enforce 
the mercy rule, which stipulates that a game ends when one team is ahead by 10 
or more runs after five innings of play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a meeting, but nothing was established concretely," said Bellinfante, 
who said he plans to meet again with section officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The mercy rule is an attempt by the association to gain a concession from the 
section because umpires have not received a pay increase in three years. Plate 
umpires receive $46 per game and base umpires receive $44. 
</P>
<P>
 A mercy rule is opposed by coaches, who say seven-inning games offer a greater 
opportunity for substitutes to play. Coaches also maintain that if scores get 
out of hand, games could be terminated by mutual consent.

ANGELS SIGN HILLEGAS TO TRIPLE-A CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, who still have a vacancy for a fifth starter, signed right-hander 
Shawn Hillegas to a triple-A contract Thursday and will invite him to spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillegas, 29, who spent five years in the Dodger organization, was 3-6 with a 
6.97 earned-run average in 18 games last season for the Oakland 
Athletics.Hillegas, who will earn $200,000 if he makes the major leagues, has a 
24-38 career record and 4.61 ERA with five teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi also received the latest contract proposal 
Thursday from agent Jeff Moorad in their quest to sign reliever Gregg Olson. 
The Angels are one of six teams who have made competitive offers, Moorad said, 
and a decision likely will be reached by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have offered a one-year, incentive-laden contract that would be 
worth $3.5 million the first year, with rollover options that could turn it 
into a four-year contract. Olson, however, already has a three-year guaranteed 
offer from one club and a one-year, $4-million proposal from another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll find out real soon whether we can get together with Jeff," 
Bavasi said, "or have to jump off." 
</P>
<P>
 The finalists in the Olson sweepstakes are the Baltimore Orioles, Philadelphia 
Phillies, Toronto Blue Jays, Atlanta Braves, New York Yankees and the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, the Angels made an undisclosed cash settlement to the Seattle 
Mariners to resolve a dispute regarding Mike Hartley. The Mariners selected 
Hartley in the Rule 5 draft during the winter meetings only to learn that the 
Angels already had sold him to the Chiba Lotte Marines of the Japanese League. 
The Mariners demanded compensation or the rights to Hartley.

BANDS ROCK THE STATUS QUO FOR YOUNG WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shermayne Brown's eyes brightened and her voice rose as she described the 
moment at an L.A. rock club two years ago that changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
 During a set by the all-women group Addicted, Shermayne watched intently as 
the guitarist blasted forth sound and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the middle of the song she started screaming 'woman power.' It was really, 
really empowering to me," recalled Shermayne, 16 and a junior at Los Angeles 
High School. "I went home that night and I couldn't sleep. I just felt really 
good, really high, like it was a great thing to be a girl." 
</P>
<P>
 With her blue smock dress, pigtails and black-rimmed glasses, Shermayne looks 
more like a storybook schoolgirl than an aspiring rocker, but she is one of 
many young women who have drawn inspiration from a generation of all-women 
bands and solo artists who have stormed the male bastion of rock 'n' roll like 
never before. 
</P>
<P>
 These women say acts such as Liz Phair, L7, Bikini Kill, Hole and 7 Year 
Bitch, through their unabashedly feminist lyrics and no-holds-barred 
musicianship, have motivated them not just to pick up a guitar, but to pursue a 
variety of personal and political interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "To learn anything you have to be encouraged. And to play a guitar or a bass 
or a set of drums and play in a rock band isn't a girl thing," said 16-year-old 
Katie O'Brien, a freshman at Pierce College and a friend of Shermayne. "It's 
supposedly a teen-age guy, Beavis and Butt-head-type thing, where you've got 
the boys doing air guitar, doing fake drums and screaming, and the girls are 
supposed to be groupies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have women who are finally coming out saying, 'We're just as good as 
they are. . . . In fact, we can play better than most of them because we have 
had to work so much harder.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some young women say these groups inspire them to excel in other fields, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love playing that music when I go out snowboarding or when I'm skating," 
said Cara-Beth Burnside, 25, a professional snowboarder and competitive ramp 
skater, and a devoted fan of the L.A. band L7. "It makes me really hyper. 
'Cause when you go out in these sports, you want to be like, really crazy. (The 
music) gets your adrenaline pumping." 
</P>
<P>
 She also identifies with the struggles these groups have faced to get respect 
for their work. Although she said most male rivals welcome her at competitions, 
in her early days she felt intense pressure to prove she could hold her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of that way for women in hard-core sports like snowboarding, where 
it's really more male-dominated. It's harder for women to get recognition and 
to get out there," Burnside said. "They say that about their music. How it's 
hard to get taken seriously as a woman. To get recognition you have to be 
really out there, just busting out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While rock has long been a lifeline out of the frustrations of youth, there 
are specific problems young women face -- from negative body image to sexual 
assault -- that male rock anthems ignore or even glorify. But many women 
rockers use their music to turn that around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of the time when you think of a woman in a band, you think of 
something very pretty and dainty. And not all women are pretty or dainty," 
Katie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Barbie syndrome. You grow up looking at rock stars and Barbies, who 
are so perfect, they've had everything on them tucked and sucked, and increased 
or decreased. And I think a lot of the thing with the girl bands is that they 
aren't all sex objects. They don't wear tons of makeup. They're done as 'We're 
here, this is our music, we've got lyrics.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "We're normal people and we're real women," Shermayne added. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the darkest side of womanhood is brought to light in this music. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Patino, singer of the L.A. band Holy Water, said songs about sexual 
violence lift the shadowy stigma from the experience: "It brings it out in the 
open and says 'It's OK, we're all here together, no one's going to do it 
anymore.' It's a barrier." 
</P>
<P>
 Patino and other musicians organize and play concerts to benefit causes from 
abortion rights to Bosnian rape victims, street kids to voter registration. 
Following the groups' examples, many of their young fans become involved as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend and I were listening to Tori Amos, and one song she sings is about 
rape," said Christie Mosebar, 22, as she distributed literature for Rock the 
Vote at a December benefit at the Palace in Hollywood. "It got (us) interested 
in voting and seeing if we could change something." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some musicians who have already made it believe that it is their 
responsibility to pave the way for younger women. Chicago newcomer Liz Phair, 
who wowed critics with her debut album "Exile in Guyville," a razor-sharp, 
distinctly feminist response to the Rolling Stones' classic "Exile on Main 
Street," said that's part of why she ventured into music in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be taking it on professionally except to open doors for the 
14-year-old girl who wants to play," Phair said. "Even if they come along and 
say, 'Who's this Liz Phair? . . . I can do better than that,' at least I was 
there to be torn down. The more women like me there are doing it, the more that 
14-year-old girl won't even question whether she can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Cummings, music critic for L.A. Weekly, said the time was right for women 
artists to take the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons you have a proliferation of female musicians right now is 
that rock is really desperate for new ideas," Cummings said. "So the field is 
really open to anyone with something new to say. . . . It's just sort of 
reached a critical mass, and Riot Grrrl has encouraged very young girls in 
their teens to start bands." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Riot Grrrl movement, which has gained a following among teen-age girls in 
the past few years, centers around alternative music, soul-baring meetings and 
youthful, in-your-face feminism. Although a barrage of media attention cast an 
unflattering spotlight on the movement and sent some "grrrls" underground, 
others, like Shermayne and Katie, are up front about their participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Riot Grrrl is about girl support and girl love and girls getting together and 
helping each other, especially with sexism, and not competing," Shermayne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riot Grrrls' rallying cries are songs that link bone-crunching guitar riffs, 
howling vocals and lyrics that protest everything from sexism to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie's grandmother, Donna Wilson, with whom Katie lives, said that although 
the music is too loud to suit her taste, its influence on her granddaughter is 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must say I don't understand or like all of this music Katie listens to, but 
I'm quite impressed with some of it," Wilson said. "It's almost more of a 
commentary. Almost more like the '60s. . . . I don't know all the female 
groups, but I think it's great if girls think they can do anything too and not 
just wait for men to come along." 
</P>
<P>
 lthough fans are enthusiastic about the influence of women bands, some of the 
groups themselves resent references to gender in relation to their music. 
</P>
<P>
 "L7 doesn't do stories about women in rock," Sharon Liveten, director of 
publicity for Slash Records, said in response to an interview request. "It 
ghettoizes them. It trivializes their music." 
</P>
<P>
 Exene Cervenka, singer of the veteran L.A. band X, said that while female 
groups can help spur progress for women's rights, they can also turn into a 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overthrowing the patriarchal system is great, and if that is accomplished by 
a woman in a band that's fine," she said. "But sometimes it's marginalized, 
sometimes it's turned into a novelty and sometimes it's ignored. And sometimes 
people are going into it not for reasons of changing things or reaching other 
women, but just because they want to be cool or whatever, the same way guys 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 But to many fans, the groups are nothing short of inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best feeling ever is when you do something that everyone says you can't 
do," Katie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the type of thing that doesn't matter if you're a girl or a guy, but I 
think the reason why we look up to the girl bands is because everyone says, 
'Well they can't do that, that's not a girl thing to do.' But when you see 
someone that's a girl up there you think, that's part of me. I could be doing 
that."

FURNITURE MAY GET SACKED, TOO; BEHAVIOR: ARMCHAIR QUARTERBACKS SOMETIMES ABUSE 
TABLES AND SOFAS IN THE HEAT OF SUPER BOWL BATTLES. BUT MOST WON'T ADMIT TO 
WRECKING A ROCKER OVER A TEAM'S LOSS. 
</P>

<P>
 Ready for your Super Bowl XXVIII party? Have you stocked up on chips 'n' dip 
and the sheet-metal slipcovers? Better pick up some cast-iron shin guards for 
the table legs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If your furniture survived the earthquake, it might need some extra protection 
on Sunday, when armchair quarterbacks take sides in the rematch of the Cowboys 
and the Bills. Beasts in Barcaloungers have been known to destroy chairs, 
tables, sofas and television stands on game day. 
</P>
<P>
 Football-related furniture abuse is one of America's dark little secrets. No 
one talks about it much. Very few are willing to admit it happens. But 
furniture-repair specialists recognize a football-related injury when they see 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holidays are tough on furniture, but nothing compares to the abuse furniture 
takes on Super Bowl Sunday," says Bruce Johnson in his book, "The Wood 
Refinisher" (Ballantine). 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says close games and disputed calls can be a death sentence: "In a 
single moment all across the country, rungs snap, arms come loose, rockers 
break in half -- and refinishers smile, for they know the next day most of 
those broken chairs are going to be sitting in the their shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Even throw pillows can be a menace. An antique lamp found its way to Johnson's 
Durham, N.C., shop after a distraught fan threw a pillow at the TV set and 
beaned the lamp instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks at Dr. Furniture, with 10 Los Angeles-area locations, have recently 
repaired three items owned by men who confessed to inflicting damage during 
football games, spokesman Burt Noriega says. 
</P>
<P>
 The first call came from a sore loser who slammed the top of the coffee table 
with his hand. The force sheared off the table's legs. 
</P>
<P>
 The second victim was an upholstered sofa. While eating during a game, a fan 
became so distraught that he repeatedly stabbed the sofa arm with his table 
knife.  
</P>
<P>
 The third incident involved a TV stand that buckled when it was kicked 
sometime between the two-minute warning and the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the confessions of admitted abusers. Other offenders plead temporary 
insanity and try to pass off the injuries as household accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 For the customer to come clean "really depends on how stupid the act was," 
says Maaka Nua, a technician for Dr. Furniture. "Often, if they don't tell us 
what happened, their spouses will."  
</P>
<P>
 People (let's just call them men) are loath to admit they creamed the 
television cabinet because their team lost a playoff game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this business almost 30 years, and nobody will admit that they 
took out football frustrations on a table," says Walter Butkus, owner of the 
Hawaiian Gardens-based Butkus Furniture Refinishing.  
</P>
<P>
 But customers readily confess when physical enthusiasm breaks the bed. "They 
seem proud of that," Butkus says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the high-risk season for furniture ends with Sunday's game. 
"Emotions run high," Nua says. "(People) get carried away and somebody will 
kick something. The adrenaline flow behind the kick causes the furniture to 
break. It happens in the heat of the moment."

SKIRTING TRADITION; BODY-CONSCIOUS BRIDES CAN WED SOMETHING OLD AND SOMETHING 
NEW IN GOWNS THAT CHANGE SILHOUETTES FROM THE CEREMONY FORMAL TO THE 
SHORT-AND-SWEET PARTY DRESS OR SHAPELY SHEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Brides once had to make a lasting commitment to either a traditional wedding 
gown that covered them from head to toe or a more revealing dress that was fun 
to dance in but shocked the minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Now brides can have their wedding cake and eat it too. They're finding 
wearable bridal gowns that can change silhouettes during the course of the big 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 They can play the part of the blushing bride in a long skirt and train at the 
ceremony, but at the reception, they can ditch the train or whip off the 
over-skirt and be transformed into a party girl in a slitted sheath or a mini. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these convertible gowns feature long sheaths with trains that detach 
for making the rounds at the reception. Other dresses are even more innovative: 
A long, full skirt can be peeled away to reveal a short lace mini-dress or a 
plain sheath. 
</P>
<P>
 Gowns that change shape -- and a bride's attitude -- are a growing part of the 
bridal market, according to Barbara Tober, editor-in-chief of Bride's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what designers are doing. There are all sorts of variations -- lace 
sheaths with tulle skirts, cocktail-length dresses with detachable trains. One 
dress comes with a coat and matching pants," she says. "Second(-time) brides 
want gowns that have another life." 
</P>
<P>
 Body-conscious brides prefer mini-dresses or long sheaths that come with 
detachable trains and over-skirts, according to Laurel Mungo, buyer for Mon 
Amie in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "These girls work hard at having nice bodies, and they want to show them off," 
she says. The minis "are a little more updated and sophisticated. They're for 
the bride who's going to do serious partying at the reception. She can move 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually a bride takes off the skirt just before or after the first dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Mon Amie's convertible gowns come in everything from a strapless to a 
high-neck silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
 "They range from gowns with a detachable train in back so you can see the mini 
as you walk down the aisle to short dresses with long skirts that wrap all the 
way around so you can't tell it's a short dress underneath," Mungo says. 
</P>
<P>
 One sleeveless sheath by Amsale comes in silk-faced satin with a sheer neck of 
chiffon and a satin train that attaches to the dress in back under a row of 
satin roses ($1,815).  
</P>
<P>
 Another indulgence is the sleeveless satin mini covered with lace and 
rhinestones with satin bows on the shoulders and a full wrap tulle skirt with a 
bow in front from the Diamond Collection ($2,465). Budget-conscious brides can 
choose an off-the-shoulder satin mini with lace detailing and a detachable full 
tulle skirt from Forever Yours ($498).  
</P>
<P>
 Without the bulky train, some gowns can even be worn again to other occasions 
-- an idea that sounds novel but is actually an old tradition. Before the 20th 
Century, brides wore their gowns during their first year of marriage to parties 
and operas. After World War II, when inexpensive synthetic fabrics became 
available, brides could afford to buy a one-time gown that was expected to be 
handed down to their daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if a gown looks anything like a wedding dress, the bride has limited 
choices of where she can wear it, says Carolynn Young, co-owner of The Bride in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have to be worn as a ball gown. You wouldn't wear it to a dinner 
party," Young says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brides favor more formal long sheaths that look like traditional gowns 
when worn with their detachable trains. Among the designers pioneering the 
look, Norma LeNain of Los Angeles makes intricately beaded sheaths ($3,500 to 
$7,000), Young says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The detachable trains are convenient," she says. "When you get into the 
heavily beaded dresses, it's a lot of weight to carry around." Her favorite 
gowns, however, come with trains attached. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one day in your life when you can wear a train. You don't want to 
look like you're just going to a ball," she said. "There's nothing more 
beautiful than a girl dressed in a long gown with a long train."

A MAN AND HIS PLANET; HE SURFS, CLIMBS ROCKS, PADDLES A KAYAK AND RUNS A 
COMPANY THAT CATERS TO 'DIRT BAGS.' BUT PATAGONIA FOUNDER YVON CHOUINARD HAS 
MADE SAVING THE EARTH HIS REAL PASSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT WARSHAW, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yvon Chouinard walks the floors of his company headquarters dressed in jeans, 
a button-down shirt and tennis shoes. No aura of power. No hovering assistants. 
No outward sign whatsoever that the founder and owner of Patagonia is something 
of a guru to sports enthusiasts, green capitalists and environmental activists. 
</P>
<P>
 The reverence was hard-won. Chouinard made seemingly impossible climbs up and 
over rocks, mountains and glaciers. He built a very successful clothing 
business from scratch. He gave away money to environmental groups -- and still 
does. Yet, and perhaps most important in the eyes of his admirers, he seems 
like a regular guy. 
</P>
<P>
 On this sunny morning, a light breeze moves off the Pacific. A dozen 
preschoolers laugh as they race around the company's on-site day-care 
playground. And a new surfboard is stashed near the front door, on the slim 
chance a weak northwest swell will pick up in the afternoon. But Chouinard 
isn't feeling very good about himself -- or the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want the truth?" he asks matter of factly. "It's hopeless. It's 
completely hopeless. Civilization is out of control, growing way beyond its 
resources, and it will destroy itself. Anyone who really thinks we're in 
charge, that we can honestly change the course we're on -- well, they're 
mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
 The doomsday scenario plays frequently in Chouinard's mind these days. He is a 
man obsessed -- not with making and selling more of Patagonia's warm and fuzzy 
outdoor wear, but with using his position as a podium from which he might 
persuade corporate America to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can sit down one on one with the president of any company, any time, 
anywhere, and convince them that growth is evil," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chouinard, 55, grew up in a time -- 1950s Burbank -- when growth was 
considered a good thing. The son of a French-Canadian plumber and a homemaker, 
he was a somewhat reclusive kid who took to climbing the Tehachapi Mountains in 
his early teens. After checking out a book on blacksmithing from the local 
library, he also began making and selling climbing gear. 
</P>
<P>
 In the emptier days after high school graduation, Chouinard would often surf 
one of his favorite breaks along Highway 1 -- from Rincon to Killer Dana -- in 
the morning, hammer out a few pitons in the afternoon, then scrounge for soda 
bottles to redeem for gas money. Surfing has always been Chouinard's favorite 
sport, he says, "because you can't cheat at it." 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-'60s, though, Chouinard had become a rising star in the 
then-obscure sport of rock climbing. He and three friends were the first to 
scale El Capitan's North American Wall, in Yosemite National Park. On a later 
expedition in Tibet, an avalanche trapped his group, shoving them 1,500 feet 
downhill. One friend was killed. Another broke his back. In the aftermath, 
Chouinard became a Buddhist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I died on the way down the mountain," he says. "But I came back. And now I 
have absolutely no fear of death . . . when it comes time for me to eat it, 
I'll go." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with only a weathered face to hint at his age, Chouinard is arguably 
one of the world's preeminent outdoorsman: a kayaker, fisherman, skier, surfer 
and climber. Of team sports, he says: "I love Super Bowl Sunday because I can 
surf Rincon without the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few months, Chouinard has traveled to Japan and Christmas Island, 
and he spends many weeks each year with his wife and two children at his second 
home in Moose, Wyo., between the Tetons and the Snake River. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder he's a mentor to people whose work simulates play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He defined this kind of 'Fun Hog' mentality, which meant he was really into 
all kinds of non-motorized outdoor sports and did it with a certain 
environmental consciousness. He puts himself in the middle of these really 
heavy situations, then pulls it off without leaving anything behind," says 
Steve Casimiro, editor of Powder magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What some view as tremendous sporting achievements, Chouinard shrugs off as 
restlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of an 80% guy. I get really into something for a while, then when it 
comes down to where you have to get really weird, really anal, about getting to 
the last stage -- that's when I back off. I think it's bad to go that last bit. 
You become a bore." 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years of making hardware for hard-core climbers in a rented 
corrugated tin shed behind the Hobson Meat Packing plant in Ventura, Chouinard 
and a partner started Patagonia in 1974. The shed is still there, virtually 
unchanged. The plant has been converted into Patagonia headquarters, which, 
like its founder, seems to straddle two worlds. The entrance faces downtown 
Ventura and, beyond, the creeping sprawl of Los Angeles County. Behind the 
building lie the quiet, undeveloped hills of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Patagonia's original line of mountain-inspired clothing was designed to be 
limited, functional, high-quality and expensive, for the genuine outdoorsman 
(or "dirt bag," in company parlance). The business grew slowly and comfortably 
in the late '70s, then exploded in the '80s. In 1992, sales reached $112 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the company has 15 direct retail outlets and about 1,200 dealers 
worldwide. Its 112-page fall/winter mail-order catalogue features everything 
from long underwear to one-piece mountaineering suits -- displayed amid 
evocative pictures of the great outdoors. A kind of tree-hugger's Playboy, 
printed, of course, on recycled paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Chouinard has often watched Patagonia's development from a distance, spending 
six to eight months a year field-testing in the world's highest mountains, 
fastest rivers and best surf. He calls this time away from the office work. 
"It's research, it's studying lifestyles. . . . I'm the outside man. I can't do 
my job sitting at a desk." 
</P>
<P>
 Patagonia began to take an environmental stand while in its infancy, providing 
a little money, a work station and encouragement to a young activist bent on 
protecting the Ventura River. In 1985, the company began pledging 10% of the 
its pretax profits (changed in 1992 to 1% of total sales) to environmental 
groups. Most of the largess is parceled out in relatively small amounts ($1,000 
to $20,000) to grass-roots organizations, because they "can take $1,000 and 
make it seem like $1 million," says Libby Ellis, director of the company's cash 
grants program. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the donations have been controversial. The eco-gangbangers Earth 
First! -- protectors of old-growth redwoods -- received $10,000 in 1989 and 
cost the company sales in the Northwest. Ongoing support for Planned Parenthood 
(the logic being that environmental healing begins with population control) 
landed it on the Christian Action Council's boycott list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patagonia supports the whole spectrum of environmental groups, from moderate 
to radical," says recipient Paul Watson, founder of the Sea Shepherd 
Conservation Society, which targets illegal whaling vessels and poachers around 
the world. "Yvon Chouinard is a businessman who hasn't lost touch with the 
spirit of the '60s, and he's putting back more than he's taking out, which is 
very, very rare these days." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although cynics point out that the $3.6 million in Patagonia handouts over the 
past seven years has paid off in a lot of free publicity -- in the form of 
mostly fawning newspaper and magazine articles -- it has also cleaned up 
beaches and protected habitats, with a minimum of hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sitting here writing a grant proposal to the Environmental Protection 
Agency, which is a very cumbersome process," says Tom Murdoch, executive 
director of the Adopt-a-Stream Foundation in Washington state. "Patagonia just 
asked for a single-page letter. They wanted to know what we were doing and how 
much we needed. That's it. Check was in the mail." 
</P>
<P>
 Patagonia has also been praised for an employee benefits package that is among 
the most progressive in the country, featuring an on-site day-care center, flex 
time and a pro bono program whereby employees work for up to a month for a 
nonprofit group at full pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the '70s, '80s and early '90s, Chouinard and company seemed at once 
shrewd and organic, achieving a special elan in corporate America. But in 1991, 
with the recession beating down, the company stalled. Inventory was dumped into 
the market at below cost, and 120 employees, 20% of its work force, were laid 
off. One-third of the clothing line was cut. Sales went flat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lost in Patagonia," an August, 1992, Inc. magazine article, alternately 
depicted Chouinard as distant and meddlesome, demanding and out-of-touch, 
insular and egocentric. It looked upon Patagonia's New Age-dappled operation 
with a barely disguised smirk: "A company tour leads from the expansive 
day-care facility to the subsidized cafeteria, where employees, fresh from a 
noontime game of volleyball, load up on gourmet pizza, salad and yogurt." The 
article concluded: "Yvon Chouinard touts his company as a model for the future, 
when, in fact, its time may already have passed." 
</P>
<P>
 Chouinard claims 1993 was a boom year and, just for a moment, he sounds like a 
CEO from the Carnegie school: "This is the healthiest company in the industry 
right now. Look, I'm doing things my way, and making more money today than I've 
ever made before." 
</P>
<P>
 But the struggles of 1991-'92 seem to have pushed Chouinard further out on the 
corporate fringe. Patagonia's year-old, in-house Environmental Assessment 
Project, for example, aims to catalogue the company's impact on the 
environment, as well as that of its contractors and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not enough to make money and give it away," Kris McDivitt, chief 
executive of Patagonia, recently told Footprints magazine. "It's now time to 
change the very thing you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, the company last year introduced PCR Synchilla, a fabric made 
from 80% recycled plastic, in many of its garments. "People really respond to 
that," says Brad Gantt, a salesman at Adventure 16 in West Los Angeles. "To 
have a kind of physical manifestation, a jacket or something where people can 
hold it in their hands -- that's recycling right in your face." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's biggest change for the '90s, though, is its "no-growth" policy. 
"It's absurd to think the economy can grow forever; it's absurd and it's 
arrogant. But that's part of the fabric of this country," Chouinard says. 
</P>
<P>
 His master plan is to sell Patagonia's no-growth policy directly to consumers, 
who will force other companies to change the way they do business. "I have to 
show corporations that they can make more money being responsible and 
efficient," he says. Although some observers suggest that Chouinard is merely 
taking a recession-born lemon and making environmentally sound lemonade, he 
can't seem to get the Earth's problems off his conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago, I was driving myself crazy with all of this. There are no 
final victories. They want to dam up your favorite river, you fight it and win, 
but you never stop the dam completely. You stall 'em, and they're back at you 
in five or 10 years. And I really like to see things done. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "So I used to look over all the (petitions for funds) we'd get, and see all 
the giant problems these little organizations were taking on, and I was getting 
depressed. I was bumming out my wife. I'd start talking about this or that 
project and my kids would leave the room. I'd get in the car and go surfing and 
think, 'Oh, Christ, here I am, by myself, driving around, burning all this 
fuel.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then Chouinard came to the realization that even if the world is doomed, he 
may have pushed back the final reckoning -- at least a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not finished, but I'm doing enough," he says. "And because of that, it's 
a lot easier to say, 'Screw it, I'm going surfing.' " Yvon Chouinard, on Work 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the outside man. I can't do my job sitting at a desk." 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I'm doing things my way, and making more money today than I've ever 
made before." 
</P>
<P>
 . . . on Play 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Super Bowl Sunday because I can surf Rincon without the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of an 80% guy. I get really into something for a while, then when it 
comes down to where you have to get really weird . . . about getting to the 
last stage -- that's when I back off." 
</P>
<P>
 . . . on the Environment 
</P>
<P>
 "Civilization is out of control, growing way beyond its resources, and it will 
destroy itself." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no final victories. They want to dam up your favorite river, you 
fight it and win, but you never stop the dam completely. You stall 'em."

THIN IS IN; MENSWEAR FOR FALL MEANS SKINNY TIES, PANTS, JACKETS. OH, AND 
MOHAIR. AND DICKEYS. REALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The shape of things to come? For fall, it's narrow, as New York menswear 
designers serve up male waifs with suede-head haircuts in lean jackets, skinny 
pants and narrow ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, but there was more to this week's fashion shows. Military surplus styling. 
Space-age silver. Side-striped trousers. V-necked sweaters. Long-john leggings. 
Lean, long coats. Fuzzy mohair. And, the triumphant return of the dickey. 
Honest. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the skinny. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bartlett: When this fast-rising designer took a curtain call after his 
"Depression Modern" show Monday, some were calling him the future of American 
menswear. Could be. Big droopy "L'il Rascal" sweaters; elongated "salvation" 
coats in splotchy, Rorschach-like patterns; black apron-tie-wrapped waistcoats 
over bibbed shirts and side-striped trousers, and velvet jeans the color of 
vintage denim. These are cutting-edge clothes that never look silly. He even 
made the dickey look great -- chunky, ribbed and worn over the shirt instead of 
under. Really. 
</P>
<P>
 DKNY/Donna Karan New York: Just back from Florence -- where she was the first 
American designer to show at the influential Italian trade show Pitti Imagine 
Uomo -- Karan put on a slick and exciting presentation with plenty of cool 
clothes to back up all the multimedia theatrics. Lean suits with slim jackets, 
skinny trousers, tab-collared shirts and narrow neckties were the newest wave 
in the DKNY line. Smashing too were silver down jackets and fireman coats, 
rubber-coated jeans and military-style jackets, and side-striped leggings. Best 
from her signature collection were suits with nearly ankle-length jackets, 
rubber-front jersey knits worn as tight as a second skin, and platinum-colored 
robe coats, cabled turtlenecks and sweat pants -- all in Karan's favorite 
cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Klein: V-neck sweaters; texture-rific three-piece suits; flat-front 
pants; fuzzy-side-out reversed shearlings; long, slim "cigarette" coats, and 
nary a gimmick as Klein embraced "the enigmatic period of time when Paul Bowles 
and Jean Cocteau created their most powerful work." The best suits in this 
tasteful, luxurious collection were three- or four-button models in earth-tone 
ribbed crepe, gray crepe ottoman or ash-brown striped wool. Cashmere 
three-button sport coats were plush-toy soft. Tunic-style sweaters -- a trendy 
V-neck preferably -- often replaced shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Hilfiger: Hilfiger embraced several of the season's key trends -- most 
notably the slim silhouette and military surplus styling. To pleasant effect, 
he turned out slim plaid pants, velvet and velvet-trimmed jackets (some 
three-quarter length), cargo-pocket fatigues, and navy peacoats with gray 
blanket stripes at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry Ellis: Now designed by Richard Haines, the America and Collection lines 
scored points with military style, back-belted overcoats topping ribbed 
sweaters and cargo pants, and leather peacoats worn with ribbed sweaters and 
jeans.  
</P>
<P>
 Jhane Barnes: Barnes' appeal is lost on me, but who can argue with success? 
Her best looks were oversized cardigans called "frock smocks," worn over 
hand-painted waffle-weave long johns; a gray and oatmeal "baby boucle" sweater 
jacket worn with sage wool pants, and three- or four-button moire-weave suits 
with drapey pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Boing!: Ari Fruchter and Joe Soto called their latest Boing! show "The Return 
of Genghis Khan," but there were a few dashes of Chaka Khan in there, too. 
Their mohair Henley top -- one of the season's most winning and offbeat ideas 
-- hit the mohair trend in a rugged, inspired way. Other appealing looks 
included brown boucle mock turtlenecks, wide gray judo pants and faux Persian 
lamb-trimmed "Khan" jackets (three-quarter length, drawstring waist). 
</P>
<P>
 J.O.E./Joseph Abboud: Brown hooded cable sweaters, side-laced black-leather 
pullover vests, and band-collared jackets from the J.O.E. line were nice 
enough. Rust-colored cropped shearling jackets, slim Chesterfield coats, 
paisley vests under plaid jackets, and black Donegal double-breasted suits 
highlighted Abboud's signature collection. But the formal-wear finale of men in 
brocade vests, no shirts and velvet pants (which looked more like night clothes 
than evening trousers) went right past tired into nightmare territory.

<P>
 It's nothing like the earthquake, in which two mountain ranges tried to meet. 
But there is a definite groundswell in the fashion world as two dress styles 
try to merge. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ongoing quest for comfort, people have come up with something new. And 
designers have lifted it from city streets onto their runways. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, social doyens could be wearing sports bras under their Chanel suits. 
Business executives might slip golf skirts under double-breasted blazers. The 
idea is to squeeze as much athletic sportswear as possible into an everyday 
wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 The spring collections in Paris and New York were crowded with clothes made 
for gymnasts, skiers and Rollerbladers. Mixed with traditional skirts, suits 
and jackets, they could fit in anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic isn't the first look that comes to mind when you think of Chanel or 
Ralph Lauren. But as fashion evolves toward more relaxed ways, ready-to-wear 
designers, like everyone else, are looking at active wear with new eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like what happened to white T-shirts," recalls Anna Sui, one of 
New York's newer, trend-setting names. "They used to be considered men's 
underwear, then suddenly they became incorporated into everybody's daily 
wardrobe."  
</P>
<P>
 Sui featured silver sweat pants and track-suit jackets as evening wear in her 
latest show. The line will arrive next month at her Los Angeles shop. She 
suggests pairing the sweat pants with a white jacket as a dinner option. 
"Sports and sports activities are such a part of our lives now," she reasons. 
"We're spoiled by the comfort of those clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Designers may be showing their versions of active wear, but most people will 
probably buy the real thing. "People want what is authentic," says Mary 
McGoldrick, director of design for textiles at Adidas. "The real thing is the 
right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, she re-created the classic Adidas track suit from the early '70s, 
in sport colors with a white triple stripe down the sides. McGoldrick updated 
it by tapering the shape for a more fitted look. It has made the pages of every 
major fashion magazine as a must-have item for the new crossover look -- a 
track suit and a white Oxford-cloth shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding one new thing to an aging wardrobe will always give it a spin. This 
spring, check the sporting-goods store while you're at it.MARY ROURKE

FURNITURE MAY GET SACKED DURING GAME; BEHAVIOR: ARMCHAIR QUARTERBACKS SOMETIMES 
ABUSE TABLES AND SOFAS IN THE HEAT OF SUPER BOWL BATTLES. BUT MOST WON'T ADMIT 
TO WRECKING A ROCKER OVER A TEAM'S LOSS.

 Ready for your Super Bowl XXVIII party? Have you stocked up on chips 'n' dip 
and the sheet-metal slipcovers? Better pick up some cast-iron shin guards for 
the table legs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If your furniture survived the earthquake, it might need some extra protection 
on Sunday, when armchair quarterbacks take sides in the rematch of the Cowboys 
and the Bills. Beasts in Barcaloungers have been known to destroy chairs, 
tables, sofas and television stands on game day. 
</P>
<P>
 Football-related furniture abuse is one of America's dark little secrets. No 
one talks about it much. Very few are willing to admit it happens. But 
furniture-repair specialists recognize a football-related injury when they see 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holidays are tough on furniture, but nothing compares to the abuse furniture 
takes on Super Bowl Sunday," says Bruce Johnson in his book, "The Wood 
Refinisher" (Ballantine). 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says close games and disputed calls can be a death sentence: "In a 
single moment all across the country, rungs snap, arms come loose, rockers 
break in half -- and refinishers smile, for they know the next day most of 
those broken chairs are going to be sitting in the their shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Even throw pillows can be a menace. An antique lamp found its way to Johnson's 
Durham, N.C., shop after a distraught fan threw a pillow at the TV set and 
beaned the lamp instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks at Dr. Furniture, with 10 Los Angeles-area locations, have recently 
repaired three items owned by men who confessed to inflicting damage during 
football games, spokesman Burt Noriega says. 
</P>
<P>
 The first call came from a sore loser who slammed the top of the coffee table 
with his hand. The force sheared off the table's legs. 
</P>
<P>
 The second victim was an upholstered sofa. While eating during a game, a fan 
became so distraught that he repeatedly stabbed the sofa arm with his table 
knife.  
</P>
<P>
 The third incident involved a TV stand that buckled when it was kicked 
sometime between the two-minute warning and the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the confessions of admitted abusers. Other offenders plead temporary 
insanity and try to pass off the injuries as household accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 For the customer to come clean "really depends on how stupid the act was," 
says Maaka Nua, a technician for Dr. Furniture. "Often, if they don't tell us 
what happened, their spouses will."  
</P>
<P>
 People (let's just call them men) are loath to admit they creamed the 
television cabinet because their team lost a playoff game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this business almost 30 years, and nobody will admit that they 
took out football frustrations on a table," says Walter Butkus, owner of the 
Hawaiian Gardens-based Butkus Furniture Refinishing.  
</P>
<P>
 But customers readily confess when physical enthusiasm breaks the bed. "They 
seem proud of that," Butkus says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the high-risk season for furniture ends with Sunday's game. 
"Emotions run high," Nua says. "(People) get carried away and somebody will 
kick something. The adrenaline flow behind the kick causes the furniture to 
break. It happens in the heat of the moment." How to Play Defense on Game Day 
Here are some tips for protecting your furniture on Super Bowl Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove all small tables, antique chairs and breakable lamps from the viewing 
room. Also remove any small objects, even soft ones, that could be hurled at 
the television screen. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask viewers to remove their shoes. If they wear boots, insist on it. This 
should lessen the impact of kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use plastic "sporks," the hybrid of spoon and fork, as eating utensils. 
Knives of all kinds should be banished. Patting down your guests would not be 
inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 * When it comes to the menu and decorations, pretend you're throwing a party 
for preschoolers. Encourage your guests to lounge on big overstuffed pillows. 
Serve finger foods and put drinks in plastic cups. Prepare a time-out corner 
for anyone who becomes over-excited.

 Pacific Enterprises -- James R. Ukropina was president of Pacific Enterprises 
from 1986 through 1989, when he became chairman and chief executive. Paul A. 
Miller was chief executive from 1968 through 1989. An article in Thursday's 
editions incorrectly identified Ukropina as chief executive in 1986.

 Wrong gym -- A Ventura County Life story Thursday incorrectly reported that 
the Powerhouse Gym at 880 Hampshire Road in Westlake is closed temporarily due 
to earthquake damage.In fact, it has remained open. It is the Powerhouse Gym at 
411 Central Ave. in Fillmore that is temporarily closed. Dues for a membership 
special at the Westlake location were also wrong. The January special is $199 
for 14 months.

 Kaiser Permanente -- A story in Thursday's editions about new insurance 
options for members of the Kaiser Permanente health plan should have said that 
Kaiser enrollees have the option of using doctors and medical facilities 
outside the Kaiser network -- only in Southern California and only if their 
employers offer it. Throughout the state, Kaiser and Pacific Mutual Life 
Insurance Co. plan to jointly market health plans that would allow employees 
once a year to select either the Kaiser health maintenance plan or Pacific 
Mutual's fee-for-service plan.
