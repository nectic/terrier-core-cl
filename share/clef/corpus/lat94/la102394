HIGH ON PLASTIC; HOW WE WENT FROM CASH ON THE BARRELHEAD TO 'CHARGE IT!' IN 30 
SHORT YEARS; A PIECE OF THE ACTION: HOW THE MIDDLE CLASS JOINED THE MONEY

 Few developments in the last half-century have had a greater impact on the 
lives of everyday Americans than the proliferation of financial services to the 
middle class -- the welcome subject of "A Piece of the Action" by financial 
writer Joseph Nocera. Deploying a large cast of characters and a breezy -- if 
occasionally just a touch too chatty -- writing style, Nocera fills in what is 
literally 30 years of missing history to the story of post-war America: How 
aggressive marketing and one-upmanship by bankers and businessmen all over 
America persuaded everyday folks to give up the virtues of frugality and thrift 
in return for lives that until not so long ago had been the exclusive domain of 
"people of means." Nocera leaves it to the reader to decide whether that is 
something to be applauded or condemned, but he provides enough ammunition to 
keep arguments going for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in fact, scarcely 30 years ago when nearly everyone paid for almost 
everything with cash, when credit cards like Carte Blanche and Diners Club 
(remember them?) still had a certain snob appeal about them, and when no 
homeowner in his right mind would have considered asking the bank for a second 
mortgage in order to pay off some bills, then use the rest to take a vacation 
in Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
 How times have changed. But so too have the living standards of Americans 
along with them. By almost every measure possible -- from outlays for health 
care, to home appliances, to vacation and travel -- the 30-year period of 
America's "money revolution" has seen an unprecedented boom in the consumption 
of the goods and services that nearly everyone would agree are what help make 
life fun to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet where exactly did the money to finance this spending explosion come from? 
Mainly, it would seem, from the financial services industry -- the banks, 
brokerage houses and mutual fund companies that for more than three decades 
have competed with each other to feed (and profit from) the appetites of the 
American middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending upon how one measures it, that industry is today the biggest 
business in America, if not the world. By one recent tally, the average 
American today carries not one but 6.9 different credit cards. What's more, the 
cards are used so freely and often impulsively that the resulting debt balances 
now total close to $309 billion, or nearly 10% of all disposable personal 
income in the country. Moreover, one in eight homeowners now carries a "home 
equity" loan (average size: somewhere around $50,000) on his or her home as 
well, yet another form of consumer spending that was unknown 30 years ago. 
Finally, there's the spectacular growth of the mutual fund industry itself, 
which has reopened the door to Wall Street that had been slammed shut for most 
folks with the Great Depression. As a consequence, 13% of all household 
financial assets in America are today invested in stocks, bonds and other 
financial instruments through mutual funds of various sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing judgment on this process has become, in a sense, the preoccupation of 
post-war American politics. Yet not until "A Piece of the Action" did anyone 
bother to step back and ask how the whole thing actually did happen. When did 
Americans start paying as much attention to the closing numbers of the Dow 
Industrials, as they paid to baseball scores, and why? Who invented the Visa 
card, and why do shoppers now whip that one card out more than 5,000 times a 
minute during the Christmas shopping season? When did Americans become 
interested in gold prices in Hong Kong, and why -- and what special message 
helped Money magazine become the Bible of middle class investors everywhere? 
</P>
<P>
 Questions such as these provide the energy -- and much of the entertainment 
value -- of Nocera's ambitious business history. To be sure, the book is not 
without flaws. At times the narrative seems so broad-ranging and unfocused that 
one has a sense of a writer having stumbled into the research equivalent of a 
land war in Asia. There are also one or two instances in which individuals in 
the story seem to have been treated too harshly. It might be argued, for 
example, that Nocera passes too critical a judgment on Marshall Loeb, the 
irrepressible former editor of Money magazine. It goes too far to suggest -- as 
the book seems to do in a couple of places -- that Loeb intentionally distorted 
facts to give them a sunny, reader-pleasing appeal, or that he willingly 
down-played the risks in the various investments his magazine touted. The fact 
is, as Nocera himself acknowledges, Money's ceaselessly optimistic message to 
invest in stocks and mutual funds turned out to be amazingly good advice. 
Anyone who followed it and put $1,000 into the 30 stocks of the Dow Industrials 
when Loeb took over as Money's editor in March of 1980 would have seen it grow 
to nearly $9,000 by this last September. 
</P>
<P>
 But such nit-picks aside. "A Piece of the Action" has its larger concern 
clearly in focus: The money revolution wasn't the product of a Wall Street 
cabal that set out to enslave and impoverish working people by shoveling debt 
down their throats. Contrary to the view of neo-liberals, the growth of 
America's financial services industry was actually the result of the individual 
competitive actions of an enormous cast of entrepreneurial business people. As 
portrayed by Nocera, all were looking for ways to turn a buck in a world of 
rising middle-class expectations that were constantly being challenged by 
everything from government regulation to commodity-fueled global inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nocera's cast of characters -- many of whom he interviewed for the story -- 
range from Ned Johnson, the chairman of the Fidelity mutual fund empire, to 
chairman John Reed of Citicorp, to Andrew Kahr, the inventor of the "cash 
management account," which was developed through a loophole in the law that 
allowed investment firms to offer customers a service that looked like a 
checking account, only wasn't. Through such personalities, Nocera takes readers 
on a romp across 30 years of what might otherwise have been dull business and 
economic terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 One thus encounters Gerald Tsai, who came to symbolize all that was most 
egregious in the go-go Wall Street of the 1960s. Yet Nocera reminds us Tsai 
actually began his career in the 1950s as a portfolio manager at Fidelity, 
which he left in 1965 after being denied the top spot. Thereafter, Tsai opened 
his own investment shop on Wall Street -- the Manhattan Fund -- catering to 
wealthy high-rollers as the stock market soared higher. But then came 1968, and 
with it the end of Tsai's dream as well as the end of the go-go sixties. Yet 
ironically, Fidelity, the outfit Tsai left, soon emerged as the fast track for 
the era ahead, as middle-class investors, attracted by the stock-picking genius 
of Tsai successor Peter Lynch poured billions into Fidelity, ballooning the 
operation into the biggest mutual fund empire on earth -- something the hapless 
Tsai missed out on entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Or consider the hilariously named Dee Ward Hock, father of the credit card. 
This self-absorbed loan officer from the Midwest was hired by BankAmerica at a 
salary of $40,000 a year in 1970 to rescue the bank's floundering 2-year-old 
credit card venture known as the BankAmericard. By the early 1980s, the 
gruff-spoken Hock had built BankAmericard (renamed Visa) into the largest 
credit card operation in the world, and was earning a salary of more than 
$800,000 a year for his troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Or consider Charles Schwab, a shy 38-year-old money man who had a record of 
failure on Wall Street but figured that his fortunes were do for a turn. 
Specifically, Schwab hoped that the end of fixed exchange rates for brokerage 
firms would give his fly-speck of a firm in San Francisco the opportunity to 
prosper by offering to execute trades for small-time investors at rates that 
would undercut those being charged by Merrill Lynch and other big "wire 
houses." That opportunity came in May, 1975, when Merrill Lynch, then headed by 
Donald T. Regan (eventually to become Ronald Reagan's chief of staff in the 
White House), took advantage of the end of fixed rates not to lower the fees 
for small investors but actually to raise them. Almost instantly, Schwab was 
swamped with orders, which just grew and grew as Charles Schwab & Co. became 
the stock broker to the middle class, just as Fidelity had become its mutual 
fund and VISA its credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 To say that a book filled with middle-aged business executives who sit around 
talking while rarely raising their voices can be worth reading, seems something 
of a stretch. But collectively, these people have done more to change -- and in 
many ways improve -- the lives of everyday Americans than any number of 
Washington politicos you can name. Any educated person ought to know something 
about them, and "A Piece of the Action" is an entertaining way to find out.

WHOSE LIFE IS IT ANYWAY?; HOW A BIOGRAPHER LOST HERSELF IN HER SUBJECT; A 
PASSAGE TO EGYPT: THE LIFE OF LUCIE DUFF GORDON, BY KATHERINE FRANK (HOUGHTON 
MIFFLIN: $24.95; 378 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Antonia Fraser, Antonia Fraser's recent books are The Wives of Henry VIII, a 
finalist for the 1993 Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and The Warrior Queens 
(both Alfred A. Knopf). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1988 Katherine Frank and her husband set out for Egypt to find the grave of 
Lucie Duff Gordon, her latest biographical subject. As the author of 
distinguished works on Emily Bronte and the 19th-Century explorer Mary 
Kingsley, Frank felt the need to pay her respects at the last resting place of 
the English adventuress. 
</P>
<P>
 Then something appalling happened. Instead of looking for the grave of Lady 
Duff Gordon, she found herself having to arrange the burial of her own husband, 
who died suddenly in Cairo four days after their arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is related quite simply, even baldly, at the beginning of Frank's 
biography of Lady Duff Gordon, "A Passage to Egypt": 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after his death he was buried in the Mugattam hills. I could not face 
continuing our journey alone. I left Egypt and returned to England. A long, 
dark, London winter followed. I spent most of it reading and taking notes with 
a kind of feverish intensity in the round, domed Reading Room of the British 
Library. I found refuge there as others might in a church. When I walked 
through the heavy swing doors of the Reading Room, it felt as if I had checked 
my personal identity and grief, as did the tourists their coats and umbrellas 
and cameras in the large entrance lobby of the British Museum." 
</P>
<P>
 Given that the life of Lucie Duff Gordon is also one of female suffering, 
there is no doubt that Frank's story gains a peculiar urgency from the cruel 
personal circumstances in which she found herself. Furthermore, at the end of 
the book, when Frank has tried again -- and failed -- to find Duff Gordon's 
grave, she ties her Prologue to her Epilogue, and gives us what is in effect 
her biographer's credo. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank now accepts that it is better not to have found Lucie's grave: "For, if 
I did, it would signal some sort of completion -- a death, in fact -- and the 
end of my remembering. I understood now that however much we yearn to possess 
the past, it is not of our creation. Our rememberings are partial -- versions 
crafted of collected fragments -- and this means the pursuit is never finished. 
Yet the past is real and true, however fragmentarily we recover it. Above all 
it is not over. It is down there in the pool of time, and we sit on the shore 
and cast our lines . . . sometimes glimpsing in the shadowy depths, the faint 
but iridescent light of resurrection." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be clear from this that Frank's approach is not the theoretically 
objective one of the run of biographers. Many of us probably have personal 
experiences during the long, arduous years of research that may disturb us like 
uneasy phantoms when we read certain passages of our own text. In my own case, 
without having endured an experience anything as traumatic as that of Katherine 
Frank, I still feel an unease come over me when reading certain passages of my 
1984 book "The Weaker Vessel," a somewhat autobiographical tale of female 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank, however, boldly grasps the mantle of the biographer's objectivity and 
throws it aside. She intends to share with us not only the ordeals of her 
heroine but also her own, in an attempt to come to terms with her own past. To 
be honest, I might not have warmed toward such a method in advance, had it been 
described to me. What about scholarly impartiality? Yet the fact is that I 
feel, in Frank's case, it succeeds triumphantly. I found the various strands in 
"A Passage to Egypt" woven together skillfully and poignantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucie Duff Gordon is not a major figure in our imaginations today (less famous 
than Mary Kingsley, a great deal less famous than Emily Bronte) yet she led a 
colorful, as well as a tragic life that has interesting things to tell us about 
the female lot in the 19th Century. She was born Lucie Austin in 1821 to a 
depressed hypochondriacal father and a spirited mother, Sarah, who had waited 
five years for her marriage, in the course of which she was put through an 
educational program to make her worthy of her future spouse. The Austin 
household remained an intellectual one, and John Austin's private tuition of a 
15-year-old called John Stuart Mill was to have important consequences for his 
daughter. In the meantime it was thanks to the Austins that John Stuart Mill 
came in time to develop his passion for the young married woman Harriet Taylor 
who lived next door to them. 
</P>
<P>
 As Austin descended into melancholy (and poverty) the splendid Sarah took on 
work as a translator and a teacher in order to support the family. As Frank 
points out, Lucie's parents' marriage reversed the conventional roles of 
husband and wife; as Austin became increasingly passive and dependent, Sarah, 
of necessity, became more and more capable and energetic. "I have to act," she 
wrote to a friend, "I am the man of business in our firm." As the shift of 
power occurred between the Austin parents, Sarah also developed a long-distance 
friendship with a German author, Prince Hermann von Puckler-Muskau, in which 
sexual fantasies played their part (which were to be brutally dispelled when 
the pair, after some years, finally met). 
</P>
<P>
 Frank deals at length with Lucie's childhood and youth in order to explain the 
making of such an unconventional creature as she proved to be. Lucie's marriage 
to the glamorous Sir Alexander Duff Gordon, at the age of 18, was more of a 
conventional step, however, as though she had had enough of her parents' 
Bohemian way of life. Now she could have her own literary salon: one of which 
any hostess could be proud -- for it included Dickens, Thackeray and Tennyson. 
The great poet, Heinrich Heine, was her friend. The marriage was a happy one. 
Frank makes this clear (although her language slips for once into banality -- 
surprisingly so): "Now Lucie was married to an exceedingly handsome husband, 10 
years her senior and probably sexually experienced. And they were passionately 
in love. She must have found the sexual expression of that love an exciting 
revelation." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the reader -- and the book -- is rescued from this trough by the 
very tragedy which both struck Lucie down and transformed her life. 
Tuberculosis, that dreaded 19th-Century killer, condemned her to life in a hot 
dry climate. She went without husband or children. The conjugal visits that 
followed were on the whole disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the disease really condemn her? Or did perhaps something deep within Lucie 
Duff Gordon rebel against the entire life of a hostess that she left behind? 
Certainly Lucie Duff Gordon's last years -- she died in 1868 at the age of 48 
-- seem to have been happy ones as she took to the life of the East, despite 
the ravages of her illness. Some of her communications to her husband are 
either naive or provocative -- or maybe a bit of both. Of the superb black 
Nubians she admired, she wrote: "I was in raptures at seeing how superb an 
animal man (and woman) really is." Yet to her husband, she commented 
significantly: "I wish you would come, but the heat here which gives me life 
would be quite impossible to you." 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of the East, the adoption of the personality of Noor ala Noor -- 
her Arab name -- make Lucie Duff Gordon one of the many European romantics who 
have turned away from their own culture. Of course she did so on her own terms: 
numerous servants, both English and Arab, pepper the pages of this story, and 
when Lucie's maid became pregnant by her favorite Egyptian servant, Lucie can 
hardly be said to have behaved well. Yet the impression remains: Life for an 
Englishwoman in the 19th Century was so maddeningly frustrating, the bonds that 
tied even the most unconventional so tight, that it was better to wander as 
Lucie did, disease-ridden but free. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucie Duff Gordon must lie happy in her Egyptian "unvisited tomb," in the 
words of George Eliot, more happily than she would have lain in some English 
cemetery. In any case, Katherine Frank has brought her brilliantly back to 
life.

WHOSE LIFE IS IT ANYWAY?; WHY ONE PREFERS A BIOGRAPHER OF ONE'S OWN; KEEPERS OF 
THE FLAME: LITERARY ESTATES AND THE RISE OF BIOGRAPHY, BY IAN HAMILTON (FABER & 
FABER: $24.95; 344 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Victoria Glendinning, Victoria Glendinning is a biographer whose books 
include Vita: A Life of Vita Sackville West (Morrow) and Anthony Trollope 
(Alfred A. Knopf). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is posterity? Nothing but "an unending jostle of vanities, appetites and 
fears," concludes Ian Hamilton at the end of a book that is quite surprisingly 
entertaining and suggestive. One might not suppose that a work subtitled 
"Literary Estates and the Rise of Biography" would give one cause to laugh 
aloud, but it does. Hamilton is a British poet, an editor and himself the 
biographer of Robert Lowell and, notoriously, of J. D. Salinger (well, he 
tried). For all his scholarship, he writes here with the immediacy, economy and 
ease of a witty man talking over a bottle of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 The "keepers of the flame" are the friends, relations, devotees, literary 
executors and biographers, in whose hands lies what Hamilton calls the 
"after-fame" of great writers. We live in an era of copious, candid and some 
would say intrusive, biography. The questions Hamilton addresses about the 
history and ethics of the genre were never more topical. "How much should a 
biographer tell? How much should an executor suppress? And what would the 
biographee have wanted -- do we know?" 
</P>
<P>
 He proceeds chronologically, by means of case-histories, each marking some 
change or development in the perceived function of the custodians of greatness. 
This leads us into the history of publishing and of the law on copyright, into 
the company of some egregious crooks and creeps, and into some stimulatingly 
unprovable statements from Hamilton. The poet and priest John Donne (d. 1631), 
for example, was "the first" important writer to leave a substantial collection 
of letters, and his no-good son was "the first" to see that there was money to 
be made from a literary parent's leavings. Edmund Curll, the 18th-Century 
publisher, was "the first" to cash in on scurrilous instant biographies. Robert 
Burns was "the first" to have his frailties exposed by a biographer (he drank 
himself to death). Just occasionally, Hamilton is wrong. He writes that 
Thackeray's daughter "vetoed all thoughts of a biography," thus fueling 
speculation about skeletons in cupboards; in fact, she commissioned Trollope to 
write a book about her father, which he did. Admittedly, she gave him very 
little material to work on. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is full of tasty details about cabinets and laundry-baskets of 
letters and manuscripts falling into greedy hands, or being used as wrapping 
paper for groceries. Keepers of the flame tended to be self-appointed. The poet 
Marvell's landlady posed as his wife in order to get money owed to his estate. 
Sir William Davenant liked it to be thought that he was Shakespeare's 
illegitimate son. Thomas Hardy had the bright idea of controlling his 
after-fame by ghosting his own biography, ostensibly authored by his second 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is free from academic pedantry. Hamilton remarks that Johnson's life 
of Dryden contains "the funniest and cruellest" of the "many wildly improbable" 
accounts of Dryden's funeral, quoting none of them, and thus whetting the 
reader's desire to find out more. Likewise, he writes of William Warburton, the 
adviser and editor of Alexander Pope, that Pope guided him to a rich wife "and 
then (via her very rich uncle) to a bishopric and a palatial estate." Most 
scholars would have ruined their narrative flow by dutifully identifying, if 
only in a footnote, the "very rich uncle." 
</P>
<P>
 Not Ian Hamilton. His pace and semi-satirical tone extract the maximum 
entertainment value from pompous literary mayhem. He writes with informed 
malice about the frequent rivalry between a dead author's self-aggrandizing 
"best friends" as to who is the true keeper of the flame. Disciples are often 
catty about co-disciples. One reviewer of "The Life of Dickens" by his friend 
and champion John Forster complained that it "should not be called 'The Life of 
Dickens' but 'The History of Dickens' Relations to Mr. Forster.' " Yet Forster 
was cavalier about his hero's materials. He chopped extracts out of Dickens' 
letters (discarding the tattered remains) and pasted them into his manuscript, 
which was thrown away afterward by the printers. Boswell was the most 
successful flame-keeper of all time, making the relationship between subject 
and biographer the central pillar of his "Life of Dr. Johnson," to the extent 
that Boswell is now a more lively commercial proposition than Johnson himself. 
</P>
<P>
 They believed in "definitive" biography in the past, and possessive jealousy 
such as John Forster's found destruction preferable to the gaze of alien eyes. 
John Cam Hobhouse, neurotically possessive about the late Lord Byron, 
engineered the burning of his idol's autobiography, unread, because it had been 
shown to Tom Moore and not to him. Hobhouse was uneasy lest there might be 
something uncomplimentary about himself in it. 
</P>
<P>
 When Henry James was given a private view of Byron's scandalous private papers 
he was so appalled that he went home and destroyed 40 years accumulation of his 
own correspondence, manuscripts and notebooks, expressing an "utter and 
absolute abhorrence" of any biography of himself. And what was the upshot? Leon 
Edel's five-volume "Life of Henry James," and four volumes of letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry James did not have much to hide, or else it remains hidden. He is an 
exception. Readers are sometimes shocked when they discover that authors whose 
books they admire were less than admirable in private life. Hamilton poses the 
most difficult question that biographers and critics must address: "Does poetic 
genius excuse or mitigate bad conduct; does/should knowing about the life have 
a bearing on how we read the work?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, most spouses and devotees thought it their duty to 
suppress all evidence of "bad conduct." Biographers worked "to the sound of 
snipping scissors and paper crackling in the grate. . . . After the funeral 
would come the slamming of doors, the scrubbing of marble and then, within two 
years or so, the emergence of what Gladstone called 'a reticence in three 
volumes.' " George Eliot's reputation for unrelenting high seriousness was 
largely established by her widower cutting all jokes and familiar turns of 
speech out of her published letters and journals. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems remain much the same today. The biographer of a modern subject is 
caught between wanting to tell "the truth" and the need to maintain good 
relations with informants and access to the archive. The eternal dispute, as 
identified by Henry James, between "the public and the private, between 
curiosity and delicacy" may have been resolved to Kitty Kelley's satisfaction, 
but it still exercises most biographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming to our own time, Hamilton is sharp about the costiveness of T. S. 
Eliot's widow in publishing his letters and declining to authorize a biography, 
while she allows Eliot's words to be mixed with Trevor Nunn's in the song 
"Memory" in the lucrative show Cats; Hamilton pays tribute to Peter Ackroyd's 
subtly "widow-proof" account of Eliot's life. Yet he shows sympathy with Ted 
Hughes who, as he writes, cannot even destroy any of his own private papers 
without being accused of interfering with "Plath Studies." 
</P>
<P>
 This book was first published in Britain two years ago -- before the very 
pertinent furor caused by the publication of the biography of Philip Larkin by 
Andrew Motion and of Larkin's Letters, before the contentious overview of the 
saga of the Plath biographies by Janet Malcolm in the New Yorker (issued Aug. 
23 and 30, 1993), before the proposal for a new and Draconian "Privacy Bill" in 
Britain, and before it was decided that the 50-year copyright period should be 
increased in Britain to 70 years, in the interests of harmonization within the 
European Union. It would have been helpful, in the American edition, to have 
had an afterword on these matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton's own position is that writers must, in the first instance, be their 
own keepers of the flame: In other words, having read this review, you should 
at once burn all your diaries and love-letters. Or not; as Isaak Walton wrote 
in the 17th Century, a wish for self-perpetuation is "rooted in the very nature 
of man." But you should never, Hamilton thinks, burn anyone else's private 
papers. Larkin in his last illness requested that his diaries be destroyed. His 
friend Monica Jones shredded the 25 volumes within hours of his death. She did 
not have to. However vehement the wishes of the deceased in this regard, you 
are not in (British) law obliged to fulfill them. 
</P>
<P>
 There are evidently still moral imperatives stronger than the tug of literary 
history or the law of the land. But there's little any author can do about 
eliminating indiscreet letters written to other people; they are probably 
already in the Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin 
anyway, nicely filed and catalogued. Only the law of copyright, and a stalwart 
keeper of the flame, can protect you. On the evidence of this book, writers 
should choose the keepers of their flame very carefully indeed. As Dryden wrote 
to his young protege, the playwright Congreve: 
</P>
<P>

THE BUSINESS OF AMERICA; COMEBACK: THE FALL AND RISE OF THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE 
INDUSTRY, BY PAUL INGRASSIA AND JOSEPH B. WHITE (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $25; 496 
PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Calvin Coolidge didn't say much, but his announcement that "The 
business of America is business" ought to be considered a worthy substitute for 
"In God We Trust" on our paper money, since the closest thing to heaven for 
most Americans is a profitable bottom line. Of all the businesses in this 
country, the one that has been most closely identified with, and provided the 
economic underpinnings for, our national being is the manufacture of motor 
vehicles, primarily automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The success and failure of the Big Three American car companies is measured 
almost daily by the media: as Detroit goes, so does a substantial portion of 
the American economy, and the American psyche. The decade of the 1980s was 
first boom and then bust for General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, all of which 
suffered mightily at the hands of Japanese competitors and the hubris of their 
top executives. 
</P>
<P>
 As recounted in fascinating detail by Paul Ingrassia and Joseph B. White (who 
cover the auto business for the Wall Street Journal, where they won a Pulitzer 
Prize together for their stories on GM), all three companies had to lose 
billions of dollars, in two cases -- Chrysler and, incredibly, GM -- barely 
skirting total economic collapse before they recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 That such large, established manufacturers could perform so miserably appears 
to have been the result of a narrow-minded executive elite enjoying its boom 
times by throwing corporate money around. That corporate chieftains are out of 
touch with middle- or working-class America is no surprise: to be picked up by 
a waiting car on the Tarmac after a ride in a corporate jet is to enjoy a 
particularly pleasant form of social insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 What you learn reading this book is that the perks are available down the 
pecking order. One doesn't even have to be a corporate officer at Ford to get a 
new, company-leased car every year, with parking provided in the executive 
garage, where the car is filled with gas daily and washed three times a week. 
To take care of their families, executives at this level could lease two more 
cars at "favorable" rates and obtain low-cost insurance for those cars, a big 
saving if there's a teen-age driver. Corporate generosity extends past the 
executive's working life: In retirement he (it's almost always a he) continues 
to get a leased car. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of retirement, it is instructive to learn that one departing GM 
chairman managed to sneak a $600,000 increase in his pension past his board of 
directors, who remained unaware that they had approved doubling his package 
until a reporter later deciphered a proxy statement. By then the damage was 
done, and the board was too embarrassed to admit openly that they had been 
snookered. 
</P>
<P>
 In the insular world of Detroit auto execs, the early 1980s were so profitable 
that anything seemed possible. General Motors bought Hughes Aircraft for $5 
billion, beating Ford's $4-billion offer. GM spent billions and billions on 
automated factories, while at the same time signing labor contracts that kept 
the work force in place. The bloated number of workers couldn't make the new 
machines operate properly. A production expert from Toyota, invited to visit 
GM's most high-tech plant, was asked what he thought after he walked through. 
"They have many problems," the Toyota man replied, "that they have not thought 
of yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford used its vast amount of cash to buy a savings and loan and two consumer 
lending companies, then spent $2.5 billion to outbid GM for Britain's 
prestigious but financially ailing Jaguar. (The then-head of Jaguar preferred a 
partnership with GM, rather than outright ownership by Ford, saying, "When an 
elephant gets in bed with a mouse, two things happen -- the elephant doesn't 
have much fun, and the mouse gets killed.") 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler, the smallest of the Big Three, paid $636 million for Gulfstream, 
$400 million for FinanceAmerica and $200 million for American Motors (but had 
to assume $700 million of its debt and $300 million in unfunded pensions). Then 
it started a joint venture with the Italian manufacturer Maserati to produce 
luxury two-seat coupes, which wound up costing $400 million for 7,300 cars. 
With another bad joint venture -- to produce and sell a Renault model under the 
Eagle name -- and some plant shifts and closings, Chrysler went through $4.85 
billion, money the company didn't use to develop new cars or engines. 
</P>
<P>
 When sales dropped off after the 1987 stock market crash and ensuing (in 
California and other places, continuing) recession, Detroit's manufacturers 
were drowning in red ink. Their recovery seems to be due to new leadership at 
all three companies, as well as a willingness to listen to and put into 
practice the ideas of mid-level executives who learned how the Japanese 
manufacture cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it helps mightily that the dollar has tumbled so far against the 
yen that even compact American cars now enjoy a $2,000 price advantage against 
their direct Japanese competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 One factual quibble: The authors repeat a couple of times that Ford's 
introduction of the Taurus in late 1985 "revolutionized automobile styling 
around the world," ignoring the fact that the Taurus was a softer version of 
British Ford's Sierra, which had hit U.K. showrooms in fall of 1982; it hadn't 
sold well, the British car magazines declared, because its aerodynamic shape 
was too advanced for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the book is filled with phrases that are the literary equivalent of 
the 1980s boxy Chrysler K-Cars or the Pontiac Fiero (which had the annoying 
habit of bursting into flames): A GM exec "came through in the clutch"; "It 
quickly became apparent that this coupe was no coup." Executives are "top 
guns," "marketing mavens" and "heavy hitters." These caveats notwithstanding, 
"Comeback" is an absorbing, cautionary tale about corporate behavior in an 
industry that creates the one product necessary both for basic transportation 
and to define our individual personality.

RICHARD EDER: NOCTURNAL AWAKENINGS; A COLLECTION OF DREAMS GRAHAME GREENE 
SELECTED AND JOTTED DOWN OVER A 20-YEAR PERIOD; A WORLD OF MY OWN: A DREAM 
DIARY, BY GRAHAM GREENE (VIKING: $21.95; 144 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Graham Greene enters a poetry competition and manages one line: "Beauty makes 
crime noble." Suddenly: "I was interrupted by a criticism flung at me from 
behind bS. Eliot. 'What does that mean? How can crime be noble?' He had, I 
noticed, grown a mustache." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham Greene is dividing a wartime ration of bread, and offers General de 
Gaulle a share. " 'Crust or crumb, mon general?' I asked him, but looking at 
the bread I saw how little was left of either. 'Better both,' I told him, and 
gave him all that was left." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a faintly ghostly circumstance that the first of Greene's books to 
appear after his death -- and perhaps the only one -- should be a collection of 
his dreams. It is not a posthumous collection, however. He worked carefully to 
select and order them from the dreams he had jotted down over 20 years. And, as 
Yvonne Cloetta, his longtime companion, writes in her foreword, "One of the 
pleasures of this book is the obvious pleasure he took in his selection." That 
gets to the heart of it; and it is one key to why an unpromising venture holds 
an unpredictable allure. 
</P>
<P>
 I would not want Graham Greene to tell me his dreams; any more than I would 
want a friend to, or the grocer or, for that matter, Sigmund Freud. But for 
Greene to write his dreams is another matter. He was, you see, a writer. If his 
books varied in quality and flagged toward the end, his writing did not. Its 
voice, in its style and angled way of reacting to the public and private world, 
comes close to irresistible for anyone hooked on it. Not everyone is, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a long way between telling ones dreams and what Greene did. He kept 
notebook and pencil beside his bed, woke to scrawl key words and used them in 
the morning to construct a tiny polished narrative. It is the difference 
between the work of dreaming and the work of the imagination; between a steam 
geyser and a steam engine. The latter takes you to real places. Not the dreams 
themselves, but the stories he tells about them, are the real -- odd, 
admittedly -- places that Greene takes us to. 
</P>
<P>
 "A World of My Own" is the title he gives his book; it is the closest he could 
come to an autobiography after "A Sort of Life," which got him through his 
early years. (The assorted pieces in "Ways of Escape" are autobiographical 
feints and glances.) By writing about dreams he can insert real people into a 
world entirely his own, he tells us in his introduction. "There are no 
witnesses. No libel actions." (Still, he withholds his erotic dreams.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the dreams seem purely absurd; yet something more, as well. Greene 
finds himself "on an agreeable river trip to Bogota in the company of Henry 
James." It is crowded and uncomfortable and he suggests debarking, "But no, 
James wouldn't hear of it. We must go on to the bitter end. 'For scientific 
reasons,' he told me." It is the comically premonitory shadow in an Edward 
Gorey drawing, or in such Lewis Carroll verses as: 
</P>
<P>
 He thought he saw a banker's clerk  
</P>
<P>
 Descending from a bus.  
</P>
<P>
 He looked again and saw it was  
</P>
<P>
 A hippopotamus.  
</P>
<P>
 If it should stay to dine, he thought,  
</P>
<P>
 There won't be much for us.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the absurd is more pointed; sometimes more suggestive. He stays at 
the country house of Sir Alec Douglas-Home, the patrician Tory prime minister 
whose politics and thin smile no doubt represented everything Greene couldn't 
stand about his country. Visiting the host's bedroom, he is irritated by his 
silk pajamas, "although they were almost indistinguishable from my own." A 
manservant is sweeping up. "The chandelier had fallen and shattered. 'Lucky it 
didn't fall on your head,' I remarked. 'That goes without saying,' Sir Alec 
replied with a kind of cold satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 A son of the upper-middle class, Greene in his dreams is not unsusceptible to 
a title. (Those identical pajamas.) He sits beside the Queen at church and the 
sermon has them both in barely controlled stitches. She charitably covers his 
face with a program; later, when Prince Philip turns up in scoutmaster uniform 
she confides to Greene: "I can't bear the way he smiles." 
</P>
<P>
 Get to popes and things become more serious, though not with John XXIII whom 
Greene loved. While John is blessing the sea, three Englishmen persist in 
splashing him. Greene takes them aside to scold them; they are the writer 
Raymond Mortimer, the art historian Sir Kenneth Clark and the Earl of 
Southampton. With John Paul II, whose leadership he deplores, the dreams are 
stiffer except for one, curiously mixed. Hearing that the Pope is about to 
commit the presumption of canonizing Christ, Greene goes to look for him on the 
seawall at Antibes. John Paul passes him, walking slowly toward town. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was dressed in an old pair of dirty white trousers and a green pullover. 
There was something pathetic in his disarray, and for the first time I felt a 
little sorry for him." John Paul is walking into "Greene-land," where the 
Church wears rags and where, who knows, Greene may pardon even a Pope. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene runs across Castro, Khrushchev, Ford Madox Ford (out strolling with a 
young bull on his back), Auden (whom he stabs), Goebbels (he sticks a poisoned 
cigarette up his nose) and others including two talking dogs. He dreams up 
Boswell on farting: "The Canons kept the wind under their robes until the smell 
cold be attributed to the ladies, or else the ladies had waited until the wind 
could be attributed to the Canons." 
</P>
<P>
 One dream is simply about happiness: a train full of passengers in Edwardian 
costume who welcome him affectionately. Another carries the anguish of failing 
powers. He reads the late "Getting to Know the General" and finds it 
"unreasonably bad." Working on "Monsignor Quixote," "I realized that a whole 
long stretch of it was boring." He reads a love passage to a woman he loves. 
"But I know that the whole book was hopeless. I said 'If only I could die 
before the book is published. It's got to be published to earn money for the 
family.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He dreams of death -- "a great black cone like a candle extinguisher was to be 
dropped over my head" -- but if not a happy dream, it is a light one. He has 
entered a newspaper competition with a poem that describes his own death. 
"Needless to say, the paper never received it." And he dreams -- sleeping? 
waking? -- the verse. It ends: 
</P>
<P>
 My breath is folded up  
</P>
<P>
 Like sheets in lavender.  
</P>
<P>
 The end for me  
</P>
<P>
 Arrives like nursery tea.

COVER STORY; NOT JUST AN EXERCISE IN FUTILITY; PUBLIC ART IS ALMOST ALWAYS 
CONTROVERSIAL, BUT SOMETIMES IT'S EVEN POPULAR. AS IT BECOMES MORE COMMONPLACE, 
ISN'T IT WORTH CONSIDERING A FEW PIECES THAT REALLY WORK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Christopher Knight, Christopher Knight is a Times art critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "Great Wall of L.A.," unfurling for nearly half a mile along an unlovely 
concrete flood channel that slices through Van Nuys and North Hollywood, must 
surely rank among the largest paintings anywhere in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural, a loosely linked sequence of 41 scenes painted intermittently 
between 1976 and 1983, tells an almost cinematic history of California from the 
prehistoric era to the present day. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the oddity of its mammoth size, the mural also ranks as a 
significant and compelling work of public art -- a standing that is no small 
achievement in that typically beleaguered realm. Notable successes in the 
public-art genre are less than abundant, even though the field is increasing in 
visibility throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 What is it that makes some public art echo and resound in the imagination, 
while most of it just sort of sits there, looking variously pompous or forlorn, 
annoying or indifferent, in the way or out of place? 
</P>
<P>
 Why do some works of art seem born to vividly inhabit the public realm, rather 
than to require the more enclosed world of the gallery and museum? 
</P>
<P>
 The question is worth considering, in part because public art is becoming 
commonplace in L.A. and in part because the genre is itself of great 
significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Art is necessary to a civilized world. Throughout history, governments of all 
kinds have been principal patrons for art; in order to achieve a civilized 
democracy, public patronage needs to generate art in the public realm. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation of public art locally is a result of the cumulative effects 
of federal, state and city laws, which began with the National Endowment for 
the Arts' Art in Public Places program of the late 1960s. Today, more than half 
the states and dozens of cities mandate percent-for-art commitments from a mix 
of public and private developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica, Culver City and Los Angeles are among local governments that 
require a portion of redevelopment or city construction funds to be devoted to 
the commissioning or acquisition of public works of art. A big boost has come 
from Metro Rail, with its highly visible $10-million Art for Rail Transit 
project, which has involved artists in subway station design. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to government, a few private local entities also have become 
involved. Foundations and independent real-estate developers commission art 
intended not for private consumption but for the public realm. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversies certainly aren't alien to the subject. Sometimes a specific work 
causes a flap, as happened in 1991 when a congressman and a federal judge 
objected to a new sculptural ensemble by Tom Otterness at the Roybal Federal 
Building downtown. (Their objections did not prevail.) 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, as in a recent storm in Culver City over whether or not the 
quality of newly built architecture could legitimately satisfy a 
percent-for-art requirement, it is the larger philosophy of public art that 
takes the heat. (That stew still simmers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Producing public art is becoming so familiar an activity in Los Angeles, while 
issues surrounding the topic remain not unexpectedly blurred, that a four-day 
conference, including two days of panel discussions Friday and Saturday at the 
Biltmore Hotel, was hatched to explore its many facets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public Art: Realities, Theories and Issues," with backing from the California 
Arts Council, the Community Redevelopment Agency and the city's Cultural 
Affairs Department, will attempt to address the subject from as many angles as 
possible.  
</P>
<P>
 There is, of course, no single magic-bullet answer to the question of why some 
public art works and most doesn't. The "Great Wall of L.A." was collectively 
produced by scores of muralists drawn from various communities -- a sampling of 
the public, you could say, engaged in making public art -- but other, similarly 
conceived and executed murals don't come close to exerting the imaginative pull 
of the "Great Wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Systematic formulas just don't work for art -- which is not to say they don't 
get tried. For instance, a ruling convention of public art today is that a 
thorough understanding of the public site in which the work will exist is 
crucial to the art's success. 
</P>
<P>
 So some artists try to comprehend a site by becoming researchers -- an amateur 
historian, sociologist, demographer, anthropologist. The art they produce 
illustrates what has been discovered during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the dullest, most tediously academic public art gets made that way. 
Still, not only does the method flourish, it's even taught in art schools. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason it thrives is that it makes for an art that's easy to explain. And 
public art, unlike art made in the privacy of the studio, usually needs 
explaining -- lots of it, even before it ever gets made. The plan needs to be 
explained to patrons and committees of bureaucrats and review boards and 
politicians and funding agencies -- any or all of whom may regard modern art 
with suspicion. The show-and-tell school eases doubts by giving everyone a 
comfortable little story to embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom also has it that abstract art is best avoided in public 
places, since abstraction is supposedly incompatible with the interests of a 
wider public. If that's true, why is it that Maya Lin's breathtaking Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial in Washington, the single greatest -- and most widely beloved 
-- work of contemporary public art in the United States, is an abstract 
sculpture? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neither a brilliant artistic form, by itself, nor a rich public site, by 
itself, is enough to galvanize a work of public art. Necessary instead is a 
sparkling dialogue between them. And the dialogue, as with any public 
conversation, won't be worth much unless there are plenty of openings for an 
eavesdropping public to pipe in. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculptor Siah Armajani, who has designed several successful works of public 
art around the country, once explained the crucial importance of coaxing forth 
the hidden parameters of context when making public art. It demands something 
other than the inert illustrated research so prominent today. 
</P>
<P>
 "In public art," Armajani told interviewer Calvin Tomkins in 1990, "there is 
no room for focus on the ego. You have to get lost in the context of the work." 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom has long held that the free reign of artistic ego can 
wreak havoc with art destined for the public realm. Conventional wisdom has 
been right. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it hasn't gone the full distance. Notice that Armajani did not specify 
whose intrusive ego could pose problems. Nor did he limit the identity of who 
it is that finally needs to be released, able "to get lost in the context of 
the work." 
</P>
<P>
 The often disregarded fact is this: It isn't only the artist's ego that must 
be consciously set aside for successful public art, because there are two sides 
in the public art equation. The bumptious ego of the patron can inflict just as 
much havoc as the intrusive ego of the artist. 
</P>
<P>
 When the public or its representatives -- the patrons for public art -- demand 
that its prideful vision of itself be put on perpetual display, there is no 
more room for viewers "to get lost in the context" than there is when an 
artist's bloated sense of self is grandly filling up the space. 
</P>
<P>
 For evidence, look around town. Although the numbers are modest -- Los Angeles 
has lagged somewhat behind cities such as New York, Chicago and even Seattle in 
generating public art -- some exceptional work has indeed been completed here 
in the last 10 or 12 years. Its variety offers a sense of the scope to which 
the genre aspires, as well as the range of commissioning mechanisms through 
which it comes into being. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is a selection, by no means comprehensive, of five well-known 
works of public art. The list was assembled to reflect a variety of types of 
projects, commissioned in a variety of ways. Two were made by a relatively new 
class of American painters and sculptors who regard themselves specifically as 
public artists; three were not. 
</P>
<P>
 If this diverse group can be said to have anything in common, it is not just 
the creation of an interesting object, image or place to be looked at or used 
-- although of course they have all done that. 
</P>
<P>
 Critical to their success is the uncanny power those objects and places have 
to galvanize the environment where they appear. For public art, context is 
crucial. 'Great Wall of L.A.' 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Baca and the Mural Makers 
</P>
<P>
 A n African aphorism asserts that it's the lions who get to tell the story of 
the lambs. In the "Great Wall of L.A.," the lambs assertively take their place 
at the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting, formally titled the "Tujunga Wash Mural: History of California," 
begins with a bit of dinosaur-studded prehistory, quickly jumps ahead to the 
early migration of settlers from Asia in the first millennium and then gets 
right to its main purpose: telling episodic stories of the struggles between 
repression and liberation for ethnic minorities, women, Jews, gay men and 
lesbians, Dust Bowl refugees, labor organizers, political dissidents and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Other events do get chronicled along the way, such as the development of the 
movie industry and the mobilization of citizen troops in World Wars I and II. 
But, with rare exception, this is not a history of the state as told through 
the lives of Establishment figures. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, it is also a monument to the expansiveness of the civil rights 
movement during the fateful period in which the mural was made, as well as to 
the muralists who made it. The painting was executed in five big chunks -- 
1976, 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1983 -- by five groups of mural makers, mostly young 
people and principally led by artist Judy Baca, who conceived the project and 
found the funds to do it. Altogether, the names of 187 muralists are listed on 
the wall, while a shifting array of government, corporate and private sponsors 
is also identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Great Wall" builds on an important Chicano tradition of assembling fluid, 
multifaceted yet structured groups of people in order to establish a vital 
interaction between aesthetic goals and social engagement. The mural's makers 
would research and select historical episodes for depiction, and these would be 
developed into pictorial form under the supervision of Baca and other lead 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 That organizational sense of "structured fluidity" is bracingly reflected in 
the mural's composition, which unspools as a continuous narrative. Its 41 
scenes are not isolated, independent events, rendered like discrete panels in a 
comic strip. Instead, symbolically charged, sometimes witty episodes flow in 
and out of one another, across the wall's horizontal expanse. 
</P>
<P>
 T he visual effect is to endow the imagery of sociopolitical striv ing with a 
sense of both timelessness and presentness. The human struggle for independence 
is shown to have a long history, while every episode reverberates against every 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Stylistically, a sharp break occurs in 1980. The two earlier mural segments 
speak with the untrained visual eloquence of folk art; the three subsequent 
ones suddenly pump up the volume, evolving into a highly sophisticated graphic 
montage with a distinctly Pop sensibility -- Jose Clemente Orozco meets Madison 
Avenue. The shift suggests a new status and strategy for the mural's subject. 
</P>
<P>
 In an extraordinary metaphorical engagement of its physical context, the huge 
mural unfolds along a half-mile stretch of the Tujunga Wash, which is part of 
the San Fernando Valley's flood-control system feeding into the Los Angeles 
River. The mural runs parallel to Coldwater Canyon Avenue, stretching along the 
western wall from Burbank Boulevard to Oxnard Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tujunga Wash flood channel is a concrete scar, an ugly waste space 
necessitated by the water-management system pivotal to L.A.'s history. The 
broad, deep channel cuts through middle-class suburban neighborhoods on its way 
from Hansen Dam to the river. Where the channel passes Grant High School, the 
mural suddenly appears. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural's content, celebratory and defiant, sends an electric current 
through a trash-strewn no-man's-land, which stands as silent testimony to a 
complex web of civic power relations in L.A.'s history. That the chronological 
pageant unfolds northward against the flood-channel's southward flow adds a 
subtle grace note to its imagery of struggle against the tide.

 'Corporate Head" is that rare accomplishment, a laugh- out-loud-funny 
sculpture backed by a percussive resonance that lingers long after the smile 
wanes. Immediately accessible as an image -- watch for a few minutes as 
passersby instinctively engage with the playful work of art -- the sculpture 
peels back in provocative layers. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Allen's bronze figure of an anonymous businessman, nattily dressed in 
suit and tie and carrying a trim briefcase at his side, bends at the waist 
before the entrance to downtown's towering Citicorp Plaza. The familiar pose 
suggests a simple act of homage at the gates of a royal palace of modern 
American life. Simultaneously, it presents the figure's ignominious backside to 
the bustling crowds who hurriedly ascend the steps behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 One more thing: The bronze businessman has no head. Or, rather, his neck 
disappears into the pinkish granite slab of the office tower that rises before 
him, just beneath the polished-brass numbers that announce, "725 South 
Figueroa." Suddenly, the urban environment for blocks around takes on the vivid 
glow of a gargantuan Conceptual art project: the businessman's brain made 
manifest. 
</P>
<P>
 Yikes! 
</P>
<P>
 The slightly larger-than-life-size figure, who would be about 7 feet tall if 
he could stand upright, is at once funny, threatening and poignant. He is part 
blockhead, part uniformed automaton, part human fly trapped in modern amber; we 
instantly recognize him as -- us. 
</P>
<P>
 A brass plaque embedded in the ground at the sculpture's feet carries Philip 
Levine's brief poem: 
</P>
<P>
 They said / I had a head / for business. / They said / to get ahead /I had to 
lose / my head. / They said /be concrete / & I became concrete. /They said / 
go, my son / multiply, /divide, conquer. / I did my best.  
</P>
<P>
 As you bend to read the wingtip-warrior's words, you assume the bowed position 
of the businessman, and take your place in line behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corporate Head," a 1991 collaboration between a poet and an artist, writer 
and musician, is the outstanding commission for Citicorp Plaza's Poets' Walk, a 
group of half a dozen collaborative projects between artists and poets 
scattered about the building's ground-floor public spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 In this devastatingly concise and thoughtful sculpture, the Western civic 
tradition of the hero rendered in bronze is brought with conviction and 
humanity into the contemporary world, after having languished for nearly a 
century.

</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Borofsky 
</P>
<P>
 E veryone is comfortably famil iar with the gesturing giants that provide 
eccentric signage for commercial businesses, like the friendly genies that loom 
over Carpeteria stores or the grinning Big Boys that gleefully offer a gigantic 
burger to passing motorists. The colossuses of roadside America are pop-public 
sculptures, put to work by private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also ancestors for Jonathan Borofsky's wildly imaginative, 
wonderfully poignant "Ballerina Clown," a cartoonish 30-foot-tall figure of an 
eye-popping performer. Since the moment it was erected in late 1989, the 
sculpture has been a landmark at the busy Venice intersection of Rose Avenue 
and Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioned independently by a private developer for the facade of a 
mixed-use building of shops, restaurants and upscale condominiums, Borofsky's 
magnificently idiosyncratic sculpture is nonetheless pointed in addressing the 
public realm. In fact, one source of its stunning significance is the way it 
speaks to the modern dilemma of public art itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ballerina Clown" is an image of the gentle soul who wants nothing more than 
to add some pleasure and beauty to the world but who is pitilessly being made a 
laughingstock. In these brutish times, sounds like an artist to me. 
</P>
<P>
 The brightly painted female figure of a ballet dancer in a fluffy tutu is 
perched on a soapbox high atop an architectural pedestal; it sports huge, 
oversize gloves and the big, bulb-nosed mask of a sentimental circus clown, 
whose hobo style recalls Emmett Kelly or Red Skelton. Behind the dancer 
balancing precariously on pointe, a spotlighted curtain provides a jaunty 
theatrical backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture is a modern version of the artist cast as clown or ignoble 
entertainer, subject to the volatile tastes of whatever forms of social and 
political power happen to hold sway. This image is at least as old as Watteau's 
18th-Century paintings of the melancholic mime, "Gilles," or Velazquez's 
pungent portraits of the dwarfs at the 17th-Century Spanish court. In the 
raucous circus of contemporary life, Borofsky's "Ballerina Clown" steps forward 
to take its place at center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture has received its share of rotten tomatoes from the passing 
audience too. A few neighbors -- who would likely have paid little attention if 
a Carpeteria genie had been put up on the block -- howled loudly when 
Borofsky's dancer was first erected. It has since become a distinctive 
landmark, although still the occasional target of dimwitted vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostility that some viewers feel toward Borofsky's sculpture is emblematic 
of the larger public suspicion toward modern art. But "Ballerina Clown" is 
brilliant precisely because it gives stunning visual form to the otherwise 
invisible social stresses and strains of art in our time. 
</P>
<P>
 Borofsky lays out the artist's modern dilemma in all its playful tawdriness 
and hopeful pathos. His sculpture is an unlikely civic symbol for the 
estrangement between artists and audiences, both of whom are bound by deeply 
human desire and equally human failing.

'Unity' 
</P>
<P>
 Komar and Melamid 
</P>
<P>
 I n the bureaucratic labyrinths of city government, peculiar ideas regularly 
get hatched. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most outlandish was an option provided to major L.A. developers, 
who are required by city ordinance to commit a percentage of their building 
costs to public art. A developer, if he or she wishes, can exercise the option 
to choose the project and the artist to execute it, without any participation 
whatever by representatives of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a Postmodern variant of aristocratic noblesse oblige, in which a 
corporate oligarchy is required to behave nobly toward the huddled masses. It 
has brought us lots of tired stuff, including an actual dime-store knickknack 
blown up to monumental scale (in Little Tokyo) and a sculptural metaphor for a 
skyscraper's high-tech air-conditioning system (near the financial district). 
</P>
<P>
 One magnificent exception proves the general looniness of the rule. That's 
because the artists, Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid, have an unusually good 
grasp of the internal workings of political bureaucracy, power relationships 
and glorious, civic-minded odes to The People. 
</P>
<P>
 Emigres from the Soviet Union well over a decade before its collapse, they 
were steeped from a young age in the officious, pictorial rhetoric of social 
uplift demanded by their government. They know how to turn it on its head. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ground floor of downtown's First Interstate World Center, Komar and 
Melamid's painted 1993 relief-mural "Unity" is a beautifully executed, wildly 
funny satire on that rhetoric's hardy American cousin. Its subject is the 
predicament of multiculturalism in a capitalist economy, as packaged for 
consumption by the public. If Americans of every moralistic stripe seem 
convinced that the only good art is art that is good for you, then it follows 
that corporate interests will champion only art that seems good for business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unity" is a big, undulating triptych whose form is extrapolated from 
13th-Century paintings of angels found in the Porciuncula Chapel near Assisi, 
Italy -- the church from which Los Angeles takes its name. The triptych centers 
on an exuberant relief of a skyward-gazing angel, who is rendered with a 
vaguely bathetic demeanor. The androgyne has the moony look of saintliness 
typical of Baroque paintings by Guido Reni. 
</P>
<P>
 The chromatic lushness of the symbol-laden figure is reminiscent of a Russian 
icon. It's cloaked in exquisitely articulated symbols: a red-and-yellow 
Buddhist banner, a golden halo borrowed from pre-Columbian images of an Aztec 
deity and a mahogany headpiece derived from Nigerian masks. 
</P>
<P>
 The angel's spreading silver wings are poised to whisk the celestial creature 
heavenward, much as the bank of elevators in the lobby below stands ready to 
send you up, up, up -- to the ethereal realms of the skyscraper's 73rd floor. 
These grand wings claim a rather different source than the angel's other 
assorted parts, one that is considerably closer to home: They're copied exactly 
from the wings of an American eagle, as depicted on the back of an ordinary 
quarter directly beneath the motto E pluribus unum . 
</P>
<P>
 In "Unity," Komar and Melamid have managed a double-edged achievement, at once 
celebratory and sobering. While the beauty of the relief-mural pays aesthetic 
tribute to a multicultural mingling of Euro-, African-, Latino- and 
Asian-American cultures, the idealized image of social harmony is finally being 
driven by, and subject to, the commercial prerogatives of business. At the base 
of the tallest bank building in town, "Unity" nimbly clarifies the context 
within which so much social dialogue today takes place. 
</P>

'The Poetry Garden' 
</P>
<P>
 Siah Armajani 
</P>
<P>
 Neither a painting nor a sculp ture, "The Poetry Garden" (1992) is instead a 
functional environment designed as an inviting outdoor room in which visitors 
can sit and talk and read. 
</P>
<P>
 The garden, privately commissioned for an existing 50-foot-by-70-foot 
courtyard adjacent to the offices and galleries of the Lannan Foundation, was 
intended as a kind of vest-pocket park open to the public in an otherwise bleak 
light-industrial neighborhood near Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran-born, Minnesota-based American artist Siah Armajani created a place that 
aspires to be a living metaphor of nothing less than the democratic ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 It works. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its dazzling array of simple yet elegant elements, "The Poetry Garden" 
deftly merges a host of conflicting forms: Shaker-style benches of golden-hued 
wood slatted like the clapboards of an old New England house; a 
garden-within-a-garden reminiscent of Persian miniatures; a dramatic, 
monumental gateway whose style recalls early-20th-Century Russian 
Constructivist plans for public information kiosks; a double row of 
anthropomorphic ceramic jars stacked suggestively one atop another, lip to lip; 
the hand-hewn enclosure of a Spanish Mission-style courtyard; ecologically 
sound plants, capped by a magnificent California live oak, appropriate to its 
semi-arid desert setting, and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots more. 
</P>
<P>
 Two inspirations seem pivotal to the design. One is "The Anecdote of the Jar," 
a poem by American poet Wallace Stevens, which the artist prominently printed 
on ceramic tiles above the backs of the benches. The other is the general 
layout of a classical Islamic paradise-garden, which Armajani knew from 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stevens poem addresses the relationship between nature and culture. 
Through the magical metaphor of a jar placed in the wilderness of Tennessee, 
the civilizing function of art is deftly asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 An Islamic paradise-garden, enclosed by high walls and carefully planted 
according to custom, is meant as a refreshing sanctuary from the brutal desert 
environment beyond its fortifications. The connection between this ancient 
Middle Eastern form and Stevens' ode to a ceramic jar taking dominion over the 
American wilderness links two disparate cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, of course, the two cultures shared by an Iranian immigrant to 
America. Armajani explores and memorializes his own history in "The Poetry 
Garden," but he does so in ways that subsume the merely personal into a larger 
celebration of democratic principle, in which all can share. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There are other noteworthy examples of public art in town, such as the 
Otterness sculptural ensemble at the Roybal Building and a magnificent pair of 
maps -- one of the Pacific Rim, the other of starry constellations -- in an 
expansive terrazzo floor designed by Alexis Smith at the new Los Angeles 
Convention Center. The artists responsible for all these remarkable projects 
have made works in which the social background and physical environment of art 
-- its context -- have been profoundly engaged. That engagement is key to their 
exceptional level of accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's worth emphasizing that considerations of context do not stop at the 
physical, geographic, social, political, historical or any other academically 
researchable condition of the site. For the context of any work of art, public 
or otherwise, is profoundly shaped by our assumptions about art itself. 
</P>
<P>
 These stellar examples of public art distinguish themselves -- in no small way 
-- by boring deeply into the conventional subjects, functions and expectations 
we hold for art and for artists, and for their relationship to the social 
realm. Discovering what art itself might be is the most basic job description 
for any artist who means to be a citizen of the world, which is what public art 
demands.*

 "A mountain of soul -- woo-woo" ("Learn, Baby, Learn," by Magnificent Montague 
with Bob Baker, Sept. 25). That jingo has stayed in my head for 25 years. Many 
thanks.

<P>
 By all means, Hubert Fauntleroy Julian deserves a place of prominence in 
Magnificent Montague's museum -- but in the rogues' gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian was a flimflammer and scam artist his entire life. His colonelcy was 
self-commissioned, as was his lieutenancy in 1923. He made a career out of 
promoting funds for flights to Africa that never came off, and he turned to the 
international arms trade when transatlantic flying became passe. Hardly a role 
model. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian was never a competent pilot, despite having had the best instructors, 
and most of his aerial escapades ended in spectacular crashes. He ground-looped 
on landing when he took his private-pilot's test in July, 1931, nearly crashing 
through a barn door. Several years later, during the coronation of Haile 
Selassie, Julian crashed again, while showing off in a borrowed Moth biplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian's claims to having raised and trained the Ethiopian Air Force are 
utterly without foundation. He never served Selassie but was denounced as a 
fraud and thrown out of Ethiopia in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 His schemes did nothing but line his own pockets. The 10 (Bellanca Airbus) 
ambulances he tried to foist on the Finns were never even built, and there is 
no evidence that he held a bona fide commission in anyone's armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Montague needs to pass on the charlatans and glorify the real heroes. If he 
needs a black prince of aviation, let it be the likes of Eugene Bullard of the 
Lafayette Escadrille, Capt. William J. Faulkner Jr., who flew 56 World War II 
missions before he was killed, or Gen. Ben Davis Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 John Underwood 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Montague replies: Julian was a rogue -- variously a soldier of fortune, stunt 
pilot, diplomat, rum runner, bodyguard, foreign correspondent and mercenary. My 
collection documents historical figures, not all of whom are role models. The 
article was written to express the excitement with which I pursue both the 
glory and the foibles of my people.  
</P>
<P>
 Julian lived in an era during which it was nearly impossible for black people 
to achieve and contribute. Yet, despite segregation, he strutted across the 
stage of the white man's country and soared to become the man he wanted to be. 
His many imperfections do not change that.

IN LOVE WITH LIVING THINGS; NATURALIST, BY EDWARD O. WILSON (ISLAND PRESS: 
$24.95; 352 PP.) ; JOURNEY TO THE ANTS: A STORY OF SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION, BY 
BERT HOLLDOBLER AND EDWARD O. WILSON (HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $24.95; 224

<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Weiner, Jonathan Weiner's latest book, The Beak of the Finch: A 
Story of Evolution in Our Time,is the 1994 winner of the Los Angeles Times Book 
Prize for Science. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "If you're a storyteller," the filmmaker Howard Hawks is quoted in 
"Naturalist," "find a good story and tell it." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 40 years, Edward O. Wilson, one of the preeminent evolutionary 
biologists of our time, has been finding and telling good stories in unlikely 
places, from fire ants in Alabama, to bulldog ants in Western Australia, to 
army ants in Costa Rica. ("Most children have a bug period," he says, "and I 
never grew out of mine.") His discoveries have excited other biologists and 
intrigued a widening circle of readers (most of whom outgrew their bug periods 
a long time ago). In four decades at Harvard University, he has won the 
National Medal of Science and two Pulitzer prizes (for "On Human Nature" in 
1979, and "The Ants" in 1990). Now, in a wonderful new memoir, "Naturalist," he 
tells the story of his own evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "My childhood was blessed," Wilson writes in the book's prelude; but not 
everyone would say so. Wilson was born in Birmingham, Ala., in 1929. His 
parents divorced when he was 7, and he grew up in a series of homes and 
Southern boardinghouses, dependent on the kindness of strangers and the whims 
of his father, an alcoholic government accountant. By the time he graduated 
from high school, he had attended more than a dozen different public schools 
and one military academy. Then is father killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 As a boy, he was shy, small, "always the runt of my class." In town after town 
he headed for the woods and swamps. There he collected ants, rattlesnakes, 
butterflies, Spanish moss. "Animals and plants I could count on; human 
relationships were more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 "Strong father, weak son," Wilson writes; "weak father, strong son; either 
way, pain drives the son up or down in life." Pain drove Ed Wilson upward. 
Early on, he discovered an amazing capacity for hard labor. By the age of 13, 
he had become "a child workaholic," delivering 420 newspapers every dawn in 
Mobile. At the same time he began climbing toward Eagle Scout, and expanding 
the long woods-and-swamps adventures that would make him one of the great 
explorer-naturalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The year of his parents' divorce, he blinded his right eye in a fishing 
accident. His left eye happened to be unusually sharp at close range, and that 
helped push him toward entomology, toward "animals that can be picked up 
between thumb and forefinger and brought close for inspection." At 16, he 
resolved to choose a group of insects on which he could become a world 
authority. He considered flies: "I liked their clean looks, acrobatics, and 
insouciant manner." But to collect flies he needed long black pins that were 
made only in Czechoslovakia, and that country was not manufacturing any insect 
pins in 1945. Then Wilson thought of ants. "Of course, ants: my old 
acquaintances, the source of some of my earliest passions." 
</P>
<P>
 Very few scientists have written so candidly and evocatively about their early 
lives, and shown us how the career grew out of the childhood. And very few have 
the skill to make their work as clear and interesting as Wilson does here. In 
the second half of the book, he leads the reader on adventures in rain forests, 
deserts, mountains and South Pacific islands -- wherever ants are to be found, 
which is almost everywhere. He gives us telling descriptions of many well-known 
figures in modern biology, including Richard Lewontin, Stephen Jay Gould and 
James Watson, the cocky young co-discover of the double helix, who joined 
Harvard in 1956, the same year as Wilson, and became Wilson's nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson felt that the future of the life sciences lay at the level of 
molecules. The study of living animals and plants was history. Ecology was 
bunk. Thanks partly to Watson's agitations, the Harvard biology department, 
like biology departments almost everywhere, soon stopped looking for people 
like Wilson and began looking for people like Watson. This made life for a 
world authority on ants very uncomfortable, as Wilson describes in one of his 
memoir's liveliest chapters, "The Molecular Wars." He found Watson "the most 
unpleasant human being I had ever met." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, pain drove Wilson upward. He amassed an encyclopedic knowledge of the 
world's ants, finding and naming new species everywhere. He also made himself a 
master at finding and naming new theories. He explains these clearly and 
gracefully in "Naturalist," and in another new book, "Journey to the Ants," 
written with longtime collaborator Bert Holldobler. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about ten thousand trillion ants on the planet at this moment. The 
secret of their world-wide success, as Wilson and Holldobler explain, is their 
highly social existence: "It would appear that socialism really works under 
some circumstances. Karl Marx just had the wrong species." "Journey to the 
Ants" is a pocket version of the authors' masterpiece, "The Ants," and it does 
its job well. It is short, instantly accessible, and every chapter is packed 
with stories to make a reader gape. Some of these insects seem to be 
storytellers themselves; weaver ants "come very close to employing syntax in 
their chemical language -- the use of various combinations of chemical 'words' 
to transmit different 'phrases.' " Together weaver ants manage to do what a 
single ant could never do: roll up big leaves to make their nests. "Journey to 
the Ants" describes this feat in fascinating detail, and concludes: "The 
formula is one of simple repetition: work begets success begets added work 
begets still more success." That's Wilson! That's also science. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1960s, "fueled by the amphetamine of ambition," Wilson began 
looking for rules that explain why working together pays: why social behavior 
evolved and how it got locked into the genes of so many species. In 1971, in 
his monumental book "Insect Societies," he made the case for the bugs. In 1975, 
in his even more monumental "Sociobiology: The New Synthesis" he made the case 
for all social creatures -- including us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sociobiology" infuriated many readers. The opposition was led by Lewontin and 
Gould -- again, right in Wilson's own department. Wilson tells the story of the 
controversy with the same grace and poise with which he tells the more painful 
stories of his childhood. "I have been blessed with brilliant enemies," he 
writes. Some of them saw sociobiology as a throwback to racism and eugenics, 
which it is not. Others saw it as an attempt to subsume the humanities and 
social sciences into branches of biology. It is not really that, either, but 
Wilson did sometimes write in as threatening a style as Watson, so that at 
least a few of his new enemies were earned. There were placards, bullhorns, 
protests in Harvard Square and an ambush with a bucket of ice-water. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again pain drove him upward, to champion a cause that everyone of the 
warring factions could believe in -- conservation. No one has worked more 
passionately and effectively to conserve what has lately come to be called 
biodiversity. Wilson estimates that we are now losing half a percent of the 
species in the world's rain forests each year. "This," as he has written in a 
much-quoted essay, "is the folly our descendants are least likely to forgive 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 "When the century began," Wilson writes, "people could still easily think of 
themselves as transcendent beings, dark angels confined to Earth awaiting 
redemption by either soul or intellect." Now we see ourselves as part of 
nature. Again, when this century began, we still saw ourselves as conquerors of 
nature; now we see ourselves as trying to preserve nature, and ourselves within 
it. In both these changes in human thought, Wilson has played an important 
role, and that is what makes the story of his life an important story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturalist" is a pleasure to read and reread, which is the mark of 
literature. It is one of the finest scientific memoirs ever written, by one of 
the finest scientists writing today. And "Journey to the Ants" should turn many 
readers into fans of its authors' favorite chunk of biodiversity, a group of 
living things that are at once weird and familiar. Among the new words that 
Wilson has coined in his long career is "biophilia": love of living things. 
Both these books should foster biophilia.

 If you're looking to the tube for new and classic All Hallows' Eve tales to 
curl your toes and warm your spirits, you'll have a lot to choose from by the 
time you're ready to put on a happy or scary face. 
</P>
<P>
 First off, there's a real trick: At press time, CBS had opted not to air its 
popular and perennial "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown." But we've got 
the treat: You can find Linus in the pumpkin patch on video (for $13 from 
Peanuts Home Video). 
</P>
<P>
 Among the grab-bag of programs airing, there are some other tempting Halloween 
morsels: Disney's dark "Gargoyles" premieres on the Disney Channel, Ray 
Bradbury's award-winning "The Halloween Tree" will be rebroadcast by TBS (it's 
also available on video) and, for those who prefer cute over scary, ABC will 
rebroadcast "Double, Double Toil and Trouble," starring the irrepressible Olsen 
twins of "Full House." 
</P>
<P>
 For the more mature and nostalgic set, Bravo will present the cerebrally

SOAPS; DAY GLOW; CBS MARKS A HALF-CENTURY OF SOAP OPERAS WITH A REUNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the dress rehearsal for the CBS special "50 Years of Soaps: An All-Star 
Celebration," two-time Daytime Emmy winner Peter Bergman was hopping from empty 
table to empty table, looking at the seating assignments marked with photos of 
the soap stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went around saying, 'Oh, so-and-so's going to be here! I haven't seen her 
for years,' " recounts John C. Moffitt, the show's executive producer-director. 
The excited Bergman ("The Young and the Restless") was "like a kid," Moffitt 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 That excitement and sense of reunion are exactly what Moffitt and fellow 
executive producers Pat Tourk Lee and Bruce Nash hope to convey to viewers 
watching the two-hour special Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Taped in August on a Hollywood sound stage, the show brings together past and 
present cast members of all 10 current daytime dramas, as well as performers 
from serials long gone by. The show aims to be a glitzy but thoughtful salute 
to what may still be television's least respected medium. Fifty-two daytime 
stars appear on stage, with another 100 or so in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Clips selected for the special highlight memorable moments in daytime romance, 
the stormy and poignant relations between family members, soaps' depictions of 
social issues, the heinous doings of vixens and villains, humorous vignettes, 
turning points in plots and, yes, the influence of soaps worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 There are tributes to William J. Bell Sr., Agnes Nixon and the late Irna 
Phillips, creators of nine of the soaps on the air today, and short speeches by 
viewer favorites Eileen Fulton, Bill and Susan Seaforth Hayes, A Martinez, Kim 
Zimmer and Victoria Wyndham. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of soapdom's dynamic duos are reunited here, including Mary Stuart and 
Larry Haines of "Search for Tomorrow," which went off the air after 25 years in 
1986; Jonathan Frid and Lara Parker of the 1966-1971 "Dark Shadows" vampire 
soap, and Jacqueline Courtney and George Reinholt of NBC's still-airing 
"Another World." 
</P>
<P>
 The finale features a fashion show of 10 actresses in their characters' lavish 
wedding gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to present an event that (the daytime community) would feel proud 
of," says Moffitt, whose other credits with Lee include "Comic Relief," ABC's 
"40 Years of Television" and HBO's 20th anniversary show. "It's sort of like an 
awards show without the awards -- we're honoring people for their contributions 
and showing great scenes, as much as we could." 
</P>
<P>
 Footage from soaps was rarely preserved before the 1970s. Research staff 
culled clips from the production companies and networks, the Chicago Museum of 
Radio and Television, fans, collectors and the daytime actors, directors and 
writers themselves. Their earliest find was a 1954 clip from "Love of Life." 
"It was a real detective story," Moffitt says. 
</P>
<P>
 The sleuthing off. "I was very skeptical, because no one consulted me about 
anything -- we had some people here who don't know our shows, and they were 
making a lot of choices," says Bell, co-creator of CBS' "The Young and the 
Restless" and "The Bold and the Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 "But they surprised me. They did their homework. And they did what rarely, if 
ever, has happened before: There was real dignity given to our product, with no 
potshots or cheap shots that made us look a little dumb." 
</P>
<P>
 The actors, too, had "a blast," in the words of A Martinez, who zoomed to 
stardom as Cruz Castillo of "Santa Barbara," which is now off the air. "I got 
to see a whole bunch of people I hadn't seen for a long time. They asked me to 
pick my favorite scene from 'Santa Barbara,' and it was a treat -- I got to 
time-travel back through the past. And I loved watching (other performers') 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 One of them was Helen Wagner, who has played matriarch Nancy Hughes on CBS' 
"As the World Turns" since its 1956 premiere. "People had to board red-eyes to 
get back to New York," she says of her fellow attendees. "But instead of 
wanting it to be over, they left reluctantly." 
</P>
<P>
 The retrospective even drew the participation and praise of Anthony Geary of 
ABC's "General Hospital," who is known for his dislike of publicity and other 
trappings of soap celebrityhood. "It was relatively painless, so on my scale it 
was a pretty good evening," he says with a laugh. "I expected to be bored to 
tears, but it was an amazingly pleasant experience. I like to be involved with 
something that presents the medium for its work, not its cosmetics or 
pectorals." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the viewers, Moffitt believes that the show will appeal even to those 
who are not already soap fans. "We wanted the clips to be self-sustaining, so 
that you didn't have to know the back story," he says. "You can see the talent 
of the actors and the writers. So for those who don't now watch, I hope they'll 
say, 'I'm missing out on something. I'm going to tune in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "50 Years of Soaps: An All-Star Celebration" airs Thursday at 8 p.m. on CBS.

'GARGOYLES' TAKE WING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to folklore, gargoyles are stone statues by day, fearsome winged 
creatures by night. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's Disney's version, put forth in a new series called Gargoyles, that 
takes mythology one step further: Gargoyles (the "good" ones) are nocturnal 
crime fighters against the barbarians of modern Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as production on another dark and dramatic series -- Warner Bros.' 
"Batman" -- has gone to slumber, Disney was planning this week's premiere of 
its first dramatic animated series. It will be introduced in a five-part 
miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's shaded enough for adults, but there's a lot of action for kids," says 
Michael Reaves, the series' head writer and a story editor. 
</P>
<P>
 Series development director Greg Wiseman credits his interest in gargoyles -- 
as well as some previous in-house development -- as the catalysts for the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The statues, he points out, were originally carved to ward off evil. "I asked 
that question and we let our imaginations go and we wound up with this show," 
he says. "Gargoyles" draws on myth -- some of which, he acknowledges, is made 
up here. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead gargoyle Goliath (voice of Keith David) "defines a lot for the show, 
making it more dramatic. The show is still humorous, but has more drama than 
any of our other (animated) shows. Goliath's behavior, his world view, really 
defines the show. Goliath, he adds, represents a perpetually optimistic 
viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a very good, sophisticated comic book," describes Reaves, who 
also adds that the relationship between the "good" gargoyles is one of loyal 
friendship. "At its core, it's about good triumphing over evil," says Reaves, 
"but throughout the gargoyles are always aware of how much they need each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 The five-part miniseries "Gargoyles" premieres this week, Monday-Friday, at 4 
p.m. on KCAL. Beginning Nov. 4, it will air at 4 p.m. Fridays . N.F. MENDOZA

 WORLD ORDERS OLD AND NEW by Noam Chomsky (Columbia University Press; 311 pp.). 
It's an interesting question: If Adam Smith were alive today, would he pat Noam 
Chomsky on the back or challenge him to a duel? Chomsky, professor of 
linguistics at MIT but best known for his shrill, radical politics, would bet 
on the former: he alludes to Smith a number of times in "World Orders Old and 
New," usually referring to Smith's view (found in "The Wealth of Nations") that 
the rich and mighty follow the "vile maximum" of "All for ourselves, and 
nothing for other people." Smith has come to be regarded as a champion of 
capitalism for his "invisible hand" theory of the marketplace, but in fact the 
great Scottish philosopher was wary of laissez-faire economics: He knew the 
system would not serve public interests unless powerful men were prevented from 
creating monopolies and controlling governments. Today, Smith would be shocked 
at the extent to which the affluent and powerful have managed to side-step 
market forces, and Chomsky, as always, is more than happy to chronicle their 
sins. He may cite facts selectively, and with a needlessly scornful tone, but 
in the final analysis "World Orders Old and New" -- based on lectures Chomsky 
gave at the American University in Cairo last year -- makes many points 
substantiating Smith's fears. His main points are two: that "The Cold War 
provided pretexts, not reasons" for U.S. policy over the last 40 years, and 
that the end of the Cold War has enabled the U.S. government to achieve its 
ultimate goal -- "to set the terms of discussion" for virtually any issue, and 
thus become the ultimate empire.Chomsky must be read with many grains of salt, 
in order to neutralize the sort of ideological biases he criticizes so 
vehemently in others, but the overall thesis of this book rings frighteningly 
true.

 THE ANTI-EGOTIST: Kingsley Amis, Man of Letters by Paul Fussell (Oxford 
University Press: $22; 224 pp.). It must have struck the publisher as a 
marvelous pairing -- independent, forthright, wide-ranging, witty, often 
cantankerous writer Paul Fussell commenting on independent, forthright, 
wide-ranging, witty, often cantankerous writer Kingsley Amis.Alas, it was a 
mistake: Fussell is not only a friend of Amis, but too much like him, it 
appears, to be able to produce anything more than a sycophantic portrait. One 
problem with "The Anti-Egotist" makes itself known in the first paragraph, when 
Fussell notes that he has left to one side Amis' best-known work, his fiction, 
in order to concentrate on his criticism and poetry. A second appears more 
gradually, when Fussell makes clear that he plans to argue that "Sir Kingsley," 
as Amis is occasionally referred to in this book, is a "moralist" of the old 
school. Fussell, author of such first-rate nonfiction as "The Great War" and 
"Modern Memory and Wartime," makes his case to a certain extent . . . and then 
proceeds to demolish it by attempting to incorporate within that moral 
framework Amis' views on the proper way to host a cocktail party, his years as 
a restaurant critic, and some intemperate screeds against the modern and 
post-modern (such as Amis' notorious essay "Sod the Public: A Consumer's 
Guide"). Fussell responds within the book to a few of Amis' critics, among them 
Saul Bellow, but the rejoinders are usually lame -- an indication that Fussell, 
like Amis, would rather dismiss severe criticism than understand it. Neither 
Fussell's nor Amis' reputation will be enhanced by this volume.

 THE SOUL OF POLITICS by Jim Wallis (The New Press/Orbis Books: $19.95; 275 
pp.). The many-hued spiritual revival occurring in the U.S. today -- 
fundamentalist, prophetic, evangelical, feminist, New Age, etc.-- has many 
politicians quaking in their boots. They should be quaking: modern politicos 
are largely responsible for this rekindled interest in religion, having failed 
to produce an effective, encompassing vision for the nation and the world at 
large. Jim Wallis, a religious and political activist based in Washington -- 
whom Cornel West, in a brief preface, calls "the major prophetic evangelical 
Christian in the country" -- in this book lays out his vision for a more 
spiritually oriented politics, and if he says little that's new, Wallis does 
draw attention to important, ongoing social problems. At bottom Wallis is 
concerned with selfishness: the ways in which the powerful reflexively dominate 
the less powerful, however one chooses to define power -- in terms of wealth, 
gender, education, skin color, ad infinitum. "The Soul of Politics" isn't a 
call to arms but a plea for repentance, in its biblical sense of "turning 
around," and reads at times as if Wallis has seen into the heart of things. 
When he writes that "we can find common ground only by moving to higher 
ground," or that "the problem is not that the young people haven't learned our 
values; it's that they have," you can practically hear his parishioners say, in 
unison, "Amen."

 OEDIPUS AT FENWAY PARK: What Rights Are and Why There Are Any by Lloyd L. 
Weinreb (Harvard University Press: $29.95; 221 pp.). Books about rights, as 
Harvard Law School professor Lloyd Weinreb notes in his introduction to this 
volume, appear with almost appalling frequency these days. One reason is that 
rights are so hard to define: one person's right is another person's wrong, 
just as the right to swing one's arm is limited by a neighboring nose. Weinreb 
argues, in a nutshell, that rights are intrinsic to the human lot, having 
emerged from age-old community traditions, and are directly and inextricably 
linked to social concepts of responsibility (a word, oddly, on which he spends 
little time). Weinreb swims in murky water here -- so murky, indeed, that he 
may well disagree with the paraphrasing above -- but it's pretty clear he sees 
the idea of "rights" as man's way of attempting to account for the fact that 
life at times seems self-determined, at others predetermined. That's "Oedipus 
at Fenway Park": If the Theban king was predestined to be a parricide, despite 
his exceptional abilities and apparent free will, then couldn't a lousy but 
resourceful pitcher tell the Red Sox manager he has just as much right to take 
the mound as Roger Clemens? Weinreb's theory is a stretch, and dense 
philosophical language renders it inaccessible much of the time, but Oedipus at 
Fenway Park does highlight nicely the question of just desserts. Salieri would 
understand the problem, even if it eluded Mozart.

 THE VOICE OF FREE EARTH by Michael Klein (One Horse Rhino: $19.95; 287 pp.). 
Fiction by first-time writers, by and large, is heavily autobiographical, and 
Michael Klein's "The Voice of Free Earth" is no different.Indeed, judging from 
this book's acknowledgments and appendices, Klein has hardly disguised his life 
story at all -- and that's frightening, for the father in this work is an 
inexplicable brute. He drives around his rural neighborhood at night shooting 
cats with hollow-pointed bullets; he mounts a machine gun on his bomb shelter 
in anticipation of nuclear-winterized neighbors; he beats his son for wearing a 
red vest to a high-school football game; he terrifies his wife and children to 
such an extent that they welcome his purchase of a Porsche, so loud it provides 
them extra time to prepare for his arrival home. The father, what's more, is a 
doctor -- Doc Beale, the sole physician in the San Joaquin Valley town of Free 
Earth, and much respected by local citizens for his long hours, loyalty and 
disdain for money-grubbing colleagues. Klein, who works in advertising in San 
Francisco, plays off the dark private side of Doc Beale against his laudable 
public life, but it's plain the impetus for writing this book is less literary 
ambition than the need to unburden; Klein most certainly is Christopher, the 
son who suffers terribly from Doc Beale's temper but finds pockets of joy in 
childhood nonetheless. Klein displays a simple but distinctive voice in "The 
Voice of Free Earth," the first volume (apparently self-published) of a 
projected trilogy, and given the stories he has to tell, shows a surprising 
generosity as well.

 I'm confused. A maharajah has torn down his palace and a steamer is scheduled 
for demolition. Yet the wooden remnants of both are saved and restored to a 
place of honor within a Hollywood restaurant ("Out of the Blues," Style, Aug. 
14).A reader objects (Letters, Sept. 11) and views this as "pilfering 
artifacts." The obvious alternative to saving these pieces would have been to 
reduce them to kindling. Would that have been a more acceptable outcome? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a religious exclusivist, who believes that because Buddha and Ganesh are 
represented within the same establishment, the place somehow becomes an affront 
to two of the world's religions (Letters, Sept. 11). He questions whether 
Christ or the Virgin Mary would be treated in such a manner. In fact, an 
exquisite statue of the Virgin Mary is right up on top of the stage, surrounded 
by other symbols representing many of the world's major religions. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign above says it all: "Unity in Diversity . . . All Is One." Certainly 
that is an attitude each of us must embrace if we are to solve the many 
problems facing our world today. The only divisions we have are those we have 
created in our minds.

 LOST OPPORTUNITY: Why Economic Reforms in Russia Have Not Worked by Marshall 
I. Goldman (W. W. Norton: $22.50; 290 pp.). If there's one major conclusion to 
be drawn from Marshall Goldman's fifth book on the Soviet Union, "Lost 
Opportunity," it's the near-impossibility of introducing economic and political 
reforms at the same time.Think about it: once you've opened up the democratic 
floodgates with political glasnost, how are you going to impose the crucial 
economic perestroika? Goldman, associate director of the Russian Research 
Center at Harvard, doesn't frame his argument in such rudimentary terms, but 
makes clear that Mikhail Gorbachev's failure to reform the U.S.S.R. 
successfully stemmed in large part from his inability to settle on a single, 
steady economic strategy: in 1990 alone he considered and abandoned eight 
economic plans, his flightiness no doubt influenced by the din arising from the 
long-stilled, often divisively nationalistic voices his political reforms had 
unleashed. Gorbachev comes in for hard but sympathetic criticism in this book, 
as does his successor Boris Yeltsin, though the latter receives points for 
maintaining, most of the time, a relatively steady hand on the fiscal tiller. 
Yeltsin, unlike Gorbachev, was quick to put his communist past behind him and 
accept the "shock therapy" proposed by young economist Yegor Gaidor (later to 
become Russia's acting prime minister), though the reform, as it turned out, 
proved too little, too late. Such basic change might have worked years earlier, 
but Goldman explains in detail why it probably would have failed even then, 
mainly due to the Soviet Union's inbred resistance to Western economic 
structures.

 From "Junkets on a Sad Planet: Scenes From the Life of John Keats" by Tom 
Clark (Black Sparrow Press: $13.00 paper, $25.00 cloth; 180 pp.) 1994. 
Reprinted by permission.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tom Clark's cycle of poems tell the whole story of John Keats' life. Keats was 
known only to tiny literary circles in England when he died at 25 in 1821 in 
Rome. His fame, as we know it, was entirely posthumous. As the 19th Century 
wore on, Keats -- along with Byron and Shelley, who all died young -- generated 
legends that could be compared to the contemporary obssessions with James Dean, 
Marilyn Monroe or Elvis. By our time, they have been embraced by the "Academy"; 
they no longer represent the spirit of Romantic rebellion, but have become an 
integral part the literary Dead White Male liturgy revolted against today. 
Keats, Shelley and Byron are so ridiculously famous that they have lost their 
humanity. They are godly, remote icons, read at gunpoint by reluctant English 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Clark -- poet, biographer, critic -- has resurrected Keats as a mere man 
in "Junkets on a Sad Planet." A mere man, perhaps, but an immensely gifted one, 
a modern one, brilliant, moody and doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Burgess' novel about Keats, "ABBA," is weirdly beautiful; it is 
incredibly hard going as well. Not so Clark's evocation of Keats and his world. 
If anything, readers will be instantly reminded how seductive, sensual and 
inviting Keats's writing really is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Junkets" (the cockney nickname one of Keats's friends devised for him) 
sometimes lets us see things through Keats's eyes and mind, sometimes we watch 
him from a not too distant remove. Always the tragedy that was Keats's life 
breaks your heart. You can imagine yourself falling into step with the 
diminutive poet on a chilly winter evening in London as he "plowed through the 
crowd of street vendors hawking hot eels, hot pea soup and doubtful pies." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who loves Keats' poetry (and letters) will be stunned by Clark's 
"negative capability" to capture the essence of the poet's style and spirit in 
a minimum of elegant and haunting words. Georgia Jones-Davis

 In a fragile and unpredictable world, the 1990 blockbuster Ghost (CBS Sunday 
at 9 p.m.) struck a seductive chord: A lover (Patrick Swayze) from the 
afterlife hovers over his bloved (Demi Moore) to keep her from harm, trying to 
communicate the love he couldn't express for her in life. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 1987 cmedy Baby Boom (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.), director Charles Shyer 
and writer-producer Nancy Meyers have lots of fun sticking an adorable infant 
wit an avowedly single workaholic (Diane Keaton, in a dream part). Shyer and 
Meyers aren't afraid to be sophisticated and screwball, and they know just how 
far to exaggerate for laughs without leaving touch with reality entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching The Witches of Eastwick (KCOP Monday at 8 p.m.) is enough to make you 
believe that Jack Nicholson was born to play the devil, conjured up by Rhode 
Islander singles Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer. The curse of this 
1987 movie is that playwright Michael Cristofer's botched and bandaged script 
turns John Updike's novel inside out and upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot has been made of the fact that with 1990's Blue Steel (KTLA Tuesday at 8 
p.m.), director Kathryn Bigelow invaded the men's club of the bloody 
action-thriller. Ron Silver is the upscale psycho who gets slack-jawed when he 
sees a woman cop (Jamie Lee Curtis, in a strong portrayal) who can kill with 
the cool he'd like to have. 
</P>
<P>
 In Midnight Run (KTLA Wednesday at 8 p.m.) Robert De Niro, as a hard-case 
bounty hunter, and Charles Grodin, as a soft-shelled embezzler, are the stars 
of this often murderously funny 1988 chase comedy, a kind of crime movie Odd 
Couple, a Laurel and Hardy on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Double, Double, Toil and Trouble (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a 1993 TV movie, 
a caldron of warm fuzzy fare about witches, spells and moonstones, strictly for 
little Halloweensters and fans of "Full House" twin phenoms Mary-Kate and 
Ashley Olsen, who try to save their parents from financial ruin; it features 
Cloris Leachman in a dual role. 
</P>
<P>
 For older audiences, there's the 1974 horror-classic The Texas Chainsaw 
Massacre (KCAL Saturday at 9 p.m.). And for the truly grown-up: KCET's 
Saturday-night double feature, the 1933 Blonde Bombshell (KCET Saturday at 9 
p.m.), with Jean Harlow in a wicked satire on Hollywood, and the 1931 Blonde 
Crazy (KCET Saturda at 10:35 p.m.), with James Cagney as a small-time crook 
taking on big-leaguer Louis Calhern.

 Hurray to "Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman's" new season of 
episodes (ABC).The writing is filled with action, suspense and romance. The 
scenes are done with beautiful visual effects, such as Superman flying in and 
out of buildings and zigzagging around buildings. Don't forget his X-ray 
vision, which is incredibly realistic. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher are, as 
usual, excellent in their roles. To everyone else on the Daily Planet, keep up 
the good work.

FOCUS; HALLMARK YARDS; CBS AIMS TO SCORE AGAINST FOX FOOTBALL WITH MORE FILMS 
TARGETED AT WOMEN

<P>
 If a Montana pass makes you think of a country road outside Butte and a tight 
end is what you hope to have after a year of step aerobics, then CBS wants you. 
</P>
<P>
 The network that lost football is taking a new tack on Sunday afternoons. 
Football fanatics are long gone, they figure, but there's still an audience to 
be had, an audience no one's ever really considered for that time period. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS asked itself, " 'What can we put in that (Sunday afternoon time slot) 
that's going to attract an audience,' " says Steve Warner, CBS senior vice 
president for program planning. What they realized, says Warner, was "nobody's 
really been programming to women." 
</P>
<P>
 Those hitherto bored, annoyed and untapped on Sunday afternoons are now first 
and foremost on the minds of CBS programming executives. So how is CBS 
addressing the needs of women, ages 25 to 54? 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that we wanted to do since we'd not been programming this 
day part with anything but football for 38 years was to try a bunch of 
different things," says Warner. "This gave us an opportunity to do that and not 
be pegged to one specific program situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The network kicked off its "Sunday Afternoon Showcase" with a series of 
Harlequin romance movies, garnering modest but respectable ratings in their 
first week out. Later in the season the "Showcase" will present CBS Sports' 
"Eye on Skating," which will feature world-class international figure-skating 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week CBS begins a series of films produced by Hallmark Entertainment, 
the same company that produces "Hallmark Hall of Fame" specials, programs that 
have brought CBS prime-time success. Running the gambit from comedy to 
thriller, these new Hallmark Entertainment films are all designed to appeal to 
an adult female audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all really well-told stories, with good casts and excellent 
auspices," says Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS hopes to capitalize on the Hallmark stamp. "I think the Hallmark name is 
obviously a very important name," says Warner. 'The Hallmark Hall of Fames' 
always do well. They do well for two reasons. One, they're really good 
pictures. And two, because they've sort of become a brand name and people 
expect that they're going to see a terrific product when they turn on a 
'Hallmark Hall of Fame.' These are not 'Hallmark Hall of Fames,' but I still 
think that the Hallmark name is incredibly important." 
</P>
<P>
 Executive producer Dick Welsh (who also produced the Emmy-winning "To Dance 
With the White Dog" and "Breathing Lessons") says Hallmark's approach to 
difficult subject matter is what distinguishes its productions from others. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will never be offended by the way anything is presented," says Welsh. "We 
don't go for shock just to attract people or stimulate a story. There are 
always other ways to say what has to be said. And we always concentrate on 
doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 But while these are Hallmark Entertainment productions, Welsh says it is 
unfair to compare them to the Hall of Fames. "We have much more to work with 
when we're doing a 'Hallmark Hall of Fame,' " he says. "The budgets are higher 
and the development time is longer and the shooting schedule is much longer." 
</P>
<P>
 For Welsh and Hallmark, the "Sunday Afternoon Showcase" presents an 
opportunity for experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people out there who want all kinds of entertainment and they're 
entitled to have it," says Welsh. "We're real happy because we're doing 
different kinds of movies. I hope it works because I'm always interested in 
providing material for all kinds of audiences." 
</P>
<P>
 But will women be watching? "We don't expect women as a monolithic group to 
come and turn to this," says CBS' Warner. "But what we're looking for is to get 
a good core audience. We're approaching this gingerly and we'll see how we do. 
We're not trying to set ourselves up for failure."

COMMENTARY; FILLING 'HIATUS' HOLES LEFT BY SHOWS WE HARDLY KNEW (A FEW CREATIVE

 Here we are a few mere weeks into the fall season and the brand-new Fox shows 
"Fortune Hunter" and "Wild Oats" are only a memory. 
</P>
<P>
 And now with fellow newcomers "The Martin Short Show" and "McKenna" already 
put on what the TV world calls hiatus (a word that comes, fittingly, from the 
Latin hiare: to gape or gasp), gasping network programmers are scrambling to 
come up with new shows to fill the gaping holes in the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of them waiting in the wings: 
</P>
<P>
 * You may have noticed that no fewer than 16 returning series began the season 
in a new time period, in most cases on a new night. And they're still getting 
flipped around like burgers at a Dairy Queen.

 So don't miss "They Went Thatta Way and Thatta Way," a new game show that 
challenges contestants to find their favorite TV series using only their 
memories and deductive skills!  
</P>
<P>
 Everybody ready? Let's play the game! For five Nielsen rating points, do you 
know which night "Coach" switched to? Can you find "Frasier"? Do you have any 
idea which shows ABC swapped between Tuesdays and Wednesdays? 
</P>
<P>
 Please, no help from the audience. Any ideas? I'm sorry, the buzzer means 
you're out of time! 
</P>
<P>
 * This season, the only Thursday-night casualties aren't lying on gurneys at 
County General Memorial Hospital. No, the doctors of NBC's new hit "ER" have 
broken the cardinal rule of the medical profession, "Do no harm." 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't believe it, just consider the hurt "ER" puts on its rival shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, on the exciting "ER" spinoff "Thursday, Bloody Thursday," watch the other 
networks bandage up their schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch CBS' competing hospital drama "Chicago Hope" scramble to an earlier 
Thursday slot. Watch ABC's "PrimeTime Live" prepare to skedaddle to Wednesday 
nights. Watch CBS' "Eye to Eye," now opposite "ER," blinking back tears of 
fright. 
</P>
<P>
 There's lots of action, lots of suspence, lots of blood. But caution: Could be 
a bit gruesome for the kiddies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Instead, let them watch a new educational series, "National Geographic 
Presents Viewers in Flight." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fascinating look at the migratory patterns of puzzled TV watchers 
hunting for their local Fox affiliate, which used to be the local CBS station, 
that is, until it traded with NBC and the independent channel started carrying 
ABC shows, after which ... 
</P>
<P>
 * "Quitters Never Win ... Or Do They?" This new mystery will follow the 
fortunes of a certain redheaded overnight success as he ditches a certain 
police show to try to make it even bigger in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Will about-to-be-former "NYPD Blue" star David Caruso go far when he leaves 
the show in a few weeks? Or just far down? Tune in and see if, hey, he's still 
OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quitters Neer Win ... " will be hosted by McLean Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Unseamly Practices." With their so-called "seamless programming," the 
networks -- especially NBC -- have seized on the broadcast equivalent of run-on 
sentences which they think will help them keep their audience by sneaking past 
viewers a program's closing credits on a split screen with the stars goofing 
off or asking trivia questions then sliding right into the next show without a 
commercial interruption since after all you're just a bunch of chuckleheads and 
suggestible enough that without commercials to break the spell you'll sit and 
watch the same channel till Kingdom Come won't you? 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, there's "Stop the Music." In an updated version of the 1950s quiz 
show, contestants look on sadly while ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert 
trims or eliminates altogether the theme songs and fancy opening-credit 
sequences from his network's lineup of shows. It's all an effort to lop off 
precious seconds and keep restless viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 But who wins this game? That's unclear.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; RUDYARD KIPLING TAKES ON NEW 
MEANING THANKS TO GLOVER AND NICHOLSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Storytelling becomes performance art for kids when Danny Glover and Jack 
Nicholson get their hands on a couple of Rudyard Kipling tales, as shown on PBS 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The special Celebrate Storytelling ... With Danny Glover, airing in prime 
time, explores the nature of storytelling and demonstrates several methods in 
which a story can be told -- through dance, music and art. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbit Ears production company ("We All Have Tales," "American Heroes and 
Legends") is following its critically acclaimed versions of "The Velveteen 
Rabbit" and "The Ugly Duckling" with Kipling and two of Hollywood's hot actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson loans his sardonic wit as he narrates "How the Rhinoceros Got His 
Skin" and "How the Camel Got His Hump." Both tales are from Kipling's "Just So" 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Glover, who reads "How the Leopard Got His Spots" is joined by Ladysmith Black 
Mambazo and Batoto Yetu, New York-based children's troupes who perform dance 
versions of stories in segments between the tales that are read. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a show that children and adults can watch together," producer 
and Rabbit Ears founder Mark Sottnick says. "It's different than other shows, 
which simply read stories to kids, in that it uses a lot of different, less 
conventional ways." 
</P>
<P>
 While the ultimate goal of the show is to entertain, Sottnick says that he 
hopes viewers "become aware of storytelling as an art form." 
</P>
<P>
 "Celebrate Storytelling . . . With Danny Glover" airs Wednesday at 8 p.m. on 
KCETand 7 p.m. on KVCR. For ages 2 and up. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 One of two Nickelodeon shows premiering this week for preschoolers is 
Allegra's Window, which looks at life through the eyes of a 3-year-old living 
in a community of puppets. Each episode uses plot and song to tell a complete 
story from beginning to end, much like a "Broadway musical for kids," according 
to a Nick spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick hopes that Allegra will mirror the emotional ups and downs of its 
targeted audience. She'll be anxious about day care, saddened when she loses 
her favorite toy and will have a hard time keeping a secret. Allegra uses 
nature, imagination and resourcefulness to solve problems, make discoveries and 
learn new things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allegra's Window" premieres Monday at 11 a.m. on Nickelodeon. For ages 2 to 
6.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned: If you have a 2- to 6-year-old at home, tune into Gullah Gullah 
Island, a show about an African-American couple (Ron and Natalie Daises, 
married in real life) who open their home to preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not exactly a sitcom, but there's a storyline that runs through each 
show; it's not just a series of vignettes like other preschool programming," 
Natalie says. "It's a simple plot." 
</P>
<P>
 "We also incorporate a lot of music into it," adds Ron. "We don't talk down to 
them in any way and introduce them to all kinds of things. They'll hear 
calypso, Caribbean, Afro, pop, gospel and all the old standards, done in a way 
that preschoolers can relate to." 
</P>
<P>
 Each episode looks at the culture of the Sea Island region along the Carolina 
and Georgia coastlines, with a look at the communities their people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daises' real son Simeon plays the youngest of the TV family's children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gullah Gullah Island" premier e s Monday at 11:30 a.m. on Nickelodeon. For 
ages 2 to 6.

ON THE TOWN: WHOSE TRIAL IS IT ANYWAY?; JURORS IN THE SIMPSON CASE FACE A FEW 
TRIBULATIONS OF THEIR OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Patt Morrison 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Locked up except to go to court. Closely supervised family visits. Restricted 
reading matter. This isn't O.J. Simpson. It's his jury. 
</P>
<P>
 From the first gavel, the big jury question beyond "Did he or didn't he?" has 
been "To sequester or not sequester?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sequester ( si-kwes-ter ) v., from the Latin, meaning "to immure 12 strangers 
in a moderately expensive hotel at taxpayer expense until they agree on two 
matters: that the accused is either guilty or not guilty and that they never 
want to lay eyes on one another again." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there are people for whom six months in an L.A. hotel is the fulfilled 
dream of 10 lifetimes, but do we really want to import jurors from Bosnia? 
</P>
<P>
 Sequestration supposedly keeps jurors from being swayed by news coverage of 
the case on which they sit in judgment. In a 500-channel echo chamber 
backstopped by Internet gossip, that insulation is even harder to achieve now 
than it was a quarter-century ago, when the president of the United States 
pronounced Charles Manson guilty before the jury did. Bailiffs rubbed kitchen 
cleanser on the windows of the bus so that jurors wouldn't see the MANSON 
GUILTY, NIXON SAYS headlines on the way "home" to the Ambassador Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 For a simple evening of TV, let's say, these days a bailiff has to be in 
charge of the channel changer because even with a movie as innocuous as "It's a 
Wonderful Life" -- which is possible in a trial that will likely stretch beyond 
New Year's -- you never know when local news will sneak in a "FISTFIGHT OUTSIDE 
O.J. COURTROOM! FILM AT 11!" teaser.  
</P>
<P>
 And uncensored newspapers or magazines would be off-limits as well: no sports 
magazines ("Bills Pray for Former Teammate"), no true-crime journals ("Handguns 
or Knives as Murder Weapons? Death Row Denizens Debate") and no women's 
publications ("Battered Wives: How to Avoid Making Nicole Simpson's 911 Call.") 
</P>
<P>
 The Manson jury did take some excursions, however, to Disneyland and Palm 
Springs. After such enforced chumminess, I'd rather go to the laundromat than 
spend one instant hearing "It's a Small World (After All)" in the company of 
the only 11 people in the world I'm allowed to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with partial sequestration, I'd worry less about news "pollution" than 
about 12 people being driven around the bend, suffocating in some airless, 
hideously paneled courtroom every day for months, treated to the world's most 
able lawyerly histrionics and to a Sominex DNA seminar on RFLP testing, which 
until now I thought were the letters on my gear shift. And then, every night, 
they'd go "home" to a nice, warm mint on the hotel pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanksgiving? No carving-knife jokes, please. Christmas and Hanukkah? 
Mail-order gifts. Something special for the bailiff. New Year's Day? Watching 
the Rose Parade seems safe, but Trojan fans are out of luck when it comes to 
bowl games: You-know-who's name might come up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Manson jury was sequestered for 217 days. That's almost a whole year on 
the planet Venus. Almost a full-term pregnancy. Nearly a third as long as the 
siege of Leningrad and about a quarter as long as the Kennedy Administration. 
As long as summer in Needles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are less onerous sorts of sequestration -- shorter but maybe more 
intense for that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reginald Denny jurors were sequestered for only 15 days, and they knew one 
another only by number. Still, they argued and threatened and swore. One of 
them, a juror perturbed at being away from her boyfriend for the fortnight, 
reportedly ran down the hotel hallway, screaming, "I can't take it anymore!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Manson jury began and ended each day of deliberation with silent prayer. 
Before this trial is over, maybe this jury will be praying, too. For guidance. 
For a book deal. For a T-shirt slogan -- "Free the O.J. Twelve."

PALM LATITUDES: THE SCENE; MORNING BECOMES ATHLETIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Maria C. Iacobo 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan DallaBetta's unborn baby doesn't know me yet. But I know a few things 
about him. His name will be Joseph (Joey is his nickname) and his arrival will 
interrupt his mother's favorite part of the day: early mornings at the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that she's a fitness fanatic. For DallaBetta and me and probably 
thousands of others across Southern California, the gym, particularly in the 
mornings, has become a new town square or corner market. Our pre-dawn workouts 
are an opportunity to build up more than our bodies; they help us strengthen 
our social bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Every weekday morning, we grunt and sweat and chat, discussing discuss work, 
love, bad hair days, whatever. Though I know most of them only by their first 
name, we share advice and comfort. Some discussions have been deeply intimate 
-- I've learned about the best cream for sore nursing nipples and listened to 
one woman's anxiety over her mother's growing depression. Usually topics are 
far less serious: My movie trivia acumen has been challenged, my resume honed. 
</P>
<P>
 We're a dedicated bunch. "The people who are here in the morning are pretty 
religious," says DallaBetta. "If they're not here, you wonder what's happened. 
Are they sick? Did somebody die?" 
</P>
<P>
 John Walsh, director of the Getty Museum, says he gets a feeling "solidarity" 
among the morning crowd. "You see these people with their clothes off, eyes 
popping out, doing these clumsy things you wouldn't see them do any other 
time," says Walsh.  
</P>
<P>
 That might explain another morning phenomenon: We talk about our love lives, 
but no one comes here seeking to improve them. Says Steve Franklin of Encino, 
who stops here before starting his day as a CPA: "Nobody's really here for 
opposite-sex encounters, like they are in the evening," And that's fine with 
us. After all flirting here would be like flirting with family. Maria C. Iacobo

 MITSUAKI IWAGO'S KANGAROOS by Mitsuaki Iwago (Chronicle: $19.95; unpaginated). 
The only large animal that uses hopping as a means of locomotion, kangaroos 
resemble a malformed cross between a human and a rabbit.The noted Japanese 
wildlife photographer made several trips to Australia to document the red 
kangaroo, one of the larger species. Although most of these dramatic pictures 
appear to have been chosen for aesthetic qualities, rather than scientific 
content, they reveal the shifting moods of these oddly appealing marsupials.

 THE NAME OF THE ROSE by Umberto Eco, translated from the Italian by William 
Weaver (Harcourt, Brace: $10.95; 536 pp.). This new edition of Eco's brilliant 
murder mystery cum dialogue between Faith and Reason includes the Postscript, 
in which the author discusses its creation.With typical aplomb, Eco hops among 
references, from medieval romances and Dante's mystic rose to "Too Many Rings 
Around Rosie" from "No, No Nanette." In the 11 years that have elapsed since 
the English translation appeared, "Rose" has lost none of its appeal, and 
William of Baskerville's warning against fanatics sounds more timely than ever: 
"The Antichrist can be born from piety itself, from excessive love of God or 
the truth, as the heretic is born from the saint and the possessed from the 
seer. Fear prophets, Adso, and those prepared to die for the truth, for as a 
rule they make many others die with them, often before them, at times instead 
of them."

 MY WEEDS: A Gardener's Botany by Sara Stein (Houghton Mifflin: $11.95; 229 
pp., illustrated). The author of several gardening books, Stein notes wryly 
that gardens produce more weeds than anything else: "Weeds coerce my attention 
as tenaciously as a toddler hanging on my knees. They raise all kinds of 
questions, not the least of which is what are they doing in my garden in the 
first place." She explains how the weeds got into her garden in her 
entertaining accounts of common North American plant pests. Interweaving facts 
with stories about her own garden, Stein offers a tongue-in-cheek account that 
will strike a responsive chord in any frustrated gardener.

 RETURNING THE GIFT: Poetry and Prose From the First North American Native 
Writer's Festival edited by Joseph Bruchac (University of Arizona Press: 
$19.95; $45 cloth; 369 pp.) The essays, stories and poems in this collection 
grew out of a conference of more than 350 writers that took place at the 
University of Oklahoma in July, 1992.In his opening address, Chief Tom Porter 
(Akwesasne Mohawk) stated that by writing about their experiences, the authors 
were "returning the gift -- the gift of storytelling, culture, continuance -- 
to the people, the source from whence it had come." Most of the authors focus 
on ethnic concerns in works that range from the whimsical poem "Oh, Just Call 
Me an Indian" by Drew Hayden Taylor (Ojibway) to an anguished essay in which 
Duane Niatum (Klallam (Jamestown Band)) laments, "We have learned in our long 
battles with loss and denial and defeat that what is most difficult to face is 
not ourselves, but the pain of the ancestors in our dreams."

 HEART EARTH: A Memoir by Ivan Doig (Penguin: $8.95; 160 pp.) . Ivan Doig had 
only a few precious memories of his mother: She died of asthma on his 6th 
birthday. Working from a recently discovered cache of letters written to her 
brother in the U.S. Navy during World War II, the author of "This House of Sky" 
attempts to reconstruct her life. The investigations increase his understanding 
of his parents' loving marriage and their curious ties to the harsh rangeland 
of Montana: "But earth and heart don't have much of a membrane between them. 
Sometimes decided on grounds as elusive as that single transposable h , this 
matter of siting ourselves. Of a place insisting itself to us."

 TALKATIVE MAN by R. K. Narayan (Penguin: $9.95; 123 pp.) and A TIGER FOR 
MALGUDI by R. K. Narayan (Penguin: $8.95; 152 pp.). In "Talkative Man," 
Narayan's deft prose reads like an entre nous confidence over coffee at the 
Boardless Hotel cafe -- exactly the way a minor journalist (and major gossip) 
would recount a juicy story. The arrival of the mysterious Dr. Rann to collect 
data for an important UN study throws the imaginary South Indian town of 
Malgudi into an uproar, and Talkative Man chronicles the rise and fall of the 
flamboyant humbug. "Tiger" is narrated by Raja, a former circus star whose 
consciousness has been raised by a holy ascetic. Narayan uses his feline 
character to poke fun at the foibles of humanity, much the way Kipling used 
Bagheera, the panther in "The Jungle Books."

 Like a zillion others, Seung Won Choi moved to Los Angeles in search of 
stardom. Unlike most of them, he wants to make it not in movies or TV or even 
theater, but in opera. 
</P>
<P>
 He got off to a fast start: Last year, Choi, a tenor, took first place in the 
western regionals of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, winning 
the right to compete in the national finals in New York. There, he was named 
one of 10 national winners, earning $10,000 and the opportunity to perform on 
the Met stage, where he sang Cilea's "Lamento di Federico" and "Che gelida 
manina" from Puccini's "La Boheme." Gail Robinson, executive director of the 
auditions, says Choi's voice has a "creamy, Italiante quality, with a natural 
ability to communicate the meaning of the music." 
</P>
<P>
 He also performed at Ronald Reagan's birthday party at the Kennedy Center in 
Washington last February, earning a thunderous ovation. Henry Kissinger told 
him he'd be the next Placido Domingo. Margaret Thatcher said she was "deeply 
moved" by his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi says he came to Los Angeles because (reason tk when writer gets hold of 
Choi). "Performing on the stage is still regarded as frivolous and not terribly 
masculine in Korea," he says. "Also, they are not helpful there when it comes 
to the physically handicapped. You have to pass a physical exam just to enter 
the university!" Stricken with polio at the age of 4, Choi walks with a 
pronounced limp. With the aid of a cane, he's had little difficulty performing 
in recitals and competitions around town. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's learning the ropes. "He's come a long way, not just vocally," says 
Rena Cohen, president of the Opera Buffs, a local support group for young 
singers. "Now he's much more matter-of-fact about dates and schedules, and he 
knows to ask how much he's going to be paid before he agrees to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he still calls Los Angeles home, Choi is now spending most of his time 
in New York -- he's studying at the Manhattan School of Music and while he's 
there he's picked up a few gigs, including a performance in Handel's "Messiah" 
at Lincoln Center in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I need is to develop stamina and establish a repertoire of roles," says 
Choi. "I'll do whatever it takes to become an opera singer," he says. "I'm not 
afraid of anything." Ross Anderson

 CULTURE OF COMPLAINT: A Passionate Look Into the Heart of America by Robert 
Hughes (Warner: $10.99; 210 pp.). These controversial discussions of 
multiculturalism, the role of art in society, the state of the arts in America 
and the demise of intellectual debate began as lectures at the New York Public 
Library.Hughes exposes the American cult of victimhood to the withering light 
of reason, lambasting artists whose output is notable only for its allegedly 
political and/or therapeutic content. He castigates neolithic conservatives and 
inept liberals for misrepresenting their beliefs and clouding public discourse 
with self-serving rhetoric. "Much mud has been stirred up by the linkage of 
multiculturalism with political correctness. This has turned what ought to be a 
generous recognition of cultural diversity into a worthless symbolic program, 
clogged with lumpen-radical jargon. Its offshoot is the rhetoric of cultural 
separatism." Although the concept has been sadly misrepresented, he argues that 
true multiculturalism enriches a civilization, as new voices deepen the 
appreciation of the traditional arts.

PAGE TO SCREEN; A HAPPIER ENDING

<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The Road to Wellville," author T. Coraghessan Boyle goes for the jugular, 
but he does so with fruit compote rather than a carving knife. The story is 
served up in turn-of-the-century Battle Creek, Mich., where the genuinely ill, 
the merely neurasthenic and the frankly bored converge on breakfast-cereal 
magnate John Harvey Kellog's famed sanitarium. In their quest for perfection, 
which has obvious parallels with today's health consciousness (is it a 
coincidence that Boyle lives in Southern California?), these people endure 
enemas, laughing exercises, lectures, sexual abstinence, electrotherapy and 
enough roughage to evacuate even the largest mammals. Boyle has great fun with 
the humorlessness of this enterprise, and he also has a keen appreciation for 
the opportunists who want to make a buck out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now "Wellville" is coming to the big screen. Directed by Alan Parker and 
starring Anthony Hopkins, Bridget Fonda, Matthew Broderick, John Cusack and 
Dana Carvey, it opens this Friday. Parker also doubles as the screenwriter, and 
he's quite proud of his fidelity to the book, although he's quick to point out 
that the dialogue is his. "You take the spirit of the book and the nature of 
the writing and I'm inspired to write lines like 'An erection is a flagpole on 
your grave' and 'Behind every fortune lurks the shadow of a lie,' " he says. 
"You're inspired by the writing rather than by the words themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker received the book in manuscript from his representatives, the Creative 
Artists Agency, which also reps Boyle. With book in hand, Parker then set about 
researching the period. Much of what Boyle wrote about is based on fact. Kellog 
did indeed exist, as did his sanitarium and the infernal machines and diets 
that tormented his patients. Consultation with Boyle, however, was not part of 
Parker's research. "I think Tom was quite happy not to be involved," Parker 
says. "As he said, he was happy cashing the check." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not quite. Boyle says he has all the money he needs, so he views movies 
like this as a promotional tool for his work -- especially when it's true to 
the work. "I was blown away with what Alan had done," Boyle says. "It's an 
homage to the book." 
</P>
<P>
 About the only significant change Parker made occurs at the end, when Kellog 
corners his rebellious adoptive son by a vat of nut butter. "T.C. Boyle always 
likes negative endings in these things," Parker says. "I thought the 
relationship had to be resolved." Other than that, Parker's tale is so in tune 
with the strangeness of the material that some audiences may have a hard time 
getting a handle on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very unusual film, that's for sure," Boyle says. "It's a very unusual 
book. It has the first romantic enema scene in literature -- and onscreen."

WELCOME TO THE UNREAL WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Luke Spencer finally has a job. Until recently on "General Hospital," Luke's 
pre-adolescent son, Lucky (Jonathan Jackson), was the only working member of 
his household. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers were left to wonder if Lucky's fledgling worm-farming business paid 
all the bills while his parents, Luke and Laura (Tony Geary and Genie Francis), 
selflessly fought for truth, justice and the American way. 
</P>
<P>
 This is hardly the only example of a soap playing with reality. On "The Young 
and the Restless," Drucilla (Victoria Rowell), a former street kid who somehow 
became a promising ballerina although she failed to practice, was repeatedly 
accepted back by her stern instructor with only a few reprimands. 
</P>
<P>
 And why is the town of Oakdale on "As the World Turns" a breeding ground for 
corporate management firms? Not only does Walsh Inc. and Montgomery Inc. (now 
merged) and Worldwide each vie for and win the same global accounts, they leave 
the big city firms to question how they did it. All the executives in these 
firms have worked for the competition so that who works where or has which 
account is just a blur. 
</P>
<P>
 To this show's credit, the police on "As the World Turns" are quite credible, 
shown performing their daily duties so often that the police station is almost 
a character instead of a set. 
</P>
<P>
 But on some of the soaps the job description for police commissioner should 
read "no experience needed." Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods) on "One Life to 
Live" had never been on the force, but having a fiancee who is a defense lawyer 
and whose ex-husband is the district attorney were enough to qualify him for 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on "General Hospital," ex-Port Charles police commissioners Robert and 
Anna Scorpio (the departed Tristan Rogers and Finola Hughes) and current 
commissioner Sean Donely (John Reilly) all have shady and sometimes criminal 
pasts. Ironically, when Port Charles had a commissioner who did come up through 
the ranks -- commish Burt Ramsey -- he turned out to be "Mr. Big," a crime 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young and Restless" has even created a new occupation. Brad Carlton (Don 
Diamont), who was a gardener before he became an executive, and Jack Abbott 
(Peter Bergman) both competed for the job of "heir apparent," used 
interchangeably with "right-hand man," to Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Newman 
even had legal documents drawn up to deal with this job's disposition in case 
of his death. Would heir apparent be preferable to vice president on a business 
card? We don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprising career changes are nothing new to soaps. Do we remember how the 
beautiful social climber and sometime executive Lucy Coe started out as a mousy 
librarian? Such flights of fancy are nothing new. Almost 20 years ago on 
"Somerset" the character of Julian Cannell started out as a concert pianist but 
was soon shifted into the career of newspaper editor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the show's writers weren't completely out of touch: They had Julian keep 
his journalism degree in his piano bench.

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: HEY, YOU COULD LOOK IT UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the looming specter of Back to School trauma hovering last month, I 
naturally felt more than the usual pressure to purchase a first dictionary for 
my 6-year-old son when I walked into my friend Joel's house and noticed that 
his 6-year-old daughter was already on her second , having graduated from "The 
Cat in the Hat Beginner Book Dictionary" to "Words for New Readers" in the 
blink of an eye. Was I being remiss? 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, says Bonnie Smith, an experienced bookseller in the children's 
book department at Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena. " Anytime they are doing any 
sort of writing and/or reading is a good time to purchase a first dictionary." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other tips, Smith recommends that parents look for large type for 
younger children because their "eyes are undeveloped" and to "look for words 
they'd be using for reading books" -- with the caution to "shoot for slightly 
above the child's level" so you don't have to run back in a year and buy a more 
advanced dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
 When I mock-played belligerent customer, demanding she pick a specific title " 
'cause I'm in a rush and I don't have time to shop," Smith recommended the 
"American Heritage First Dictionary" (Houghton Mifflin: $12.95), calling it 
"pretty good, very comprehensive and easy to access." 
</P>
<P>
 And, just to keep me nervous (and get even), she pointed out that publishers 
are starting to comes out with thesauruses for children at the third grade 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay MacDonald, one of the children's librarians at the Beverly Hills Library, 
recommends that parents do a little homework: "We suggest that they take the 
classic dictionaries we have here and pick five to seven words and look them up 
in each dictionary. The basic information is about the same: Look to see how 
clear the examples are, ease of use for the child and the like. The way the 
book is laid out, the examples given, may make a big difference for a child -- 
ESL kids usually need examples that use the word in a sentence, in context 
while others may need just description." 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Connor, coordinator of children's service at the Central Library in 
downtown Los Angeles, pointed out the difference between preschool picture 
dictionaries ("The Cat in the Hat Beginner Book Dictionary," "Good Morning 
Word"), whose "purpose is to help children make the association between printed 
words and actions and feelings," and "more authoritative works" for older 
children who are "reading already and need to feel a sense of accomplishment of 
looking something up." The preschool works tend to group words by category 
(animals, food, etc.) and are more fun as a lure to kids who are just dipping 
their toes in reading waters. 
</P>
<P>
 For my son's age group, Connor likes both the American Heritage volume and the 
"Macmillan Dictionary for Children" (Macmillan: $14.95), saying "both are good, 
both are well-regarded." She also would like parents to test-drive the 
dictionaries before buying, stressing that the books must be "attractive so 
that children kids feel invited to use them." 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating the next dictionary I'll be shopping for, Monica Holmes, co-owner 
of Hicklebee's children's bookstore in San Jose, says the staff recommends the 
"Macmillan Dictionary for Children" because it "seems to be the most legible 
for 8- to 12-year-olds, most kid-friendly" and it makes a good "first serious 
dictionary," with the added bonus of "neat things" in the back of the book like 
an atlas, a timeline of world history and flags from around the world. (She 
also thinks it is better for 8- to 11-year-olds, despite what the publisher 
says: "Sixth graders need something more intensive than this.") 
</P>
<P>
 And, like librarians MacDonald and Connor, Holmes thinks parents should do 
some sleuthing: "Open the dictionary and look for a definition with 
easy-to-pronounce words and understandable meanings." She'd also like to see a 
"good dictionary in paperback to make it just a little more available" for 
folks who can't afford to buy one (publishers, are you listening?). 
</P>
<P>
 I wound up buying "The Macmillan First Dictionary". It was a toss-up between 
that and the "American Heritage" volume: Both had lots of entries, supported by 
plenty of illustrations and photographs. I just liked the feel of it better, a 
not-so-subtle reminder that in book-buying -- heck, in most of life -- the 
subjective has as much clout as the objective.

PAULINE AS SCHOOLMARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Critiquing Pauline Kael's reviews culled from her New Yorker pieces is no easy 
task. David Ehrenstein is to be congratulated for his evenhanded dealing with 
the collection assembled in Kael's "For Keeps" (Book Review, Oct. 9). 
</P>
<P>
 I would add a codicil to his statement: "If she isn't rounding up a posse to 
fight off Oliver Stone and his band of pseudo-intellectual rustlers, then she's 
forming a citizens committee to run Robert Altman for sheriff. In fact, just 
about every Western archetype fits Pauline Kael -- except schoolmarm." 
</P>
<P>
 Very funny, but not quite true. There was something of a schoolmarm to her. 
Schoolmarm in the best sense of the word. Sometime in the early 1970s, Saturday 
Review film critic Arthur Knight taught a film course at USC. He frequently had 
guest lecturers, and I recall one evening when Pauline Kael and I addressed the 
class. She was wonderful, intelligent, witty, passionate. At the end of the 
lecture, Arthur opened it up to a Q&A session. As was always the case in these 
sessions, the inevitable query was: "How do you get into the motion picture 
business?" I can still recall Pauline gazing out at a sea of would-be 
filmmakers, pausing, then stating something of this nature: "I don't know what 
to tell you. The problem with most of you is that you don't read anymore." A 
long pause, and then her voice rising: "No one of your generation knows 
anything about literature. If you are going to be a filmmaker, you must also be 
a reader -- someone aware of literature." 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline, the schoolmarm, was correct. One need only to view today's films for 
the truth of her statement. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT B. RADNITZ, CULVER CITY 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Ehrenstein in his review of Pauline Kael's magnificent anthology failed 
to convey what an astonishing critic she was. Not only was she an excellent 
writer, but one of the great stylists this country has ever produced. Her use 
of the vernacular and her uncanny sociopolitical insight showed that criticism 
could be as much an art form as jazz. Her work can stand alongside that of 
Edmund Wilson and George Bernard Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrenstein is also wrong about her influence. By breaking through the old-boy, 
dispassionate style of reviewing, Kael altered the way criticism was practiced. 
Not only can you see her presence in numerous movie critics, but in the work of 
book, theater, music, dance, art and food reviewers. She was able to convey the 
way educated people talked about movies. And she wasn't afraid to deal with the 
medium's sensuality or her own feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrenstein says Kael never helped one movie earn a cent. Again, I believe him 
wrong. I would offer as just one example "Last Tango in Paris." I feel her 
review had a lot to do with the film's success. And, if Kael was so 
insignificant, why did movie ads frequently feature full reprints of her 
reviews? 
</P>
<P>
 With so much incredible material to deal with, it's unfortunate Ehrenstein 
decides to beat a dead horse about "Citizen Kane" and to nit-pick about "Shoah" 
(the important point is that Kael fought for weeks to have the original 
critique published despite intense conservative and liberal pressure to scuttle 
it). 
</P>
<P>
 Kael said a great critic could -- by understanding and feeling for the work, 
by passion -- excite people so they want to experience more of the art there 
is. She fulfilled this role superbly. 
</P>
<P>
 DAN O'NEILL, LOS ANGELES 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his paraphrase of Pauline Kael's statement -- to the effect that Herman 
Mankiewicz's secretary said Welles "wasn't around" when the first draft of 
"Citizen Kane" was written -- David Ehrenstein somewhat understates the case. 
</P>
<P>
 History records -- and Rita Alexander, the secretary in question, confirms -- 
that the script was written at the Campbells' Guest Ranch in Victorville, in 
San Bernardino County, during a time when Orson (except for one or two trips 
accompanied by John Houseman) was in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not know what Welles' secretary subsequently typed. I do know that no 
"Kane" script or section of script not written by Herman Mankiewicz exists nor 
is there any testimony that one ever existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion exists only because of the emergence, years later in the Cahiers du 
Cinema, of the auteur theory. I have no objection to Welles being annoited 
auteur of "Citizen Kane." After all, as Franco Zeffirelli tells us in his 
immortal "Romeo e Giulietta," "that which we call a rose by any other name 
would smell as sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 DON MANKIEWICZ, LA CRESCENTA. Editor's note: Don Mankiewicz is the son of 
Herman Mankiewicz.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Ehrenstein's review of Pauline Kael's "For Keeps" is so reductive and 
thoughtless as to be simply false. Specifically, it is false that Kael has 
"never added . . . a penny to a project's coffers"; many people see movies 
because of reviews. It is false that Kael's essay "Raising Kane" is an attack 
on Orson Welles; it celebrates his brilliance as a director but recalls the 
fact, often denied by Welles and his admirers, that the "Citizen Kane" script 
was mostly the work of Herman Mankiewicz. It is false to write that Kael has 
"expung(ed) her 'Shoah' review from the permanent record," as if this selection 
were meant to replace all her previous texts. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger error, however, is the description of Kael as uneasy with ambition 
and content with self-deprecating movie trash. In Kael's view, movies are so 
powerful and work on so many different levels that even a hackneyed one can 
genuinely move us. Yet she never loses sight of the heights filmmakers can 
reach when they explore that power rather than exploiting it. Her reviews are 
thrilling because they grasp the tension we all feel between our guilty urge to 
retreat to any movie house and our deeper desire to put some meaning into those 
two hours. Kael's understanding that mindless and great movies work with the 
same tools is too subtle for Ehrenstein, but it will make "For Keeps" a joy.

EXITING "DAYS OF OUR LIVES" 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans of Deborah Adair, who began playing Kate Roberts two years ago on "Days 
of Our Lives," probably won't like the news that she is leaving the show in 
February when her contract expires. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress stated in a press release that she has been very happy with her 
role and with working on "Days," and that moving on is a difficult choice for 
her to make. Personal as well as professional issues led to Adair's decision. 
There was no word on whether the role would be recast. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, after months of speculation, "Days of Our Lives" has signed actor 
Mark Valley to resurrect the role of Jack Deveraux. This will be Valley's first 
contract soap role, although he recently had been seen in the recurring role of 
Father Pete on "Another World." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Yorkers are used to strange happenings in the Big Apple, but when "One 
Life to Live" took over two sections of Central Park recently, the scene turned 
a few heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The show taped scenes for the wedding of Asa Buchanan (Phil Carey) and Alex 
Olanov Hesser (Tonja Walker) near the Bethesda Fountain/Terrace and the Central 
Park reservoir. Although it was a big event, the nuptials were not traditional. 
</P>
<P>
 The bride, Alex, made her grand entrance dressed as Cleopatra, complete with 
Egyptian garb, and a barge paddled by servants, who were also appropriately 
costumed. There was a lot of excitement in store for Alex when her former lover 
and henchman, Bulge (Burke Moses), and Buck (Christopher Murney), whom Alex 
used to make Asa jealous, acted out their revenge plot, which included nuns, 
kidnaping and ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also a dramatic rescue attempt on the part of the bridegroom, his 
sons Clint (Clint Ritchie) and Bo (Robert S. Woods) and grandson Cord (John 
Loprieno). The four former cowboys had a chance to demonstrate their equestrian 
talents when they galloped through the park on horseback hot on Alex's trail.

 A total of 14 "Oone Life to Live" regulars and more than 50 extras are 
featured in the location scenes, which are scheduled to air in early November 
barring preemptions.

STYLE: GARDENS; THE HARD STUFF; IT'S EASY TO PLANT A LYRICAL LANDSCAPE, BUT 
DESIGNERS SEE BEAUTY IN A GARDEN'S BUILT FORMS AS WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At first glance, the subject might seem about as dry as decomposed granite. 
Where's the poetry in a patio? Who cares what kind of stone goes into a pool 
deck, or whether a path's made out of dirt or rocks or even peanut shells? When 
Tennyson talked about the crannied wall, it was only to get to his real 
subject: the adorable, pluckable flower. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's face it. That flower would be nowhere without the wall. And Tennyson 
might never have found it without a proper path. Leave out the hardscape -- the 
term garden professionals give to a landscape's built elements -- and a 
garden's likely to be a sorry mess, a trackless wilderness. Without the 
whip-cracking of walls and walks and decks, not only do prize plants fall out 
of formation but space remains undefined and therefore unusable: So long 
lounging patio; goodby al fresco dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city like Los Angeles, terraces are what allow us to carve flat space out 
of sheared hills; walls hold back craggy canyons and screen out the neighboring 
populace; paths and steps link the various levels of our landscapes and connect 
up our gardens and houses. What's more, the pavement we install reduces 
planting area, maintenance and water use -- appealing dividends in our 
fast-paced, drought-conscious environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the 1950s, California landscape architect Thomas Church was 
unequivocal about the value of hardscape in the general scheme of life. He 
wrote: "Paving -- something hard and convenient underfoot -- has been man's 
concern ever since he came down out of the trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the merely practical, however, there's a way in which paving defines 
the quality of our connection to the earth. In his classic book, "Genius Loci," 
Norwegian architectural scholar Christian Norberg-Schulz recounts the 
experience of architect Gerhard Kallmann wandering his devastated childhood 
street in postwar Berlin: His family's house was gone, "and Mr. Kallmann felt 
somewhat lost. Then he suddenly recognized the typical pavement of their 
sidewalk: the floor on which he had played as a child. And he experienced a 
strong feeling of having returned home." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps there is poetry here after all. And a message for us in Southern 
California, where our own streets were recently piled high with quake rubble -- 
bricks and broken concrete -- literally the building blocks of our outdoor 
life. Most of this refuse was taken to landfills or ground up and recycled for 
highway construction. Maybe now as it disappears, and before we're back to 
absently walking our new driveways and burying garden walls in shrubbery, we 
should stop to appreciate the hard stuff and its role in binding us to the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of hardscape as a framework -- for outdoor space, for plants, for all 
the activities that go on in a garden. In some areas, it might shine forth as 
the star, as in the case of a beautiful reflecting pool or a back-yard gazebo. 
In others, it falls back: the picket fence that's smothered in wisteria, the 
brick path connecting the rose collection to the vegetable patch. 
</P>
<P>
 Always, hardscape should take its cue from the house, the style and lines of 
which it extends into the landscape. Amid shaggy plantings, an edge of wood or 
stone gives the eye a resting place. It also suggests an overarching, 
human-made order in which, to a degree, nature is shaped and subdued. 
</P>
<P>
 Church, an inspired pragmatist whose aim was to get people to live in their 
gardens, argued for simplicity in a landscape's built forms. "It may be the 
role of paving to remain calm," he suggested, "to be the common denominator and 
a foil for the excitement created by fences, steps, grass forms, brilliant 
flower combinations, foliage textures and distant views." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, history is full of landscapes remembered as much for their 
show-stealing stonework as for their greenery. Picture the pebbled courts and 
terraces of the Generalife palace in Granada. Or the formal gardens of the 
Italian Renaissance, replete with sculpture, grand stairways, pergolas and 
splashing waterways. In California, early 20th-Century residents of Montecito 
used Spanish, Islamic and Italian models to adorn their estates with fabulous 
rills and water walls, mosaic garden seats and walled, secluded courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even then, most Californians could only dream of garden living on 
such a scale. Today, given the small size of a typical landscape plot and the 
high cost of labor and materials, most of our hardscape decisions are very 
basic. We need steps -- but where exactly? How many? Made of what? We'd like a 
patio to eat on -- but how big? What kind? 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the economic factors, these decisions are shaped by considering the 
consequences of our choices. Nowhere is this more evident, says Santa Barbara 
landscape architect Isabelle Greene, than in the realm of water conservation. 
"The greatest hardscape trend I see now," she reports, "is the awareness of the 
need to use water wisely." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, when public concern about drought began to spread, 
clients of Greene and others in her field have requested less lawn and more 
extensive hardscape to substitute for greenery altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene herself is widely known for imaginative swaps of stones for plants. She 
has used river rock "streams" instead of groundcover to suggest flowing water 
in a dry landscape, and she designs beds in abstract shapes and fills some with 
massed succulents, others with dry-laid stone, to give the effect of a mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to take each situation, intuit its real essence and bring that essence 
out," says Greene. She cautions, though, against overreliance on hardscape to 
solve landscape problems: "In many cases, the land should be left alone. We 
need permeable, porous surfaces, and we'll be in trouble if we keep paving 
everything over." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, she often designs minimal decking around a pool, allowing the 
water to shine from a small lawn like a mirror of the sky. She mixes hardscape 
materials too, fashioning steppingstones from giant Santa Barbara boulders, 
stairs from railroad ties and decks from wood, tile or rock imbedded in 
concrete. In one design for a garden in the Hope Ranch area of Santa Barbara, 
such a mix of materials not only helped to stabilize a hillside but also 
blended with heathery plantings that echoed the brambly local chaparral. Even a 
long stairway, made of wood ties and linking a series of water gardens, rests 
lightly on the land, appearing to float downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Greene, Mark Rios, a Los Angeles architect of landscapes as well as 
buildings, sees a hardscape trend in people's growing sensitivity to the 
environment. "Our expectations have changed," he says. With land in short 
supply and space getting tighter, he sees L.A. "becoming more of an urbanized 
culture. We're finding more in less. Fifteen years ago, it might have taken a 
huge lawn to satisfy the need for meditation and contemplation that makes us 
garden. Today, you can take a 15-by-15-foot, walled, paved court, put one 
beautiful specimen plant in it and that's enough." 
</P>
<P>
 As gardens grow more minimal, paving often gets more elaborate -- or is at 
least more carefully chosen, both for practical and aesthetic reasons. Concrete 
has been a popular paving material for decades, but those concerned about water 
conservation might decide to make a patio floor with salvaged, broken concrete 
rather than a new slab. Impermeable to water, unbroken slab concrete results in 
runoff and waste. It is also, as Rios points out, hard underfoot and can be 
blinding in full sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Broken paving, interplanted with something fragrant such as chamomile or 
woolly thyme, changes the experience of a simple walk through the garden. So 
does gravel, which crunches pleasingly, diffuses light softly and also happens 
to be less expensive than poured concrete or asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of Rios' own projects, a walled, Mediterranean-style house that had 
been redesigned by L.A. architect Stephanos Polyzoides, Rios used gravel 
throughout to connect a variety of garden and outdoor living areas. Instead of 
designing a path that would run through a dining courtyard, a couple of shade 
gardens and a children's play yard, he created a continuous "floor" of crushed 
beige and pink desert stone that makes the small spaces seem larger and 
complements the warm stucco of the house. It also reduces planted area and sets 
off what greenery there is -- for example, the roses, herbs and bougainvillea 
that burst forth at the edges of the dining area. 
</P>
<P>
 While this garden may seem minimal enough for some observers, Rios concedes 
that there are others for whom any maintenance is too much. For them, hardscape 
offers an alternative to going without an outdoor retreat altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios created just such a retreat in the Hollywood Hills for a man who traveled 
almost constantly. When he was home, he was bothered by noise from the busy 
street on which his house sat. A study in hardscape detail, the walled court 
Rios designed features a copper fountain spilling water into a concrete 
channel, a walkway of Arizona flagstone and a field of construction gravel, 
with some eucalyptus trees and purple hop bush on the periphery. As Rios 
describes it: "It's a simple, modern, Zen-style garden with nothing in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone appreciates such spareness, nor does a garden with a 
lot of paving have to do without fluffy, conspicuous foliage. Arcadia landscape 
architect Raymond Hansen has designed a number of gardens in which extensive 
hardscape has done double duty retaining hillsides and creating living space, 
all amid lively, naturalistic planting. For Sheila and Gerald Mells of 
Brentwood's Kenter Canyon, Hansen's creative paving transformed an unusable 
slope into an entry courtyard, pool terrace and entertaining area that also 
holds up a hill. Hansen and his associate, Patricia Araiza, used concrete 
pavers seamed with grass to substitute for lawn and unify the garden spaces. 
For softness, they planted the slope informally -- in creeping star jasmine, 
kangaroo paw and lavender, with sycamores and Canary Island pines shutting out 
neighbors' homes and blending with nearby chaparral. The whole effect is of 
clean, simple space left slightly shaggy at the edges by design. 
</P>
<P>
 For those whose hankie-size Venice yards -- not to mention modest pocketbooks 
-- would be mismatched with the professionals' elegant manipulations of 
hardscape, there's always the slapdash exuberance of crazy paving. A 
time-honored practice, it is often used in cottage gardens and described 
skeptically by Russell Page in his book, "The Education of a Gardener." 
</P>
<P>
 An internationally known English garden designer, he attributed the method to 
"an uninformed taste for the picturesque . . . which drives even quite 
sophisticated amateurs to smash good paving slabs into fragments and, like 
Hansel and Gretel in the fairy tale, scatter trails of them across the garden." 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't have to be like that. Heidi Wianecki, a Pacific Palisades 
artist who also does interior and garden design work, calls herself "a trasher 
who makes junk out of junk." Far from starting with anything new or "good," 
Wianecki says she regularly drives local alleyways, on the lookout for 
discarded materials. 
</P>
<P>
 In just this way, Wianecki amassed enough material to create a street garden 
and a courtyard in front of her house, a terrace behind it and even a 32-foot 
staircase of railroad-tie steps inlaid with all manner of cracked tile, brick 
and crockery. "It's cheap and I can do it myself," she explains, adding that 
she appreciates the spontaneity of a random pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 With scented groundcovers and herbs interplanted among the courtyard tiles and 
bird-seeded gazanias sprouting along the staircase, Wianecki's paving job is 
even wilder than Page imagined. For Wianecki, though, "it's experiential. It 
helps my mind wander." 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of us, it's a lively model for finding and keeping -- for 
discovering new meaning among the ruins rather than throwing them away. 
Timeworn, blunt at the edges, nicked and scarred by long-gone feet and hands, 
Wianecki's crazy quilt could be what her own children recognize -- what brings 
them home -- as they stand on a corner in Los Angeles 50 years from now.

HERE'S THE BEEF; PERFECT STEAKS AND FRIES, AND A DARING PINOT NOIR -- ALL IN 
COWBOY COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Since discovering The Hitching Post, a roadside steakhouse that features an 
updated version of Santa Maria barbecue, I keep finding excuses to head for the 
burnished-gold hills north of Santa Barbara. Exit off Highway 101 at Highway 
246, in the direction of Solvang and the Santa Ynez Valley. About a mile down 
the road is a brown building with a plain-spoken sign: World's Best BBQ Steaks. 
The parking lot is full and the air is scented wood-smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 As we pile out of the car, a lean cowboy lopes to the door, spurs softly 
jangling. The entrance is papered in hundreds of overexposed Polaroids taken at 
birthdays and anniversaries, which are celebrated at The Hitching Post with a 
serenade of kazoos. To one side is the bar, where a few die-hard smokers 
congregate. On the other is the dining room, decorated simply with sprigged 
wallpaper and old photos of solemn cowpokes on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
 We grab the table right outside the kitchen, where we have a great view of the 
grill at work. The burly, mustachioed fellow in a safari hat and 
double-breasted chef's jacket is owner Frank Ostini. The pace is fast and 
furious as thick filets, serious sirloins, hefty T-bones, slabs of ribs, halved 
artichokes and fat mushrooms go on the heavy ironwork grill. Ostini uses the 
hot spots to his advantage, moving pieces of this intricate puzzle about in 
response to the ever-changing oak fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The printed menu is superfluous. You have only to choose your cut of steak -- 
and the size you think you can handle. (In 1952, when the Ostini family 
purchased their first steakhouse in Casmalia, just outside Santa Maria, steaks 
came in just one size: 20 ounces. Now they come in three sizes, down to 5 
ounces.) The meat is Midwestern corn-fed beef, and with the exception of the 
filet, all are certified Angus. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostini is a true cook at heart. Since he took over the Buellton restaurant in 
1986, he's expanded on the traditional menu of relish plate, shrimp cocktail or 
soup, salad, steak and fixings -- for one all-inclusive price. He's added more 
appetizers, some interesting specials, grilled fish and a slew of homemade 
desserts. Pastry chef Susan Knauss turns out some tempting stuff, such as 
lemon-almond pound cake with fresh blackberry sauce or the tall slab of black 
gingerbread, served warm with a dollop of whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 But while still honoring the style of the Casmalia restaurant, now run by his 
brothers Bill and Bob Ostini, Frank has introduced some contemporary cooking 
and turned this Hitching Post into a sort of foodies' cowboy steakhouse. Good 
simple food like this, made with quality ingredients and with care and 
attention, is becoming harder and harder to find. 
</P>
<P>
 We start with a big platter of mixed appetizers: beautiful charred quails; 
grilled artichokes, blackened at the edges and served with a deliciously smoky 
tomato and ancho chile mayonnaise, and glossy pasilla chiles stuffed with 
shrimp and molten cheese. I also managed to sneak in an order of the special 
mushrooms, grilled and then finished off in a Pinot Noir sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 When you order the thick filet cooked rare, instead of being charred on the 
outside and cold in the center, the buttery meat is cooked rare all the way 
through. I've never had such perfectly grilled meat, and regulars tell me 
Ostini and chef Bradley Lettau can do it every time. Another secret is the 
basting, which is part of the Santa Maria barbecue tradition. The mixture of 
oil and vinegar keeps the meat from drying out on the outside. And the 
seasoning salt, traditionally a mix of salt, pepper and garlic (mostly salt, 
says Frank) adds flavor. Ostini's version includes a little onion, three kinds 
of pepper and cuts down dramatically on the salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Right up there with the steaks is the pale, moist pork loin that is first 
cold-smoked, then marinated in vinegar and oil before it is grilled whole. The 
baby-back ribs are notable, too -- not a lick of barbeque sauce, just sweet 
meat with a haunting whiff of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 A good baked potato you can have any day, but not these fries. Firm Idaho 
russets (and at the end of the season, local spuds) are peeled and thick-cut, 
then blanched and cooked twice in beef fat. Not exactly fitness fare, but worth 
the occasional indulgence.  
</P>
<P>
 Though Frank grew up in the restaurant business, he didn't envision a career 
in it. But a stint after college as bartender at the Casmalia Hitching Post got 
him interested in wine, and that led to a desire to do something with food. In 
1979, he turned his hand to winemaking, eventually producing a house Pinot Noir 
for the restaurant, a skill he took with him when the family opened the 
Buellton Hitching Post. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers were a little suspicious at first, as most house wines are not 
exactly premium, nor was Pinot Noir particularly fashionable. But he fell in 
love with this difficult grape. Now, with partner Gray Hartley, he makes four 
different Pinot Noirs with grapes from six different Central Coast vineyards 
under the Hartley-Ostini label. The best is the 1991 from the Sanford & 
Benedict vineyards ($30). 
</P>
<P>
 These days he makes his wine at the same Santa Ynez Valley facility used by 
good friends Jim Clendennan of Au Bon Climat and Bob Lindquist of Qupe, both 
superstars of Central Coast winemaking. A constant stream of French winemakers 
come to visit, and they inevitably end up at The Hitching Post for a big cowboy 
steak. When Ostini went to the Loire Valley several years ago, one enthusiastic 
winemaker insisted Frank cook up some steaks in his new fireplace. He built a 
huge fire, then went off and left Ostini to cope with flames so ferocious they 
threatened to burn the house down. Good thing the winemaker had left his home 
in the hands of a master at the art of grilling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hitching Post, 406 East Highway 246, Buellton; (805) 688-0676. Open daily 
for dinner. Dinner for two, food only, $30-$70. Corkage $7.

been copied repeatedly ever since its release -- and is about to be remade by 
Hollywood. With Vera Clouzot and Simone Signoret (pictured from left) and Paul

CRITIC'S PICK: 'GROUNDHOG DAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kenneth Turan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This 1993 fairy tale may not be the funniest collaboration between Bill Murray 
and director Harold Ramis, but this gentle effort is easily the most endearing 
film of both men's careers thus far. Murray (pictured) stars as a Pittsburgh TV 
weatherman who is so self-involved that he's convinced he doesn't just report 
the weather, he creates it.He hates nothing more than having to journey to 
rural Punxsutawney once a year to participate in the unsophisticated 
shenanigans centering on whether a groundhog does or does not see his shadow. 
First-time writer Danny Rubin, who wrote the script with Ramis, wonders what 
would happen if this guy discovered he would be forced to relive Groundhog Day, 
not just once a year, but day after day, ad infinitum. With Andie MacDowell as 
his pleasant foil, Murray turns the film into a funny little Valentine (HBO 
Sunday at 6 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.; Thursday at 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.). Kenneth 
Turan

$50 GUIDE; 'MONSTER' SENDS R.E.M. SPIRALING TO TOP OF HEAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Just when it looked as if Nine Inch Nails' harrowing "The Downward Spiral" was 
clearly the album of the year, R.E.M. returns with "Monster," an exhilarating 
work that could capture year-end honors. The radical yet reassuring collection 
tops this edition of the guide -- a way to keep up with what's exciting in pop 
on a budget of $50 a month. September 
</P>

 M People, "Elegant Slumming" (Epic). When C+C Music Factory came out four 
years ago with the "Gonna Make You Sweat" album, the New York 
songwriting-production team appeared to be setting the tone for '90s dance 
music lite -- music that is bubbly and seductive, yet intelligently crafted. 
But this London-based trio has taken over the leadership. "Moving On Up" 
expresses female resolve as joyously as Gloria Gaynor's late '70s gem "I Will 
Survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Various artists, "Natural Born Killers" soundtrack (Nothing/Interscope). The 
music in this masterfully designed package is delivered by everybody from 
Leonard Cohen and Patsy Cline to Patti Smith and the Cowboy Junkies. The key 
vision here, however, is courtesy of producer Trent Reznor, who mixed music and 
dialogue from the film in a reflection on these restless, explosive times that 
is ultimately more unsettling than the film itself. The most riveting moment: 
Reznor's own "Burn."  
</P>
<P>
 R.E.M., "Monster" (Warner Bros.). Longtime R.E.M. fans may worry on first 
listening that the band has sacrificed too much of its trademark sound in 
adopting noticeably harder rock textures -- a feeling shared by many U2 fans 
upon hearing "Achtung Baby." But "Monster," like that 1991 album, gains 
authority and character on each listening. The themes focus mostly on 
obsession, but "Monster" stands chiefly as a celebration of rock 'n' roll's 
power to comfort, heal, amuse and provoke. October 
</P>
<P>
 Oasis, "Definitely Maybe" (Epic). In the strongest debut by a British band 
since the Stone Roses in 1989, the battling Gallagher brothers take us back to 
the glory days of '60s and '70 English rock. Oasis combines the 
guitar-dominated sounds and songwriting sensibilities of everyone from Mott the 
Hoople and the Sweet to T. Rex and the Sex Pistols. It's all woven into an 
irresistible toast to youthful enthusiasm and desire. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Phair, "Whip-Smart" (Matador). In just a few glorious minutes, Phair 
justifies all the acclaim she has been receiving. The revolutionary thing about 
the Chicago singer-songwriter is that the strongest weapon in her biting 
explorations of sexual politics isn't sonic assault or psychodrama desperation 
but wry intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 R.E.M., "Monster" (Warner Bros). If you want to follow the guide literally, 
pick up the Jesus & Mary Chain's mostly acoustic but still tense "Stoned & 
Dethroned." But if you want to do a good deed, give a copy of "Monster" to a 
friend. Ever since Kurt Cobain's suicide in April tore the heart out of 
contemporary rock, the scene has been looking for an album that reaches out 
with the kind of vitality and celebration that will let us begin removing the 
black armbands. This is it.*

<P>
 The most surprising thing about this 1992 film is that even after you make all 
the obvious allowances for how jokey and cloying it is, it still makes you 
laugh -- a lot. It's been heralded as a British "Big Chill," and that's not 
entirely accurate.What's more, Kenneth Branagh, who directed from a script by 
co-star Rita Rudner (left) and Martin Bregman, brings something theatrical to 
the mix. The film opens in 1982 with a bawdy, low-grade New Year's musical 
performed by a troupe of graduating collegians. Now, 10 years later, Peter 
(Stephen Fry) has invited his old classmates to his family's country estate for 
New Year's Eve. The weekend turns into another revue, only this time their 
personal lives are the substance of the show. With Emma Thompson (right) and 
Alphonsia Emmanuel (HBO Monday at 5:05 a.m.). Peter Rainer

 Tracy Lawrence, "I See It Now,"(**) Atlantic. Lawrence's committed vocals 
makes the humdrum songs on his third album sound better than they are.A duet 
with John Anderson on "Hillbilly With a Heartache" pushes his singing a notch 
higher yet. Imagine what that twangy, expressive voice might do with songs that 
actually mean something.

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three

 Karyn White, "Make Him Do Right,"(***) Warner Bros. White's fans can take 
heart:"Superwoman" wasn't a fluke.Back after a lengthy recording hiatus, the 
Minneapolis-based singer delivers on the promise she showed on that late-'80s 
hit. Particularly potent is "Hungah," a Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis production 
that neatly sums up this album's boldly assertive, '90s-woman stance.

Carpenters, rock music's intelligentsia 10 years from now are sure to embrace 
this impossibly un-hip Swedish pair and their kicky melodies, sublimely silly 
lyrics, stinging guitar and bald teen appeal.On their fourth album, Per Gessle 
and Marie Fredriksson have evolved not a whit, turning out more deliciously 
overwrought ballads, bubblegum and great almost-grunge.

THE CHARTS: HEAVY 'ROMANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Latin market, Mexican crooner Luis Miguel's "Segundo Romance" has been 
one of the most dominant albums of the year. It continues to rule both Latin 
charts--the Times' Southern California and the national. Gloria Estefan's "Mi 
Tierra" is another long-running Southern California Latin chart hit--No. 7. 
It's helped cement her position as the top female singer in the Latin market. 
But Estefan's new one, a collection of cover songs, is a pop album. If it 
debuts next week in the Top 10 on the pop chart as expected, she'll be one of 
the rare artists to ever have Top 10 albums on both the Latin and pop charts.

RECORD RACK: WHAT'S NEW, PUSSYCAT?; A TOM JONES FOR THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 TOM JONES, "The Lead and How to Swing It" ( Interscope )*** 
</P>
<P>
 In the '90s pantheon of second acts to American lives -- or in this case, 
Welsh American lives -- Tom Jones too, is back. And this time he's wailing his 
way into the "90210" set, not the 89109 (that is, Las Vegas) bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Wishful thinking? Not necessarily. His rock comeback album's first single, "If 
I Only Knew," starts off with an extended scream that's both bloodcurdling and, 
of course, sex personified. Vocally he's no pussycat, and Jones goes on to 
creditably sing the living hell out of every track; mother and daughter may be 
able to bond in a home panty-tossing party. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many producers don't quite spoil the broth, though the who's who of big 
names (Teddy Riley to Flood to Jeff Lynne to Youth, and more) makes for 
interestingly inconsistent results. A couple of ballads aim at maintaining 
oldster support, while conversely, Riley's tracks stretch contempo-casting in 
requiring Jones to sing about his "crib." But mostly he's a willing, able and 
appropriate vessel for reinvention, and a brassy tonic for the lately too-cool 
world of dance music.

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three

 THUG LIFE, Volume 1 ( Interscope )*** 
</P>
<P>
 Cruising the 'hood with Tupac Shakur, who is featured this time out with a new 
group called Thug Life, is different than with other gangsta rappers. Though 
his music has been blamed as a cause in the killing of two police officers, 
it's no reckless celebration of violence and sexism.More than his peers, Shakur 
humanizes the gangbangers, burrowing beneath the swagger and cold-blooded 
veneer, often tapping into a well of desperation and pain. Not that he makes 
them likable; they're just fully rounded characters, rather than merely 
cardboard killers. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem with the album is there's not enough Shakur. The rest of this 
new group -- which is named after words tattooed on his stomach and includes 
his older brother MoPreme -- isn't in his class of rappers, contributing to a 
distinctly uneven quality over a few cuts. Also, some of the beats don't really 
illuminate or complement the lyrics, and some songs are weighed down by too 
much lyrical repetition. 
</P>
<P>
 This album isn't as strong as his two solo efforts, but when it works -- as on 
"Pour Out a Little Liquor," "How Long Will They Mourn Me" and "Under Pressure" 
-- it's superb. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 GLORIA ESTEFAN, "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me" ( Epic )** 
</P>
<P>
 Karaoke, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 Estefan has collected some of yesteryear's most familiar hits and, for the 
most part, offers note-for-note versions of the originals.The album sounds more 
like an exuberant, talented fan lip-syncing in front of a mirror than an artist 
creating vibrant new works by redefining old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a couple of exceptions. Gerry & the Pacemakers' Merseybeat classic 
"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying" emerges as a pretty, spare lament 
showcasing Estefan's embracing vocals. She also successfully tames Neil 
Sedaka's chirpy "Breaking Up Is Hard to Do," coming closer to Sedaka's own '70s 
remake than to his early-'60s original. 
</P>
<P>
 But Estefan misses more opportunities than she seizes. "Everlasting Love" 
cries out to be sung as a ballad, and there's not much point in re-creating 
Blood, Sweat & Tears' horn-driven arrangement of the soul number "You've Made 
Me So Very Happy." Selections such as that underscore her biggest missed 
opportunity: the chance to bring recognition to some of the many great singles 
that inexplicably didn't hit the first time around. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 Scarface, "The Diary,"(***) Rap-A-Lot/Noo Trybe/Virgin. "The Diary" is just 
that, an aural journey through the mind of an ex-Houston street con -- a hard 
mind flooded with thoughts of funerals, tears, drugs and confusion.The 
23-year-old Geto Boys member, whose lyrical tautness on songs such as "I Seen a 
Man Die" is frighteningly powerful, stays unapologetically true to the real 
origins of gangsta rap, never once straying from his hellbent mission to toss

 Imagine a world "balanced so precariously its harmony could be shattered by a 
whisper" -- and imagine Martin Scorsese putting it on film. Just as Edith 
Wharton's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of New York high society in the 1870s 
surprises by its velvet-gloved power, Scorsese impresses by how masterfully he 
met the challenge of transference.His 1993 film (scripted by Jay Cocks) is a 
beautifully done adaptation of the novel, polished, elegant and completely 
cinematic. Daniel Day-Lewis plays a pillar of proper society who's engaged to 
the most eligible -- and most giggly -- young woman around (Winona Ryder, 
pictured). He takes the nature of the social order he is a part of for granted 
until his childhood friend (Michelle Pfeiffer) re-enters his life (HBO Saturday 
at 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

<TEXT>
<P>
 VICTORIA WILLIAMS, "Loose" ( Mammoth/Atlantic )**** 
</P>
<P>
 It may sound like trite hype to call Williams a national treasure, but why 
mince words over such a valuable talent? Her third and best album is filled 
with distinctive revelries in the many small joys and large awes she finds in 
life, feelings that apparently were only intensified by her battle with 
multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Those twin themes are explicit in versions of the standard "What a Wonderful 
World" and Spirit's "Nature's Way," the latter a duet with Soul Asylum's Dave 
Pirner.But they are given finer detail in Williams' own miniatures, filled with 
the kind of eccentric characters and peculiar insights that would be at home in 
a Eudora Welty story. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams brings equal depth and emotion to such daily ephemera as "Polish 
Those Shoes" as to the complex outcast character study "Crazy Mary" or the 
celebratory wake for a deceased friend "Happy to Have Known Pappy." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' curious, spritely delivery is that of a born storyteller. Producer 
Paul Fox wisely frames it in ecumenical Americana (with some typically Stephen 
Fosteresque arrangements by Van Dyke Parks), allowing Williams' playful 
dynamics to dictate the flow. And flow it does, a captivating hour with a free 
spirit who finds God in the smallest things and compelling stories in even the 
most seemingly insignificant people. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; THE 'SPARKLE' THAT HOLDS FOX'S 'PARTY OF FIVE' TOGETHER

<P>
 The casting of 12-year-old Lacey Chabert as "Party of Five's" violin prodigy 
didn't turn on her musical abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened because of what producers of the Fox show call Lacey's inner 
"sparkle." Viewers who've watched the Monday night series that critics have 
praised likely know what the producers are talking about. 
</P>

 "We looked all over the country to find someone to play" Claudia, the 
next-to-the-youngest in the Salinger family left without parents when both die 
in an accident, says Amy Lippman, co-executive producer.

 "It wasn't what she read (during her audition); her personality won us over," 
adds fellow producer, Chris Keyfer, from the office he shares with Lippman on 
the Sony lot in Culver City, where "Party" shoots. "She was given very 
complicated direction and just impressed us with how bright she is." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lippman says, "It's a strong sense of irony that she also plays violin," 
Keyfer quickly adds, "But we would have cast her anyway if she didn't play an 
instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 "She just had this sparkle ," says Lippman. 
</P>
<P>
 The sparkle was still there, as much as it could be, in a phone interview from 
the beachfront apartment Lacey shares with her mother and sister Wendy in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was little," she says of her "youth" in the South, "I loved to 
perform." 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 vacation in New York turned into two years in the Big Apple, where 
Lacey won the role of young Cosette in Broadway's "Les Miserables." 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved it!" she says of the stage. "I got to wear makeup and get a huge 
black eye every night and that was so fun. I got to get beaten up. I also had a 
solo song." 
</P>
<P>
 Musical talent runs in her family, Lacey emphasizes, pointing out that sister 
Wendy, 19, is also a singer. Other siblings, T.J., 10, and Chrissy, 16, live 
with her father, Tony, at the family's 20-acre farm in Purvis, Miss. Mom Julie 
says she's looking for a Los Angeles home so the whole family can be together 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey's confident Claudia helps keep her "Party of Five" together, and with 
much of her own family away, Lacey's found her TV family a warm experience. 
"Neve (Campbell, who plays her sister, Julia) is like a real sister to me." The 
producers find Campbell's and Lacey's striking resemblance "a great 
coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Scott Wolf, who plays her brother Bailey on the series, Lacey says 
dreamily, "I want to marry him." 
</P>
<P>
 But it'll be a long time before Lacey walks down the aisle. She's still 
enjoying her childhood. "I love to roller-blade and swim," she says. "And I 
love to play business. My agent gave me this huge phone with 21 lines and I 
play Agency, where I run this casting agency and travel agency. When I play my 
name is Ally Watson." When asked where the name came from, she says, "I was 
just playing around and saying names and that one came to me, so that's who I 
am when I play." 
</P>
<P>
 For her birthday, three days away from the interview, she wants "a cash 
register. It's $400 at Staples. It has all the buttons. The cash drawer pops 
out. I hope I get it." (She did.) 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her happiness on the set and with her mom and Wendy in Los Angeles, 
she still misses Purvis, where the family lives "way out in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it when the studio lets us off for four-day weekends. We've been going 
home like every three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as she enjoys her newfound fame -- she's beginning to be recognized at 
malls -- she says the future may be a different matter. "I hope I'll be doing 
this, but I don't know what'll happen when I get old. I like the challenge of 
acting different ways and being different characters. I want to do movies, but 
I don't know if I'll always feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Lacey's mother: "Sometimes it feels like she's a much older person in the 
body of a 12-year-old. But right now, she's sure having the time of her life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Party of Five" airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on Fox.

 MADONNA, "Bedtime Stories" ( Sire ) (** 1/2) 
</P>
<P>
 It's Darwinism above morality once more for Madonna: "I'll never be an angel / 
I'll never be a saint it's true / I'm too busy surviving," she croons as her 
banal opening credo. At least the erstwhile dominatrix isn't trying too overly 
hard to prove her saintlessness this time (with the exception of one cocky 
anti-apology, "Human Nature," her post-Letterman F-you to critics).Rather, here 
she returns to tender expressions of love and loneliness; yeah, the soft 
Madonna is back. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorn of the puerile shock value of "Erotica" or the showy versatility of 
"True Blue," "Bedtime Stories" immediately seems the least remarkable of all 
Madonna's albums. But it's not necessarily the least of them. Despite four 
producers (each new to her equation), it has a nice, consistently relaxed feel, 
its slow jams hip-hop-inflected but not as self-consciously as last time, none 
of the songs rising too needlessly above mid-tempo. 
</P>
<P>
 The one track produced by Babyface goes in for bathos, but Dallas Austin and 
Nellee Hooper draw better results. Best are Austin's "Don't Stop," an 
irresistible dance anthem that could have been on her first couple of albums 
but for the funkier production, and Hooper's cool, near-ambient title song 
(co-written by Hooper and Bjork). 
</P>
<P>
 Lyrically it's another story. It's hard to believe that such a great interview 
could pen such strings of non-ironic cliches ("My heart has always been a 
lonely hunter"?). Cole Porter she's not, but, you know, she's too busy 
surviving. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

RETRO; SINGING AUTRY'S PRAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Folks nowadays may think of Gene Autry as owner of the California Angels or a 
museum namesake, but he was Hollywood's first "singing cowboy" and one of 
Tinseltown's biggest movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry, 87, is the subject of a new documentary, "Gene Autry: Melody of the 
West," premiering Sunday on AMC during the cable network's Second Annual Film 
Preservation Festival. AMC also will air restored copies of Autry's only 
Technicolor films, "The Big Sombrero" and "The Strawberry Roan." 
</P>
<P>
 The one-hour documentary is narrated by country great Johnny Cash, who happens 
to be a huge Autry fan. Also featured are reflections from Autry; actress Ann 
Rutherford, who received her first on-screen kiss from Autry; actress Gail 
Davis, TV's "Annie Oakley"; stuntman-actor Richard Farnsworth; Dick Jones, 
Autry's frequent co-star; country legend Patsy Montana, and Autry's musical 
sidekicks, "The Cass County Boys" (Fred Martin and Jerry Scoggins). 
</P>
<P>
 Producer-director Len Morris hopes to "bring Autry back for audiences who did 
experience that popularity and enjoyed those films. We are also trying to 
introduce them to a new audience who wouldn't have had that experience. And we 
are trying to explain why he was so hugely popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Autry, whose career has spanned 60 years, was working as a telegraph operator 
at a railroad depot in Oklahoma when the great humorist Will Rogers heard him 
sing and encouraged him to give show biz a try. Autry began his career in 1928, 
performing cowboy songs on the radio. By 1931, he had his own show. Coming out 
to Los Angeles, he starred in Mascot Pictures' bizarre 1934 serial "Phantom 
Empire," Hollywood's first and only singing Western/sci-fi adventure. He made 
his feature debut the next year in 1935's "Tumblin' Tumbleweeds," 
</P>
<P>
 With his comic sidekick Smiley Burnette and his horse Champion, Autry made 94 
Westerns for Republic and Columbia Pictures and starred in the 1950-56 TV 
series "The Gene Autry Show." 
</P>
<P>
 He also made 635 recordings; he wrote or co-wrote more than 200. His records 
have sold more than 50 million copies, including the first certified gold 
record ("The Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine") recognizing sales of more than a 
million copies. And these days his Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum is a 
popular Los Angeles tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris believes audiences have loved Autry for many reasons. "I think it was 
the voice," he says. "It was not the first time a radio personality had made 
movies, but since cowboys were going to sing, it was going to help to have a 
real musician. People forget that Gene Autry is a musician of considerable 
gifts. He brought that and the popularity of his radio career and his 
recordings to the movies. Cowboys had sung before -- John Wayne even sang, but 
it was just beyond awful. Gene could sing." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, Morris says, there was Autry himself. "There was something 
boy-next-door, something very trustworthy, something very reassuring about him. 
He had principles that he stood up for. He wasn't cynical." 
</P>
<P>
 And audiences of all ages responded. "You've got to keep coming back to Gene 
Autry," Morris says. "As Gene Autry would say, 'If it were easy, everybody 
would be doing it.' Many other people tried to do it and only Roy Rogers 
succeeded. It comes down to the individual and how people sitting in their 
seats and buying tickets perceived him. They perceived Gene Autry as concerned 
-- concerned about them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene Autry: Melody of the West" premieres Sunday at 10:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. 
on AMC. "The Big Sombrero" airs Sunday at 7:30 a.m.; "The Strawberry Roan" airs 
Sunday at 9 a.m. MUSEUM IS THE 'FULFILLMENT OF MY DREAM' 
</P>
<P>
 Though Gene Autry was not available for an interview, he did respond by fax to 
several questions about his life and career. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you see as your legacy as a cowboy movie star? 
</P>
<P>
 For over 60 years, my 93 movies, 91 TV movies and 650 recordings and 16 years 
of the "Melody Ranch Radio Show" entertained several generations of kids and 
their parents. I deeply appreciate the loyalty of my fans and thank them from 
the bottom of my heart for their support all of these years. To give something 
back -- with the wonderful help of my wife, Jackie Autry, and Joanne Hale -- we 
built the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles' Griffith Park, 
which is an accredited historical and education museum showing the history of 
the American Western from the days of the Conquistadors to the modern cowboy, 
as well as Hollywood's history of Western movies. ... it is the fulfillment of 
my dream in leaving a legacy for my fans, young and old. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you feel about the resurgence of Western films on the Hollywood screen 
today? 
</P>
<P>
 The first "story" movie was the 1903 "The Great Train Robbery," a Western, and 
there have been Western movies ever since. The Western was the backbone of the 
film industry for 60 years, and in the late '30s and early '40s, as many as 200 
Westerns were produced in a year. It is logical that there would be a 
resurgence of the Western -- all it needed were some good ones like "Dances 
With Wolves," "Unforgiven," TV's "Lonesome Dove" and more. GENE AUTRY'S COWBOY 
CODE 
</P>
<P>
 A cowboy never takes unfair advantage -- even with an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 A cowboy never betrays a trust. 
</P>
<P>
 A cowboy always tells the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 A cowboy is kind to children, old folks and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 A cowboy is free from racial or religious prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
 A cowboy is helpful and, when anyone's in trouble, lends a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 A cowboy is a good worker. 
</P>
<P>
 A cowboy is clean in person, thought, word and deed. 
</P>
<P>
 A cowboy represents womanhood, parents and laws of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 A cowboy is a patriot.

ALBUM REVIEW

<TEXT>
<P>
 LAURIE ANDERSON, "Bright Red" ( Warner Bros. ) *** 
</P>
<P>
 As an impressionist of impressive lyrical accomplishment, Anderson has the 
uncommon ability to take a metaphor and stretch it so ridiculously far that 
it's no longer metaphor but vivid waking dream.And in this she is at her 
haunting best in several tracks on her first new album in nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speechless" takes off from an Annie Dillard wilderness anecdote, about a 
doomed weasel terminally latching onto a preying eagle's neck, to make a 
statement about fading love. "Night in Baghdad" most evocatively essays what 
could be overly obvious: beauty in destruction. "Love Among the Sailors," which 
imagines a black plague spreading into every port, is one of the most touching 
songs yet to be written about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many other miniatures here fall sketchily short of this greatness, 
dependent no doubt on her next live revue for fuller contextual effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, this is some of her most accessible work, with producer Brian Eno 
ditching a lot of the electronic filtering and putting Anderson's unmasked 
voice right up front in all its ageless spookiness, a voice that can speak-sing 
a song about the 12:00 blinking on your VCR and truly make it seem like the 
stopped sands of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

PULP DICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stanley Crouch's masterful "Pulp Friction" (Film Comment, Oct. 16) further 
validates the MacArthur Foundation's wisdom in acknowledging this world 
citizen's contributions to art and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 What begins as a literate and informative en carriere review of Quentin 
Tarantino's movies quickly becomes an enlightening essay in American social 
philosophy, superior in clarity and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch's analysis furthers our understanding of what he calls "ethnic 
complexity," the blurring and marbling of white and black. In the theater, the 
staccato assault of Tarantino's images often overwhelms our ability to process 
the images as ideas and comprehend why they are so powerful. Replaying on tape, 
stopping or slowing the camera, we can only hope to better observe how 
Tarantino crafts his images. It is Crouch who assembles and explains them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely does a work of criticism become, itself, a work of art -- moving from a 
secondary source to a primary source. Stanley Crouch has done this. 
</P>
<P>
 DAN FAUCHIER 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 
</P>
<P>
 Though I am second-to-none in my appreciation of Quentin Tarantino, I believe 
that Stanley Crouch has embarked on serious over-interpretation of the man's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though two characters remark that "something is rotten in Denmark," "True 
Romance" is not "an ingenious variation on 'Hamlet.' " Hamlet spends most of 
the play occupied with retribution for his father's murder; the play is a 
revenge tragedy. Clarence in "True Romance" spends most of the film trying to 
make a big score with the stolen dope; he is unaware of, or unconcerned with, 
his father's murder. The film is a caper farce. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino's work does not really function as coherent -- or even incoherent -- 
social commentary; it is the super-groovy triumph of style over content. As 
someone once remarked -- I think it was Rudy Ray Moore in "Dolemite" -- it is a 
tale told by an idiot savant, full of sound and fury, signifying 
who-knows-what. 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD A. CASEY 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Crouch's essay is at once a journalistic coup de force and a 
defecatory treatise of superb indicatory knowledgeability reminding of the 
energy of poetic brilliance that defined one aspect of British sonnets between 
the chaos of Francis Bacon and William Shakespeare.  
</P>
<P>
 Albeit certain grammatic ellipses were noticed, but this surely foists upon 
the editorialism staff of the L.A. Times rather in no way indicates a 
predilection for eloquent meaninglessness as cover under which pulp fiction 
emerges. Being a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship recipient is Crouch almost 
with intelligence, as is Quentin Tarantino. 
</P>
<P>
 We can all rest soundly and peace knowing that the future of American 
filmmaking is in capabilistic hands, as are its truly gifted reviewers.

DANZIG IN THE DARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The music on Danzig's albums, as well as most of leader Glenn Danzig's 
material with the Misfits, has been very enjoyable escapism, but when he 
expresses dismay that his band isn't considered a success by the media, I think 
he's taking himself a little too seriously ("He's No Walk in the Park," by 
Steve Hochman, Oct. 9). 
</P>
<P>
 The reason he isn't more widely publicized is probably because, in most of his 
recent lyrics and interviews, he doesn't have much to say beyond repeating the 
usual cliches about hating the world, being a vaguely mysterious rebel and 
getting hassled by the meanies.Who wants to hear that all the time? 
</P>
<P>
 If he wants to be better known, or lumped together with more well-respected 
rock performers, perhaps he should seek out some fresh messages instead of 
recycling the same old posturing on album after album.

 Charles Champlin is indeed a master. His interview with Robert Mitchum 
captured the essence of the actor and provided new insights into Mitchum's 
personality ("One Icon, Hard-Boiled," Oct. 2). 
</P>
<P>
 It is refreshing to read about a great guy and a real talent who is not 
wrapped up in his image -- a contrast to most of the so-called stars of today's 
film and TV productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the accompanying picture by Bob Carey was perfect.

 Although he did receive a supporting actor nomination for "The Story of G.I. 
Joe" (1945), it's a pity that Robert Mitchum has otherwise been ignored by the 
Motion Picture Academy, in spite of his memorable performances in "The Night of 
the Hunter," "The Sundowners," the original "Cape Fear," "Ryan's Daughter" and 
"Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last, his face-to-face encounter with a rat staring him down was the 
ultimate in naturalism, and pure Mitchum. He was and is one of a kind.

 Went out and rented "Pursued" right after reading your Mitchum piece. Mitchum 
can give Rhett Butler a run for his money; oh, my, how that man can move.

 Thank you for having someone around to let me know what I've been missing that 
is now available in the video stores. Even in small towns like mine.

LOW 'BLOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How can Jack Mathews do an article on John Travolta without mentioning "Blow 
Out," his breakthrough film ("He's a Hotshot Again," Oct. 9)? 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in between making "films exploiting pop culture trends" in the late 
'70s and early '80s, Travolta made "Blow Out" with Brian De Palma. I remember 
watching the film at the Avco in Westwood, and scene after scene the audience 
was applauding a remarkable film with Travolta making his mature film debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blow Out" should have propelled his career to Mars, to use Travolta's phrase, 
as "Pulp Fiction" is doing right now. Why he went on to do "Perfect" after 
"Blow Out" is beyond me.

PALME D'ERROR

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Oct. 2 you printed a For the Record correcting a reference to the number of 
American films that have won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Reader Steve Barr, who pointed out your error, should have checked his facts. 
He neglected to mention that Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" won at 
Cannes in 1979.

<P>
 Who is he to correct anybody?

 The list of winners we published, compiled by The Times' library and movie

TRUE CONCERN SHOULD BE REDUCING NICOTINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will the new product ("R.J. Reynolds to Introduce a Less-Smelly Cigarette," 
Oct. 11) be a new version of its Salem menthol brand featuring a cigarette 
paper that reduces stale odors? Apparently there is still no concern with 
reducing the manipulation of the nicotine content. We can now look forward to 
cases of the sweetest-smelling nicotine-infected cancerous lungs in history. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if R.J. Reynolds really wanted to provide an example of good 
citizenship, it could help stamp out the country's vicarious smoking habit by 
treating its product with substances that decrease the cigarettes' nicotine 
content while at the same time increasing its stale and obnoxious odors.

ARTICLE INTERESTING BUT IRRELEVANT TO RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Informed Consent: Business, Consumers Are Getting Savvier About Choosing 
Health Plans," Oct. 16) was an interesting article but of no relevance to the 
residents of California. The august group of sources providing these 
comparisons must have omitted this state from their studies.With the advent of 
Assembly Bill 1672, my health insurance rate rose 95%. The replacement 
insurance, with greater deductible and less options, is still considerably 
higher than before. 
</P>
<P>
 An appropriate follow-up to this article would be to compare these costs 
within California. As an example, with a $500 deductible, a family in Los 
Angeles, with the parents under 30, could have a monthly premium of $336 for an 
annual rate of $4,032. Another family, with parents between 30 and 39, could 
pay $408 per month for an annual rate of $4,896. These rates are significantly 
higher than those indicated in your article and are far more representative of 
what is available to us. A true comparison must indicate what the costs are in 
California.

THANKS BUT NO THANKS TO AUTO-PRICING PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks, but no thanks. Our federal government has announced that it plans to 
investigate the practice of car dealers who engage in the selling of their 
product for a non-negotiable price ("Justice Dept.Starts Probe of Auto 
Pricing," Oct. 11). They believe this might be considered price fixing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, save us, please, from this unorthodox way of doing business. We, the 
public, would much rather fall into the den of a car dealer, and lest we really 
do our homework, pay thousands of dollars more than the ultra-sharp shopper who 
preceded us into that same dealership just hours ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After negotiations and the deal is done, we would proceed to the finance 
office and be offered undercoating, paint protection and a variety of 
unnecessary and costly additions. 
</P>
<P>
 "One price, take it or leave it!" Personally I might take it. Please protect 
us from the philosophy of these innovators.

FCC CHIEF'S 'TRUE FACTS' AN ORWELLIAN DIRECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "FCC Chief Wants Talk Radio to Deal in 'True Facts' " (Oct. 14) is shades of 
(George) Orwell's "1984," only 10 years later than originally anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Can FCC Chairman Reed Hundt abrogate the First Amendment to the Constitution 
by telling talk radio stations and their participants they must tell the truth? 
How about all the goop advertisers promise will make us beautiful, healthy and 
sexy? When have we heard anything believable from anyone in government? 
</P>
<P>
 "True Facts" is an interesting title since there are no such things as false 
facts.

WILSON FAILED TEST OF LEADERSHIP FOR STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't accept Michael J. Boskin's argument that as governor of California, 
Pete Wilson has only limited indirect influence on national and global economic 
events ("Wilson Is Better Candidate to Lead State Out of Long Nightmare," Oct. 
16). 
</P>
<P>
 To the contrary, as head of the nation's most populous state with one of the 
world's largest economies, a wise and politically cogent California governor 
conceivably could wield substantial influence domestically and abroad.Other 
than his persistent hounding for more federal dollars and a scant few economic 
development victories, Wilson hasn't used the California pulpit effectively for 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 However, we should not easily let Wilson off the hook for his failure in the 
one area where a governor clearly does have enormous influence: as a forceful 
and active advocate for the state he was elected to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after taking office, Wilson failed this test of leadership by publicly 
labeling California "a bad product," a damaging comment for any governor to 
make whatever his or her personal views of a state and its problems. 
Predictably, California's detractors and some economic development officials 
from competitor states promptly used Wilson's blanket condemnation of the state 
as license to denigrate California at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all states, California has its share of problems and challenges, but it 
does not deserve the "bad product" label. Wilson should apologize to all 
Californians for having uttered such a disgraceful comment.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: NOW FOR SOMETHING REALLY TASTELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk about ghoulish. 
</P>
<P>
 The O.J. Simpson masks and the Nicole Brown Simpson blond wigs that have 
appeared in costume stores are tasteless, to be sure, but the really grotesque 
marketing ploy of the season is last week's release of the O.J. workout video. 
</P>
<P>
 (In case you plan to take the low road on Halloween, you should be advised 
that, according to Simpson attorney Alan Dershowitz, the so-called O.J. mask, 
in fact, resembles one of his other celebrity-athlete clients, convicted rapist 
Mike Tyson.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson video was shot last May, less than three weeks before Nicole 
Simpson and Ron Goldman were murdered. Shortly after charges were filed against 
O.J. Simpson, executives of the Playboy Entertainment Group, which produced the 
tape, announced that they were reconsidering releasing the video. 
</P>
<P>
 The reconsideration doubtless lasted only as long as it takes to open a 
centerfold. Said a Playboy spokesman: "We don't feel like we are exploiting the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The hope, obviously, was that any potential buyers turned off by the murder 
charges would be offset by the morbidly curious willing to plunk down $14.95 
for a look. 
</P>
<P>
 The workout would be unremarkable -- absolutely unremarkable -- except for the 
fact that it affords the opportunity to spend 70 minutes with a man who now 
stands charged with slaughtering his ex-wife and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this a sweat that I detect?" asks a playful Simpson as the 25-minute 
aerobic workout segment concludes. Having watched the video twice, I can tell 
you it wasn't sweat I was trying to detect. 
</P>
<P>
 And isn't that the point? It's like peeking through your fingers at a train 
wreck: fascination and repulsion at war. In my case, I say with some chagrin, 
fascination prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is certainly what Playboy, and all other participants in the 
mini-industries that have sprung up around the case -- be they T-shirts or 
tell-alls -- are banking on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The video begins innocently enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, I'm O.J. Simpson," he says, with a strained bonhomie that persists 
throughout the entire tape. "You may know me as a sportscaster, a commercial 
pitchman or an actor, but I also played some pro football a while back. That 
was a couple years ago, a couple of good knees ago and a couple a million 
frequent flier miles ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, and a couple of . . . well, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've never seen a "Naked Gun" movie, you may not fully comprehend what a 
dreadful actor Simpson is. He is hammy, self-conscious and almost completely 
unbelievable, as this video proves, even when he's working out. When he 
delivers mini-lectures on nutrition while ensconced in the trophy room of his 
Brentwood estate ("Here's the skinny on fat!" and "Save that candy and cake for 
a really rainy day. And hopefully, you don't live in Seattle!"), you want to 
gag. 
</P>
<P>
 Except you're too busy watching for clues. 
</P>
<P>
 When Simpson shows stressed-out capitalists how to exercise while in the 
office, he cautions them not to work up a sweat: "We're just trying to get that 
blood flowing." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh-huh. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a video moment that seems destined to be widely lampooned, Simpson 
walks with a trainer near his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a great day!" he exclaims. "I used to think you had to run to get a 
workout like this. In recent years, some people have said it's better to walk. 
Hey, especially with a bad knee like I have. Well, I used to walk on the wild 
side, now I just . . . walk." 
</P>
<P>
 The video is aimed at the sedentary type, the guy who is too busy to go to the 
gym, a guy who . . . well, a guy kind of like Simpson himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be one of those guys that went out dancing a couple of days a 
week," says the Juice. "Today with my schedule, hey, I just don't have the 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to direct your attention," read the PR pitch letter, "to a 
particular portion of the video where O.J. discusses his own particular method 
of reducing stress. . . . You may find it intriguing." 
</P>
<P>
 I fast forward the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is sitting in a chair wearing business clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a little tip to deal with stress at the office," he says. "Take a 
one-minute vacation. I call it my little getaway." 
</P>
<P>
 Visions of white Broncos float through my head. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm a little angry or have a little too much stress, I have a little 
trick. I sit down, take some deep breaths and I think of Mt. St. Helens -- you 
know -- I think of the explosion, all that energy building up, and I see it 
exploding and shooting all of the dust into the air, and I just get all the 
exploding energy out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 When I called the PR man to ask what he found so intriguing about the scene, 
he said: "I guess it's just -- I dunno -- it struck several of us as a 
different way of reducing stress, that it might have the opposite effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Right. 
</P>
<P>
 And run that thing about not exploiting the situation by me again.

TAKING ISSUE WITH BLACK SWIMSUIT CALENDAR COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iam writing in response to the Oct. 10 article "Banking on a Recipe of Class 
and Cheesecake." I am shocked and angered at the opinion of the writer with 
regard to black women swimsuit models. 
</P>
<P>
 In writing about "The Darker Image" calendar, Howard Morehead's "Bronze Beauty 
Calendar" was mentioned as perennially popular, but the writer opined that it 
was "decidedly risque." 
</P>
<P>
 What is appalling is the implication that women who modeled for "Bronze 
Beauty" exemplified the stereotyped images of black women as "bitches and ho's" 
and that is why Bill Castello of Barnes & Noble "steered clear" of Morehead's 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 The many models in "Bronze Beauty" are college graduates and young 
professionals. It is appalling that this article tried to pit positive black 
calendars against one another and announce that only one was finally done 
right. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Editor's note: Gonzaque is the October, 1995, model for the "Bronze Beauty 
Calendar."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As a black photographer and producer of the "Bronze Beauty Calendar," I 
welcome another black calendar to the market and applaud photographer Ken 
Townsend for his efforts. I know how difficult it is to break down stereotypes. 
My objection was the imbalance of the article and the many errors. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Bronze Beauty Calendar," which has been on the market nine years, is the 
only calendar marketed internationally that glamorizes many beautiful ethnic 
women. If a thong bathing suit is risque, why not apply the same rules to the 
"Sports Illustrated Calendar" and the many other glamour calendars on the 
market? 
</P>
<P>
 While this is the first time a major book distributor has handled a black 
calendar, "Bronze Beauty" calendars have been in many bookstores not serviced 
by Barnes & Noble. 
</P>
<P>
 During Operation Desert Storm, the "Bronze Beauty Calendar" was the only 
swimsuit calendar to pass strict censorship from the Saudi Arabian government 
to be enjoyed by our servicemen there. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 and 1994 calendars won awards from the Calendar Marketing Assn. for 
Best Glamour Photography.

 Re "Banking on a Recipe of Class and Cheesecake," an apparent celebration of 
black women featured in a swimsuit calendar: I will forgo the argument that 
such photographs demean all women by reducing them to mere vehicles for male 
eroticism. Let us assume that the new calendar is, in fact, a tasteful 
portrayal of beautiful black women. 
</P>
<P>
 Where, if you don't mind me asking, are the black women? The article had two 
photos, one of Angelle Brooks, the other of Tracie Tyler, both of whom have 
light skin. Tyler appears to be as light as I am. I am white. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps dark-skinned women appear in the rest of Townsend's calendar. However, 
they were glaringly absent from The Times article. Were I a dark-skinned black 
woman, I would have been hurt and insulted by an endeavor that purported to 
celebrate my beauty, but rendered me yet again invisible.

OF WOMEN, BABIES AND FAMILY MATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "A Dream Denied" by Lynn Smith (Oct. 12): All right. That does it. I am so 
tired of receiving messages, via all forms of media, that women are going to 
end up miserable and -- God forbid -- unfulfilled, if they don't have children. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm tired of hearing and reading that the feminist movement is to blame for 
all the problems of the world and all the choices with which women now find 
themselves unsatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 I am tired of that meaningless term family values.  
</P>
<P>
 I am tired of the word family being used in commercials, where the word people 
has always been perfectly fine. "More and more families are drinking Tropicana 
orange juice." Excuse me, I drink Tropicana orange juice; don't I count?  
</P>
<P>
 I'm tired of all the insurance ads being aimed at people with babies, as if 
that is the only demographic group that matters. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sorry that so many women feel bereft that they are now too old to 
conceive. Hello! Does the word adopt mean anything to you? 
</P>
<P>
 I have been called selfish for not wanting children, but guess what? Wanting 
children is just as selfish, if not more. Smith writes of people spending 
upward of $100,000 with fertility clinics. Now, that's selfish.

 Yes, infertility is a source of great grief; the biological urge to reproduce 
is strong. 
</P>
<P>
 But reproducing and parenting are two very different things, as evidenced by 
the previously infertile mother who realized she hated being home all the time: 
</P>
<P>
 "Her restlessness was . . . a function of her oldest child's overactive 
personality. So she went back to school and got a job." 
</P>
<P>
 And did what with the child? 
</P>
<P>
 Many children in this heavily populated world are abandoned. Growing up 
without parents is far more tragic than the painful inability to conceive.

 In Lynn Smith's story about motherhood, there was no examination of the role 
business and its white male leaders played in the necessary decision for women 
now in their 40s and 50s to delay motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The white male Establishment decreed that we had to make a choice. They 
decreed this by not providing on-site child care, not permitting maternity 
leave and a return to our jobs, and not allowing flexible work schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 We did not give up children just to redress our mothers' lives. We had no 
other choice. 
</P>
<P>
 If women were in charge, we'd have it all because we know how to do it. Men 
don't.

 Last week, the old Soviet Union's last Communist leader offered to work free 
for Hollywood's last action hero. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Environmental Media Assn.'s annual awards, Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
Mikhail Gorbachev and Ted Turner were seated together.  
</P>
<P>
 During dinner, Schwarzenegger mentioned that he owns the rights (which once 
belonged to financially troubled Carolco) to "Crusade," a medieval epic in 
which, if it gets made, the bodybuilder/actor is expected to star. 
</P>
<P>
 As they dined on Patina's chicken with wild rice, Turner said Schwarzenegger 
should make the movie for him since the CNN mogul is now also in the film 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some banter across the table, when Gorbachev, who is a lawyer, joked 
that he would negotiate the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he won't be working over the deal points, Schwarzenegger said the 
former Soviet president "saw the film in a higher way. That it would show 
people the danger in crusades, in that kind of fanaticism, and not to do them 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Way: For those planning their social schedule around the visit by 
the Prince of Wales, the details of the royal trip to L.A. have been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 31, the day he arrives, Prince Charles will attend an evening 
reception at the British consul general's home. This is open only to guests of 
the consul and some organizers of the UK/LA festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday is the benefit premiere of TriStar's "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," 
with a dinner following at the Century Plaza. In accord with protocol, guests 
at the screening must be seated prior to the royal arrival. The audience will 
have free drinks and popcorn to munch on while they wait. As for popcorn for 
the prince, "I can assure you a minion will bring it to him if he wants it," 
said an organizer.  
</P>
<P>
 At the hotel, the prince will attend a VIP reception while the Los Angeles 
ballroom is filling with guests. Again, he'll enter the room when everyone is 
seated. Tickets are priced from $250 to $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday he'll attend the performance of the Royal Shakespeare Company's 
"Henry VI: The Battle for the Throne" at the Cerritos Center for the Performing 
Arts. The New Yorker Magazine Editor Tina Brown is hosting a private cocktail 
reception in the theater during the first interval. It will be in the prince's 
honor and he will attend. There's also a post-show back-stage reception 
sponsored by Allied Domecq. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, the presumably exhausted prince will attend a black-tie dinner 
co-hosted by MCA's Lew Wasserman and Arco's Lod Cook. The 250 guests will dine 
beneath a tent on the back lawn of Aaron and Candy Spelling's Holmby Hills 
mansion. Angela Lansbury will emcee. Tickets are $5,000 per couple with 
proceeds to be divided among half a dozen local charities.

 Writing Reader: If it's true everybody in Los Angeles is writing a screenplay, 
then the publishers of the new quarterly magazine Scenario should have no 
problem selling subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenario bills itself as "the Magazine of Screenwriting Art" and is set to 
debut in December. As the press release says, "Scenario is being launched at a 
time when the role of the screenwriter and screenplay in the motion picture 
process is receiving a great deal of attention. . . ." (Hey, boys and girls, 
can you say $4 million for a four-page Joe Eszterhas treatment?) 
</P>
<P>
 Among its offerings, the new mag will feature complete, original screenplays 
(that's original, as in before screenplays go through five writers and seven 
re-writes) of such films as "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and "Nashville." 
</P>
<P>
 We're hoping the magazine will also give advice to writers and struggling 
writers on how to cope with some big issues, such as how to get your agent to 
return your phone calls; how to react when a producer says, "I like it, but can 
you make the female lead a prostitute?" and how to develop as healthy an ego as 
Quentin Tarantino's.

UP ALL NIGHT: SOCIAL CLIMES; A STYLE ALL ITS OWN; AT THE HANA LOUNGE, EAST 
MEETS WEST AND INDIVIDUALITY RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 All too often the ambience of a hotel lobby lounge is more like an airport 
than a close, intimate nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so the Hana Lounge at the Hotel Nikko, where the mood is casual elegance. 
The bar's vast environs have a sense of Japanese spareness and serenity, 
sensibly balanced with Western comforts and blessedly free of the nerdy 
corporate vibe that lurks around the edges of most hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 The cocktail waitresses wear their own clothes, which run to platform boots 
and palazzo pants in a kind of elegant take on Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece is a fountain pool designed like a Japanese rock garden. 
Japanese fishing kites decorate the walls like big, papery dragonflies. Guests 
relax in sumptuous leather club chairs.  
</P>
<P>
 The overall effect is open and expansive, but far from barren. It's a place 
you can pass through or spend an evening. Coming here for a drink is somehow 
not so great a commitment as a trip to a jazz club, although an encounter with 
the Hana's resident Paul Turner Trio may prove equally rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people seem to wander in for a drink, or to meet a friend staying at the 
hotel, and find themselves reluctant to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great music. It's a great bar," says New York hairstylist Janet 
Windesheim, a hotel guest. Windesheim and her boyfriend, Lou Giacolone, are 
lolling in comfortable leather chairs, sharing cocktails and food with half a 
dozen friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were here last night," Giacolone says. "They were playing some Brubeck. He 
had that Gene Krupa thing going."  
</P>
<P>
 "No, no. I'd say it was more like Buddy Rich," says Ian Janes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the next table, a group of twentyish people in overalls and thermal 
undershirts lounge comfortably, some of them seated on the plush carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 Manfred Moennich, Nikko's general manager, presides from a corner sofa. He's 
wearing a flowered shirt in hues of pink, a green and violet cardigan, green 
twill pants, and a pair of truly stunning green and brown wingtips. It is 
nobody's style but his own, so rare and refreshing in this trendy town. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I've found about L.A. is the aspect of ultimate individuality," he 
says. "That's what makes it tick and click. This is a place you can either sit 
up straight or slouch down. I'm having a 1953 port wine, but if you want a rum 
and Coke, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bandleader Paul Turner is also wearing wingtips. Turner's band features Turner 
on drums, David Arana and Ben Tidosti on piano, Susan Lyster on a hot pink bass 
guitar and singer Theresa Turner, who does standards with sultry aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The band plays every Thursday, Friday and Saturday until midnight. (Turner's 
full 18-piece big band plays the Sunday brunch across the lobby at Pangaea.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Swing is making a comeback," Turner says. "Jazz has always been there, but 
swing started the whole concept of popular music."  
</P>
<P>
 But where's the dancing? 
</P>
<P>
 Turner glances across the room to where Moennich is sitting, then winks and 
snaps his fingers. "If The L.A. Times says there's dancing, the day this 
article comes out there'll be a dance floor here by 2 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Hana Lounge, Hotel Nikko, 465 S. La Cienega Blvd., Beverly Hills; (310) 
247-0400. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Paul Turner Trio plays Thursday through Saturday from 8 p.m. to 
midnight. The lounge is open from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. nightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: Beer $4.50 and up; well drinks start at $5.50; wines $5.50 to $28 a 
glass.; sushi and desserts $3.25 and up.

WESTSIDE WATCH: TIGERS AND QUARTERBACKS ALONG THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp stumped recently for Republican 
congressional candidate Susan Brooks, one of dozens of candidates he has 
visited this election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Brooks' chances "very favorable" against Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling 
Hills) in the 36th Congressional District, which follows the coast from Venice 
to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a fighter, she's a tiger, she's a quarterback," Kemp said at a local 
fund-raiser. "She was for NAFTA; Jane was against NAFTA," he said. ". . . How 
can you believe in free enterprise in California and not be for exporting 
computers and agriculture and widgets to Mexico? It just doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kemp and Brooks don't agree on everything. Kemp supports the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. So does Harman. But Brooks considers the pact a 
threat to U.S. sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kemp: "Unity does not require unanimity." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp and Brooks also part ways on Proposition 187, which would deny services 
to illegal immigrants. Kemp opposes the measure and Brooks supports it. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brooks: "We can agree to disagree." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 PAC-MAN: GOP congressional candidate Richard Sybert, who is now challenging 
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), is trying to spin a new logic for 
voters: that political action committee money is good, not bad. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated $60,000 he has received from PACs should be seen as a vote of 
confidence by the business community in his campaign pledge to lift roadblocks 
to commerce and job growth by working to lower taxes and cut government 
regulations, Sybert said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 This logic is partly defensive as Sybert braces for a Beilenson broadside in 
the hard-fought race in the 24th Congressional District, which includes Malibu 
and part of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 PAC contributions, the Democrat has said, represent unwholesome efforts by 
powerful special interests to influence lawmakers. Beilenson has pledged for 
years that he will not take such money. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sybert accuses Beilenson of indirectly taking PAC money. Beilenson, Sybert 
noted, accepts contributions from the state and national Democratic 
congressional campaign fund -- which directly takes PAC money itself. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 MODERATE OR CONSERVATIVE? According to state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El 
Segundo), the radical right is alive and well -- and contributing to opponent 
David Barrett Cohen's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills officials made the charge because of a $20,000 contribution from the 
campaign of state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) to Cohen, a Redondo Beach 
attorney. Hurtt is a conservative, evangelical Christian who is a leader in the 
party's efforts to reclaim the Senate and Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen "is trying to portray himself as a moderate Republican," said Tim Mock, 
Dills' campaign coordinator. "He has positions on issues that are very 
favorable (to the political right)." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cohen said that Hurtt, in his leadership post, must give to conservatives 
and moderates alike. And Cohen rejects the view that he's right-wing. Among 
other things, Cohen favors abortion rights and opposes Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to (the Dills campaign), I must be the world's only Christian 
fundamentalist who's Jewish," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28th State Senate District includes Marina del Rey, Venice and Playa del 
Rey.

MALIBU, CALABASAS ARE RANKED TOPS FOR ENTREPRENEURS; RESEARCH: AT NO. 28, THE 
TWO MAKE THE HIGHEST SHOWING OF WESTSIDE LOCALITIES IN A SURVEY ABOUT 
ATTRACTING AND KEEPING NEW, SMALL BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There may be better places in California than the Westside to start and grow 
new businesses, but six local communities are on a list of the state's top 85, 
according to a recently published study. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu and Calabasas, which were ranked together, made a showing at No. 28, 
topping the list of Westside localities in the study, conducted by Cognetics 
Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., an economic research firm with a database of more 
than 14 million companies nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Century City came next, at 33rd, followed closely by Santa Monica, which 
ranked 34th.  
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood and Burbank, considered as one, came in 43rd and the Los 
Angeles Wilshire area ranked 47th. In 71st place, and at the bottom of the list 
of Westside localities, was Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 To come up with its results, Cognetics counted the number of companies in the 
state that had started in the past four years and that were still in business 
with at least five employees. Cognetics also included firms that had started 
sometime during the last decade, but had grown substantially in the past four 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 Although some Westsiders were surprised that the combination of Malibu and 
Calabasas beat out Santa Monica in its appeal for entrepreneurs, others said 
that the Malibu area has an attraction of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing for businesses wanting to come to Malibu is the name here, 
the mystique," said Mary Lou Blackwood, executive vice president of the Malibu 
Chamber of Commerce, which has not seen a rise in its membership -- hovering at 
about 400 -- during the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception here is that there is money in the community," she said, "and 
that visitors usually spend, too." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one Malibu executive offered a more simple reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's great air, it's beautiful and it's safe," said Tim Novoselski, 
president and chief executive officer of Miramar Communications Inc., an 
80-person publishing company. Miramar moved from Culver City two months ago 
after employees expressed concern about their safety, Novoselski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's all utopia out here -- there are mudslides and fires -- 
but I love it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some real estate brokers who rent space on the Westside expressed 
doubt that Malibu is attracting many new businesses. Most of the strength for 
start-ups and growing firms is in Calabasas, they said, where lower rents and 
the proximity to Woodland Hills has caused new businesses to blossom. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is not much commercial real estate available in Malibu -- just 
297,000 square feet of office space compared to the 10 million square feet in 
Century City, they said. Currently, 90% of Malibu's offices are rented and the 
city has no plans to add more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an anti-growth city -- they have made that really clear," said Tony 
Dorn, a senior consultant for Beitler Commercial Realty Services, a real estate 
brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, which ranked well below Malibu and Calabasas, the Chamber of 
Commerce has started a new recruiting program to bring in new companies, 
according to Kelly Morgan, the chamber's manager of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most of the city's newest commercial tenants are well-established 
companies -- Playboy Enterprises' West Coast headquarters and the retail store 
Barneys New York, for example. The city is being selective, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for businesses that match the Beverly Hills business culture -- 
entertainment companies, marketing offices, professional firms like accountants 
and attorneys," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica, which Cognetics ranked 34th in California and third among cities 
on the Westside as a haven for new, small companies, is the true local enclave 
for start-ups and growing firms, said one commercial real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more of the entrepreneurial environment in Santa Monica, where 
people are working in garages and in warehouses," said Howard Sadowsky, 
executive vice president of Julien J. Studley Inc., a nationwide commercial 
brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet there are more entrepreneurs doing exciting stuff there that people 
don't know about, but garages don't make it on any lists."

TEMPLE'S GROWTH PLANS PROTESTED; DEVELOPMENT: NEIGHBORS INSIST THEY'VE BEEN 
KEPT IN THE DARK ABOUT THE PROJECT'S SCOPE. BUT SINAI REPRESENTATIVES DOWNPLAY 
THE NEGATIVE REACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Donna Moffitt, who lives two blocks away, first heard rumblings about it in 
January. Sheila Manning, who lives half a block south, said she got an inkling 
of it last month. And David Licht, who lives across the street, said he learned 
what it was all about only four weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find the whole thing extremely shocking," Licht said angrily. "It's going 
to completely destroy the use of our premises." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the suddenly controversial expansion proposed for the four-story Sinai 
Temple in Westwood that, if completed, will transform what is already among the 
nation's largest Conservative Jewish temples into a facility capable of 
accommodating up to 250 more preschool and day school students. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the complex would sprawl over an entire block, be encircled by an 
eight-foot-high wall and add 82,000 square feet, almost doubling its current 
size. Plans also call for building a 528-car underground garage, 23 classrooms, 
an auditorium and a rooftop playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the expansion will create enough traffic and noise -- especially 
from the playground -- to destroy the tranquillity of the area surrounding the 
temple, at Wilshire and Beverly Glen boulevards. Several zoning changes must be 
approved before it can proceed, opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project is way too big for the (location)," said Richard Agay, a 
Westwood resident who opposes the expansion. "It is a horrendous thing to begin 
making exceptions for." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, who has even attended services at the temple in the past, agrees. "I 
don't mind a temple on that corner. I'd like the whole world to be Jewish. But 
not on the roof." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the temple say that much of the negative reaction is based on a 
misunderstanding of the scope of the expansion and the measures being 
considered to mitigate potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Don Baker, who represents Sinai Temple, said that the primary concern 
of many residents -- added traffic -- will actually be alleviated with the 
construction of the two-level underground garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though it will add more traffic . . . overall, the situation will be 
improved because there will be no traffic stacked up on the street," Baker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said most of the zoning variances required by the project are minor and 
said the area is already approved for school use as long as the temple obtains 
a conditional use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that, in response to community concern, the temple has agreed to 
surround the rooftop playground with sound-absorbing walls and to restrict the 
use of the roof after 6:30 p.m., except on religious holidays. And he said the 
temple has worked closely for two years with the Westwood Homeowners' Assn. to 
elicit residents' responses.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet that is part of the problem, say opponents of the expansion. They allege 
that some association board members have kept the community largely in the dark 
concerning the temple's plans, while generally acceding to its wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the present expansion was first envisioned in 1992, after a member 
bequeathed some of the property to the temple, residents and others say only in 
the last few months has word about it been disseminated throughout the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The only information sent out, they say, was a notice mailed last month of a 
community meeting to be held between temple representatives and the homeowners 
association. And that meeting was scheduled only one week before the expansion 
was debated before the city's zoning administrator. On Sept. 29, the 
administrator placed the project on hold for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never made aware that this was such a big project," said Moffitt, 
herself an association board member who opposes the expansion. "No one was 
told." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Prang, spokesman for Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents many of 
the residents who live across from the temple, said the councilwoman is not 
opposed to the project in principle but wishes that the expansion plan had been 
discussed more openly. "We had not been contacted by the Sinai Temple. We were 
not brought up to speed to the degree we should have been," Prang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moffitt and others also say that the homeowners association has been reluctant 
to take a stand on the issue to avoid opposing Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who 
conditionally supports the expansion and whose district includes the temple. 
(Yaroslavsky's district borders Galanter's along Ashton Avenue, a side street 
one block south of Wilshire Boulevard.) 
</P>
<P>
 According to Moffitt and fellow opponent Art Shapiro, homeowners association 
president Joyce Foster has never fully opposed the project and at one point 
discouraged the group's members from attending the zoning hearing to protest 
the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (organization) . . . has been very afraid to take active positions," 
Shapiro said. "They have recently begun to appreciate that they have not had a 
good reading of what the community wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster and Yaroslavsky deny that attempts were made to keep residents unaware 
of the project, saying that the issue was brought up at an association meeting 
in March attended by 150 homeowners, including Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster called allegations that she discouraged residents from attending the 
zoning hearing "absolutely untrue." She said the expansion was first mentioned 
in an association newsletter sent to members in December, 1993, and that the 
notice of September's community meeting was mailed to more than 900 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledged, however, that in both instances details about the size of 
the project were not mentioned because they weren't known. Baker, the attorney, 
said that an architect's model showing the approximate size of the expansion 
became available more than a year ago. Although the association has taken a 
neutral stand on the expansion, Foster said, the group is preparing to mail a 
questionnaire seeking the community's views. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could (the temple) have done a better job of informing the community?" Foster 
asked. "Probably. Could (the association) have done a better job? Probably."

DECISION '94: SPOTLIGHT ON LOCAL ELECTIONS; BOWEN VOWS NOT TO GET TOO CONFIDENT 
IN ASSEMBLY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Debra Bowen is running her first reelection campaign with the 
traditional perks of an incumbent -- name recognition, political allies and a 
campaign war chest far larger than her opponent's. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite that edge, Bowen, a Democrat, says she's not overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always run like I'm behind," she said. "It's part of my nature. I never 
assume anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike much of the Westside, Bowen's 53rd District -- which stretches from 
Venice to Marina del Rey, Westchester and the South Bay -- is not necessarily 
friendly to Democrats. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a narrow 
43% to 41%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen's Republican opponent, commercial insurance agent Julian Sirull, said 
one of his main qualifications is that he's not an incumbent politician. He 
hopes to benefit from Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection campaign and from the trend 
favoring Republicans nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sirull acknowledges that he is not getting as much financial support from 
the Republican Party as he would like. As of Sept. 30, his campaign had $15,946 
in the bank, far below Bowen's $79,546. He had spent $4,988, compared with 
$53,960 by Bowen. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sirull, a lack of financial support from the party could mean the 
difference between a close race and an easy reelection for Bowen, said GOP 
political strategist Allan Hoffenblum. "If the party puts money in there, it 
would be competitive," he said. "If they don't, they're punting." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen touts her endorsements from the mayors of Torrance and Lomita, the Assn. 
of Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs and other organizations. She's also banking on 
personal relationships with voters established in town hall meetings and on her 
Assembly record. 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote a bill that provides computer access to state legislative 
information, such as legislators' voting records, the text of bills and their 
status. Anyone with access to the Internet computer network can get the 
information for free. Bowen extols the program as a way to bring people closer 
together. "For most people, Sacramento might as well be Mars," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sirull questions its value. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many people really take advantage of that?" he said. "How many people 
really care about that? How does that help someone who's been laid off from TRW 
or Hughes? How does that help them get a job?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen's other legislative achievements include new laws to help businesses get 
variances from air-quality districts, to force state agencies to coordinate the 
oversight of toxic cleanups and to require the state to publicize condom 
reliability testing data. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first political campaign in 1992, she won a bitter race for the 
Assembly, winning 55% of the vote to Republican Brad Parton's 41%. Bowen, 38, 
said being in the Assembly leaves her no time for her former law practice, 
which specialized in small-business start-ups, tax law and environmental law. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirull, 36, said he would help businesses by seeking a cut in the corporate 
income tax and changing the workers' compensation system, which he said is now 
stacked against employers.  
</P>
<P>
 The corporate tax rate, which is higher here than in neighboring states, and 
the workers' compensation system are encouraging businesses to leave 
California, he said. He insists that any revenue lost from lowering corporate 
taxes would be offset by increased collections as a result of the generally 
improved business climate. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; MAKING POWERFUL ART IN THE 'HOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ENRIQUE LAVIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stare at the barrel of a 9-millimeter handgun pointed by the grim image of a 
gangbanger in ". . . Andblastin'back." Get caught in the cross-fire of "Red 
Reality, Blue Insanity," two paintings showing Bloods and Crips shooting at 
each other. Or sympathize with a weeping mother in "Momma: Receiving Bad News 
From Bad News." 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the works of Romelle D'Minter, a 29-year-old South-Central 
Los Angeles artist inspired by the gang life around his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 On exhibit through Nov. 13 at the Julie Rico Gallery in Santa Monica, 
D'Minter's "Something Wickedly Frightening" is a body of black-and-white 
paintings depicting "organized crime in the 'hood" in a style of art he calls 
"inner-city Expressionism." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reflection of a violent reality," said Rico, owner of the 2-year-old 
gallery on Main Street. "It's poetry from the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Likening D'Minter's works to the impact of Michelangelo's in the 16th Century, 
Rico said, "(Michelangelo) made (people) proud of their community for what it 
was; that's what (D'Minter) is doing. Amid the negativity surrounding him, he 
is able to articulate a language that is foreign to most communities." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Minter's language assaults viewers. The paintings, framed with his trademark 
black-iron, anti-burglar bars, dramatize urban gang wars, helplessness and 
empowerment through violence. He simply paints what he sees, he said -- the 
sense of isolation and persecution of people he grew up with and whom he has 
often seen die violently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of my friends were either going to the cemetery or the 
penitentiary," D'Minter said. "I can't even count the number of friends who 
have died. I did a lot of my work in black and white because of the memories I 
had when I was a child. There was nothing colorful about it all -- it was 
death." 
</P>
<P>
 In "For the Dead Homies," a young gangster is pouring Olde English malt liquor 
in the street while holding a sawed-off double-barreled shotgun. The work 
depicts a gang ritual for when a friend is incarcerated or dies, D'Minter said. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Minter is breaking into the mainstream with exhibitions in small galleries 
across the city, embraced by a handful patrons of non-traditional art. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is considered counter-fashion in the art world because its about real 
life," Rico said. "These individuals (captured on painting) are real. Good or 
bad, we as a society should accept that notion because society had failed 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 From the Arroyo Gallery in Pasadena to Gallery X in Hollywood to Zero 1 
Gallery on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, D'Minter's work is being recognized 
as a legitimate form of art. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as dark and underground as it gets. You've seen it in cinema and 
other media; this is just another form of expressing what's going on in their 
world," said Dave Klane, owner of Gallery X. "It's shocking and disturbing to a 
lot of people, and that's good." 
</P>
<P>
 From his bedroom-studio near 49th and Western, D'Minter conceptualized the 
idea of depicting a world of drugs and violence. He knows the street talk and 
walk, but he says he stayed out of gangs "because I was never into teams . . . 
blue fighting red." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Minter began experimenting with various forms of art in 1981. After he 
graduated from Chatsworth High School in the San Fernando Valley, he enrolled 
in Otis College of Art and Design for two years until he ran out of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued by Hollywood movies of organized crime from the '30s and '40s and 
the hardship that forced mobsters into criminal roles, D'Minter said the 
parallels with his culture were too obvious to ignore.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I looked around, I said 'This is going on around in my front yard,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Something Wickedly Frightening' is a revolutionary antidote to the 
problem," D'Minter said. "I'm not trying to glamorize (that lifestyle). I'm 
just painting what I see, so people can realize that it exists." ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: LOS ANGELES; STREET VIOLENCE KILLS 2ND PANTHER FIREFIGHTER; 
CRIME: GUNMAN TAKES LIFE OF VIRGIL BLANDSON. THE VICTIM'S TROUBLED LIFE HAD 
TAKEN A GOOD TURN WHEN HE JOINED THE SOUTH-CENTRAL EMERGENCY RESERVE CREW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The South Central Panthers, who forged a name for themselves by setting aside 
gang conflicts to fight fires in Malibu and elsewhere, have lost a second 
member to the kind of street violence the group so often deplored. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgil Blandson, 23, was gunned down Oct. 11 in South-Central Los Angeles 
during a quarrel with a man who apparently owed him money, police said. 
Blandson is the second Panther in six months to be killed under unclear 
circumstances; Maurice White, 23, was shot to death at a party March 5. No 
arrest has been made in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police have arrested one man on suspicion of being an accessory to 
the Blandson shooting, which occurred after he drove his truck to a house 
expecting to sell the vehicle to the person who shot him. The unidentified 
shooter is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Panthers, it was another tough loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virgil was one of the better crew members, very conscientious," said crew 
manager Ron Lamont, director of the Los Angeles Unemployed Council, the 
Crenshaw-based organization that recruits the firefighters. "His spirit was in 
the right place. . . . This is a real shame." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Forestry Service organized the Panthers in June, 1993, as an 
experimental job program to train central Los Angeles residents as firefighter 
reserves. The service's regular crews had been depleted by budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 After brief but rigorous training, crew members acted as an on-call auxiliary 
unit to aid firefighters in the Angeles National Forest, Malibu and other 
fire-prone areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Blandson, like most of the 50 other members, was more than happy to answer the 
call, which came frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Brenda Thomas, recalled a day when the phone rang at 3 a.m. 
Blandson, fresh out of training and living with his mother in Alhambra at the 
time, rolled out of bed immediately to dress and hit the road to pick up fellow 
members who needed transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Mama, I got to go, I don't know when I'll be back,' " recalled 
Thomas. "He was energy, energy, energy. . . . Always hyped up with a smile on 
his face, always optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said that her son was not a gang member but he knew plenty of guys who 
were, and struggled constantly to maintain his integrity in his South-Central 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me he was being harassed, that guys were breaking into his apartment 
and taking things," said Thomas. "I said, 'Why don't you move?' But he said no, 
he wanted to be independent." 
</P>
<P>
 Blandson had moved out of his mother's house in May for the first time, 
excited by his new job with the Panthers and the prospect of earning good, 
steady money. 
</P>
<P>
 He had worked in other jobs -- most recently as a Downtown Los Angeles 
security officer -- but fretted over not making enough to set up his own 
household. Although he initially balked at becoming a Panther because it didn't 
seem like steady enough work, Blandson eventually joined at the behest of his 
friend and veteran Panther Jerry Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 A gangly young man with a ready smile, Blandson had a love of nature, 
especially birds, that made firefighting in the wilderness even more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 An avid member of the L.A. Pigeon Club, he kept a roomful of caged pigeons and 
accurately predicted the days his females would hatch squabs. Blandson was a 
one-time trainee with the city Animal Regulation Department and dreamed of 
being a full-time forest ranger, Thomas said. But he also had his share of 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Blandson dropped out of Alhambra High School, citing an inability to keep up 
with tough academic standards. He graduated from continuation school in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He was jailed several times for unpaid traffic tickets, and once was arrested 
on suspicion of attempted murder but later released. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a worsening attitude toward police and authority, Thomas said her son 
never stopped wanting to work for the government as a forest ranger. He would 
shake his head as he told his mother about Panthers who acted disrespectfully 
toward others, "ignorant brothers" who didn't know any better. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, said Thomas, it was that ignorance that claimed her son's life. 
"He talked about getting out of his neighborhood, moving to Hawthorne or 
somewhere better like that," she said sadly. "He never made it there." ERIN J.

COVER STORY; VENICE'S WILD RIDE; QUIRKY COMMUNITY CONSIDERS ANOTHER SEA CHANGE 
IN ITS TUMULTUOUS EXISTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS PLEASURE and ADRIAN MAHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Venice draws life from poets and performers, bodybuilders and bohemians, but 
the seaside community owes its existence to a coin toss. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety years ago, Abbot Kinney, a tobacco tycoon and budding Los Angeles land 
developer, lost confidence in his Westside business partners. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is now south Santa Monica, the partners had developed a commercial 
district and pioneered the Southland's first successful amusement business -- 
the Ocean Park Amusement Pier. But Kinney felt stymied by his associates' 
unwillingness to support his more grandiose plans. 
</P>
<P>
 So after months of bickering, Kinney and his fellow officers of the Ocean Park 
Development Co. sat down in January of 1904 and flipped a coin to divide their 
holdings. Kinney won the toss and -- to the shock of his partners -- chose to 
take control of a 1.5-mile stretch of salt marshes south of Navy Street instead 
of the far more valuable developed Ocean Park land. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coastal dunes and wetlands, Kinney saw the potential for a new Pacific 
city of Old World charm. Using his own money, the canny entrepreneur built 
Venice of America within 19 months, a resort community of canals and gondolas, 
of pavilions and cafes that soon rivaled Ocean Park and its pier. Wild rides 
and sideshows soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine," said 83-year-old Al Arnold, who has lived in the same Venice house 
near the oceanfront for 77 years. "When you got to the beach, you found 
spectacular rides -- heart-stoppers -- dance halls, a gigantic indoor saltwater 
plunge, two roller coasters, fun houses. It was a regular circus." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a stunning creation that transformed an idle backwater into one of the 
world's largest entertainment playgrounds and set the tone for a community that 
to this day has continued to reinvent itself. For 90 years, waves of builders, 
hustlers, dreamers, vaudevillians, poets and promoters have washed through the 
community, creating a place that has thrived on all creeds and attitudes, 
celebrated the sublime and worshiped the ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 As present-day Venice agonizes over plans to renovate its popular oceanfront 
boardwalk, those with long local histories may feel more than a small sense of 
deja vu. The most publicized proposal, calling for brick paving, antique 
lighting, designated performance areas and more, is backed by merchants and 
property owners concerned about competition from Santa Monica's Third Street 
Promenade, the Universal CityWalk and Pasadena's Old Town district. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has stirred strong opposition from many residents, activists and 
street performers concerned that commercially driven renovation might stifle 
the boardwalk's freewheeling spirit. They have offered an alternative plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The renovation efforts can hardly be considered novel. Venice is very much the 
product of self-promotion. In its early years, the community constantly made 
and remade itself, locked in a struggle with competing attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why, for some, the prospect of a modern day make-over sounds familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, the (commercial) ghosts of the past have come back to haunt Venice 
and kept alive this constant struggle for definition," said Elayne Alexander, 
an archivist and historian at the Venice Historical Society. "Nothing's really 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Venice, to be sure, has not always been given to promotional campaigns. In 
recent decades, in fact, its appeal has been largely laissez-faire, as a quirky 
anything-goes outpost for the Beats in the 1950s, hippies in the 1960s and '70s 
and New Agers now.  
</P>
<P>
 But under Kinney, the making and remaking of Venice was nothing if not 
deliberate -- and always commercially driven. Using massive amounts of daring 
and showmanship, he created Venice of America, a sort of precursor to 
Disneyland, and lured the public away from the Ocean Park Amusement Pier owned 
by his former partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Stanton, a local Venice historian, in his book "Venice, California -- 
Coney Island of the Pacific," has meticulously documented the struggle that 
followed between Kinney and the other real estate interests seeking to develop 
the beachfront. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinney and his competitors anchored their resort communities with amusement 
piers and warred against each other for the attention of immigrants hungry for 
entertainment. Overnight, the coast from Redondo Beach to Santa Monica 
mushroomed into an entertainment complex, jam-packed with wharves, 
mind-boggling rides, international restaurants and carny concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the highly competitive period of 1903-1920, Kinney, the Doge of Venice, 
reigned supreme over the growing amusement park scene. His Venice of America 
was the crown jewel of the oceanfront, or as one vintage postcard series of 
photos proclaimed, "The Capitol of Joyland." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Bay's pristine beaches had become accessible to the general 
public in 1877 thanks to a growing network of rail lines emanating out across 
the Los Angeles Basin from Pasadena, the Santa Fe Railway's most westerly 
passenger terminus. Los Angeles residents, beckoned by the cheap fares, flocked 
to the ocean on weekends and during the summer tourist season.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Al Arnold's 89-year-old brother Arch: "People came from all over, riding 
the Pacific Electric's Red Cars. They were hanging out the windows like they 
were on their way to the Promised Land. Kinney even had a monkey farm on the 
end of the pier, an aquarium full of seals and sea lions. Venice was quite the 
place. There was something for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinney had as his centerpiece the startling Midway Plaisance. Located 
alongside the Venice Grand Lagoon (now the Venice traffic circle), it was a 
collection of amusements that included camel rides, freak shows and foreign 
exhibits from the attendance-breaking 1906 Columbian Exposition in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 His nearest competitors -- former partners Alexander Fraser, G.M. Jones and 
H.R. Gage -- were able to make life hard for Kinney's enterprise. As bosses of 
the Ocean Park section of Santa Monica, which had jurisdiction over Kinney's 
property, they used their influence to delay his building permits, limit his 
business hours and block his requests for public services. 
</P>
<P>
 Their tactics, however, only strengthened Kinney's desire to win Venice's 
independence from Ocean Park. 
</P>
<P>
 He counterattacked by adding more attractions to his pier -- animal exhibits, 
a ballroom and special events, including a performance featuring actress Sarah 
Bernhardt. He doubled the size of his Ship Cafe (shaped like a boat), and began 
construction on an indoor hot saltwater plunge just west of the property now 
occupied by the Sidewalk Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ocean Park powers forbade Kinney to complete the plunge (it was in 
competition with Ocean Park's Bath House) and scheduled the illegally 
constructed building foundations to be dynamited on June 10, 1907. 
</P>
<P>
 That morning, Kinney's wife, Margaret, mobilized the "Pick & Shovel" civic 
club and staged a sit-in with 200 women and children who picnicked atop the 
foundations. By noon the dynamiters had departed. Kinney pressed on with his 
plans and the plunge opened June 21, 1908. On peak days, it accommodated 2,000 
bathers and required 11 lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd go in the back door, 'bargain prices' it was called," said Liz Howland 
Smith, 68, a lifelong Venice resident who spent many days at the plunge as a 
youth. "We didn't use their towels or their showers. We wore scratchy wool 
bathing suits with buttons down the front, rubber caps. The old people would 
sit next to the fountain where the hot water came out. It was, when you look 
back at it, all very therapeutic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, Kinney quickened his promotional pace, adding an aquarium on his 
amusement pier that historian Stanton says contained "the finest collection of 
marine specimens on the West Coast." Kinney had the "Venice Scenic Railroad" 
built alongside Ocean Front Walk, a ride that took a roller coaster-style 
journey with a brakeman aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1911, he installed a Ferris wheel -- the first on the West Coast 
-- purchased from the Seattle-Yukon Exposition. On Zephyr Street, alongside 
Ocean Front Walk, promoters opened a "Captive Balloon Ride," a hydrogen-filled 
balloon tethered to a 1,400-foot-long cable. In March, the "Merry Widow" 
opened, a ride of tilting, swirling cups. And soon after, at the entrance to 
his pier, a water ride was installed. Called the "Rapids," it was immediately 
inundated by a public eager to be tumbled for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 29, 1911, Abbot Kinney's Italian-style, canal-lined real estate 
development finally became the city of Venice. Venetian voters approved 
Kinney's cityhood proposal, ending his six-year-long struggle to transform his 
Italian dream into an American reality. Cityhood gave Kinney the freedom to 
compete more creatively and with less interference. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kinney's competition did not rest. On June 17, 1911, Fraser and his Ocean 
Park partners, eager to counter Kinney's growing success, opened their new 
1,250-foot-long Million Dollar Pier in Ocean Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Its showpiece was the "Grand Canyon Electric Railroad," which ran out over the 
water along the end of the pier. In the middle of the pier stood a 
135-foot-tall mountain covered with electric lights that at night looked like 
an exploding volcano. Fraser's pier had a revolving cafe, a dance hall, ice 
cream parlors and numerous attractions, including a futuristic exhibit of 
incubators for newborns. 
</P>
<P>
 It also had a Crooked House, a maze-like structure that Stanton says was an 
"early fun house." Near the Ocean Park Amusement Pier, Frazer installed an Auto 
Maze ride, a forerunner of bumper cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Kinney died on June 30, 1911, six years to the day after she had 
turned on the electric lights of her husband's Venice of America development. 
Five days later, on the Fourth of July, Kinney opened the world's largest 
roller coaster, "Race Thru the Clouds," which became the ride sensation of the 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then tragedy struck the rival pier to the north: On Sept. 3, 1912, Fraser's 
Million Dollar Pier caught fire and burned to the ground. Young children, 
trapped and confused in the Crooked House, perished in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Ocean Park bounced back from the tragedy, outlining plans to rebuild a 
fire-proof cement pier by 1913. And the promotions and counter-promotions 
continued, with Kinney and his competitors using every imaginable ploy to get 
people to take the trolley to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1913, the city of Venice fielded a baseball team that played in the major 
leagues for three years. Soon after, the Grand Prix road race was created, 
running along the Venice Speedway to Playa del Rey and back. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mack Sennett's Keystone Film Co. began holding bathing beauty parades 
along the Venice oceanfront. 
</P>
<P>
 The pier was a very lively place, said Al Arnold. "People were gamblin' on the 
. . . floors of the Ship's Cafe, diving off the pier for money, getting married 
in the sea. The scene in Venice was known (everywhere). And I should know, I 
worked in the merchant marine and saw the enthusiasm for Venice worldwide."  
</P>
<P>
 After years of spectacular success that saw the rebuilding of Fraser's pier, 
expansion of Abbot Kinney's pier, Hindu fakirs, sword swallowers, operas and 
electric trams, the oceanfront complex finally started to show some cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 4, 1920, Abbot Kinney died of lung cancer. Six weeks later, the Kinney 
pier, with all of its innumerable attractions, was destroyed by fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember the night (it) burned down," said 83-year-old Frank Watson, a 
Venice native and resident. "We lived on Indiana, and went down to the 
oceanfront at Brooks Avenue to watch. I can still hear the seals screaming. It 
was a quarter of a mile away. They were in a big tank and the water began to 
boil. Burning embers were falling in the water, hissing. It was awful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Venice, it had been a long, strange ride, from being the rage to almost 
being razed. After Kinney died, the city, long plagued by problems of canal 
water circulation, Santa Monica sewage runoff and beachfront pollution, chose 
annexation in 1925 with the city of Los Angeles as a solution to its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some saw the move as the beginning of the community's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone hoped annexation would solve the problems but the city of L.A. did 
nothing to help," Watson said. "They filled in the canals, which caused still 
other problems; and those they didn't fill in, they abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Venice's Ocean Front Walk stands as one of the Southland's most popular 
tourist destinations, attracting more than 3 million visitors annually. But 
recent years have proved unsettling. A lingering recession has frayed nerves 
among oceanfront merchants and street performers. Gang fights and drug dealing 
have upset residents. And rival attractions in the Los Angeles area have posed 
intense competition. 
</P>
<P>
 It is against this backdrop that the community is debating plans for another 
make-over, which would be financed with $10 million in park bond funds approved 
by voters in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Arch Arnold speculated on what Kinney would have done: "Why not build 
something that will generate income, like a roller coaster? A dance hall would 
still be a hell of an attraction."

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: ANTIQUES FAIR IN BRUGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KENNEALLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruges, Belgium, a well-preserved medieval Flemish city -- some say the 
best-preserved medieval city in Europe -- will play host to the 11th 
International Fine Art and Antiques Fair, which opens Saturday and coincides 
with the last weeks of an elaborate exhibition documenting the work of 
15th-Century Bruges artist Hans Memling. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60 dealers from across Europe and the United States are expected to 
attend the nine-day fair in the long galleries of the Halle, once the city's 
cloth market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hans Memling: Five Centuries of Reality and Fiction" at the Groeninge Museum 
marks the so-called "Memling Year" on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of 
the artist's death. Few medieval artists were as prolific as Memling 
(1440-1494), whose portraits, religious paintings and altarpieces are scattered 
throughout the world. Many of these have been returned to Bruges for the 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 More information about the antiques fair is available from organizers Gil G. & 
C. Tuteleers in Bruges, tel. 011-32-50-354007, fax. 011-32-50-370587; and from 
the Belgian Tourist Office, 780 3rd Ave., Suite 1501, New York, N.Y. 10017; 
tel. (212) 758-8130, fax (212) 355-7675. The Memling show runs through Nov. 15 
at the Groeninge Museum. CHRIS KENNEALLY

five years, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. The warriors were 
discovered 20 years ago by peasants who were sinking wells. Since then, about

BOOKS TO GO: PEACE CORPS WRITERS TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GOING UP COUNTRY; TRAVEL ESSAYS BY PEACE CORPS WRITERS, edited by John 
Coyne(Charles Scribner's Sons, $21 hardcover).  
</P>
<P>
 "For . . . five years in the United States," writes Susan K. Lowerre in "To 
Spend the Night Laughing," her contribution to this collection, "I longed for 
Senegal: the unfenced desert and the magical green-blue river cutting through 
it, swift kingfishers collecting along its banks. I missed the villagers' 
greetings, their warmth and easy laughter, the simple wisdom they possess -- 
that life and death are in store for all of us." A number of one-time Peace 
Corps volunteers have turned into writers, it seems (Paul Theroux, for 
instance, once served the organization in Malawi). "Going Up Country" gives 13 
of them the chance to return to their former haunts, both recalling their 
former adventures and observing the places today. Theroux is not represented 
here -- about the best-known of the contributors is probably GQ columnist and 
author Bob Shacochis -- but the prose is solid and occasionally inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the tales (for instance, Mary-Ann Tirone Smith's "Piquing the 
Spirits," set in Cameroon) are darkly comic; others, like Lowerre's account of 
Senegal, are a bit on the romantic side. There's lots of personality in this 
volume, though, and there are plenty of small illuminations of places little 
known to most of us. 
</P>
<P>
 JUKEBOX AMERICA; DOWN BACK STREETS AND BLUE HIGHWAYS IN SEARCH OF THE 
COUNTRY'S GREATEST JUKEBOX by William Bunch (St. Martin's Press, $22.95 
hardcover).  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't suppose you would find one man in a hundred," Robert Benchly once 
wrote, "who has made a nickel by taking a drink." Well, William Bunch may not 
have figured out how to make money by drinking, but he did come up with a way 
to bring in a few bucks by hanging out in bars and taverns and such all over 
America. Simultaneously, he also came up with a new way to approach what might 
be called the American "road chronicle" -- that genre of books, of which a 
dozen or so are published annually, that recount the adventures of one soul or 
another as he or she wanders this great land of ours in pursuit of some thing 
or other. In Bunch's case, the journey ranges from Manhattan to Seattle, 
Chicago to the Mississippi Delta -- and the Grail for which he searches is what 
he irreverently calls the Juke of the Covenant, which is to say the greatest 
jukebox in America. Bunch, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for New York 
Newsday, combines a reporter's ear for dialogue with a feature-writer's eye for 
color, and comes up with a very entertaining book -- full of musical asides, 
observations on America's bar culture(s), and a fair amount of 
talkin'-'bout-his-generation. And, yes, he finally finds his Juke of the 
Covenant; to his credit, though, he doesn't stop jukeboxing once he does. 
</P>
<P>
 AUSTRALIA FOR WOMEN, edited by Susan Hawthorne & Renate Klein (The Feminist 
Press at the City University of New York, $17.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Australia is a macho country where the men call all the women Sheila, right? 
Not in this book. This Australia is a place with a "rich culture of women that 
dates back 40,000 years or more" (roughly about as far as the rich culture of 
men, I'd guess), a country full of "women's cultural events, historical sites, 
and women-run enterprises." Though there is guidebook-style material scattered 
throughout this volume, there's a lot more to it than that. It is a compilation 
of prose (and sometimes poetry) by and about women in Australia, sometimes 
academic, sometimes polemical, widely varying in literary merit, covering 
everything from the arts to the nature of Australian cities and countrysides to 
wildlife and social customs. Some chapter titles: "Puppets to Playwrights: 
Girls on Stage," "Walking in the Wilderness -- Tasmania," "Women in the 
Tropical North," "The Revolutionary Nature of Lesbian Organic Gardening" and 
"Rural Women's Syndrome." This is the first in a series of books, with "Italy 
for Women" and "Greece for Women" to follow next. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick trips: 
</P>
<P>
 ALASKA; PLANNING YOUR OWN TRIP, third edition, by Cindy Roland (Salmonberry 
Publishing Co., $8.95 paper). A nuts-and-bolts how-to-do-it guide with an 
authoritative tone ("Day 13 -- Rent car and drive the Kenai Peninsula; spend 3 
nights"), though certainly not an unfriendly one ("I'd sure like to hear how 
your trip goes"). 
</P>
<P>
 HOSTELLING INTERNATIONAL 1994; AFRICA, AMERICA, ASIA AND OCEANIA and 
HOSTELLING INTERNATIONAL 1994; EUROPE AND THE MEDITERRANEAN (both Hostelling 
International, $10.95 paper). These comprehensive, official Hostelling 
International network guides, in English, French, German and Spanish, are 
simply abbreviated directories to hostels (for, as they inevitably say, the 
young at heart as well as the young) pretty much all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SEAGOING HITCHHIKER'S HANDBOOK; ROAMING THE EARTH ON OTHER PEOPLE'S YACHTS 
by Greg Becker (High Adventure Publishing, $11.95 paper). If you know how to 
sail -- even the basics -- and have more time than money, says Greg Baker, you 
can hang around the harbors and marinas of the world and almost certainly get 
invited, sooner or later, to cruise off on some greater or lesser boat. He 
offers general tips, suggestions on what and where to learn before sticking out 
your nautical thumb (and neck), and a list of the aforementioned harbors and 
marinas. Bon voyage.

 Full-time students are eligible for thousands of special discounts when 
traveling, ranging from reductions on bus travel in Australia to free entrance 
to all of the national museums of Spain. Identity cards issued by individual 
schools are not always honored in foreign countries, though. The only 
internationally recognized proof of student status is the International Student 
Identity Card (ISIC) and 1995 versions of the card are now available. 
</P>
<P>
 The ISIC (pronounced "eye-zic") was created in 1968 by the ISIC Assn. (a 
network of more than 120 student organizations in 82 countries) so that 
businesses offering discounts to foreign students would not have to deal with 
the thousands of different styles of identification issued around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of ISIC have negotiated discounts on travel goods and services, 
including airline fares, rail, bus and ferry prices; discounted and free entry 
to museums, art galleries, historical sites and sites of cultural importance; 
accommodations and meals, sports and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
offered its support for the ISIC. Through cooperation with UNESCO, World 
Heritage sites, museums and galleries, as well as a wide range of cultural 
events, can now be made accessible to ISIC holders. Here's the kind of 
difference getting a student discount can make. During a recent visit to 
Vienna, I found that for students the entrance fee to the main building of the 
Kunsthistorisches Museum was reduced by nearly half to $4. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when a business does not indicate a student discount you should always 
ask if one is available; they may have discounts for local students that they 
will also offer you. Student discounts reach to the far corners of the world, 
ranging from discounted backpacker accommodations in Capetown South Africa to a 
40% reduction at the Vatican Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, discounts are available at more than 6,000 hotels in North 
America. This includes Days Inns, Econo Lodges, Comfort Inns, Scottish Inns, 
Quality Inns, Ramada Inns and Howard Johnson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Card-holders also receive a 10% discount on AT&T services, service-charge-free 
traveler's checks, a free trial month on CompuServe, a $10 American Express 
Money-Gram rebate, basic sickness and accident insurance, plus access to a 
24-hour, toll-free hot line that can provide help in case of a medical, 
financial or legal emergency while abroad.  
</P>
<P>
 The ISIC issued now will remain valid until Dec. 31, 1995. The price is $16. 
To obtain an ISIC, or a similar-styled International Teacher Identity Card 
($17) in the Los Angeles area, contact: Council Travel, 1093 Broxton Ave.,

A WORD OF ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her excellent article on the North Frisian island of Fohr ("Island 
Playground in the North Sea," Sept. 11), Eva G. Fremont translates the term 
Wattenmeer as cotton sea . There is in German the word Watte , meaning cotton , 
but it is not related to Wattenmeer or Watt , a derivative of the low German 
and Old High German wat , which means "a place in the sea low enough to wade 
through."

<P>
 By the second paragraph of Eva G. Fremont's article on the German island of 
Fohr, I wanted to scream. 
</P>
<P>
 She delightfully referred to the "Don of Canterbury" as an "off-white Scottish 
terrier." The picture of the Don clearly depicts a West Highland white terrier. 
"Westies" are not white "Scotties." Scottish terriers and West Highland white 
terriers are two completely different breeds of dog.

THEATER NOTES; RIGHT TIME FOR 'VICTIMA' AND LA RAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Latino Theatre Lab, for merly an affiliate of Los Angeles Theatre Center 
and then the Mark Taper Forum, moves into Plaza de la Raza in full force this 
week, opening a revival of the group's 1987 LATC production of "La Victima" on 
Wednesday as a fund-raiser for the campaign against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The production will kick off a year in which the Lab and the Plaza will 
explore ways to fund a permanent residency for the Lab at the Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives them a home, and it gives us more of a profile," said Lydia Lopez, 
interim managing director of Plaza de la Raza. The two organizations will share 
fund-raising efforts as well as facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez acknowledged that some of the current faculty at the Plaza "were 
nervous" about the arrival of the Lab. "They thought they would be displaced. 
Our major challenge is to make sure there is no conflict." She thinks it can be 
done, and "lately I haven't heard any rumblings." 
</P>
<P>
 When the idea of the Lab's move to the Plaza was first brought up, the idea 
was to do the first Lab production in the fall of 1995. But "La Victima," which 
explores decades of Mexican/U.S. immigration and deportation issues, "was so 
timely," Lopez said, considering the controversy around Proposition 187 -- 
which targets illegal immigrants -- on the November ballot. Most of the LATC 
cast has been reassembled for the play, which was also seen at the Plaza in 
1980 in a production by Teatro de la Esperanza, the then-Santa Barbara-based 
group that created it. 
</P>
<P>
 THE ADAS: The Ovation Awards aren't the only new competitive theater awards in 
town. The Valley Theatre League will pass out the new ADAs on Wednesday in a 
program at TV Academy Plaza Theatre in North Hollywood. There are 195 
nominations in 33 categories, covering two years, picked by a committee of 
artistic directors (hence the name -- Ar tistic Director Awards) and producers 
of San Fernando Valley theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 One representative of each member of the League votes on the nominees (except 
for his or her own shows). But unlike the Ovations, which use a computerized 
system to help insure voters have seen the nominees, the ADAs rely on an honor 
system among the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Gaynes, producer of the ADAs show, said there was no attempt to steal any 
thunder from the Ovations, which will be awarded on Nov. 14: "The closeness of 
the dates is coincidental," Gaynes said. In fact, Theatre LA, which sponsors 
the Ovations, will receive a special award at the ADA event. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no Ovations nominations went to Valley shows, and "we couldn't help 
but note that," Gaynes said. While that provides "all the more reason" for the 
ADAs, it was not part of the motivation for doing the awards; the ADAs were in 
the works long before the Ovations nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every Valley theater is represented in the nominations. Touring 
productions at Universal Amphitheatre and the two shows staged by Michael 
Arabian at CBS Studio Center during the eligibility period -- the only Valley 
shows on Actors' Equity contracts above the 99-seat level -- weren't nominated. 
Arabian's group doesn't belong to the Valley Theatre League. And while Glendale 
is often considered part of the Valley, no Glendale theaters belong to the 
League.

MUSIC & DANCE NEWS: ORCHESTRAL CONTRACTS GET A LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cariaga 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aside from artistic excellence, continuity is the critical is sue in the life 
of performing organizations. And that issue is regularly threatened when 
contracts come up for renewal. Across the nation, in recent weeks, a number of 
symphonic contracts have been renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pacific Symphony, the bottom line in a new, three-year agreement 
between the symphony association and Local 7, American Federation of Musicians, 
includes a 14.7% wage increase over the length of the contract, as well as a 
$50,000 signing bonus; additionally, the contract clarifies provisions for 
touring and substitute players. 
</P>
<P>
 At the St. Louis Symphony in Missouri, a new wrinkle in a recently ratified, 
five-year agreement between the orchestra players, represented by Local 2-197, 
and management, the Symphony Society, is the creation of a "Community 
Partnership Program" that will enhance the personal involvement of the 
musicians in the community. The contract also sets annual cost of living salary 
increases for individual players over the five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra have ratified their new contract, 
which increases base salary by 7.7% in the first of three years, and also 
increases the orchestra's pension benefit from $40,000 to $45,000 on the final 
day of the first year of the contract. Both sides, the official news release 
says, "made some adjustments in working conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Symphony and its players have agreed upon and ratified a 
contract commencing Oct. 1, 1994, through Sept. 15, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agreement restores and adds weeks of employment for the orchestra, 
with an increase in compensation each year. The contract, according to a news 
release, "expresses a major commitment from the . . . Board of Directors to the 
musicians of the orchestra and to the institution's continuing growth and de 
velopment." 
</P>
<P>
 It also provides yearly employment of 36, 37 and 38 weeks for the 81 musicians 
of the orchestra. Weekly minimums are $835, $870 and $900 in each of the next 
three seasons; included in the minimum is $45 of electronic media guarantee, 
which will enable the orchestra to continue recording projects and radio 
broadcasts. Long-term disability insurance, already in place for the symphony's 
administrative staff, has been extended to the players. 
</P>
<P>
 ANNIVERSARIES: At a special, 75th Anniversary concert Monday night in the 
Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Los Angeles Philharmonic will 
repeat its inaugural program of Oct. 24, 1919. Conducted by music director 
Esa-Pekka Salonen and former music director Zubin Mehta, that program lists 
Chabrier's "Espana," Dvorak's "New World Symphony," Liszt's "Les Preludes" and 
Weber's Overture to "Oberon." Michael York will be master of ceremonies. . . . 
On three consecutive nights, Nov. 10-12, the New York Philharmonic will observe 
the 50th anniversary of Leon Fleisher's New York debut (Nov. 4, 1944), when the 
then-16-year-old pianist from San Francisco played Brahms' D-minor Concerto. 
Now 66, and the father of five adult children, Fleisher on these occasions will 
play Ravel's Left-Hand Concerto, a highlight of the current repertory he was 
obliged to take on when, at the height of his career, in 1965, he lost the use 
of his right hand to what was later diagnosed as repetitive stress syndrome. 
During the rest of this 1994-95 season in the United States, Fleisher will play 
not only the Ravel work, but also a new left-hand concerto written for him by 
Lukas Foss, and other one-handed works by Prokofiev and Curtis-Smith.  
</P>
<P>
 BRIEFLY: Cal State Long Beach will host an open house Nov. 5 for two new 
landmarks on the East Long Beach campus: the Pyramid Event Center and the 
Carpenter Performing Arts Center. Both facilities will be open for public tours 
from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. . . . . Charles McNeal, 33, an instructor at San 
Francisco Ballet, has been honored with the Bernard Osher Cultural Award of the 
Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco, a prize of $10,000, as "an unsung 
hero in the field of culture and the arts." McNeal has worked for 14 years, 
developing and implementing community outreach and educational programs of S. 
F. . . . A former principal pianist and assistant conductor at L.A. Music 
Center Opera, Grant Gershon was recently named the conducting assistant at the 
Los Angeles Philharmonic. According to music director Esa-Pekka Salonen, 
Gershon will help to program the orchestra's neighborhood and educational 
concerts, and act as understudy to the music director and to guest conductors. 
He will also be associate conductor in the co-production of Debussy's "Pelleas 
et Melisande," in February.*

 TCHAIKOVSKY: BARRY DOUGLAS, piano, London Symphony, Philharmonia Orchestra, 
Leonard Slatkin, conductor for -- Piano Concerto No. 1; Concert Fantasy. RCA 
Victor Red Seal 09026 61632-2.Piano Concerto No. 2; Piano Concerto No. 3. RCA 
Victor Red Seal 09026 61633-2. These two discs, issued separately, comprise 
handsome reminders of the qualities that made Douglas the first Western winner 
of the Tchaikovsky Competition since 1958. Each work is given a powerful and 
stylish performance -- technically impressive and remarkably refined. 
Pristinely partnered by the London Symphony, the Belfast-born pianist recorded 
-- and RCA originally released -- the First Concerto in 1986, the year he took 
the gold, in Moscow. The other, less familiar offerings -- all in collaboration 
with the Philharmonia -- followed in 1991 and 1992. The forces maintain a 
unanimity in their approach -- personable, moving, flashy, eminently romantic, 
but never descending into bombast. Susan Bliss

ART NOTES: SAN DIEGO ENTERS THE DIGITAL AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Muchnic, Suzanne Muchnic is The Times' art writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Diego Museum of Art will join the digital age on Wednesday with a 
public unveiling of its Interactive Multimedia Art Gallery Explorer (IMAGE) 
Gallery. Visitors to the new first-floor installation will find a series of 
information systems equipped with Macintosh Power PCs that offer easy access to 
300 works in the museum's collection. 
</P>
<P>
 As is typical of interactive programs that are moving into art museums all 
across the nation, from the Minneapolis Institute of Arts to the Seattle Art 
Museum, no computer expertise is required to use IMAGE Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 By merely touching the screen, visitors can conduct research on artists, see 
magnified details of artworks, determine the size of a work compared to a human 
figure, hear foreign names pronounced, create personal tours of the museum and 
print maps of their routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all people know about art is that they like flowers, they can call up that 
subject and learn something about 17th-Century Dutch still-life painting," says 
Holly Witchy, SDMA's associate curator of European art and supervisor of the 
project. "This offers people an opportunity to learn about things that they 
themselves choose." 
</P>
<P>
 To allay curators' fears that visitors will be so fascinated with the 
computers, they will ignore the actual art, IMAGE Gallery "is completely driven 
by making you want to go upstairs to look at the art," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-hundred artworks in the program were selected by curators. The remaining 
100 were chosen for their educational value and popularity. Other pieces will 
be added in the future, Witchy says. 
</P>
<P>
 IMAGE Gallery was conceived when museum trustee Maurice C. Kaplan saw Micro 
Gallery at London's National Gallery of Art and offered to help finance a 
similar interactive computer guide at the San Diego museum. The Getty Grant 
Program awarded $100,000 to the project, through a program that aims to enhance 
the role of art museums in public education. The software was developed by 
Cognitive Applications Ltd., creator of London's Micro Gallery and a similar 
system that's in the works at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 VITAL SIGNS: As Bergamot Station continues to attract crowds to the sprawling 
new art complex in Santa Monica, gallery life goes on in West Hollywood. Among 
this week's happenings, dealer Louis Stern -- who closed his Beverly Hills 
gallery last spring -- is hosting his first show in a space he now shares with 
the Jan Abrams Gallery. The exhibition, opening Wednesday, features 
surrealistic paintings by Richard Baker. Stern is also planning an exhibition 
of drawings, "The Classical Line," to be curated by Josine Ianco Starrels. 
Maintaining two galleries under one roof, Stern and Abrams will present 
separate exhibitions on an alternating schedule, but may collaborate in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other galleries have openings scheduled in the neighborhood on Saturday: 
"Michael Goldberg Paintings: 1951-1961" at the Manny Silverman Gallery, "Tim 
Burton: The Museum of Unnatural History" at Thomas Solomon's Garage, and "Jay 
DeFeo: Drawings and Photo Collages From the 1970s" and "George Herms: Project 
X" at the Kohn Turner Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohn Turner will also show a sampling of artists' books from Lapis Press, a 
Venice-based book publishing company owned by artist Sam Francis and directed 
by Robert Shapazian. The press recently won New York Art Directors awards for 
art direction and book design -- the latest of 20 major design awards claimed 
by Lapis. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Louis Stern's brother, a specialist in American art from 1890 
through World War II, is moving his gallery from Encino to West Hollywood. 
George Stern is planning to launch his new space, at 8920 Melrose Ave., around 
the first of November with a show of early California Impressionism. His second 
exhibition, slated to open Dec. 3, will feature contemporary paintings by Santa 
Barbara artist John Comer. 
</P>
<P>
 RARE ADDITION: A bound album of drawings by French neoclassical painter 
Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) is the latest acquisition of the Getty Center 
for the History of Art and the Humanities. Purchased at an undisclosed price, 
the rare work -- one of 12 similar albums, only five of which remain intact -- 
contains 98 drawings made in Italy and pasted into a bound volume. Subjects 
include antique sculptures and reliefs in Roman collections, studies of Old 
Master artworks, Italian landscapes and views of Rome. David made most of the 
drawings during his first sojourn in Italy, in 1775-81 as a recipient of the 
Prix de Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 MANNA FROM THE IMS: Five Southern California art museums have received grants 
for general operating expenses from the Institute of Museum Services, an 
independent branch of the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities. The 
Armory Center for the Arts and the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena, the Bowers 
Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana and the University Art Museum at UC Santa 
Barbara were awarded $112,500 each, while the Santa Monica Museum of Art 
received $65,000. In another round of IMS grants, designated for conservation 
projects, UCLA's Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts won $5,275 to treat 13 
prints by Henri Matisse. 
</P>
<P>
 NORTON CURATORS: The Peter Norton Foundation has awarded its 1994 Curator's 
Grants to Amada Cruz of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington 
and Susan Krane of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. The Los Angeles-based 
foundation presents the $50,000 grants annually to be used for the acquisition 
of contemporary art by the institutions that employ the winning curators. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, a 1983 graduate of New York University, has been associate curator at 
the Hirshhorn since 1989. She co-organized the traveling exhibition "Felix 
Gonzalez-Torres," which appeared at Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Krane, who received a master's degree in art from Columbia University in 1978, 
has organized a variety of exhibitions, including "Equal Rights and Justice" 
(1994), "Max Weber: The Cubist Decade, 1910-1920" (1992) and "Lynda Benglis: 
Dual Natures" (1991).*

POP EYE: THE BOOK ON 'VITALOGY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder bought an old book on health and philosophy he 
had no idea that it could ultimately cost the band $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the price that Pearl Jam could end up paying in order to have its new 
album, "Vitalogy," named after and housed in a package designed to resemble 
that turn-of-the-century book. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual manufacturing cost is only about 52 cents per unit more than a 
regular CD package, but Pearl Jam didn't want to pass that expense on to record 
buyers and struck a deal with its label, Epic Records, to split the extra 
charges. With the new album expected to sell as well as the band's 1993 "Vs." 
(5 million to date) or the 1991 debut "Ten" (8 million), that means the costs 
could mount to . . . well, you can do the math. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than the usual plastic CD jewel box, the album will come in a book 
containing a 36-page collection of lyrics, photos and notes, some drawn 
directly from the book that Vedder bought. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've woven in their lyrics, their notes and even X-rays with things from 
the old book for this incredible conglomerate," says Dan Beck, the Epic product 
manager who is overseeing the packaging.  
</P>
<P>
 But is it worth the expense? 
</P>
<P>
 "The band feels strongly about giving people a package that means something 
instead of just a regular plastic jewel box," says Pearl Jam manager Kelly 
Curtis. "It's kind of like albums used to be, definitely something of value." 
</P>
<P>
 The CD and cassette versions will be in stores on Dec. 6, pushed back a few 
weeks from original plans to make sure that enough of the packages could be in 
stock to meet demand. But a limited run of vinyl versions -- probably about 
50,000 -- will be released Nov. 22. "Vs." was also released on vinyl before the 
CD version. 
</P>
<P>
 And there will be another release previewing the album: Pearl Jam's first-ever 
U.S. commercial single, due Nov. 8, featuring the song "Spin the Black Circle" 
with a B-side of "Tremor Christ." 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just always against the idea of a 'hit single,' " says Curtis. "But 
singles were released in Europe and the band felt bad about fans here paying 
high prices for the imports, so they decided to release them here." Steve 
Hochman

 MORE PEARLS: Some passages in the "Vitalogy" book used by Pearl Jam in its 
album packaging may draw extra attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a combination of things that are funny and maybe some things that 
were ahead of their time -- including one thing from the old book saying that 
the biggest cause of death for healthy young men is 'self-pollution,' " says 
Beck. 
</P>
<P>
 A reference to fellow Seattle-rocker Kurt Cobain's drug use and suicide, which 
had a deep effect on Pearl Jam?  
</P>
<P>
 Curtis refuses to speculate on whether such elements have any "hidden" 
meanings and adds that none of the songs on the album are to his knowledge 
specifically about Cobain.  
</P>
<P>
 Curtis does say that there are hopes for a concert tour after New Year's, 
though no replacement has been chosen for fired drummer Dave Abruzzede. Steve

 POP SLAVERY: Is the former Prince trying to tell us -- and Warner Bros. 
Records -- something by having the word slave written on his face in the video 
for the as-yet-unreleased song "Dolphin"? Representatives for the Symbol Man 
say he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his spokesman insists that the ex-Prince is not trying to get out of 
his multimillion-dollar deal with Warner Bros., he's upset about his 
relationship with the company, which hasn't been able to make his recent album, 
"Come," a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently his plan is to use old, unreleased recordings to deliver the four 
remaining albums called for on his mega-deal. First up will be the 
much-bootlegged "Black Album," which was originally planned for a 1988 release 
but was pulled in favor of "Lovesexy." This is scheduled for a Nov. 22 release 
now, replacing the new album "The Gold Experience," which Symbol Man's 
representative now says may never be released. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither representatives of the artist nor Warner Bros. would comment on the 
contract, but insiders speculate that the singer apparently feels that music 
recorded after he changed his name to the symbol last year is not subject to 
the Warner deal he signed as Prince. Steve Hochman

 CIVIL WRONG: The term bomb is a positive one in current street slang, but last 
week's "Countdown to Eternity" concert honoring the civil rights struggle was a 
bomb in the negative sense. Instead of the 10,000 people promoters hoped would 
come to the outdoor Watts festival featuring Fishbone, MC Lyte, Solomon Burke 
and the Watts Prophets, only 200 showed up -- many of them members of the press 
who didn't have to pay the $15 for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Kevin Morrow, the talent booker for the House of Blues, which 
co-sponsored the event with the Watts Labor Community Action Committee, says 
plans are already being discussed for another attempt next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of festivals start out like that when you're trying to get sponsorships 
and get the word out in the community, and this is going to be a building 
process," says Morrow. "I was really disappointed at first, but after 30 years 
of negative press on Watts, it's just going to take a few years." Heidi 
Siegmund

 'Duets III "? Yes, though the second Frank Sinatra album pairing him with 
other singers -- including Neil Diamond, Willie Nelson, Chrissie Hynde and 
Linda Ronstadt -- won't be out until next month, plans are already being made 
for a third volume. Sinatra's representatives won't confirm it, but speculation 
is centering on Axl Rose (who had been rumored as part of "Duets II") and opera 
star Luciano Pavarotti as top candidates to duet with Ol' Blue Eyes in the next 
round. . . .

EVOLUTION OR REVOLUTION FOR THE SIZZLING SONORAN DESERT; SOUTHWEST: SUMMER HEAT 
NEARS 200 DEGREES AT GROUND LEVEL. CLIMATE AND ISOLATION HISTORICALLY HAVE 
PROTECTED IT, BUT NAFTA IS LIKELY TO CHANGE THAT. 'THIS REGION IS GOING TO BE 
EITHER FORMALLY PROTECTED OR COMMERCIALLY DEVELOPED,' ONE EXPERT SAYS.

 The pinacate beetle is black and scabrous. And nasty. If threatened, it hoists 
up its backside and emits an odor. It gave its name to an equally black, 
scabrous and nasty landscape -- the volcanic field of cinder cones and lava 
debris called the Pinacate -- the dark heart of the Sonoran Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer heat nears 200 degrees at ground level. The desert is thick with things 
that stink, prick, bite, hook or flagellate -- things armed and dangerous. 
Cacti, rattlesnakes, scorpions. Sun. Rock and earth. The air, its ferocious 
clarity defining all things in razor edges like a comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sonoran spreads evenly between Mexico and the United States. It yokes the 
Gulf of California at the delta of the Colorado River and spills down the 
bone-like peninsula of Baja California. It covers parts of California and 
Arizona, including Yuma, Phoenix and Tucson, as well as the Mexican state of 
Sonora and its rawboned boom town capital, Hermosillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert has always been a place to avoid or to overcome. Humans have left 
their layers like river sediments: ancient canal builders, nomadic Indians, 
Spanish missionaries, Yankee cattlemen and imperialists, cold warriors, cactus 
huggers, snowbirds. Many of them, too, were prickly, armed and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 I spent six weeks traveling across this often bizarre landscape, seeing how 
the desert absorbed those layers and wondering how it would respond to the 
next. With population growth pushing land-use and water issues and with the 
passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the desert will change, and 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This region is going to be either formally protected or commercially 
developed," said Luther Propst, director of the Sonoran Institute, a 
conservation and land-protection group in Tucson. "Isolation and aridity are 
not going to protect it for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the Sonoran still seems vast and untrampled. One of the 
largest intact arid ecosystems in the world, it shelters endangered animals 
such as the Sonoran pronghorn and the lesser long-nosed bat. And because it has 
rainy seasons in both summer and winter, the Sonoran is the world's most 
botanically diverse desert, with more than 2,500 species of plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Among a menagerie of plants that seems straight from Dr. Seuss is the saguaro 
cactus, the enduring symbol of Arizona that is unique to the Sonoran and 
reaches heights of 50 feet, weighs tons and lives as long as 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the fragile balance of life and death in the desert seems irrelevant 
in Phoenix, where I began my trip. The city grandly ignores the lesson of the 
plants, that living things cannot clump together on land with little water. 
</P>
<P>
 As more people pour into the Sunbelt, 30% of the water in central and southern 
Arizona is imported through the Central Arizona Project, a diversion of the 
Colorado River. Phoenix continues to mutate into something like Southern 
California, an artificial land of green lawns and shade trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's other urban pillar, Tucson, seems more in tune with the desert and 
proudly uses local trees and plants to landscape yards and parks. But Tucson 
also relies on the project's water, and both cities are rapidly turning desert 
into suburban tracts and golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 I pulled out of Tucson one spring morning in a four-wheel-drive vehicle, 
heading for the empty hinterland. About 60 miles west, the Papago Indian 
Reservation -- 2.5 million acres flattened against the Mexican border -- is 
home to some 6,000 Papago, or Tohono O'odham, the "desert people." 
</P>
<P>
 The reservation is the country's second largest, next to the Navajo, but is 
only the shrunken core of the ancestral homeland. The Tohono O'odham no longer 
farm, and only some have been successful at cattle ranching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has ever figured out a nice way, a proper way, to take somebody's land 
away from him," said retired University of Arizona anthropologist Bernard 
Fontana. "This will be on the national conscience forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora today is a rugged livestock culture of cattle ranches, horse races, 
straw hats and brass belt buckles. When I arrived in Cucurpe, an isolated 
village on the San Miguel River, I found mestizo farmer-ranchers -- people of 
mixed Spanish-Indian heritage -- living almost as they did 200 years ago, in a 
tough but graceful self-subsistence. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1880s, American cattle had already overgrazed the river valleys of 
southern Arizona, taken from Mexico 30 years earlier. The border bristled with 
ruffians and desperadoes, chased by gun-totin' sheriffs across the saguaro 
deserts of a thousand Western movies to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, illegal immigrants and drug smugglers push north across the border, 
fearing the law; tourists sally south, fearing "banditos" and the drinking 
water. Thousands of undocumented workers filter across from Mexico each week. 
</P>
<P>
 A 2.7 million-acre reserve, the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range, provides 
the military with an immense sandbox for training. Nearly 200 missions a day 
fly over the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that military stewardship has probably preserved the desert 
better than others might have, by severely limiting public access. Most 
defenders of the desert fear businessmen more than colonels. 
</P>
<P>
 West of the Mexican border town of Sonoyta is the desolate Pinacate, where 
NASA astronauts once trained for their mission to the moon. Nominally a Mexican 
national park, El Pinacate has been protected only by its isolation. No one 
lives here; no rangers control access or enforce rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists on both sides of the border hope to eventually combine the 
Mexican park with Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and Cabeza Prieta 
National Wildlife Refuge in the United States. It would then be an 
international biosphere reserve, part of a system of protected land sponsored 
by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Sonoran to survive the latest layer of development, it will need the 
wisdom and goodwill of two nations and at least three cultures.

NUCLEAR FUEL TOWN NOT EVEN A DOT ON MAP; COLORADO: SOON, BULLDOZERS WILL SCRAPE 
URAVAN OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. WHY? THOSE RADIOACTIVE TAILINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT WELLER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This town supplied the uranium that produced the bombs that ended World War II 
and fueled the Cold War nuclear arsenal. But the three generations that grew up 
here remember it only as a great place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, bulldozers will scrape the former community of 1,000 off the face of the 
Earth. Road maps no longer show it. ZIP code 81436 has been reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, kids used to play in the radioactive tailings from the uranium mines at 
the remote sandstone-rimmed spot on the San Miguel River. But now, despite what 
the state considers hazardous, all that lingers in the air is regret and new 
meaning to the phrase, "You can't go home again." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real sad for me. I can't feature it without those houses. I think we 
were the first family to move there (in 1936)," said Shirley Vancil. Three of 
her four children were born there. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Espinoza, who moved to Uravan in 1957 after service in the Navy, called 
it "a beautiful home with down-to-earth people. Most kids go home to see their 
hometown. Our kids can't do that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Debby Ackerson Jackson experiences that deprivation first-hand. "Even after we 
left, we knew we could go back," she said. "Now it's like they're trying to 
make it extinct." Jackson was born in Uravan in 1954 -- one of several hundred 
born in the Union Carbide mill town. 
</P>
<P>
 The last residents left in the late 1980s, half a century after Vancil's 
family settled here. Today, some former Uravan residents and others are 
lobbying to save bits and pieces of the ghost town. The old boardinghouse may 
qualify as a national historic site. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recreation hall-church, the commissary, the clinic and the mill 
buildings are being knocked down. Already gone are the houses of A, B and C 
blocks, their gardens and fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of Colorado is requiring UMETCO, the Union Carbide subsidiary 
responsible for the old company town, to clean it up, said Don Simpson, the 
state employee responsible for radiation control. That means trucking its 
low-level radioactive tailings to the rim above Uravan and burying it. 
</P>
<P>
 Billions of dollars already have been spent moving radioactive tailings away 
from former mining centers across the country. Some of those tailings may be 
brought here. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Geno Saccamanno, a pathologist in Grand Junction who has studied 
uranium-related cancer cases for four decades, said much of the tailing removal 
was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Saccamanno said work in uranium mines was deadly, particularly because most 
miners smoked. But most of Uravan's population was employed by the mill, not in 
the mines. Studies found normal cancer rates among the Uravan population. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said state and federal agencies had no choice on Uravan. "The 
international community says there is no safe level for exposure to 
radioactivity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I read about them removing the tailings, I think it's a waste of 
time. We don't glow in the dark, and we used to jump and roll in the tailings. 
We'd get a mouthful. Even if they'd told us not to, we'd have done it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom used tailings in her garden and we had the best garden in town. She 
grew 1,000 varieties of irises," Jackson added. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said it is hard to underestimate the fear the word radioactivity 
generates. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists who drive down 60 miles on the winding road through narrow Unaweep 
Canyon from Grand Junction sometimes stop here to ask cleanup crews if everyone 
who lived here died. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the uranium on 180,000-square-mile Colorado Plateau started with 
the Ute Indians. They used the soft, yellow carnotite ore found on the surface 
to paint their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorized visitors enter with escorts. Step into some of the remaining 
buildings and it's like entering the Twilight Zone. A bottle labeled "yellow 
cake" sat on the counter of one dark and empty building. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospectors began scouring the earth for uranium at the turn of the century 
after Marie Curie discovered radium in uranium ore samples. Madame Curie 
herself visited the region to look at samples. For a time, it was worth 
$120,000 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 The market later collapsed. Uravan itself was set up primarily to mine 
vanadium, used in the manufacture of steel. The town's name is a combination of 
uranium and vanadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanadium tailings became an important source of uranium for the Manhattan 
Project during World War II. Robert Sullenberger helped build a 
uranium-processing mill for the U.S. Army across the river from the vanadium 
mill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullenberger has no regrets about his involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It saved a lot of lives," he said. "I recall some Japanese tourists stopping 
outside Uravan. I restrained myself from telling them this is where the bombs 
came from that we dropped on your country." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it was one of the most secret operations in U.S. history, Uravan's own 
remoteness made most security measures superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
 The town got a scare once when an errant B-17 was mistaken for a Japanese 
bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest security breach was when game wardens burst in driving a green 
Plymouth in search of mill employees shooting deer out of season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War triggered a frantic search for uranium. Ten thousand people, on 
foot, Jeeps and by helicopters, tramped the Colorado Plateau. 
</P>
<P>
 Uravan boomed again. 
</P>
<P>
 Its facilities included a clinic, two swimming pools, a baseball field, 
commissary and grade school. The company provided a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good place to grow up and I thought the company was good to us," 
Jackson said. "On Saturday nights, we roller-skated, and Sunday morning, they 
turned it (the building) into a church. It was a good place to raise kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could raise mine here." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 former residents showed up at an annual reunion this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancil said, "We didn't need a radio because the ones who moved to Uravan were 
so friendly. We'd all congregate in our yards. We would play until 9 p.m. and 
then we'd get into bed." 
</P>
<P>
 The uranium market crashed in 1981 after the nuclear accident at Three Mile 
Island cooled the nation's hunger for nuclear power. Other countries were 
producing uranium cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Without jobs, most residents had left by 1984.

HIDDEN COSTS COME TO SURFACE AS AGRICULTURISTS CURTAIL USE OF PESTICIDES 
</P>

 Pesticides have come under increasing question from gardeners and 
agriculturists in recent years. But is there a point of no return to their 
curtailment or elimination? 
</P>
<P>
 California Agriculture, published by the University of California's division 
of agriculture and natural resources, devotes much of its May-June edition to 
fascinating questions raised by the scheduled, nationwide removal by the year 
2001 of methyl bromide, a soil fumigant widely used in this country since the 
1930s.

 It is being phased out under provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act regarding 
ozone-depleting substances. No single alternative is available. A U.S. 
Department of Agriculture economic research report earlier this year estimated 
its removal will cost consumers and growers about $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank G. Zalon, director of the university's integrated pest management 
program, calls the phaseout "an example of the complex challenges that come 
with pesticide regulation" and says California agriculture is undergoing an 
evolution of historic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pesticides are not a single group of chemicals but a variety of materials that 
have a common use -- to control pests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Household bleach and chlorine become pesticides when they are used to kill 
organisms around our homes or in industry. Minerals such as sulfur and copper 
and naturally occurring plant derivatives such as pyrethrum become pesticides 
when they are used to control plant diseases or insects," Zalon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Policies formed during the methyl bromide debate, he contends, will set 
precedents for all regulatory actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "While few would question the need for restricting the use of materials known 
to have serious environmental or health impact, research published in the 
journal Science earlier this year raises questions about the impact of 
grower-used methyl bromide." 
</P>
<P>
 That is because there is little data available to estimate how much methyl 
bromide escapes into the atmosphere during and after agriculture fumigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major dilemma is a natural phenomenon known as the "replant problem," 
which occurs worldwide to varying degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The university's Michael V. McKenry, Tom Buzo, Joe Kretsch, Stephanie Kaku, 
Elaine Otomo, Rulon Ashcroft, Arthur H. Lange and Kathleen Kelley describe it 
this way in their research: 
</P>
<P>
 "Scientists cannot entirely explain the powerful benefit of fumigating soil 
before replanting perennial crops. The doubling of plant growth in the years 
that follow is only partly accounted for by the elimination of plant pathogens, 
nematodes and insects." 
</P>
<P>
 They say the "replant problem" is illustrated when soil is collected from 
anywhere along an old orchard or vineyard floor and placed in a pot in a 
greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any woody perennial placed in it will not grow as well as if it had been 
planted in soil that had never been in an orchard or vineyard," they report. 
</P>
<P>
 They also found that fumigants are capable of destroying most life stages of 
soil-dwelling organisms, as well as infected roots which otherwise can remain 
alive in soil for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many plants do not develop adequate root systems in such soil. Marigolds 
(Tagetes species) provide an example of potential solutions. They help because 
they are antagonistic to tiny soil insects known as nematodes and are grown to 
discourage them. Extracts of marigold also are used as a soil drench. 
</P>
<P>
 Other non-chemical possibilities include crop rotation, plowing of land but 
leaving it unplanted (fallowing) and using the sun's heat to sterilize soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Home gardeners seldom use methyl bromide because it requires extreme caution. 
It is used routinely, however, by most commercial plant growers.

COLLECTION AGENCIES TARGET DEADBEAT MOMS, DADS; CHILD SUPPORT: ENTREPRENEURS 
STEP IN WHERE GOVERNMENT FAILS TO TREAD. SOME FIRMS BOAST OF HIGH SUCCESS 
RATES; OTHERS COMPLAIN THAT BUREAUCRATS WON'T COOPERATE. 
</P>

<P>
 Rebecca Morrick of Grand Junction, Colo., grew so frustrated over her husband 
not paying support for their three children that she set up her own collection 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In business less than a year, her company -- called Trak-Ex -- is working on 
$1 million in collections, taking a 25% commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Now when a deadbeat dad tells her the check is in the mail, "It's in the 
mail," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do it to help the mothers," Morrick said. "I've been there and I know they 
need help. My real goal is to mend relationships. If these men are paying, 
maybe they'll see their children and be the father their children need." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Drake of San Antonio, Tex., who believes he "gave birth to the 
industry" in 1988, says his Children's Support Services gets more than 50% of 
the money it goes after. 
</P>
<P>
 Government agencies were only able to collect from deadbeat parents 19% of the 
time in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "They create excellent laws, but they don't use them," Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress passed a law in 1992 making it a federal crime to cross state lines 
to avoid paying child support, but a recent check showed only five people had 
been prosecuted. An estimated $14 billion is owed to 9 million children, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Private companies have moved in to fill the gap. Some have slick recordings on 
800 numbers promising "extraordinarily high success" rates in "each and every 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 At least two states, Mississippi and Utah, have hired private agencies to help 
them collect. California has authorized collection agencies to cross state 
lines to garnishee the earnings of delinquent parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government can't do everything. We could use their help," said Kathy Stumm, 
director of Colorado's Child Support Enforcement Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Casey Hoffman, a former Texas assistant attorney general and now 
president of Child Support Enforcement of Austin, says the government should 
focus on welfare cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incredible as it may sound, Ivana Trump would be eligible for free services 
in 35 of the 50 states and pay only a token fee in the other 15," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake says there are 49 companies in a national association of companies that 
collect child support at offices in 29 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Most require a small application fee, ranging from $25 to $35, and charge a 
25% commission if they are successful. The agencies don't take welfare cases 
because money collected would be taken by the states to recover welfare costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators don't like to talk in detail about how they get their 
information, speaking only in general terms about having access to databases, 
such credit reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the time you get a lot of information from relatives and neighbors," 
Morrick said. She might call and ask what they see in the deadbeat's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times the deadbeats are there for the picking if local authorities will 
budge from their offices. She recently called police in Michigan about a 
deadbeat, giving them his address. He was in jail within 24 hours, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of her clients, like Jesse Opp of Wichita, Kan., live in other states. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did a really good job," Opp said. "I've finally gotten somewhere. He was 
years behind. I had been trying to go through the courts but they are so 
backlogged it takes them a year to even get going." 
</P>
<P>
 Her present husband, Roger, now is using Morrick to try to recover money owed 
by his previous wife for running up their credit cards when they divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Price, who has been in the collection agency business in Casper, Wyo., for 
25 years and in child-support collections for three, doesn't believe private 
agencies will eliminate the problem. He says he has had so much trouble getting 
cooperation from authorities that he no longer solicits new child-support 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake is more optimistic. "We've just had a record-breaking month," he said.

1ST TOXIC-FREE APARTMENTS IN U.S. NEAR; ENVIRONMENT: FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED 
HOUSING COMPLEX DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH CHEMICAL SENSITIVITIES IS IN SAN 
RAFAEL, CALIF. OCCUPANCY IS SET FOR NOV. 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine living in an apartment where you can't wear cologne or perfume, where 
the managers must approve which cleansers you can use. And you're asked to keep 
windows closed when you cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound a bit tyrannical? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, for people with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity-Environmental Illness, 
it sounds like paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I live, all the windows are taped up, curtains closed, because of all 
the toxics that are right outside my door. It's not fun," said Jane Herman, a 
San Francisco resident who has MCS-EI. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman is on the board of Ecology House, a nonprofit organization that will 
manage the nation's first federally subsidized apartment complex designed for 
people with chemical sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Each one-bedroom unit in the 11-unit complex comes with a high-powered 
ventilation system, concrete and tile floors, metal kitchen cabinets and no 
fluorescent lights. 
</P>
<P>
 If it sounds a bit sterile, that's the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "There won't be any roses or gardenias in the courtyard," said Katie 
Crecelius, a development consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 The laundry room has three dryers and washers, one of which is reserved for 
using only baking soda to clean clothes. New furniture, recently dry-cleaned 
clothes or other smelly items can be placed in a special room where residents 
can air out their belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the driveway and parking lot are downwind, minimizing the amount of 
exhaust exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people with MCS-EI must use baking soda to clean everything from their 
car to clothes; some have wrapped their walls and cabinets with aluminum foil 
to prevent particles from wafting through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the $1.8-million Ecology House, residents will be able to save their 
foil for covering leftovers. Outside stairwells are concrete; a special vapor 
barrier sheeting lines ceilings and walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 100 applications have been received for the complex, which will 
probably be fully occupied by Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 MCS-EI has long been controversial. Experts have disagreed whether it is a 
psychological condition or a true medical disability. 
</P>
<P>
 What has puzzled doctors is that each person has different reactions to 
different chemicals. It is unclear how many people have the affliction, but 
some researchers and advocates estimate that about 15% of the U.S. population 
is prone to it. 
</P>
<P>
 In some extreme cases, just a whiff of garlic or perfume or sitting near 
electrical appliances can be temporarily paralyzing. For others, smelling 
ammonia, roses, shampoo or a new carpet can cause what appears to be a drunken 
stupor. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Molloy, 45, became ill in 1981. Her throat and nasal passages would 
swell closed when she was around cigarette smoke, cleansers and many foods. For 
a year, she ate only brown rice and, occasionally, Japanese azuki beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she lugs around an oxygen tank to most places. "You feel like you're on 
the wrong planet," said Molloy, who was instrumental in creating Ecology House. 
</P>
<P>
 Her condition has forced her to move to Snowflake, Ariz., a high desert town 
where the air is cleaner than it is in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, doctors believed that MCS-EI was a psychological condition 
resulting from emotional disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 But within the past few years Social Security, the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development and other federal agencies have recognized it as a 
disability. Scientists are investigating evidence that MCS-EI is caused by 
acute chemical exposure that can weaken the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a chemical world. Once people become sensitive, anything can set 
them off," said Nicolas Ashford, an MIT professor. "The problem is that 
probably the brain has been poisoned," he said. "If there is to be a reversal 
of the problem, the brain has to be freed of the assault of chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
 And while Molloy dreams of chemical-free world, she works on the reality of 
creating safe housing like Ecology House. "Having to turn people away is going 
to be such a heartbreaker," she said.

HILL A THRILL FOR PISTONS; PRO BASKETBALL: DETROIT'S NO. 1 DRAFT CHOICE 
FOLLOWED FATHER CALVIN HILL'S WORK ETHIC AND WENT ON TO BECOME A THREE-TIME 
ALL-AMERICAN AT DUKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The late-summer sun burns down on a father and son playing tennis behind a 
high school. They can hear the crash of pads from football practice across the 
way. Two-a-days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time next year, you'll be over there, going through that with them," the 
father says to his son, a tall eighth grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not me," the son replies. "I'll be over there, in the air-conditioned gym, 
shooting baskets." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Hill smiles as he tells the story. It was at that exact moment, he 
says, that he knew he had a very wise son. Grant Hill has that effect on 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The father was an NFL running back for the Dallas Cowboys. The son saw what a 
terrible price Calvin Hill paid with his body. He knew even then that football 
wasn't for him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grant Hill did like the way his father went about his work. Following that 
example, he became a three-time basketball All-American at Duke, leading the 
Blue Devils to a pair of NCAA championships, and the Detroit Pistons made him 
the third overall pick in this year's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned a lot from him," Grant Hill says of his father. "It's not always 
easy being the son of a professional athlete. But it's been very good. I've 
enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Dallas Mavericks took Jason Kidd with the No. 2 pick in the draft, 
the way was cleared for the Pistons to select Hill. Pistons general manager 
Billy McKinney wept. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney was reminded of that a few months later, after signing Hill to an 
eight-year contract worth $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had to write the check to pay this young man, you'd cry, too," 
McKinney says. "But he's everything we hoped he would be. Grant Hill is the 
whole package." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-foot-8 and 225 pounds, Hill is a superb athlete who has mastered all the 
fundamental skills and should blossom in the wide-open NBA game. He has an 
explosive first step and the intelligence to play solid defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man is the truth," veteran Joe Dumars says. "He explodes to the basket, 
and he has control. He has incredible control in his ability to get to the 
basket. There's only one other guy I've seen do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan? 
</P>
<P>
 Dumars face breaks into a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening tip of the Pistons' first exhibition game, Dumars spotted 
Hill flying in on the right wing. He lofted an alley-oop pass over the rim and 
Hill soared high and slammed the ball down through the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was just four seconds old, yet Hill was already at ease as a 
professional basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I saw the first move he made, I knew he was for real," Dumars says. "A 
lot of nights, he will be a flat-out go-to guy. You don't see many guys his 
size with that kind of ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say Hill doesn't have a lot to learn. The next night, in 
another exhibition game, Charles Barkley had 26 points and 11 rebounds as the 
Phoenix Suns routed the Pistons 142-121. The rookie took notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned something about losing," Hill says. "It's no fun at all. That's the 
first time I've ever lost a game by more than double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected we'd compete with them and have a chance of winning. I never 
expected we'd get blown out like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than get dejected as some rookies might, Hill turns each practice and 
each exhibition game into a learning experience. If the lane is open, he 
drives. If it's not, he stops and shoots a jumper. He takes what's there. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet what coach Don Chaney likes most are Hill's defense and ability to move 
without the ball. Both are rare in rookies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a hell of a defender," Chaney says. "He has great anticipation. He makes 
it happen. I think his defense is so much ahead of the rest of his game." 
</P>
<P>
 The thing that everybody seems to like about Grant Hill is the quality that 
made him a favorite tennis partner of his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's unique in his own way," Dumars says. "If he was the No. 3 draft pick and 
a jerk, I would not be saying these things."

CARVING HIS OWN LEGACY; TERRY BOWDEN GETS OUT OF THE GATE WITH A RECORD 18 
STRAIGHT VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Bowden spoke with his father, Bobby, twice last week: once after faxing 
him the game plan two days before Auburn was to play then-top-ranked Florida in 
Gainesville and again on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 During halftime of his team's 36-33 upset win, the younger Bowden telephoned 
the family's home in Tallahassee. Bobby Bowden, whose Florida State team was 
off last week, had watched the Tigers take a 22-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called him from the locker room," the younger Bowden recalled Tuesday, "and 
he told me to keep doing what we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 What Terry Bowden has done since being hired to replace Pat Dye in December 
1992 is not only remarkable, but also unprecedented in Division I-A college 
football history. Taking over a program that was headed for two years of NCAA 
sanctions, Bowden has won 18 straight without losing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Bowden has broken the NCAA record of 11 straight victories to 
start a career, set by former Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer, whose Sooners went 
27-0-2 before losing. Bowden's most recent win also broke the Auburn school 
record of 17 straight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to be honest with you, I have yet to feel any pressure as a coach 
because of the streak," said Bowden, 38. "It's our streak, it's not somebody 
else's. If you carried on someone else's streak, then maybe you'd feel the 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing is that it's a great local streak. It's not like it's 
approaching any national record and we're on the front page every day. Last 
week's game against the No. 1 team in the country was only on regional 
television. I think the biggest pressure is going to come now that we've beaten 
the No. 1 team." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Auburn's winning streak could be one of the most obscure ever, 
accomplished with little fanfare until last weekend. Though the sanctions that 
included no television appearances last year and no bowl games last year and 
this year likely will prevent the Tigers from being ranked No. 1 in the 
Associated Press poll -- they only went from sixth to fourth after beating the 
Gators -- it hasn't hurt Bowden's growing reputation as one of the country's 
best coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden's debut season, in which the Tigers came from behind eight times to 
win, helped silence the critics who believed he was hired more for his 
bloodlines and marquee value than his resume. Many of those were former Dye 
supporters who felt the longtime Auburn coach resigned unnecessarily, despite a 
laundry list of NCAA violations involving Dye's assistants and the team's 
boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we hired Terry, I got a number of calls from people who thought we were 
out of our minds," said Mike Lude, the now-retired Auburn athletic director. 
"But after we started winning, some of the same people called me to say what a 
genius I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Lude, a former coach at Colorado State and athletic director at the University 
of Washington, said that Bowden's upbringing and his father's success certainly 
played a factor in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a coach, I used to love to recruit coach's sons, because you never had to 
tell them to work hard," said Lude. "There was no question that he had a 
tremendous amount of energy and a great work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 "When other kids were playing with fire trucks, he was probably sitting on 
Bobby's lap watching game film. He was the right man for the right job at the 
right time. It was not a hard decision." 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, it appears as if Bowden has come out of nowhere -- virtually 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reality is that he had spent more than a decade preparing for the 
spotlight, from his years as a graduate assistant for his father at Florida 
State through head coaching stints at Salem (West Va.) College and Samford. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had 10 years of coaching mistakes, but I didn't have to do it in front 
of a national audience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden's career as a head coach actually began with another streak: After 
leaving Tallahassee for Salem, an NAIA school of 700 students, Bowden, then 26, 
inherited a team that was coming off an 0-10 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept it going," said Bowden. "We were 0-7 my first seven games. My first 
wife left me after the sixth game. I remember the people saying, 'He's 
definitely not a chip off the old block.' I was doubting myself. You talk about 
pressure. There were more than a few people who wondered if I could be a head 
coach, including me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Bowden recalled thinking during Terry's first year as a head coach that 
"he was going to wake up and go into the real world." But he also offered words 
of encouragement, reminding Terry of the growing pains he had suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of his favorite sayings is a program is built in four stages," said Terry 
Bowden. "First you lose big, then you lose close. Then you win close, and 
finally you win big." 
</P>
<P>
 Salem wound up winning conference championships the next two years and after a 
year as quarterbacks coach at Akron under Gerry Faust, Terry Bowden wound up 
going to Samford, where his father had played and later coached. Terry Bowden 
took the job after his brother Tommy, then an Alabama assistant and now the 
Tigers' offensive coordinator, turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he did at Salem, he took his father's famous, wide-open offense with 
him. Bobby Bowden's offensive imprint has been on every team Terry has coached. 
His teams at Samford ran fumblerooskies and double-reverses just as the 
Seminoles did. His Auburn offense hasn't just swiped a page from Florida State; 
it has taken the whole playbook from those used before the elder Bowden went to 
the shotgun with Charlie Ward two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's identical to Florida State's," said Terry Bowden, who called a couple of 
direct-snap plays against Florida on Saturday. "I would call it the mid-to-late 
'80s offense with Casey Weldon and Danny McManus." 
</P>
<P>
 Said the elder Bowden: "They were doing some things against Florida that we're 
still doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The most glaring difference is that Terry Bowden's teams have been able to win 
close games -- albeit some of them against less-than-stellar competition in the 
watered-down Southeastern Conference. It's something his father gained a 
reputation for not doing until squeaking out a two-point win over Nebraska in 
last season's Orange Bowl to capture an elusive national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be the result of what Bobby Bowden sees as the biggest difference 
between them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a lot more detailed than I am," Bobby Bowden said Tuesday. "He won't let 
anything go by, whereas I might let something unimportant go by. It's like that 
saying, 'Luck is where preparation meets opportunity.' He is fully prepared 
when the opportunity comes his way." 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity might arise next season for the Bowdens to coach against each 
other -- with a national championship at stake. It is one of the reasons the 
patriarch of the country's leading college football family tried to dissuade 
his sons from getting into the business. (Another son, Jeff, is an assistant at 
Florida State.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I would do, but I wouldn't schedule," said Bobby Bowden. Then, 
with a smile, he added, "I would do my best to put him out of a job, and he'd 
do his best to retire me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Terry Bowden: "If I keep doing things like this, I would hope people 
don't forget that I'm Bobby Bowden's son. I'm very proud that he's my father. 
But I never wanted to be better than my father. You want to keep him on the 
pedestal forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would the man Florida fans derisively refer to as "Baby Bowden" mind 
staying in his father's shadow a bit longer. It's getting more difficult. With 
each passing week and another Auburn victory, that shadow seems to be growing 
shorter.

COMMENTARY; GIANTS WRONG TO COMPLAIN AFTER DUMPING PHIL SIMMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Reeves, who has lost not only some games but also some patience, said this 
week that if Dave Brown doesn't start making plays, he will have to give 
somebody else a chance to quarterback the Giants. Somebody else, in this case, 
is another kid named Kent Graham. Reeves must be kidding. Graham won't make 
enough plays, either. He will make the same mistakes Brown is making. It is 
what young quarterbacks do. If Dan Reeves was hot to win a lot of games this 
season, he shouldn't have cut Phil Simms. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't nostalgia for Simms, or football things the way they were at Giants 
Stadium. This is about the season George Young and Dan Reeves chose for the 
Giants. After going 11-5 and nearly winning the NFC East from the Cowboys, they 
chose to go with quarterbacks no better than rookies. When you do that, you are 
not a contender anymore, even if you start the season 3-0. You are a rebuilding 
team looking to get lucky. Reeves can't make it another kind of season six 
games in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave's got to start making plays," Reeves said. "If he doesn't, then Kent 
certainly has to have the opportunity to see if he can be the spark that might 
change it. I'm not going to do that this week. I mean, Dave's our starting 
quarterback, but he's got to start making the plays a quarterback has to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Brown got off to a fast start this season. He seems to be tough enough to 
play in the big leagues. He seems to have the brains for the job, and enough 
poise. Only time will tell about his arm, and his ability to win a lot of 
games. The only way to find out is by playing a lot of games. Brown has played 
six. And all of a sudden this Giants season is about where we thought it would 
be when Young and Reeves made the decision to let Simms go. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Giants would be no better than 3-3 if Simms were still around. Maybe 
the real problem on this team right now is that the Giants are incapable of 
pushing anybody around anymore and have a defensive line about as intimidating 
as a line of cheerleaders. Maybe Simms would have thrown interceptions when the 
Saints got after him, thrown a real bad interception on Monday Night Football 
against the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe he doesn't make those mistakes and the Giants are 5-1 and tied with 
the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and Reeves made a football decision with Simms, and also a business 
decision. They fired him. So here is the deal for the coach: Live with that 
decision. Reeves has been a great coach since he came to New York, I say that 
all the time. That doesn't change because the Giants have lost three in a row. 
Clearly a decision was made that this was supposed to be a transition season, 
with new faces all around, and not just at quarterback. Fair enough. A decision 
was made to move on without Simms. The Giants have moved on. But if Reeves 
wants to second-guess somebody about quarterbacks, he should start with 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 It is ridiculous for Reeves or anyone else to expect more from Brown than we 
have seen so far. He has completed 89 of 154 passes for 1,082 yards, six 
touchdowns, nine interceptions. The first six games John Elway played for 
Reeves, he had one TD pass, six interceptions. Brown will never have Elway's 
talent, or Drew Bledsoe's. And even Bledsoe, for all the yards he has gained 
passing, looked like a scared kid for most of Sunday's game against the Jets. 
Bledsoe threw three interceptions against the Raiders the week before. These 
things happen. You take the hit and keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown will survive if he gets benched. No one said this was his job for life. 
That is not the issue here. Reeves said before the season that he thought the 
Giants might be able to get to 9-7 and make the playoffs. Even that modest goal 
sounded ambitious. Then Dave Meggett handed everybody an opening-day win 
against the Eagles. Then the Giants scraped past the Cardinals and the next 
week Brown had his best day against the Redskins and all of a sudden the Giants 
were 3-0 and people in three states were giddy with the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Now come hard times, and the reality of the season. Brown throws that 
interception against the Saints. Touchdown for the Saints. The Giants are tied 
with the Vikings at halftime. Brown throws another interception, on the first 
Giants drive of the third quarter. Another touchdown for the wrong team. Giants 
lose again. Last Sunday the Rams threw a shutout at the Giants in the second 
half, and the Giants looked as bad as they have since Ray Handley. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week Reeves said Brown hasn't been making the plays and started 
warming up Kent Graham in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 If Reeves is going to bench all the Giants not making plays right now, he'd 
better ask the Steelers if they want to play six-on-six today. Reeves' team 
looks sloppy these days, and also undisciplined. The Giants take stupid 
penalties, every week, and at some point that becomes a coaching problem, too. 
They did not lose to Jerome Bettis last Sunday, they lost to a second-string 
quarterback named Chris Miller. This was a dreary game and the Giants looked 
like a dreary team. And quarterback just looked like one of Reeves' problems, 
even if he did decide to make the quarterback an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will ever know how this season would have played out if Young and 
Reeves had given Simms a chance to play. No one knows how Simms' arm would have 
stood up. No one knows if he would have made it through six more games, after 
starting all 18 games last season. Maybe Simms would have gotten punched around 
in September and October the way Joe Montana has. 
</P>
<P>
 Simms, though, is a pretty tough guy, even a month away from his 39th 
birthday. He might be right there in the pocket, the way Dan Marino is for the 
Dolphins. People thought Marino might not be able to come back from a torn 
Achilles tendon. He has stood up just fine. The Dolphins probably are pretty 
pleased they fit him under their cap. 
</P>
<P>
 If Reeves thought it was time to turn the page, that was absolutely his right. 
If Young wanted to use the salary cap as an excuse to turn the page, that was 
his right. Both of them have to live with that decision now, and live with the 
growing pains of their young quarterback. No one forced them to come into this 
season without a veteran quarterback in the house. No one forced the Giants to 
rebuild after an 11-5 playoff season. 
</P>
<P>
 Leave Dave Brown right where he is. It means leave him alone.

THE LIFE OF PYTHON; IT'S BEEN 25 YEARS SINCE THE SIX MEN OF MONTY PYTHON BANDED 
TOGETHER TO SKEWER AUTHORITY, CELEBRATE SILLINESS AND ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT 
SIDE OF DEATH. THE BEATLES OF COMEDY? WELL, DON'T EXPECT A REUNION FROM THESE 
GUYS EITHER.

<P>
 D eath be not proud seems to be one of the chief themes of the collective 
canon of Monty Python, the six-man British comedy troupe whose work first began 
airing on the BBC a quarter-century ago this month. Their TV show was infamous 
for its litany of dead parrots, sick undertakers and quasi-cannibals; their 
movies signified by medieval torture and disease, heroes dying on crosses and 
grim reapers. In Monty Python's world, there are 8 million ways to die -- all 
of them silly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of us have always been intrigued about how far you can go, to 
explore the areas that are supposed to be banned to comedy, that they're either 
in bad taste or they're too painful for people to deal with," says ex-Python 
animator Terry Gilliam, now a successful film director. "And I think that's 
what one should be dealing with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comedy is to keep the angel of death away. I always think, if you can laugh 
at it, it somehow diffuses the potency of things, whether they be diseases, 
death, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been getting away from comedy toward more serious things in my own 
films. But I do know that if I ever get to the point where I can't make a joke 
about anything , it's time to pack it in and get out. I love bad taste jokes. I 
don't know if you were at the event the other night when David Sherlock, 
Graham's longtime companion, brought Graham (Chapman) to the party?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliam is referring to the opening night of the 25th-anniversary salute to 
Monty Python held last month at the Directors Guild. This film festival 
(co-sponsored by the American Cinematheque and the British Assn. of Film and 
Television) featured the most comprehensive roundup of Python group and solo 
work ever assembled. And, as the only official MP commemoration on either side 
of the Atlantic this year, the five-day confab was able to claim four of six 
Python members on the premises -- Gilliam, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Graham 
Chapman -- with only John Cleese and Michael Palin not making the fest. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's been a little more than five years since Chapman -- to quote 
the dead parrot sketch -- "rung down the curtain and joined the choir 
invisible." Which would seem to have precluded any further personal 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, announced Sherlock, as the assembled gathered to pay tribute to the 
legendarily wild Chapman on the opening night, "I think Graham would've 
absolutely loved to have been here tonight, and I've done my very best to bring 
Graham with me. And here he is." Whereupon Chapman's ex reached into a packet, 
pulled out some ashes and proceeded to gently sprinkle several smatterings of 
his late, longtime companion's remains onto unsuspecting patrons in the front 
rows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now how many people would do that?" asks Gilliam, still giggling in his 
inimically maniacal fashion days later, appreciating that Sherlock's unexpected 
gesture managed to incorporate shock value and sentiment. "And I think it's 
wonderful. I'm sure most of the people there thought it was a joke, but it 
really was Graham. A bit of him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just as there's literally a trace of Python now, presumably, in the Directors 
Guild's vacuums and a few dozen shower drains around the city, there's much 
more than a bit of Python in the state of contemporary comedy, as the troupe's 
sweeping influence continues to be deeply felt. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the world have been ready -- one can only wonder -- for "Mrs. 
Doubtfire," the Kids in the Hall, RuPaul or "Ed Wood" without Python's 
pioneering transvestism, on a scale not seen since the days of Shakespeare? 
</P>
<P>
 More seriously, would there have been a "Saturday Night Live" as we know it 
without the debt that transformingly irreverent series' creator and original 
cast acknowledged they owed to their British forebears? 
</P>
<P>
 It's cliche by now to refer to Monty Python as "the Beatles of comedy." But 
the analogy holds up, inasmuch as the group's whole was even stronger than the 
sum of its highly individualistic solo parts, and inasmuch as their psychic 
effect on society at a turning point in history for youth culture was 
incalculable. 
</P>
<P>
 Python itself borrowed heavily from literary and pop media antecedents but, 
caught up in the anarchic spirit of the late '60s, the group synthesized these 
elements like no one before (or, really, since) -- mixing the arcane with the 
juvenile, sight gags with slippery linguistics, biting anti-authoritarian 
satire with unrepentant silliness, pointed social parody with non sequiturs. 
</P>
<P>
 And, to wax post-modern for a moment, here was deconstructionism -- a 
self-reflexive playing with the very form itself -- on a level not heretofore 
witnessed in the mass media, later to be echoed a bit more linearaly by 
descendants from Steve Martin to David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 A few dictionaries now even include a definition for the critically oft-used 
word Pythonesque . England's Chambers Dictionary defines the word as meaning 
"bizarre and surreal," while the Dictionary of Slang qualifies this to 
specifically define the adjective as suggesting "a set of events that are more 
than bizarre, but less than surreal" (emphasis ours). 
</P>
<P>
 But "the great thing about Python was that it was very, very hard to define 
exactly what the humor was," says Michael Palin, reached at his home in London, 
where he's at work on a novel. "We had Terry Gilliam's animation, which was an 
enormous advantage; we had bits on film; we had a real rag-bag of ideas that 
never went anywhere, as well as conventional sketches; and the sort of, if you 
like, destruction of a conventional television format. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can talk about evolutionary scales (just) 25 years down the 
road. But the fact that it's still being shown in countries as diverse as 
Turkey, New Zealand and Czechoslovakia -- and Latvia's just bought the shows -- 
must mean we did something right. . . . I think anybody who thinks the world is 
a bit dull tends to like Python, because they see Python as still shaking up 
something, as still doing something that was a bit irresponsible. And I suppose 
that is what endures." 
</P>
<P>
 Monty Python as a working unit, of course, has not endured, the apparent swan 
song having been the 1983 movie "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life." 
</P>
<P>
 And when a brave soul in the audience at the Directors Guild last month 
proffered the hope of a possible Python reunion during a post-screening Q&A, 
Idle -- perhaps the least nostalgic of all ex-Pythons, rivaled only by Cleese 
-- quickly pooh-poohed any such hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very, very no chance at all," Idle told the disappointed fan. "No, it's very 
hard to do when Graham persists in remaining dead. I think he's gone on too 
long now." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliam, for his part, is a bit more elaborative about why a Chapman-less 
Python wouldn't slither. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we ought to have a Python reunion with Julian Lennon playing Graham's 
part," he quips. "That would do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, what was really important was the six of us. And I think what 
intrigued me -- probably this is like any of the rock groups -- is the 
particular chemistry created by the six people together, and it wasn't the same 
in the shows we did when one was out of it. The dynamic had shifted, it wasn't 
quite right, it didn't have that quantum leap." (One test of this was the TV 
series' fourth and final season in 1974, after Cleese had quit the show, though 
he later rejoined for all the subsequent albums, concert tours and movies.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always amazed by the serendipitous nature of things, how we all just 
happened to get together at the right time, and intrigued by when you put two 
things together and out of it comes something greater, that in people's minds 
becomes more indelible," Gilliam says. "I think that was the case with Python 
-- because if people didn't get the jokes about logical positivism and the 
German philosophers, they'd get the joke of a foot coming down and squashing 
something with a fart noise."  
</P>
<P>
 N o reunion? No matter. The popularity hasn't waned to speak of, not after 
uninterrupted years of American reruns of the TV series (currently on Comedy 
Central) and frequent revivals of the films have captured several successive 
generations. This fall is actually seeing an unprecedented number of new Python 
products released -- among them, a boxed set compressing all the group's albums 
onto five CDs and, most excitingly, a brave new CD-ROM that actually does the 
lunatic Python spirit justice. (See story below.)  
</P>
<P>
 It's suggested that Monty Python may be bigger -- and more profitable, 
certainly -- in death than in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the Marilyn Monroe of comedy, are we?" giggles Gilliam. "You're 
probably right. If we were still doing the shows, we'd just be these old farts, 
hanging on. By being exotic, distant, we don't have to do the work anymore; in 
death you become emblematic or symbolic of a golden age. You can't do it if 
somebody's alive and hanging around your doorstep and continuing to embarrass 
you in public." 
</P>
<P>
 The 25th anniversary brings forth reactions from the group members as 
divergent as their legendary personality quirks. The extroverts of the group 
were Chapman, Palin, Jones and Gilliam, while Cleese and Idle were the 
"difficult," pensive introverts; their feelings about recalling Python's salad 
days pretty much fall along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels rather jolly, really. It's a momentous moment here!" says Terry 
Jones, the most effusive and (yes) jolly of the Pythons, reached at his London 
home on Oct. 5, the actual anniversary of the first TV episode's airing. "But 
I'm glad it only happens every 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached that same day, Palin is slightly more reserved, but characteristically 
upbeat -- he being the one everyone to a man calls "the nice Python." 
</P>
<P>
 "If Python was anything, it wasn't sentimental; it sort of lived for the 
moment," Palin says. "I'm extremely grateful that anyone in the world wants to 
keep watching Python material, and it's fascinating to know that it's jumped a 
generation and there are now teen-agers who are as enthusiastic as they were 25 
years ago . . . but it's not like the end of World War II or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleese and Idle declined to be interviewed for this story, but have made 
public statements reflecting their lack of interest in discussing Python-mania. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked his feelings at a Q&A he took part in as part of the festival, Idle 
allowed, "It's nice, and we like the checks. It is very flattering, but it's 
strange as well. It's a bit like somebody throwing you a wedding anniversary 
for a wife you left 12 years ago. But thanks anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 From his home in England, Cleese sent a welcoming statement to be read at a 
Python anniversary party at the British consul general's home in Los Angeles, a 
non-greeting that those who know his temperament would say is probably only 
half-facetious: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am extremely disappointed that the Monty Python 25th anniversary 
celebration is taking place. It would be more truly Pythonic to celebrate Monty 
Python's 27th anniversary. Therefore," Cleese wrote -- reviving abuse once 
shouted from a castle turret in a bad French accent -- "a plague on you all, 
and, I quote, 'I wave my private parts in your general direction'." 
</P>
<P>
 N o one -- least of all the BBC -- soothsaw Monty Python as bound for glory 
when the show inauspiciously began in a late-night slot on Oct. 5, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 All six had extensive TV comedy experience but were far from stars. Cleese -- 
then as now probably the most recognizable of the bunch, known to Brits in the 
late '60s for his sketch work on David Frost's humor shows -- was asked by the 
BBC to put together a new comedy team for a late Saturday night slot. The 
obvious first choice was Chapman, his writing partner since their Cambridge 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining four acquaintances Cleese recruited were, at the time, all 
working on a children's series (as was Python musical collaborator Neil Innes, 
then a member of the Bonzo Dog Band). Idle was another Cambridge alumnus who 
tended to work on his own; Jones and Palin were a writing team who'd met up at 
Oxford; and "token American" Gilliam was an ex-Angeleno who'd gone to 
Occidental College and migrated to England in '67. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the main thing is that it was a group of people who knew exactly what 
they were looking for," Gilliam says. "At that particular time, the BBC were 
very laissez faire about their shows, and if you got the go-ahead, they didn't 
pay any attention to you. It wasn't watered down by committees and executives 
getting together and deciding what the public wanted. It was six people saying, 
'If it makes us laugh, in it goes.' It's uneven, but there's a voice there you 
can actually hear." 
</P>
<P>
 However startlingly original, that new voice was not immaculately conceived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Python is just in a tradition of absurdist, anarchic humor that you 
could trace back to Rabelais and Lord Sterne," says Jones, who wrote a book on 
Chaucer and is probably the most literarily oriented of the group. "If you read 
'Tristram Shandy' (Sterne's 18th-Century stream-of-consciousness novel), it's 
the same sort of absurdity we were doing. He has a few pages blank in the 
middle of the novel, with a chapter heading saying 'A Chapter in Which Very 
Little Happens'." 
</P>
<P>
 Two more contemporary antecedents also bear noting: Spike Milligan's "Q5" TV 
series, which pre-dated Python in often substituting transitions for 
punchlines; and the 1950s radio series "The Goon Show," which featured Milligan 
and Peter Sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 A merican audiences may see the show as all silliness and no satire. But in 
fact a good number of the skits rely on an understanding of the British class 
system that's being subtly attacked to really register in all their 
outrageousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans don't usually understand class. They think it's about money," says 
Martin Lewis, a producer, longtime friend of the group and expatriate Brit who 
put together last month's local retrospective. "It's not about money, it's 
about breeding . The class system is the most omnipresent facet of British 
life, something that is apparent from the first breath of the day to the last 
breath at night, because it's about language and accent and gets everyone 
instantly pigeonholed. And that was a major part of the Pythons' sensibility." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Lewis points out the famous "nudge nudge, say no more " sketch 
-- funny enough in a void, but even funnier to those who recognize Idle's 
sexually suggestive boor as a lower-middle-class bloke who's ascended to the 
nouveau riche without losing his vulgarity, and Jones' character as a 
threatened member of the proper, old-fashioned middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 One element of "Circus" humor that did easily fly across the Atlantic was the 
spoofery of the form of television itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Neil Innes: "I've always had the feeling that once the novelty of 
pictures coming through the sky disappeared and you took it for granted, 
audiences became much more aware of how television is made, and therefore more 
open to jokes about it. I think the Pythons were the first ones to do that. I 
suppose Oliver Stone's trying it right now (with 'Natural Born Killers'). They 
would turn it on its head; they were cubists, in a way." 
</P>
<P>
 The unheralded show became a smash, yet Cleese's attitude began to noticeably 
sour during the second season, and he left after the third. Without him around, 
the level of dissent dropped sharply, but so did the chemistry. The others 
opted to pack it in after a truncated fourth series, despite the BBC's 
entreaties to keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Cleese's ornery unwillingness to celebrate Python, Gilliam says, "I think 
John keeps trying to put it behind him. I have this terrible feeling that it 
was a painful time for him in many ways, because he was not the sole voice, 
with everybody bowing and kowtowing around him. He was the first to get tired 
of the give-and-take of the group, the battles. And that's kind of a pity, 
because he was very good in Python, and some of the stuff came out of that 
tension. On the other hand, John has enough internal tension that he seems to 
be able to do it on his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleese had a huge "solo" success not long after "Flying Circus" with his 
"Fawlty Towers," but was lured back by the promise of feature films. Python 
didn't just coast on continuing public good will into this new medium but 
expanded the troupe's reach to tap into richer, deeper and more universally 
relevant veins of dark humor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arthurian spoof "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" was a hit in America as 
well as England in 1975, and paved the way for U.S. popularity of the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 On 1979's "Life of Brian," protests of blasphemy from conservative religious 
groups -- many of whom hadn't seen the film and didn't realize the title 
character was supposed to be a hapless contemporary to, not parodic replacement 
for, Jesus Christ -- actually helped rally viewer interest. 
</P>
<P>
 These films and the final, encompassingly episodic "Meaning of Life" moved 
into headier satirical realms of religion, sexuality, injustices both 
historical and contemporary, and the eternal problems of existence and death. 
No longer was the comedy based primarily in zany variations on class 
hyperconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," says Jones of the thematic evolution in the shift from TV to films, "I 
suppose you make jokes about men in bowler hats and upper-class twits and it 
gets less interesting after a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, we were children of the '60s, and we thought class in England was on 
its way out; by the time we stopped doing the TV show in the mid-'70s, we 
thought things were gonna change," Jones recalls. "What we didn't know was that 
we were gonna get 14 years of Thatcherite Tory rule that was gonna drag 
everything back to where it was before the '60s. I think those class targets 
which were getting a bit passe by the time we finished doing Python have now 
come back into fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 A s a phenomenon, Monty Py thon won't die, much to the bemusement and/or 
irritation of its members. They find the enthusiasm to be far greater in 
America than in England, partially because the 45 episodes of "Flying Circus" 
have been airing almost continuously here for over 20 years, whereas the BBC 
(which Gilliam believes "isn't quite comfortable with it even now") has, 
astonishingly, only rerun the show a few times. 
</P>
<P>
 It also may be a fundamental difference of national personalities. "They're 
just more into their cults on this side of the ocean," says Carol Cleveland, 
known as "the seventh Python" for her frequent non-drag female parts, visiting 
town to prepare for a one-woman show she'll present in L.A. next year. In 
Britain, Cleveland says, "We're not a cult nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the ditty "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" -- sung and whistled by 
Idle as he hangs dying on a cross at the end of "Life of Brian" -- unexpectedly 
shot to the top of the pop charts in England just two years ago, after football 
fans there began singing it whenever their teams started losing badly. As a 
result of this No. 1, Idle even got to sing the tune for the queen at a royal 
variety performance, albeit with one naughty bit of the lyric replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 As "solo" careers go, Idle's has lately been the most problematic; with a lot 
of scripts he's written yet unmade, his corrosive brilliance has been recently 
relegated to appearing in the likes of "Nuns on the Run" and the upcoming 
"Casper the Friendly Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' directing career stalled somewhat after his "Erik the Viking," but he 
has more scripts in development, and has concentrated lately on a multitude of 
books. He'll be here to sign his perversely Pythonesque new children's tome, 
"Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book," on Monday at Book Soup, and his 
four-part BBC history of the Crusades will air next year on the Learning 
Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleese has amassed a fortune from his TV commercials and management-training 
film company, which allows him to work at his own snail's pace. For years he's 
been holed up penning the quasi-sequel to the smash 1987 comedy he wrote and 
starred in, "A Fish Called Wanda"; the new "Death Fish II" (as it may or may 
not actually be titled) will probably shoot next year, with Cleese, Palin and 
the other original cast members appearing, reportedly, as similar yet different 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Palin's most recent acclaim has come with two earth-traversing documentary 
miniseries, "Around the World in 80 Days" and "Pole to Pole," with a third 
globe-trot mapped out for after he completes Cleese's movie. 
</P>
<P>
 G illiam's may be the most imaginative extension of the Python ethos into a 
new frontier, with a feel for the fantastic as well as mundane, and uneasily 
incorporating tragedy as well as comedy. Following such revered efforts as 
"Brazil" and "The Fisher King," and a lot of recent false starts, his first new 
film in four years -- a time-travel story titled "Twelve Monkeys" -- starts 
shooting next year, with Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe reportedly 
starring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of us (from Python) take things exceedingly seriously," Gilliam 
says. "But rather than mope around and get boring about it, we try to find 
humorous ways of dealing with it. I've probably pulled away more than the 
others from comedy, even though it's always part of what I'm doing; I'm 
enjoying trying to do things that are serious and moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just intrigued how far you can stretch it. I suppose that's the one thing 
in common with everything that I've played with: How funny can you make it? How 
tragic can you make it? How beautiful can you make it? How romantic? How 
grotesque and ugly and disturbing? I want to play with all that stuff and see 
what you can do."*

A DOWNTOWN DIVA DOES THE '90S; LAURIE ANDERSON GAVE '70S PERFORMANCE ART A POP 
MUSIC TWIST IN THE '80S TO HUGE ACCLAIM. AFTER FIVE YEARS OF LYING LOW, SHE'S 
MAKING RECORDS AGAIN. THE QUESTION IS -- CAN THE QUEEN OF MULTIMEDIA HIP FIND A 
PLACE IN THE NEW DECADE? 
</P>

<P>
 One of the first things you notice about Laurie Anderson, offstage, is the 
lack of . . . The Pause. She speaks plain ly, pleasantly, sometimes drifting 
off onto tangents, only to swerve back suddenly to the point at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But you half-expect . . . The Pause. Her signature pause, lining the path to 
some incisive or mock-naive observation, or a cheeky non sequitur, has become a 
personal signifier. The Pause, co-opted from both stand-up comic shtick and 
chic '80s art-world irony, is central to the oft-imitated operative Laurie 
Anderson vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pause lets you know that what you're hearing may or may not be the gospel 
truth. It lets you know that behind that dimpled and spike-coiffed image may be 
an incurable trickster taking you for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a danger of self-parody that Anderson, now in her late 40s, faces as 
she rejoins the cultural scene with the Tuesday release on the Warner Bros. 
label of "Bright Red," her first album in more than four years ( see review, 
Page 92 ) . Not only has she had many imitators, but she's repeated her act so 
often herself that her trademark idiosyncrasies threaten to become cliche. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson burst into the '80s as a new kind of accessible conceptualist, with 
the surprise hit "O Superman." Then came various projects that established her 
as the rare bird who leaped from the art world to the pop world. 
</P>
<P>
 Her large-scale early-'80s multimedia piece "United States: Part I-IV" 
combined song, projections and surreal theatrics. The music portion of the show 
became a landmark five-record set for Warner Bros. (1984). She also recorded 
"Big Science" (1982), "Mister Heartbreak" (1984), "Home of the Brave" 
(soundtrack to the 1986 film) and "Strange Angels" (1989) for the label. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson carved an impressive swath through the '80s. But the question now: Is 
Anderson ready for the '90s -- or vice versa? 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's place in SoHo is a spacious spread in a building overlooking the 
Hudson River. In timeless house-upstairs, shop-downstairs tradition, she lives 
on the sixth floor and works in her fully equipped home studio on the floor 
below. Her hardwood-floored flat is Spartan in decor, making such artifacts as 
a photo of the Dalai Lama, a koto on the wall and a pinata all the more 
conspicuous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing jeans and a gray vest over a button-down white shirt, Anderson 
displays only one hint of flamboyance this day: her Neapolitan-hued sneakers. 
She smokes filter-less cigarettes and serves visitors cappuccino while 
unveiling the just-finished new album in the comforts of her home studio. A 
restless sort, she interrupts the interview to answer the phone and to deal 
with a number of guests dropping by. 
</P>
<P>
 A view of the river peeks out from behind her mixing console. Boats slice 
silently through the water below, almost dreamily. Listening to the freshly 
mixed new album, coated with the gauzy, ambient overlay that producer Brian Eno 
is known for, one can easily imagine the creative environment feeding the art. 
</P>
<P>
 In conversation, Anderson comes off candid, earnest, especially when 
discussing the nuts-and-bolts aspects of her work. But she also seems to have a 
keen ability to swerve off the subject, perhaps to maintain control of an 
interview. When the question of her hiatus from recording comes up, she 
skillfully brushes it aside, rambling about the lack of venues for video 
artists, or the promise of better living through the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she spent a year putting together a book, "Stories From the Nerve 
Bible," which came out this spring, and has been doing various film projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Anderson's roots are in the shock-tactical performance art scene of the 
'70s, her presentation has always been less about confrontation or archetype 
smashing than about an almost childlike wonder. She's all about connections of 
dots, parts and ideas not normally linked. She plays violin but has filled the 
instrument with water or replaced strings with a tape head that played spoken 
bits of language. 
</P>
<P>
 She is never about one thing at any given time. She lives in the hyphens that 
inevitably pop up in descriptions of the real Laurie Anderson, as performance 
artist-pop singer-storyteller-poet-author-violinist-postmodern 
deconstructionist-multimedia conjurer. Androgynous, topical and yet universal, 
Anderson covers a lot of bases at once without ever getting stuck in one place. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this slippery tendency boil down to an aesthetic statement, a defense 
mechanism or both? Anderson seems to revel in her role as a hard-to-categorize 
cult heroine in pop music. 
</P>
<P>
 "If pop is the mainstream, I'm an offshoot," she comments. "Maybe I'm a 
slightly parallel, smaller stream. In a way, I still feel like I'm someone from 
the art world who happens to be occasionally making records. I'm not exactly 
cranking them out," she says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate Warner Bros. for that: They don't ever call and say, 'Are you 
making any music these days?' It's great. Well, also, I'm like a vanity artist 
for them, an in-house intellectual to be tolerated. I'm also a kind of 
catalogue artist. People might actually be interested in something from 10 
years ago, since my records never creep up any chart. But they have a little 
life of their own, and I'm happy with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about selling a lot of records, because I never thought that the 
more people bought my records, the better it was. I would probably tend to 
think the opposite. I'm that much of a snob. Don't get me wrong. I love pop 
culture. I find it entertaining but only on the level of something to criticize 
-- in a way to be a gadfly and say, 'Do you really think this is important?' 
But you can't just do that, because then you're just a crank over on the side." 
</P>
<P>
 But in this area, as in many others, Anderson displays her duality; while 
professing that she doesn't care if she sells, she wants people to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I could entertain myself very well here at home. I also like doing 
concerts. That would be fine," she says. "But to make stuff, manufacture things 
that nobody buys? What's the point in that?" 
</P>
<P>
 L ike her earlier albums, "Bright Red" is endearingly quirky and full of 
artful dodging, yet it seems more personal and darkly reflective. Where once 
Anderson sang of angels and made bemused commentaries about common experiences, 
on "Bright Red" there are demons afoot. She addresses darker subjects: AIDS 
("Love Among the Sailors"), apocalypse ("Muddy River"), infidels ("Poison"), 
mortality ("World Without End") and the bleary rush of time ("Same Time 
Tomorrow"). 
</P>
<P>
 As with everything else she does, Anderson's "Stories From the Nerve Bible" 
strays from the straight line of orthodoxy, as a non-chronological collection 
and examination of her work thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unorthodox promotional tour for the book, Anderson performed to a packed 
house at UCLA in April. Not only did she read from the book, but she also 
previewed material from "Bright Red," armed with electronic violin and a 
keyboard. During the reading, she relied on electronic effects to enhance the 
storytelling aspect, at times using a booming male voice, as she often does in 
performance, sounding like an android version of Charles Kuralt. 
</P>
<P>
 When it finally came time to record "Bright Red," the material came out in a 
relative torrent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote very fast -- 25 songs in six weeks," Anderson said. "I've never 
written that fast, lyrics-wise. I've written a lot of music pieces. I think it 
was because I had just finished this book, 'Stories From the Nerve Bible,' and 
I was really used to being on my computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, when you do a book, you finally realize what's been important to you -- 
what are the things that you really want to say. I realize that they were 
always the same. There were stories and songs that were very short and really 
direct, very simple language, nothing fancy -- a tilted, skewed version of what 
you're looking at but still not oblique. It's just 'Here's what happened. 
Listen to this.' 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very much about talking to someone. Conversation was a big theme on 
this album, and that's where the duets came in." 
</P>
<P>
 There are several duets on the album, including two with Phil Ballou and the 
chant-like "In Our Sleep" with Lou Reed, to whom Anderson has been romantically 
linked of late. But the most unusual duet features Anderson with Arto Lindsay 
on the unsettling title track, on which the two vocalists swap lyrics, word for 
word, melting into a mutant, dual-faceted persona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do a duet that wasn't just him-and-her. That song reminds me of 
'Last Year at Marienbad' or something," she says, referring to the 1961 Alain 
Resnais film. "It's a weird situation of a couple who are sort of promising 
things to each other, and then there are odd, threatening things that happened. 
Then, in the middle, there's the bit from the Bible, from Isaiah, about 'the 
hairy ones will dance there.' You're thinking, 'What is this?' 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason I placed it second on the album is that it's a difficult piece. 
Originally, I thought maybe I should put it later when people are more used to 
the album. But then I thought, no, it has to be toward the beginning, because 
that's so much what the record is about. If people have trouble with that, then 
they probably shouldn't listen to the rest of it anyway. It's the 
separate-the-men-from-the-boys track. If you don't like this, don't waste your 
time with the rest of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The less-than-festive thematic thread of "Bright Red" came as something of a 
surprise to Anderson: 
</P>
<P>
 "When I actually looked at what they were about, they were all about the same 
thing -- not just love but destruction, equally, either through memory or some 
cataclysmic thing. There's a song called 'Night in Baghdad.' There was a CNN 
report in which they were saying that all this bombing stuff was so beautiful, 
like fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then it becomes a question of what's beautiful. There is something gorgeous 
about destruction, and liberating too. Unless you're the one who's being 
destroyed. The end of that song ends up with the question 'Did you ever love 
me?' And the answer is 'Only when you danced, so beautiful, it was like the 
Fourth of July.' You think about war and love. Many of the songs were about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 O pening the album on an am bivalent note is "Speechless," "about a symbiotic 
relationship that really went wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 "One person can't talk, and the other one ends up doing all the talking," 
Anderson explains. "So the other person is in the passenger seat, unable to say 
a word. It's a beautiful story by Annie Dillard. She saw an eagle fly down, 
with the skull of a weasel attached to its mouth. So she speculated that the 
eagle had gone down to attack the weasel, and the weasel had sunk its teeth 
into the eagle and held on until it rotted. It became this horrid albatross 
swinging away." 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians on "Bright Red" include jazz-and-then-some drummer Joey Baron, 
Brazilian percussionist Cyro Baptista, guitarist Adrian Belew and renowned New 
Music accordionist Guy Klucevsek.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was going to be the original instrumentation of the album," Anderson 
says. "I thought, 'I'll just do it with these elements -- Brazilian percussion, 
drums, bass, accordion, violin and keyboards.' It had this warped Nina Rota 
kind of feel. It was a very cool band sound." 
</P>
<P>
 But what came out in the end, after much reconfiguring and evolution, was a 
sparser, more enigmatic and diverse sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a couple of songs with the band and started hearing some birds in 
there, some other kinds of thought or instruments," she says. "I was missing 
other certain textures, so I piled a bunch of those on. And then eventually, at 
the end, I stripped things way back. There was a song, 'Muddy River,' with nine 
bass players on it. In the end, it was stripped down to almost nothing." She 
laughs. "I guess this is my minimal period." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson has lived in SoHo long enough to pine for the old, pre-gentrification 
days of the mid-'70s, when her interdisciplinary aesthetic started taking 
shape. Twenty years later, Anderson is one of the world's best-known and 
skilled multimedia mediators, one of whose juggling acts has been to thrive in 
an urban setting while avoiding the edgier aspects of urban life and art. 
</P>
<P>
 Living here, she says, "had a big impact on a lot of my preferences, a lot of 
my friends, a lot of what I think is interesting, which is in the avant-garde. 
There still is a bit of avant-garde left. People are doing interesting things. 
There are occasionally great shows in galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, I'm the kind of person who has to feel like I'm part of a neighborhood. 
I like that. SoHo has changed enormously since then. It's a lot of shoe stores 
now, really. I'm not really fooling myself by thinking that the avant-garde is 
centered here, but there still is stuff going on. All of my longest friendships 
and collaborations are rooted here." 
</P>
<P>
 A lthough her world of influence has expanded exponentially since she was an 
aspiring young artist 20 years ago, Anderson keeps in contact with people from 
the "neighborhood." Two days after this interview, Anderson performed her own 
music behind a poem by John Ashbery, a longtime friend, in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew John from my days when I was an art critic, back in the days when 
poets were critics" -- she breaks into a one-phrase song, " 'when poets were 
critics. . . .' 
</P>
<P>
 "That was really how they got their writing done -- they'd go to see paintings 
and write vaguely about the paintings but mostly work on their style. It was 
illustrative writing." 
</P>
<P>
 The ever-versatile Anderson has worked in film as well. Well-traveled between 
musical and visual dimensions and blessed with a strong instinct for the 
evocative atmospheres, she was a logical candidate to provide music for 
music-sensitive director Wim Wenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "His film 'Wings of Desire' was about to premiere in Cannes (in 1988), and he 
was mixing in a studio in town so he could run over to the festival," she 
recalls. "I can relate to that so heavily. He calls me up and says, 'Can you 
get me some angel fragments?' Oddly enough, I knew exactly what he meant. I 
asked, 'How many minutes?' 'Twenty.' 'Great.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So I put something together on a cassette, thinking that if he was 
interested, I'd record it properly. Well, he used the cassette. The thing was 
it sounded just fine. He's really clever that way. He can take something that's 
a little bit rough and use it really well. He really loves music. He made 
original music videos 20 years ago when all his films were based on a piece of 
music. He would take a song and shoot the thing. He knows music really well." 
</P>
<P>
 As influences from cinema go, Rainer Werner Fassbinder also ranks highly in 
her book. Like Fassbinder, Anderson's own work operates on more than one level. 
Raise the subject of the late German director, and Anderson becomes effusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a guy who's in this very heavy art scene in Munich, very tough, black 
leather, drugs. He could have been making hard-edged movies that were more like 
'Querelle,' " she says of his 1982 film, "but most of his films were about 
these giant middle-aged, middle-class German people who were very inarticulate. 
They were like pieces of upholstered furniture moving around. He had such 
empathy for these people. It was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, Anderson compares Fassbinder's character studies to early Bob 
Dylan songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, instead of pop songs saying, 'Hey ho, look at me, look at 
my car,' he was writing about losers who didn't have it together. It was like a 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it was so personal. In a way, unless it's Billie Holiday singing, the 
blues almost has this generic quality -- like we've all got the blues. Dylan 
has so many quirky personal details about why he feels bad. It's not just that 
he has the blues. He tells you exactly why, and what he's wearing and what he's 
seeing. Those two guys -- Dylan and Fassbinder -- have a lot in common." 
</P>
<P>
 Much as she has preserved a sense of aloofness through her work, shards from 
Anderson's personal life continually crop up. One of the sound sources on the 
song "Tightrope" in "Bright Red" comes from Anderson's private sonic archives, 
a recording of a Pentecostal preacher exhorting about the Second Coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recorded her in a church in the South about 10 years ago," Anderson says, 
"and always wanted to do something with her. This was, unfortunately, where she 
landed, but I've got hours of it. She was the most charismatic, fabulous 
speaker. It was the kind of service where everyone was just jumping up and down 
and having a wild time, with a trap set on the altar. It was really a great 
service, just rollicking. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother was a Southern Baptist, and I used to go with her (to church) 
to see the brothers and sisters sing. It was that kind of sweaty, wild service 
where people would lose it from time to time and roll in the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time I'd seen anything like it was in Jerusalem in a Reform 
synagogue. People did the same thing standing up, shoulder to shoulder, making 
vocal noises and seeing things. I thought, 'This is what it should be like,' 
not just sitting calmly in those rows and listening to someone saying, 'You 
were wrong, you were wrong, you should really try harder.' You leave exhausted, 
thinking, 'Oh, I've failed again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In her work, Anderson has long drawn on religious references, through direct 
biblical quotations or by incorporating performance techniques borrowed from 
gospel traditions. Why the religious veneer? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why," Anderson says, shrugging. "Maybe it's the millennial 
thing. A lot of my childhood was about scare stories -- these very weird Bible 
stories, with talking snakes and parting oceans. Regular people who were adults 
were telling me these things, mowing their lawns, going to potluck parties, and 
then they'd tell me these fantastic things as truth. That was my first taste of 
surrealism. Normal people telling me that clowns are going to rise up out of 
their cars and go somewhere. It opened up another world for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Did this early exposure to religion provide seeds for her future art and her 
wild imagination? 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, because it also involved believing something," she says. "I 
always thought that the reason I was attracted to art was that it almost gave 
meaning to people's lives, especially in the early days of SoHo. People were 
very intense about what this meant. We were in another world, and it was an 
alternative to this one. It was more complex, and better, just basically a 
better world. It was a world full of wild aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made contact with other people. It wasn't isolated. I really do think that 
the biggest problem" -- she suddenly speaks brashly, like a huckster 
street-corner preacher -- "the biggest problem here in this country" -- then 
she returns to a more serious tone -- "is loneliness. You're sold so much stuff 
all the time about what's supposed to mean something. Pop culture is a good 
example of that, or the news. You have this fake connection to the world, as if 
you know what's going on. But, really, the things they're talking about are 
gossip -- which I love. But it's not what gives meaning to my life. It's just 
for fun. Any of the major questions that I have -- like 'Why am I here?' -- 
nobody even attempts to grapple with. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons that I put a talking piece at the end of this record was 
because there are so many questions in the lyrics," Anderson says, referring to 
"Same Time Tomorrow." I noticed that on the lyric sheets and did a 
question-mark search with my computer. There are tons of them, all over the 
place. There are very few answers. It's mostly because I've always hated people 
who come up with answers." 
</P>
<P>
 She pauses, taking a drag on her cigarette, and continues: 
</P>
<P>
 "Asking a good question is real important. People will all come up with their 
own answers in their own lives to given questions. There are lots of different 
kinds of questions to ask, to help point to some of those things."*

ACTS OF LOVE AND OTHER STORIES; THE ECCENTRIC PORTRAITS IN VICTORIA WILLIAMS'

SHE'S KNOWN THE LAST FEW YEARS. IT'S LIKE NOTHING ELSE IN POP MUSIC.

 ' Over here!" calls out Victoria Williams' in her unmistakably high-pitched 
twang, from somewhere mysterious in the vicinity of her smallish Laurel Canyon 
home. Her voice is coming from next door, but with all possible entrances to 
her neighbor's house locked, and an eight-foot wooden fence in between, 
Williams' fetching Lousiana accent seems destined to remain disembodied for the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally she yells over instructions on how to find the hole in the fence, 
which turns out to be easy enough to stoop through, give or take a couple of 
vines. Next door, Williams is swimming laps in a pool, as her neighbor has 
allowed her to do every day for the last three weeks or so. The semi-secret 
passage was already there before this arrangement was struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so fortunate to have this. I think these people who built these two 
houses were friends, because they made this gap in the fence," Williams says as 
she skims sideways across the pool, seeming as pleased as a kid who's happened 
across somebody else's fort in the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These nearly inconsequential little acts of friendship -- present and 
presumably past -- are the sort that mean a lot to Williams, 36, a 
singer-songwriter who seems to feed on decent gestures and enduring spirits as 
sweet grist for her strikingly warm and hopeful music. Rendered in Williams' 
unique voice, the milk of human kindness is not at all milquetoast, but the 
wonderful stuff of eccentric forbearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Truest love is both a quirky and eternal thing in "Loose," Williams' engaging 
third album, which combines some of the weird little narratives we're trained 
to expect from a conventionally twisted Southern writer with a gospel singer's 
faith in human as well as divine nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Here there are odes to friendship itself ("My Ally," a duet with Soul Asylum's 
Dave Pirner), offbeat eulogies for late friends ("Happy to Have Known Pappy," 
"Harry Went to Heaven"), songs about old folks who find renewal and purpose 
late in life ("Century Plant"), and straight-ahead rock 'n' roll spirituals 
("You R Loved"). It's like nothing else in pop, of course. ( See review, Page 
74.)  
</P>
<P>
 Williams once toured with Jonathan Richman, and it's easy to see why they'd 
make a natural pairing. The difference is that Williams is not such the 
deliberate naif , but brings a guilelessness to subject matter that tends 
toward the more mature. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Fox, the new album's producer, said in a separate interview that Williams 
"does have that combination of the childlike innocence and the wise sage rolled 
up into one. She's incredibly sweet, and might appear to be naive, but she's 
certainly not. She appreciates every little detail of everything that's going 
on around her at all times, and she's not just what you see on the surface. She 
couldn't write songs like that if she didn't see things in such deep, 
meaningful ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "But whenever she would approach anything she would approach it with complete, 
childlike enthusiasm," said Fox. "Especially given her new physical situation, 
it was just incredibly inspiring to see someone with such a positive attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Out here today, Williams is not exercising merely for the fun of it but 
swimming, she believes, for her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been a person who loves to swim," she says -- as a child, she 
plied the Cane River, near her hometown of Shreveport -- "but then, when that 
thing came around, everybody said swimming's the best exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 The "thing" was multiple sclerosis, which was diagnosed in early 1992 after 
she had some trouble with her hands while on tour opening for Neil Young. 
Having developed an understandable interest in holistic health, she's read up 
on the benefits of water exercise for relieving the stress that makes symptoms 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a study done with this doctor who was ahead of his time back in the 
'40s, with all these people that had that MS," she says, standing upright in 
the pool, "and he had people on this high-vitamin swimming diet. And the people 
that were in his group were all still alive in like '75, and the ones that 
weren't doing the swimming every day all were dead by the time of the '60s. And 
they never include that in the AMA stuff; they just want people to be sick." 
And it's back to the breast stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 This last comment is about as bitter as Williams seems to get. Asked if, as a 
longtime devout Christian, she found the onset of her malady faith-testing, she 
insists that it was instead "strengthening, faith- strengthening . Trials are a 
blessing that are given to a person to endure and become strong, even if they 
seem like something bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts me more in a position of leaning on God. Which is a good position to 
be in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It may seem either much too faithful or much too perverse to trace the 
connection between Williams' trial and the way her career has recently been 
blessed. Yet, through a series of events that goes back to the discovery of her 
MS, she finds herself more renowned and more revered than ever -- on the 
precipice of breaking through from cult artist to, well, major cult artist at 
least. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many musicians, Williams had no health insurance at the time of the 
diagnosis. Fellow musician T Bone Burnett organized a benefit for her at the 
Whisky in June of '92 that featured Counting Crows, Sam Phillips, Maria McKee, 
Michael Penn and several other acts, and she was able to pay off a stack of 
bills later that night. Out of that good will Williams resolved to establish 
what became the Sweet Relief Foundation, which would collect donations on 
behalf of other musicians who found themselves ill and ill-financed. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary contributor to the foundation so far has been the 1993 album 
"Sweet Relief -- A Tribute to Victoria Williams," in which a couple of artists 
who were at the Whisky benefit and a lot more who weren't perform her songs. 
One track, Pearl Jam's brooding "Crazy Mary," became a staple of rock radio as 
that band's star was just ascending. And cuts by well-known artists including 
Lou Reed, Soul Asylum, Evan Dando, Matthew Sweet and many others upped the 
cache value for alternative music fans who'd never even heard of Williams 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like a genuinely loving record," Williams says, using her hands to 
scoop away the bougainvillea leaves that seem to migrate toward her in the 
pool. "I remember the first time I heard it, I was in Louisiana and I was 
driving down this gravel road, and I stopped just to listen to it. I had it 
turned up with the windows down, and the bugs were singing really loud, and it 
seemed like they were singing with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The notoriety brought about by "Sweet Relief" puts Williams in an interesting 
position, now that she's finally releasing a post-tribute album of her own. 
Millions have heard her name, if only as FM disc jockeys back-announced the 
album whence that bitchin' Pearl Jam track came. But what will the hordes who 
know only of her think of her own version of "Crazy Mary," being released as 
the first track to radio from "Loose"? 
</P>
<P>
 What will they make of a singer whose unusual style and jazzy-folk phrasing 
have gotten her compared to everyone from Rickie Lee Jones to Olive Oyl 
(favorably, of course)? Of the woman whose writing so evokes the rural that she 
might seem almost equal parts Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, Van Dyke Parks 
and Uncle Remus? Are they ready for the country, as it were? 
</P>
<P>
 "Could you hand me that towel?" she asks, shaking her hair and shaking off the 
self-consciousness that answering such a question would entail. "Well," she 
says simply, her voice rising to a high pitch of cheerful ingenuousness, "I 
hope they have a good time!"  
</P>
<P>
 'I 'm sorry you didn't get to meet Molly," says Williams, leading the way back 
through the fence portal and into her house. Molly is the dog seen on the cover 
of "Loose," but she's not home right now -- nor is her husband of 10 months, 
Mark Olson of the critically admired roots-rock band the Jayhawks. (Living in 
her basement now is ex-Lone Justice drummer Don Heffington, who wrote this 
album's "Psalms"; "We're all snug as a bug in a rug," she reports of the 
setup.) 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time Williams has put a favored pooch on an album cover. 
The first was with the 1987 Geffen release "Happy Come Home," which had the 
late, beloved Belle on the front sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the title song of that debut was a fictionalized plea for another pet 
dog to, yes, come home, the album title had a broader resonance for what 
Williams was going through at the time. Then, Williams was living just up the 
street from where she resides now, with her first husband, singer Peter Case, 
to whom she was wed for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Right around the time she went off to New York to record "Happy Come Home," 
she and Case were starting to talk about divorce. The tension, she laments, 
threw her voice out of whack during the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was an emotional wreck," she recalls, toweling off, "so I was really 
emotional and tight. And when I get nervous, my voice gets all shaky-sounding. 
I felt like I shouldn't be doing a record. I liked the songs and wanted to do 
'em right, so I had thought, 'Let's just do it later,' but they wouldn't let me 
stop it, so I had to finish it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her second album, 1990's "Swing the Statue," was recorded under far less 
duress. But because it was done for a small label, the now-defunct Rough Trade, 
the trip to the studio was quick and cheap.  
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, on both those albums," Williams says, "it was like not live stuff, it 
was always overdub -- first you do the music and then you sing later. I like to 
get in there at the bare-bones bottom of it; rather than having the voice fit 
in with what else is going on."  
</P>
<P>
 This time, Williams got her wish to record "live." 
</P>
<P>
 Her domestic situation made recording more relaxed this time as well. "It's 
very nice being married to someone who loves you," Williams says of Olson, who 
talked her into marrying him just last Christmas after a decade of friendship, 
interstate correspondence and very intermittent dating. 
</P>
<P>
 Their wedding scene was "like a Capra movie!": Olson had the license drawn up 
in secret, took her to the Opelousas, La., courthouse and sprung a ring. 
Surprised, she initially balked, but the court clerks gathered round and begged 
her to reconsider. Then the judge, who'd been sent home, showed up again in 
response to a mysterious phone call no one would own up to. "And I thought, 
shiver me timbers, it is a sign, Lord!" 
</P>
<P>
 The serendipitous couple divide their time between Laurel Canyon and a second 
home in the desert near Yucca Valley, where Williams beats the heat and latent 
MS symptoms with regular swims at the local mineral hot springs pool. Several 
of the characters who figure into this album's songs are California high-desert 
locals who gather at the saloon. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the desert attracts an odd sort of citizen, she demurs: "Basically, 
there's just less people, so individuals stick out more. It does attract people 
who are fed up with the city completely, and like the desert because it's a 
thing of wonder, and there's a sense of quiet that's very loud , seeping 
through your soul. That's why I go out there."*

FILM CLIPS / LAST WRITES: THEY EVEN INCLUDE AN AUTOGRAPH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where there's a will . . . there's a Ted James way. 
</P>
<P>
 Last will, that is. As in ". . . and testament."  
</P>
<P>
 James is the head researcher and spokesman for Celebrity Collectibles, a 
Phoenix outfit that specializes in reproducing celebrity wills and related 
documents.  
</P>
<P>
 If you're still looking for that perfect $10-$20 Halloween gift for your 
favorite Hollywood gravedigger, the company offers a catalogue of more than 200 
packages. The selections range from such old Hollywood legends as Darryl F. 
Zanuck and W.C. Fields to such cultural icons as Rock Hudson (including a copy 
of his death certificate which identifies AIDS as a cause of death) to rock 
gods Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of particular note: 
</P>
<P>
 * A Marilyn Monroe package features not just a copy of her will, but claims on 
her estate, including ones from her psychiatrist, her hairdresser and even 
Western Union for telegrams allegedly sent to the Kennedys. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sharon Tate left no will, but a set of papers dealing with her includes a 
successful claim from the owner of the Benedict Canyon home for damages done 
that awful 1969 night when the Manson clan members committed the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 * The newest addition to the catalogue is Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' lengthy, 
complex will, signed shortly before her death last spring, in which she 
bequeathed a Greek alabaster bust to her longtime companion Maurice Tempelsman 
-- and nothing to her sister, Lee Radziwill (though she indicated that she made 
provisions for Radziwill while still alive). 
</P>
<P>
 It's great stuff for celebrity junkies and business is booming, according to 
James. In fact, he says, the calls from star-devotees got so out of control 
that the company had its phone number unlisted and now takes orders only by 
mail (2302 N. 44th St., Suite 4-175, Phoenix, AZ 85008). 
</P>
<P>
 But, frankly, isn't this whole business a little sick? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just supplying the curious something they want to see, people who are 
true fans," James says. 
</P>
<P>
 James got the idea of dealing in celebrity wills five years ago after reading 
of a woman selling copies of Elvis Presley's will.  
</P>
<P>
 "She merely folded up the copy in an envelope and sent it out," James says of 
the Elvis will. "I thought, 'If this is available, what else might be?' and 
took it from there." 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, it's perfectly legal. "It's public domain," James says. "These 
documents are public record. We do a substantial amount of legal research to 
stay out of trouble, and we have disclaimers that this is not sanctioned by 
anyone's estates or the government." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, anyone could go make his or her own copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you know where to look and have enough time and money, sure," James says. 
"In New York, for example, if you wanted to get something by mail, you have to 
pay a research fee, and then it's five bucks a page for a copy. The Jackie O. 
document might run you $200." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as interesting as the estate documents they have are some of the ones 
they don't -- or can't -- get ahold of. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for Buddy Holly's, but can't find it," James says. "We thought 
we'd find it in Texas where he was born, but now we're looking in New York 
where he resided at the time of his death." 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases they know where the wills are, or at least where they should 
be, but they've still eluded the company's research staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "One I've been after for years is Rudolph Valentino's," he says. "I know it's 
there in L.A., I badger the people in the documents department to death, but 
they just can't find it. And we went looking for Babe Ruth's last year, but the 
whole thing has disappeared."  
</P>
<P>
 James also says, "We get an amazing amount of requests for Hedy Lamarr's will, 
and we have a little note we send back that says, 'I'm sorry. Hedy Lamarr is 
not dead.' "

FILM CLIPS / 'SHELTER' FALLOUT: LOUNGING AROUND WITH THE STONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Levine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems unlikely that a documentary filmmaker who generally prefers classical 
music to rock would desire to make even one film about the Rolling Stones. But 
Albert Maysles recently finished his second. 
</P>
<P>
 His first, the classic "Gimme Shelter," documents the Stones' creative peak 
and their free concert in 1969 at the Altamont Speedway outside San Francisco, 
where the murder of fan Meredith Hunter brought the concert to a tragic close. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, almost 25 years later, Maysles Films made "Conversations With the 
Rolling Stones," a 30-minute VH-1 special that premieres Thursday. "VH-1 
contacted us because they knew that since we made the earlier film and (the 
Stones) respected our work, that sort of friendship would be a special entree," 
says Maysles, 67, sitting in a conference room in the Manhattan offices of the 
company, which makes commercials as well as documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did members of the Stones open up to Maysles and to off-camera MTV 
news interviewer Kurt Loder about things like the absence of bassist Bill Wyman 
and their longevity as a band, they let him film part of a tour rehearsal that 
they had originally said was off limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was filming Keith Richards, I whispered to him, 'Can we film you guys 
in rehearsal?' " Maysles says. "All he said was, 'I'll talk to Mick about it.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 It's partly Maysles' ability to establish that kind of rapport with his 
subjects that has made his nonfiction films so effective. Either because he's 
trustworthy or because his style of filming is unobtrusive, his subjects don't 
seem to mind revealing themselves to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally a psychology instructor at Boston University, Maysles went into the 
film industry after he made a short film in 1955 about patients in Russian 
mental hospitals. Along with his late brother, David, he became one of the 
pioneers of "direct cinema," an American version of cinema verite that 
emphasized recording real events on film. 
</P>
<P>
 Using hand-held cameras and sound equipment, the brothers made short 
documentaries about such subjects as Truman Capote and the Beatles, and 
"Salesman," a 1968 documentary about four door-to-door Bible salesmen they made 
with Charlotte Zwerin, deemed a classic by the Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969 a friend phoned Maysles and hinted that the Rolling Stones might be 
interested in having a documentary made. After seeing the band perform in 
Baltimore, the Maysles brothers quickly agreed to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got to Madison Square Garden (to start filming 'Gimme Shelter') . . . 
Mick turned toward us and said, 'Look, I'm not going to be an actor,' Maysles 
says. "I said, 'Of course not, we never require that of anybody.' . . . I 
picked up the camera and began filming. He must have sensed (what was 
happening) was interesting. We had no trouble after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because Altamont came to signify the end of the hippie era, "Gimme 
Shelter," which the Maysles brothers also made with Zwerin, has a historical 
importance few rock films can match. "Because we didn't interfere with what was 
going on, we had a special kind of sensitivity to it," Maysles says.  
</P>
<P>
 "Conversations," which was made by Maysles and filmmakers Kathy Dougherty and 
Susan Froemke, chronicles an event that wouldn't have taken place without a 
camera being there. But though the Stones are in an interview setting, they 
relax, and offer some interesting insights into their creative process. Jagger 
talks about writing lyrics at the last minute, and Richards tells how he came 
up with the riff for "Satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw it as a perfect match," said John Sykes, president of VH-1. "The 
combination of Loder and Maysles made (the Stones) say some incredible things." 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, it's not only what they say but how they say it. The interview 
shots are black-and-white close-ups (the rehearsals are in color), and the 
Stones' facial expressions and gestures provide exactly the kind of telling 
detail Maysles hopes gives some insight into his subjects.  
</P>
<P>
 "Making documentary films . . . the camera's picking up more than you can 
imagine," he says. "More than you can invent."*

FILM CLIPS / LEAST SUPPORTED CATEGORY: IT'S EASY: NOMINATE EVERY ACTRESS WITH A 
MAJOR ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Natale

<P>
 If Jessica Lange garners a best actress nomination for "Blue Sky" -- as many 
in Hollywood are speculating -- it will give new meaning to the word 
"underdog," says her publicist, Pat Kingsley, with a laugh. It will also be 
somewhat of a comeback for the actress who has been off screen since "Night and 
the City" two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the film for which she's getting all the hoopla was shot in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviews the Oscar-winning Lange has received for "Blue Sky" are among the 
best of her career and took everyone by surprise because of the film's somewhat 
tortured history. 
</P>
<P>
 "My little movie finally got released," says Lange. After attempting in vain 
to get it released, "I'd almost stopped thinking about it," she admits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Sky" was originally scheduled to debut in 1991 but has been sitting on a 
shelf while its studio, Orion Pictures, went into and emerged from bankruptcy. 
Orion had tried to sell "Blue Sky" and other projects in order to help pay 
their debts. When there were no takers for the old-fashioned drama, the usual 
negative assumptions were made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Sky" was then slotted for release in early 1994, but was again held back 
so that it could serve to launch a planned fall tribute to its director, the 
late Tony Richardson, who died shortly after editing on the film was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, although "Blue Sky" has grossed just slightly more than $2 million in 
limited release, Orion is planning a full-fledged Academy Award promotion for 
Lange, according to studio spokeswoman Gail Block. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never know what to think about that," Lange says of the possibility of an 
Oscar nomination. "It would be like a gift, like something out of the blue." 
</P>
<P>
 If Lange is nominated for "Blue Sky" it will be her sixth nomination, her 
fifth as best actress. She was also nominated for "Frances," "Country," "Sweet 
Dreams" and "The Music Box." She won for her supporting role in "Tootsie." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange's nomination for a film made four years ago will also serve to highlight 
the paucity -- again -- of female roles. The piecing together of a list of even 
remotely eligible best actress candidates has become such an unpleasant ritual 
that even women in the industry have tired of it. "We all know the arguments 
too well," sighs Kingsley, who in addition to Lange represents such actresses 
and past Oscar winners as Sally Field and Jodie Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a lousy year for women's roles," bemoans Liz Manne, marketing 
head of Fine Line Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Lange says she has been absent from the screen since 1992 mainly 
because none of the scripts she received were tempting. Her next hiatus won't 
be as prolonged. Lange recently completed work on back-to-back films, the drama 
"Losing Isaiah," scheduled for early 1995, and the period adventure "Rob Roy," 
in which she co-stars with Liam Neeson, also debuting next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their lip service, the major studios don't seem to have any interest 
in creating good roles for women, observes Fine Line head Ira Deutchman. "So 
you find actresses having to turn to action movies to make any impact at the 
box office," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He's referring to Meryl Streep's bravura turn in "The River Wild." Streep, a 
perennial Oscar nominee, could pull out another one this year for sheer 
chutzpah -- and because the major studios have little else to offer in terms of 
viable candidates. Other possibilities include Meg Ryan for "When a Man Loves a 
Woman" -- which debuted earlier in the year, but could be forgotten come Oscar 
time -- and two upcoming roles of note: Jodie Foster as the young savage "Nell" 
and Geena Davis, who plays a quasi-Mary Matalin type in "Speechless." Both 
films open in December. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Deutchman points out, it is now the independent film companies, not the 
major studios, that are providing women with their best star turns. Among Fine 
Line's year-end releases are two films with potential best actress roles: 
Jennifer Jason Leigh as Dorothy Parker in "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" 
and Sigourney Weaver in Roman Polanski's adaptation of the political drama 
"Death and the Maiden." 
</P>
<P>
 Other independent companies who are jumping into the breach include the Samuel 
Goldwyn Co., which is offering Marisa Tomei in Mira Nair's "The Perez Family" 
as a possible candidate, says the company's vice president of theatrical 
distribution, Eamonn Bowles. And according to a Miramax spokesperson, the 
company is touting a trio of actresses all of whom have previously been 
nominated for or won Oscars: Miranda Richardson in the drama "Tom and Viv," the 
late Jessica Tandy in the drama "Camilla" opposite Hume Cronyn, and Isabella 
Adjani in the title role of "Queen Margot."*

 In lieu of any Python reunions, the cult will have to make do with "Monty 
Python's Complete Waste of Time," a CD-ROM that has just been issued (in 
Windows format only, so far) and already taken its place as one of the most 
delightful uses of that particular home-computer format yet. It uses clips from 
the TV show and original game animations that the producers put together from 
cutouts lying around Terry Gilliam's basement, with minor new vocal and/or 
writing contributions from all the Pythons save for John Cleese. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's presented in such a ludicrously different way that it's really like 
seeing a new Python show," enthuses Terry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliam believes the CD-ROM format is peculiarly well-suited for recycling 
Python. "It's kind of like the shows, where anything can happen, both linearly 
and spatially -- it goes in all directions. It's actually got an extra 
dimension the television shows don't have. I love the randomness of the thing. 
. . . Because in a way it's the way my brain works, it just happens to match up 
with the same kind of synaptic, neuronic structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new technology that's fun to begin to learn, and then to think how you 
deal with it. Because Python wasn't happening in limbo. It was within the world 
of television, and using television forms and shifting them around. Then when 
we moved into films, we were trying to do it with 'Holy Grail,' twisting film a 
bit, with endings where the policeman blocks the film and it runs out. Things 
like that, you're playing with the medium itself. And I think CD-ROM is a 
really intriguing medium that one could do a lot with. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand," he adds cautiously, "it may just all be about form and no 
content. So I'm never certain about it." 
</P>
<P>
 For Michael Palin, contributing presented a kind of queasy nostalgia: "I did 
some voices for it, which was very strange. There was a time 25 years ago when 
Terry Gilliam used to come around with his tape recorder to anyone's house and 
just record odd voices and lines which he then used in the animation. And as I 
lived closest to Terry, he tended to come here first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working with Bob Ezrin (co-founder of CD-ROM company 7th Level), he came 
around with a tape recorder and we did exactly the same thing, saying silly 
lines in a variety of silly voices. It was sort of like going back 25 years 
more than anything else I've done." 
</P>
<P>
 He makes it sound as if the de ja vu were a little uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Um, well, it was strange, really," says Palin. "It was like putting me in 
short trousers and having the headmaster of my prep school tell me about sex 
again. It was something I thought I'd got through." Chris Willman

HITTING HOME IN THE HEARTLAND; CHERYL L. WEST, A RATHER CALM AND QUIET 
MIDWESTERNER, IS FILLING STAGES FROM COAST TO COAST WITH FIERY, OUTRAGEOUS 
CHARACTERS WHO HAVE NO TROUBLE SPEAKING THEIR MINDS.

<P>
 Today is playwright Cheryl L. West's 38th birthday. It has been eight years 
since the former social worker from Chicago -- who chose that profession 
because of her mother's admonition to always have "something to fall back on" 
-- gave herself "permission to write." And even in taking that risk, West 
exhibited a hint of her mother's practicality: If she wasn't making a living at 
it by 35, West planned to relegate writing to the category of a beloved hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always done things on sort of a time schedule," West said by phone from 
her home in Champaign, Ill., in a breathy, girlish voice that belies her quiet 
determination. "Like, I have three (academic) degrees, and I've always done it 
like: 'By this time I'll have this , by this time I'll have that . I've kind of 
planned things out that way -- that way I don't get overwrought as easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it (writing) was something I would always love to do, but I wasn't 
going to try to make a living at it. But when I turned 35, I was making a 
living at it," West said, sounding a little surprised even three years later. 
"So it really did work out." 
</P>
<P>
 West's description of her current creative status as "making a living" is 
modest, to put it mildly. 
</P>
<P>
 Her critically acclaimed play "Jar the Floor," a study of four generations of 
African American women reuniting for the great-grandmother MaDear's 90th 
birthday, opens Nov. 4 at Costa Mesa's South Coast Repertory's Second Stage 
(previews begin Nov. 1) after successful productions at San Diego's Old Globe 
Theatre, Arena Stage and Cleveland Play House and New York's Syracuse Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse Stage also hosted the January premiere of West's "Holiday Heart," the 
story of a girl from Chicago's South Side being brought up by a drug-addicted 
mother. "Ms. West is still learning her way about a stage," wrote the New York 
Times of that production. "But she's already proved herself something of a 
daredevil, who has no qualms about writing big, gutsy confrontations." 
</P>
<P>
 West just sent her newest play, "Puddin' and Pete," a "marriage fable" which 
premiered at Chicago's Goodman Theater, off to the Old Globe, where it is 
scheduled to open in a revised version sometime next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 West's first play, "Before It Hits Home," about the impact of the AIDS crisis 
on a black family, earned West the 1992 Helen Hayes-Charles MacArthur Award for 
outstanding new play produced in Washington, D.C. and several other awards, and 
has been optioned for a film by Spike Lee. West is also adapting a book for HBO 
and has a project in development with Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions. ("It's 
for film, that's all they'll allow me to say.") 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 West has observed that while "Jar the Floor" deals with a group of women, and 
African American women specifically, the play has struck a chord with a diverse 
audience, and, surprisingly, with men. Like "Holiday Heart," it's a play filled 
with "big, gutsy confrontations," outrageous characters, and sometimes equally 
outrageous language. West says she makes it all palatable with a heavy dose of 
humor. As extreme as her characters sometimes get, she noted that at any given 
time on stage, at least one of them manages to maintain the voice of reason. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Arena Stage, for example, West said many audience members were 
middle-aged, conservative and Caucasian -- but the play hit home nonetheless. 
"People were trying to bribe my agents, trying to buy a copy, (saying) their 
therapist said they had to get a copy," she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "MaDear has a very telling line -- in her experience, no house is big enough 
for two women. No house is big enough for two women -- and you have four women 
who have to be there together," West continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are just some universal truths; people are either children, or 
parents -- or both. I think there is something that's in there that people can 
really relate to, and are trying to reconcile with. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think it is just as moving for men. When you think of an all-women's 
play, you think it is going to communicate only to women, but I have seen many 
men come out and be very moved and shaken by it. I think for many men it is 
like being a voyeur, a fly on the wall: 'Is this the way women talk when men 
are not around?"' 
</P>
<P>
 West said none of the characters on stage represent herself or members of her 
own family. "Usually, your life is not that interesting, at least not so 
compelling that people should spend $20 or $30 for a ticket," she said. "What 
makes something work is the imagination. (People who write their own lives), 
those are the people who only have one play, or one movie or one book in them," 
she continued. "What else are you going to offer people? For me, it's important 
to stay away from your life as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 O ne aspect of her own life West does want to preserve in her work, however, 
is a Midwestern sensibility. "I think that certainly there is something about 
the language you learn when you are from the Midwest or the South," said West, 
whose family migrated to Chicago from Mississippi. "The way you turn a phrase . 
. . it's sort of your eyeglasses , the way you see the world." 
</P>
<P>
 West intends to continue to see the world from Illinois, thank you. She opted 
to live in Champaign -- home of the University of Illinois, where she received 
one of her multiple academic degrees -- because it was close to her family in 
Chicago, and offered both a small-town feel and college-town cosmopolitanism. 
She's amused that people don't see why she would stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spike Lee asked me that -- every time I meet somebody in producing, they are 
asking, 'What are you doing in Champaign?' And I always tell them: 'Living.' " 
West laughed. "I'm living on my own terms. I can still do work for people in 
New York, or Los Angeles, but I can have a style of living that I like. And I 
think it keeps my voice. I keep it by living the way I want to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to New York and met with some producers, and they said: 'She seems so 
normal .' Part of that (surprise) comes from people who read my work and expect 
me to be as fiery as the work is. I tend to be a lot calmer. And I think it's 
because I can make my characters as wild and crazy as I want to, so that keeps 
me calm. But I think maybe it also has to do with not being part of that rat 
race, that urban energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they are from the East Coast, West Coast, or spaces in between, West 
hopes audiences will leave the theater and go home to talk to their mothers. "I 
think that, until you know your mother's history, you really can't forgive her, 
and if you can't forgive her, you can't end up being friends," West mused. 
"Every mother was once a daughter -- she's not just your mother. That 
knowledge, I think, is so transforming.  
</P>
<P>
 "These women, they were missing pieces that they didn't share with each other. 
When you start to look at each other as people, not the roles you have been 
given, there is an opportunity for growth and connection."*

A BARITONE SEEKS HIS OWN VOICE; L.A. OPERA'S SENIOR RESIDENT ARTIST MAY BE 
FAMILIAR TO FANS, BUT AFTER 'XERXES,' IT'LL BE CAREER DECISION-MAKING TIME FOR 
BARITONE JOHN ATKINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 See him once and he's a bohemian artisan in a Parisian garret. Next time, he's 
the diplomat who smoothes the way for a cad named Pinkerton. Catch him yet 
again and he's a rube who gets in the way of a master womanizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Baritone John Atkins is one of the most familiar faces of the Los Angeles 
Music Center Opera. As the company's most senior resident artist, he has graced 
the boards of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in a wide variety of guises since 
joining the company in its second season in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently sang Masetto in "Don Giovanni," as well as five characters last 
season, including Schaunard in "La Boheme," Sharpless in "Madama Butterfly" and 
Caireles in "El Gato Montes." Next, Atkins appears in Handel's "Xerxes," which 
opens on Saturday. (The fourth production of the L.A. Opera season is also part 
of the ongoing UK/LA festival of British arts.) 
</P>
<P>
 A 1988 national finalist in the Metropolitan Opera auditions, Atkins, 36, has 
won a following since he's been here. "Any good acting comes from good 
thinking," says "Xerxes" conductor Roderick Brydon, who's also worked with 
Atkins on three previous productions. "John has an immense mental energy and a 
very active mind which conducts itself into physical acting on the stage." 
</P>
<P>
 As one of L.A. Opera's resident artists, Atkins is one of a half-dozen 
emerging talents whom the company keeps on salary for 18 or more weeks each 
season. (This year there are six; some years up to seven resident artists have 
been with the company). Yet after "Xerxes" and February's staging of Debussy's 
"Pelleas and Melisande," Atkins will no longer be a resident artist, although 
he's likely to continue to perform in L.A. The change, which was a mutual 
decision on the part of the artist and opera, reflects the singer's need to 
perform leading roles on a more consistent basis.  
</P>
<P>
 Given that a career Rubicon now looms, Atkins is doing some thinking about 
whether career-wise his time here has been well spent. "It's a double-edged 
sword," Atkins says. "There's enough work here that you don't have to work 
anywhere else. On the other hand, most of the auditions for opera singers are 
held in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 "When work was available here, I took it," Atkins said. "Clearly I was giving 
something up in order to do that. I don't know if it will have been the right 
choice to stay here for eight years. Ask me in five years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins has matured right along with the L.A. Opera. "When I first came here, 
we were all flying by the seat of our pants and everything was a scramble," he 
says. "There was no set way of doing things. There was a certain mess about the 
company. It was running on energy, but it had to run on energy because it 
couldn't run on cash or its laurels." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the company is in its ninth season, it has settled into a groove. 
"We're certainly moving into another phase of the company's existence," Atkins 
says. "Things are much more comfortable now because there are processes in 
place. Costume fittings happen at the costume shop. Payroll is always on time." 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins has been praised for both his acting skills and his singing: "Often 
singers can either (sing or act) well," says conductor Brydon, who's worked 
with Atkins on "Idomeneo," "Albert Herring" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream." 
"With good actor-singers, the combination is impressive. People notice it 
straight away." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those noticing Atkins has been Times music critic Martin Bernheimer, who 
called Atkins' Marullo in "Rigoletto" "incisive," his Schaunard in "La Boheme" 
"sensitive" and said he was "deft as always" in "El Gato Montes." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Atkins has also developed a reputation as a team player. "He has a 
very attractive personality," says Brydon. "That makes a big difference to the 
psychological aspect, in terms of what he projects onstage, and also in the 
rehearsal room." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great joy in the work and he's a direct person," Brydon continues. 
"There's never any nonsense, ego or jostling for position. I find that 
refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
 It's one reason Brydon is pleased to be working with Atkins yet again in the 
upcoming "Xerxes." The infrequently staged Handel opera tells the story of a 
young king who falls in love with his brother's fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In director-translator Stephen Wadsworth's staging, Atkins plays King Xerxes' 
manservant Elviro. "It's an interesting role for me because it's a comic 
character, which I've not had the opportunity to do much here," he says. "I 
feel like it's something that I'm well-suited to." 
</P>
<P>
 It's "the real buffo role" in the comic opera, according to Brydon. "(Elviro) 
is the perfect foil for his master and John uses the opportunity. (His 
performance) is never camp. It's just very lively, intelligent acting." 
</P>
<P>
 That his approach is thoughtful should come as no surprise, given Atkins' 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New Mexico and reared in small towns in Oklahoma, Atkins is the second 
son of a Methodist preacher father and a schoolteacher mother. (His older 
brother, an attorney, died of a heart attack last November.) 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins grew up singing in church. "Had Dad been a banker, a ditchdigger or any 
number of other things, it might not have been as natural for me to sing," he 
says. "But because he was in the public eye, onstage every Sunday, it was 
natural for me to be a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 He attended Oklahoma City University, where he came under the tutelage of a 
voice teacher named Dr. Inez Silberg, whom he credits with giving him the 
foundation of his dramatic approach. "In any two or three lessons about voice, 
every other lesson was about the words," he recalls. "It had everything to do 
with interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins went from Oklahoma to a summer with the Santa Fe Opera, and from there 
to a stint with the traveling Texas Opera Theater. The following summer he 
returned to Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
 The following fall, Atkins moved to New York, and he's worked steadily since. 
He relocated to L.A. in 1987, with a contract in hand for 13 weeks, including 
roles in "La Boheme," "The Fiery Angel" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream."  
</P>
<P>
 D uring his extended tenure here, he's been able to learn from more 
experienced performers. "To watch Tom Allen rehearse and then do five 
performances of 'Don Giovanni' and to see how different his performances are is 
an experience you can't buy," Atkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for him now is to move into performing leading roles with 
greater frequency with other companies, but it's not an easy time to be doing 
that. "The last few years have been a hard time to be a singer," says the 
baritone, who took his first turn as the lead in "Don Giovanni" in Stockton 
last spring. "There've been a lot of canceled performances because the economy 
has been down and that means there is less work to go around." 
</P>
<P>
 That also means he's expecting to have to be flexible. "I would be happy to 
live in L.A., the ground shaking notwithstanding," Atkins says. "If I need to 
move back to New York, I'll do that. I've also thought there's a lot about 
Europe that's appealing." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the uncertainty, Atkins sees this juncture as an opportunity. 
"It's exactly the right thing for me to do at this time," he says. "It's 
terrifying and exhilarating at the same time."* Vital Stats

MASTER OF THE ARCANE; NEARLY TWO DECADES AFTER HIS FIRST SHOW AT LACMA, R. B. 
KITAJ IS BACK WITH A MAJOR RETROSPECTIVE WITH NODS TO OLD MASTERS FROM 
REMBRANDT TO CEZANNE.

 It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. That's what comes to mind 
when writing about R.B. Kitaj. The celebrated 61-year-old American artist, who 
has lived mostly in London since 1957, is being honored for his life's work in 
a retrospective organized by the Tate Gallery. After unusually high attendance 
-- more than 40,000 visitors -- during its summer debut in London, it comes to 
the L.A. County Museum of Art today as part of the wide-ranging UK/LA 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj might be exultant over this achievement if not for a recent series of 
personal blows. Last month, his wife, painter Sandra Fisher, died of a stroke. 
She was 47 -- it was a second marriage for Kitaj -- and their son Max is 9. 
Kitaj's first wife also died quite young. 
</P>
<P>
 It was added pressure for Kitaj, whose mother, 84, a resident of Los Angeles, 
had been in serious condition with an illness at Century City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the exhibition he wants to consider his moment of glory has been 
fraught with controversy. Although it drew tremendous popular response, the 
exhibition was as lambasted as it was praised by the London critics. The first 
edition of the catalogue sold out and is in its second printing.  
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj, a slight man with close-cropped white hair and a restless intelligence, 
speaks with an emphatically midwestern-American accent, as though determined to 
resist the influence of his adopted home. He is angry about what he considers 
shoddy treatment by certain critics and blames it on a laundry list of old 
grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a shooting war of proportions I didn't expect. You get used to 
that," he says. But after a pause, he adds, "Though you never really get used 
to it. I felt like fighting back, but friends like (David) Hockney would say 
'Don't do it. You don't want to make a third-rate hack into another John 
Ruskin' " -- a reference to that writer's war with American artist James 
McNeill Whistler in the late 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj speculates that certain critics have an agenda, and he gains solace by 
viewing himself in the mirror of art history: "You have to look at history and 
its precedents," Kitaj says. "Manet was abused and savaged by the press. 
Baudelaire wrote to him saying, 'It seems you have the honor to be hated.' 
Cezanne was abused and humiliated. These are great artists. I'm not a great 
artist, but I've been attacked all my life because I don't do what I'm expected 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been born in the century of the autonomous art object, when you are not 
supposed to care or know about anything extraneous to that which you hang on 
the wall," he continues. Kitaj has confronted that proposition by writing about 
his own work in catalogues and manifestoes. In this exhibition's catalogue, he 
relays his theories along with anecdotes about his life.  
</P>
<P>
 "All modern art is difficult. I don't see anything wrong with the artist 
remarking on what he is doing. Life isn't pure, and I don't see why pictures 
should be," he explains.  
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj has been interested in the relationship between literature and imagery 
since the early '60s, when he was labeled a leader of the British Pop Art 
movement. In fact, his admiration for literature, particularly that of 
American-born poets T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, who lived in England for so 
many years, inspired him to move to that country. In one painting, "If Not, 
Not," Kitaj is said to have accomplished in paint what Eliot did in his poem 
"The Wasteland." 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj explains: "To me, books are what trees have been to a landscape painter. 
I've never met an artist of consequence who wasn't an erudite, vast reader of 
literature. Yet, there is always an attack on the literary aspect of my work. A 
lot of people find my pictures too difficult, too obscure, too arcane."  
</P>
<P>
 Even before its controversial reception in London, the Kitaj presentation at 
LACMA was faced with problems. In 1992, then-director Michael Shapiro, citing 
budget cuts, peremptorily eliminated it from the schedule of upcoming shows 
without discussing the matter with either of the co-hosting institutions, the 
Tate Gallery and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 LACMA curator Maurice Tuchman, who was under fire from Shapiro, has been a 
longtime supporter of Kitaj, and many felt the decision was part of a form of 
institutional politics. Kitaj had had an association with the museum dating to 
1965, when Tuchman gave the nearly unknown artist an exhibition at LACMA. Kitaj 
also participated in the famed "Art and Technology" show there. Shapiro 
underestimated Kitaj's popularity in Los Angeles -- David Hockney and others 
protested. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was reinstated when it secured full financing from EXOR-America 
(Agnelli Group). For a number of reasons, Shapiro announced his resignation in 
1993. Coordinator of Curatorial Affairs Stephanie Barron is now shepherding the 
exhibition.  
</P>
<P>
 This retrospective of approxi mately 100 drawings, paintings and collages 
traces the changeable nature of Kitaj's art, beginning with his interest in 
popular culture and film in the '60s. Filmmaker Peter Greenaway remembers him 
as an important influence on his thinking as an art student. "Kitaj legitimized 
text; he legitimized arcane and elitist information; he drew and painted in as 
many as 10 different ways on the same canvas; he threw ideas around, like 
confetti," Greenaway is quoted as saying in the catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '70s, inspired by his new partner Sandra Fisher, Kitaj turned his back 
on collage and dedicated himself to classical methods of drawing. He published 
writings that were critical of the closed system, as he saw it, that modern art 
had become. 
</P>
<P>
 Fascinated by his Jewish background, in the '80s he pursued paintings about 
Semitic culture and art history, topics that inform his paintings to this day. 
His paintings embrace issues that have come to be seen as post-modern, but 
Kitaj rejects the requisite irony. 
</P>
<P>
 Each work in exhibition is uniquely Kitaj, but he obviously quotes from 
Surrealism and Realism, from Max Beckmann and Cezanne. The sensitive drawings 
owe their debt to Degas; the emotional and chaotic compositions recall Van 
Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj would be the first to admit this. He considers his work to be a dialogue 
with the painters and paintings of the last century. When asked about his 
stylistic variety, from the meticulous figure studies to the unfinished and 
disjunctive paintings, he explains, "People are so used to signature styles, 
like Warhol or Rothko. But I never wanted to live my life that way. What has 
always intrigued me were the protean possibilities. I wake up in the morning 
and do whatever I like. Warhol could not wake up in the morning and make a 
fantastic drawing of a friend. Picasso could. Matisse could. It is no 
coincidence that the two greatest modernists happen to be the two greatest 
draftsmen of the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Critic Robert Hughes once said that Kitaj "draws better than almost anyone 
alive." The artist defends drawing with a vigor rarely heard these days. "I 
tell kids if you want to be an artist get on a plane and go to Barcelona to the 
Picasso museum and see the work he did between the ages of 9 and 20. You'll see 
what you have to do to be a great artist. Few people know that Matisse was an 
art student for 10 years or more. It's very hard to achieve a memorable 
picture. David (Hockney) is the greatest natural draftsman alive. He's a 
natural. Whether I am or not, I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows what would have happened even to Picasso or Matisse if they were 
faced with all the alternatives of today?" he adds. "If those people were faced 
with the fact that you could stand on your head and jerk off, or place a 
thousand umbrellas in a canyon, or put 100 repetitious photographs on a wall, 
if all those alternatives had been available, who knows if they would have been 
glamorized the way Duchamp, Beuys and Warhol are? 
</P>
<P>
 "What fascinated me in the controversy (around the exhibition) was, when we 
say reactionary we usually are talking about conservative reactionaries who 
support academic art. But now I think we have modernist reactionaries who are 
stuck in formalist modernism. And you have avant-garde reactionaries, people 
who only know about Joseph Beuys, and to them that is the cutting edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole concept of life is based on the idea of liberty. People should do 
whatever the hell they want to do if they are not hurting anybody. I made a lot 
of enemies in the early '70s saying it was sad that this great tradition (of 
drawing and painting) since the caves had gone down because they were not 
teaching drawing in schools anymore, in America especially. 
</P>
<P>
 "Degas said the reason for the high quality of art at the end of the last 
century was the example of Ingres," continues Kitaj. "He meant that everyone 
was taught to draw at that level. So the ones with talent will out. Before the 
Second World War, the average convent girl of 18 could draw rings around the 
hotshot painters in New York and Germany today."  
</P>
<P>
 K itaj considers L.A. to be a second home and comes here every year to visit 
family and friends. His mother, his son from his first marriage and his 
grandson live here. His son, Lem Dobbs, is a screenwriter whose credits include 
the recent movie "Kafka" -- an author who had a tremendous influence on Kitaj's 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj met his late wife in L.A. in 1970 when she was working for Gemini 
G.E.L., a West Hollywood printmaking studio, and he was here to teach at UCLA. 
"She was a radiant, marvelous person," he says sadly. Although partners for 
nearly a quarter of a century, they were married in 1983 -- an event that 
prompted a painting included in the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to become a young mom all of sudden," he says, disconsolately 
referring to his new role as a single parent. "This focused my mind. I want to 
be near my family and plan to start spending half the year in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 During his stay in L.A., Kitaj sketched portraits of some of the great 
directors like Reuben Mamoulian, Henry Hathaway, Billy Wilder and Jean Renoir. 
The painting "John Ford on his Death Bed" was completed 15 years after the 
artist and his first son visited Ford. "He was wearing an admiral's bridge cap 
he'd been given for filming 'Midway.' He said, 'Too bad you guys just got here. 
The Duke just left.' John Wayne! We almost died." 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj seems to feel older than his 61 years. He had a mild heart attack four 
years ago and now has healthier habits of exercise and diet. "I'm considered a 
prime candidate because I'm pessimistic and melancholic. But Hockney is the 
opposite, and one year later he got a heart attack. So did (writer) Philip 
Roth, who had been doing all the right things, eating fish, walking five miles 
a day. So one learned that the heart is a mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 A lively raconteur, Kitaj admires the traditions of intellectual discourse and 
distinct points of view. If, as it is said, one can be judged by the company 
one keeps, he must be valued quite highly. He is close to leading British 
figure painters -- Lucian Freud, Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff -- as well as 
many writers. Roth was his neighbor for many years and remains a friend. He has 
done a portrait of Roth, as well as of Robert Creeley, John Ashbery and John 
Golding. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj's wit, his intellectual depth and breadth are the result of disciplined 
self-schooling, for his background was not one of abundance. Kitaj, as many a 
successful artist, is self-invented. Though born Ronald Brooks in Cleveland, he 
told people for years that he was from Chagrin Falls, the birthplace of Hart 
Crane, because he thought it more poetic. (He is still friends with actor Joel 
Grey, whom he has known since his elementary school years in Cleveland.) 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj's father abandoned the family when Kitaj was 2, and his mother, daughter 
of Russian Jews, went to work as a secretary until she married a research 
chemist from Vienna, Dr. Walter Kitaj. As an indication of the fondness he felt 
for his stepfather, the artist took his last name and became known to all 
simply as "Kitaj." As he had no religious training as a child, he finds himself 
bemused by his own turning to Judaism in middle age. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj was introduced to culture at the Cleveland Museum, by taking art classes 
there on Saturdays, and he still remembers favorite pictures like Picasso's "La 
Vie." He escaped his Midwestern life at age 16 when he went to sea to work the 
merchant ships. After 10 years of working at sea and drawing or painting such 
experiences as visiting prostitutes in Havana, he started studies at the Cooper 
Union in New York in 1954. The Abstract Expressionists were at the height of 
their power, and there is an obvious resemblance between his earliest drawings 
and those of De Kooning. He was soon drafted into the U.S. Army and when 
released, studied art in Vienna and then at the Ruskin School of Drawing at 
Oxford. The Ruskin Master at the Ashmolean Museum suggested that Kitaj apply 
for the Royal College of Art. He was one of about 20 students accepted in 1959, 
along with Hockney. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj remembers their meeting: "I saw this boy making the most beautiful 
drawing of a skeleton. I said, 'I'll give you five quid for that.' All I had 
was $150 a month from the G.I. Bill to support me and my family, so five quid 
was a lot of money. You could feed your family for a week on that. Then I 
bought the next one and the next one. I still have them all. We've been like 
brothers ever since. I've always liked to collect pictures by my 
contemporaries. Within a very short time, the spotlight was on us, and I could 
sell pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 Of that period, critic John Russell wrote: "If I had to choose the artist who 
preeminently represents the open situation, I should probably single out R.B. 
Kitaj. . . . I know of no painter now living from whom we can expect more." 
</P>
<P>
 The Marlborough Gallery in London and New York has represented Kitaj since 
1963. "The Ohio Gang," shown in his 1965 exhibition there, was purchased by 
Alfred Barr for the Museum of Modern Art. He has supported himself through 
sales ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj works slowly and deliberately to produce six pictures a year. He takes a 
dim view of artists who come out with several exhibitions a year. "Everybody 
has got to have an exhibition every year, or if you're Julian Schnabel, 10 
exhibitions all at the same time. OK, maybe he is a natural and can be that 
spontaneous. But one gets a little suspicious when everybody's that 
spontaneous." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his career-long battle with the critics, he ultimately recognizes his 
good fortune as an artist. "What I do infuriates a good part of the art world. 
I'm talking about the art world, not audiences or people who like art in a 
different way. But the Tate buys a picture every half decade. I've lived off 
the sales of my work. How many people can do that? I've had more than my share 
of the pie. I've led a charmed life."* Vital Stats

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; BY GEORGE; HE'S A CELEBRITY, A PAPERBOY AND A BIT OF A 
ROGUE. HE'S GEORGE SCOTT -- CATALINA'S CANKEROUS CHARACTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rusty Jeep in George Scott's driveway is acting as irascible as its owner, 
a cantankerous old codger refusing to move at any speed but its own, sassing 
the world in a series of clanks, sputters and spits. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything about the gas guzzler looks shiftless, like a shell that's left 
over after a hard night's carousing. For one, its steering wheel is on the 
wrong side. Its body is white on top and a sick Rustoleum green down below, as 
though some blind man with a brush foolishly tried to gloss over its 
imperfections. 
</P>
<P>
 And while it may be another day here in paradise, the man who calls himself as 
the oldest paperboy on the planet has a real problem: The dailies have arrived 
late by air from the mainland. Down at the pier, anxious customers wander 
aimlessly, awaiting their news fix. 
</P>
<P>
 So Nelly here picks this day to act like the crotchety old pack mule that she 
is. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Jeep here fits right in with the guy driving," Scott says, removing his 
signature cowboy hat with the sweat-stained band. "It does what it dang well 
pleases. I keep it looking this run-down for reasons of taxes and thievery. And 
frankly, sometimes I think it gets mad at me." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, he rumbles down a pock-marked dirt road, his sometimes-loyal 
Jeep buried under a mountain of bundled newspapers -- an Okie wagon headed for 
the Promised Land. As the contraption backfires its way down Catalina Avenue 
toward the newspaper vending boxes, onlookers stop to watch and smile. For 
nearly 50 years now, Scott, his newspapers, and his goofball humor and homespun 
philosophies have been familiar entertainment on this tiny island, making 
people laugh at themselves -- but mostly at George. 
</P>
<P>
 A happy-go-lucky party boy who first landed in Avalon in 1947 as a semi-pro 
softball pitcher, Scott immediately found his spiritual home here, sticking to 
the place like a crusty old barnacle -- each night shooting the breeze at his 
designated park bench near the town's picturesque pier, engaging locals and 
tourists alike. 
</P>
<P>
 But just being a character has never been enough for Scott, who refuses to 
give his real age, insisting that he was "born in the year of Our Lord." 
(Speculating locals pose wild, blundering guesses -- from 55 clear up to the 
80s.) He has put his gum-flapping to work, serving four terms as a city 
councilman and two as mayor of the island burg -- 26 miles and an entire world 
off the mainland. Now he's at it again. Defeated in April in his bid for a 
third mayoral term, Scott is now eyeing the City Council seat vacated by the 
man who beat him, to be decided in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, George is running. Again," says a county sheriff's deputy on foot 
patrol near the pier. "Running for office is just a normal thing for George to 
do. Everybody knows how he just craves the limelight. He thrives on it. We just 
thank God there's only one George Scott around here. This island couldn't 
handle two of them." 
</P>
<P>
 And now, thanks to a series of quirky regional television commercials for Jeep 
featuring some of his classic one-liners and off-the-cuff nonsense, Scott has a 
newfound celebrity status -- not only among locals but also the hoards of 
tourists who flock here each weekend. Shot on location in Avalon, the bits show 
Scott selling Jeep wagons with the panache of an island Cal Worthington. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, tourists yell, "Hey, George!" and "Way to go, Georgie boy!" And 
while he has always considered himself a ladies' man, Scott never anticipated 
this: Old friends -- and girlfriends -- have looked him up. Total strangers -- 
many of them girls young enough to be his grandchildren -- approach him on the 
street for a hug, a kiss, a back slap or high-five. People like Lin Forino, an 
Orange County tourist who hailed down Scott as he folded papers: "George, I've 
got to hand it to you, you're your own man. I admire your spirit. When I saw 
you and your Jeep, I just had to take a picture. Do you mind?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a faded T-shirt with the words "Help Stamp out Footprints," baggy 
blue jeans with rolled-up cuffs and, of course, that hat, Scott smiles his best 
campaign smile. "Do I mind?" he asks in a voice as gravelly as a Santa Catalina 
back road. "Hell, I love the attention!" 
</P>
<P>
 Some say Scott's quest for yet another public office is all about just that -- 
attention. Although some applaud his seemingly insatiable civic appetite, 
others believe he ought to let some younger candidates take a shot at local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's loony, he's a fruitcake, he's crazy," says one elderly woman voter 
parked on a downtown bench. "I wouldn't vote for George Scott in a million 
years. Are you kidding?" 
</P>
<P>
 But barber Frank Saldana would: "We need politicians like George Scott, he's a 
regular guy," Saldana says. "He's always frank with you. He doesn't run and 
hide like the rest. George is comfortable with both paupers and kings. Hell, I 
knew him before he started drinking. And that was a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott acknowledges that he has made enemies as well as friends over the years. 
"Yeah, some people just don't like me," he says, shoveling down a plate of 
scrambled eggs at a waffle house. "It's just that lots of folks don't have a 
sense of humor. They look at you and just see a character. They don't look deep 
enough to see who you really are, see what you stand for." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if you're a merchant, it may be inadvisable to let on that you back 
George Scott. Some who do have taken out anonymous full-page ads in the local 
paper rather than hang his campaign posters in their shops. 
</P>
<P>
 His critics include Councilman Keith LeFever, who doesn't care much for either 
Scott or the way he burst into a recent council meeting, informing that members 
they were a clueless bunch of greenhorns. 
</P>
<P>
 "George Scott's time has come and gone," LeFever says after the pair ran into 
each other on the street, snarling as usual. "Every election he gets fewer and 
fewer votes. He's just an old-time politician without an eye to the future to 
see what will make this city prosper." 
</P>
<P>
 His supporters disagree. Scott, they say, has always represented Catalina's 
common man -- the island's working-class bartenders and waitresses -- not just 
the wealthy elite with homes in Avalon and Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 As mayor, Scott helped paved the way for 80 middle- and low-income housing 
units. He fought runaway development and supported a plan to save residents 
money by converting the sewage system from fresh water to salt water -- trying 
to preserve the Avalon he met all those years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "George Scott is for the little man, the island family without the money and 
power of the big guys," says resident Betty Stein. "And he's always done it 
with a sense of humor. All I can say is that I've never seen the man when he 
hasn't made me feel good, when he hasn't made me laugh -- even when we've come 
down on opposite sides of the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 But Avalon is changing. The town of 3,000 people has a $12-million budget. 
Rising property values and rents have driven young working-class folks off the 
island. All the more the reason to seek office again and keep elitists from 
running the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want to see this place change," Scott says. "Santa Catalina is 
such a romantic isle. People come here to get married. They write songs about 
the place. I want to keep it that way, to protect it from those who come and 
see this wonderful island with its quaint little houses and blue sea, a place 
where you can sit on a bench unmolested at 3 a.m. Because (the rich) are the 
same people who immediately want to change things here." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, he says, they've got to get past George Scott first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, you've got to have at least a little change," he says. "But you can't 
steal the soul of this beautiful place. You just can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 George Scott's in big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, it's not his fault the papers got fogged in on the mainland. The way 
Scott tells it, the bundles land regular-like at the inland airport every day: 
Between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Try telling that to his 300 customers, many of whom gather at the news boxes 
like sea gulls for a feed, looking for the Long Beach Press-Telegram, the 
Orange County Register and the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one thankless business. "It's a lot of pressure," he mutters, peddle 
to the metal -- the Jeep slouching toward the boardwalk at 25 m.p.h. "No doubt 
they'll assume I was out drinking again." 
</P>
<P>
 It is nearly noon as the Jeep wades through a pierside crowd. Pastor Lopez, 
one of Scott's elfin helpers, awaits him, knife drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whaddya do George, go back to bed?" he says. Scott ignores him. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who met Scott when he opened an Avalon bookstore called Scott's Manor 
more than two generations ago, knows his friend better than yesterday's news -- 
insisting that it's he who does the work while Scott runs his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Tom Sawyer with a 5 o'clock shadow has an army of helpers -- most 
of them retirees, he says, with little else to do -- who fold his papers, give 
out change and load his newsstands. All the while, Scott shares a laugh with a 
passing tourist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me a roll of duct tape and I'll tape his mouth shut," Lopez says. "Heck, 
I'm George Scott's baby-sitter. See, he never really grew up mentally. He's 
always been the comedian. Or, at least he thinks he is. He's like a parrot, all 
talk. But I'll tell you, George being George is a very funny thing to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's humor is in-your-face, the kind that comes from years of sitting in 
bars trying to impress barmaids or being perched on the beach, cat-calling to 
two women lounging on the next blanket. Sitting on his bench each night, 
watching the world go by, he'll grab the hand of a passerby and refuse to let 
go, saying, "Let go of me!" 
</P>
<P>
 And he always looks you straight in the eye, mainly because he can't move his 
neck too well since an accident threw him through a car windshield. But things 
still work OK from there on up, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the blue, Scott will dream up some goofball line like: "When all is 
finally said and done, there's nothing left to do or say." Or, "I haven't had a 
drink since Thursday. And I don't miss it one bit." 
</P>
<P>
 He cracks jokes to make himself laugh. "I do it all for fun -- for the fun of 
me," he says, "because I'm a fellow who loves laughter." 
</P>
<P>
 That was obvious to the executives at Jeep, who chose Scott and a helicopter 
pilot over 300 others nationwide for their commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "George Scott was the most likable person out of the entire 300 -- and it 
didn't take us a lot of time to figure that out," says Darrell Lomas, creative 
director of the California office of Bozell/North, an advertising agency 
representing Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people magically stand out as characters, individualists. We just liked 
George's homespun little jokes and observations about life. The man is a 
crackup. But don't let him fool you. He's smart, real smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott has always been that way, friends say -- ever since he first appeared in 
Avalon in 1947 -- a teen-ager who grew up in Phoenix, whose treacherous 
sinker-ball made him by far the best pitcher on the island's softball team and 
in the entire league. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent those days chasing women, he says, as "a lipstick-taster for Max 
Factor."  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually married four times -- one of which he says lasted barely an hour -- 
Scott became an instant character in watering holes such as the Attic and the 
Marlin, where he would show up in a top hat to expound on his iconoclastic 
philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
 After he knocked back a few Scotch and milks -- his drink of choice back then 
-- the boys would load Scott into a plastic garbage can and haul him 
door-to-door so the whole town could hear his words of wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Sunday evening without fail, dressed in his hat and a white suit, with an 
old suitcase in his hand, Scott would run down the pier, yelling, "Stop! Stop!" 
to the day's last steamer -- until he plunged into the salty drink. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a regular audience. "I was never drunk when I made the run," he 
insists. "Of course, I'd been drinking all day." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, after the bookstore closed and his second marriage ended, the father 
of three -- two sons and a daughter -- took over as Catalina's sole newspaper 
distributor. Since then, he has tossed those papers rain or shine -- through 
four Jeeps, through Watergate and the Reagan-Bush years, through his two 
mayoral terms in the 1980s and four terms on the City Council between 1970 and 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't made him rich. Earning $12,000 a year, Scott often relies on the 
generosity of friends and strangers for lunch and dinner. When it rains, he's 
forced to wear those plastic-bag newspaper protectors for galoshes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily, somewhere along the way I lost the value of money," he says. "I make 
just enough to survive and that's just fine with me. I stayed with the 
newspapers because I figured that, even in another Great Depression, people 
would always have the money to buy a paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott didn't enter politics on his own accord: He was drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 One day over drinks at the Marlin in 1970, a few of the fellows talked him 
into filing candidacy for the City Council. The rest is a colorful chapter in 
Avalon history. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, in his first act as mayor, he installed a park bench that faced down 
the boardwalk, giving him a better view of people coming and going. "It could 
well be my biggest stroke of brilliance as mayor," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best place in town to people-watch and shoot the breeze. Whenever I 
go there, the guys will still move over and make room for me. That's quite an 
honor." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's the gregarious George Scott. The other is decidedly more private. 
In recent years, he says, after a stomach operation, he drinks only an 
occasional glass of wine. He allows no one inside his home, calling it his one 
place for peaceful respite. "I may be a mean old man at home," he says, "but 
I'm friendly as heck downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Coleman, Scott's estranged wife who still lives in Avalon, met him 
years ago as he walked, loudly dressed, along the boardwalk with a woman on 
each arm. When someone told her she had just passed Avalon's mayor, she said, 
"You've got to be kidding!" 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, the pair married. Coleman sees both sides of the gregarious 
Scott: "I love George. Everybody loves George. He'd do anything for anybody. 
Just don't get too close." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's late afternoon and the man who bills himself as "the world's greatest 
paper-thrower" is finally finishing his route. With an easy flip of the wrist, 
he tosses the papers from the driver's seat of his moving Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling his shots, he makes the papers bounce on concrete and slide under 
gates. Or sail in the air 100 feet, landing and staying put on the tiniest 
front porches. There are sinkers and curve balls -- and the occasional wild 
pitch that sends a paper clunking into the grille of some parked car. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, though, Scott is on target. "It's easy to brag after the fact," he 
says. "The real bragging comes when you can do it first." 
</P>
<P>
 It is on lazy Santa Catalina weekend afternoons such as this one that Scott 
looks back and laughs to himself over the stunts he's pulled. He has no 
regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe one. If he had to do it over again, he'd have told fewer jokes to 
his children, especially his son Blake. Years ago, when Blake asked his dad how 
old he was, Scott told him he was 113. The next day, the boy got into several 
fights at school defending his father's story. 
</P>
<P>
 The warhorse of a Jeep parked on a hillside overlooking the blue Pacific, 
Scott pauses, suddenly out of jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, I think I'm the luckiest guy in the world," he says. "I have at 
least a few good laughs every day. And if you don't have that, no matter how 
much money you've got, you're really a poor man." George Scott

SOMETHING FOR SINGLE PEOPLE TO CHEW ON . . .; FOOD: WHEN YOU LIVE ALONE, IT'S 
EASY TO DISREGARD A HEALTHY DIET. BUT A LITTLE CONTROL AND SOME WORK CAN MAKE 
GOOD NUTRITION A PART OF YOUR DAILY LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 You eat a light lunch and get home late from work. You're tired and famished, 
so you grab dinner -- cheese, crackers and a couple of glasses of wine. And 
since you live alone and nobody's looking . . . well, what the heck, why not 
polish off the pint of Cherry Garcia? 
</P>
<P>
 Many people who live by themselves find it difficult to shop, cook and pay 
attention to good nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, single people sometimes have the tendency to overeat, says 
Melanie Polk, nutritionist with the American Institute for Cancer Research. 
"Nobody's watching. The only person they have to account for is themselves, 
which for some people is a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Others eat while reading or watching television -- good for keeping you 
company but bad for mindless bingeing. "If you're not paying attention, you 
could down 500 to 1,000 calories without tasting a bite," says Katherine 
Tallmadge, a Washington, D.C. dietitian. "You also don't get the psychological 
satisfaction of eating a meal." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Tallmadge encourages her single clients to turn off the TV and 
put down the paper when they eat dinner. "When you eat, sit down, take a few 
deep breaths and relax." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, some go-it-aloners eat out of loneliness. Food is comfort, 
company and a reward. Tallmadge advises her clients to seek out non-food 
rewards every day. It could be any activity that makes you feel good, even if 
it lasts only a few minutes, says Tallmadge. Watch a sunset, take a bath, talk 
to a friend, flip through a favorite magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the going gets tough, just remember that living alone has many 
dietary advantages. "If you think living alone is hard," says Polk, "just think 
about how hard it would be if you had a saboteur offering you the choice of 
going out for a hot fudge sundae." 
</P>
<P>
 Single people also have more control over their schedules and mealtimes. "You 
don't have a husband who's going out for a business meeting or a kid with 
emergency band practice," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 So take advantage of it, stresses Polk. Plan ahead. Do a weekly shopping trip. 
Make healthful selections. "Otherwise, eating becomes haphazard, and when that 
happens, it's an invitation to disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some quick tips from Polk and others for avoiding disaster: 
</P>
<P>
 * Have a snack late in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 If you eat lunch between noon and 1:30, no wonder you're starving by dinner 
time. Buy a piece of fruit from a street vendor and eat it at 4 or 5 or just 
before you leave work. Then you won't walk in the house hungry enough to eat 
the rugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Control portions of carryout and delivery food. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of sight, out of mind. Before you eat the whole pizza, freeze half of it. 
"Manage what you're eating, rather than let the food manage you," says Polk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Explore foods that are perfect for one serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Microwave a giant sweet potato. Top a salmon steak with lemon pepper. Combine 
tortellini with frozen vegetables (keep a big bag of vegetables in the freezer, 
and take out just what you need); boil together and serve with a little 
marinara sauce or grated Parmesan. Make a French bread pizza: Split a baguette 
and spread with sauce, low-fat cheese and sliced mushrooms; cook in the toaster 
oven. Use the salad bar for making stir-fries, or add a small can of tuna to 
the bean or pasta salads. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eat breakfast for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with having cereal and fruit for dinner, says Rosemary 
Clifford, wellness coordinator of International Telecommunications Satellite 
Consortium's health promotion program. And don't forget about pancakes. Serve 
them with sliced bananas and blueberry syrup, or plain with a side dish of 
apples, sauteed in a non-stick pan with a dash of vanilla and cinnamon. 
</P>

OFFBEAT AFRICA; FOR THOSE WHO'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE, WHERE TO GO NOW? HERE, FOUR 
TRIPS OFF THE BEATEN TOURIST PATHS AND AWAY FROM THE MAIN SAFARI CROSSROADS.

 "Kilimanjaro or Zanzibar?" asked Keisha, our expedition guide. To climb 19,000 
feet for five frigid days, lose your meals to altitude sickness and perhaps not 
even reach the summit, or to slip on a sarong for a week of tropical nirvana. 
I, for one, knew which way the trade winds blew.  
</P>
<P>
 Nine adventurers on a trans-Africa trek, we chose Zanzibar, an Afro-Arab 
island that is part of the East African country of Tanzania. We were signed on 
with Dragoman, an overland tour company out of Suffolk, England, that runs 
five-week expeditions through the wild lands of eastern and southern Africa 
several times a year. British traveling companions, Aussies and New Zealanders 
made it a lively group; I was the only American. One of our company, Drew, was 
a sheep station foreman from Australia. Keisha, a petite Welsh woman raised in 
Namibia, was a masterful driver, yet the long, dusty drives of our wildlife 
safaris had us aching for the slow life. The "Who Has the Filthiest Feet?" 
contest amuses for only so long, so we traded in our khakis and slipped into 
port at Dar es Salaam, Arabic for "Haven of Peace."  
</P>
<P>
 Though Dar es Salaam is the commercial center of Tanzania, and the embarkation 
point for the 22-mile ferry ride to Zanzibar, it's delightfully unspoiled. 
</P>
<P>
 The ferry itself was our first clue to the mystique of that spice island. We 
queued up at the waterfront in Dar with throngs of natives; women in long, 
black shrouds or vivid sarongs, men in caftans and gilded, white fezzes. 
Someone wedged a five-foot, woven cage of live birds between Drew and me. An 
old woman chanted a traveling prayer in rapid Swahili. She wrung her spidery, 
henna-adorned hands as she purred her mantra.  
</P>
<P>
 Dusk arrived with us as we pulled into the harbor at Zanzibar town, the main 
city on the 640-square-mile, coral island. The air was warm and thick with the 
fragrance of spice. Local "agents" approached, eager to find us hotels, 
restaurants and transport. I marveled at the rich shades of their mahogany 
skin. "This way, Mista!" "Welcome, Madame. Welcome!" (Madame being pronounced 
"Mud 'em.") Our man of choice, Mohammed, would prove himself dedicated, albeit 
unpredictable.  
</P>
<P>
 Having arrived on the late ferry, 4 1/2 hours of standing room only, we 
learned that there were no vacant rooms left in town. Reassuring us animatedly, 
Mohammed secured a van and driver, chauffeuring the nine of us to a lively 
seafood restaurant, the Fisherman, on Shangani Street. Despite the fact that 
the menu had nothing to do with what was available in the restaurant, it was an 
enviable feast. We stuffed ourselves greedily with fresh crustaceans, calamari 
and African beer, while Mohammed worked out the accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned with our van and we were off again, winding through dimly lit 
Zanzibar streets, too spent to ask where we were going. Finally, Mohammed 
pulled over to the edge of a deserted beach and announced that we would spend 
the night on Prison Island. 
</P>
<P>
 No one said a word as we unloaded our gear and slipped out onto the sand, just 
a few titters of nervous laughter. As adventure travelers, we had asked for 
this. Closer to the water, two boatmen held a sail-less dhow at the ready, the 
whites of their eyes glistening in their thin faces. They seemed agitated, as 
if by the thought they might lose the fares they had been promised for ferrying 
us to our destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Dhows are among the last sailing ships making regular runs on the world's 
seas, and they hold a particular significance in Zanzibar, and her sister 
island Pemba, as coral reefs surrounding both islands hinder the passage of 
cargo ships.  
</P>
<P>
 A deep breath, then another, and we handed off our bags and struggled aboard, 
each finding some dry perch amid the nets and bail buckets. The old motor 
rumbled to life and we slipped into the mist. Mohammed, gaunt in his gray, 
tattered caftan, waved us away, a Merlin of that East African sea.  
</P>
<P>
 About 500 yards from the shore of Prison Island, the dhow suddenly ran 
aground. While the boatmen and one of the women in our group hopped overboard 
and struggled to free it, one of our group began a stream of hysterical 
gibberish and another simply froze in her seat, silent and petrified. I handed 
over the bags, tied my sarong up around my knees and joined the others in the 
thigh-high water. The coral wasn't as sharp as I had feared, but there were 
plenty of slimy, cold plants and marine creatures to wade through. As I made my 
way with the others toward the lush island, I saw tiny bungalows lit by oil 
lamps and candles. 
</P>
<P>
 The boatmen vanished. We were prisoners, abandoned on Prison Island. Lights 
were on inside the hotel, but no one answered our knocking. I went around the 
side and shouted "Jambo!" the Swahili version of "Aloha," to the ramshackle 
cabin in back. Finally, two men hurried out to us, and we haggled out a rate 
for five double rooms. To our surprise, the men then started down a path into 
the dark jungle. "Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God," moaned Anne -- who was from 
England -- as we shuffled along the trail, gear in hand, frequently colliding 
with what seemed to be large, round boulders.  
</P>
<P>
 At last, we arrived at a row of small bungalows on the edge of the sand. Every 
star was out. The hotel men slipped away without a word. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the group went directly to bed, easing under their mosquito nets with 
relief. Drew and I opted for night tide-pooling instead. Prison Island, also 
known as Changuu Island, is really just a large, flat, coral hill, so that even 
at high tide the surrounding waters are quite shallow. The intertidal zone is a 
maze of pools, each revealing a unique, self-contained home for sea life -- 
like little neighborhoods, alive with creatures that scuffle around together. 
Multicolored clown fish abound in the warm waters, as well as sea anemones, sea 
urchins and corals. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, we set off to explore the island. It takes about half an 
hour to walk the 1 1/4-mile perimeter. Our first discovery was the identity of 
those boulders from the night before: Giant sea tortoises lay about the island, 
which is a sanctuary for wild peacocks as well. There were the abandoned 
prison, infirmary and guard stations, built in 1893, to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Zanzibar became an independent Arab state in the 1800s, governed by the Sultan 
of Oman, who developed Zanzibar town and the clove industry. The island also 
became the largest slaving entrepot on the east coast, with Arab traders 
bringing captured slaves from all over the East African mainland. Prison Island 
once detained slaves. Originally owned by an Arab trader, the prison later 
housed hardened criminals and served as a quarantine station. Today, it is a 
strangely beautiful ruin, tortoises sunning beyond its walls. Arab doorways, 
still standing, frame the occasional, lateen-sailed dhow sailing elegantly by.  
</P>
<P>
 A revolt by Africans in 1964 overthrew the Arab ruling class on Zanzibar, and 
later that year Tanganyika and Zanzibar joined, forming the new country of 
Tanzania. But even today, the Africans of Zanzibar remain vastly 
underprivileged compared to the colonial Arab and Indo-Pakistani immigrant 
communities on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon we left Prison Island for Zanzibar town, where Mohammed 
greeted us as promised. When told about our dhow running aground, his eyes 
rolled skyward as he exclaimed, "Praise be to Allah! The Great One has saved 
your lives!" We took that to mean that Mohammed and his cohorts felt that they 
were not to blame. Back at the minibus, we rushed off again, this time to 
separate hotels, men in one, women in another. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's accommodations were of the standard, somewhat primitive caliber 
found in Zanzibar town, but with the allure of a candy shop downstairs, and a 
friendly dwarf, Harry, who washed our clothes to within an inch of their lives. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Later, on our way to the night market, Zanzibar town was a labyrinth: dark 
alley to ancient Arab palace to lonely beach littered with parchment-colored 
dhows. Evenings here mean communing. The townspeople are out visiting, or 
basking on their own front steps, children racing through the corridors. We 
came upon a group of men, leaning their chairs back against the wall outside a 
tiny shop front, laughing and talking on into the wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The glow of hundreds of creamy white candles lured us to the Jamituri Gardens 
at the waterfront near the old "Arab" fort, a massive, crenelated structure 
built by the Portuguese. We tried smoked octopus, spicy vegetables, beef satay, 
curries and cassava. Sugar cane nectar, pressed from the stalk through an 
antique clothes wringer, is surprisingly light and fresh-tasting. Local 
musicians supply the entertainment. This luscious repast is overshadowed only 
by the people-watching -- the night market is a rendezvous for friends, a 
special family outing, a shadowy, romantic tryst for couples.  
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, we took a tour through the spice plantations in a cool, 
open-air van, our guides introducing us to hundreds of spices and fruits. We 
wandered among cherimoya, plumeria , litchi, and jasmine trees. Zanzibar was 
once the world's largest producer of cloves. The clove plantations sport 
ancient sorting machinery, mound after mound of fresh harvest drying in the sun 
and balmy breezes. We continued on to the Marahubi Palace, once the home of the 
Sultans of Oman and their harems. The palace is a maze of ruined chambers, 
baths and outdoor "pleasure ponds," which prompted visions of decadence.  
</P>
<P>
 Thick jungle scenery punctuated the morning. Women sauntered slowly down the 
dirt roads, huge baskets of fruit and spice wrapped onto their heads with the 
same wild fabrics used for their sarongs. I spied a woman enjoying the shade of 
her lanai. She rocked her dozing baby in a hand-tied sling beneath a frangipani 
tree. With a slow smile, she let me take her photo, but covered her angelic 
child as I moved closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrangements were made (Mohammed again) to move on to Zanzibar's stunning east 
coast. We would stay at an all-but-deserted beach, near a tiny village. Our 
bungalows at the Bwejuu Dere Guest House were tranquil, to say the least, with 
their whitest-white adobe walls and doorways of periwinkle, yellow, pink and 
coral. The bedrooms were simply furnished with bamboo-and-palm-leaf beds laden 
with cotton mattresses and crowned with the familiar mist of mosquito nets. 
</P>
<P>
 I wondered why the proprietor was moving so slowly when we arrived. But our 
own pace became as timeless as we slipped into swimsuits and crossed the 15 
feet to the beach, pausing only to utter "lobster," our dinner request. 
Finally, we lay down in the sand, warm water licking our toes. Occasionally, a 
villager ambled by to offer a fresh-cut coconut or a sarongful of shells no 
more beautiful than the ones all around us.  
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, I walked off alone to explore the village, wearing a swimsuit 
and sandals. Among the huts were small gatherings of women of varying ages, 
reclining on palm-shaded lanais. They were amicable, despite our language 
barrier, yet I could see that they were shocked at my bare legs. 
</P>
<P>
 At their invitation, I stopped to sit with one group, and struggled to 
communicate with my bare-bones Swahili. Chattering faintly, an old woman made 
her way over to me, untied one of two sarongs she wore, and wrapped it around 
my hips. The other women cooed their approval; with that, I knew I had been 
initiated. Each woman summoned her own children so that I could take their 
photos, and we prattled on through the afternoon, shelling coconuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailing away from Zanzibar a few days later was downright mournful. What was 
it that called us to that spice island? The architecture, the culture, the 
beaches? The rich traditions that prevail here are protected by the blessing of 
the island's geographic elusiveness. Zanzibar remains a seductive capsule of 
time that spans centuries and surpasses expectation. Praise be to Allah.

 Getting there: To Dar es Salaam, British Airways flies via London; Swissair 
through Zurich, Air France through Paris. Round-trip fares start at about 
$3,420; Air Tanzania has flights daily except Monday and Friday from Dar es 
Salaam to Zanzibar for about $86 round trip. Kenya Airways leaves from Nairobi 
for Zanzibar on Mondays, Wednesdays and Sundays for $220 round trip. Tours: 
SafariCentre (3201 N. Sepulveda Blvd., Manhattan Beach, Calif. 90266; tel. 
800-624-5342) and United Touring Co. (1 Bala Plaza, Suite 414, Bala Cynwyd, 
Pa., 19004; tel. 800-223-6486) are two tour companies that go to Zanzibar as a 
side trip from safari tours. Alternately, there are several overland 
expeditions that make the stop; the best, in my estimation, is Dragoman (Camp 
Green, Kenton, Debenham, Suffolk, IP14 6LA, England; tel. 011-44-728-861133). 
Dragoman's U.S. rep is Adventure Center Travel (1311 63rd St., Suite 200, 
Emeryville, Calif. 94608; tel. 800-227-8747). For a longer stint than by other 
methods. Dragoman's five-week "Africa East & South" trip winds through five 
countries from Nairobi, Kenya, to Harare, Zimbabwe, or vice versa. Rates for 
the journey range $1,570-$1,900, depending on the season and include all land 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Prerequisites: You must have a yellow fever vaccination to enter Zanzibar; 
antimalaria measures should be taken as well. Some authorities recommend 
tetanus, typhoid, gamma globulin and cholera vaccines. A Tanzanian visa is 
required and is easiest to procure from the Tanzanian Consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: High-end lodging in town includes the centrally located 
Emerson's House (1563 Mkunazini St., Zanzibar; tel. 011-255-54-32153), a 
renovated old mansion with a variety of eclectic rooms and rooftop dining with 
great views of the city; rates $40-$95 with kitchen. Less expensive is the 
popular Spice Inn (P.O. Box 1029, Zanzibar; tel. 011-255-54-30728), a 
refurbished spice factory in the center of town. Rooms are basic, spacious and 
clean; doubles start at $22. For budget travelers, the Malindi Guest House 
(Malindi Street at Funguni Bazaar; tel. 011-255-54-30165) is a good choice. 
Breakfast is complimentary with $6 and $7 rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: Great restaurants in Zanzibar town include the Spice Inn, near 
the market, and Camlurs Restaurant, opposite the Africa Hotel.  
</P>
<P>
 When to go: June through October is the best time to visit, when the weather 
stays relatively cool, bright and rainless. Year-round temperatures range 70-90 
degrees and the trade wind breeze is ever-present. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information: Visit or call the Zanzibar Tourist Corp., on Creek Road 
between Parajani Street and Livingstone House on Malawi Road; tel. 
011-255-54-32344. Or contact the Tanzania Mission to the United Nations, 205 E.

OFFBEAT AFRICA; UGANDA; BY LAUNCH TO MURCHISON FALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA W. CARLSON, Carlson is a free-lance writer based in Branford, Conn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are three of us, the sole passengers on a creaky 28-seat launch chugging 
up the Nile to the foot of Murchison Falls. It's late afternoon, and a light 
rain is falling intermittently, making circles on the smooth surface of the 
river. The water is the color of milky tea. 
</P>
<P>
 We lean out over the railing of the boat, trying to get a closer look at the 
hippopotamuses wallowing in the shallows along the river edge. They are 
submerged except for their pink ears and eyes and a patch of oily-smooth black 
back. Suddenly one of them, with a great whoosh and flapping of ears and a 
snort and a geyser of spray, rolls up and out of the water, yawns and submerges 
again. And then another. There are hundreds of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Two uniformed park rangers carrying assault rifles -- leftovers from Uganda's 
civil wars -- take turns piloting the launch. One of them, a young woman, 
smiles and points out a crocodile. We don't see it at first, camouflaged in the 
grass. Then we spot it: a huge brown and black and silver monster with a 
yellowish belly, a crenulated back and a sinister jaw. It is lying motionless 
on the bank. We will see more than a dozen crocodiles no more than 20 feet away 
from us before this afternoon is over. 
</P>
<P>
 I am spending a month in Uganda, at this point watching the astonishing drama 
of Murchison Falls National Park unfold. It is like a play, with subtly 
suggested dangers along the river, the excitement of the falls and the serenity 
of the grassy giraffe-dotted hills. With me to marvel at this performance for a 
weekend are a vacationing Englishman and a friend of mine who teaches in 
Uganda. She has joined me for a couple of weeks during November, and we are 
spending our days visiting villages where her friends treat us to lavish 
luncheons in mud-walled huts (we eat with our fingers, sans forks and knives), 
as well as jouncing around in her pickup truck on Uganda's ubiquitous rutted 
red-dirt roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Today we have arrived at Murchison Falls, about 160 miles north of the city of 
Jinja, where the Nile (in this area called the Victoria Nile) spills from Lake 
Victoria. We are the only sightseers on the river, and apparently the only 
visitors in the park, and we're having a pleasant two hours meandering through 
the waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Murchison Falls National Park is the oldest established park in Uganda. It was 
registered as a national park in 1952, during colonial days as a British 
protectorate, and became East Africa's most visited park. In those days, the 
capstone of an African safari was Uganda, the lush green land Winston Churchill 
had earlier called the "pearl of Africa." And this park was a mecca for 
glorious game watching and hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 After Idi Amin seized power in 1971 and began a campaign of torture and 
persecution, tourists deserted Uganda and flocked instead to Kenya. For more 
than two decades after the coup, Uganda was racked with savagery and war. 
Hundreds of thousands were brutally murdered under Amin, who was toppled in 
1979, and under his equally cruel successor, Milton Obote. In those dark years, 
the country's economy collapsed, the parks teeming with wildlife became 
poaching grounds and tourist lodges were looted and burned. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, the country has turned around. The current president, Yoweri 
Museveni, has led the government since early 1986 and despite sporadic rebel 
and bandit activity and serious problems along its border with Sudan -- which 
is embroiled in a vicious civil war -- Uganda seems to have achieved a kind of 
stability it hasn't known for years. The infrastructure is still shaky and 
poverty remains widespread, but the people we met all over were friendly and 
warmly polite. 
</P>
<P>
 The national language of Uganda is English, taught in the schools, and most 
people in the cities speak English, with a lilting British-cum-tribal-language 
accent. Away from the cities, English is less frequently used. 
</P>
<P>
 But smiles go a long way, and part of the pleasure of visiting Uganda is 
stopping in villages where tiny tin-roofed shops advertise wedding gowns or 
bicycles, buying grilled bananas and oranges at roadside markets, sipping a 
fermented banana drink in a small bar, smiling back at a tiny bare-bottomed 
child outside a thatch-roofed mud hut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uganda is no longer an international pariah," Museveni said with brave pride 
a few years ago, and now the statement is truer than it was then. With civil 
wars blazing like forest fires in so many African countries, Uganda is viewed 
by State Department observers as one of the more politically stable countries 
on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 British Airways resumed flights to the airport at Entebbe in spring, 1993, 
after a lapse of almost two decades. European businesses and Abercrombie & 
Kent, the Chicago-based travel company known for its safaris, are investing 
millions of dollars in hotels and lodges. A&K last year completed permanent 
tented camps in Murchison and in the Buhoma Valley, near Bwindi National Park. 
Between 80,000 and 90,000 foreign tourists visit Uganda annually; early this 
year, Museveni's government abolished visa requirements for most countries, 
including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, efforts are being made to prevent tourist numbers from ballooning too 
quickly and overwhelming the infrastructure. Ben Otto, permanent secretary for 
the Ugandan Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities, says the plan is 
that "there shall never be mass tourism like Kenya's. We're developing a 
different kind of tourism: eco-tourism. Not many other countries offer 
primates; we have the largest number of mountain gorillas in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 gorillas live in Bwindi National Park, a wild and remote area in the 
southwestern corner of Uganda. Two families of gorillas have been habituated to 
humans, and only six trackers a day per gorilla family are allowed permits, so 
there are no tourist crowds. Tracking can be arduous -- sometimes for six hours 
at a stretch, through three valleys, along muddy, root-tangled paths. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kibale Forest, northeast of Queen Elizabeth National Park, I sloshed along 
a muddy but fairly easy path and heard the strange calls of monkeys and watched 
them, tails coiled above their backs, as they swung in the canopy, 200 feet 
above me. Kibale is a cool, green cathedral of a rain forest said to contain 
300 species of birds, 114 species of butterflies and 11 species of primates. 
</P>
<P>
 Uganda has an extraordinarily varied geography -- rain forests, savanna, snowy 
mountains that slice through the Equator, hot springs, lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The wildlife that was depleted is slowly coming back. (It's heartbreaking, 
though, to imagine what once was: The rhinoceros, once abundant, has 
disappeared, and the elephant population, about 18,000 in 1973, bottomed out at 
1,000 in 1987.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bird life here is unsurpassed, since Uganda is a home to the birds and animals 
of both East and West Africa. I remember particularly the flocks of white 
pelicans on Kazinga Channel in Queen Elizabeth National Park (also called 
Ruwenzori National Park). I also recall delicate cattle egrets perched on burly 
black buffalo to feed on bugs, and the perfectly named red-cheeked cordon bleu 
bird, a puff of blue and red splashing in a puddle. 
</P>
<P>
 There were certain places that simply took my breath away. I could only think 
of Shangri-La when we drove around the hairpin turns through the mountains 
north of Queen Elizabeth park, past mountain sides farmed (not terraced, just 
farmed; I wondered how the farmers could even stand on such steep slopes) 
almost to the summit, and looking down on the green expanses of the western 
segment of the Great Rift Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At Murchison, while the variety of animals and especially birds is wonderful, 
the centerpiece is the falls. Here the Nile pounds over great black rocks, and 
all the force and power of the river is squeezed into a cleft in the rocks only 
20 feet wide. The river doesn't simply tumble over the cliff edge, it explodes 
thunderously through the gap and down a 130-foot drop, and the spray rises from 
this cascade far above the cleft, clouding everything like wet smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first look at the falls was from below, from the launch. At a distance, 
the cascade is a white, ruffled ribbon above a river dotted with patches of 
white froth that look like ice floes, its thunder a muffled roar. The pilot 
wedged our 30-foot boat into a chink in some rocks in mid-river, and there, 
feeling a little corny, my fellow passengers and I clambered out onto a rock, 
took pictures of each other with the falls behind us, and mused briefly on how 
the early explorers must have felt when they came on this sudden violent 
interruption in the Nile's wanderings. 
</P>
<P>
 Murchison Falls (also known as Kabalega Falls) have been called the most 
exciting thing that happens to the Nile in its 4,000-mile journey from Lake 
Victoria to the Mediterranean. It was more than exciting to British explorer 
Sir Samuel Baker. In 1864, he and his young Hungarian wife, Florence, were the 
first Europeans to see the falls, and as they contemplated the experience, a 
biography indicates, a hippopotamus bull charged their boat and lifted it half 
out of the river. The Bakers continued onward and named the falls for the then 
president of the Royal Geographical Society: Sir Roderick Murchison. 
</P>
<P>
 For us, there were no charging hippos, and as day was dimming we drifted back 
on the river, which was serenely quiet even though the current was strong. The 
river had a metallic sheen; the sun dropped quickly, as it does near the 
Equator, suffusing the sky with orange, the water reflecting the sky's glow. 
</P>
<P>
 In this quiet copper twilight, I watched as fishermen paddled their wooden 
dugouts -- the same kind of dugouts that were used a century ago -- alongside 
our launch, and the rangers took on board a big Nile perch that they would cook 
later, back at their barracks. We moved from one side to the other on the 
launch, looking toward the shore at cliffs and trees and scrub and then along 
the river edge where the hippos' pink ears popped up from the murky water. Out 
in the middle of the river were small drifting islands of hyacinths or lilies 
where we saw wonderful birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterbuck had come to the river edge to feed, and they stood in a glade, 
beautiful to see. We spotted buffalo at a distance. If you're lucky, we were 
told, we might see elephant and even lion (although we didn't on this 
occasion). 
</P>
<P>
 When we returned to the launch dock, we saw fishermen coming in with their 
catch and women filling plastic jerrycans or earthen jars with water, which 
they hoisted to their heads for carrying up a steep dirt road to their homes. 
The women came in the morning and the evening to fetch water, and in their 
bright long skirts, often with babies swaddled in a shawl on their backs, they 
seemed like figures from illustrations of Biblical times. 
</P>
<P>
 Our lodgings in Murchison Falls park were in a rest camp of mud huts half a 
mile uphill from the Nile. The huts were just like the round thatch-roofed 
structures where villagers live; the floors were of mud and dung pounded 
smooth; the windows small apertures letting in little light. Toilet and bathing 
facilities were a pit latrine in a thatched shelter about 20 feet from our hut 
and a basin of hot water heated over a fire and brought to a lean-to by a camp 
attendant. But the beds were comfortable, and we would sleep deeply in them, 
after first spraying with insecticide to discourage lurking pests and fastening 
mosquito nets around us. (Most tour groups are lodged in somewhat more 
luxurious tented camps but since my friend and I were traveling independently, 
that option wasn't open to us.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening before slumber, we sat by a fire -- a bright circle of light in 
the deep dark of an African night -- and listened to then park warden, John 
Otekat, spin tales. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of our camp's proximity to the Nile, hippos sometimes wandered up at 
night to snort and chomp on grass; a hippo eats 150 pounds of grass a night. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, soon after daybreak, we went on a game drive, bouncing in a 
pickup truck over rutted dirt roads that wound through plains of tall golden 
grass and spiky thorn trees. We saw elephants munching and giraffes loping 
across the hills and various antelopes -- shaggy waterbuck and red-gold Uganda 
kob and hartebeest with their ridged horns. It looked like an unspoiled world, 
the beginning of time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, we traveled to the top of the falls and listened to the 
thunder. I climbed up a rock at the edge of the river, just above the falls, 
feeling the fine spray, feeling the roar and power of the avalanche of water. I 
gazed at the swirling, boiling water just before it plunges over the cliff, 
hypnotized by it, and then looked down the chasm to see the pool that spread 
out below the falls before rearranging itself into a stolid river again. 
</P>
<P>
 We stayed another night in the park, taking a walk to the riverbanks to look 
at the marabou storks perched in the treetops like gloomy hunchbacked sentries 
and later enjoyed an evening meal of chicken and rice, and savored the evening 
fire. Then, too soon, we left Murchison. We drove away on a road cut through a 
forest, and as a pleasant farewell to the park, we met a family of baboons in 
the middle of the road -- just hanging around, the way baboons do in Uganda. 
GUIDEBOOK: Going to Uganda 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: From LAX fly British Airways to London, with connections to 
Entebbe. Or fly any airline to Brussels and change to Sabena, which flies to 
Entebbe. Round-trip fares start at about $2,892. Entebbe airport is on Lake 
Victoria about a 45-minute drive from the capital city of Kampala. 
</P>
<P>
 When to go: The dry season of December through March is the recommended time 
to see wildlife because the grass is shorter, making the animals easier to see. 
There are two peak periods of rain -- the long rains from March to May and the 
short rains from September to November. The showers of the short-rain season 
are short and sweet but can sometimes put a damper on picture taking. Uganda 
straddles the Equator, and the dry summer months are likely to be quite hot. 
But the altitude and the lakes and rivers moderate the equatorial heat, and 
Uganda is usually comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. State Department advice: Because of rebel and bandit activity and renewed 
fighting in the area along the Sudanese border, travel in the northern part of 
Uganda is considered extremely dangerous, although the central and southern 
regions are peaceful. Before traveling to Uganda, contact the State Department 
for an update, (202) 647-5225. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour operators: It's possible to arrange a safari on your own after arriving 
in Uganda, but easier (although somewhat costlier) to make arrangements in 
advance. Often in Uganda, tours are custom-tailored but tour operators also 
offer standard tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Abercrombie & Kent offers a six-day gorilla-tracking safari to the Bwindi 
National Park and a seven-day tour of Queen Elizabeth National Park, Kibale 
Forest and Murchison Falls. The gorilla tour includes two days of tracking in 
Bwindi, after a drive through Uganda's "Little Switzerland," an area of deep 
gorges and mountain valleys. Since Rwanda and Zaire are dangerous locations for 
tourists, Uganda is, at the moment, the only place for tracking mountain 
gorillas. The Queen Elizabeth tour concentrates on game drives and includes 
launch cruises on Kazinga Channel and on the Nile in Murchison. Land costs 
start at about $3,500 per person. Abercrombie & Kent, 1520 Kensington Road, Oak 
Brook, Ill. 60521; tel. (708) 954-2944 or (800) 323-7308; fax (708) 954-3324. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot Ice Ltd. in Kampala schedules a five-day gorilla safari to Bwindi, similar 
to the A&K tour, with two days of gorilla tracking. Among other offerings are 
the six-day "Highlights of Southwest Uganda" safari and shorter visits to 
Murchison, Queen Elizabeth or Budongo Forest. The "Highlights" tour takes in 
Kibale Forest with walks to look for primates there, game drives and launch 
rides in Queen Elizabeth and a bush walk in Lake Mburo National Park. The newly 
opened Budongo Forest, not far from Murchison, is home to habituated chimpanzee 
families, and visitors are split into small groups escorted by knowledgeable 
guides. Hot Ice safari prices are generally somewhat lower than A&K's. Address: 
P.O. Box 151, Kampala, Uganda; tel. 011-256-41-236777 or 011-256-41-245165;

TRAVEL INSIDER: BRAND-NAME FOOD COURTS SOON TO BE IN SESSION AT LAX; AIRPORT: 
WHOPPERS, BIG MACS, PIZZA-PIZZA ARE AMONG THE CANDIDATES TO FEED HUNGRY FLIERS. 
HIGH FOOD PRICES ARE A CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hungry fliers have for years been dismayed and restless over the price and 
quality of airport food in this country, and Los Angeles International Airport 
is no exception. So many of us were first encouraged and then made restless 
earlier this year, when LAX officials announced plans to bring in a new era of 
concessionaires and food, then delayed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the paperwork is flying, familiar brand names are in the air and the 
process is in motion at last. But prices are still a question. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 companies have submitted bids to the city Airport Commission, 
proposing new operations for 21 airport sites -- more will follow -- from 
modest snack stands to the elevated Theme Restaurant, the most recognizable 
structure at LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 LAX officials say some of these new food and beverage operations could be 
doing business by spring, 1995, and they could all be open by fall. They 
represent a prime business opportunity: LAX officials report that food and 
liquor sales at the airport grossed $51.9 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some clues to what travelers can expect in the new era: 
</P>
<P>
 * Familiar names in the proposals include The Coffee Beanery, Arby's, Wok & 
Roll, Fisherman's Grotto/China City, Dreyer's Ice Cream, Sushi Boy, Ben & 
Jerry's (ice cream), Haagen-Dazs (ice cream), Creative Croissants, Burger King, 
McDonald's, Baskin-Robbins, Panda Express, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Wolfgang 
Puck's (specialty pizzas), Little Caesar's (pizza) and California Pizza 
Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 * Of three bidders vying to take over the cryptically named Theme Restaurant 
(which currently offers California cuisine at dinner entree prices from $10.25 
to $18.95), two are proposing new outer space themes and new names (still 
secret, for now). One of the space-theme bidders (proposing "chicken, fish, 
chili, lasagna . . . menu will be updated to showcase emerging talent and 
trends") is CA One Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Delaware North of Buffalo, 
N.Y., the nationwide concession company that holds the contract for Yosemite 
National Park. The other bidders are Host International (essentially another 
name for current operators Host Marriott, who propose American cuisine and 
pizza) and Concessions International, an Atlanta-based national concession 
firm, in a joint venture with the owners of Dulan's Restaurant on Crenshaw 
Boulevard and Aunt Kizzy's Back Porch in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the Tom Bradley International Terminal mezzanine, which currently offers 
only a cafeteria and bar, planners envision a restaurant/bar opposite a food 
court including several different burger and fast-food operators. Because so 
many additions are being made in the Bradley terminal, officials don't expect 
those operations to open before next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the trend of upgrading airport concessions with name brands goes 
back several years. It reached Los Angeles in March, when LAX officials 
announced plans to end their 34-year-old exclusive agreement with Host Marriott 
and seek out bids from dozens of would-be concessionaires. Many travelers don't 
realize that Host Marriott, joined by a pair of partners, currently controls 
all the airport food and beverage concessions because the company has "branded 
concept agreements" to use the names of Dunkin Donuts, Burger King, Manchu Wok, 
Pizza Hut, TCBY (yogurt) and Starbuck's Coffee. All the hiring and firing, 
however, is done by Host Marriott, and all the operations report to one general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The original LAX plan to open up concessions called for a June 24 bid 
deadline, but sparse interest in the paperwork-intensive project led to a 
three-month delay. About a month ago, airport officials began interviewing and 
evaluating would-be concessionaires. (Airport officials have structured the 
offerings so that most concessionaires are bidding to operate more than one 
site within the airport; thus, the initial eight concessionaires will operate 
restaurant or snack operations at 21 sites.) 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as planned, said Judy Solchak, the airport chief of contract 
services, the airport commissioners will forward their recommendations to the 
City Council for final approval by December. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost-conscious travelers, however, may be more interested in what airport 
commissioners chose not to do in the course of signing these new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Consumer Reports Travel Letter noted in June that airports in Boston and 
San Francisco now require concessionaires to charge no more than "street 
prices" for convenience items. Airports in Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas-Fort 
Worth are adding such requirements as contracts are renewed, the Consumer 
Reports editors found, and Denver, Detroit, Las Vegas and Seattle airports 
limit concessionaires to a markup of 15% above street prices. John Wayne 
Airport in Orange County and Pittsburgh's airport, the editors found, have 
similar caps. 
</P>
<P>
 LAX had a chance to move in that direction. In an airport survey last year, 
local travelers named high airport prices as their top concern, and early this 
year, LAX staffers investigated the idea of capping food prices at 10% above 
going rates outside the airport. Instead, the idea died. The Airport 
Commissioners dropped it in March, saying that despite the limited nature of 
the airport market, they'd rather rely on open competition to set prices.

JUST THE FACTS; HOW TO PICK AN ECO-TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Green" tours are all the rage, but the level of environmental commitment 
varies from company to company. Here are some questions to ask to help evaluate 
a tour operator's dedication to the principles of eco-tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before departure, do travelers receive pertinent information, such as how to 
approach wildlife or explanations of local customs? 
</P>
<P>
 * How big are the tour groups? Does the company limit the group size? * Does 
the company use knowledgeable group leaders, such as local guides, naturalists 
or historians, and what is the ratio of tourists to guide? (A maximum of 20 to 
1 is considered desirable.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Does the group stay in locally owned lodges that fit the environment? 
</P>
<P>
 * Does the local tour operator follow procedures that respect the environment? 
For example, is low-impact transportation used whenever practical, say canoes 
instead of powerboats? 
</P>
<P>
 * Does the tour operator donate money or equipment to help the local 
environment? What conservation organizations does it belong to? 
</P>
<P>
 * Are travelers encouraged to contribute to local conservation efforts? 
</P>

WEEKEND ESCAPE: ZACA LAKE; A FIREPLACE, A VIEW OF THE WATER AND A LODGE WITH A 
CHEF. NOW, THAT'S A RETREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Miller writes for the Ventura County 
edition of The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was early afternoon that sunny fall day as my husband and I lounged at the 
edge of tiny Zaca Lake, with gathering clouds above and a rising breeze that 
sent the amber-colored aspens into a flutter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the baby monitor clipped to my pants and my 10-month-old son sleeping 
peacefully in his portable crib 200 feet away in our rented cabin, my husband 
and I reveled in the peace, he dabbling in water colors and I finishing a book, 
both looking up occasionally to watch the resident coots run across the water 
with staccato slaps against the surface. It was one of those moments so serene 
and complete that I will store it away to conjure up when needed.Our reverie in 
the sun that afternoon, it turned out, was only one of several memorable 
moments at the quaint and quirky lake resort, which feels less like a privately 
owned "island" in the Los Padres National Forest and more like a New England 
summer retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a spot we had long wanted to visit, one we had heard about from friends 
in Santa Barbara. The 320-acre private parcel surrounded by the national forest 
was homesteaded 85 years ago and was a favorite haunt of the Chumash long 
before that. Fed by mountain runoff and underground sources, Zaca is the only 
natural lake in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, on a weekend when it was still relatively hot in Los Angeles, we 
headed north for a three-day escape. Our trip began like most of our family 
outings: a late start, the trunk jammed full with a stroller, which we didn't 
need, a baby backpack, which we used a lot and the portable crib, which is 
essential for babies because the resort does not have cribs. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving from Ventura, and with a two-hour drive ahead of us (about 3 1/2 hours 
from Los Angeles), we headed north on the Ventura Freeway toward Santa Barbara. 
To reach Zaca Lake, and the wine country for that matter, one takes California 
154, San Marcos Pass turnoff, which is just past the La Cumbre exit in Santa 
Barbara. The highway, which cuts through the Santa Ynez Mountains and overlooks 
Lake Cachuma, offers one of the nicest vistas in Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 We arrived at the main building at the resort just as the afternoon light was 
beginning to fade. After we checked in, my son and I settled onto the stone 
patio at the lake's edge for a bit of rice cereal and carrots. It turned out 
not to be much more than a bit because Ko'o, a large white Samoyed-looking dog 
that is alleged to be part wolf, gently licked the dish clean after I 
inadvertently set it down for a moment. Russ, the helpful maintenance and 
little-of-everything resort employee from Maine, shooed the resident dog away 
and apologized.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the Human Potential Foundation at Zaca Lake, as the resort is officially 
known, $110 a night plus tax buys you remote; it buys you rustic charm; it even 
buys you romantic; it does not buy you luxury. (The weekend would now cost $121 
for the first night and $99 for the second, $20 less than it was a year ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 (The Human Potential Foundation was created by owner Gerald Kessler when he 
and his son, Craig, purchased the resort in the mid-1980s. The Kesslers intend 
eventually to make the resort as self-sufficient as possible, producing its own 
energy through solar or methane power and growing all the vegetables used at 
the restaurant.)  
</P>
<P>
 A quarter-mile around the lake, which measures only 18 acres, was our cabin 
for the weekend, No. 9. The log cabins, which were built in the '30s and '40s, 
were cozy little rooms, about 15 by 15 feet, with knotty-pine paneling, large 
stone fireplaces in the center and windows in the back with views of the trees 
and the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The queen-sized bed was firm enough and gave us a comfortable night's sleep. 
The bedclothes were plain, but adequate. Our room needed recarpeting, but the 
feeling overall is that of a sweet, cozy mountain cabin. (Many of the cabins, 
according to the resort clerk, have now been recarpeted.) The bathroom, which 
is the same in all cabins, we were told, was a huge tiled affair with a giant 
wall heater that warmed the entire cabin. The room also offered a large tiled 
Jacuzzi that doubled as a bath or shower. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also have been perfect for a romantic party of two, with champagne 
chilling in a bucket nearby. . . . Alas, maybe another trip. . . . The tub 
appeared to have been well scrubbed but needed a rinse before I was prepared to 
dip in. 
</P>
<P>
 The windows on the back of the cabin looked out to a small patio with a picnic 
table and the leaf-covered forest floor sloping to the lake just beyond. At an 
elevation of only 2,400 feet, the pines were mixed with oak, one outside our 
door so huge that its trunk would have taken four adults to encircle. That 
elevation also allows for chilly winter nights, but it always warms up to 
sweater weather during the daytime, we were told. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was quiet. With only 17 cabins at the resort, there was not a lot of 
traffic. In addition, it seemed most people who came to stay a day or two spent 
their time on foot, walking around the lake and exploring the hilly hiking 
trails.  
</P>
<P>
 That night, we had dinner at the lodge, sharing the large dining room with 
four or five other couples -- the most people we saw at one time the entire 
weekend. The dining room, which virtually slopes toward the water, is lined 
with windows for a lake view across the front. There's a stove in the center of 
the room for chilly winter nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The chef, a burly man from Sweden with an accent that reflected his sojourns 
around the world, came to our table to tell us what he could prepare for us 
that night. Nilas Henning offered me several vegetarian choices, as I had 
called ahead. The regular menu for that night offered a choice of grilled 
salmon steak in bearnaise sauce for $18.95 or honey chicken breast for $16.95.  
</P>
<P>
 My entree was a large plate of beautifully presented vegetables encircling a 
delicately seasoned, generous serving of stuffed tomato over a bed of wild 
rice. The vegetables, including baby carrots, squash and green beans, were 
properly cooked, nicely seasoned and quite tasty. My husband's salmon was fresh 
and delicious in its light sauce. It was served with sauteed string beans in a 
thyme sauce and spaghetti squash.  
</P>
<P>
 At night, subtle yellow lights illuminate the dirt road around the lake. We 
took the 20-minute walk in the evening breeze, returning to put the baby to 
bed. Although the weather wasn't cold, we lit a fire with the wood the resort 
provided -- they would bring more if we wanted it -- and enjoyed the rest of 
the evening and some more wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Next morning, to give my husband a few extra winks, I strapped on the backpack 
and the baby, and I walked over to the lodge, where Russ poured me a cup of 
coffee in the kitchen and the chef offered me a muffin. We returned for a 
crispy waffle breakfast once the whole family was up.  
</P>
<P>
 Next, it was back to our cabin for the baby's nap and the quiet afternoon at 
the water's edge. That afternoon, we returned to our favorite Santa Barbara 
County winery, Carey Cellars, owned by a member of the Firestone family. We 
like the wine and the small converted craftsman-style ranch house set on a 
slight hill. Afterward, we spread a blanket on the lawn, ate our picnic of 
sandwiches and pasta salad and decided to call our wine tasting to an early 
end.  
</P>
<P>
 Another good night's sleep and we headed out for a crisp fall hike in the 
woods under the changing leaves. We chose a relatively flat trail through the 
rolling hills. But another couple we met at the resort had taken a four-mile 
loop the day before up over the ridgeline, a trip they said offered beautiful 
views and a good challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 With one more breakfast back at the lodge and after lingering over coffee on 
the patio, we said our goodby to Chef Henning and his crew. It was Monday 
morning and we were starting to feel like part of the family. We left with a 
promise to return, possibly with friends for a group weekend, or possibly only 
with a party of two. Budget for Three

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: STAYING IN SHAPE BY THE BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last two years, a small but respectable crop of new or updated travel 
health books has hit the market. Each aims to help travelers return home in the 
same shape they left, or maybe better. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the newest offerings:  
</P>
<P>
 * "Health Information for International Travel" (U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1993, $7 from the 
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 
20402). 
</P>
<P>
 Updated annually, the CDC's guide is not jazzy reading, but it's brimming with 
good, accurate information. Besides including general recommendations for 
vaccinations, it gives specific advice about vaccinations during pregnancy or 
for the acutely ill. The 22 pages under "Health Hints for the Traveler" outline 
such risks as food- and drink-related ailments. They also cover cruise ship 
sanitation and what to watch for during the post-travel period. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Travelers' Health: How to Stay Healthy All Over the World" (Random House, 
1994, $18, 212-751-2600). 
</P>
<P>
 Edited by Dr. Richard Dawood, this revised edition is a comprehensive bible 
for travelers. Its 14 chapters include sections on diseases spread by food and 
drink (cholera, food poisoning, others), water-related problems, "contact" 
diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy, and information on air travel, sea 
travel, vaccination and other topics. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Passport's Health Guide for International Travelers" (Passport Books, NTC 
Publishing Group, 1994, $12.95, 800-323-4900). 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best organized of the bunch, this 170-page book discusses pre-trip 
preparation (vaccines, medical kits), the trip (jet lag, motion sickness) and a 
short chapter on the returning traveler (when to get medical attention). * "The 
Travel Health Clinic Pocket Guide to Healthy Travel" (Silvercat Publications, 
1994, $13.95, 619-299-6774). 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Dr. Lawrence Bryson, a San Francisco travel health physician, this 
guide is also organized by how to stay healthy before, during and after a trip. 
Throughout the text are tidbits of information such as how to remove a tick and 
how to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. It is well presented and 
well packaged, but the price seems steep for such a tiny paperback. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Staying Healthy in Asia, Africa, and Latin America" (Moon Publications, 
1993, $10.95, 800-345-5473). 
</P>
<P>
 Author Dirk Schroeder, well acquainted with the destinations he writes about, 
dispenses information for anyone headed to a developing country, whether for 
business or pleasure. He offers a pre-departure checklist, including 
information on malaria pills and the likelihood of needing blood transfusions 
in developing countries. Illustrations explain how to wrap bandages or stitch a 
wound. Maps illustrate countries where travelers should take precautions 
against yellow fever, hepatitis B, malaria and other ills. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Guide to Traveling Healthy" (Vacation Publications, 1994, $5.95, Vacation 
Publications, 1502 Augusta Drive, No. 415, Houston, Tex. 77057). 
</P>
<P>
 This 48-page, magazine-like guide is meant for those 50 and older, but much of 
the information applies to travelers of any age. The booklet covers 
preparation, jet lag and other travelers' banes, insurance questions and 
vaccination requirements. There are tips for traveling with children, traveling 
with disabilities and how to manage minor maladies on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Altitude Illness: Prevention and Treatment" (The Mountaineers, 1994, $6.95, 
206-223-6303). 
</P>
<P>
 This pocket guide is meant to help skiers, hikers or mountaineers. In nine 
short chapters, author Stephen Bezruchka, an emergency physician and veteran 
climber, helps readers learn the differences among acute mountain sickness 
(AMS), high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary edema 
(HAPE). 
</P>
<P>
 * "1994 International Travel Health Guide" (Travel Medicine, Inc., 1993, 
$17.95, 800-872-8633). 
</P>
<P>
 This year's guide is the fifth anniversary issue produced by Dr. Stuart Rose, 
an emergency medicine physician in Massachusetts. It's full of information that 
has caused travel experts to describe previous editions as one of the best 
travel health guides around. In addition to sections on trip preparation and 
jet lag, Rose offers tips for food and drink safety, avoiding travelers' 
diarrhea and malaria and protection from insect-borne diseases. He devotes a 
chapter each to emergency medical transport and travel insurance, business 
travel and travel during pregnancy.

TRAVEL ADVISORY; A NEED FOR CAUTION AFTER TEL AVIV BOMBING

 Middle East 
</P>
<P>
 Israel: A terrorist bomb blew apart a city bus in Tel Aviv Wednesday, 
scattering dead and injured over the street in an apparent suicide attack by 
Islamic militants. At press time Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that 
22 people had been killed and 48 injured. An anonymous caller to Israel Radio 
claimed responsibility for the bombing in the name of Hamas. The latest wave of 
violence began Oct. 9, when two Arabs with automatic weapons opened fire on a 
Jerusalem pedestrian mall crowded with shoppers and strollers, killing two 
people and wounding 13 before they were shot to death by police, Times 
correspondents reported. The militant Islamic group Hamas claimed 
responsibility for the midnight attack, which occurred in the downtown Nahalat 
Shiva neighborhood of West Jerusalem. Although Americans are not normally 
targeted, the State Department advises that frequent terrorist incidents in the 
occupied territories and in Israel itself pose a danger. Travelers are advised 
to avoid crowds and public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Asia 
</P>
<P>
 India: After infecting more than 1,000 people and leaving at least four dozen 
dead, India's first outbreak of plague in nearly three decades is apparently 
receding. Some nations that imposed a virtual air travel quarantine have begun 
resuming flights to India. The U.S. State Department urged Americans in 
infected regions to observe "normal hygienic practices," and advised that 
travelers leaving India should expect delays in stopover countries, including 
health screenings.  
</P>
<P>
 Europe 
</P>
<P>
 Germany: Although Germany has a low rate of violent crime and tourists are 
rarely threatened, travelers should be aware of the recent spate of right-wing 
hate crimes against various ethnic groups. A young African man, found stabbed 
and beaten on rail tracks near Berlin, said skinheads had thrown him from the 
train, according to the Reuters news service. Part of his injured left leg was 
later amputated. Two weeks later in Magdeburg, four African refugees were 
beaten and slashed by a group of skinheads, one armed with a broken beer 
bottle. In the third such neo-Nazi attack in a month, vandals defaced memorial 
exhibits at the former concentration camp of Sachsenhausen near Berlin.  
</P>
<P>
 Netherlands: The country's relatively drug-tolerant image, which attracts 
thousands of young tourists to Amsterdam and other cities every day, may be 
about to change, Reuters reports. The Dutch government announced that it is 
clamping down on coffeehouses, where the sale of "soft" drugs has been largely 
tolerated. Drugs are illegal in the Netherlands, but the public sale of 
marijuana and the possession of small amounts of hard drugs have generally not 
been prosecuted. Existing rules forbidding coffeehouses to advertise or sell 
drugs to minors will now be strictly enforced to prevent hard-drug dealing on 
the sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Italy: A 7-year-old boy from Bodega Bay, Calif., was shot to death by bandits 
in an attempted highway robbery as he and his family were driving in southern 
Italy's Calabria region. Times correspondent William D. Montalbano reports that 
the stretch of highway between Salerno and Reggio Calabria is notorious for 
such attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea: There are no plans to introduce caning, but a presidential 
spokesman quoted by Reuters said South Korea plans a Singapore-style stiffening 
of laws against public misconduct. Fines for violating smoking bans will be 
raised to $62, for illegal parking to $100.

DESTINATION: ZAMBIA; WHEN OUR WALKING SAFARI GUIDE YELLED 'RUN!' WE TOOK FLIGHT 
-- AWAY FROM THE CHARGING BUFFALO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

lecturer at Cal State Northridge.

<TEXT>
<P>
 We had lingered too long over coffee and our guide was pacing restlessly 
beneath the great spreading trees sheltering Luwi Camp, a temporary five-hut 
settlement in Zambia's South Luangwa National Park. By 6:15 a.m. the four of us 
had set out on our morning walking safari, having been awakened by the 
unmistakable, not-too-distant roar of a lion. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Ansell, 52, the Kapani Safari Lodge guide who directed our safari, was 
eager to track the lion. In traditional safari walking order, he took his place 
behind Kalikoko Mwale, the Zambian ranger who carried a .375 caliber Brno bolt 
action rifle, the only weapon among us. My wife, Carol, and I followed them 
across the Chimsekata Flats on our way to Nsolo, another bush camp about nine 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Our British travel agent had encouraged us to visit South Luangwa National 
Park in Africa's landlocked south-central country of Zambia if we wanted a 
walking safari, which is defined narrowly in Africa. It refers to walking from 
one camp to another, and it usually means sleeping in one or more bush camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Although walking safaris are offered in several countries, including Zimbabwe, 
Botswana and South Africa, we selected Zambia, which is not geographically 
spectacular except for its beautiful Victoria Falls, because we were told this 
is where the modern walking safari was invented. We also learned that Zambia, 
along with Zimbabwe, is among the few countries that allow walking safaris in 
national parks; other walks are primarily in private game parks that may not be 
as rich in animal variety. We choose a walking safari rather than the more 
traditional motor safaris of Kenya and Tanzania because we had already done 
those and were hoping for an experience that wasn't tourist saturated. 
</P>
<P>
 We knew we would see fewer animals than we had on motor safaris in three 
national parks in Tanzania, where we had seen the "big five": elephant, 
rhinoceros, lion, leopard and African buffalo. But we were looking forward to 
the exhilarating sense of danger that comes from being on foot in the bush -- 
minus the protection of a 4,000-pound Land Rover -- as well as the chance to be 
close to animals unaccustomed to humans. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tanzania's tourist-heavy Lake Manyara, Ngorongoro Crater and the Serengeti, 
the animals are habituated to humans in four-wheel drive vehicles and I thought 
actually appeared bored. Once, on the floor of Ngorongoro, we saw a half-dozing 
lion with a great, black mane inspire a traffic jam of tourist-filled Land 
Rovers, stopped and lined up to get a good look. 
</P>
<P>
 Zambia's modern walking safari originated in South Luangwa National Park under 
the guidance of Norman Carr, a noted conservationist who began as a park ranger 
before Northern Rhodesia became Zambia in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in his 80s and something of a legend, Carr remains active in Zambia 
conservation, although his role in running Kapani Safari Lodge, which he 
founded, is reduced. The lodge newsletter says he has "been put out to grass," 
although he remains active day to day. 
</P>
<P>
 In Luangwa, the animals are less familiar with man and keep their distance. We 
had to seek them out, always hoping to find a big predator in the next clump of 
six-foot-high elephant grass and, at the same time, anxious that we might. 
</P>
<P>
 We had been driven in a Toyota Land Cruiser from Kapani Lodge to Luwi Camp the 
day before in time for a late afternoon walk with Ansell and Mwale. In proper 
walking order, we explored the banks and the many tracks left in the dry, sandy 
bottoms of the Luwi River, a flowing stream only during the rainy season that 
had ended in May, more than a month before our June, 1993, visit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We visited a plant-choked lagoon left when the river changed its course, and 
freshened each year during the rainy season. From a high bank we watched 
perhaps a dozen hippos and listened to their loud grunts and bellows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hippos are the most dangerous animal in Africa. They kill more people than 
any other animal because people misjudge their temperament and how fast they 
can move. Never make the mistake of getting between a hippo and the water," 
Ansell said. 
</P>
<P>
 I made a mental note not to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 We watched a crocodile ease itself into the water from the far bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crocodiles are the second most dangerous animal in Africa," Ansell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another mental note: Don't get between a crocodile and anything. 
</P>
<P>
 We walked the mile or so back to Luwi Camp without incident. Mwale had told us 
he always keeps a cartridge in the chamber of his rifle; he carried it in his 
arms almost like a baby. He said he has only to click off the safety to fire.  
</P>
<P>
 "When the animal charges, he comes very hard, very fast," Mwale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another mental note: Position myself behind the rifle when anything charges, 
particularly crocodiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Supper at Luwi Camp that evening could well have been served in a good 
restaurant in Nairobi, Lusaka or Harare: appetizer, soup, an entree and 
dessert. While we dined, Ansell told us that his father, an authority on small 
mammals of Africa, had served years in the Northern Rhodesia Game Department. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long conversation over Zambian beer, Ansell put out a small portion of 
food at the edge of the Luwi Camp clearing as treat for a ratel (or honey 
badger) that he said often makes nocturnal visits. 
</P>
<P>
 An attendant was placing kerosene lamps on the concrete pads beside the door 
of each hut and, as we prepared to retire, Ansell mentioned that a leopard had 
gone inside an unoccupied hut a few nights before, and warned that hyenas 
sometimes come into camp at night. It was the kind of bedtime line that 
reminded us we were, indeed, in the African bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get up during the night to walk to the bathroom, look outside first 
for eyes shining in the light," he suggested.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither Carol nor I could envision a sufficiently urgent call to nature to 
tempt us out into the night, even though the bathroom had a flush toilet and 
was only about 30 paces away. We fell asleep to the frequent, soft, 
high-pitched, almost plaintive calls of the puku, a kind of antelope that was 
grazing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 July nights are chilly in the Luangwa River valley, but the sun warmed the 
winter morning almost as soon as it cleared the horizon. We already were in the 
bush, mostly elephant grass and mopani scrub. The land was dry. Ansell had 
given us the few unbreakable rules: Follow behind him, don't fall too far back 
and, sternly, "Always do what I say." 
</P>
<P>
 His remark reminded me of a line I had read in one of the dozen or so 
guidebooks and safari pamphlets we had read before leaving for Africa: 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't attempt this safari unless you can climb a tree." 
</P>
<P>
 Ansell dismissed the guidebook warning with, "I've never climbed a tree in my 
life." Just the same, as we walked I kept an eye open for climbable trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansell and Mwale almost immediately discovered fresh lion spoor. The paw 
prints covered a diameter of about five inches, and they were shortly joined by 
hyena tracks. Ansell and Mwale also picked up and picked at samples from almost 
every pile of dung we encountered. Elephant dung, lion dung, leopard dung, 
buffalo dung and the only dung I could easily recognize, hyena dung. Hyena dung 
is white because, with their exceptionally powerful jaws, hyenas eat so much 
bone. 
</P>
<P>
 The lion and hyena tracks led on for a mile or so. Ansell said there was a 
chance we would come to a lion on a kill, and the pace quickened. He had told 
us what the guidebooks also said: "Never run from a lion. Stand still." 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be very difficult to do," I reminded myself, and wondered, "What 
about the tree?" 
</P>
<P>
 The tracks left the trail and headed into the tall grass and scrub brush. 
Ansell and Mwale decided not to follow. Another party and guide were to meet us 
half-way between the Luwi and Nsolo camps, and we were running late for our 
rendezvous. We came across tracks of elephant, several kinds of hoofed animals 
and even a leopard. 
</P>
<P>
 In about two hours, after a few animal sightings, we met other walkers from 
Nsolo Camp waiting in the shade of a large mopani tree. Ansell and Mwale began 
the walk back to Luwi alone and we continued on with the other group. 
</P>
<P>
 As before, an armed Zambian ranger led the way. He wore thick glasses, is 
somewhere in his 60s or 70s (his official documents conflict) and is a 
legendary figure in Zambian game and park management. He goes by the nickname 
"Ricetime." 
</P>
<P>
 His name is actually Magaba Tembo, and his skill as a rifleman is credited 
with twice saving the life of Kenneth Kuanda when he was president of Zambia, 
once from a charging lion and once from an enraged elephant. In gratitude, 
Kuanda presented him with the .375 Remington rifle he still carries slung 
across his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the group was another Zambian, Alfred, who carried a slender spear he 
laughingly said was "mostly for show." He picked up the rear. A congenial 
Englishman, Andrew Parker, and his son, Nick, also made this leg of the walk 
with us. The safari was a 16th birthday present for Nick, who was born in 
Zambia.  
</P>
<P>
 Our guide for the second leg of the trip would be Craig Doria, 30, a South 
African who lived and worked in conservation in the Zululand area of northern 
Natal before coming to Zambia. Like Ansell, Doria is a senior staff member of 
Kapani Safari Lodge, which is just outside South Luangwa National Park and just 
off the well-traveled paved road to the town of Mfuwe and its airport.  
</P>
<P>
 Kapani Safari Lodge is a permanent, tile-roof-and-stucco compound, home base 
and parent of both Luwi and Nsolo camps. Kapani has eight double rooms with 
bathroom facilities in its four chalets, a dining-and-bar area, a swimming pool 
and library/video area in addition to administrative and work buildings. It 
sits on a bank overlooking a lagoon of the Luangwa River, where monkeys romp 
endlessly among the many trees in the compound. Kapani is about a two-hour game 
drive from Luwi Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 As we set out with Ricetime, Alfred and the Parkers, Doria repeated the 
instructions Ansell had given: Follow him, don't fall behind and obey 
instructions: 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important of which is, 'run.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Doria added: 
</P>
<P>
 "Never run from a lion. If you do anything, run at the lion." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," I said to myself, hoping that my incredulousness would not be 
apparent as we walked through more mopani scrub and elephant grass that 
sometimes grew eight feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 We crossed the deep sand of the meandering Luwi River bottom three times en 
route to Nsolo Camp, and once we followed the sand for half a mile or so. Doria 
pointed out parallel snake tracks; one was a gently undulating line about two 
inches wide, and the other, also undulating, was four or five inches wide. It 
was easy to envision the large snake pursuing the small. 
</P>
<P>
 We came upon impala and puku grazing, and we saw more lion, leopard, hippo and 
elephant tracks. We found places in the river bottom where elephants had dug 
two or three feet to find the water below.  
</P>
<P>
 We were back in the grasses and scrub, walking at a measured pace when Doria's 
hand flew up in a signal to stop. Ricetime stopped motionless, almost at 
attention, and both men were looking intently to our left. The rest of us 
froze.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kakuli," he said softly to us. Then, "Buffalo. Solitary males." 
</P>
<P>
 "Where?" we asked.. 
</P>
<P>
 At Doria's direction, we backed up a few steps to more clearly see two large 
buffalo grazing at the edge of a thicket. They seemed huge, about 40 yards away 
from us, half hidden in the light and shadows. We took photographs and, at 
Doria's signal, moved on our way as quietly as we could. I remembered that both 
Doria and Ansell had told me: African buffalo kill more people each year than 
lions.  
</P>
<P>
 We had walked for just a few seconds when Doria and Ricetime froze again, each 
whispering a few words. I could feel the tension. Doria suddenly turned and 
commanded:  
</P>
<P>
 "Run!" We did, about 10 or 20 steps, then stopped. Ricetime had not moved a 
step, but he was holding his rifle at ready. I saw the end of the cocking 
motion as he readied himself. Doria had stepped back and to one side, moving 
away from the line of fire. Alfred was gone. The rest of us now were strung out 
over a 20-foot line. 
</P>
<P>
 We waited tensely. The nearest big tree seemed a mile away, but it was 
probably 40 yards or so. The bulls charged. My line of sight was obscured by 
bushes but Carol could see the bulls coming, but not directly at us. Their 
charge was misdirected. In a minute, Doria relaxed. So did Ricetime, but he 
continued to hold his rifle at ready.  
</P>
<P>
 "How could you see them?" I whispered to Doria.  
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't," he said, "but I could hear them. They probably picked up our 
scent and were moving toward where we were a few steps back." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred returned. He had gone back a few yards into the bush to set a small 
grass fire to distract the buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in a normal voice as we regrouped, Doria said that buffalo in a herd 
are rarely dangerous unless actively threatened.  
</P>
<P>
 "The solitary males, kakuli, are always dangerous and will charge for no 
reason at all," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived at Nsolo Camp without further incident. We joined Janelle, Doria's 
wife and the manager of Nsolo Camp, for an expansive breakfast. We ate well, 
knowing that we would take a shorter hike with Doria and Ricetime later that 
day.  
</P>
<P>
 Following that drive, we sat in the dining area talking with the Dorias until 
late that night. 
</P>
<P>
 We heard how a pride of lions once walked into Nsolo Camp at night, apparently 
just to watch. The lions weren't discovered until late, when people almost 
blundered into them on the way to their huts. When later we were escorted to 
ours by flashlight, we felt somewhat like Scouts who had been told scary 
stories around a campfire.  
</P>
<P>
 Thoughts of our day's adventure tumbled through my mind as I fell asleep in 
the quiet of Nsolo, but I remember wishing that I could hear again the sweet, 
night calls of the puku. 
</P>
<P>
 I still do. GUIDEBOOK

HIKING: NORTHERN CALIFORNIA: CIRCLE OF LIFE AROUND SHASTA LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mention Mt. Shasta or Shasta-Trinity National Forest to experienced hikers and 
watch their excitement become almost palpable as they rave about the great 
mountain or the vast forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Mention Shasta Lake and these same hikers are likely to mutter: "Hike where?" 
</P>
<P>
 California's largest reservoir offers some intriguing shoreline trails that 
explore surprisingly remote terrain. My favorite Shasta Lake trek is Clikapudi 
Trail, the area's longest and best-constructed trail, which meanders along the 
Pit River arm of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-mile long Pit River arm has two parts: A wide lower arm, with lots of 
boating and camping, has fine Shasta vistas, and the remote upper arm, 
sometimes referred to as Shasta Lake's "outback." Rangers say the upper arm has 
the lake's best bird-watching -- osprey and eagle; the best wildlife-watching 
-- otter, deer and even bear, and the best bass fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the good fishing is the abundance of snags that provide habitat 
for the bass. The land along the once-wild Pit River was not cleared prior to 
the completion of Shasta Dam in 1944, when World War II took all the available 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The path circles an area once inhabited by the Wintu people. Clikapudi, the 
trail name, is believed to have originated from the Wintu word klukapuda , to 
kill, and thought to refer to one of the struggles that took place between 
these Native Americans and the miners, settlers and traders who arrived in 
large numbers in the 1850s. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake shore archeological sites in the area suggest the Wintu lived here for 
many generations. Clikapudi Trail, which winds through woods and meadows, is 
tranquil enough for hikers to imagine what life may have been like for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From Interstate 5, six miles north of Redding, take 
the Mountain Gate exit (main visitor center is here; stop for information, 
latest road and trail conditions) and head east, then south, four miles on 
Oregon Trail to its junction with Bear Mountain Road. Turn left and proceed six 
miles to Jones Valley Road and bear left again, following the signs two miles 
to road's end at Jones Valley Boat Launch. The trail begins just beyond the 
large entrance sign to the parking lot. The end is on the south side of the 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: The signed path briefly meanders through a stand of knob-cone pine 
before traveling through live oak and ponderosa pine, both less common to the 
Shasta area. 
</P>
<P>
 A mile out, the trail dips near the lake shore and hikers look down the long 
arm of the Pit River. After a half-a-mile meander along the river, the trail 
bends southwest along Clikapudi Bay. Another mile's travel over a brushy 
manzanita slope and among Douglas fir brings you to the little valley cut by 
Clikapudi Creek. Farther along, you'll pass two Wintu archeological sites (no 
tangible cultural artifacts for the lay person to see). 
</P>
<P>
 Along Clikapudi Creek, the path mingles with an unpaved road, then crosses 
Jones Valley Road and descends a short quarter-mile to a fork. The west (left) 
trail leads a mile to Jones Valley Campground, while your east (right-forking) 
trail travels 1 1/4-mile to the trail head. Clikapudi Trail Where: Shasta Lake, 
Northern California Distance: 7-mile loop with 200-foot elevation gain. 
Terrain: Pine-and fir-cloaked shoreline. Highlights: Best trail along 
California's biggest manmade lake. Degree of Difficulty: Easy For More

DANA PARSONS: A NIGHT OF DECEIT WITH DEBBIE AND NO-NOSE KASSOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a pathetic single incapable of meeting people through normal human 
endeavor, your eyes have probably wandered to the personals in the newspaper: 
</P>
<P>
 "BUSTY CHRISTIAN SEEKS ELFIN GENIUS TO MATCH WITS, TAKE WALKS" 
</P>
<P>
 While scouring them in Friday's paper, I again was tempted to jot down some 
numbers in case there might ever be a Saturday night when I actually tire of 
watching "The Commish." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlikely, however -- not while the memory is still fresh some 20 years later 
of the night I ventured out on Dial-a-Date. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a dark and stormy night, and the newspaper I worked for wanted to 
investigate a new dating service in town that had advertised in the classified 
section. The editors wanted to be sure the service wasn't taking nefarious 
advantage of unsuspecting saps who plucked down 30 bucks for an evening escort. 
</P>
<P>
 Casting about the newsroom for someone to play the role of unsuspecting sap, 
the embittered editors settled on yours truly. 
</P>
<P>
 I arrived at the Dial-a-Date office, which had a desk, four chairs, a phone 
book on the floor and nothing on the walls. A young woman welcomed me and 
handed me a questionnaire that allowed me to list my likes and dislikes, 
religious preferences (if any) and whether I had a criminal record. At the 
bottom was a proviso that I had answered all questions truthfully, which I 
signed with the name, "Dana Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman asked to see a driver's license, and I told her I left my wallet in 
the car. She said I could bring it next time. I think she blushed as I thanked 
her for trusting me. 
</P>
<P>
 My answers apparently formed a match with a woman named Debbie, who, I was 
told, would call me to line up the date. I asked what Debbie looked like and 
she said, "She has super-long brown hair." A few nights later, Debbie phoned 
and we agreed to meet that Friday night at a "cozy little bar" that she 
recommended on the south side of town. I asked Debbie how I would recognize 
her. She said she was 5 feet tall and would be wearing a brown coat. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day at the office, I reported back to my friends and mentioned the 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that bar," our police reporter said. "The bartender is a guy named 
No-Nose Kassoon." He told me to check our clip files, and I found a single 
article with the headline: "Bar Blasted by Shotgun." 
</P>
<P>
 That Friday night I arrived at the bar just before 8. Two guys were playing 
pool for Falstaffs and another man was seated at the bar -- one of my 
colleagues. Soon, a short woman with super-long brown hair walked in and took a 
seat at the opposite end of the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, my friend and I kept a straight face. Debbie was pleasant, not 
realizing she was under surveillance. She was good company, but I began lying 
almost immediately. I told her I was a graduate student with an eye toward 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 We left for a classy restaurant where within minutes I spotted a guy who 
played on my basketball team in a city recreation league. Knowing he would blow 
my cover, I waited until Debbie left for the restroom and then went to his 
table and swore him to silence. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner went uneventfully, and I was keeping excellent mental notes for the 
article I was going to write. Maintaining fraudulence was exciting; it was like 
being a spy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the restaurant provided some unexpected entertainment. Instead 
of the standard strolling violinist or hypnotist, the featured performer was a 
psychic. Debbie summoned him to our table. 
</P>
<P>
 She told him about the arranged date. He pondered us at some length and soon 
began seeing blues and yellows swirling around Debbie's head. He said he saw a 
junk drawer that needed to be cleaned. He predicted that we would hit it off 
well and said we should look beyond Dial-a-Date. "I think there's something 
between you, maybe more than you want to admit." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked if he envisioned me teaching and he said, "I wish you hadn't said 
that. I was just about to suggest teaching. I think you'd be perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't see through my disguise, and neither did Debbie. We ended the date 
at the appointed midnight hour with nothing more exciting than a peck on the 
cheek. It was not an affair to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a sequel, though. Although I didn't name her in the article I 
subsequently wrote, Debbie phoned and said her boyfriend somehow figured out it 
was her. He didn't know she was moonlighting for Dial-a-Date, and now they were 
breaking up because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, everything was a lie, I told her -- except the part about enjoying myself 
with her. That didn't soothe her, and I sense the paper lost a subscriber over 
that one. 
</P>
<P>
 I never answered a newspaper ad again. As for Debbie, I hope she's happily 
married somewhere, sitting home on Saturday nights watching television, having 
long ago forgiven the jerk who cost her a boyfriend.

BIKE COMMUTERS NEED ON-ROAD TRAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mayor of Laguna Beach, Ann Christoph, tries to use ambience, cost and 
safety as arguments against reconstructing Laguna Canyon Road with wide 
shoulders ("Laguna Canyon Bike Trail Best Option," Letters, Oct. 16). The 
Orange County Bicycle Coalition is opposed to the mayor's idea because it is 
not the best option. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambience? Wow! The mayor is saying that reconstructing with wide shoulders for 
cyclists will adversely affect the ambience created by cars with their noise, 
visual and air pollution. A remarkable argument indeed! 
</P>
<P>
 Cost? The fact is that reconstructing (Laguna Canyon Road) with wide shoulders 
will reduce its maintenance needs and extend its life. Thus, wide shoulders 
will actually reduce the total expenditure. The mayor advocates short-term 
savings and long-term expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety? John Forester, is an internationally recognized expert in the fields 
of bicycle safety, planning and facility design. Here is what Forester says 
about bike paths: " . . . by far the most dangerous facility is the bike path, 
with an accident rate of 2.6 times that of the average roadway." Clearly, Mayor 
Christoph, who makes the assertion that "bicyclists would have a safer . . . 
trip" on the off-road bike path, knows nothing about bike safety. 
</P>
<P>
 An experienced cyclist, commuting by bike, will rarely travel on a bike path. 
Paths are for recreational cyclists who want to have a pleasant experience away 
from motor vehicles. The best option is to reconstruct (Laguna Canyon Road) 
with wide shoulders for commuting cyclists and construct an off-road bike path 
for recreational cyclists. The (Orange County Bicycle Coalition) encourages the 
mayor and City Council to look at the facts, and choose the truly best option. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL R. MOTT 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman, O.C. Bicycle Coalition 
</P>
<P>
 * Regarding "Laguna Canyon Bike Trail Best Option," by Ann Christoph, mayor of 
Laguna Beach, Oct. 16: 
</P>
<P>
 As a cycling enthusiast, I ride over 4,000 miles per year on the roads of 
Orange County, including Laguna Canyon Road. While I appreciate Mayor Ann 
Christoph's support of "access for bicycles parallel to Laguna Canyon Road," I 
must take issue with her opposition to on-road bicycle lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 A parallel off-road bicycle trail would not reduce the amount of paving in the 
canyon, just change its location. In addition, for enthusiasts such as myself, 
on-road bicycle lanes are actually safer than off-road trails. Off-road trails 
are in reality multiuse recreational trails, used by runners, roller skaters, 
walkers, even people and their pets, in addition to cyclists. The large 
difference in speed of these activities creates some very unsafe conditions, 
forcing many cycling enthusiasts back onto the road. Therefore, an off-road 
trail would not be a "safer, more pleasant trip." 
</P>
<P>
 There are only two extended stretches of uninterrupted, undeveloped roadway 
suitable for cycling left in Orange County -- Laguna Canyon Road and Santiago 
Canyon Road. Eliminating bicycle lanes along Laguna Canyon Road is simply not 
acceptable.

CAPIZZI GETS A BAD RAP IN THE MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was absolutely astounded to see remarks attributed to me in a recent article 
criticizing the Orange County district attorney's office ("O.C.'s Capizzi Takes 
Hit from Busts-Gone-Bad," Oct. 9). 
</P>
<P>
 After 17 years as a criminal defense attorney, I am used to the occasional 
misquote or out-of-context statement. But in this story, absolutely every 
comment of mine was taken out of context and misquoted in the extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporter said he was doing a story on Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi's 
recent problems. He mentioned several cases in which Capizzi's office has come 
under scrutiny, and suggested that I could "tie it all together" by commenting 
on Capizzi's responsibilities for these developments. 
</P>
<P>
 I told the reporter I did not think these disparate matters could in fairness 
be tied together because they have no common thread. 
</P>
<P>
 You would never know from my quoted remarks that most of my comments were 
about why I disagreed that the D.A.'s office was at fault in the areas 
discussed and why I believed the media in general and The Times Orange County 
in particular were behaving irresponsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 I also told the reporter that another recent Times story examining the D.A.'s 
handling of domestic violence cases was "a hatchet job" and misused statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that in the last few years the American media, once the pride of the 
Western world, have abandoned their role as professional journalists and now 
report crime not as objective news but as cheap, lurid entertainment to sell 
newspapers and TV time. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime news is a feeding frenzy for the press, with citizens whipped up to feel 
that no matter where they live, they are in constant danger of being raped or 
murdered at any moment. Someone has to be blamed for all the crime, and one of 
the possible targets is the D.A. of each county. 
</P>
<P>
 "D.A. Doing Good Job" is not news and will not sell papers. Attacking the D.A. 
provides a villain and sells copy. It also feeds Americans' existing 
post-Watergate fears that all their public institutions are corrupt or 
disintegrating, and erodes their belief in government overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians have hopped aboard this train and hyped the crime issue at every 
opportunity in order to get votes, are in turn egged on by the media, and the 
cycle escalates. Few prosecutors can withstand this kind of pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 I was also quoted out of context and erroneously as saying, "I don't like Mike 
Capizzi and he is the opposite of everything I stand for. But I think he is 
being affected by forces greater than himself, just like every other D.A." 
</P>
<P>
 What I said was that I am no fan of Mr. Capizzi's policies, particularly the 
lack of discretion given to his deputies to tailor justice to the individual 
case. I am not accustomed to defending him because we are opposites in the 
court system and our politics are poles apart. But I think The Times is being 
unfair to him and to his office.

A NEW PRAGMATISM TOWARD SACRAMENTO; O.C. DELEGATION FINALLY OPPOSING LESS, 
DOING MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the exception of the 69th Assembly District, the Orange County 
legislative delegation in Sacramento is made up entirely of Republicans. In a 
heavily Republican county, there is little suspense in a number of these 
contests, and The Times chooses not to endorse in most of them. However, the 
fall campaign again provides occasion to take stock of Orange County's 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, this group of legislators too often has relished the moniker of 
"cavemen," opposing instead of doing. When we delivered a "report card" two 
years ago, we lamented the mediocrity. We praised state Sen. Marian Bergeson, 
but she is leaving her post in Sacramento for the Board of Supervisors.  
</P>
<P>
 While a special election for Bergeson's seat will have to wait until next 
year, there is some discernible shift in attitude in the delegation. It has 
shown itself to be a bit more willing to engage in the art of political 
negotiation and compromise. It seems to have recognized in part that there is 
more to life in Sacramento than saying "no." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most noteworthy change has been the political maturation of Curt 
Pringle of Garden Grove, who is being challenged in what is generally 
considered a "safe" 68th District for Republicans by Anaheim City Councilman 
Irv Pickler, a Democrat. Pringle is still extremely conservative, and will be 
remembered as the candidate of the GOP when the party had to pay damages to 
Latinos for posting poll guards outside polling places in his old district. But 
this time, representing a new 68th District after sitting out a term, Pringle 
began to show evidence of a more pragmatic style. As Assembly assistant 
minority leader, he is now in line to be minority leader and typifies a subtle 
shift toward a more engaged style of representation in the delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Doris Allen of Huntington Beach, challenged by Democrat Jonathan 
Woolf-Willis, works reasonably hard. In the past year, she focused on school 
safety to curb violence by establishing a 1,000-foot "gun-free zone" around 
campuses. She is said to have her eye on the Bergeson Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Another likely candidate in that future Senate race is incumbent Ross Johnson 
of Placentia in the 72nd Assembly District, which is a safe Republican seat. 
Johnson is being challenged by Democrat Allan Dollison. Johnson has been active 
on trying to revive Proposition 73, a successful state ballot measure to limit 
campaign contributions that was struck down by federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Bill Morrow of Oceanside, who represents some of South County, 
co-authored a bill that would invalidate bequests to attorneys who made 
themselves beneficiaries of client estates. He is still learning the ropes in 
Sacramento, running in a safe Republican district. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most controversial member of the delegation has been incumbent 
Mickey Conroy of Orange, in the 71st District. He was the author of the 
controversial paddle bill, which failed. He wanted to have volunteer poll 
watchers in another Assembly district, the 69th. He is challenged by Democrat 
Jeanne Costales in one of the most Republican districts, but faces his sternest 
test ahead in a lawsuit filed by a former aide in a sexual harassment case.  
</P>
<P>
 On the Senate side, the free-spending Rob Hurtt of Garden Grove has the money 
to spend to retain his seat in the 34th District, and got a lot of attention 
for testing tradition as a newcomer, but has not established much of a 
legislative record. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, the delegation is evidencing a new pragmatism that, even if short 
on legislative accomplishment, is some improvement on the negativism of the 
past.

GRANVILLE IS THE CHOICE FOR CLERK-RECORDER; UNLIKE HIS OPPONENT BRANCH, HE CAN 
CAPABLY LEAD THE CONSOLIDATED AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County taxpayers will reap financial benefits next month when they vote 
for clerk-recorder, but they have a chance for more. Combining what were two 
separate posts will save one salary. By voting for Gary L. Granville to handle 
the job, they can also help clean up a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 As county clerk, Granville did a good job supervising 300 employees who 
handled paperwork for the courts. It was on his recommendation that the Board 
of Supervisors combined his office with that of the recorder. That should save 
hundreds of thousands of dollars by trimming staff and eliminating duplication. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville realized that he would lose his job Dec. 31 when the merger becomes 
complete, but he went ahead, and later decided to run for the combined post. He 
deserves election. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponent, Lee A. Branch, has been a disaster as recorder. This year the 
supervisors took the unprecedented step of censuring him; since then the county 
administrative office has been forced to lend staffers to the office to help it 
operate. Putting Granville in charge will let the administrative office move 
its people back to other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville, a former businessman, was an able and energetic aide to a county 
supervisor. In 1985, after county judges complained about Branch's management 
of the combined office of clerk-recorder, the supervisors broke the office in 
two. They appointed Granville clerk and left Branch as recorder. Granville won 
two subsequent elections, improved morale in the office and oversaw its entry 
into the modern age of computers. He has been eager to improve service to the 
public, lawyers and judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch, meanwhile, was repeatedly denied raises by county supervisors trying 
to get him to do better. Yet one county report last January found him 
unresponsive and isolated. Another report, by the county's affirmative action 
officer, concluded that he should resign. His involvement with a woman who 
worked for him was blamed by recorder's office staff as a contributing factor 
to their poor morale. 
</P>
<P>
 In a four-person race in June, Granville finished first but just missed 
getting the 50% needed to avoid a runoff. He deserves election as 
clerk-recorder Nov. 8. It will be difficult correcting the problems of the 
recorder's office, but Granville has shown he is up to the job.

REACTION TO THE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST PRIEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a parent whose son attended Santa Margarita High School and am absolutely 
sick about the accusations leveled at Msgr. (Michael) Harris ("Molestation 
Allegations Dim Star of O.C. Priest," Oct. 16). 
</P>
<P>
 We moved from Manhattan Beach just to attend the new high school at Santa 
Margarita. When we moved the school was 2 years old. The principal was Msgr. 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was everything that we could have hoped for. My son thrived in the 
environment, which always seemed to come from a loving, caring place more like 
a family than a school. I often commented to my wife that I wished I could have 
attended a school like this. 
</P>
<P>
 I certainly don't know the answers to these accusations. My son said that in 
all the dealings that he and his friends have had with Msgr. Harris there was 
never anything which could have led him to believe that this could have 
happened. Msgr. Harris was always what he appeared to be, a priest who 
respected and loved those under his care. 
</P>
<P>
 I would hope that Msgr. Harris reads this letter and realizes that there are 
many grateful families who have been privileged to have had their child spend 
their formative years with him as their educational and spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * I am an alumnus of Santa Margarita High School, and now a student at 
Southern Methodist University in Dallas. I was 1992-93 student body president, 
and I was also president of my freshman, sophomore and junior class when I 
attended Santa Margarita High School. 
</P>
<P>
 I was recently informed about the allegations against Msgr. Harris, and my 
reason for writing this letter is to inform you about the great amount of time 
that I shared with Msgr. Harris and the way I perceived his character. 
</P>
<P>
 I want you and those who read this letter to know my point of view as a 
student and younger friend of the monsignor's. As I said before, I was 
president of my class for three years and student body president for one year, 
and during this time I spent a great deal of office time and personal time with 
Msgr. Harris.  
</P>
<P>
 I also spent a great deal of time with Msgr. Harris outside school. I spent 
time at the monsignor's home, in the chapel, and on vacations with him. I got 
to know Msgr. Harris very well over the last five years, and I know what he is 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Harris' credibility is going to drop a great deal because of these 
charges, but we must fight to keep that credibility strong. I know Msgr. Harris 
well, and I know these charges are not valid. 
</P>
<P>
 People will look at the monsignor in a completely different manner, at least 
those who don't know him like I do, and they will think of the allegations 
rather than all the marvelous things he has done in his life.  
</P>
<P>
 He is a wonderful man that has done so much for the community, we must make 
sure the community remembers these great gifts, and not the charges that are 
probably brought about by resentment for something not even pertaining to Msgr. 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 I pray that with the efforts of his friends, this issue can be resolved soon.

 * I am not even going to address the charges filed against Father Harris 
because your paper is not responsible for those, but you are responsible for 
allowing your reporter to write a sensationalized and totally irresponsible 
piece of journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 (You) never mentioned once in the article that it was a tradition for Father 
Harris to have students over to his house on weekend nights to show films, eat 
popcorn and ice cream, and drink soda. My four sons and their friends have been 
there numerous times. You made it sound as if this boy and his friends were the 
only ones that went over there. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Mater Dei students and Santa Margarita students attended these evenings 
and loved going over there. 
</P>
<P>
 You quoted the boy as saying Father Harris made him feel special. Father 
Harris made everyone feel special -- that was his gift. He is a very 
demonstrative person; he hugs men and women and students alike. That is part of 
his dynamic personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Your reporter quoted a letter that he wrote supposedly apologizing for what he 
did to this boy. Are your readers going to notice that you left out quite a bit 
of the middle of that letter, that he was probably saying he was sorry for the 
death of her son? It sure looks as if (you) chose to print the parts that 
implied guilt. There were other inflammatory words used -- wet bar (why?). I am 
very disappointed in the way this story was handled and I trust you will spend 
more time interviewing the people who know him, love him, respect him, admire 
him, and acknowledge that he has given so much to our children, our church and 
to Orange County.

 * I beg the supporters of Father Harris to think of the victims who will never 
recover from their experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again I read about a wonderful priest, this time Father Harris, and I am 
forced to relive the terror of my childhood as a victim of a priest who was 
everyone's friend. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no doubts that Father Harris has many fine qualities. I also believe 
that the victims of sexual abuse have many fine qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 My abuse, which took place over a seven-year period, was accidentally 
uncovered and the priest was sent away in the dark of night. 
</P>
<P>
 I was told that to make this molestation public would be bad for the church 
and the people who had come to depend on the priest for their spiritual 
guidance. The priest that molested me was also in charge of the altar boys, the 
choir, the Boy Scouts, and participated in many parish activities.

KEMP DESERVES CREDIT FOR HIS COURAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the article on Jack Kemp voicing his opposition to Proposition 187 (Oct. 
20), Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) was quoted as saying Kemp 
"should have kept his mouth shut." 
</P>
<P>
 Who does Rohrabacher think he is? Mr. Kemp accurately points out the 
proposition won't work and that its only value is as a statement to the federal 
government to do something.While I agree with Kemp, Rohrabacher's comment is 
just plain stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp should be lauded for his "guts" in speaking his mind, not toeing the 
party line (if indeed it is the party line). Staying "quiet" panders to the 
lack of information most of the public has on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Such conduct gives us two things: (1) representatives who don't serve our 
interests by having issues explored by intelligent dialogue through the 
exchange of differing opinions; and (2) continues our election of 
representatives who just say whatever it takes to get elected. Obviously this 
is the way Mr. Rohrabacher conducts himself. 
</P>
<P>
 To think that if a differing opinion by any Republican once voiced will keep 
one or more Republicans from being elected is infantile. Playing the "game of 
politics" has gone on long enough. All this game has done is make our system 
unable to accomplish anything, beyond employing the likes of Rohrabacher, and 
provides government to the lowest common denominator. I, for one, feel we 
deserve more, such as what Jack Kemp provides, intelligent dialogue.

A FITTING MEMORIAL IN SAN CLEMENTE; TEEN'S KILLING HAS ENERGIZED RESIDENTS TO 
FIGHT CRIME, IGNORANCE, MISUNDERSTANDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the time of the attack that left teen-ager Steve Woods in a coma until 
his death nearly a month later, the quiet seaside community of San Clemente 
fought through its shock to recognize problems and start solving them. There 
have been many commendable efforts toward that end, and their continuance is an 
appropriate response to a senseless death. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 17, was speared in the head with a paint roller rod last year while 
riding in a car with friends, leaving a beach after a Friday night party. 
Police blamed the attack on Latino gang members, but relatives of the accused 
contended Woods' friends had started the fracas by taunting the Latinos. Two 
months ago, two teen-agers were convicted of second-degree murder in the 
attack. A third man pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. Other cases are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods' death and the arrests prompted some wrongheaded denunciations of 
Latinos in general. Sheriff's Lt. Tom Davis, San Clemente's chief of police 
services, properly denounced those sentiments while also pointing out that 
gangs were indeed a problem, no matter what their members' ethnic backgrounds. 
Davis put a four-person anti-gang unit on the streets, targeted the top 20 
youthful offenders in San Clemente and followed them through the criminal 
justice system. Residents took such steps to improve their community as the 
formation of Neighborhood Watch programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Clemente High School, Principal Christopher Cairns and teachers 
developed programs to assist minority students and explain differing cultures 
to all the pupils. The city's Task Force for Youth signed up people for a new 
tutor and mentor program. Those can be valuable tools in showing students that 
education can help them attain a better future; the absence of that hope is 
often a motivator for gang membership and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides public meetings on gangs, there were also public forums on what 
Latinos perceive as racism in San Clemente. Airing those concerns is healthy; 
all segments of the community should understand the concerns of others. Whites 
are still the majority in San Clemente, but the 1990 U.S. Census found that the 
Latino population had doubled to about 13% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods' killing shattered the image of San Clemente as a peaceful suburban 
paradise. But it energized many residents as well to fight crime and help 
others. Maintaining those good programs would be a fitting memorial to a 
teen-ager who died tragically.

INTRODUCING THE CHUTZPAH AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I suggest that The Times institute a Chutzpah Award to be given on a regular 
basis to that public figure who makes the most egregiously outrageous and 
illogical comment on a matter of public interest during the period under 
review. As initial recipients of this award I nominate these individuals: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dist. Atty.Michael R. Capizzi: After his office bungled the case of the 
supposed Laguna Canyon arsonist, he had the gall to attempt to shift the blame 
onto the media!  
</P>
<P>
 * The Rev. Lou Sheldon: He justified his support for Proposition 187 on the 
grounds that illegal immigrants are not mentioned in the Bible. What arrant 
nonsense! Did Jesus check the nationality of those upon whom He worked his 
miracles? Did the good Samaritan ask for a green card before he helped the 
wounded traveler?  
</P>
<P>
 From his past comments we know of Sheldon's virulent antipathy toward 
homosexuals and abortionists, and now he has added illegals to his verboten 
list.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON POLITICS; RECESSION, CRIME AND CLINTON ARE 
RECIPE FOR GOP VICTORIES; COUNTY VOTERS WILL PUT HUFFINGTON OVER TOP ALONG WITH 
WILSON AND LUNGREN. MEASURE A, JIM SILVA WILL ALSO WIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGH HEWITT, Hugh Hewitt is a Newport Beach attorney who co-hosts PBS 
affiliate KCET's weeknight news and public affairs program, Life & Times, and 
his own radio show on KFI-AM 610, Sunday nights at 9. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County electorate is in a sober mood. Two years of Bill Clinton in 
the White House coupled with wearying recession and the incursion of violent 
crime into even the most security - minded neighborhoods have combined to 
cement an attitude of seriousness. That undeniable resolve will produce some 
crucial results on the Wednesday after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Huffington beats Feinstein statewide, propelled by a huge margin from 
Orange County: Folks have figured out that California is not best represented 
by two hyper-liberals from San Francisco. Orange County knew that two years 
ago, but the rest of the state gambled on a Feinstein-Boxer-Clinton sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein will suffer the wrath of retirees and near-retirees 
throughout the county. When she voted to tax Social Security benefits, she cut 
the real income of folks who could least afford it. Perhaps she counted on the 
shock value of a Democrat breaking faith with a constituency that has long 
provided a buffer for liberals. The Leisure World buzz is angry, however, and 
mobilized. Even the longtime Democrats have to be shocked by Feinstein's breach 
of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Independents in the county note Feinstein's unfailing support of the Clinton 
agenda, right down to her 10 votes to halt Whitewater hearings in the Senate. 
Clinton has always been a losing proposition in this area, even on the night of 
his victory. Feinstein threw in with him. The county's independents will throw 
in with Mike Huffington as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the county's stronghold of Democratic votes -- a large Latino block and 
the voters on the factory floor -- are deserting. First, Feinstein threw her 
Latino supporters overboard in an attempt to demagogue the border issue. And 
the revelation of Feinstein's use of a taxpayer-provided chauffeur infuriates 
folks who work hard and simply cannot square such a taxpayer-provided luxury 
with Feinstein's net worth of $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Huffington has a message that has comforted the county's 
conservative bloc. Though he's a moderate on the social issues, Huffington's 
vigorous assault on the growth of the federal role, especially in the welfare 
system, has found an enthusiastic audience in a region overwhelmed by unfunded 
and intrusive federal demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Huffington carries the county by a quarter-million votes -- enough 
to overcome Feinstein's home base in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The Wilson-Lungren repeat: State Democratic Party chair Bill Press has made 
a half-dozen forays into Orange County in the past year, trying his best to 
interest a hostile audience in Kathleen Brown and Tom Umberg. Sorry Bill, 
Kathleen's baggage is too heavy. Brother Jerry and father Pat never ran well in 
Orange County, and Kathleen's attempt to distance herself from her own name is 
as implausible as it has been ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 As for young Tom Umberg, well, Orange County is a pretty sophisticated place. 
Umberg's antics on the Assembly Committee on Public Safety did not escape 
notice. Umberg's political schizophrenia -- reliable ally of Speaker Willie 
Brown while in Sacramento, tough-tally candidate while in-county -- was noticed 
long ago. Umberg would not have won reelection in his district had he run. The 
proof: Jim Morissey will capture the 69th fairly handily. Umberg got out of 
Dodge before the voters' posse arrived. But his election make-over won't pass 
in Orange County, where Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren may well be the single most 
popular statewide elected official. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Measure A Wins: Twelve hours of radio and 10 hours of television a month 
bring me into conversation with a lot of folks. I am thus no longer surprised 
to learn how deeply the Clinton-Feinstein defense build-down has cut. The 
reckless rush to shutter the state's defense industry built a malicious synergy 
with the base closure plans on Tustin and El Toro, as well as with a business 
climate gone sour after 20 years of Sacramento looting and a dozen years of 
random darts thrown at business by the likes of the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District. The damage done to Orange County's industrial and 
manufacturing job base was huge, which brings us to Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of life in Orange County depends, first and foremost, on its 
high-wage job base, a base that eroded before the electorate's eyes in the 
space of a couple of years. The County simply cannot afford the luxury of Larry 
Agran's vision of a vast experimental farm at El Toro. Voters will pull the yes 
lever for Measure A because they know that the schools, the libraries, the 
police and all other services that they demand even from an appropriately 
managed government depend, in the end, on private sector jobs. A high-tech 
airport at El Toro -- safe, quiet, and state-of-the-art -- is the county's 
guarantee of its economic health in the next century. Measure A will pass, and 
by a healthy margin. 
</P>
<P>
 4. The Silva Romp in the Supervisorial 2nd District: Thus far, I've focused on 
issues every county voter will confront. But one race, more than all the 
others, ought to finally still the occasional media-based ruminations on the 
changing face of Orange County's politics. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an open seat on the Board of Supervisors in the 2nd District. Reagan 
Republican Jim Silva won Round One, and is in a runoff with liberal Democrat 
Linda Moulton Patterson. Moulton Patterson has been telling everyone who will 
listen that this is a "nonpartisan" race, and her national political 
preferences don't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, she has no choice but to deny the relevance of her liberal record. 
As a Clinton delegate at the 1992 Democratic convention, Moulton Patterson's 
bedrock ideas are pretty obvious. Two years ago, when Harriett Wieder and a 
handful of occasional Republicans of obscure origin and even less influence 
declared for Bill Clinton, the media went nuts declaring a sea change in Orange 
County's political climate. All nonsense, of course, but Moulton Patterson 
evidently was inspired by Wieder's leadership and jumped with glee into the 
Clinton campaign. Now that the President's appeal has dropped to an even more 
microscopic level in the county, Harriett's retired, the other (Benedict) 
Arnolds are nowhere to be seen, and Moulton Patterson is desperate to appear as 
anything other than what she is, a lifelong liberal Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sorry. Jim Silva's just about the model for a successful Orange County 
candidate -- competent, experienced and personally modest. His low-key but 
believable commitment to low taxes and his support for public safety issues 
would have brought him a win anyway. Linda Moulton Patterson's ideological ties 
to Boxer-Feinstein-Clinton, however, guarantee Silva a runaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, not even Orange County could anchor California to an agenda of 
common sense. It was an odd year then, and the county electorate could only 
stand aside and shake a collective head at the silliness statewide. This year, 
however, this county is in the driver's seat. And without a moment to spare.

 Re: Articles by Mark Leyes and Eugene Moriarty (Oct. 16):

<P>
 It seemed that both these gentlemen are having a love affair with airport 
runways and their utilization. May I suggest that these gentlemen go to 
Victorville, Palmdale and Mojave and hug the runways there! There is land 
space, no congestion, and accessibility to all of these airports.

 There would be no threat to economic security in El Toro, as Leyes suggests, 
because if the property is utilized properly there would be increased 
employment for the developed area. Those of us that live in the El Toro 
corridors did so voluntarily. We knew it would be noisy at times because it was 
a military establishment. We also knew the flights were limited to the training 
mission. A commercial airport is unacceptable for those that will be affected 
by its constant use. We would have no choice in the matter since we are already 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 It is nice to live in Garden Grove, Mr. Leyes, and discuss the effect on 
lifestyle in another community. Moriarty's article smells of special interest 
rather then what is good for El Toro and its surrounding communities. If (he) 
thinks another airport is necessary, why not work for an "offshore airport" 
similar to he one completed in Japan?

 * Your argument ("A Rush to Judgment on El Toro Airport," Oct. 16) that 
Measure A is a hasty and poorly drawn proposition may be true. However, to say 
that Orange County and its nine-person commission can fairly decide on an 
airport at El Toro is complete fiction. Two supervisors and the other four 
ad-hoc members from neighboring cities have as much as said, "No airport!" That 
comes to a 6-to-3 vote against an airport, at best. The real reason you and 
South Countians are against an El Toro commercial airport is noise. After what 
(Supervisor Thomas F.) Riley did to Newport Beach who can blame them. Here are 
the facts: 
</P>
<P>
 * John Wayne is nearly at capacity. It will take about 10 years to get El Toro 
operational. By then, it will be badly needed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airports pay their own way. If El Toro can't, it won't be built, regardless 
of the vote on A. 
</P>
<P>
 * Noise is the real issue. If El Toro can't be feasible by using only the 
east-facing runways, which will impact zero homes, it won't be built. No one 
wants another John Wayne, with the accompanying lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 What needs to be done is more testing to see if the above points are feasible. 
Measure A will do the testing for feasibility at El Toro. If it can't be built 
without county funds and without negatively affecting surrounding homeowners, 
it won't be built. Passing Measure A will only give an airport a fair hearing, 
something Riley, et al., will never give it.

<P>
 Initiative backers are asking the general population to vote on a vitally 
important matter without expert knowledge or study. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A, if passed, could back us into a corner if the site is unusable 
under FAA standards, and if it is built, into county financial disaster if not 
economically sound.

consequences, we too should slow down, let the studies be made, the experts 
advise and only then a decision be made.

 * Surprise! Surprise! The Los Angeles Times has done it again, coming out 
against Measure A, doing what it can to keep Orange County down on the farm and 
economically dependent upon Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question about it, the Los Angeles Times cares little of the 
135,000 jobs lost throughout Orange County and its effect on the people of 
Orange County. The Los Angeles Times cares about Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, 60% or some 8 million air passengers from Orange County will drive 
this year to Los Angeles International Airport or some other airport to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure to capture the El Toro Airport opportunity will place a cap on 
economic growth in Orange County while Los Angeles International Airport 
prospers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times says we have time. Sure, let's wait another 20 years and let Orange 
County lose out on access to the Pacific Rim and NAFTA while Los Angeles 
prospers. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the Orange County Board of Supervisors Resolution 85-1231: John 
Wayne Airport "is incapable of meeting the full level of air travel demand in 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that every land-use planning decision in the last 50 plus years has 
been based upon the fact that El Toro is an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what do you expect, more studies? El Toro has been studied 18 times in 
30 years. The FAA says that El Toro Marine Corps Air Station offers an 
opportunity, and unless timely action is taken, economic interaction between 
Orange County and the rest of the nation will be seriously impeded. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right L.A. Times, let's take more time to study the issue, while Orange 
County drifts and stagnates economically. I guess the L.A. Times feels about 
Orange County the way Martin Bernheimer feels about the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center: Don't try to compete with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Vote "yes" on A -- it's the right choice for Orange County.

TROJANS ALMOST TOO GOOD FOR WORDS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: OTTON IS SHARP AGAIN IN 
61-0 VICTORY OVER CAL, KEEPING USC'S ROSE BOWL HOPES ALIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California Coach Keith Gilbertson, who had just found himself on the wrong end 
of a 61-0 football game, said more or less what everyone else did Saturday 
night at the Coliseum.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one else did, either, Coach.  
</P>
<P>
 Even John Robinson groped uncharacteristically for words. He was the big 
winner, but he could only shrug and say: "I feel sorry for Cal -- it was one of 
those nights when everything went wrong for them." 
</P>
<P>
 After Saturday's victory before 55,213, the Trojans' third in a row, Robinson 
said he believes some new energy has gripped his team.  
</P>
<P>
 "Something is happening with this team, and I want to get it back on the 
practice field and hold on to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (5-2 and 4-1 in the Pacifi 10) has a bye week coming up, then plays at 
Washington State Nov. 5, hosts Arizona Nov. 12 and meets UCLA Nov. 19 at the 
Rose Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said Saturday he would just as soon skip the bye, and small wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 And to reach the Rose Bowl, the victors agreed they have to win them all, 
noting that Oregon had beaten Washington, 31-20. The Ducks also have only one 
Pac-10 loss and own a victory over the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 "After this, there's no doubt in my mind we can win the rest of them, but I'm 
not going to waste time worrying about what Oregon's going to to," USC 
offensive tackle Tony Boselli said. The Trojans, behind quarterback Brad Otton, 
filling in again for injured Rob Johnson, ran to a 35-0 halftime lead, employed 
kicker Cole Ford's kickoffs to keep Cal in poor field position all game and ran 
up a victory margin of historic dimensions.  
</P>
<P>
 It was: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The most points scored by USC since a 66-10 victory over Utah State in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The widest winning margin since a 63-0 victory over Oregon State in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC's first shutout since a 19-0 victory over Stanford in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The most points given up by Cal since a 61-21 loss to UCLA in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 And to think all week Robinson fretted that his defense had surrendered 
touchdowns to every opponent this year on first or second possessions.  
</P>
<P>
 Cal not only didn't score on its first or second drive, it went 0 for 13.  
</P>
<P>
 Was this a team that took a major step up in quality or of a team hitting rock 
bottom? 
</P>
<P>
 "USC is awfully good," Gilbertson said. "They're improving every week, and 
they're certainly athletic." 
</P>
<P>
 USC caught a break in the first second of the game and never looked back. The 
Cal kicker, Ryan Longwell, fell down on the opening kickoff, got off a poor 
kick, and USC was in business at its own 44.  
</P>
<P>
 It became clear at the outset that Cal was overplaying USC's run game, mindful 
no doubt of tailback Shawn Walters' 234-yard game at Stanford last week. 
Walters gained only four yards on the first two plays, but on third and six, 
Otton connected with Keyshawn Johnson (four catches for 110 yards) on a 41-yard 
play to Cal's 11.  
</P>
<P>
 Walters was stymied twice more, but Otton found fullback Terry Barnum all 
alone in the end zone for an easy touchdown after only 2:44. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, 5-foot-8 senior cornerback Jerald Henry contributed a big play. He and 
Sammy Knight blocked a Bear field-goal try on Cal's second drive and Henry 
picked the ball up and scooted 60 yards for a touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 By now, Gilbertson could see what kind of game was unfolding.  
</P>
<P>
 "It started with that opening kickoff," he said. "Our kicker falls down, then 
we get a kick blocked and they run it back. Then a punt hits our guy in the 
back, and we lose that ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one thing after another." 
</P>
<P>
 It got much worse for Cal. Robinson's third- and fourth-stringers put two 
touchdowns on the board in the fourth quarter, when No. 3 quarterback Matt 
Koffler was running the offense. The Trojans didn't need a running first down 
until the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 USC stuttered only briefly at the outset, when it was clear Cal would try to 
stop Walters (76 yards in 15 carries) at almost any cost.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were lining up with nine guys up front, all in the box, but I knew that 
meant they couldn't stop our passing game," Boselli said.  
</P>
<P>
 Said USC offensive line coach Mike Barry: "We ran on them pretty good up there 
last year (in a 42-14 Trojan victory), and we knew he'd (Gilbertson) commit 
heavy to the run.  
</P>
<P>
 "We changed some blocking schemes and got some creases." 
</P>
<P>
 Otton, who completed 15 of 20 passes for 196 yards and two touchdowns, was a 
laid-back winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even remember the first half." he said. "It seems like a day ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're a lot more confident now. . . . I can see it in the huddle, the spark 
in our eyes. And scoring 60 points doesn't hurt, either. I'm just playing and 
having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 And he said he's still a sub.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is still Rob's show," Otton said. "I'm playing for him and having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has had two ankle sprains the past month, hopes to be back for 
Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, it was a big-play defensive game for USC. USC sacked Cal 
quarterbacks four times, and linebacker Brian Williams had two of them. Six 
passes and two field goals were blocked.  
</P>
<P>
 USC has now played three turnover-free games in a row.  
</P>
<P>
 Craig Fertig, the 1960s Trojan quarterback and now a team broadcaster, was 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been around here a long time and I've never seen anything like that," he 
said afterward. "The efficiency . . . it's the best game I've ever seen an SC 
team play." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, he might be overlooking that 55-24 comeback victory over Notre Dame in 
1974, but we'll cut him a little slack. USC's Biggest Blowouts

A WACKY VICTORY FOR UTAH; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: UTES HOLD OFF COLORADO STATE IN 
BATTLE OF WAC UNBEATENS, 45-31. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You needed No-Doz in the first half and a calculator in the second to properly 
appreciate 18th-ranked Utah's 45-31 victory over No. 12 Colorado State on 
Saturday in a battle of Western Athletic Conference unbeatens. 
</P>
<P>
 A 9-7 game at halftime turned into a combined 60-point scorefest in the last 
two quarters. In those crazed final 30 minutes, there were four lead changes, 
seven offensive touchdowns, two two-point conversions, two bizarre formations, 
one field goal and one 100-yard interception return. No wonder the Hughes 
Stadium scoreboard malfunctioned late in the third quarter; its press box 
operator had finger cramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when the WAC thought it was turning into the Big Ten Jr. -- "We Love 
Defense!" -- the ghosts from the conference's past arrived in time for the 
second half, transforming a dull, error-filled game into a thrilling, 
error-filled finish. It was the WAC at its former best: unpredictable, unusual 
and, at times, unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always call it the 'Wacky WAC,' " Utah quarterback Mike McCoy said, 
"because you never know what's going to happen. Today was one of those wacky 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 The strangeness began with the rankings and the records. Since when did Utah 
and Colorado State begin the eighth week of the season with unbeaten records 
and a nation's attention? And who's the WAC propaganda expert who convinced 
everyone that actual defense was played in this league? 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, Utah, supposedly the fourth-best defensive team in the country, 
had given up 31 points and 470 yards. And Colorado State, coached by Sonny 
Lubick, architect of Miami's defense during two national championship seasons, 
watched as McCoy completed 25 of 33 passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect it to be anything like that," McCoy said. "It was just big 
play after big play." 
</P>
<P>
 And this from Colorado State cornerback Ray Jackson, who shook his head in 
disbelief when reminded of the second-half scoring outburst: "I figured there 
might be another field goal or two. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State (7-1) can blame only itself for the loss. Never mind the 
third-quarter lead it let slip away, or the failure to hold after tying the 
score, 31-31, in the fourth quarter. What killed the Rams was their mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The list: 
</P>
<P>
 -- One blocked punt that resulted in seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two interceptions returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One botched snap that resulted in a safety. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One fumbled kickoff return that resulted in seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One blocked field-goal try. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One blocked conversion kick. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One interception that ended a potential scoring driving in the waning 
minutes of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One botched attempt to call a timeout. Utah scored on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 It got so bad for Colorado State that George Schramm, a reserve defensive end 
who plays on special teams, lined up on Utah's side of the ball for a Ram 
kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like everything that could go wrong did go wrong for us," Lubick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah (7-0) wasn't without its mistakes. The Utes had two punts blocked, blew 
leads of their own, gave up nearly 500 yards, fumbled three times, threw one 
interception and were whistled for 14 penalties and 117 yards. But when it 
counted, Utah delivered the kind of plays that used to make the 
trick-play-happy WAC proud. 
</P>
<P>
 With his team trailing, 17-16, with less than five minutes left in the third 
quarter, Utah's Charlie Brown ran 44 yards for a touchdown. Rather than kick 
the extra point, offensive coordinator Rick Rasnick called for a two-point 
conversion and used a special formation named "Anaheim," which was designed for 
last year's Freedom Bowl. Utah hadn't used the formation this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State, which later insisted that it practiced against the formation, 
didn't have a clue. The Utes stepped to the line of scrimmage and then moved 
four players to the far left side, four to the middle and two in between. McCoy 
took the shotgun snap and hit Rob Hamilton for the conversion, giving Utah a 
24-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were awfully confused," McCoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next possession, this time with the ball on the Colorado State 
five-yard line, the Utes did the same thing. The Rams' Jackson saw the shift 
coming and immediately tried signaling for a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 Too late. McCoy found tight end Rick Tucker for the easy score as two blockers 
on the left side wiped out Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just looking at those big boys out there and they're coming right at me," 
said Jackson, 5 feet 10 and 190 pounds. "Wow, what a play. But I don't know 
what happened with the timeout. The ref was sitting right there and I was right 
in his face. I guess he was sitting in the twilight zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State knows the feeling. The Rams tied the score with more than 10 
minutes left, but then gave up another touchdown and were reduced to a 
desperation drive in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 It almost worked. Starting at their 24, the Rams moved to the Utah 10. 
Forty-four seconds remained. Fourth and eight. Quarterback Anthoney Hill, who 
had thrown into double and triple coverage all day, tried to needle the ball to 
wide receiver Matt Phillips in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, free safety Harold Lusk stepped in front of Phillips and didn't stop 
running until 100 yards later. So much for the Colorado State comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never done that before," Lusk said. "All I can say is, thank God I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Lusk said what he really wanted was a shutout. "But, you know, you can't get 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Greedy guy. In this case, a wonderful WAC kind of victory will have to do.

BRUINS' SMALL ACHIEVEMENT IS SHORT-LIVED; UCLA: ARIZONA FALLS BEHIND BRIEFLY, 
THEN PULLS AWAY TO HAND DONAHUE'S TEAM ITS SIXTH LOSS IN A ROW, 34-24. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It had been so long -- 5 hours 38 minutes 18 seconds of game time. Long enough 
to fly to New York into a head wind. Almost two nights of prime time. Time 
enough to watch almost three innings of Ken Burns' "Baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Longer than any UCLA coach has slept in a night since the Bruins last held a 
lead, five weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, with 6:42 to play in the third quarter, Daron Washington scored from 
the one-yard line. The Bruins had a 17-14 lead and the 22-quarter streak was 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 However, another started 5:36 later, when Arizona's Dan White threw to Lamar 
Harris for a 14-yard touchdown to put the Wildcats back in control. 
</P>
<P>
 A more important streak is intact. UCLA lost its sixth game in a row, 34-24, 
before 58,817, a record for 65-year-old Arizona Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 A loss to Stanford next Saturday in the Rose Bowl would tie the school record 
for futility: seven losses in a row, set in 1940 and tied in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the lead and it felt good," Bruin quarterback Wayne Cook said. "When 
you have positive things happen, people feed off that. Too bad we didn't keep 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA lost it because Arizona fed off the Bruin secondary, with White 
completing 14 of 21 passes for 211 yards and two touchdowns. Ten of the 
completions and both of the touchdown passes came on third-down plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried all-out blitzes with man-to-man coverages, four-man rushes with 
two-deep zones and four-man rushes with straight-across zone," said Bob Field, 
UCLA's defensive coordinator. "I don't know any other way to defend against 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing zone, we were playing man, we were blitzing, we were doing 
everything we could," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. "Their quarterback did a 
good job of keeping his poise and getting the ball up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had defended on third down, it might have been closer, but we couldn't 
control them on third down." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the reason for that was Richard Dice's work against UCLA's diminutive 
cornerbacks, Teddy Lawrence and Javelin Guidry. Dice is 6 feet 2, Lawrence and 
Guidry about 5-9 each, and the mismatch was apparent in the second quarter when 
Arizona took a 14-7 lead after White went to Dice on an eight-yard scoring play 
against Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't cover well," Lawrence said. "He's big, and I'm at a 
disadvantage, but I needed to make that play. If I had covered well all day, we 
might have won." 
</P>
<P>
 Dice caught six passes for 138 yards before leaving the game in the fourth 
quarter because of a bruised knee. Five of the six catches -- including one 
play of 61 yards -- came on third down and all six got first downs for Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Bruins, playing better than they had since winning their second 
game of the season, against Southern Methodist, came back. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjorn Merten cut the Wildcats' lead to 14-10 with a 19-yard field goal as the 
first half ended. UCLA drove 49 yards to Washington's touchdown and a 17-14 
lead in the third quarter, with most of the yardage coming on Cook-to-Kevin 
Jordan passes. They hooked up three times on passes of 19, 12 and six yards to 
the Arizona six, and Washington scored three plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (2-6, 0-5 in the Pacific 10) couldn't keep it because 14th-ranked 
Arizona (6-1, 4-0) showed why it is in control of the Rose Bowl race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats drove 64 yards in 11 plays, two of them White-to-Dice connections 
of 13 and 20 yards, the latter on third down, again against Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 White's touchdown pass to Harris covered 14 yards and gave Arizona a 21-17 
lead, which it opened to 24-17 in the fourth quarter on Steve McLaughlin's 
44-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We answered their lead," Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said. "That was the most 
positive aspect of the game. It was a tough game, even with the first-place 
team playing the last." 
</P>
<P>
 It got tougher quickly for UCLA, which was trying to tie the score early in 
the final quarter. After two first downs put the ball on the Bruin 47, Cook was 
sacked by Joe Salave'a and fumbled, with UCLA's Chad Sauter falling on the ball 
for an 18-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
 An incomplete pass later, Cook faced third and 28, going to Avery Anderson for 
an 11-yard gain. Salave'a hit Anderson, with the fumble squirting to Spencer 
Wray, who returned it 15 yards to the UCLA 26. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin's 24-yard field goal gave Arizona a 27-17 lead and Ontiwaun 
Carter's second touchdown, on a one-yard run, closed the Wildcat scoring. 
Carter rushed for 164 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were fighting, but I think the (Anderson) turnover put a stake in their 
heart," said Wildcat defensive end Tedy Bruschi, who broke up two passes at the 
line of scrimmage and occupied Bruin blockers enough for teammates to sack Cook 
three times. He sacked himself twice, falling over the feet of offensive 
linemen, and the five sacks totaled 42 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really wanted to avoid that kind of situation," Donahue said. "We did that 
in the first half, but in the second half that got away from us a little bit. 
Cook lost the ball in the pocket. Another time it was going to be third and 10, 
and it ended up third and 19. Those are hard conversions to make, especially 
against a top-flight team like Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona had no trouble with them. On third down, the Wildcats were right where 
they wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA now has a losing record guaranteed. "At this point in the season, it's 
pure frustration," said Cook, who completed 16 of 33 passes for 245 yards and 
two touchdowns, to Jordan (eight catches, 111 yards) and to Mike Nguyen, the 
latter coming when victory was out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a nightmare to have such a good team last year and now lose six 
straight." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons for last year's good team was J.J. Stokes, who played 
Saturday. Stokes, sidelined most of the season because of a bruised leg, caught 
one pass for 18 yards. "They had J.J. back, and I'd feel more confident if I 
had J.J. back," Bruschi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins were, but the confidence is muted by six weeks of futility. "I 
thought we had our chances," Donahue said, "but we couldn't quite seem to get 
over the hump with the chances we had." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the hump is a mountain, and UCLA is in a valley so deep that 
even having a lead looks good. Even one that lasts only 5:36.

MIKE PENNER: WITH EVERETT AT SUPERDOME, HISTORY WON'T REPEAT ITSELF

 This week in the NFL . . .

<P>
 NEW ORLEANS -- The much-trumpeted resurgence of Jim Everett continues as the 
Saints' quarterback throws for 355 yards -- 315 coming in the fourth quarter, 
with the Saints trailing, 24-3. Those tiresome critics who used to carp about 
the Rams never being able to win at the Superdome with Everett on the field are 
silenced at last.

 LOS ANGELES -- Art Shell names Harvey Williams his starting tailback and calls 
for 23 consecutive belly-dive handoffs to Williams, just to see Jeff 
Hostetler's reaction. Hostetler keeps his mouth shut and refuses to audibilize, 
but the rest of the Raider offense revolts, and Shell benches them all. 
Hostetler returns to the field, snaps the ball to himself, is sacked 31 times 
in a row and Raiders lose to Falcons, 42-0.

 SAN DIEGO -- Anthony Miller slinks back to Jack Murphy Stadium averaging 2.4 
catches per game and one victory every six games. Denver Broncos Coach Wade 
Phillips explains away the sluggish start by calling Miller "too fast" for 
quarterback John Elway's precision timing throws. In related news, Phillips 
calls the Bronco defense, which has been allowing nearly 30 points per game, 
"too strong," "too tall," "too aggressive," "too manly" and "really, much too 
evolved for this primitive species we call Homo sapiens. "

 DETROIT -- Scott Mitchell, winless in his last three starts, gets the call at 
quarterback for the Detroit Lions. Steve Walsh, undefeated in his last three 
starts, gets replaced by Erik Kramer at quarterback for the Chicago Bears. 
Future headline: "Minnesota, Green Bay to Represent NFC Central in 1994 
Playoffs."

 SAN FRANCISCO -- Deion Sanders returns a Craig Erickson interception 99 yards, 
tears a groin muscle while high-stepping the final 69 yards, is wheeled into 
the Candlestick Park interview room and declares, "This is my house. I built 
this house. I remodeled this house. I wood-paneled this house. I aluminum-sided 
this house. I shag-carpeted this house. I'm going to sublet this house. My 
house. MY HOUSE." Just then, another wide receiver swats Sanders in the head, 
and Jerry Rice heads for the showers, feeling a whole lot better.

 CLEVELAND -- David Klingler, 4-23 as an NFL starter and currently the 
28th-ranked passer in the league, claims to have the solution for embattled 
Cincinnati Bengals Coach David Shula. "I want to throw 50 times a game," 
Klingler is quoted in the local newspapers. "Shut up and hand the ball to Faulk 
," Shula tells his quarterback. "But, Coach, we didn't draft Faulk," Klingler 
replies. "Damn," Shula says. "You're right. Why didn't we?" Klingler shrugs and 
hands the ball to Steve Broussard. Cleveland beats Cincinnati, 56-6, in front 
of 60,000 fans pressing transistor radios to their ears, hoping to hear how the 
Indians are doing in Game 2 of the World Series but getting nothing but white 
noise.

 TEMPE, Ariz. -- Arizona hosts Dallas two weeks after the Cowboys trounced the 
Cardinals, 38-3, at Texas Stadium. Arizona Coach Buddy Ryan was reported to 
have called that defeat "a lesson in humility," but a source close to Ryan 
disputes this: "Buddy doesn't know the meaning of the word 'humility.' If you 
want to know the truth, it was a lesson in not starting Jay Schroeder at 
quarterback when Steve Beuerlein is available; in not handing the ball to Larry 
Centers when Ron Moore is in the same backfield; in not relegating your top 
1993 draft pick, Garrison Hearst, to the scout team when your ground game is 
last in the league; and not saying anything that might possibly annoy Emmitt 
Smith. This includes 'Hi, Emmitt,' 'Goodby, Emmitt,' and 'Could you please sign 
this football, Emmitt, once you've finished spiking it, of course?' "

 KANSAS CITY -- Having taken advantage of the bye week to mail-order a new

Seattle Seahawks, who are 3-3 and haven't been coached by Chuck Knox for 2 1/2

 EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Bill Cowher and Dan Reeves bring their struggling 
teams to Giants Stadium for an interconference clash between the Pittsburgh 
Steelers and the New York Giants. After watching his team defeat Cincinnati, 
14-10, last week, Cowher commented, "It wasn't a Mozart." And Reeves, after 
watching young quarterback Dave Brown mangle four quarters against the Rams in 
Anaheim, was heard to say, "It wasn't a Simms."

 INDIANAPOLIS -- First, T.J. Rubley for the Rams and now Gus Frerotte starts 
for the Washington Redskins against Indianapolis, making the University of 
Tulsa the new world leader in emergency quarterbacks for rotten NFL teams.

 PHILADELPHIA -- No World Series, no hockey and it's Houston versus 
Philadelphia on "Monday Night Football." A nation turns its lonely eyes to 
Billy Joe Tolliver dropping back into the pocket and turns the channel.

MORNING BRIEFING: ANDES BEAN MIGHT BE THE ONE TO APPRECIATE THESE CADDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The newest caddies at a golf course in Horsham, Pa., won't have any trouble 
carrying a heavy load. They may, however, breach golf etiquette at times, since 
they tend to spit when angry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Talamore at Oak Terrace course plans to let golfers have llamas lug their 
clubs around the links. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a novelty," a club spokesman said. "People will never forget that 
round of golf." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost alone should keep the round fresh in their memory. Llama caddies cost 
$100 per player.

 Trivia time: What combination holds the Ram record for the longest pass play? 
</P>
<P>
 Who cares?Ray Ratto in the San Francisco Examiner: "Cincinnati quarterback 
Dave Klingler says he wants to throw 50 times a game to help the Bengals win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cincinnati Coach Dave Shula says that's too many throws. We say it doesn't 
make any difference who wins that argument." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals are 0-6.

<P>
 Waste of time: Paul Westhead, George Mason University basketball coach, a 
proponent of run-and-gun basketball, believes that six weeks of preseason 
drills is too long: 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing you wind up accomplishing in that much time without playing 
games is the players really start to hate each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Pocket change: Tom Weir in USA Today: "Glenn (Big Dog) Robinson treats a $60 
million guaranteed contract from the Milwaukee Bucks as if it's Alpo. Uh, 
Glenn, just because they're called the Bucks doesn't mean they own the mint." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver who?Tony Kornheiser in the Washington Post on the reigning World Boxing 
Council heavyweight champion:  
</P>
<P>
 "Seriously, if someone came up to you and asked: 'Who is the WBC heavyweight 
champion of the world?' how many names would you go through before you got to

 "You'd try Oliver Twist and Lauren Bacall first."

GOLF ROUNDUP; ROOKIE LEADS AT LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Furyk, a rookie with a highly unorthodox swing, had three consecutive 
birdies in a six-under-par 66 Saturday and took a one-shot lead after four 
rounds of the 90-hole, $1.5-million Las Vegas Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Lietzke birdied four of the last five holes and Kirk Triplett birdied 18 
and were tied for second. 
</P>
<P>
 Furyk, at 21-under 266, wasn't too concerned about either the swing or the 
lead going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be leading," he said. "You never want to start out behind. But 
the only time your position matters is when you hole out on Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 And as to the swing -- he takes the club back far to the outside, then drops 
it inside -- he shrugged. "It's a natural swing. I'm not going to change. I'm 
stuck with it, whether I like it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Furyk played the front side in 31 and, at that point, had a three-shot lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been in that position before, leading by three shots," he said. 
"That was kind of exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Furyk had the best finish of his brief career this year, a tie for seventh at 
Tucson. He went into that final round tied for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous starting out, and I guess I probably will be 
tomorrow," he said. "I think anybody would be nervous, leading the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Lietzke shot 66 and Triplett had a 68. They were followed by Billy Andrade and 
Guy Boros, son of the late Hall of Famer Julius Boros, another stroke behind at 
268. Andrade shot 67 and Boros 68. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Brandie Burton made five birdies and Beth Daniel had four in winning separate 
matches, and the Americans put a stop to Laura Davies to pull even with Europe 
in the Solheim Cup at White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States won three of five four-ball matches to even the three-day 
event, 5-5. Ten singles matches remain today in the Ryder Cup-style tournament 
of the United States vs. Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton birdied three holes on the back as she and Dottie Mochrie earned a 
2-and-1 comeback victory over Davies and Alison Nicholas of Britain. Daniel and 
Meg Mallon were never threatened in a 7-and-5 victory over Annika Sorenstam and 
Catrin Nilsmark of Sweden.

EVERYONE'S PUTTING A DENT IN RANCHO; GOLF: EICHELBERGER TIES COURSE RECORD WITH 
A 62, ONE BETTER THAN DENT, WHO LEADS BY ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poor old Rancho Park. Look what happened to the place Saturday when a bunch of 
guys started beating it to death with clubs -- golf clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Park might as well have been Yellowstone Park the way everybody was 
camping out on the greens and making putts that looked about as easy as rolling 
a marble into a manhole. 
</P>
<P>
 No one had a better day at the Ralphs Senior Classic than Dave Eichelberger, 
who tied the course record with a nine-under-par 62 and offered a simple 
explanation afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just played real good," Eichelberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Jim Dent followed his first-round 68 with a 63 that included two 
eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent's lead at 11-under 131 is one shot over Eichelberger, three over Bob 
Dickson and Jack Kiefer, and four over J.C. Snead, Jimmy Powell, Jim Colbert 
and George Shortridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent bagged eagles on the 500-yard eighth hole, when he knocked a three-iron 
to 15 feet, and on the 475-yard 11th, where he chipped in from 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles are where you find them, Dent said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to catch 'em when they come and shoot 'em down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, it has been a shooting gallery at Rancho Park. Through two 
rounds, there have been 70 rounds in the 60s, 41 of them Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dent said it is still too early to say bad things about the course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no, Rancho Park is going to catch up," he said. "If the weather changes, 
if there is wind, watch out. You'd better get it when you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody was getting it Saturday, no one better than Eichelberger. 
</P>
<P>
 His 62 tied the course record set by Raymond Floyd in 1992. It was also 
Eichelberger's lowest round since he shot a 62 in Atlanta 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a while," Eichelberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned it. From No. 6 through No. 14, a stretch of nine holes, Eichelberger 
made eight birdies. He birdied the back-to-back par fives, No. 8 and No. 9, 
even though he was in greenside bunkers on both holes. 
</P>
<P>
 He needed only 21 putts. After a bogey on the first hole, Eichelberger played 
the last 17 holes in 10 under par. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of all this scoring has made one thing perfectly clear to 
Eichelberger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a feeling I'd better shoot 64 or 65 (today)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is the Dent Factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably the man to beat, the way he hits it," Eichelberger said. "These 
par fives are just long fours to him.' 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing like a par five to make a big hitter happy, and Dent has been 
the biggest hitter on the Senior PGA Tour since he joined it in 1989. This 
year, Dent is leading the tour in driving distance a sixth consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent said there are three reasons why he hits drives as long as he ever has. 
</P>
<P>
 "Metal woods, graphite and good golf balls," said Dent, who admitted he has a 
certain affinity for par fives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like par fives when I can reach them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickson, who shot a 64, doesn't hit the ball long, but he knows how to putt. 
He had birdies on Nos. 15-16-17 with birdie putts from six feet to 12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 He also pitched in from 40 feet for a birdie on No. 2, but said there's one 
facet of his game that needs some work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to figure out how to drive it longer," he said. "It's always an 
advantage to be two-putting for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big hitters have an advantage every week. Give me a guy who has a 30-foot 
putt for an eagle versus a guy with a 50-foot chip shot for an eagle every 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Dent said hitting it long is fine, all right, but with a provision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Length is good on any course if you can hit it straight," he said. "Straight 
is the important part."

SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP; FOR RICE, CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corey Pullig passed for one touchdown and saved another with a tremendous 
tackle on a fumble return as Texas A&M fought off upstart Rice, 7-0, Saturday 
at College Station, Tex., for its 26th consecutive Southwest Conference victory 
and 14th in a row over the Owls. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 25th consecutive victory at home for the Aggies, 6-0 overall and 
4-0 in the SWC. The close loss for Rice (3-3, 2-1) comes six days after a 19-17 
victory over No. 13 Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we gained a little more respect today," Rice Coach Ken Hatfield said. 
"A&M made one more play than we did. We were just one play short of doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played two nationally ranked teams in less than a week. We beat one and 
came pretty close today against a great team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies struck quickly against the 20-point underdogs for the game's only 
touchdown. Halfback Rodney Thomas took a short swing pass from Pullig and 
followed a block by wide receiver Chris Sanders on a 60-yard scoring play less 
than two minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pullig made his touchdown-saving tackle in the fourth quarter, chasing down 
Rice defensive end Andy Clifton as he returned Leeland McElroy's fumble 20 
yards to the Aggies' 43. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was the only one with a shot at him," Pullig said. "I knew I had to 
bring him down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies rolled up 395 yards of total offense. Thomas rushed 21 times for 
136 yards and Pullig was 17 of 25 for 191 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 13 Texas 42, Southern Methodist 20 -- Rodrick Walker ran for two 
touchdowns and backup quarterback James Brown revived a sluggish offense as the 
Longhorns (5-2, 2-1) recorded an SWC victory at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first two series, Texas appeared to be showing the effects of a 
tumultuous week in which the Longhorns tried to put player suspensions and 
their first loss to Rice in 29 years behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 After SMU (1-7, 0-4) put together a 13-play touchdown drive on its first 
possession, Texas went three-and-out on its first drive and fumbled the ball to 
SMU on the first play of its second possession. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:23 left in the first quarter and Texas trailing 7-0, Coach John 
Mackovic replaced starter Shea Morenz with Brown, a redshirt freshman who had 
guided Texas to a 17-10 victory over Oklahoma earlier in the season when Morenz 
was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who drew roaring cheers when he entered the game, hit Curtis Jackson 
with a perfect 39-yard strike down the left sideline, putting the ball on the 
SMU 38. Three plays later, Walker, who finished with 107 yards in 15 carries, 
scored on a 19-yard touchdown, although replays showed he appeared to step out 
of bounds at the three. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech 38, Baylor 7 -- Zebbie Lethridge threw for two touchdowns and ran 
for another and the Red Raiders (3-4, 2-2) had four interceptions at Lubbock, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most points and biggest margin of victory this season for the Red 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears (5-3, 2-2) didn't score after the first quarter. They didn't have a 
first down or complete a pass in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Christian 31, Houston 10 -- Max Knake threw three touchdown passes to 
Brian Collins as TCU (4-3, 1-2) took advantage of four turnovers to beat the 
Cougars (1-6, 1-2) at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Horned Frogs led, 17-0, at halftime, but Houston staged a mini-comeback 
behind reserve quarterback Chad O'Shea, cutting TCU's lead to 24-10. Knake 
wrapped up the victory with scoring strikes of 29 and 22 yards to Collins.

COLORADO BUFFS FOR BIG GAME; BIG EIGHT: OPTION ATTACK TUNES UP FOR NEBRASKA 
WITH 35-21 VICTORY OVER KANSAS STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Showing off an option attack that would have made past Oklahoma teams green 
with envy, Colorado can finally focus fully on the opponent outlined in red on 
its schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Rashaan Salaam, the nation's leading rusher and scorer, ran for 202 yards and 
two scores, and quarterback Kordell Stewart rushed for 127 yards and three 
touchdowns, leading No. 2 Colorado to a 35-21 victory over stubborn No. 19 
Kansas State on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Option plays produced scoring runs of 53 and 60 yards as the Buffaloes (7-0, 
3-0 Big Eight) posted their 11th consecutive victory and set up next week's 
showdown with No. 3 Nebraska at Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my background -- running the option," said Stewart, whose 60-yard run 
accounted for the go-ahead score with 10 minutes left. Stewart then ran seven 
yards with eight seconds remaining for an insurance touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see a gaping hole like that, I love it," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad May's passing and two second-half scoring runs by J.J. Smith -- who had 
three scores in all -- helped Kansas State (4-2, 1-2) draw into ties on two 
occasions during the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's long scoring run came on the fifth play of a 71-yard drive, 
following cornerback Elton Davis' first career interception at the Colorado 29. 
Stewart kept the drive alive by sneaking for a first down on fourth and one 
from the Colorado 38.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was crunch time," Coach Bill McCartney said in explaining the fourth-down 
decision. "I felt our defense had expended a lot of energy, and we needed to 
make something happen offensively. When you have a 212-pound quarterback and a 
good offensive line, you should be able to make a yard." 
</P>
<P>
 May was sidelined for several fourth-quarter plays while being fitted for a 
brace on his twisted right knee. He returned but couldn't move the Wildcats 
beyond their 15 with two minutes left, throwing four consecutive incompletions. 
Moments later, Stewart rolled right and scored the clincher. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way they played defense had us off balance," McCartney said. "I thought 
we would make more plays in the passing game. Obviously, we've got some work to 
do there. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm satisfied where we are and I feel like we're going into Nebraska with 
confidence. I'm not excited about playing morning football -- the start time is 
10 o'clock. But they do it at Wimbledon, so why shouldn't we?" 
</P>
<P>
 May completed 23 of 40 passes for 356 yards, but he had two interceptions and 
was sacked four times.

NEBRASKA AVOIDS NEW DISASTERS; BIG EIGHT: BERRINGER STAYS HEALTHY AND TOSSES 
THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES IN 42-7 WARMUP FOR NO. 2 COLORADO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne only wanted his quarterback to avoid injury. Brook 
Berringer gave him much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Berringer, back as the starter after missing half of last week's game with a 
partially collapsed lung, threw three touchdown passes in the second half as 
the third-ranked Cornhuskers, 8-0 overall, 3-0 in the Big Eight, overcame a 
slow start to beat Missouri, 42-7, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brook can do it all," Osborne said. "Next week, he'll have to do it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska, which also got 110 yards rushing from Lawrence Phillips, is at home 
against No. 2 Colorado next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to try to get Berringer through today without getting hit, and I 
don't think he took any bad blows," Osborne said. "Obviously, we can't sit on 
anything now." 
</P>
<P>
 Berringer sat out the first half of last week's 17-6 victory over Kansas State 
with a partially collapsed lung. He wore a flak jacket in that game, and 
against Missouri, Osborne cut back on his use of the option attack to protect 
Berringer for the bigger games ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We run the option well, but we've got other options," said Berringer, who 
completed nine of 13 passes for 153 yards. "We can throw the ball, we can hand 
it off, we can do a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska didn't have a first down in a scoreless first quarter, yet the issue 
was never in doubt. Missouri, which has lost five in a row at home, averted a 
shutout on a 34-yard touchdown pass from Jeff Handy to Rahsetnu Jenkins with 
7:34 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Missouri Coach Larry Smith could be heard screaming at his 
players behind closed doors to "hold yourselves accountable." He said the team 
gave up after falling behind, 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a pretty sight," Smith said. "It wasn't a pretty sight at all. I'm 
angry, I'm disappointed and they'd better be angry and disappointed too because 
those last three touchdowns never needed to be scored." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska has allowed 16 points in its last three games. Defensive back Barron 
Miles ended a Missouri scoring chance when he forced Joe Freeman to fumble into 
the end zone from the one and returned an interception 27 yards to set up a 
Nebraska score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers also have won 21 in a row in the regular season, 12 in a row 
in the Big Eight, and have a 16-game winning streak against Missouri (2-5, 
1-2). The last six meetings have been by a cumulative 307-72 score. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips recorded his eighth consecutive 100-yard game and scored on a 
five-yard run for the game's first touchdown.

BRUINS' ONE-MAN DEFENSE NOT ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After Arizona scored its last touchdown in Saturday's 34-24 victory over UCLA, 
Bruin linebacker Donnie Edwards walked away from the end zone all alone. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game where UCLA's defense was run over time and again, Edwards made his 
own defensive stand time and again. 
</P>
<P>
 His hit on Arizona quarterback Dan White caused a fumble to set up UCLA's 
first touchdown, which tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 The next series, when Arizona drove to UCLA's eight-yard line, Edwards poked 
the ball out of Ontiwaun Carter's grasp to stall the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, he had a game-high 16 tackles. Fourteen were solo tackles, six for 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, it wasn't nearly enough. UCLA gave up 427 yards, nearly six per play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The individual effort doesn't count unless you win," Edwards said. 
"Third-down conversions just killed us. Washington did this to us and so did 
Arizona. . . . Third and long and we just give it to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Arizona converted 12 third-down situations.  
</P>
<P>
 "This year the world is like a cloud," Edwards said. "Last year, we went to 
the Rose Bowl and it was the total opposite. Every day was like a sunny day." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has been a starter since midway through his freshman season, 
Edwards played in the shadow of Jamir Miller the last two years. His chance to 
shine this year has been in the shadow of a 2-6 season. 
</P>
<P>
 And things were just as bad as they seemed when he awoke for Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards felt under the weather. Unlike the rest of the UCLA defense, he had an 
excuse for playing as if his head were in a fog. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up sick, with flu-like (symptoms) this morning," he said. "The first 
half I had trouble breathing. I don't remember much about (White's fumble) 
because I was dazed by my own hit. The fumble is the last thing I remember 
about that play." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a forgettable day for the defense even on the good plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, though, I felt we had the ball rolling our way," Edwards said. 
"I just knew we were going to win. But it just rolled back the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being sick, Edwards played to the end of the game. It was his third 
sack of White, with 13 minutes to play, that gave UCLA its last hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The sack was one of the few third-down situations on which the Bruins stopped 
the Wildcats. It was third and five from the UCLA 18. The sack forced Arizona 
to kick a 44-yard field goal and kept the Bruins within 24-17. 
</P>
<P>
 His efforts were noticed by the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Donnie Edwards played a great game," Arizona running back Gary Taylor said. 
"We tried running a lot of counter plays, but they did a good job of plugging 
those." 
</P>
<P>
 For White, seeing Edwards in his backfield was a little too familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 White and Edwards went to high schools that were near each other in San Diego. 
White attended Point Loma and Edwards went to Chula Vista. Although the schools 
played each other, Edwards said he never actually played against White except 
in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was weird playing against him a few years later on down the road," White 
said. "I played in the same league as Donnie and guys like J.J. Stokes. So I 
knew they were good players." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards managed his first postgame smile and said: "Well, we beat him in 
basketball in the playoffs at least." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, UCLA won't be participating in the post-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "USC is going to be our bowl game now," Edwards said. "Obviously, we're not 
going to any bowl games." 
</P>
<P>
 When reminded that the Bruins play two other games before they play USC, 
Edwards became even more serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt, first we need a win against Stanford," he said. "We need a win 
badly."

OREGON SAFETY SLIDES INTO PLACE, KEEPS OUT WASHINGTON; PACIFIC 10: WHEATON'S 
97-YARD INTERCEPTION RETURN FOR A TOUCHDOWN SEALS 31-20 UPSET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Oregon football fans, accustomed to heartbreaking losses to their powerful 
rival to the north, Saturday's 31-20 Pacific 10 upset of No. 9 Washington will 
rank among the greatest games they've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially because of how it ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon had mounted an improbable 98-yard drive to go ahead, 24-20, on Dwayne 
Jones' 12-yard run up the middle with 2:40 to play, but Washington came back to 
move the ball 67 yards to the Oregon eight. 
</P>
<P>
 On first and goal, Damon Huard dropped back to pass and lofted the ball to the 
left sideline, where redshirt freshman safety Kenny Wheaton was waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw it and the guy just sat there and read the out route and stepped in 
front of him and picked it off," Huard said. "It was a great play on his part. 
It was a tough, tough situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheaton said he'd studied the films and knew what was coming. He stepped in 
front of receiver Dave Janoski, grabbed the ball and raced 97 yards to the end 
zone with 49 seconds to play, clinching Oregon's first victory over the Huskies 
since 1988 and only the fourth in the last 21 tries. 
</P>
<P>
 The return matched the longest ever by an Oregon player. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could think of was running in here and calling my mom back home," 
Wheaton said. When he reached her at her home in Phoenix, "she was watching it 
on television, jumping up and down screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 The play climaxed a wild finish that saw Washington rally to take the lead 
with 7:44 to play, only to have Oregon, 5-3 overall and 3-1 in the Pac-10, come 
back with two late scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's Napoleon Kaufman gained 101 yards in 23 carries but had only nine 
yards in five attempts in the fourth quarter. His only long run of the day was 
for 37 yards in the first half, and he wasn't happy that Coach Jim Lambright 
decided mostly to go to the air late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always want the ball," Kaufman said. "You may call me greedy or whatever 
but I want the ball. If I have to carry the team on my shoulders, that's what I 
want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman had one long run called back by a holding penalty. The Huskies also 
saw a fumble recovery in Oregon territory nullified when they were called for 
interfering with a punt returner's ability to catch the ball. In all, 
Washington was penalized 10 times for 96 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terrible," Lambright said. "It was the sloppiest game I've seen us 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington (5-2, 2-2) trailed most of the game after Oregon scored two quick 
touchdowns early in the second quarter, one set up by Ricky Whittle's 86-yard 
kickoff return and the other by Alex Molden's interception of another sideline 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's go-ahead score came after Reggie Reser intercepted a pass by 
Danny O'Neil that bounced off Jones' hands and returned it to the Oregon 29. 
Five plays later, Richard Thomas ran 10 yards up the middle to give the Huskies 
a 20-17 lead with 7:44 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon's Troy Bailey was called for a personal foul on the play and was thrown 
out of the game, so Washington's kickoff from the 50 was high and short. 
Freshman Pat Johnson took the kick and his knee touched the turf, pinning the 
Ducks on their two. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon's longest drive up to that point was 24 yards and O'Neil had completed 
only six of 16 for 55 yards, so things looked bleak for the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 On first down, O'Neil stepped back into his end zone and fired a 36-yard pass 
to Dameron Ricketts to get the Ducks out of trouble. On the drive, he was four 
of four for 68 yards.

BOSTON COLLEGE FUMBLES AWAY CHANCE TO WIN, SETTLES FOR TIE

<TEXT>
<P>
 All Boston College had to do was hold on to the ball for one play, then kick a 
short field goal to defeat Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alcides Catanho pried the ball loose from David Green at the Rutgers 
nine-yard line and Robert Sneathen fell on it at the 12 with 22 seconds left as 
Rutgers salvaged a 7-7 tie on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even concentrate on making the tackle," Catanho said. "I just went 
straight for the arm and tried to rip the ball out." 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, Sneathen thought about scooping it up and running. "It didn't 
bounce right so I just fell on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a hard blow to the No. 22nd-ranked Eagles (3-2-1), and especially 
Green, who ran 26 times for 136 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 BC had moved from its 35 with six minutes left to a third down at the Rutgers' 
nine. Green then ran to the right to try to get better position for a field 
goal attempt on the next play and fumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutgers (4-3-1) ended the Eagles' hopes for their fourth consecutive victory.

BIG EAST ROUNDUP; MIAMI EXACTS REVENGE ON WEST VIRGINIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Costa threw for 266 yards and two touchdowns to lead No. 7 Miami to a 
38-6 victory over West Virginia on Saturday at Morgantown, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Hurricanes' 68th consecutive victory over an unranked opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa helped Miami, 5-1, 2-0 in the Big East, take a 25-0 halftime lead by 
hooking up with Chris T. Jones on a 52-yard touchdown pass play and with Yatil 
Green on a 54-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Revenge, that's the main thing we had on our minds this year," Miami 
linebacker Ray Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Hurricanes were insulted and their bus rocked as a swarm of 
Mountaineer fans celebrated a 17-14 victory, Miami's only Big East defeat. This 
year, most West Virginia fans were gone by the start of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Coach Dennis Erickson said it was easy to motivate his team. "They sat 
on that bus when it got rocked and spit on," Erickson said. "I didn't have to 
play it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's other first-half touchdowns came on a one-yard run by Danyell Ferguson 
and a nine-yarder by Larry Jones, who started in place of injured Larry 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia (3-5, 1-3) looked better and Miami sluggish for most of the 
third quarter. Then Vann Washington fumbled a punt at his seven -- West 
Virginia's fourth turnover -- and Miami's Eugene Ridgley pounced on it in the 
end zone to make it 32-0. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia has struggled to run the ball all season. It was no different 
against the Big East's top-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami held West Virginia to 23 yards rushing in 23 attempts. Robert Walker, 
who rushed for 100 yards against the Hurricanes last season, had only 10 yards 
in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 16 Syracuse 49, Temple 42 -- Marvin Harrison made a memorable visit home 
to Philadelphia, scoring three touchdowns to lead the Orangemen to a Big East 
victory over the Owls. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison caught nine passes for 191 yards, both career highs, and scored on 
pass plays of 53 and 55 yards. He also had the first touchdown run of his 
career, 20 yards on a reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Mason was the other star for Syracuse (6-1, 4-0), completing 17 of 20 
passes for 334 yards and three touchdowns. The completions, yards and 
touchdowns represented career bests for Mason, a fifth-year senior. Mason, who 
also ran five yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, led all runners with 
66 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Burris threw four touchdown passes, rallying Temple (2-5, 0-3) from a 
42-14, third-quarter deficit. His six-yard pass to Randy Canzater with three 
seconds to go cut the final margin to a touchdown. Temple has lost four in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 17 Virginia Tech 45, Pittsburgh 7 -- Antonio Freeman returned a punt 80 
yards for one touchdown, caught a touchdown pass for another and set up two 
more scores with long returns as the Hokies rolled to an easy Big East victory 
at Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Tech (7-1, 4-1) won its 10th game in a row in Lane Stadium and has 
its best record since 1967. Pitt (1-7, 0-4) lost its fifth in a row.

FORGET ROSE, LOSS LEAVES BADGERS IN PERIL OF BEING HOME ALL WINTER

 Freshman Tutu Atwell's first career touchdown reception, a 32-yarder from Tim 
Schade with 4:10 remaining, lifted Minnesota to a 17-14 upset of Wisconsin on 
Saturday, jeopardizing the Badgers' bowl hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota, 3-5 overall and 1-4 in the Big Ten, snapped a four-game losing skid 
in spoiling Wisconsin's season for the second year in a row.Minnesota handed 
the Wisconsin its lone lost last year, 28-21, in a 10-1-1 season. This time, 
the Gophers left the Badgers (3-3-1, 2-2-1) in danger of missing out on a bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin, which badly missed tailback Brent Moss, sidelined for the second 
week in a row because of an injury, must win three of its last four games to 
reach the victory level required for a bowl invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 After Atwell's touchdown, Wisconsin drove to the Minnesota 17 but cornerback 
Juan Hunter intercepted Darrell Bevell's pass with 2:41 left, preserving the 
upset.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; INDIANA'S RUN AGAINST NORTHWESTERN ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Lundy gained 174 yards and became Northwestern's career rushing leader 
in the Wildcats' 20-7 upset victory over Indiana on Saturday at Bloomington, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundy scored on a 35-yard run and set up Northwestern's first score with a 
51-yard run as the Wildcats snapped a nine-game losing streak to the Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
 He raised his career total to 2,755 yards, topping the mark of 2,643 set by 
Bob Christian from 1987-90. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern, 3-3-1 overall and 2-2 in the Big Ten, limited running back Alex 
Smith, whose 147.2 yards per average was fourth-best nationally, to 87 yards in 
23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana (5-2, 2-2) turned the ball over on fumbles twice and also failed to 
score when it had a first-and-goal on the seven-yard line in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback John Paci was thrown for a three-yard loss on first down. On the 
next play, a holding penalty nullified Paci's run into the end zone. Paci 
gained five yards on the next play, but the drive ended with two incompletions. 
</P>
<P>
 A stunned homecoming crowd saw Northwestern open a 17-7 lead in the first 
half, when Lundy gained 114 yards in 12 rushes. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Michigan 19, Illinois 14 -- Amani Toomer returned a punt 72 yards for a 
touchdown and Remy Hamilton kicked four field goals as No. 11 Michigan beat 
Illinois at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ruined the Illini's 70th anniversary celebration of Red Grange's 
six-touchdown, 212-yard performance against Michigan. The Wolverines (5-2, 3-1) 
made sure there was no second coming of the Galloping Ghost; led by linebacker 
Steve Morrison, they held Illinois (4-3, 2-2) to 40 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois was ranked second nationally on defense and hadn't allowed a 
third-quarter point this season until Michigan scored 10 in that period to take 
a 19-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Illini scored on Scott Weaver's eight-yard pass to Jason Dulick with 4:42 
to play. But with Todd Collins completing two third-down passes to Jay 
Riemersma, the Wolverines maintained possession the rest of the way. Collins 
was 17 of 25 for 177 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Toomer's game-breaking punt return came 2:28 into the second half. He caught 
the ball near the right hashmark on his 28 and got running room thanks to 
Woodrow Hankins' block of Tyrone Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone Wheatley had only 73 rushing yards for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa 19, Michigan State 14 -- Kent Kahl's second touchdown on a three-yard run 
with two minutes to play helped Iowa (3-5, 1-4) snap a five-game losing streak 
in beating Michigan State (2-5, 1-3) at Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa, using a fourth-string quarterback, stayed on the ground against the 
league's worst rushing defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Duprey, starting because of injuries to Iowa's top three quarterbacks, 
completed only three of nine passes for 33 yards with one interception. Kahl 
gained 120 yards in 16 carries, and Sedrick Shaw, who led all rushers with 137 
yards in 19 carries.

REALITY RETURNS TO PURDUE; BIG TEN: OHIO STATE EXPLOITS POOR PASS DEFENSE IN 
48-14 THUMPING OF BOILERMAKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Purdue Coach Jim Colletto heard a lot of people calling his team a contender 
in the Big Ten. But he never believed it. 
</P>
<P>
 After 24th-ranked Ohio State, 6-2 overall and 3-1 in the Big 10, administered 
a 48-14 beating Saturday, Colletto said the Boilermakers (4-2-1, 2-1-1) are 
still a long way from being among the conference's elite teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything in this game was lousy," said Colletto, a former offensive 
coordinator at Ohio State under John Cooper. "People were getting on the 
bandwagon. I know we're better than we were (last year), but I was petrified 
that what happened today might happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State moved into a tie for second in the conference, a game back of 
top-ranked Penn State, which plays host to the Buckeyes next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hoying threw four touchdown passes and had a career-high 290 passing yards 
in the first half as the Buckeyes disarmed the Boilermakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoying, who finished with 304 yards passing, tied John Borton's 42-year-old 
Ohio State record with his fifth touchdown pass on the first series of the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoying completed 19 of 23 passes in the first half and completed his only 
attempt of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I was doing today was making good decisions," Hoying said. "Early 
in the game, they were playing man-to-man defense in the secondary and not 
blitzing. You usually don't see that. And it was my job to take advantage of 
it. I got into a groove early and kept it going." 
</P>
<P>
 The 304 yards made for the fifth-highest total in Ohio State history and the 
290 yards were the most in the first half by a Buckeyes quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob passed with great confidence today. He reached his zone and that is where 
we need him to be," said Joey Galloway, who had seven catches for 95 yards and 
touchdowns of 42, two and 11 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue came in alone in second place in the Big Ten. But the Boilermakers also 
came in ranked 103rd of 107 Division I-A teams in defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared of their speed," Colletto said. "We can't play pass defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoying, who had never thrown more than two touchdown passes in a game, also 
had scoring strikes of 41 and 14 yards to Chris Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some things we're not good at -- I've known it from day one. Ohio 
State knew it too and they took care of it," Colletto said.

ATLANTIC COAST ROUNDUP; DUKE'S BLUNDER DOESN'T PREVENT SEVENTH IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So Fred Goldsmith isn't quite a genius after all. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared the first-year Duke coach had pulled a great coaching move 
Saturday when Wake Forest won the coin toss, deferred to the second half and 
the Blue Devils elected to place their stingy defense on the field first. 
</P>
<P>
 That resulted in three fumble recoveries and 21 points in the first six 
minutes as the 20th-ranked Blue Devils rolled to a 51-26 victory over the Demon 
Deacons at Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldsmith fessed up after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a little boo-boo there. I'd rather not talk about it right now," said 
Goldsmith, whose captains were supposed to take the ball first instead of 
giving it to Wake Forest. "It worked out very, very well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted the football but we scored on the first play, so I guess that is 
OK. I can't chip real well (in golf) but if one of them goes in I ain't going 
to give it back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils, 7-0 overall and 4-0 in the Atlantic Coast Conference, scored 
on the second play, after David Hawkins sacked Rusty LaRue, causing a fumble 
that was recovered in the end zone by Curtiss Brunch. 
</P>
<P>
 One play after the ensuing kickoff, Duke recovered a fumble at the Wake Forest 
23 and scored four plays later on an 11-yard pass from Spence Fischer to Jon 
Jensen. The Demon Deacons drove to the Duke 31 on the next series, but LaRue 
fumbled after being sacked by two defenders. The ball squirted to the left side 
of the pile, where John Zuanich picked it up and raced 62 yards for a 21-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really got in such a bad position, it was tough to come back," Wake Forest 
Coach Jim Caldwell said. "We were down, 21-0, before you could bat an eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Duke, with its best record since the 1941 team went 9-0 and played in the Rose 
Bowl, has put together one of the nation's best turnaround seasons, but it's 
against teams with a combined mark of 13-30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Demon Deacons (2-6, 0-5) have lost 28 in a row to ranked opponents. Five 
Wake Forest turnovers led to 34 points for Duke, which last scored 50 points in 
a 57-20 victory over Wake Forest in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Baldwin rushed for 157 yards in 28 carries for the Blue Devils, who 
play two-time defending ACC champion Florida State next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Florida State 17, Clemson 0 -- The Seminoles missed three short 
field-goal attempts but still recorded an ACC victory at Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Bentley missed two field-goal tries and was then replaced by Dan Mowrey, 
who made one of two. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seminoles (5-1, 5-0) matched an ACC record with their 21st consecutive 
league victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Clemson quarterbacks were sacked five times and the Tigers (2-5, 1-4) 
were held to 149 yards and nine first downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden not only changed kickers in the game, but 
also switched quarterbacks. Starter Danny Kanell was benched in the fourth 
quarter in favor of Jon Stark. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland 42, Georgia Tech 27 -- Scott Milanovich threw four touchdown passes 
and Maryland (3-4, 2-4) used a 21-point scoring spree in the second half to 
overwhelm the struggling Yellow Jackets (1-6, 0-5) in an ACC game at College 
Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland pulled out of a 14-14 tie with three touchdowns in an eight-minute 
span. The flurry gave the Terrapins their first victory over Georgia Tech since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Milanovich, who lost his starting job for two games before regaining it last 
week, completed 22 of 31 passes for 322 yards. It is the fifth time in his 
career that the junior threw at least four touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech played the fourth quarter without starting quarterback Tommy 
Luginbill, who suffered a mild concussion.

SOUTHEASTERN ROUNDUP; TIDE RALLIES BEHIND BARKER TO WIN, 21-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neither a 10-0 halftime deficit nor a severe lightning storm at Tuscaloosa, 
Ala., could fluster Jay Barker, who calmly rallied No. 8 Alabama to a 21-10 
victory over Mississippi on Saturday as the Crimson Tide remained in contention 
for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Barker became the winningest quarterback in Alabama history, 
improving his record to 31-1-1 in four years as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker eclipsed the record of 30 victories set by Harry Gilmer from 1944-47. 
Barker already had the best winning percentage in school history; it now stands 
at .955. Barker also extended his school-record string of passes without an 
interception to 147. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was halted for 25 minutes in the second quarter -- a rare occurrence 
in football -- because of the lightning. An Ole Miss assistant coach and two 
employees for ABC, which televised the game regionally, sustained minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tide, 8-0 overall and 5-0 in the Southeastern Conference, once again 
struggled to beat an outmanned opponent. Ole Miss is now 2-5, 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 10-7, Alabama was penalized 25 yards for holding and committing a 
personal foul on the first play of the fourth quarter. On second and 35, a pass 
interference call on the Rebels' Alundis Brices resulted in an automatic first 
down for Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after the Tide drove inside the Ole Miss one but failed to score, 
Michael Proctor kicked a 20-yard field goal to tie the game. But Brice collided 
with Proctor for a personal foul that gave the Tide first down at the one. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later from the two, Barker rolled out to his right and scored to 
give the Tide a 14-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Williams (118 yards in 32 carries), who scored Alabama's first 
touchdown on a two-yard run in the third quarter, added a three-yard scoring 
run with 16 seconds remaining after Ole Miss quarterback Josh Nelson had 
fumbled the ball away at his six with about two minutes to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia 34, Kentucky 30 -- Eric Zeier threw 55- and 28-yard touchdown passes 
to Hason Graham, and Carlos Yancy came up with an interception in the final 
minute as the Bulldogs held off the Wildcats in an SEC game at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky (1-6, 0-5), losing its fifth consecutive game, rallied from a 27-16 
deficit in the fourth quarter to go up, 30-27. 
</P>
<P>
 But Georgia (5-3, 3-3) came back on the pinpoint passing of Zeier. After Zeier 
threw to Graham for a three-yard gain, he connected on a 30-yarder to Jeff 
Thomas and completed two passes for 28 yards to Terrell Davis to the Kentucky 
28. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier, who tied his school record by completing 36 of 51 passes for 420 yards, 
then connected with Graham on a crossing pattern for the touchdown with 4:08 to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky moved the ball to the Georgia 25 on Jeff Speedy's 28-yard pass to Moe 
Williams and then called its last timeout with 55 seconds to go. On the next 
play, the snap sailed over Speedy's head. He was able to recover the ball and 
throw an incomplete pass, but the Wildcats were assessed a 21-yard penalty for 
holding. 
</P>
<P>
 Speedy then completed a 15-yard pass to the 31 to Leon Smith, who failed to 
run out of bounds to stop the clock. On the next play, Yancy intercepted a pass 
at the 15 to finish Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina 19, Vanderbilt 16 -- Reed Morton kicked four field goals, the 
last a 41-yarder that provided the difference in the Gamecocks' victory over 
the Commodores at Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt (3-4, 1-4) pulled within 19-16 on Ronnie Gordon's three-yard 
touchdown run with 3:13 left, but South Carolina (5-3, 4-2) ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina shut down the SEC's top rushing team, holding Vanderbilt to 184 
yards. The Commodores finished with 269 yards on offense.

DAVIS LEADS COUGARS OVER ARIZONA STATE; PACIFIC 10: QUARTERBACK PASSES FOR 355 
YARDS AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS IN A 28-21VICTORY.

 Chad Davis completed 28 of 40 passes for 355 yards and three touchdowns as No. 
23 Washington State withstood a late rally to beat Arizona State, 28-21, 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In bouncing back from last week's loss to Arizona, the Cougars, 5-2 overall 
and 3-1 in the Pacific 10, dominated for three quarters before Sun Devil 
quarterback Jake Plummer made it interesting with two fourth-quarter touchdown 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWayne Patterson sacked Plummer on fourth and 10 from the Cougars' 19-yard 
line with 1:23 left to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the quarter, Plummer threw touchdown passes of 32 and 12 yards 
against the nation's best defense, which entered the game having allowed no 
more than 10 points in any game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The first score, after a 15-yard punt by Martin with 9:44 left, came on 
Plummers' 32-yard pass to Clyde McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after Marcus Soward intercepted a pass by Davis and returned it to the 
Cougars' 30, Plummer trimmed the lead to seven with a 12-yard touchdown pass to 
Uumoiya Glass with 4:53 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils (2-5, 2-3) stopped the Cougars on the next possession and took 
over on the WSU 47 after a 28-yard punt by George Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Plummer hit Chris Hopkins for nine yards and Matt Nelson for 14 yards to get 
the Sun Devils to the 19, but the drive stalled after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State turned a turnover into a touchdown in the first quarter and 
then dominated the Sun Devils, holding them to 36 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars have won their last four matchups with Arizona State but trail the 
all-time series, 9-12-2.

IS CAL HAVING REFUND YET? IT'S NINE DEPOSITS, NO RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kicking (to) a team when it was down, USC's Cole Ford put foot to ball nine 
times Saturday and took his place in the annals of incidental but remarkable 
data involving 61-0 blowouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Punctuating a day when USC drop-kicked California with a first-half special 
teams ambush at the Coliseum, Ford kept reminding the Bears what kind of day it 
was as he launched kickoff after kickoff deep into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford booted nine kicks so far they could not be returned. Nine has got to be 
the NCAA record, doesn't it? No one was sure how to check. 
</P>
<P>
 First off, your team has to score enough times to make such a thing possible. 
Then, you have to go out and actually do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phenomenal, phenomenal," USC Coach John Robinson said of Ford's kick-fest. 
"He's really developed into a big-time kicker." 
</P>
<P>
 Tell it to Cal's Tyrone Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 After each USC touchdown -- there were nine -- Edwards waited helplessly in 
the end zone, received Ford's kick, took stock of his position, then handed the 
ball to an official. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards entered play as the Pacific 10 Conference's leading kick returner, 
averaging 26.2 yards per attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford figured Edwards eventually would try to return one of his kicks, no 
matter how deep, simply to spite him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he would get frustrated and say 'the hell with it,' " Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards didn't. The Trojans kept scoring and Ford kept adding punctuation 
marks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Robinson said, 'Why don't you kick one short so that the other guys can 
have some fun,' " Ford said. "He was joking." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford was given the rest of the night off after his ninth kickoff without 
return. Besides, Ford had kicked seven extra points. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove USC wasn't trying to run up the score, a reserve, Eric Rogers, 
botched USC's last two extra-point attempts and squibbed the final kickoff out 
of bounds with seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Special teams set the tone. It started when Cal kicker Ryan Longwell slipped 
on the opening approach and set the Trojans up at their 44, leading to an 
opening-drive touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the onslaught. Late in the first quarter, a 42-yard field-goal attempt 
by Longwell was blocked by Jerald Henry, who crashed through from the left 
side, and Sammy Knight. Henry scooped up the ball and outran holder Kerry 
McGonigal to the end zone for a 60-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a redeeming moment for Henry, a senior who lost his starting cornerback 
position after USC's loss to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry, obviously, took his demotion like a man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rededicated myself to doing everything I can to help us win," he said. 
"When things go wrong, you can't sit down and cry about it. You have find other 
ways to help the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry found another way in the second quarter, when he broke through again and 
blocked Longwell's 48-yard attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no stopping these special teamers. Ken Grace went 75 yards with a 
punt return to set up USC's fourth score, a four-yard scoring pass from Brad 
Otton to Terry Barnum. 
</P>
<P>
 With 3:10 left in the half, USC's Brian Haas pounced on a John Stonehouse punt 
that deflected off the leg of a Cal return man. The Trojans took over on the 
Cal 28 and scored four plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone, Stonehouse averaged 44.3 yards on four punts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Special teams were huge," Henry said. "It was the key to victory. We made 
plays to help the team totally." 
</P>
<P>
 The game already decided with USC leading by 35-0 at halftime, the only 
post-intermission drama remaining involved Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 How many unreturned kicks could he deliver in a row? 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson has always fancied himself a motivator but outdid himself this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal has a great kick returner," Robinson said. "We worked all week to make 
sure we didn't give him anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, a senior, has long awed teammates with his practice kicking exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cole has a great leg," Henry said. "He does that regularly in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry thought Ford's performance completely demoralized Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially when you get down early," Henry said of Cal. "You want the big 
play for your special teams. But when your kicker kicks keeps kicking it the 
end zone, it messes that up." 
</P>
<P>
 Safe to say, Cal was messed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford was not disappointed when Robinson sent Rogers out with the tee after USC 
made the score 61-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford could have made it a perfect 10 for 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let someone else play," he said. Ford had made his point. Nine times. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of scouts are looking for that, especially with kickoffs in the NFL (at 
the 30-yard line, instead of the 35)," Ford said. "I was perfect. I had a 
perfect day and it was a good feeling."

STENSTROM, CARDINAL GET HELP FROM BEAVERS; PACIFIC 10: THE QUARTERBACK PASSES 
FOR THREE TOUCHDOWNS; OREGON STATE COMMITS FOUR TURNOVERS.

 Stanford earned its first Pacific 10 victory Saturday against Oregon State but 
some of the credit has to go to the Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State turned over the ball four times, including two fumbles the 
Cardinal converted for touchdowns in a 35-29 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you play any team in the Pac-10, and you turn the ball over they are 
going to make you pay," said Oregon State Coach Jerry Pettibone. "And that's 
what Stanford did to us today." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom completed 19 of 32 passes for 308 yards 
and three touchdowns. He threw touchdown passes of 46 and 25 yards to Justin 
Armour in the first quarter and 17 yards to Brian Manning early in the second 
to give the Cardinal, 2-4-1 overall and 1-3 in the Pac-10, a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers (2-5, 1-4) scored on their next three possessions, evening the 
score with a one-yard touchdown run by Don Shanklin before the half that capped 
a 90-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Bookman ran 23 yards and jumped a defender in the third quarter for 
the first of his two touchdowns to put Stanford ahead to stay at 28-21, ending 
an 81-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford snapped a four-game losing streak with 486 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers, first in the Pac-10 in rushing and third nationally, racked up 
372 yards on the ground and 427 overall. J.J. Young carried 20 times for 136 
yards and three touchdowns for the Beavers. Shanklin, the Beavers' wishbone 
quarterback who had 159 yards rushing against UCLA the previous week, was held 
to 12. He also threw the first interception of his career.

SPARK-LESS MATADORS TORCHED; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NORTHRIDGE SHOWS NO FIRE IN 30-6 
LOSS TO CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO IN CONFERENCE OPENER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Better to burn out than fade away? 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge might have done both in its American West Conference 
opener on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing on turf that was singed during a pep rally bonfire at midfield earlier 
in the week, the Matadors failed to set anything ablaze and lost to Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo, 30-6, before a homecoming crowd of 4,029 at North Campus 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This won't warm the cockles of anybody's heart, either: The Matadors (3-4) 
failed to reach the end zone for the first time since 1992 and have scored all 
of one touchdown over the past two weeks, both losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got outplayed, out-coached and out-hustled," Northridge Coach Bob Burt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Factor in the black cloud hanging over Northridge's collective head because of 
looming athletic budget cuts that might jeopardize the team's future, and it 
was a bleak night. 
</P>
<P>
 A pedestrian effort seemed strangely apropos for a team that showed up with 
generic red helmets. Players peeled the Matador logos from their helmets in a 
show of unanimity over last week's student defeat of an election referendum 
that would have generated more than $2 million annually for Northridge 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that the school as a whole let the athletic department down," senior 
safety Joseph Vaughn said. "We weren't playing for the school, we were playing 
for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the misery, for the second time this season, was caused by reckless 
special-teams play. The Matadors committed two fumbles on punt returns and 
allowed a blocked punt that broke the game open. 
</P>
<P>
 On the latter, a Northridge drive stalled at the Cal Poly 45-yard line, though 
the Matadors at the moment were still very much in the game. However, Richard 
Pesti's punt was blocked by David Lombardi and recovered by David Brown, who 
returned the ball 16 yards to the Northridge 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, quarterback Mike Fisher passed to receiver Judd Davis on a 
deep slant for a touchdown to give the Mustangs a 27-6 lead with 9 minutes 57 
seconds remaining. Fisher, who passed for a school-record 409 yards a week 
earlier, completed 14 of 30 passes for 195 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The blocked punt was just one in a series of irritants for the Northridge 
offense, which crossed the 50-yard line on three of its first four 
third-quarter possessions, but couldn't cut into Cal Poly's two-touchdown lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior receiver Duc Ngo was Northridge's only notable bright spot. The 
5-foot-9 senior caught 11 passes, a single-game conference record, and also 
erased the Northridge career reception mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Ngo, who was born in Vietnam, has 111 receptions, breaking the mark of 106 set 
in 1966-67 by Dick Billingsley. The 11 catches also tied a North Campus Stadium 
record, though Ngo was despondent afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not sinking in," said Ngo, whose receptions covered 91 yards. "My 
assessment of the game is that I played very poorly. I thought we were ready 
for this game." 
</P>
<P>
 The first half was punctuated by a series of Matador bungles, including a pair 
of mishandled punt returns and a critical fumble at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 14-3, Northridge moved to the Cal Poly one-yard line on a 
well-executed, 10-play drive. On fourth down at the one, however, quarterback 
J.J. O'Laughlin dove over the top on a keeper -- but left the ball behind. A 
bad exchange with the center meant Cal Poly took over on downs at the six with 
3:21 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin completed 25 of 44 passes for 223 yards. He had one pass 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played very poorly offensively," O'Laughlin said. "We shot ourselves in 
the foot offensively. I can't speak for the defense and special teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly didn't waste any time cranking it up early. In fact, Fisher threw 
scoring passes on his first two attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 He connected with tight end David Snakenborg for a five-yard score after a 
nice bootleg, and when Northridge punted after four plays, the junior 
quarterback on first down hit tight end Tom Shaddix down the middle of the 
field for an easy 36-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 With receiver David Romines sidelined in the first quarter because of a 
strained right knee, the punt-return detail became an adventure, to say the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly's first possession of the second quarter stalled, but Northridge's 
Jonas Walker fumbled the return and William Estelle recovered at the Matador 
33. Four plays later, James Tuthill kicked a 48-yard field goal to give the 
Mustangs a 17-3 lead with 12:20 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been worse: Walker fumbled and lost another punt, this time at 
the Northridge 18, with 40 seconds left. However, cornerback Jim Rose 
intercepted a Fisher pass at the two-yard line to stop the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's scoring in the first half was limited to field goals of 31 and 22 
yards by Matt Ornelaz.

GLENDALE GIVES VENTURA PAINFUL DOSE OF REALITY, 38-6 
</P>

<P>
 The Ventura College football team has come a long way this season, but 
Saturday night, Glendale showed the Pirates just how far they still have to go 
to compete with the big boys in the Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates, who suffered through some miserable recent seasons, won four of 
their first five games this year before Glendale dominated them, 38-6, in a WSC 
North Division game at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilan Zilberman led the Vaqueros (4-2, 3-2 in conference play) by rushing for 
134 yards in 19 carries and scoring on runs of 38, three and 16 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's Tony Delgado completed 10 of 16 passes for 151 yards, and Eddie 
Michel, who played most of the second half, completed five of 14 for 133 yards, 
including a 44-yard touchdown to Tim Hilton. Kieron Estrada caught nine passes 
for 182 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the third consecutive week, the Vaquero defensive unit, ranked third 
in the WSC, did not allow a touchdown. Glendale has allowed one touchdown in 
four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's Aaron Trianna completed 13 of 26 for 185 yards, with one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 John Patton led Ventura (4-2, 3-1) with 75 yards in six carries, and Greg 
Johnson had five catches for 78 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale led at halftime, 24-6. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros took a 6-0 lead on their opening series when Zilberman broke 
loose on a 38-yard run. Mike Sierra's extra-point attempt was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 A procedure penalty at the Ventura one-yard line forced Glendale to settle for 
a field goal and Sierra's 22-yard kick put the Vaqueros ahead, 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
 After McLane Hansen's 38-yard field goal drew Ventura to within 9-3, Hilton 
took the ensuing kickoff 78 yards for a touchdown. Delgado passed to Estrada 
for the two-point conversion to make it 17-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros scored late in the half on Zilberman's three-yard run for a 24-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Hicks kicked a 43-yard field goal for Ventura as time ran out in the 
half.

HART MAKES TRACKS IN THE DESERT, 42-7

<P>
 The Hart offense rolled through the desert Saturday night, but it was the 
Indian defense that most impressed the coaching staff in a 42-7 nonleague rout 
of Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart (7-0), top-ranked in The Times' Valley poll, gave up only 54 yards in the 
first half and scored three touchdowns in the final four minutes of the second 
quarter to build a 35-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Palm Springs (3-4) scored on a 96-yard kickoff return by Bishop Miller, 
cutting Hart's lead to 21-7. It was the only time Palm Springs was able to use 
its speed effectively against a bigger, more physical Hart team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned about their speed, because last week against Canyon we were 
horrible on defense," Hart Coach Mike Herrington said. "We were inept on 
defense, so we worked harder this week." 
</P>
<P>
 While the defense held Palm Springs to 180 yards, Hart rolled up 447 yards 
behind the passing of Steve McKeon and the running of Ted Iacenda. Iacenda 
rushed for 172 yards in 16 carries and scored three times in the first half on 
runs of one yard, 62 yards and one yard. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon completed 10 of 18 passes for 188 yards. His first completion of the 
night was a 33-yard scoring play to Domenic Dillillo, giving Hart a 14-0 lead 
in the first quarter.

THOUSAND OAKS SWEEPS MT. SAC INVITATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After coughing and sputtering for the first half of the season, the Thousand 
Oaks High boys' cross-country team shifted into high gear Saturday in the Mt. 
San Antonio College Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers resembled last year's undefeated squad for the first time while 
running away with their third straight team sweepstakes title. Thousand Oaks 
also won the girls' team sweepstakes easily. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' team, led by Keith O'Doherty's third-place finish, placed five 
runners among the top 16 to total 49 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmichael Jesuit, the top-ranked Division II team in the state, placed second 
with 149 points, followed by Peninsula (167), Camarillo (170), San Jose 
Bellarmine (185) and Hart (189). 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks was the No. 5-ranked team in The Harrier magazine's national 
poll entering the meet, but early season injuries to Jeff Fischer and Kevin 
Marsden had prevented the Lancers from being the dominant team of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Doherty timed 15 minutes 14 seconds over the three-mile course and fellow 
seniors Marsden and Fischer finished eighth and ninth with identical times of 
15:41. 
</P>
<P>
 Add juniors Todd Disney (13th in 15:47) and Josh Carolan (16th in 15:56) to 
the equation and Thousand Oaks produced a team time of 78:19, the 
second-fastest ever by a Southern Section school at Mt. SAC. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers set the course team time record of 77:56 to win last year's 
Southern Section Division I title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did we run well or what?" Thousand Oaks Coach Jack Farrell said. "I think 
that's about as well as we can run right now." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Doherty, Eleazar Hernandez of Camarillo, Antonio Arce of Palmdale and Brett 
Strahan of Hart staged a spirited battle for the individual title. 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan lead the field through the first mile in 4:49 before opening a 
10-meter lead going up the first hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, Arce and O'Doherty reeled in Strahan, however, and when Arce surged 
up aptly named "poop-out" hill just before two miles, Strahan quickly fell off 
the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to try and get them in the hills because my (finishing speed) is 
not that good right now," Arce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hernandez trailed Arce and O'Doherty by five meters, he pulled even 
with them as they began their ascent up the final hill and surged to victory 
after cresting the peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez's time of 15:02 cut 25 seconds from his previous best on the Mt. SAC 
course. Arce finished second in 15:09. 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan, who out-kicked Hernandez to win last month's Mt. Carmel Invitational, 
was fourth in 15:21. 
</P>
<P>
 "My plan was to go hard on that last hill," Hernandez said. "I didn't worry 
when (Strahan) took the early lead. I just wanted to run with the leaders and 
relax." 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' team sweepstakes was billed as a showdown between Thousand Oaks and 
defending State Division I champion Irvine, but the Lancers dominated the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, led by Kim Mortensen's winning time of 18:24, placed five 
runners among the top 25 for a 65-point total. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills was second with 172, followed by El Toro (173), Irvine (181) and 
Buchanan (184). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what to make of today," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reason, we were the only team that had five solid runners. Most 
of the other teams' fourth and fifth runners were way back." 
</P>
<P>
 In other races, Amy Skieresz of Agoura suffered her first loss of the season 
-- finishing third (18:56) -- in the girls' individual sweepstakes and Phil 
Gonzalez of Crescenta Valley and John Greene of Agoura placed third (15:25) and 
fourth (15:27) in the boys' individual sweepstakes.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / STEVE HENSON: CRESPI GETS SOME LUCK OF THE CELTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE HENSON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lins called the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins threw the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins caught the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 And as easy as one, two, three, Crespi High toppled St. Paul, the No. 9-ranked 
team in the state, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi Coach Tim Lins called for a quick sideline pass on fourth and one from 
the St. Paul 12-yard line with 28 seconds to play and Crespi trailing, 13-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi quarterback Dave Lins fired the pass directly into the upraised hand of 
a St. Paul defensive end. The ball caromed high into the air, and landed in the 
lap of . . . Lins! The quarterback, not the coach, who incidentally is not 
related to the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about throwing it again," said Lins, who instead dashed three yards 
for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi hurried to the ball and Lins, the quarterback, coolly . . . fumbled the 
snap. Crespi again hurried to the ball and Lins stopped the clock by throwing 
an incomplete pass with eight seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins, the coach, called a slant pass to Marcos Solorzano. Lins, the 
quarterback, hit him in the stomach with a touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Boskin kicked the extra point to give Crespi the victory, making every 
Lins in attendance very happy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Tim Lins: The victory was doubly sweet for the coach, a St. Paul alumnus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach is a mellow guy and he didn't make a big deal out of it, but he told us 
he wasn't used to losing (when he was playing) at St. Paul," Dave Lins said. "I 
guess they always won when he was in school there." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Paul was 22-3 in 1977-78, when Lins was a Swordsman wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celts are 2-0 in Del Rey League play after going 2-3 in nonleague games, 
and are poised to make the Division I playoffs with another victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season Crespi started slowly, squeezed into the playoffs and reached the 
semifinals before losing to Eisenhower, 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Dave Lins: The 6-foot-2, 185-pound senior is the area's leading Southern 
Section passer, having completed a remarkable 69.6% of his throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins completed 21 of 24 for 164 yards against St. Paul and is 134 of 193 for 
1,396 yards and 11 touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and he has one reception. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U-turn: The low came a month ago in a 14-13 loss to Newbury Park, Agoura's 
fourth defeat without a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when we got beat by a girl," said Charger quarterback Eric Fitzgerald, 
referring to Chrissy Sanford's winning field goal on the last play. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody cracked, nobody panicked, and the long wait to give rookie Coach 
Charlie Wegher his first victory came the next week, 35-13 over Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic victories over Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley have followed, and 
suddenly Agoura finds itself 3-1 in Marmonte League play and tied for second 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept the faith. Coach Wegher kept telling us we had to believe," said Ryan 
Capretta, who caught two touchdown passes Friday in a 22-20 victory over 
previously unbeaten Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura's rebound is remarkable considering that both starting offensive 
tackles, 6-6, 300-pound Elliot Silvers and 6-foot, 235-pound Keith Ostwald, are 
out with injuries. Wegher patched up the line by moving fullback Jon Gibbs to 
guard.  
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hicks moved from guard to tackle and Scott McKinney, a 6-3, 270-pound 
senior, has filled on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we didn't have immediate success, I had to take a close look at what we 
were doing," Wegher said. "But I determined that what we were doing eventually 
would work, and the kids have believed in it. That's the key." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 308 A.D.: It took 25 years, but Larry Logan made it look easy on his first 
try. In his initial start as the San Fernando quarterback, the 5-11 junior 
broke the school record for passing yardage in a game by throwing for 308 in a 
42-28 victory over Birmingham on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Davis set the previous record of 289 against Hollywood in 1969. Davis, 
who went on to star at USC, holds nearly all of San Fernando's career passing 
and rushing records. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan, whose father, Larry, played defensive tackle for San Fernando in 
1974-75, also set a record for best completion percentage in a game, 63.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect records, but Larry has the type of athletic ability that can 
make him a excellent quarterback," said Sean Blunt, the San Fernando coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan replaced Keijuan Douglas, who moved to receiver. Logan connected with 
Douglas for a 15-yard touchdown to open the scoring and later teamed with him 
on a 50-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas also made an interception in the end zone. "Keijuan showed me a lot, 
putting his feelings aside and doing what was best for the team," Blunt said.

OAK TREE AT SANTA ANITA; BERTRANDO TO BE SUPPLEMENTED TO BREEDERS' CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bertrando will be supplemented to the Breeders' Cup for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-owners Ed Nahem and Marshall Naify will put up $360,000 to run the 
5-year-old Skywalker horse in the Breeders' Cup Classic for the second 
consecutive year. Bertrando was second to Arcangues in last year's Classic and, 
before that, was second to Arazi in the 1991 Juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first payment has already been met," Nahem said. "It's a lot of money, 
but we think we can win it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race here (the $250,000 California Cup Classic on Saturday) isn't that 
much easier. It's fair to say that's one reason we decided to go to (Churchill 
Downs). But again, the main thing is we think we can win the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens will ride Bertrando, who won the Goodwood Handicap eight days 
ago, in the Classic. The California-bred is scheduled to work six furlongs at 
Hollywood Park either today or Monday and will ship to Kentucky on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Able to win only six races the first 14 days of the Oak Tree meeting, Chris 
Antley came up with four victories Saturday, including a wire-to-wire score 
aboard 9-2 shot Newton's Law in the $82,500 Henry P. Russell Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Antley replaced Corey Nakatani, who was sidelined for the second consecutive 
day after being thrown during a Friday morning work, on Newton's Law. Antley 
slowed the pace, then had enough left to beat 17-1 shot Stark South by a 
half-length in 2:01 3/5 for the 1 1/4 miles on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive victory for the 4-year-old Law Society colt, who 
had gone winless in his first seven U.S. starts after arriving from France. 
</P>
<P>
 Seahawk Gold was third, 1 1/2 lengths behind Stark South, and he finished a 
bit more than two lengths in front of Inner City, the 7-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a bad pick-up ride, eh?" said Antley, who also won the first on Rosky, 
the fifth on Ferrara and the ninth on What A Spell. "Maybe he didn't get a 
whole lot of faith coming in because in threw in that one bad race in his start 
before last (finishing eighth of nine on Aug. 15 at Del Mar). 
</P>
<P>
 "But it looks like he's just coming around. His last race was super and he ran 
the same race back. He did get a comfortable enough lead. I asked him a little 
bit leaving the gate, then he got to running. I coasted on him until he was 
challenged. He dug in when challenged and wouldn't let (Stark South) by him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux, who rode the favorite, said his horse was fine until the 
field hit the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The track was nice and firm, like going over I-10, but it changes about 70 
yards before the eighth pole," Desormeaux said. "It turns into an absolute bog. 
It's yielding. I thought I was going to win by 10, but when we hit the bog, he 
fell apart. He just wouldn't quicken again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous, who has been more hype than performance for most of his career, is 
the 5-2 favorite against eight other 3-year-olds in the $110,800 Volante 
Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on the turf today at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth in the Del Mar Derby, but moved up to fourth after the disqualification 
of Eagle Eyed, Numerous, a $1.7-million yearling, has won three of nine starts, 
but only one stakes. He beat a weak field in the Derby Trial on April 30 at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron will ride the Mr. Prospector colt, who has a victory and the 
fourth in the Del Mar Derby in two grass starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Powis Castle, who apparently didn't care for the track at Woodbine, where he 
was sixth in the Molson Million, is the 4-1 second choice. The Rare Brick colt 
won a division of the Oceanside Stakes at Del Mar and was moved up to third by 
the stewards in the Del Mar Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 The others in the field are Set On Cruise, the upset winner of the Pomona 
Derby; Blue King, who won two of nine while racing in France; Run Softly, 
Marvin's Faith; Turbo Fan, who will race coupled with Blue King; Jacques Aboard 
and Alphabet Soup. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Re Toss, who upset Paseana in the 1993 Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park and 
was third in last year's Breeders' Cup Distaff, has been retired. The 
7-year-old will serve as a broodmare at Taylor Made Farm in Lexington. She 
finished her career with earnings of $907,536 and won nine of 42 starts. . . . 
For the second time in three weeks, there was only one winning ticket in the 
National Best Seven. It paid $116,138.70. Only one favorite -- Sadies Dream in 
the Best of Ohio Distaff at Beulah Park -- won during the sequence.

RECREATION / STEVE HENSON: GUIDED TOUR THROUGH STATE PARK A NATURAL FOR 
FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly all that interests a 4-year-old boy and 3-year-old twin girls is right 
there in Topanga State Park on a clear autumn morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything else is in Teri Giacaloni's soiled red backpack. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri is a volunteer docent who conducts nursery nature walks twice a month. 
Kids ages 6 and under, along with a parent, meet at the park with a snack and 
an appetite for discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 My son Daniel and twin daughters Gina and Angela joined Teri, her 3-year old 
daughter and seven other kids this week on a two-hour walk. My wife Diane and I 
tried to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there was a breeze. The park is seven miles from Ventura Boulevard, 
although upon arrival the congested San Fernando Valley may as well be a 
continent away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at someone else's house even though we are outside," Teri, 38, says as 
the walk begins. "Lots of animals live here." 
</P>
<P>
 Signs warning of poison oak and rattlesnakes mark the beginning of the trail, 
which makes a long circle around the top of the park. First stop is a 
soil-filled tray with molds of animal tracks: raccoon, bobcat, cougar, coyote 
and fawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we'll see some of these tracks along the trail," Teri says. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel's eyes gleam. "I want to see a mountain lion, Dad," he says before 
running to catch up with our guide, whom he clearly has determined knows 
everything that is important on this day. 
</P>
<P>
 We walk uphill, making use of a natural staircase formed by oak roots in the 
trail.  
</P>
<P>
 Angela must be prodded because she squats every few yards, scanning the trail 
and digging her fingers into the ground. She is mesmerized by the tiniest oak 
leaf, holding it before her eyes with both hands. 
</P>
<P>
 We examine animal droppings. Scat flecked with red indicates a coyote has been 
eating berries. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing the theme during a break under a shady tree, Teri lifts a book from 
her backpack titled "Everybody Poops," and begins reading to the kids while 
they eat their snacks. Their appetites are unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
 The backpack is a treasure chest of natural wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri pulls out and passes around pieces of honeycomb, a glass container 
stuffed with three large, dead bumblebees, a Chumash Indian scraping tool, 
pieces of wool and cotton, and a variety of herbs natural to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Three bird nests are next, and the kids feel how the soft interior contrasts 
with the prickly exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 One is lined with cellophane wrappers from cigarette packages. Another is 
filled with minute skeletons of baby birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri begins reading a second book, this one about a worm named Squiggly, when 
a large doe crashes through the brush about 30 yards in front of the group. I 
quickly lift Gina above my head and she catches a glimpse of the deer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't she cuuuute ," Gina says. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, the rest of the deer family -- a buck and two fawns -- dash 
past our group, then sprint across a rye field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible they came so close to us when we were being so loud," one of 
the parents says. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the trail a breathtaking view unfolds. The ocean is visible over 
Pacific Palisades and the rejuvenated hills after last year's fires are a 
pleasing sight. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way down, Gina asks to be carried.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the kids -- Daniel and Angela included -- make the entire walk, but a 
few end up with their arms draped around Mom or Dad's neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri points out bugs eating the bark of a hollow tree, and Gina perks up, 
squirming out of my arms and into the tree. Insects are her passion; she spends 
hours scouring our back yard for "roly polys." 
</P>
<P>
 Other hollow trees hold different mysteries.  
</P>
<P>
 One is full of dry honeycombs. Another is climbed through by everyone shorter 
than 4 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 After sidestepping more droppings, Teri mentions that coyotes are important 
because without them we would be overrun with field mice and rats.  
</P>
<P>
 Diane shoots me a wry smile; we hear packs of coyotes howling late at night 
from our Thousand Oaks bedroom, and she fears them attacking our dog. 
</P>
<P>
 The final adventure for the kids is a fence covered with lizards. "Catch a 
wizard!" exclaims one boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The wizard here has been Teri, who made a simple walk around a state park an 
instructive and memorable experience for children.  
</P>
<P>
 Pockets of the natural world are all around us, and we all should take the 
time to take it in. 
</P>
<P>
 And just as Teri predicted, by the time we leave the canyon our kids are 
asleep in their car seats, dreaming of deer dancing across a meadow.

MOORPARK GOES FOR TWO, COMES UP SHORT BY ONE

<P>
 Trailing by 14 points at halftime and all the momentum on the side of 
upset-minded Bishop Diego High, Moorpark came swarming back Saturday only to be 
denied, 21-20, and suffered its first loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 With just over two minutes to play, senior running back Bryan Wilkins brought 
the Musketeers (6-1) to within one point on a five-yard run, set up by the 
first of two blocked punts by Quan Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rob Dearborn decided to go for the victory, and on a sweep to the left 
Wilkins was stopped by five red jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to go for two," Dearborn said. "It's a nonleague game. We had to go 
for the win." 
</P>
<P>
 After Nguyen's second blocked punt with 50 seconds remaining, Moorpark started 
on the Bishop Diego 37-yard line and drove to the five. However, when Wilkins 
failed to get out of bounds after catching a pass from Bryan Paul with eight 
seconds left and no timeouts remaining, the Musketeers couldn't get the field 
goal unit on the field . 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark scored both of its comeback touchdowns in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to play four quarters, not just one, to win a football game, " 
Dearborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins led the comeback, carrying 26 times for 151 yards and a touchdown, and 
also threw to wide receiver David Burns for a 29-yard touchdown on a halfback 
option pass with 4:13 remaining to make it 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul finished 12 of 17 for 107 yards and a 28-yard touchdown to Tyler Dritz 
midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel Sanchez carried 21 times for 144 yards and a touchdown for Bishop 
Diego (2-5). Sanchez also had a 96-yard interception return for a touchdown as 
time expired in the first half to give the Cardinals a 21-7 lead.

HARVARD RUSHES FOR 27-12 WIN; FOOTBALL: DEMARTINIS GAINS 89 YARDS AND SCORES 
TOUCHDOWN AS WOLVERINES DEFEAT VERBUM DEI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Merlin DeMartinis had a pair of healthy shoulders. And he used them to carry 
Harvard-Westlake High to a 27-12 Camino Real League victory over Verbum Dei on 
Saturday at Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMartinis, replacing injured tailback Abed Abusaleh, rushed for a season-high 
89 yards and one touchdown in 18 carries to lead Harvard (5-1-1, 2-0). The 
6-foot-1, 195-pound DeMartinis, a junior defensive back and backup quarterback, 
had logged only 14 carries through six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was different," DeMartinis said of his role. "A couple of games, I got in 
a little bit. But being the backup quarterback, I pretty much knew the plays we 
were going to run." 
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious early that Abusaleh would not be shouldering the load as he has 
done all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Abusaleh, the team's leading rusher with 385 yards and five touchdowns, headed 
for the bench during the Wolverines' second drive, his right arm hanging limp 
and his face contorted in pain. Abusaleh, who has been nursing a bruised 
shoulder since the season's first week, did not return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing Abed so early was tough," Harvard Coach Dave Bennett said. "I try to 
give Merlin a lot of (practice) as backup quarterback so he doesn't get a lot 
of (practice) at running back. My ready list -- which isn't very big to begin 
with -- was cut in half." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 6-0, early in the second quarter, Harvard marched 72 yards to take a 
7-6 lead on a nine-yard pass from Derek Lemkin to Kevin Goldfein. 
</P>
<P>
 Two minutes later, Harvard went ahead for good when Charu Turner recovered a 
bad snap in the end zone while Verbum Dei (5-2, 0-1) was attempting to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard followed with a surprise onside kick and Spencer Hudnut recovered at 
the Verbum Dei 42-yard line. Six plays later, De Martinis swept one yard for a 
touchdown. DeMartinis also had runs of 12, 10 and seven yards on the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard scored again 30 seconds before halftime on a 27-yard field goal by 
Greg Nortman. 
</P>
<P>
 Nortman added a 42-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter to put the game 
out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nortman is becoming a real weapon for us," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMartinis was even more valuable, playing nearly every down despite having 
his bell rung during a collision on Verbum Dei's final touchdown drive late in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great," DeMartinis said. "It's just everything is a little hazy."

CAL LUTHERAN SNAPS LOSING STREAK WITH 43-14 ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

<P>
 It's all over for the Cal Lutheran football team. 
</P>
<P>
 The losing streak, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen played their most-complete game of the season on Saturday night, 
beating Azusa Pacific, 43-14, in a nonconference game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (2-4) had lost four consecutive games since winning its opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed a big win in a big way," said defensive back Chad Valousky, who had 
three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will help our egos a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The medicine for Cal Lutheran's problems was NAIA Azusa, which dropped to 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally got to see the other end of the spectrum," Cal Lutheran Coach Joe 
Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran scored early, often and unconventionally. The Kingsmen scored 
points on offense, defense and special teams. They even scored on a safety when 
Azusa, set to punt from its end zone, snapped the ball through the uprights. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsmen tailback Terrence Thomas gained 158 yards in 27 carries. It was his 
second consecutive 100-yard performance and fourth of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran quarterback Ryan Huisenga completed 11 of 23 passes for 206 yards 
and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver Tom Herman caught three passes for 103 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The defensive star for Cal Lutheran was Valousky, whose three interceptions 
included a 55-yard touchdown return. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was wild from the start. Azusa attempted a punt from its 24 on its 
first possession, but the snap eluded Carl Martinez and rolled into the end 
zone, where Cal Lutheran's Johnny Davis fell on the ball for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa tied the game on a one-yard run by Marcus Slaten on the Cougars' next 
possession, but Cal Lutheran came right back with an 11-yard score by Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 12 minutes into the game, the Kingsmen scored 14 points, which was a 
point more than they had managed in their past two games combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran then pulled away with Valousky's score on an interception return. 
Valousky has both of Cal Lutheran's defensive touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars then added the most unusual score of the first half. Quarterback 
Ben Focke's pass hit the hands of Cal Lutheran defensive back James Mason and 
bounced into the hands of Jeff Atherton, who scored on the 58-yard play The 
score pulled Azusa within 21-14 with 6 minutes 23 seconds to play in the second 
quarter, but the Cougars could get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran took a 35-14 halftime lead on pair of identical play-action 
passes.

VALLEY UP TO SPEED AFTER SLOW 1ST HALF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before his football team's game against Harbor College on Saturday afternoon, 
Valley Coach Jim Fenwick was genuinely concerned about a letdown. After all, it 
was a case of teams headed in opposite directions -- Valley was undefeated and 
on the rise, Harbor winless and heading nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the first half, Fenwick's fears appeared justified. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs, ranked 10th in the nation by the J.C. Grid-Wire, struggled early 
before pulling away for a 45-17 victory over their outclassed opponent in a 
Western State Conference Southern Division game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were ready, but we were also very respectful of Harbor," Fenwick said. 
"They're (an 0-7 team), but they're much better than that. It was also an 
afternoon game, and they're used to it and we're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley (7-0) also might have been looking ahead to its next game against 
powerful Bakersfield. Whatever the reason, the Monarchs appeared to play 
cautiously against the lightly regarded Seahawks for most of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs clung to a 10-3 lead until running back Johnnie Brown broke loose 
for 48-yard touchdown run with 1 minute 39 seconds remaining in the second 
quarter. Then holder Steve Comer made the best of a bad snap from center, 
running it in for a two-point conversion and an 18-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The game still appeared in doubt late in the third quarter when Harbor drove 
76 yards to the Valley 15. But defensive back Doug Socha intercepted a pass in 
the flat by Harbor quarterback Kenji Tatum and returned it a school-record 93 
yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor was also the opponent when Bob Fries established the previous record of 
76 yards in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 For all intents, that was more than enough points against the turnover-plagued 
Seahawks. But Valley took advantage of two more turnovers to open a 38-3 
cushion after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lopsided margin of victory, the Monarchs managed only a 338-327 
advantage in total yards. The difference was a Valley defense that forced six 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the sign of a good team when you get those type of opportunities and 
turn them into points," Fenwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley was led by quarterback Jim Arellanes, who completed 17 of 28 passes for 
201 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions. He spread his passes 
among eight players, including receiver Cameron Perry and running back Deriek 
Charles with four each. 
</P>
<P>
 Comer, the leading receiver in the WSC, had three catches for 66 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such a good receiver that a lot of people are double-covering him," 
Arellanes said. "But we've got a lot of guys we can spread the ball around to 
on this team."

MOORPARK DOES JUST ENOUGH FOR VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a case of just enough oomph to win for Moorpark College and missed 
opportunities for Pierce in their football game Saturday night, but a little 
bit of something is better than a whole lot of nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way Moorpark must look at its 26-20 victory in a Western State 
Conference game that opened North Division play for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorpark (4-2, 4-1) did just enough things well, and was aided by several 
Pierce mistakes and misfires to start its challenge for a third consecutive 
divisional title. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore quarterback Damian Delfino completed 13 of 17 passes for 227 yards 
and two touchdowns, both to receiver Isaiah Mustafa, and running back Gary 
Clemons led all rushers with 138 yards and a touchdown in 26 carries.

<P>
 Pierce (1-5, 1-4), in its first season in the North Division after switching 
from the South in a realignment of the conference, had plenty of chances to 
win, but failed to capitalize despite a marvelous effort by quarterback David 
Muir. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir completed 28 of 53 passes for 333 yards and two touchdowns, but the 
Brahmas broke down on offense in several key situations. 
</P>
<P>
 There were, for instance, missed field-goal attempts of 39 and 25 yards by 
Doug Sidwell. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Brahmas wasted a 71-yard kickoff return by Ron McKelvey to the 
Moorpark 24 midway through the fourth quarter with the Raiders ahead, 26-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce could not advance past the Moorpark 19 on the possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams scored on their first possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 After the opening kickoff, the Raiders drove 73 yards in four plays -- and 
only 34 seconds -- to take a 7-0 lead on a 14-yard run up the middle by 
Clemons. 
</P>
<P>
 The two key plays in the drive were a 22-yard pass from Delfino to Mustafa on 
the first play of the game and a 35-yard run by Fred Polito on second and eight 
from the Pierce 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce responded on the ensuing possession, although the Brahmas were aided by 
a personal foul against Moorpark on fourth and 10 from their 28. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first play after the penalty, Muir found wide receiver Rodney Williams 
open in the left flat for a 57-yard touchdown that tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 A field goal by Steve Sabbe midway through the quarter gave Moorpark a 10-7 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders then capitalized on a huge Pierce mistake with 28 seconds 
remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 On first down from the Brahma 23, Muir rolled left and fumbled while being 
sacked by David Acosta.  
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Flores recovered and returned the ball to the Pierce one. The Brahmas 
held, however, and Moorpark settled for a 20-yard field goal by Sabbe with four 
seconds left before the half.

 Bongkuk Pak's 18-yard touchdown pass to Danny Quinal with 46 seconds remaining 
and Xavier Acosta's conversion kick propelled College of the Desert to a 21-20 
Foothill Conference victory over Antelope Valley on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 If Antelope Valley could find any consolation, it was in an offense that put 
together sustained scoring drives. The Antelopes (1-6, 1-4 in conference play), 
who had only two scoring drives of any length all season, marched 76, 80 and 55 
yards for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley took a 20-7 lead through three quarters on a 13-yard pass from 
Mike Gleich to Chris Brown and one-yard runs by Roosevelt Miller and Domino 
Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller led all rushers with 129 yards in 21 carries.

CHAPMAN CRUISES ON, 62-0, BEATING TROUBLED MENLO; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: PANTHERS 
RECOVER FROM FIRST LOSS LAST WEEK AND IMPROVE TO 4-1-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacob Galasso found a good night to play quarterback for Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, facing an overmatched and troubled team from Menlo College, took 
a 62-0 victory in front of 2,822 Saturday night at Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 Galasso, a freshman who started the season as a third-string quarterback and 
reserve tailback, never had occasion to get the jitters. Chapman scored on its 
first three possessions and five of the six times it had the ball in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally think I could have done better," Galasso said. "There were some 
skill things I talked with my coach about improving, but as a team, we didn't 
allow a sack, we only had two penalties. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Galasso, who completed five of 15 passes for 120 yards and a touchdown, didn't 
have to mention all the touchdowns. That part was obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman (4-1-1) took a 34-0 halftime lead and extended it to 55-0 before the 
third quarter was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Menlo (1-6) put up a decent fight considering it had only 32 players available 
for the game. The Oaks gained only 32 fewer yards in total offense than 
Chapman, but it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 They were missing five players, including three defensive starters, because of 
disciplinary action after a brawl in the final seconds of their game last week 
at Claremont-Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, which lost the first time last week against Occidental, wasn't 
sympathetic. The Panthers revved up their big-play machine, and every time they 
snapped the ball they were a threat to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Four times Chapman scored on the first play of a possession, once on the 
second play and another time on the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that two interception returns for touchdowns and you have an easy night 
to be a Chapman quarterback . . . or coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just too hard on them to lose those players and have the morale 
problems they probably had this week," Chapman Coach Ken Visser said. "We had a 
little too much team speed for them, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman asserted its speed advantage all over the field. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tailback Darnell Morgan scored on touchdown runs of 35 and 64 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Darnell Rubin, wide receiver/kick returner/running back, scored on a 
39-yard pass from receiver Terrance Green and an 85-yard run that was the 
Panthers' longest play from scrimmage this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Green got behind the secondary to catch a 34-yard scoring pass from Galasso 
to give the Panthers their 34-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Linebacker Michael Simmons returned an interception 39 yards for a 
touchdown in the first half and Malcolm King returned one 77 yards for a score 
on the first play of the fourth quarter to make it 62-0. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't even matter if the plays weren't run as diagramed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman padded a 3-0 lead after getting the ball at the Menlo 35 when Simmons 
intercepted a pass. On the first play, Morgan had to chase down the ball when 
Galasso's pitch went over his head. But Morgan scrambled back and picked up the 
ball at the Menlo 47, eluded several defensive linemen and ran untouched into 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, Green took a reverse handoff, slipped, recovered his balance and 
threw to a wide-open Rubin for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman led, 3-0, after Bill Hamlin's 45-yard field goal. Hamlin also made a 
47-yard field goal, his longest of the season and thought to be a Chapman 
record.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; L.A. BAPTIST SNEAKS PAST MARANATHA, 7-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adrian Kaali-Nagy's 29-yard touchdown reception and subsequent conversion kick 
midway through the fourth quarter lifted L.A. Baptist High to a 7-6 victory 
over Maranatha in an Alpha League game Saturday night at San Marino High. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior running back Surfy Taylor, who rushed for 237 yards in 31 carries, gave 
Maranatha a 6-0 lead on a four-yard run early in the second quarter. Taylor, 
also a defensive back, had 14 tackles and forced a fumble that the Minutemen 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Ross gained 147 yards in 16 carries for L.A. Baptist (2-5, 2-0 in 
league) and quarterback Robin Woo completed seven of 12 passes for 56 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Maranatha (3-3, 1-1) was forced to play without three starters as quarterback 
Nathan Covey, running back Jordan McMahon and defensive back Darryl Ussery and 
were involved in a automobile accident heading to the game after the team 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell-Jeff 39, St. Genevieve 13 -- The Guards controlled the line of scrimmage, 
rushing 29 times for 256 yards and four touchdowns, dropping the visiting 
Valiants to 0-7 and 0-4 in Santa Fe League play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guards (4-3, 3-1) scored on runs of eight, 13, 16 and two yards. Danny 
Hughes rushed eight times for 72 yards, and sophomore Tommy Gales had 49 yards 
on five carries, including a two-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
 David Matekel had touchdown receptions of 19 and 24 yards to lead the Guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Richard Szeptycki completed five of seven passes for 94 yards and 
two touchdowns to Matekel. A Szeptycki pass was picked off by Eric Tapia, who 
returned it 85 yards for a touchdown to make the score 26-13 in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapia also had four catches for 49 yards, including a 15-yard touchdown that 
gave the Valiants their only lead of the evening, 7-6, in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Pisano completed six of 16 pass attempts for 79 yards for the Valiants. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilpatrick 34, Western Christian 7 -- Mario Qualls did a little of everything 
and led the visiting Mustangs (5-2, 1-1) to an Alpha League victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualls had two pass receptions for 34 yards, rushed 13 times for 78 yards -- 
including touchdown runs of 46 and four yards -- and returned a punt 62 yards 
for his third score to fuel a 28-0 Kilpatrick lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustang defense limited the Lancers (2-5, 0-2) to 93 yards of total 
offense, forcing 6 turnovers. Wardell Joe, Cleo Cloman, Edward Lyde and Levell 
Ziegler all had interceptions for Kilpatrick. Cloman's and Lyde's interceptions 
were returned for touchdowns.

VALLEY CHRISTIAN IMPROVES TO 6-1 AGAINST HOBBLED CALVARY CHAPEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the start of the season, those in the know thought the winner of Saturday's 
Calvary Chapel-Cerritos Valley Christian game would have the inside track for 
the Olympic League title. 
</P>
<P>
 They were right.While the injury-plagued Eagles have struggled, Valley 
Christian, ranked second in Division X, improved to 6-1 with a 21-0 victory at 
Newport Harbor High. The Crusaders (2-0 in league) are tied with Orange 
Lutheran for the league lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (3-4) managed only 131 yards and crossed the 50-yard line only 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the trouble was the situation at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Echan, normally a running back, started in place of Waylan Kruse, who is 
recovering from a sprained ankle. Dallas Kruse, Waylan's younger brother, also 
took a turn as the Eagles changed quarterbacks nine times, rotating three 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're scrambling a bit because of our injury situation," Eagle Coach Kris Van 
Hook said. "Waylan was hobbling a little bit and so we started Mark, but we 
brought Waylan in early to try to establish the passing game. 
</P>
<P>
 Waylan Kruse completed six of 10 passes for 95 yards in the game. ERIC MADDY

PREP FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; SANTA ANA WINS ITS FIRST OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An interception by Carlos Rodriguez halted a potential game-winning drive by 
winless Tustin as host Santa Ana earned its first victory of the season in a 
9-3 Golden West League game Saturday night at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big victory for us because it puts us back in the hunt for the 
playoffs," Santa Ana Coach Bob Hinman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez picked off a pass by Tustin quarterback Kevin Timone at the Santa 
Ana 29 with 2 minutes 27 seconds remaining to secure the victory for the Saints 
(1-6, 1-1). Tustin (0-7, 0-2) has lost 13 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Esparza's one-yard touchdown run with 11:15 left in the second quarter 
was enough for Santa Ana, which also scored a safety late in the fourth 
quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 Tustin, which blew scoring opportunities with four turnovers, took the early 
lead on a 26-yard field goal by Adam Thomasson on its opening drive.  
</P>
<P>
 The Tillers compiled 172 yards in offense to 212 for Santa Ana, which won 
despite being assessed 105 yards in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Arrowhead League game: 
</P>
<P>
 Anza Hamilton 25, Southern California Christian 0 -- Rocky Meyers ran for 164 
yards and four touchdowns to lead host Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton (5-1, 2-0) recorded its fifth shutout of the season, holding the 
Flames to 28 yards total offense, including three yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flames (1-6, 0-2) held the Bobcats in check the first quarter, holding 
Meyers to 24 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Meyers put the Bobcats on the scoreboard with 5:43 left in the second 
quarter, scoring on a two-yard run for a 6-0 lead. The touchdown capped a 
14-play, 69-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers' second touchdown came on a four-yard run with 34 seconds left in the 
half. The score, which gave Hamilton a 12-0 halftime lead, was set up by a 
51-yard completion from quarterback Erik Contreras to Donny Bonga. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bobcats wasted no time scoring in the third quarter. Meyers scored on a 
15-yard run on Hamilton's opening drive with 7:44 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton stifled the Flames' offense, giving up one first down the last two 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers capped the scoring late in the fourth quarter, with a one-yard 
touchdown run with 3:13 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras completed five of nine passes for 104 yards and running back Nick 
Rueda added 76 yards in eight carries for the Bobcats. 
</P>
<P>
 Laramy Lumley ran for 31 yards in 11 carries to lead the Flames' offense.

times, but scored three touchdowns for host Liberty Christian (5-1-1, 1-0-1). 
Liberty Christian led, 27-0, at halftime.

PREP CROSS-COUNTRY / MT. SAC INVITATIONAL; TRABUCO HILLS GIRLS GRAB SOME 
ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Trabuco Hills girls' cross-country team earned some long-awaited respect 
Saturday at the Mt. San Antonio Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing against some of the nation's elite runners, the Mustangs finished 
second in the team sweepstakes race, scoring 172 points, behind Thousand Oaks 
(65), which is ranked 15th nationally by Harrier magazine, and ahead of county 
foes El Toro (173) and Irvine (181). 
</P>
<P>
 "My feet aren't touching the ground right now," said an ecstatic Trabuco Hills 
Coach Jack Recla. "Our whole goal is to make it to State. . . . Maybe this year 
we'll get it together." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs, ranked seventh in the county, were overlooked for the 
sweepstakes race in last week's county championships, which included 12 of the 
county's top teams. That denial worked as perfect motivation on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about rankings, but the girls look at them," Recla said. "They 
wonder why we don't get any respect . . . even though we keep winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks junior Kim Mortensen ran 18 minutes 24 seconds to take top 
honors, but it was the pack of Peggy Hall (14th in 19:28), Megan MacLeod (23rd 
in 19:51) and Melissa Keenan (26th in 19:58) that enabled the Mustangs to hold 
off the county's two top-ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, which won the county championship last week and is ranked first in the 
latest sportswriters poll, was led by junior Jessica Corbin, who ran with the 
leaders in the first mile of the three-mile course before fading to a 
seventh-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "My style this year has been to kind of lay back and then make up ground in 
the end, but that hasn't worked so I just tried to go out a little harder," 
said Corbin, who ran 19:05 for the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos freshman Kim Bates turned in the day's fastest time for a county 
runner, finishing fourth in 18:45 to lead the Griffins to a sixth-place team 
finish (199 points). 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a lot better than I thought I would," said Bates, who ran the hilly 
course for the first time Saturday. "I wanted to run well because this is the 
biggest invitational that we've run in this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Rosa sophomore Julia Stamps stole the show, taking the lead in the 
individual sweepstakes 100 meters into the race and never looking back. She 
finished in 16:58, breaking the two-year-old course record of 17:15 set by 
Fallbrook's Milena Glusac.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just made sure that I went hard on the downhill and maintained on the 
flat," Stamps said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente senior Nancy Dollar finished fourth in the same race (18:56). 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' competition, Capistrano Valley standout Adalberto Sanchez was the 
lone area athlete to break 16:00, winning his race in the early Division I race 
in 15:25. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, the county champion last week, beat Redlands' Tedros Berhane by more 
than 40 seconds to lead the Cougars to a second-place finish (107 points) 
behind Madera (62). 
</P>
<P>
 The Dana Hills boys' and girls' squads were winners. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls, ranked fifth in the county, were led by sophomore Sidney Leonard, 
who ran 19:07 for second place. The Dolphins scored 102 points, finishing ahead 
of Arroyo Grande (115) for the Division I title. 
</P>
<P>
 Robby Tuttle paced the Dolphin boys (51 points) ahead of Fresno (71), 
finishing in second place in the late Division I race (16:13). Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Dana Hills girls' team had the fastest team-time (combination of top five 
runners' times), running 100 minutes 28 seconds, ahead of Irvine (100:39), 
Trabuco Hills (100:48) and Los Alamitos (101:06). . . . Santa Ana Valley senior 
Joel Orozco finished 20th in 16:00 in the team sweepstakes race, leading the 
Falcons to a 12th-place finish. . . . El Toro's Martin Pennell appears fully 
recovered from an Aug. 26 car crash, finishing fifth (16:19) in the Division I 
varsity race. . . . Garrett Jensen of Sunny Hills ran away from the competition 
in the Division II race, running 16:17. . . . Troy's Elizabeth Sinclair ran 
19:29 to win the Division II race. . . . Los Alamitos' Steve Wucetich (16:18) 
finished second in the Division II race.

JIM MURRAY: ROSE PARADE SCORES AN ACE, GETS A TRULY GRAND MARSHAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two admirals have been grand marshals of the Rose Parade. There have been four 
generals.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, we have a military man this year who climbed clear up to private. In the 
army.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been four men who became President.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, our 1995 marshal never got in office. But he voted. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been three comedians -- Harold Lloyd, Bob Hope and Danny Kaye.  
</P>
<P>
 None of them were any funnier than our 1995 guy is after he has sunk a long 
putt.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been countless show-biz types. Mary Pickford, America's sweetheart, 
was a grand marshal. So was Shirley Temple, America's moppet. John Wayne, 
America's American, rode at the head too. Gregory Peck.  
</P>
<P>
 A ventriloquist's dummy, Charlie McCarthy, made it. As did his ventriloquist, 
Edgar Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
 All kinds of athletic heroes made it. Babe Ruth never did but Henry Aaron did. 
Merlin Olsen presided. So did Pele.  
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sinatra made it. Bing Crosby, no.  
</P>
<P>
 Only one golfer had made it before this year: Arnold Palmer. He won 62 
tournaments, including a U.S. Open, two British Opens and four Masters. Jack 
Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Sam Snead and Bobby Jones never made it.  
</P>
<P>
 But our 1995 Rose Parade grand marshal is -- a little trumpet fanfare, 
professor! -- Juan (Chi Chi) Rodriguez! 
</P>
<P>
 You know something? They couldn't have made a better choice. Mother Teresa, 
perhaps. She's Rodriguez's idol.  
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is the first Puerto Rican to be selected grand marshal. And he's the 
smallest person since Shirley Temple.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Cheech was such a towering figure on the PGA Tour. True, he won 
eight tournaments, 73 fewer than Snead and 65 fewer than Jack Nicklaus. None of 
his eight victories was a major. Nicklaus won more majors than Rodriguez had 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rodriguez didn't roll out of bed with this gorgeous golf swing. He wasn't 
raised on a golf course. Chi Chi learned to play golf with -- get this -- a 
ball made out of a tin can. He tapped it up and down a baseball diamond with a 
club made out of a guava limb. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is the first person to make grand marshal who started out life 
chopping sugar cane or driving the oxen to plow it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started work when I was 7 years old," he says. "In the morning I would sell 
peanuts that my sister had roasted. Then I would go over to the golf club and 
caddie for 25 cents for 18 holes. And that was if you were a good caddie. 
Today, a caddie gets $150 a round and after you hit it, he says, 'Where did 
that go? Anybody see it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Behind every successful kid there is a caring adult, Chi Chi points out. In 
his case, it was the influential Ed Dudley, PGA president and pro at Puerto 
Rico's Rockefeller resort, Dorado Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Dudley came to my house one day, looked around, and said, 'You can't live 
in this,' and got me the down payment on a new house. Then, he said, 'You can't 
get anywhere walking,' and helped me get a car. I was just out of the Army and 
he gave me a job at $300 a month." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before Rodriguez was not only cleaning the members' clubs, he 
was cleaning their clocks with a self-taught swing that looked like nothing so 
much as a guy beating a carpet. As for Rodriguez, he couldn't believe his good 
luck at being able to play with a ball that was not made out of a tomato can 
and didn't say Heinz on it but Titleist. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody liked Chi Chi and, more important, Laurance Rockefeller liked his 
work ethic so much that he bankrolled him on the pro tour.  
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was always a people person, a soft touch for the panhandlers, a show 
for the galleries. He was so small -- 5 feet 6, 118 pounds -- that he tended to 
disappear when he went into the rough. They tell the story of his caddie 
beating around in the high grass one day and a PGA official asking, "Lost 
ball?" And the caddie answering, "Lost golfer. Do we get a free drop if I find 
Chi Chi?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez played to the gallery. When he dropped a long putt, he would hurry 
after it and drop his Panama hat over the hole to keep the ball from bouncing 
out. When some pros complained -- "The great ones never did, it was always the 
guys who missed the cut," Rodriguez says -- Rodriguez cheerfully dropped the 
routine and substituted instead the pose of a swordsman or a successful 
bullfighter, slashing his putter at the air and sheathing it dramatically into 
his belt, a St. George who slew the dragon, bogey.  
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez has come a long way from cane cutter and peanut vendor. He made 
$1,037,105 on the regular tour with the eight victories and a gross of seconds, 
and he has made $4,539,124 on the senior tour with 22 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 He's an important part of the cast of characters at the Ralphs Senior Classic 
at Rancho Park this weekend. He's one of golf's golden guardians now, a 
superstar, not a supporting player, and a major contributor to youth golf, a 
low bow of appreciation to the days when he himself needed that push.  
</P>
<P>
 It set a few of us to remembering another time at Rancho, 32 years ago. It was 
1962 at the L.A. Open and Nicklaus was making his first appearance as a touring 
pro. After the first round, a few of us were standing around in the gathering 
evening gloom when this strange apparition leaned over and intruded itself into 
the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can hit the ball as far as Nicklaus, " it was saying.  
</P>
<P>
 We looked at him. He was as skinny as a one-iron, as small as a ball washer, 
had a thick Latino accent and wore these thick eyeglasses. We were not sure his 
shoes matched. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, sure you can, kid" we said. "Who do you caddie for?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a caddie, I'm a pro," he told us.  
</P>
<P>
 "Who was that? "we asked after he left for his car. Someone looked it up. 
"Juan Rodriguez. Puerto Rico," he said, consulting the program. "The next Jack 
Nicklaus!" 
</P>
<P>
 We all had a good laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never heard of him." someone said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you never will," someone else predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 I often wonder what would have happened if that little character had turned 
around and added, "Not only that, but 30 years from now I'll be coming back 
here as grand marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade. Then there'll be me 
and Eisenhower and Gen. Bradley and Bob Hope and Adm. Halsey and Walt Disney 
and John Wayne and Roy Rogers and Jimmy Stewart and all the greats on the 
wall!"

MIKE DOWNEY: NO NEED TO ARGUE ABOUT IT, RAIDERS ARE SIMPLY BORING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Art Shell and Jeff Hostetler, grumpy old Raiders, are not very entertaining 
people apart from their work. Neither one is much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 In private, Shell is pretty mellow with his players and Hostetler is an 
all-pro practical joker. Inside an elevator a couple of months ago in Spain, 
Hostetler pressed every button with his palms before stepping out, leaving 
Shell trapped in a car that stopped at every floor. Hostetler also leaves 
smelly fish inside teammates' bunks and once slapped a sticker on Howie Long's 
bumper that made Howie the unexpected toast of West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the public eye, Shell and Hostetler have no personality. None. I doubt 
if any NFL coach-quarterback combo has ever been this dull. These two have 
demonstrated none of the brass and none of the sass of, say, Mike Ditka and Jim 
McMahon, whose volatility made every Sunday an explosion waiting to happen.  
</P>
<P>
 This explains at least in part why last Sunday's very public domestic quarrel 
between Shell and Hostetler on a sideline in Miami threw many viewers for a 
loss. Shell is one of those tight-lipped NFL types who wouldn't say Shinola 
about a player if he had a mouthful. Hostetler keeps to himself before and 
after practice, doesn't mingle with the media and ended a preseason group 
interview with a jaunty: "OK, see you guys next season." 
</P>
<P>
 So, we have no idea how Shell feels about Hostetler.  
</P>
<P>
 Or if Hoss hates the boss.  
</P>
<P>
 They keep their thoughts to themselves. Or at least behind closed doors. It is 
a rare day indeed when Shell publicly chastises an individual, and the last 
player about whom he said anything uncomplimentary was probably Marcus Allen, 
who already had split.  
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, meantime, is not as sincere and expansive as Vince Evans, not as 
candid and breezy as Billy Joe Hobert, not as unpredictable and kooky as Todd 
Marinovich and not nearly as available or amiable as Ken Stabler or Jim 
Plunkett.  
</P>
<P>
 I make my living trying -- failing, often -- to report or analyze what 
athletic figures do or say. At times after a game, a coach or athlete will 
utter those immortal words: "You saw it. You write it." Within days, I 
guarantee you, that same person will then remind me that I don't know a single 
thing about football.  
</P>
<P>
 This also means you -- you fans, who sit up there in the stands, as thousands 
will today when the Atlanta Falcons come to the Coliseum. You watch football, 
you have opinions, but professional coaches and athletes believe you never know 
what you are talking about, because few of you have ever smeared Ben Gay all 
over your bodies and gone out there to make tackles. Being such an amateur, I 
know no way to dissect what happened between Shell and Hostetler. What I do 
know is that Shell, although hardly a humorist, made one of the funniest 
remarks of the season by recently saying, "You guys are blowing this thing out 
of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach, do I ever have news for you. In New York, in Chicago, in Philadelphia, 
in San Francisco, in Dallas, in Miami, you name it, if a coach and his 
quarterback screamed at one another the way you and Hostetler did, it would 
have led the nightly TV news over Princess Diana's love life and Iraq's troop 
movement.  
</P>
<P>
 A columnist from Boston called a couple of weeks ago, trolling for anecdotes 
about Art Shell. I told him I didn't have any. Even a national magazine that 
spent endless hours with Shell came away with a feature about what a wonderful 
lineman he used to be, many moons ago. Shell is no Ditka, no Jimmy, no Shula, 
senior or junior. He is no Marv Levy, belting a fight song of his own creation, 
or Buddy Ryan, spewing quotes the way craters ooze lava. Shell is solid and 
stolid. He is stable. He is boring.  
</P>
<P>
 And so are the Raiders. Sadly. Which is probably the problem in the first 
place. This team once specialized in amusement and entertainment. The Raiders' 
offense was dynamic. Their players were institutions, or belonged in one. You 
couldn't wait to see what the Raiders did next. Now you wait and wait for them 
to do anything. To use Rocket Ismail. To get the ball to all those road runners 
who go so fast. To lob the bombs.  
</P>
<P>
 A procession of poor quarterbacks preceded Hostetler, who was the best thing 
to happen to this offense in a long time. Unfortunately, there is no longer an 
offense behind the quarterback. Hostetler is a quarterback who doesn't throw 
long who has a bunch of receivers who love to go long.  
</P>
<P>
 Defenses smother the short pass because they know Hostetler seldom goes long 
and because the Raider rushing game has no bite. Marcus Allen? Eric Dickerson? 
Heck, at this point I'd settle for Todd Peat back in the backfield, blocking 
with all of his Refrigeratoresque 330 pounds. At least then the Raiders could 
run the ball rather than pass it when they need two crummy yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell wants to let Hostetler call plays about as much as Dan Reeves wanted 
John Elway to. But somebody had better call plays better than the ones the 
Raiders are calling now. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because the argument between Shell and Hostetler was the most interesting 
thing the Raiders have done all season, that's why. And if one of them has to 
leave town at season's end, I'm afraid it's going to be the wrong one.

RAIDERS NEED TO WIN TO KEEP HOPES ALIVE; PRO FOOTBALL: THEY WILL HAVE TO STOP 
ATLANTA'S RUN-AND-SHOOT OFFENSE, LED BY QUARTERBACK JEFF GEORGE, TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether the recent unpleasantries between quarterback Jeff Hostetler and Coach 
Art Shell have blown over or not, one thing is certain about today's game 
against the Atlanta Falcons at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders must win or they can probably kiss their playoff hopes goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a 2-4 football team that can't be concerned about how many games are 
left on our schedule," Shell said. "I've told the team that we have to look at 
the Atlanta Falcons as the only game left this season. We have to start 
(playing well) this week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are coming off a 20-17 overtime loss at Miami, in which they blew 
a 10-point first-quarter lead. The Raider defense made a strong showing, but 
the offense struggled, prompting a sideline shouting match between Hostetler 
and Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, Shell declined comment on the matter, saying that as far as 
he was concerned, the incident was over. Hostetler, on the other hand, defended 
his questioning of the team's play calling under offensive coordinator Tom 
Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened between them is over with," guard Kevin Gogan said. "Two people 
got in a little argument and that was it. Stuff like that happens all of the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 But is it really over? 
</P>
<P>
 Although Shell refused to talk about what happened with Hostetler this week, 
he did respond to a question about the Raiders' game plan for play calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our plan is a problem, then we would change plans, but that has not been 
the case," Shell said. "Our (game plans) are not the problem, so we have to get 
the players to make plays." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to get the right players on the field, the Raiders made three 
offensive lineup changes this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Williams, who gained 72 yards against the Dolphins, will get his first 
start at tailback since signing with the Raiders from Kansas City during the 
off-season. He replaces Tyrone Montgomery, who will become the backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Another player getting his first start as a Raider will be left tackle Robert 
Jenkins, who signed as a free agent from the Rams during training camp. 
Jenkins, who has played mostly as a right tackle in his nine-year career, will 
replace Gerald Perry, who will be sidelined because of a broken ankle for at 
least four games. 
</P>
<P>
 The third new starter is Greg Skrepenak at right tackle. Skrepenak, a 1992 
second-round pick from Michigan, gets his first start, replacing Bruce 
Wilkerson, who had trouble pass-blocking several times against the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Were these moves made out of desperation by a losing team? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that we're just grabbing for straws because we're desperate," 
said Williams, who leads the team in rushing with 227 yards and has 12 catches 
for 121 yards. "We just have to do something different to start winning again." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the Raiders made a couple of changes on defense, inserting Rob 
Fredrickson at linebacker and Albert Lewis at cornerback. The moves worked, and 
the Raiders won their next game, defeating New England at Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they're hoping for the same results against Atlanta, but it won't be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under first-year Coach June Jones, the Falcons (4-3) are second in the NFC 
West behind the San Francisco 49ers. They are coming off a 42-3 loss to the 
49ers last week. 
</P>
<P>
 They are led by quarterback Jeff George, who has completed 69% of his passes 
for 1,773 yards and 11 touchdowns in his first season with Atlanta after 
playing four seasons with the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff has done a great job and has a pretty good feel for our offense," Jones 
said of George's command of the Falcons' run-and-shoot attack. "But I've always 
felt that it always takes a quarterback somewhere like seven, eight or nine 
games before they really get comfortable in what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 With George spreading the ball around, the Falcons' wide receivers -- they use 
four at a time -- have caught a lot of passes and two players are on pace to 
catch 100 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Terance Mathis leads the team with 51 catches and needs to average 5.4 
receptions a game the rest of the season to reach 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro Bowl player Andre Rison is the team's big-play receiver with 49 catches 
and six touchdowns. Rison needs to average 5.7 catches for the rest of the 
season to reach 100. 
</P>
<P>
 The other starting wide receivers are former Washington Redskin Ricky Sanders 
and rookie speedster Bert Emanuel, formerly of UCLA. The four starters have 
caught 152 passes for 1,698 yards and 12 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 A slim-downed Craig (Ironhead) Heyward, who has three touchdowns rushing, and 
Erric Pegram, who rushed for more than 1,000 yards last season, handle the 
running duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a tough offense to stop and their quarterback is the key," Shell 
said. "Rison is their main guy, but they distribute the ball well." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, the Falcons have had their problems, giving up 103 points in 
their three losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Their defensive line has been a weak link, with former 49er Pierce Holt being 
the most experienced player. Opponents are averaging 3.7 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Former USC standout Clay Matthews is in his 17th season in the league and 
starts at inside linebacker next to veteran Jessie Tuggle, who's in his eighth 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 D.J. Johnson, who is tied with Terry McDaniel for the league lead in 
interceptions with five, and Vinnie Clark, who has four, start at cornerback 
for the Falcons.

RAMS EXPECT EVERETT TO COME OUT FIRING; PRO FOOTBALL: THE TEAM WILL BE RELYING 
ON JEROME BETTIS AND CHRIS MILLER TO LIFT IT TO 4-4, HEADING INTO A BYE WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 No, the Rams will not collectively yell, "Boo!" at Jim Everett today in the 
Superdome in an effort to rattle their former starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan of attack all week has been to say nice things about Everett, recall 
the good old days when Everett was on target and gloss over the frazzled 
Everett of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect Jim to come out and play well, and we better be ready," said Darryl 
Henley, Ram cornerback. "Jim will accept a challenge. Take away the past few 
years and Jim could have run for mayor here. He put up big numbers, has a real 
strong arm and you know it's gut-check time for him now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling you we better be ready. No one has ever said Jim Everett isn't 
smart, and he has good football savvy and I know he will calm himself down and 
prepare himself to play well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will try to keep pressure on Everett and will certainly blitz him, 
but they will also concentrate on wide receiver Michael Haynes, whose specialty 
is catching the deep pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are going to throw the ball deep a lot more than they have 
because you know Jim's going to be fired up," said Todd Lyght, Ram cornerback. 
"Jim's played in a lot of big games, so you know he's going to handle the 
pressure. We can't concern ourselves with Jim Everett. What really matters is 
what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will rely on Jerome Bettis and Chris Miller to lift them to 4-4 as 
they head into their bye week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis ran for 212 yards in 28 carries last December as the Rams ended a 
seven-game losing streak against the Saints with a 23-20 victory in the 
Superdome. Bettis, who gained 102 yards in the Rams' first game against New 
Orleans last season, will face a defense against which San Diego's Natrone 
Means gained 120 yards and Chicago's Lewis Tillman gained 100. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows how good Bettis is better than we do," said Jim Mora, New 
Orleans coach. "This guy is as good a back as there is in the league right now, 
and to slow down the Ram offense, you better do a great job against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're worried about that because we have not done a good job against good 
running backs this year. This is a major concern to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, who is averaging a league-high 26 carries, has limited his practice 
the last few weeks because of the pounding he has taken in running 182 times 
for 660 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're extra cautious in the running game because they have been 
getting beat up by the running game," Bettis said. "When you're in desperate 
situations you do desperate things and this is a must win for them, so I expect 
them to pull out all stops to shut down the run. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means we're going to have to mix it up. That's what it's all about for 
this team. If Chris Miller has a great year, this team has a great year. We 
have all the pieces of the puzzle together and the last piece is the 
quarterback. If our quarterback has a great year, we're on the move." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 2-3 as Everett's replacement, has passed the ball well the last two 
weeks after being handicapped by a series of injuries. He practiced without 
problems last week, has taken a liking to tight end Troy Drayton, throws deep 
as well as almost anybody else in the NFL and appears prepared to kick-start a 
Ram offense that has failed to score 20 points in a game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try and pound them with Bettis early -- that's what the 
coaches are talking about," Miller said. "But when we have to throw, I'll be 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Although still looking for more consistency on offense, the Rams have jumped 
on their last four opponents in the first half. They held on to defeat Kansas 
City and the New York Giants, but second-half swoons cost them victories 
against Atlanta and Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the key in this game," Lyght said. "The mark of good teams is the 
ability to finish their opponent off, and we haven't done that. . . . "We've 
been here so many times with the chance to turn the corner, and have blown it. 
Here we are again with a chance to do something in the second half of the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 A victory for New Orleans (2-5) is also essential to their well-being the 
remainder of the season. For the Rams, who have a favorable schedule down the 
stretch, it's a chance to win four games before the end of October for the 
first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important game for the team to win, so it's important for me to 
play well," said Everett, who has completed 62.8% of his passes with nine 
touchdowns and seven interceptions. "I admit I'll have a little extra emotion 
for it, but the real thing is how the team does, not how I do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "The matchup with Everett means nothing," said Sean Gilbert, Ram defensive 
tackle, who will sit out because of a sore shoulder. "Everett's with another 
team, God bless him. I wish him all the luck and hope he can find some way in 
his heart to have a bad game against us. Or, at least have a good game and 
still have us come out on top."

CLIPPER UPDATE; FISH MIGHT CATCH ON WITH TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Center Matt Fish was a longshot to make the Clippers when training camp opened 
two weeks ago, but if he continues to play as he has in the Clippers' first two 
exhibitions, he might make the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to think positive at all times because they never really give you 
any clue of what's going on," Fish said."You've got to guess at what's in their 
heads. But I think if I keep hustling, maybe I'll have a shot to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fish, who graduated from North Carolina Wilmington in 1992, has spent the last 
two seasons shuffling between European basketball leagues and the Continental 
Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 11 and 265 pounds, he helped the Quad City Thunder win the CBA title 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fish is great," Clipper rookie swingman Eric Piatkowski said. "He gets out 
there and he works his tail off." 
</P>
<P>
 Fish has also impressed Coach Bill Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as he keeps playing the way he has, it's going to make it interesting 
on the roster," Fitch said. " . . . If he improves as much in the next two 
weeks as he has in the last two weeks, I'd say he has a pretty good chance of 
playing here and helping us. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) he's not in good shape. He gets so excited and he's always on the trail 
end (of the fast break). He reminds me of a horse I bet on that's still out 
there running." 
</P>
<P>
 Lamond Murray, the Clippers top draft pick, will practice for the first time 
tonight at UC Irvine. CHRIS BAKER

GRANT WAS ONE WHO GOT AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The one who got away came back, though still not nearly long enough for the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Horace Grant was the player they wanted in the off-season free-agent chase, 
the player they thought would be an impact power forward and part of the 
foundation for the rebuilding, the player they believed would be the remedy for 
the considerable ailments associated with rebounding and interior defense. The 
player they thought they were going to get. 
</P>
<P>
 "Horace Grant was a big disappointment," owner Jerry Buss said the other day. 
"I literally was waiting for the phone to ring." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how close the Lakers were to landing Grant. Except when the call came, 
it was to say they had lost out to the Orlando Magic, a second-best finish in 
the summer that hurt as much as the 18th-best finish last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was close," said Grant, at the Forum on Friday and Saturday with the Magic 
for the GTE Everything Pages Shootout. "I respect Mr. Buss and especially Jerry 
West for their attitudes and their way of life, meaning they take care of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team (the Magic) and the Lakers, it was tough. But for some reason, 
Orlando wooed me a little bit more. I felt like I was in high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant had 18 points and eight rebounds in only 27 minutes Friday night as the 
Magic defeated the Lakers, 125-100. Saturday night, in the championship game of 
the four-team tournament, he had five points and nine rebounds to help the 
Magic rout the Philadelphia 76ers, 116-88. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers got 34 points from Cedric Ceballos and 15 points, 17 rebounds and 
six blocked shots from Vlade Divac to defeat the Denver Nuggets, 114-107, in 
the consolation game. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing six games in nine days, the Lakers (4-2) conclude the exhibition 
schedule with a two-game trip, Tuesday against the SuperSonics at Vancouver and 
Thursday against the Jazz at Ogden, Utah. They open the regular season Nov. 4 
at Detroit.

BASEBALL OWNERS CUTTING PLAYERS' SALARY GUARANTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Major league baseball owners, perhaps preparing for unilateral implementation 
of their salary-cap proposal, are making significant revisions, including 
removal of the $1-billion-a-year salary guarantee for the players, a management 
lawyer said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The removal of any salary guarantee, the lawyer said, was a response to the 
more than $500 million that the clubs have lost since start of the player 
strike on Aug. 12. The proposal, first presented to the players on June 14 and 
unchanged until now, still contains the cap, elimination of salary arbitration 
and major modifications in free agency, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in addition to removal of the salary guarantee, the proposal now 
establishes a salary scale for younger players starting at a rookie minimum of 
$115,000 and up to $500,000 for a fourth-year player, and eliminates the 
proposed 50-50 split of licensing revenue, allowing the union to keep whatever 
it generates. 
</P>
<P>
 The management lawyer insisted that the revisions are strictly part of the 
negotiating process, but others familiar with the situation said the owners are 
preparing to implement their last, best offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, said union head Donald Fehr, the players are not going to accept 
the cap. Thus, they are not really affected by the removal of the guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was illusionary to begin with. It was a joke to begin with," Fehr said. 
"It was a guarantee only if revenues in it go down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, when you guarantee something, it's a guarantee against certain 
contingencies. In this case, if revenues went down, the guarantee went. If 
revenues went up, salaries would still be depressed by the cap. The bottom line 
is that mediator or not, the owners are back to their old tactics. They don't 
want to negotiate, they don't want to talk to us. They only want to talk to the 
press." 
</P>
<P>
 The revised proposal is expected to be presented to the union during the next 
joint meeting with special mediator William J. Usery, who is scheduled to meet 
with the two sides separately this week.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; BIG NAMES TO TAKE THEIR CUTS IN '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Salary cap or not, major league owners are squeezing the players financially. 
Call it checkbook diplomacy -- except that there is nothing very diplomatic 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Clubs are trying to reduce their player payrolls by 20% or more while flooding 
the free-agent market and avoiding arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't sustain this type of financial impact and not have it result in a 
major impact on payroll," Dodger Executive Vice President Fred Claire said, 
echoing what owners' negotiator Richard Ravitch has been saying throughout the 
sporadic bargaining negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words: 
</P>
<P>
 The system under which the players will or will not play in 1995 has yet to be 
determined, but the reaction to the economic impact of the strike and the 
anticipated impact on 1995 sales will go beyond a reduction of front-office and 
scouting staffs, reaching the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that clubs have already guaranteed $540 million to 168 players in 
1995 as part of previously signed multiyear contracts plays into it, reducing 
financial flexibility. Only seven of the 28 clubs start the signing season with 
salary guarantees under $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants, for example, have guaranteed more than $20 million 
to Barry Bonds, Matt Williams, Mark Portugal and Robby Thompson. The Houston 
Astros have committed $21.95 million to five players; the Texas Rangers $15.85 
million to three; the Toronto Blue Jays $32.3 million to seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to see more rookies and younger players in 1995 than ever 
before," Ravitch predicts, adding as part of his salary-cap sales pitch that he 
doesn't see how the union can continue to favor a system in which only 10% of 
the players receive more than 50% of the compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, thanks to the rebirth of their farm system, had already resumed 
growing their own players and are continuing that process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the driving force in our decision-making process, but you can't look 
at this situation and not have the budget be a factor," Claire said. "Our 
payroll will drop significantly." 
</P>
<P>
 It was $37.1 million last year. The club could shed $10.55 million in 1994 
salaries if none of seven free agents are re-signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cory Snyder, Roger McDowell and Jim Gott definitely appear gone, taking $4.55 
million in salary. Kevin Gross, who became a free agent again when the Dodgers 
refused to offer arbitration as part of the repeater-rights process, may be 
re-signed, but not at his $2.7-million salary of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Brett Butler, $3.5 million, and third baseman Tim Wallach, $3.3 
million, are likely to return as insurance if Roger Cedeno and Ron Coomer are 
not ready -- "We're going to be making important evaluations all winter," 
Claire said in reference to the winter leagues -- but that will also depend on 
the price of the Butler and Wallach premiums. There may be too much emotion 
and, yes, loyalty, involved to let Orel Hershiser leave, but loyalty might not 
translate to his $3-million salary of '94. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fortunate to have so many young players arrive at the same time," 
Claire said. "We've never had this much quality young talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every club can make that boast, but most are pursuing that approach. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 45 veteran players -- Gross being an example -- who lacked the five 
years necessary to repeat as free agents but could do so if their clubs failed 
to offer arbitration by midnight Wednesday. Only two -- Chili Davis of the 
Angels and Darryl Strawberry of the San Francisco Giants -- were retained by 
the offer of arbitration. Some will be re-signed by their previous clubs, but 
at lower salaries than they were making and without the divisive and 
inflationary arbitration process. 
</P>
<P>
 And many will not be re-signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among several illustrations is what could be a loyalty lesson for Hershiser. 
The Atlanta Braves uprooted third baseman Terry Pendleton, their cornerstone of 
the '90s, and will replace him with Chipper Jones or Jose Oliva yielding a 
projected payroll cut of more than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, there are very few options being exercised. The Oakland A's, for 
example, refused to pick up the 1995 option on relief ace Dennis Eckersley at 
$4 million and will try to re-sign him as a free agent for considerably less. 
The Philadelphia Phillies refused to pick up options on reliever Doug Jones at 
$3.25 million or Pete Incaviglia at $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be as many as 200 free agents diluting the market. A few, such as 
Bill Swift, John Franco, Gregg Jefferies and Larry Walker, should do well. So 
will Jack McDowell and Jim Abbott, providing the dispute over service time 
during the strike is resolved in their favor and they are ruled eligible for 
free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, many name players are likely to come up empty.  
</P>
<P>
 How ironic. As the owners continue to pursue a salary cap and new compensation 
system, they are now underscoring what the players have always tried to tell 
them: A free market will always react to economic conditions and adjust itself. 
Particularly when sound financial policy and good management are used. 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION? 
</P>
<P>
 You may need a program to identify baseball's new managers and general 
managers, but you won't need a color chart. 
</P>
<P>
 They're all white. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years after the Al Campanis incident generated a commitment to minority 
hiring, no minority holds the position of president or CEO and only one serves 
as a general manager -- Bob Watson of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 There are four minority managers -- Montreal's Felipe Alou, San Francisco's 
Dusty Baker, Colorado's Don Baylor and Toronto's Cito Gaston -- but what there 
is of a commitment has largely been delivered at the administrative or 
non-decision-making level. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the last three months: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs hired new presidents -- Mark 
Lamping and Andy MacPhail, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Minnesota Twins promoted personnel director Terry Ryan to replace 
MacPhail as general manager; MacPhail hired New York Met vice president Ed 
Lynch to replace Larry Himes as the Cubs' general manager; Lamping hired 
Colorado assistant general manager Walt Jocketty to replace the fired Dal 
Maxvill as Cardinal general manager; the Texas Rangers fired Tom Grieve as 
general manager and hired Baltimore's personnel director, Doug Melvin, and the 
Blue Jays promoted assistant general manager Gord Ash to replace retiring Pat 
Gillick. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Kansas City Royals fired manager Hal McRae (who became the Cincinnati 
Reds' hitting coach) and hired Cincinnati coach Bob Boone; the Orioles fired 
Johnny Oates and hired Cleveland pitching coach Phil Regan; the Rangers fired 
Kevin Kennedy and hired Oates; the Boston Red Sox fired Butch Hobson and hired 
Kennedy; the Cubs fired Tom Trebelhorn and hired San Diego manager Jim 
Riggleman, leaving the Padres to hire third base coach Bruce Bochy. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a total of 13 key positions filled. And although there is no disputing 
the credentials of any of the new general managers, or the loudly applauded 
appointment of the respected MacPhail to provide the Cubs with some long-absent 
stability and leadership, or the managerial potential of Regan and Boone at a 
time when the Red Sox and Rangers couldn't wait to recycle Kennedy and Oates, 
the absence of a minority in all of it is glaringly conspicuous. 
</P>
<P>
 "It only illustrates again that we have to have more people in the pipeline so 
that there's a natural progression when the opportunities come up," acting 
Commissioner Bud Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig discussed the situation with league presidents Leonard Coleman and Gene 
Budig in Milwaukee on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced that the clubs are sensitive to the issue and conscientious 
about it," he said. "Our overall (minority employment) percentages have 
continued to go up. Our last grade from Richard Lapchick (a Northeastern 
University sociologist who rates various industries on their minority hiring) 
was a B. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we still have to do a better job of identifying people and 
getting them in the pipeline, as Bob Watson was. Do we have a ways to go? Yes. 
Will we get there? Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 At the pace of the last three months? Never.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; PAST EIGHT MONTHS HAVE BEEN A DOWNHILL TUMBLE FOR 
CARBAJAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Michael Carbajal, the tumble began, as fighters' tumbles almost always do, 
with a loss in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal admits he never imagined losing to Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez or 
anybody else, and it's a surer bet he never contemplated the skidding his 
career would take from there. 
</P>
<P>
 Last February at the Forum, Carbajal was confused by, then beaten by, 
Gonzalez's stuttering in-and-out attack during their highly anticipated 
rematch. Carbajal lost his light-flyweight titles, and, it seems, a little bit 
of the tight focus that had guided him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Carbajal avoids putting an emphasis on how much losing the decision 
to Gonzalez affected his life and career, what followed was a chaotic series of 
events that even his most loyal friends say has caused at least temporary 
damage to his previously pristine image. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the second Gonzalez fight, Carbajal had climbed as high and earned as 
much money as any fighter in the lighter divisions ever had. Triggered by his 
devastating knockout of Gonzalez the year before, Carbajal was generally 
considered one of the top dozen fighters in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the loss in February, not only were many experts questioning his 
status, but Carbajal began jeopardizing it himself. 
</P>
<P>
 First, days after winning the lightly regarded World Boxing Organization 
108-pound belt -- since voluntarily relinquished -- Carbajal shocked his 
long-time promoter, Bob Arum, by signing with Arum's archenemy, Don King. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, Carbajal was arrested in an incident allegedly involving a 
gun outside a party and became the center of reports in Phoenix about his 
alleged ties to gang activity in his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was blown out of proportion like crazy," Carbajal said last week, 
in town to promote his third light-flyweight showdown against Gonzalez, Nov. 12 
in Mexico City. "Like my father would tell me, there's always going to be 
people to bring you down once you get to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, now I understand what my father was telling me." 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal, a 1984 Olympic silver medalist, had been held up in Phoenix as 
someone who stayed in the downtrodden neighborhood in which he was born, but 
avoided the gang lifestyle that dominated it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, members of the Gang Squad division of the Phoenix police say they believe 
some members of Carbajal's family are gang members, and one Phoenix newspaper 
reported that Carbajal held a meeting in his home to coach some gang members on 
what to tell police after a shooting death outside his home last New Year's 
Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 An acquaintance of Carbajal's has been charged with murder in the case and, 
according to Danny Carbajal, the fighter's older brother and trainer, that 
suspect is the source of most of the charges against the Carbajal family. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the incident allegedly involving the gun, after which some witnesses 
said Carbajal flashed gang signals as he departed the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a gang member, I just know everybody from the neighborhood," Carbajal 
said. "If you want to call them gang members or whatever. . . . They're all 
friends that I grew up with. It doesn't mean I get into the activities that 
they get into or do whatever they do. It's just people I grew up with and I 
talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was this big deal, like the Gang Squad saying they're on my front porch 
and they're talking to me. That doesn't mean I'm associated with them. They 
talk to me, but all we talk about is boxing and whatever. It's not like I'm 
involved in gang activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Danny Carbajal: "There are people that live around that are in gangs, and 
we live in the neighborhood. That doesn't make you a gang member. Why should we 
have to move? 
</P>
<P>
 "We live there because we're comfortable there. We've lived there all our 
lives. My family has been there since 1930." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, his associates say, Carbajal, who was bothered at first, has been 
able to turn his focus back on the prospect of fighting Gonzalez once again. 
</P>
<P>
 The second rematch has been put together hurriedly and, interestingly, King's 
first promotion of Carbajal will be Carbajal's first professional bout outside 
the United States. Mexico City is Gonzalez's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the two big cards already scheduled for November in Las Vegas, 
Gonzalez-Carbajal III clearly would have been a more profitable event if King 
could have scheduled it in February and put it in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carbajal, intent on regaining the title, gave the go-ahead to Mexico City 
when it was offered -- though his guaranteed purse is definitely less than the 
$1 million King offered him when he signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael just wants to whup him," Danny Carbajal said. "He wants to knock him 
out again. When a fighter has that kind of drive, you can't keep him backing 
off of it. If you sidetrack him, it may not be good." 
</P>
<P>
 So as Carbajal seeks to rebuild his boxing credentials, his camp hopes the 
passage of time -- and the eventual dropping of any charges against him in the 
gun incident -- will restore the faith of his uncertain boxing public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undoubtedly the incidents in Phoenix have taught him," said his attorney, Ben 
Miranda. "He's learned to be a little more cautious about where he goes and not 
to get himself in compromising positions. But other than that, he's still the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have asked us, 'What's wrong with Michael?' But I think only time is 
going to assure people that it's still the same Michael. And only time will 
show he still has the same talent he had throughout his career."

 Meanwhile, Carbajal insists that recent events have not shaken his desire to 
stay in the neighborhood -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to stay until my whole career is over," Carbajal said. "Then I 
might get out of there. After my career is over, I'm pretty sure I'm going to 
move out. I know it's going to be hard, but that's what I'm going to do."

 Where will he move?

 What's next for Pernell Whitaker? Although the consensus pound-for-pound best 
fighter in the world still considers a rematch with Julio Cesar Chavez his No. 
1 option, Whitaker lately has been talking about moving up to face World Boxing 
Council junior-middleweight champion Terry Norris, who is on the Nov. 12 
undercard in Mexico City. Norris was set to fight Whitaker last year, but that 
fell through when Norris lost to Simon Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris regained the title in a rematch last May and doesn't deny that WBC 
welterweight champion Whitaker pops into his mind now and again. "I believe I 
could shut him down," Norris said. "If he reads this, I'm offering him a 
challenge. We're going to find out who's pound-for-pound the best fighter in 
the world. I probably could just overpower him. But the way I'd probably fight 
him is box him, stick and move, outpunch and outbox him." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Teddy Atlas did not deny reports this week that heavyweight champion 
Michael Moorer opened camp last month for his Nov. 5 title defense against 
George Foreman weighing 245 pounds -- well above his usual fighting weight. But 
Atlas says that Moorer, a former light-heavyweight champion, has worked himself 
into excellent shape and will be down to a more natural 220 by fight time. 
</P>
<P>
 Former champion Riddick Bowe says it doesn't matter if the two current title 
holders, Moorer and Oliver McCall, the WBC champion, try to avoid fighting him. 
"I can never be frozen out," said Bowe, who fights Larry Donald Dec. 3 at 
Caesars Palace. "They may try to maneuver and go elsewhere, but when it's all 
said and done, when you want to be the best, you have to fight Riddick Bowe."

 A $13-million boxing program featuring Sylmar's Rafael Ruelas and a 
heavyweight bout between Herbie Hide of England and Tommy Morrison was called 
off Saturday in Hong Kong, one day before it was to be held. Hide is champion 
of the lightly regarded World Boxing Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 At a raucous news conference, Barry Hearn, Hide's manager, said he was 
withdrawing his group of fighters because they were not paid. He said the eight 
fighters on the card were owed a total of more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of hot air, a lot of good promises, a lot of warm words, but 
they don't pay the bills and I'm not in Hong Kong for my health," Hearn said. 
"We came here to see the fighters get paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Arum, one of the show's promoters, said their bankers were unwilling to 
release money to pay the fighters. He said the show, which included two other 
title fights, would be rescheduled within 60 days at a venue and time to be 
announced within a week. Hearn expects the card to take place Dec. 17 in the 
United States but did not say where. 
</P>

 Ireland's Steve Collins was to defend the WBO middleweight crown for the first 
time against American Lonny Beasely, and Ruelas of Sylmar was to defend the IBF 
lightweight title against Billy Schwer, the British champion.

TENNIS / JULIE CART; AFTER 18 MONTHS ON WOMEN'S TOUR, SHE THOUGHT SCHOOL 
SOUNDED BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART

<TEXT>
<P>
 A heartening reverse trend has been spotted, albeit a solitary one: A young 
professional female tennis player wants to turn amateur and go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie Cole of Santa Cruz recently won an NCAA appeal to restore her college 
eligibility after a bleak 18 months on the pro tour. Cole turned pro three 
years ago at 14, reportedly at her father's urging. In her 16-tournament 
career, she earned $550. 
</P>
<P>
 After quitting the tour, Cole enrolled in high school and was reinstated by 
both the U.S. Tennis Assn. and the California Interscholastic Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she decided to go to college but quickly ran up against the NCAA. Last 
year, San Diego State, one of the schools she was considering, filed a request 
to restore Cole's eligibility. It was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Sept. 29, the NCAA's eligibility committee overturned the earlier 
decision and granted Cole limited eligibility. She will be allowed to receive a 
scholarship as a freshman, but Cole won't be permitted to compete in matches. 
All restrictions will be dropped after her freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's terrific for Maggie," said Peter Mattera, women's tennis coach 
at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, however, has not said where she intends to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattera has an obvious interest in arguing that developing players are better 
off honing their skills in college, but even if they do turn pro, he believes 
14 is too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just too early," he said. "I don't think they're fully formed as people. 
I don't know why they would put themselves in the pressure situations that are 
there on the pro tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Division I college tennis offers a high level of competition. It allows you 
to juggle academics, tennis and a social life, which is important: You have to 
learn how to interact socially with your peers, in life and on the tour." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Griffin, San Diego State's NCAA faculty representative, prepared the 
request for Cole's reinstatement. He said the initial rebuff was no surprise 
because, according to the NCAA's definition of professionalism, Cole had 
clearly lost her amateur status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the (NCAA) staff did exactly what it should have done," Griffin said. 
"They are not the ones to set a precedent. But the eligibility committee can 
set a precedent, and it did. In this case . . . I'm quite sure it was because 
of the age that the individual turned pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "We argued that an individual of that age -- given the intellectual ability -- 
can't be expected to know exactly what is happening. To hold them responsible 
for those decisions seems a little harsh." 
</P>
<P>
 So Cole gets a second chance to reclaim her youth and live it in a more normal 
fashion. Her choice to attend college is one indication that she is, now, 
making responsible decisions for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cole's is the cautionary tale that, taking recent events as an indicator, few 
seem to be heeding. Martina Hingis made her professional debut at 14 in Zurich 
this month and -- symbolically framing October as kiddies' month on the WTA 
calendar -- 14-year-old Venus Williams has announced that she will turn pro at 
a WTA Tour event in Oakland on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a tennis prodigy who grew up in Compton but now lives in Florida, 
reportedly made the decision to become a professional against the wishes of her 
parents. And for Halloween, Williams is going to dress up as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Pierce, who turned pro at 14 and now says she wishes she had stayed in 
school, acknowledged that there is a difference between being able to play an 
adult game and successfully living in an adult world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to be able to play professional matches, but it's another 
thing to be a professional player," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Have any of these tennis parents noticed that Jennifer Capriati -- for whom 
the WTA rewrote its rules to allow a 14-year-old in its midst -- has yet to 
return to the tour after her drug bust and time in rehab? Shouldn't her 
experience be the best teacher? 
</P>
<P>
 As yet unexplained in the Williams saga is how a child, barely a teen-ager, 
overrules her parents on such a decision. How does it happen that a 
ninth-grader announces she's quitting school and embarking on a career and her 
parents' reaction is to shrug and say, "Gosh, the little dickens just really, 
really loves to play. Can't keep her off the court. It would break her heart if 
we didn't let her play professionally." 
</P>
<P>
 But isn't that what parents do every day, make difficult decisions that they 
believe are in the best long-term interests of their children, never mind the 
child's crying and tantrums? This rationale would empty the nation's classrooms 
and fill its streets, parks and video parlors with children who really, really 
want to play. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that it's not possible for teen-agers to absolutely know 
their life's passion at an early age. A child lucky enough to know her mind and 
fortunate enough to have the skills should be encouraged. But, as long as she 
is a child, the passion should be nurtured, not exploited. Elementary schools 
place gifted children in special programs, not in Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' talents have certainly not gone unnoticed. She hasn't competed in a 
tournament in three years, but International Management Group, which owns the 
Oakland event, promptly granted her a wild-card entry into the main draw. In 
addition to IMG, the tournament will be thick with tennis agents and potential 
sponsors, all drooling over Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the limitations on having a 14-year-old as a product spokesgirl? Acne 
cream? Bicycles? Orthodontics? 
</P>
<P>
 The best evidence of Williams' immaturity is found in a statement she made to 
Robin Finn of the New York Times. In explaining her ability to make the 
decision, Williams said: "I think I'm more mature than a 14-year-old. . . . 
It's almost like I'm 16." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen? Oh, all right then. By all means.

CROSS-COUNTRY; SANTA ROSA GIRL SHATTERS MT. SAC COURSE RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks High boys' and girls' cross-country teams posted 
triple-digit victory margins in the team sweepstakes races of the Mt. San 
Antonio College Invitational on Saturday, yet were overshadowed by the 
course-record performance of Santa Rosa sophomore Julia Stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamps won the 3,200 meters in the State track and field championships in 
June, but her time of 16 minutes 58 seconds over the three-mile course was 
stunning. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamps' time crushed the previous course best of 17:15 set by Fallbrook's 
Milena Glusac in 1992 and gave her a 72-second margin of victory over Emily 
Allison of San Jose Leland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect to run this fast," Stamps said. "I just wanted to come out 
here and relax and run well and have some fun. I didn't want to get all nervous 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks was the pre-meet favorite in the boys' and girls' team 
sweepstakes, and the Lancers lived up to that billing. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys -- led by the third-place effort of Keith O'Doherty -- placed five 
runners among the first 16 finishers to total 49 points. Carmichael Jesuit was 
second with 149. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks girls, led by individual winner Kim Mortensen, easily won 
over runner-up Trabuco Hills, 65-172.

'TOO MUCH GLOOM'; HUGHES COUPLES FACE TWICE THE FEAR, ANXIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joan and Mike Hutson are part of the lore of Hughes Aircraft Co. in Fullerton. 
Mike established the first all-Hughes, co-ed softball league, the Maverick 
League, in 1980. In fact, the couple met that year when Mike recruited Joan for 
his team. A year later, they were married. 
</P>
<P>
 The Master Batters, as the team was called, was one of the original teams in 
the league, which played softball at the Beatty School in Buena Park once a 
week each summer for eight years.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone at Hughes knew The Master Batters because we had shirts and hats and 
everything," said Mike, 55. Before long the softball nights at the Beatty 
School became a gathering spot for Hughes workers on their way home to stop by 
for a beer and a chat. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the "lifers," such as Lisa McAfee, who not only met her 
current and former husbands at the defense giant, but whose father and brother 
also worked there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Literally, everything I have ever had was paid for by Hughes," said McAfee, 
adding that her life has revolved around the place since her father moved the 
family to Placentia from New York in the '60s. For her first six years with the 
company, she worked alongside her father, who retired in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The 350-acre Fullerton plant has been like a modern-day company town, where 
everyone knows most everyone else and co-workers are often friends or family. 
Even though it has been downsized -- to 6,800 workers from its high of about 
15,000 -- there are still scores of people, like Joan and Mike Hutson and Lisa 
and Dave McAfee, who met at the defense manufacturing plant and later married. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes officials last month announced plans to dismiss as many as 1,000 
employees at the Orange County facility and transfer thousands of others to its 
plants in El Segundo, Long Beach, San Diego and Tucson, Ariz. Everyone working 
at Hughes faces difficult decisions in the coming weeks, but the idea of having 
a job relocated or eliminated weighs especially heavy on the married couples 
who have two careers and two incomes at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Should both spouses accept transfers and move their families to El Segundo, if 
that option is available? Should they commute? What happens if one is sent to 
San Diego or Tucson and the other's department is to remain in Fullerton? What 
is best for the kids? 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes spokesman Richard Dore said that the company cannot take individual 
families' special circumstances into consideration when determining layoffs. 
The company is sympathetic to their plight, but the scope of the transfers is 
simply too large to consider everyone's special situation. All transfers, he 
explained, will be made on the basis of merit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defense downsizing has gone on for years, but many of Hughes' married 
employees became dependent on their sizable double income though they knew that 
it might come to this one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes afforded them the opportunity to achieve the American dream -- a large 
home with a yard and a pool, nice cars, a stable environment in which to raise 
children, and some money in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the friendly workplace atmosphere fostered by company-sponsored 
softball leagues, a bicycle club, ski club and golf club, which led to numerous 
lifelong friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the link to Hughes stretches back to childhood. Joan Hutson's 
history with Hughes goes back 33 years to when she was 10 and her father moved 
the family to California from Nebraska to take a job at Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her first memories of the company were visits to Simpson Park, on the 
north end of the rolling, mostly open Hughes campus. The park has been the site 
for many of the company's social functions, such as a recent Employee 
Appreciation Night celebration. "I have been going to Simpson Park forever," 
said Hutson, who these days takes her kids there for softball games and company 
picnics. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutson's first job as a teen-ager was a summer stint at Hughes doing clerical 
work while she was still a student at Garden Grove High School. That summer she 
rode to work with her dad, who was an engineer, and her brother, who also had a 
Hughes summer job. Her brother also eventually became an engineer for Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Henderson's father also retired from Hughes, after 20 years as a 
business manager. "I really wanted to work here because my dad worked here," 
said Henderson, explaining that a number of her co-workers wanted to retire 
with Hughes because either one or both of their parents did. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In her 20 years working as a Hughes engineer, Henderson said, she has worked 
with her father, sister, brother, brother-in-law and her husband, Curtis, who 
said the plant closing has him worried about what the job turmoil will mean to 
his wife and the couple's three children.  
</P>
<P>
 "She has never lived anywhere else and has never had another job, so she 
doesn't know what to expect," he said. "Even if we do go to El Segundo we will 
have to leave the kids at day care longer (because of an increased commute). 
That would actually be harder on them than it would be on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the emotional strain there would also be an added financial burden. 
The day care center in Anaheim used by the Hendersons charges extra for late 
pickups -- $1 for each minute after 6 p.m. Traffic from El Segundo to Anaheim 
is likely to frequently keep them from arriving on time. 
</P>
<P>
 How the upcoming layoffs and transfers will affect the children is weighing 
heavily on the minds of nearly all Hughes couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether to keep her here in her day care in Fullerton or look 
for a place in El Segundo," said Allison Lengele of her 2-year-old daughter, 
Amber. "And what if she gets sick and I have to leave and drive all the way 
back to Fullerton?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lengele, a Hughes contract negotiator, is pregnant with a second child. She 
works on a Hughes program that is expected to move to El Segundo, but she says 
she won't know for sure where she will end up until the company releases 
further information. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison and husband Michael, an electronics engineer, said they would move out 
of Orange County if they are transferred despite having bought a house in 
Fullerton, minutes away from Hughes, about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lengeles rented a house in Fullerton for several months while they mulled 
over their collective future with Hughes. When they concluded they were going 
to make a commitment to stay with the company, they bought a 27-year-old, 
four-bedroom home about two miles from the plant and embarked on a whirlwind of 
home improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 They have since put in new wood floors, turned their fourth bedroom into a 
family room, added central air conditioning and heating, and landscaped the 
half-acre back yard that is home to their golden retriever, Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple said they believe they could sell the house for the price they 
paid, but Allison says they would never recoup all the money and hard work they 
have put into fixing it up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dale and Gayle Carline are also recent home buyers but, unlike the Lengeles, 
they don't want to sell. "We can't sell this place without taking a bath," 
Gayle, a software engineer said of the 14-year-old, four-bedroom house they 
purchased in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carlines, both software engineers, will most likely be transferred to El 
Segundo, but Gayle said that relocating the family is still out of the 
question. "I have always been in Orange County and I am not sure what is around 
El Segundo," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he loves his job, Dale wants to stay with Hughes despite a transfer, 
she said. There is also the reality that high-paying aerospace jobs are 
difficult to replace. "Try and get a $60,000 salary with a four-year college 
degree somewhere else," she quipped. "It would be hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Joan nor Mike Hutson has a college degree, but each has moved up to 
positions of increasing responsibility at Hughes. She has gone from being a 
clerical worker to a job on the computer staff of the Peace Shield program. 
Mike has worked in several positions in the company's program management 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 They are grateful for the opportunities to advance, and appreciate the 
attractive salary and benefits, but Mike said money is not the principal reason 
he and Joan have been with Hughes for a total of 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been the people. I would stay there forever if I could," he said. "It 
has been a family company, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Maria Henderson enjoys her work tremendously, but said that the 
company of her co-workers has been equally important in her decision to remain 
at Hughes for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have girlfriends here who have been my friends for 20 years. You work with 
people for so long that they become like your family and it is really hard 
wondering if some of them are going to be around much longer."

JAMES FLANIGAN: HOME COMPUTERS ARE IN SAME SPOT AS MODEL T IN 1919

 The home computer, centerpiece of an emerging industry with enormous 
possibilities, is right now where the automobile was in 1919 -- on the verge of 
a takeoff that will make it a familiar product in 80% of American homes within 
five years and a necessity of life within a decade.

 That takeoff will accelerate this Christmas shopping season as an estimated 7 
million consumers plunk down $2,000 apiece to take home a computer for work and 
play. It's no fad. By one count, sales of home computers will surpass sales of 
office computers this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Already the home market is driving major business events, such as the 
negotiations between one-time rivals IBM and Apple Computer toward an agreement 
in which IBM would invest in Apple in return for rights to use the Macintosh 
software operating system. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Microsoft agreed last week to pay $1.5 billion for Intuit Co., developer 
of the personal finance program Quicken, with an eye to the growing millions 
who keep track of investments on home computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new mass market is coming fast. According to Dataquest, a San Jose 
research firm, 6.9 million computers will be sold for home use this year, 
compared to 10 million for "professional" use. Other research firms -- Computer 
Intelligence Infocorp and Link Resources -- count separately computers used for 
work at home and conclude that "home" and office computers are now neck and 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
 And the growth, 30% a year, is in the home; from 32 million U.S. homes with 
computers today to more than 80 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The business is going to be enormous and the biggest companies are struggling 
to get it right. IBM brought out a new line of home computers this year, called 
Aptiva, but underestimated demand for them and so won't have enough in the 
stores this Christmas season. Longer term, though, IBM could recover some of 
its lost glory in the home market. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations with Apple are discussing just how much IBM will pay for rights 
to Macintosh -- reports say $1 billion. "A linkup would have advantages for 
both companies," says computer consultant Bob Djurdjevic, head of Annex 
Research in Phoenix. Gaining the easy-to-use Macintosh operating system would 
help IBM in consumer markets, while IBM's backing would lend market power to 
Apple, which after all the years still has only 10% of the personal computer 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple's position in the home is ironic. From its start in 1977, Apple produced 
the most consumer-friendly computers. But for over a decade its energies have 
been spent fighting IBM, Compaq, Dell and AST Research -- all of which have had 
their own problems -- in business markets. Now Apple has another chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The home market should be Apple's," says Ian Gilson, computer analyst at Van 
Kasper & Co., a Los Angeles investment firm. "If it misses it, then worries 
about the company's future could be well founded." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, home computing's greatest success thus far is Packard Bell, a 
smallish Westlake Village company -- $2.3 billion in revenue this year -- that 
took on an old television brand name when it started business in 1986. From the 
beginning, Packard Bell operated on two key insights: It sold computers through 
Wal-Mart, Sam's, Price/Costco, Sears and other mass retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 And it produced the most powerful computers possible, because founder Beny 
Alagem understood that home users needed more computer power than office tasks 
demand. Home customers use computers for games, personal finance, education for 
the kids and lately to communicate through the Internet or services such as 
Prodigy, America Online and Compuserve. 
</P>
<P>
 They want processing speed, powerful modems and the ability to create three 
dimensional effects in games and educational programs. Thus, home customers 
have provided the big market for Intel's powerful Pentium microprocessor. And 
their demands will push development of more powerful processors, Intel's P6 due 
in 1996 and PowerPC's 620 version on which Motorola and IBM plan production 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "As capability increases, so must the sophistication of our programs," says 
Robert Davidson, president of Davidson & Associates, producer of "Math 
Blaster," "Kid Phonics" and other educational software. 
</P>
<P>
 The Davidson company, founded by former schoolteacher Janice Davidson, also 
reflects a deeper trend: With entry to the home, computer technology loses its 
ivory tower image and instead becomes increasingly democratic. Educational 
programs are created not by scientists but by former schoolteachers like 
Davidson and Ann McCormick, founder of The Learning Co., who now is starting up 
another company named Media 3. 
</P>
<P>
 People do their own thinking and talking on the Internet; they don't sit 
listening to government or experts tell them what to think. 
</P>
<P>
 And further possibilities of the home computer are only dimly perceived as 
yet. To begin with, comparisons to television are imprecise; the computer is 
more than an entertainment appliance. Rather, like the refrigerator, it will be 
left on all the time and will control lighting, heating and air conditioning in 
the home. Electric utilities as well as telephone companies will have a greater 
connection to the home computer than is recognized today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steven P. Jobs, the founder of Apple Computer, saw the implications years ago. 
"As the bicycle extends muscle power, allowing human beings to go farther and 
faster," Jobs used to say in Apple's early days, "so the computer extends the 
mind, allowing us to learn more, know more." 
</P>
<P>
 It took Henry Ford, who built the Model T in 1908, a decade to sell 1 million 
of them. But after that, ten million were sold within five years and then more 
and more as Americans seized on the automobile, as Ford himself put it, "to get 
out of the shells in which they had been living." 
</P>
<P>
 There may not yet be a computer equivalent of the Model T, but one is just 
around the corner. And so is the enormous industry and social revolution that 
goes with it.

THE PRICE OF BACKING AWAY; TRADING: NASDAQ MARKET MAKERS OFTEN DON'T HONOR THE 
PRICES THEY DISPLAY. COMPLAINTS ABOUND, BUT NASD SAYS MOST ARE FRIVOLOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On trading desks across the country, the video screens of Nasdaq computer 
terminals glow with stock symbols and price quotes, displaying the list of 
market makers who deal in each stock and the prices at which they stand ready 
to buy or sell shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulation -- what's known as the "firm quote rule" -- requires market 
makers to honor the prices they display. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nasdaq market makers often do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Oct. 4, traders had filed 4,748 complaints this year alleging Nasdaq 
market makers "backed away" from their obligation to trade at posted prices. 
Over several months, a reporter visiting various trading desks witnessed more 
than two dozen instances in which market makers at least appeared to renege on 
this duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Backing away leaves small investors to buy at higher prices or sell shares for 
less than the posted quotes. And interviews with traders and officials of the 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers, which operates Nasdaq, as well as 
examination of scores of formal backing-away complaints, strongly suggest that 
the NASD is doing little to stop the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 While James M. Cangiano, the NASD's executive vice president for market 
surveillance, insists the group takes backing-away complaints "very, very 
seriously," the NASD confirms that it has taken no public action in response to 
any of the complaints filed this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, firms accused of backing away -- and the NASD itself -- contend that 
the vast majority of complaints are frivolous. NASD officials deny that backing 
away is widespread and note that most complaints are filed by a group of small, 
maverick market makers who, they contend, are simply out to harass the big, 
established market-making firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling at posted prices would seem to be a fundamental element of a stock 
market's operations. But just as Nasdaq's fragmented trading system often fails 
to make the market's best prices available to small investors, backing away 
means investors often aren't getting the market makers' quoted prices, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like you go into a store and this has a $3 price tag on it," said 
Phillip A. Dina of Dina Securities in Wayne, N.J., picking up a tape dispenser 
from his desk to make the point. "What would you do if you walked up to the 
counter with it and the lady said, 'Oh, no, it's now $3.25'? That's what 
happens on Nasdaq all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran traders say backing away occurs because, with little risk of serious 
penalty, it enables market makers to pick and choose who they want to trade 
with. It also lets them concentrate on making money by buying and selling for 
their firms' own accounts, rather than honoring their obligation to trade with 
all comers. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the larger Nasdaq stocks -- such as Apple Computer, Microsoft and MCI 
-- have many market makers, few of the dealers are really interested in trading 
actively at any given moment, market professionals say. Most "are just 
interested in trading their own accounts," said Robert M. Gintel, chairman of 
the Gintel Group of mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealers post quotes because Nasdaq rules require them to do so. But, said 
Gintel, "out of 20 market makers for a stock, maybe two are really interested 
in trading at any given time." The rest, he said, "will scurry like rabbits to 
get out of the way" of unsolicited trades, swiftly changing their quotes if an 
unwanted order comes in on which they cannot be sure of making a profit. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 13, while a reporter was present on the trading floor of a New York 
market maker in Nasdaq stocks, a trader -- on instructions from an individual 
investor -- tried to sell 500 shares of Intuit Inc. This was hours before 
Microsoft Corp. announced its bid to buy Intuit, and the software firm's stock 
had been bouncing around in anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
 The trader offered to sell the shares to Morgan Stanley & Co., the giant Wall 
Street investment bank, which is also a major Nasdaq market maker. At that 
moment, Morgan Stanley had the best posted "bid" price for Intuit, offering to 
pay $49.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan declined to fill the order. But for at least 12 minutes after, the firm 
continued to post the $49.25 price, seemingly indicating that it was ready to 
take any legitimate offer at that price, as the firm-quote rule requires. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Tracy Gordon declined to comment on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Though no formal complaint was filed in this case, Morgan Stanley has been the 
target of scores of formal backing-away complaints over the last 12 months. The 
firm says all the complaints are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same morning, a reporter watched as another trader attempted to buy 
1,000 shares of Apple stock from Prudential Securities at Prudential's posted 
asking price of $42.375. Prudential never responded to the computerized 
purchase offer, the trader said. She was forced to wait and try again with 
another firm, ultimately paying $42.75 per share, or a total of $375 more than 
if she had gotten the original price. The trader said the same thing happened 
to her at least six times that day, on orders involving several stocks and 
market makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential spokesman Charles Perkins said he could not find out what happened 
in the Apple trade without more information. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, he said, "every firm is dealing with thousands of orders every 
day. The system recognizes that some trades may get lost on occasion." In this 
case, he noted, the trader did not file a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders say backing away allows for preservation of what they refer to as 
"the club," an inside group of market makers who maintain wide spreads -- the 
gap between the "bid" and "asked" prices that gives market makers their profit. 
</P>
<P>
 By backing away, critics say, these firms are able to trade primarily with 
other market makers they know, while refusing to honor their quoted prices for 
the customers of other firms with which they have no cozy rapport. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, small investors' orders sit unfilled for precious minutes, often 
while prices move to their disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all has to do with whether or not you're in the club," said Arthur W. 
Goldsmith, chief executive of A.J. Michaels & Co., a market maker and trading 
firm on Long Island that has filed many backing-away complaints. "If you're 
not, they never take your order." 
</P>
<P>
 NASD officials call baseless the allegations that Nasdaq practices are 
anything but extremely competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq "is stringently overseen by both the (Securities and Exchange 
Commission) and the NASD, and neither we nor the SEC have ever found 
anti-competitive practices to exist in our market," NASD President Joseph R. 
Hardiman said in a memo written Thursday to market makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Goldsmith spoke of the panicked frustration some traders feel when they 
are trying to sell stock for a customer. They send orders, one after another, 
to the market makers displaying the best quotes. Then they wait, usually 
several minutes between each attempt. In all, it can take 10 minutes or longer 
to execute a trade -- during which time the price of the stock may move 
drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like you're holding a stock and there's no exit," Goldsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, by contrast, trading of each stock is 
centralized in the hands of a single "specialist" firm. The specialist is 
obliged to see that all orders to buy or sell at the prevailing market price 
get filled. So backing away does not exist on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD attributes the upsurge in backing-away complaints to a protest by a 
small group of market makers angry that the NASD cut into their living in 
January by sharply limiting Nasdaq's small-order execution system (known as 
SOES), which had been the basis for these firms' profits. The NASD says the 
firms abused SOES, unfairly using it to take advantage of big market makers who 
were not fast enough in updating their prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a prodigious 85% of the complaints through late June were filed by a 
single small firm that heavily used SOES, Datek Securities of Staten Island, 
N.Y., the NASD says. 
</P>
<P>
 These small firms, in turn, allege that the NASD is ignoring abuses by big 
market makers who routinely violate the firm-quote rule. 
</P>
<P>
 When the NASD scaled back the small-order system, the firms said, they turned 
to using Nasdaq's mainstream trading system, known as SelectNet. But, they 
said, they have discovered that they frequently cannot get their orders filled. 
The reason, they allege, is that the bigger market makers won't honor their 
posted prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at the complaining firms contend that the NASD does little or 
nothing to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have hundreds of backing-away complaints we've filed, but it becomes a 
futile effort," said Michael F. Frey, president of A.J. Michaels. "Nothing ever 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not just the former SOES traders who are complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Keith Balter, head of Nasdaq trading at Weeden & Co. -- and a 
vocal critic of the SOES traders -- said he too has filed backing-away 
complaints when he believed fellow market makers failed to honor quotes. In 
each case, he said, the NASD seemed to do nothing. "We just don't hear 
anything," Balter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by its public statements, the NASD -- which has the power to impose 
large fines and suspend market makers -- means to sternly enforce its 
regulations against backing away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The activity of backing away really goes to the heart of our business," said 
Cangiano, the NASD surveillance chief. "If you get somebody who reneges and is 
not fulfilling the obligations of a market maker, then obviously there are 
serious implications for the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Oct. 4, out of the 4,748 complaints filed this year, the NASD said it 
had disposed of 4,257. Aside from the four fines, the only other action taken 
was to send 81 private warning letters, Cangiano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cangiano said it took only the mildest action because it was persuaded that 
all of the cases were unintentional. Without evidence of repeated violations by 
a trader, he said, the NASD is likely to accept the explanation that the trader 
inadvertently missed seeing an order pop up on the computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll let you go," he said. "We realize everybody is busy, and messages 
scroll off the workstation" without being seen, Cangiano said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Traders say the SelectNet computer system indeed is flawed, making it easy for 
traders who are not paying attention to miss orders. 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda Lerner, general counsel for Domestic Securities, a Suffern, N.Y., 
firm that has filed reams of backing-away complaints, said the NASD is simply 
too willing to believe market makers' claims that unexecuted trades are 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Becker, head of market regulation for the SEC, the federal agency that 
oversees the nation's stock markets, declined to comment on the NASD's handling 
of the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of backing-away complaints obtained by The Times allege a litany of 
abuses, including foul language (a violation of NASD rules), telephones slammed 
down, traders refusing to give their names (also a violation), and lies by 
traders who claimed they had fulfilled their obligation to trade at quoted 
prices by trading with someone else first. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic Securities' parent firm, All-Tech Investment Group Inc., filed more 
than 20 complaints against Morgan Stanley in the first six months of this year. 
In one, All-Tech charged that on March 23, it signaled via SelectNet that it 
wanted to sell 500 shares of Tele-Communications Inc. at Morgan Stanley's 
posted bid price of $23.50. 
</P>
<P>
 All-Tech alleged that Morgan Stanley simply ignored the order. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called after a minute of waiting (for a reply via computer) and they hung 
up on us," says the complaint, signed by All-Tech principal Mark Shefts. "We 
called a second time; the trader refused to give his name but stated: 'Take it 
up with our legal department. Don't bother us.' They also claimed that there 
was a market maker ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the complaint, Morgan Stanley did not change its quotes for 
another minute -- an indication that the firm was still willing to buy TCI 
stock at $23.50, regardless of any earlier trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Florence A. Davis, Morgan Stanley's director of compliance, said her staff had 
investigated the allegations in this and all the other complaints and come up 
with solid proof that Morgan Stanley had fulfilled its obligation to trade at 
its posted prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not scofflaws at Morgan Stanley," she said. "The documentary evidence 
is so black-and-white." But Davis declined repeated requests by The Times to 
see the evidence, saying the complaints had been thoroughly reviewed by the 
NASD.

the Nasdaq computer system for buying or selling a stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bid: The posted price at which a market maker is willing to buy a stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Asked: The posted price at which a market maker is willing to sell a stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spread: The gap between the bid and asked prices. This is essentially the 
market maker's profit margin for acting as a dealer in the stock. Market makers 
buy from investors at the bid and sell at the higher, asked price. 
</P>
<P>
 * Specialists: Firms that handle all orders for a particular stock on the New

</P>
<P>
 * Market makers: Firms that put up their own capital to "make a market" in 
particular Nasdaq stocks, acting as dealers by continuously posting prices for 
the stocks on Nasdaq's computer and standing ready to buy or sell. Unlike NYSE 
specialists, which serve as the sole market maker for each stock, each Nasdaq 
stock has multiple market makers. About This Series 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic Nasdaq market has grown into the nation's busiest marketplace 
for buying and selling stocks, with higher trading volume than the better-known 
New York Stock Exchange. Nasdaq is where investors trade shares of Intel, 
Microsoft, MCI, Apple Computer and other leading firms, along with those of 
hundreds of smaller companies. 
</P>

GUEST VIEW / PAUL KRUGMAN; KATHLEEN BROWN OFFERS SOUND PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA 
TURNAROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL KRUGMAN, EDITOR'S NOTE: Last Sunday, The Times published a column by 
Michael J. Boskina Times Board of Advisers member and Stanford University 
economics professordefending Gov. Pete Wilson's economic record. Today, The 
Times publishes a column by Boskin's Stanford colleague, economist Paul 
Krugman, endorsing Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown's economic program. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's term in office has coincided with the worst slump in the 
history of the California economy. Between July, 1990, and the end of last 
year, California lost about 600,000 jobs; over the same period, the rest of the 
American economy added more than a million and a half jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson claims, of course, that the California recession wasn't his fault. The 
truth is that he hasn't mattered, not having done much -- although you can bet 
that he would be claiming credit if the state's economy were thriving. But the 
real question for voters is whether Wilson has what it takes to lead California 
back to enduring prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 To be an effective economic leader, a governor must have three qualities. 
First, he or she must be a realist -- someone who can both face the facts and 
be honest with the voters. Second, the governor must understand the state's 
economy -- really understand it, not spout ideological slogans that have little 
to do with business reality. Finally, we need a governor who has a plan for the 
state's future, and who shows some faith in the ability of Californians to turn 
their economy around. 
</P>
<P>
 After four years of Pete Wilson, we have plenty of evidence on which to judge 
him on these essential qualities. He simply doesn't pass muster. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with the problem of realism. Wilson has spent his whole term governing a 
state with a slumping economy, yet until a few months before the election he 
behaved like a man who believed that the problems would disappear if he kept 
his eyes shut. For example, when Wilson was inaugurated, it was already obvious 
to governors across America that the end of the Cold War would mean sharp 
cutbacks in defense industries, and most states with large defense-related 
employment had already started to plan for the transition. But Wilson vetoed 
efforts to provide assistance for defense conversion; he even vetoed efforts to 
set up task forces to study new uses for military bases. Not until September, 
1993, did he sign a plan to aid defense conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Or consider Wilson's budgets. Year after year, he has sent down budgets that 
pretend to be balanced, when everyone knows that they are really deeply in 
deficit. This year he has done it again. His latest budget is "balanced" with 
such gimmicks as claiming billions of dollars of federal aid he knew he 
wouldn't get. As state treasurer, Kathleen Brown demanded Wilson take an honest 
approach: Admit there is a deficit and establish a plan to balance the budget 
over several years. But Wilson prefers to offer fiscal fantasies and to pay the 
price -- a lower credit rating, and higher costs for state financing, than 
California deserves or can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more important than Wilson's unwillingness to face reality is his skewed 
vision of the California economy. Ask Wilson and his advisers what is wrong 
with the state's business climate and they have only one answer, repeated over 
and over again: "High taxes and excessive regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nobody would deny that the burdens of taxes and regulations plan an 
important role in business decisions about where to locate. Never mind that the 
overall burden of taxes in California can be controlled only by a governor with 
a realistic plan for spending cuts, which Brown has and Wilson does not, or 
that governors aren't just supposed to complain about regulations. They are 
supposed to propose plans to reduce the red tape, which Brown has and Wilson 
hasn't. The larger point is that taxes and regulations are only part of what 
makes for a good business climate, and Wilson doesn't seem to understand this 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, what was the basis of California's past prosperity? Was it a 
government that did nothing but build prisons? Of course not. California's 
prosperity was built on the foundation of superb public services -- on the 
nation's best school system, from kindergarten through to its great public 
universities; a system of roads, ports, water supplies, that was the wonder of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are now wasting assets. Today, most surveys find that the quality of 
basic education in California is below the national average and that the 
quality of infrastructure is in the bottom third of American states. And most 
surveys of business find that it is this deterioration in the quality of public 
services, not taxes and regulations, that is the main deterrent to adding jobs 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be hard work to restore the quality of public schools and services in 
California, especially when everyone except the governor is willing to admit 
that the budget is deeply in deficit. Still, as a first step, the governor must 
understand that the quality of public service matters. Wilson doesn't 
understand this. Brown does. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if we slash education far enough and let the quality of our 
infrastructure deteriorate enough, we won't have to worry about immigration 
from Third World economies -- we'd already be a Third World economy ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And this brings us to the final point about Wilson: his lack of a vision for 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is one overwhelming characteristic of the Wilson Administration, it 
is its negativism -- its unwillingness to do anything for the state economy 
except under overwhelming political pressure. If a big company threatens to 
move some jobs out of the state unless it gets a special tax break, the Wilson 
Administration snaps to attention. But if someone like Kathleen Brown proposes 
a modest, sensible set of tax incentives for the new small businesses that are 
the state's best chance for future job growth, the idea is dismissed as too 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 For a sitting governor, Wilson has been astonishingly willing to bad-mouth his 
own state. In 1991, he declared that California's business climate "stinks"; in 
1992, he said, "I believe in merchandising California, but you can't sell a bad 
product." But he was the governor; why didn't he propose anything to change the 
situation? 
</P>
<P>
 There is a political method to Wilson's negativism. Clearly, his strategy is 
to deny as many of the state's problems as he can, blame the rest on his 
predecessors and hope that nobody notices the bankruptcy of his position until 
after the election. Let's not let him get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown has a sound, written plan to turn California's economy around. 
I join more than 50 California economists, including my two Nobel laureate 
colleagues at Stanford -- Kenneth Arrow and William Sharpe -- and hundreds of 
business leaders across California in endorsing Kathleen Brown's economic plan.

HUGHES WORKERS GET PREPARED FOR THE WORST; DEFENSE: FULLERTON PLANT'S CLOSURE 
BY END OF 1995 MEANS TRANSFERS AND 800 TO 1,000 LAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's white-knuckle time at Hughes Aircraft's moribund plant here. 
</P>
<P>
 Pink slips -- called "at-risk" notices here -- are starting to go out at the 
huge Fullerton complex, which will close by the end of next year. At least 15 
union workers and an undisclosed number of salaried employees have been told in 
recent days that they will get the ax by Christmas. Scores of more layoff 
notices are expected to be issued in the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Nov. 11, most workers will also learn where they will be transferred to 
and when, according to a company memo from Ken Dahlberg, a senior Hughes 
executive in Fullerton. The 37-year-old plant employs 6,800 people, but Hughes 
said in mid-September that the facility's closure would mean layoffs for 800 to 
1,000 workers and transfers for most of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling Hughes complex, built on 350 acres in the sloping hills of 
Fullerton, employed 15,000 workers in the mid-1980s. In its 37-year history, 
the plant has been a major supplier of air-defense systems, and surface and 
anti-submarine radar systems for the Navy. But employment has been eviscerated 
by post-Cold War defense cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Of more than two dozen buildings at the campus-like site, only two leased 
facilities will remain open, with up to 1,000 workers. Most of the rest of the 
Fullerton workers will be transferred to Hughes plants in El Segundo and Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Hughes workers in Fullerton have already bolted, having concluded it 
is better to leave than to risk an uncertain future or endure more stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Rex Ford, a union steward, says the last few months have been "unbearable." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of (workers) came to me, scared, and they don't know what they're going 
to do. Everybody's in tears. There's just too much gloom." 
</P>
<P>
 So earlier this month, Ford, 36, turned in his union card, leaving with 5 1/2 
weeks of severance pay (about $2,600 before taxes) and $1,000 in tuition 
reimbursement -- which Ford will use to get training for a job in the medical 
field. "I feel a lot less stress now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 workers at the plant are taking a different exit at the end of 
this month: retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading that long list is Louis H. Kurkjian, a 38-year veteran of Hughes. He 
and Dahlberg are the two corporate vice presidents who manage the Fullerton 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 At 59, Kurkjian is six years shy of the corporation's mandatory retirement 
age, but he is leaving, he says, to spend more time with his family. "I wanted 
to balance my time and enjoy my grandkids as they grow," said Kurkjian, who 
will remain as a consultant to Hughes.  
</P>
<P>
 Kurkjian and others in the retirement group took the plunge partly to get in 
on the favorable pension premium rate before it changes on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' retirement benefits are based on an interest rate set by the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that insures pension plans. In most 
cases, retirement payments go down when that interest rate goes up, which is 
the case this year. So by retiring by Nov. 1 -- when the pension plan is 
adjusted to reflect the latest interest rate -- workers can capture the higher 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has some influence," said Bock Louie, a scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Louie is 55 and has 22 years of service at Hughes. That combination qualifies 
him for the so-called Hughes Magic 75 club, whose members get full retirement 
benefits and company-paid health insurance for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Louie says he has been contemplating retirement for the last two years, partly 
so he can spend more time with his elderly parents in Sacramento, where Louie 
is from. When the plant's closure was confirmed, that was enough to tip the 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just time to leave," he said. "From my perspective, Hughes has been a 
great company," he added. "All the projects I've worked on. . . . I don't have 
any complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 The large number of retirements from Fullerton, however, isn't likely to mean 
fewer layoffs. When Hughes announced it would shut down its facilities and sell 
its valuable 350-acre land in Fullerton as part of a corporate streamlining, 
officials said unconditionally that there would be a layoff of 4,400 workers 
companywide -- of which Fullerton's share is between 800 and 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on track to meet that number," said Hughes spokesman Richard Dore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As has been Hughes' practice in the past, those in Fullerton targeted for 
layoffs will first get at-risk notices, or warnings that their jobs are in 
jeopardy. Then four weeks later, they will receive pink slips with another four 
weeks' notice. That's eight weeks' warning altogether, meaning many will be out 
the door around Christmastime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, Merry Christmas, you know," scoffed Scott Sechman, a technician whose 
days are numbered. Despite 14 years at the plant, he lacks the union seniority 
to survive the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers are trying to influence their fates. Employees at the group that 
makes sonar display systems for ships, originally slated to go to Tuscon, have 
submitted a proposal that they be relocated to Long Beach instead. Senior 
management is now said to be considering that plan, but company officials won't 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But all most workers can do is wait and formulate a swirl of plans. Take 
systems engineer Curtis Henderson, who said: "We have considered moving. We are 
also going to try commuting if we get sent to El Segundo, but we will have to 
leave our three kids at day care longer. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 With employees thus preoccupied, work at the plant has naturally slowed down. 
"There are a lot of outbreaks of discussion," remarked one employee. Said 
another: "Morale is pretty bad, some people are in denial." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurkjian, the senior executive, conceded that there are pockets of lagging 
production. But on the whole, he said, "the work ethic is back in place." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that's true or not, one place that is bustling is Building 606, where 
the federally-funded career center has been established for laid-off workers. 
On Friday, the center hosted a job fair by Ingram Micro Inc., a Santa Ana-based 
distributor of personal computers. Ingram officials have told Hughes job 
counselors that they are looking to hire up to 200 Hughes workers by year's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes workers are also getting additional job-search aid, plus counseling 
from psychologists and motivational speakers sponsored by various employee 
forums that represent the interests of Asians, Latinos, African Americans, 
women and veterans at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 About 27% of the 6,800 employees at the Fullerton site are minorities, 
according to company figures. And three of 10 are women. About one-third of the 
workers are engineers, the rest in production, finance, clerical and other 
supporting capacities. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversity figures to be a factor in layoffs and transfers because, as a 
federal government contractor, Hughes is required to be an affirmative action 
employer. But for Hughes' protection against legal action, those accepting the 
layoff benefits must first sign a waiver that they will not sue the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurkjian says Hughes has made cutbacks in the past "as gracefully as it 
could," and he believes the company will try harder this time. Although the 
current severance package isn't up to par with past layoffs, Kurkjian said GM 
Hughes Electronics, the parent of Hughes Aircraft, is striving harder to place 
Fullerton workers at other company divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurkjian said he, too, was pained by Fullerton's shutdown -- a decision he had 
little to do with. "It hurts because I grew up here," said Kurkjian, who came 
to Fullerton in 1959, two years after the plant opened. "But as painful as it 
is, this is the right decision for the company and for the people," he said, 
adding that without this step, "we would risk losing more jobs in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Kurkjian says his decision to retire -- which he told Hughes 
management in August -- was purely for personal reasons. But he adds a sober 
note: "I think we all recognize the world has changed. Hughes is a microcosm of 
what's happening in the aerospace industry."

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: BUSINESS PROFESSOR MAKES A NAME FOR HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The next time somebody asks you to name a business professor who has actually 
succeeded as an investor, you can mention Samuel Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart runs the Wasatch Advisors group of funds in Salt Lake City and is one 
of the relatively few finance professors to make a name for himself as a mutual 
fund manager. 
</P>
<P>
 His Wasatch Aggressive Equity Fund, the company's flagship, has beaten the 
broad stock market over the last five years and enjoys an above-average, 
four-star rating from Morningstar Inc. of Chicago. The November issue of Worth 
magazine calls it the best small-cap growth fund around. 
</P>
<P>
 What's interesting about Stewart isn't just that he has successfully practiced 
what he preaches. Also notable is that his active stock-picking management 
style runs counter to the passive, indexing approach that has been popular 
within academic circles for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Academics aren't very heavy into security analysis," Stewart said. He feels 
there are pockets of inefficiency despite the so-called efficient-markets 
theory, a belief that it's tough to beat the market because prices already 
reflect the universal body of knowledge and expectations about a particular 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some question why anyone would want to waste time on stock research," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But research stocks he does, and he follows an earnings-oriented growth 
approach, in contrast to the bargain-hunting value style that's more popular in 
the academic world. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stewart also focuses on smaller companies, which scholars agree are 
less-efficiently priced (because fewer professional analysts follow them) and 
thus more likely to yield bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart is unusual in other ways too. For starters, he's one of the few fund 
managers who actually spent some time working on the other side of the fence -- 
as a regulator for the Securities and Exchange Commission early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 And because his shareholder base in and around Utah includes quite a few 
Mormons, Stewart runs Aggressive Equity and three other Wasatch funds with an 
eye on avoiding "sinful" stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll generally stay away from certain types of stocks such as tobacco, 
alcohol and gambling companies because we know enough shareholders wouldn't 
like them," said Stewart, a Mormon himself. 
</P>
<P>
 His current favorite holdings include United Asset Management, a mutual fund 
firm; Loewen Group, a funeral home chain; and furniture retailer Heilig-Meyers. 
Stewart likes to buy profitable, growing companies when they're warm rather 
than hot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We follow a growth style but we're not high-turnover or momentum players," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the fund is an aggressive- growth product, which means it will take 
investors on plenty of roller-coaster rides. As a case in point, the fund has 
suffered double-digit quarterly losses on three separate occasions since the 
crash of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund is "definitely not for granny," said Morningstar analyst A. Jason 
Windawi, who points to its high concentration in volatile health-care and 
technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Aggressive Equity has outperformed the Standard & Poor's 
500 index by an average of seven percentage points annually over the last five 
years, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the fund's advantages is managerial consistency," Windawi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Wasatch is headquartered in Salt Lake City, hardly a mutual fund 
capital, is another unusual aspect. But Stewart feels he's well-served staying 
far away from the Wall Street rumor mill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being insulated from the (investment) stories in Salt Lake City allows us to 
remain more long-term oriented," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the main disadvantage of geographic isolation isn't so critical these 
days with the tremendous advances in telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because Stewart and company are off the beaten path, the Aggressive 
Equity portfolio has been slow to attract investors. The fund has doubled in 
size within the past year but still counts only about $50 million in assets. 
Three other Wasatch funds -- a growth, income and mid-cap portfolio -- have a 
mere $20 million combined. 
</P>
<P>
 All four Wasatch funds (800-551-1700) are no-commission products. Wasatch 
Aggressive Growth's annual expense ratio of 1.5% is about average for its peer 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his stints as SEC regulator and mutual fund manager, Stewart worked for 
three years as an assistant professor of finance at Columbia University in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 He later moved to the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, where he continues 
to teach investment classes part time. Two of his four research analysts at 
Wasatch are former students at Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 While Stewart may not fit the classic business professor mold, he certainly 
doesn't turn his back on his academic training. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing I got from the academic world is this: Anytime you get a great 
stock idea, assume that others know about it and have reflected that knowledge 
in its price," he said. 
</P>

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: HOW TO GO ABOUT CHOOSING A FINANCIAL 
PLANNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The financial planning business is booming -- and changing -- thanks to an 
increasingly complex investment environment, societal changes and worries about 
the long-term viability of the nation's cornerstone retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade, the business of financial planning has nearly tripled in 
size -- roughly 28,000 individuals now boast the "certified financial planner" 
label, compared to fewer than 10,000 a decade ago. And where the industry was 
once dominated by small mom-and-pop shops, where the principals made their 
living by selling financial products on commission, today's CFPs are just as 
likely to be working for a large law or accounting firm and billing by the 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 For consumers looking for seasoned financial advice, the changes present both 
challenges and opportunities. With more choices than ever, it pays to know the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you choose a financial planner? 
</P>
<P>
 First, you need to understand a little bit about the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial planners can be divided into three basic categories, differentiated 
by the way the planner is paid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some planners are paid solely through commissions. You pay nothing for their 
advice, but the planner is likely to recommend investments that pay him or her 
a commission, such as so-called load mutual funds, insurance and limited 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fee-only planners charge by the hour or, in some cases, by the job. As a 
result, you could pay $1,000 or more to have a fee-only adviser create a 
financial blueprint for you and your family. 
</P>
<P>
 * A third group is paid both through commissions and fees. These planners 
typically charge a lower rate to draw up a comprehensive plan, but they are 
also likely to recommend some commission-paying investments. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no one type of planner who's best for all people. While some people 
prefer fee-only planners because they get conflict-free advice, others prefer 
commission-only planners because they don't have to pay by the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 1994 study by the College of Financial Planning, 33% of the 
planners surveyed earned their living solely through commissions, 35% combined 
fees and commissions, and 18% worked on a fee-only basis. The remaining 14% 
earned a combination of salaries and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, you need to know what you're looking for. Do you want someone to draw 
up a plan that will simply help you save for retirement or your children's 
college expenses? Or do you want a comprehensive plan that details your short- 
and long-term goals, provides a blueprint for your investments, saves taxes and 
offers estate planning techniques? 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the answer to that question will help you interview potential planners 
more effectively. You'll know to ask whether the planner has expertise in the 
areas you're most interested in. And you'll be better able to compare price -- 
yes, price comparisons are possible -- because you'll be making 
apples-to-apples comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The median cost of a comprehensive financial plan is $950, according to a 1993 
survey by the College of Financial Planning. But planners prepare far more 
"abbreviated" plans than comprehensive ones. And the cost for an abbreviated 
plan is just $300, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once you know what you want, you should begin to get referrals and interview 
planners. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask friends and relatives for referrals. But if you're not impressed with 
these, get a referral from a professional association. 
</P>
<P>
 The Institute of Certified Financial Planners ((800) 282-7526) will provide 
names, phone numbers and biographical sketches of three certified financial 
planners in your area. All you have to do is ask. CFPs must adhere to strict 
educational and ethical guidelines laid down by the ICFP. 
</P>
<P>
 If you specifically want a fee-only planner, you can get referrals by calling 
the National Assn. of Personal Financial Advisors ((800) 366-2732). 
</P>
<P>
 The final step is interviewing the planner. In addition to chatting about his 
or her background, education and specialties, you should find out if he or she 
is certified and will provide you with sample plans prepared for others in your 
circumstances, as well as a copy of the disclosure statement he or she provides 
to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at the sample plans for two things: First, make sure the plans for 
different people are not close to identical, says Jack Blankinship, partner at 
Blankinship & Foster in Del Mar and president of the Certified Financial 
Planner Board of Standards. Good planners create plans that accommodate a 
client's age, goals, family status and prospects. No two families are exactly 
alike. Their plans ought to be different too. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, see if the plan tells a story. Is it clear? Can you follow what was 
suggested and why? 
</P>
<P>
 The lengthy SEC disclosure form is even more revealing, Blankinship says. It 
describes how the planner is paid, his or her educational background, conflicts 
of interest and whether or not the planner has been upbraided by securities 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 The form is an official document that must be provided to the SEC each year by 
any planner who sells investments. If you read it and understand it, you're far 
more likely to feel comfortable putting your financial affairs in a planner's 
hands.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: 'STARKER EXCHANGE' FOR EXPERTS ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: I am confused about the rules governing the tax-deferred exchange of 
commercial real estate. I am told this process is a "Starker exchange." What is 
this all about? -- M.Q . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Tax-deferred exchanges -- officially called "accommodators" -- are a 
complicated subject and you will probably want to consult an expert before 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Starker exchanges, which took their informal name from a legal case, cover 
only investment properties. The law outlining the requirements is contained in 
Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, and often these transactions are 
also referred to as "1031 exchanges." 
</P>
<P>
 (Tax-deferred sales and repurchases of your primary residence are covered 
under Sect. 1034 of the tax code and are entirely separate from Starker 
exchanges.) 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, a seller has 45 days after the close of escrow on the sale 
of his initial property to identify the real estate he wishes to acquire 
through a tax-deferred exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 He must complete the acquisition of that property within 180 days of the 
escrow closing. Pay attention: the government allows a maximum of a total of 
180 days from the close of escrow on this first property for the completion of 
a tax-deferred exchange. You do not have 45 days to select the property and 
another 180 days in which to complete the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 When you enter escrow for the sale of your initial property, you should advise 
your real estate broker as well as your escrow officer that you intend the 
proceeds of the sale to go into a tax-deferred exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement of your intentions should be included in the official escrow 
instructions. Equally important is the requirement that you never take 
possession of the proceeds from the sale of the initial property. If you do, 
the tax-deferred advantage of the transaction is forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the strict regulations surrounding tax-deferred exchanges, you 
should get help from a qualified third-party "accommodator" before attempting 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Your real estate broker, escrow officer or family attorney should be able to 
steer you to an accountant or lawyer who has been trained to act as an 
accommodator. But be careful: The area is ripe for abuse and you could be out 
of luck if you select an unskilled or unqualified accommodator. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important service the accommodator performs is temporarily taking 
possession both of the property you intend to buy and of the funds you receive 
from the first property sale to insure that you never touch those assets until 
the deal is completed.

<P>
 These are highly sensitive and important duties, and you should be sure to 
interview prospective accommodators carefully before making your selection to 
learn of their experience and qualifications. For additional information, see 
Internal Revenue Service publications No. 17 "Your Federal Income Tax," or No. 
544, "Sales and Other Dispositions of Property." How to Check on Social 
Security 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can a taxpayer find out if all the Social Security contributions that 
have been taken out of her paycheck have been paid to the government, and that 
the government has accurate records of these payments? -- L.J . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is a fairly easy way to find out whether your Social Security account 
is at the level it should be. The same procedure will also tell you how much 
you can expect to receive from Social Security upon retirement. Simply call 
(800) 772-1213 and ask for Social Security Form SSA-7004, "Personal Earnings 
and Benefit Estimate." 
</P>
<P>
 When you get the form, which asks your birth date, Social Security number and 
a few other questions, complete it and mail it back to the enclosed address. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Security Administration will then send you back a listing of your 
Social Security-qualified employment earnings and expected retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think there is an error in the information, you should contact your 
local Social Security office. Be prepared to show agency officials appropriate 
tax returns or earnings statements to support your position. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials say they cannot guarantee that they will be able to correct 
mistakes made more than three years earlier, and that's why they recommend 
filing Form SSA-7004 every three years. How to Figure Capital Loss From 
Reinvesting 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In a recent column you discussed how to figure your losses when selling 
stock that was in part purchased with reinvested dividends. Does it matter 
whether the stock was purchased with reinvested capital gains distributions? -- 
H.F.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: You figure your losses first by computing your total out-of-pocket 
investment -- initial purchase, reinvested dividends and-or reinvested capital 
gains distributions. Now deduct your proceeds from the sale. Then add in any 
broker's commission. The result is your capital loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure your capital gains distributions were reinvested in the shares and 
that you already paid taxes on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Straight cash distributions are not added to your basis unless they are 
reinvested.

PEOPLE: LENTZSCH NAMED PRESIDENT OF GREYHOUND LINES INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Craig Lentzsch, a former executive of Greyhound Lines Inc., was named the new 
president and chief executive of the struggling bus company on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lentzsch, 46, was also elected to the Dallas-based firm's board. He will 
assume the job Nov. 15. He succeeds Frank Schmieder, who resigned in August 
under pressure from Connor, Clark & Co., the Toronto-based investment firm that

 Before joining Greyhound, Lentzsch co-founded BusLease Inc. BusLease was 
merged with Greyhound in 1987 when Lentzsch, P. Anthony Lannie and Fred Currey, 
former chairman and chief executive officer, bought Greyhound form Dial Corp. 
for $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Lentzsch served as vice chairman and executive vice president of Greyhound 
from March, 1987 to December, 1989. He said he left Greyhound because of 
"philosophical differences" with Currey. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Lentzsch acquired the assets of BusLease from Greyhound's estate 
after the company filed for bankruptcy. A year later, the company was sold to 
Motor Coach Industries. Greyhound emerged from Chapter 11 protection in 
October, 1991.

YOUR MORTGAGE; LENDERS FINDING MORE WAYS TO HELP BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you don't own a home because you assume that your income, cash reserves or 
employment history rule you out, think again: Banks, thrift institutions and 
other mortgage lenders literally are rewriting their rule books to get you into 
a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is political pressure from Congress and the Clinton 
Administration to increase their "affordable" lending to first-time and 
moderate-income purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
 But equally important is the realization by lenders that there are profits to 
be made -- safely -- by reaching out to renters who don't believe they qualify 
for a home mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 A new, national study by the Consumer Bankers Assn. provides dramatic 
documentation of just how eager lenders are to stretch their traditional 
guidelines and loan-making practices. Of 130 institutions surveyed across the 
country, fully 96% of those responding have cut their standard down payment 
requirements for moderate-income buyers. The average "affordable housing" down 
payment requirement: Just 4.2%, $4,200 on a $100,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 93% of the lenders responding have also adopted more lenient, 
flexible standards for one of the most crucial ingredients in the mortgage 
process: The ratio of your debts to your income. Although the standard 
"front-end" ratio -- your projected monthly housing payment compared with your 
monthly income -- is 28%, lenders in the study averaged 33% for first-time, 
moderate-income purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
 The same sort of stretch can be seen on their "back-end" ratio requirements -- 
that is, your total monthly debt load (mortgage plus charge accounts, car 
payments, student loans, etc.) -- versus your monthly income. Instead of the 
36% ceiling they've used in their conventional mortgage programs, lenders 
looking for moderate-income purchasers averaged over 39%. That means that with 
a $3,000-a-month income, you could have debts of $1,182 with a bank's more 
flexible rule compared with $1,080 under its traditional standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Other major areas where lenders are trying to bend over backward to work with 
first-time and moderate-income buyers, according to respondents in the study: 
</P>
<P>
 -- More flexible approaches to credit histories. More than 94% of the lenders, 
for instance, said they now look at "alternative" measurements of 
credit-worthiness, such as your rent payments or utility payments. Gone are the 
days where first-time applicants get automatic turndowns because they don't 
have credit cards in their wallets or immaculate credit bureau files. 
</P>
<P>
 -- More accommodating approaches on employment histories. Fully 79% of the 
lenders responding to the survey say they have liberalized their standards 
regarding the length of time in employment, numbers of jobs held during recent 
years and the like. You don't have to demonstrate that you've been in the same 
position -- or the same field -- for an extended period. You do have to 
convince the bank, however, that your income stream from your employment is 
likely to be stable, and that you're not prone to switch jobs every other 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Symbolic of the aggressive outreach efforts by lenders to moderate-income and 
first-time buyers is a national "alternative qualification" program from the 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac). Available as of late September 
through at least seven of the largest-volume mortgage companies in the country, 
the "AQ" program is expressly designed for buyers who would be frozen out of 
homeownership using traditional lending guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The program assigns extra weight to your household cash flow -- the money you 
can demonstrate is coming in -- rather than focusing heavily on your household 
debt load. As proof of your ability to pay your monthly mortgage, lenders using 
AQ look at the rent payments you've been making, among other factors. If you've 
been regularly handing your landlord a check for $900 for the past year, for 
instance, the AQ approach takes that as a good indication that you can afford a 
mortgage payment somewhere in the same neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a hypothetical example supplied by Freddie Mac that shows how a lender 
would use the AQ method to size you up: 
</P>
<P>
 Say your gross annual income is $23,800 and you've got a good credit history. 
Your monthly rent and utilities payments for the last 12 months have been $992. 
Add to that the monthly federal and state income taxes you'll now save from 
mortgage interest deductions ($30) and your documented monthly savings deposit 
history ($25). That gives you $1,047 in potential money to make a mortgage 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtract from that your projected monthly utilities payments ($100), property 
taxes ($100) and hazard insurance ($15), and you come up with a maximum 
allowable principal and interest payment of $832 under the AQ method. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does that compare with traditional loan qualification standards? 
There's a dramatic difference. Using the long-customary 28% housing 
debt-to-household income ratio (excluding taxes and insurance), and you only 
qualify for monthly mortgage payments of $555. That means a considerably 
smaller maximum mortgage amount and a considerably lower-cost house. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line here for renters? Stop thinking you don't qualify to buy a 
house. Mortgage lenders are truly finding more ways to say yes.

PANSIES APLENTY; FLOWERS: LONG-LASTING AND AVAILABLE IN AN ARRAY OF COLORS, 
THESE BEDDING PLANTS ARE FALL FAVORITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have you noticed what's happened to pansies, those demure and diminutive 
fall-planted favorites? Or violas, for that matter, their compact cousins? 
</P>
<P>
 They're not just blue or yellow anymore, even though these two colors are 
still their strong suit. Like a flight of butterflies, they now come in every 
conceivable color, even a non-color, black. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardeners should be delighted because pansies are one of the longest-lasting 
bedding plants, and now there are shades and hues to go with anything else you 
have in the garden or feel like planting this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem may be choosing from so many, compounding the gardener's 
lament of "so many flowers, so little ground" (although they also excel in 
containers). 
</P>
<P>
 One wholesale grower will have 84 kinds of pansies this year and 16 violas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've given up trying to keep track of them," said Frank Burkard Jr., who runs 
Burkard Nurseries in Pasadena, "suddenly there's so much out there." 
</P>
<P>
 He's planted some surprising schemes not possible a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange and black, for instance, for a Halloween garden party, using three 
orange Padparaja pansies for every one black (which are actually a deep, deep 
maroon but look as black as soot). 
</P>
<P>
 He's also mixed the new pinks with pale blues and whites to get a soft Easter 
basket look for springtime. Pastel pink was unheard of in pansies but the new 
Imperial Pink changed that, and there is now a whole series of pastels called 
Imperial Antique Shades that one catalogue calls "difficult to describe" but 
"fashionable." Call them dusky, decidedly non-primary colors, and a hit with 
gardeners who prefer pastels. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several soft apricot hues and peachy colors, even a wild orange and 
purple pansy named Jolly Joker that is no shrinking violet. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pansies are approaching real red, but Burkard cautions "scarlet, maybe 
rose, would better describe them." Frosty Rose is a particularly pretty new 
pansy, but Universal Plus Red comes pretty darn close to being a true bright 
red. And, there are some deep wine reds that must have been aged in good oak 
for a long time. Some are nearly brown. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't overlook the new crisp whites and sugary creams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it amazing what's happened in the last two or three years?" asked 
designer Sandy Kennedy of Kennedy Landscape Design Associates in Woodland 
Hills. Although she says she is "just getting to know them," Kennedy already 
has some favorites for fall planting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masterpiece series is one, full of lavenders, purples, soft yellows and 
peaches, sultry maroons, even bronze. And the flowers on these and another 
debuting strain named Rococo are ruffled, a new twist. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new twist is found in the Bingo and Rally series of pansies. The 
flowers are less droopy with a stronger joint between flower and stem so they 
stand up straight. Both series are new this year. 
</P>
<P>
 She also likes the pale, faceless pansies, like a viola with little or no 
markings but as big as a pansy. They and the new violas with cat-whisker faces 
have completely blurred the distinction between pansy and viola. Nowadays 
violas simply have the smallest flowers, usually an inch or smaller in size, 
and they can be plain or heavily marked. Just about everything larger, plain or 
marked, is called a pansy, though some call the smaller kinds "viola-flowered 
pansies" or "multifloras." To further confuse matters, one grower calls a new 
series of violas "mini-pansies." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kennedy, the faceless pansies and the new violas seem to take 
spring heat better in the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys (the new Maxims 
and Happy Face especially), and Burkard thinks they are less likely to rot. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people, particularly those that garden in heavy clay soil on the east 
side of town, have serious problems with pansies suddenly wilting and dying, 
especially during wet winters. It's caused by a pathogen that thrives in soggy 
soil and attacks the crowns of the plants. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be a maddening experience. Donald Duke, and his father before him, grew 
hundreds of pansies each year in their San Marino garden. A few years ago they 
started dying out and they tried all sorts of things from mounding the soil to 
growing their own from seed, but have finally given up trying at all. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've had this problem in the recent past, you probably will again, said 
Burkard, because the disease is in the soil. Try planting in a different 
location and leave that part of the garden pansy-free for a couple of years, 
like a farmer rotating his crops. 
</P>
<P>
 You should also make sure that the pansies are planted so the crown (the top 
of the root-ball) ends up about a half-inch out of the soil, and go easy on the 
watering. Try switching to the smaller violas. 
</P>
<P>
 Or plant in containers using fresh bagged potting soil. Pansies are a natural 
in containers, perfectly proportioned to pots and they will spill gracefully 
over the sides. In a pot, pansies are virtually problem free. 
</P>
<P>
 Lew Whitney at Roger's Gardens in Newport Beach likes to mix pansies with 
violas, contrasting size as well as color. He only puts one kind in a pot but 
then groups the pots to make a mix such as the one pictured on the front page 
of this section. 
</P>
<P>
 He sometimes plants bulbs in the containers, using a big wood dibble (a 
rounded stick for planting) to punch holes in the soil between plants so he can 
drop in the bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Freesias are a favorite. They smell good and the pansies help them stand up 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
 He also likes to mix Fairy Bouquet linaria with the Antique Shades pansies. 
They have similar colors but while the pansy is low and clumping, the linaria 
is tall and wispy.  
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy thinks pansies are the perfect topping for bulbs planted out in the 
garden. They are especially dramatic over daffodils (and anemones, added 
Whitney). Try pale blue faceless pansies such as the blue Crystal Bowl or the 
Azure Blue from the Crown series. 
</P>
<P>
 Or try using some of the new violas such as the Princess series.  
</P>
<P>
 The time to plant is now. In the ground or in containers, space plants about 
six inches apart (the large Majestic Giants are better at eight inches apart). 
</P>
<P>
 Remember to plant them a little high and be careful not to over-water. Kennedy 
finds that transplants from the larger nursery packs (usually called "color 
packs") do better than those started from the small nursery packs. She also 
likes planting them from four-inch pots but that can get pricey. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love to be fed," said Whitney, and some people keep them dead-headed, 
though the smaller flowered pansies don't seem to need this. 
</P>
<P>
 If they get gangly in early spring (anytime before April), Whitney swears you 
can cut off about two-thirds of the old sprawling growth and they will come 
back stronger than ever.  
</P>
<P>
 Expect them to last a very long time, in the garden or in pots, for an annual 
bedding plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the (San Fernando) Valley, I've planted them in October and had them 
last through April," said Kennedy. That's seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the coast, they can last into July, according to Whitney. That's an 
incredible 10 months. "Pansies give you the most mileage of all fall-planted 
annuals," he said.

HOT PROPERTY; 'BRAT PACKER' SETTLES DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ROB LOWE, who co-stars as the outlaw Jesse James in the upcoming movie "Frank 
and Jesse" and is due to start filming in January in the starring role in the 
BBC six-hour miniseries "Pride and Prejudice," has purchased a Santa Barbara 
home for about $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe, 30, played a deaf mute in Stephen King's miniseries "The Stand," which 
aired in May. He played a doctor in the PBS production of Tennessee Williams' 
"Suddenly Last Summer," which premiered in January, and a retarded man in the 
1987 film "Square Dance," for which he won a Golden Globe nomination. He was 
also in "Wayne's World" (1992). 
</P>
<P>
 A member of a group of young Hollywood movie stars labeled the Brat Pack, he 
co-starred in such movies as "The Outsiders" (1983) and "St. Elmo's Fire" 
(1985) before becoming involved in a 1989 video sex scandal, which he had 
feared might ruin his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, he was quoted as saying that he is back on track after a 
self-destructive period that included heavy drinking. He married makeup artist 
Sheryl Berkoff in 1991, and they had a son last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lowes purchased a Country English-style home in Montecito with four 
bedrooms and three baths in about 4,500 square feet, Santa Barbara sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 ANDREW STEVENS, who appeared in more than two dozen feature films as well as a 
dozen TV movies, five mini-series and half a dozen TV series (including 
"Dallas") before focusing on producing, directing, writing and distributing 
films, has purchased an Encino home for a bit more than $1 million, sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, the 38-year-old son of actress Stella Stevens, was the star and 
creator of the "Night Eyes" video series, and he directed "Grid Runners" and 
"The Skateboard Kid" as well as the upcoming "Skateboard Kid II." He was also 
involved in producing these films. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens and his fiance, Robyn Scott, plan to extensively remodel his new, 
ranch-style home, making it conform to their more traditional tastes. The 
4,600-square-foot home, on about an acre with a pool and tennis court, is 
between several giant oak trees in the heavily wooded Royal Oak Hills area of 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Berry and John Yardum of Jon Douglas Co.'s Bel-Air office represented 
Stevens in buying the home, which was originally listed, a year ago, at just 
under $1.7 million. Don Underwood and Harriet Cameron of Fred Sands, Sherman 
Oaks, represented the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL DINNER, who directed the February TV movie "Rise and Walk: The Dennis 
Byrd Story" (about the New York Jets player who broke his neck) and was 
co-executive producer and director of many episodes of the Emmy Award-winning 
series "The Wonder Years," has put his four-bedroom home in Mandeville Canyon 
on the market at $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He is planning to move to a larger home in Bel-Air, because he got married, 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner has owned the 2,200-square-foot Brentwood home, which looks like a big 
treehouse, for the past three years. The house was built in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 David Gray of Jon Douglas Co., Beverly Hills, has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas house that JOSE and KITTY MENENDEZ were building when they were 
murdered in their Beverly Hills home in 1989 has closed escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not overbid in court, and the couple who bid slightly more than $1.3 
million before the September probate hearing are now the new owners, said the 
attorney who handled the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The last asking price for the 8,000-square-foot mansion, on 14 acres, was 
$1,925,000, according to the attorney, Stephen Goldberg of Spierer & Woodward, 
Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The home was originally listed for sale, three years ago, at more than $3 
million, another source has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers of the 230-acre Brentwood Country Estates, owned by hotelier BARRON 
HILTON and his family, have sold their first lot in the gated Mandeville Canyon 
project, which opened sales two years ago in the $2-million range. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hiltons also plan to use two of the 14 home sites in their project to 
build, "on spec," two 7,000-square-foot houses, each of which will be priced in 
the $4-million range, said Rodrigo Iglesios of Rodeo Realty, who is handling 
sales with Rick Hilton of Hilton & Hyland, Beverly Hills. The buyer of the lot 
has been described as a banker from Mexico.

TIPS FOR HANDLING NOISY NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORA JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 2 a.m. You're trying to sleep. You feel a pounding sensation in your 
head. At first, you think it's a headache. But then you realize it's the funky 
disco beat blasting from your next-door neighbor's stereo, reverberating 
through your bedroom and rattling your windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you pound on the neighbor's door and yell something you'll regret or, 
even worse, resign yourself to living with the noise, try some more 
constructive alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Talk to Your Neighbor 
</P>
<P>
 Your first step is to talk to your neighbor and try to resolve your 
differences in person. It's hard to believe, but sometimes neighbors are not 
aware that they are causing a disturbance. Even if you're ready to punch 
somebody's lights out, try a little sugar instead. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Get a Copy of Your Local Ordinance 
</P>
<P>
 Your next step is to get a copy of your local noise laws. Most cities and 
counties have ordinances that control the times, types and loudness of noise. 
For example, many local ordinances prohibit unreasonable vehicle noise (like 
honking the car horn early every morning for a car pool) or dogs barking all 
night long every night. 
</P>
<P>
 Noisy neighbors are in for a warning or even a fine. You can look up your 
local ordinance at city hall, a public law library or the public library. Make 
at least two copies of it, one for your neighbor and one for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Warn Your Neighbor in Writing 
</P>
<P>
 If things don't improve, ask your neighbor again -- this time in writing -- to 
quiet down. Don't make threats, but state that if the situation doesn't improve 
you'll be forced to notify the authorities. Enclose a copy of the noise 
ordinance. Keep a copy of your letter; you'll need it if, as a last resort, you 
later sue your neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Suggest Mediation 
</P>
<P>
 Most cities offer free or low-cost mediation services, which means they 
provide an impartial mediator who will sit down with you and your neighbor and 
try to help you resolve your differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Just call the mediation service; someone there will contact the neighbor and 
suggest mediation. (These people are very good at convincing others to give 
mediation a chance.) 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Call the Police 
</P>
<P>
 If you have done all of the above and your neighbor has responded by turning 
up the volume, now is the time to call the police (or the Animal Control 
officer if the problem is a barking dog). Try to get the police to come while 
the noise is occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you can call the police on a noisy neighbor the first time the 
music gets too loud for your taste. But the police will be more sympathetic to 
your situation if they see that you have tried to solve the problem on your 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- Sue for Nuisance 
</P>
<P>
 If all else fails, you can get your neighbor's attention -- and maybe some 
money -- by suing in Small Claims Court. You can sue your neighbor for nuisance 
if your neighbor's noise unreasonably interferes with your enjoyment of your 
property. In the lawsuit, you ask for money to compensate you for the 
interference with your right to peacefully enjoy your home. 
</P>
<P>
 Small Claims Court is easy and inexpensive, and you don't need a lawyer. You 
will need to show the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is excessive and disturbing noise. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Your enjoyment of your property is diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You have asked the person to stop the noise (your letter should be enough 
to prove this). 
</P>
<P>
 To prove your case, you can use police reports, witnesses, recordings, your 
own testimony and the testimony of neighbors or other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 California quitters who share these attitudes are not the sort of people 
likely to bring economic dynamism to neighboring states. The amount you'll want 
to ask for will depend on how much the noise bothered you. Did you lose sleep? 
Were you unable to carry on your usual activities, such as reading, playing 
music or talking to friends? Decide on a reasonable dollar amount per day, and 
multiply that figure by the number of days you've been seriously bothered. The 
amount of money you can ask for in Small Claims Court is limited to $5,000 in 
California.

TIPS FOR HANDLING NOISY NEIGHBORS; IF YOU'RE A TENANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORA JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Noisy neighbors are always bad news. But when you share walls with an 
insensitive neighbor, the problem is especially vexing. The good news for 
renters is that, in addition to all your other options, you have built-in 
allies in the battle to keep your apartment livable: your lease or rental 
agreement and your landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the lease or rental agreement you signed? Chances are your neighbor 
signed one too. Standard leases and rental agreements contain clauses that 
entitle you to "quiet enjoyment" of your home. A neighbor who is blasting the 
stereo in an unreasonable manner is probably violating the lease or rental 
agreement and can be evicted for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 If you warn your neighbor about the noise in writing and are sure that your 
lease entitles you to a reasonable amount of quiet, send a copy of the lease 
along with your letter. In your letter, tell the neighbor that the next 
complaint will be to the landlord or neighborhood association if the noise 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 If warning your neighbor doesn't work, go to your landlord. Most tenants don't 
like to complain to the landlord or manager about unreasonable noise or other 
nuisances because they are afraid of being branded as troublemakers. But other 
neighbors are probably bothered by the noise too. Get together with them and 
complain to the landlord as a group. It's easier and you might get faster 
results. Most landlords don't want arguments between tenants and won't put up 
with tenants who cause trouble by ignoring signed lease or rental agreements. 
Your landlord will probably tell the noisy tenant to pipe down or face 
eviction. CORA JORDAN

OBITUARIES; THOMAS BEGLEY; COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE BROKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Martin Begley, a longtime commercial real estate broker and son of the 
late actor Ed Begley, has died at a convalescent hospital here, his son 
announced Friday. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
 A Van Nuys resident since 1948, Begley died Thursday at Beverly Manor 
Convalescent Hospital following a lengthy illness, Tim Begley said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1948, following a stint as an Army soldier in the Pacific during World War 
II, Begley moved to California from his native Connecticut and began a career 
as a salesman, working for a variety of clients. 
</P>
<P>
 He entered the real estate industry in 1962, selling and leasing commercial 
property for Forrest E. Olson. During a career that lasted nearly 30 years, 
Begley's clients included such companies as Papermate and Fedco. He retired in 
the early 1990s due to poor health, his son said. 
</P>
<P>
 Born July 17, 1923 in Hartford, Conn., Begley spent much of his early life in 
Connecticut, appearing occasionally with his famous father on radio and 
television. He was also an accomplished tap dancer as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a very sharp wit," his first wife, Marie, said Friday. "He loved to 
play jokes on people." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son Tim, Begley is survived by his wife of 17 years, Inga; 
another son, Tom Begley Jr., of Canyon Country; three daughters, Karen 
Felthoven of Denver, Sharon Mineo of Van Nuys, and Marie Icenogle of Newhall; a 
brother, actor Ed Begley Jr. of Studio City; a sister, Ailene Curto of 
Springfield, Mass.; 13 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held Monday at 3 p.m. at the Northridge home of Tim 
Begley. For more information, call Begley at (818) 368-0290.

HEED CSUN STUDENT VOTE ON SPORTS; QUAKE-DAMAGED UNIVERSITY SHOULD RECONSIDER 
COMMITMENT TO INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at Cal State Northridge sent a message Wednesday when they voted down 
the second attempt this year to pass a referendum that would have increased 
fees allocated to the school's sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
 True, only 4,431 students participated in the telephone balloting. But that's 
more than the number of students who attend home team football games. It's also 
more than twice the number of students who participated in the last referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 We also question the supposed closeness of Wednesday's tally, with 2,315 
against the increase in fees for athletics (to $49 per semester), and 2,116 in 
favor of it. Had not administrators and athletes performed a full-court press 
in arguing for the increase, it probably wouldn't have been as close as it was. 
It's also safe to argue that many of the older and job-holding students who 
didn't vote didn't attach much significance to the needs of the athletic 
department in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact of the matter is that CSUN had been in a posture of scaling back its 
overall offerings, with cutbacks in classes and faculty, before the Northridge 
quake . The temblor wrecked its library, administration buildings and 
classrooms. Enrollment stands at its lowest level in 21 years, and many 
classrooms are still being held in trailers. The rebuilding effort is slow and 
students are edgy about it. Under such circumstances, we're not sure why anyone 
expected success in asking students to cough up a 12-fold fee increase for 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Its defeat now leads to inevitable questions. Early on in her tenure, for 
example, CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson agreed to retain the school football 
program and to keep other athletic programs at the Division I level. The 
decision on football in particular has been further complicated by the fact 
that the California State University system has agreed to parity in men's and 
women's sports as part of a legal settlement with the National Organization for 
Women. 
</P>
<P>
 As painful as it might be, the time has come for Wilson and the CSUN community 
to scale down the school's lofty commitment to intercollegiate athletics, and 
football in particular.

STORY BESMIRCHES A DEDICATED PHYSICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to register my complete disgust with your article "Patient Says 
Physician Sexually Abused Her" (Oct. 7). You managed to devote almost 20 column 
inches for a non-story that is just a series of allegations.How do you 
determine the size of this type of an article -- five inches if it was a nurse, 
10 inches if it was a doctor, 20 inches if you are a pillar of the community? 
Is this a new philosophy of the L.A. Times -- the more you have done for the 
community, the bigger the smear? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't you get it? This is how people create lawsuits. If this person can get 
any official agency to cast doubt on what happened, then the attorneys will 
appear and the insurance company will settle. 
</P>
<P>
 You are capable of much better than this. Shame on you.

<P>
 It is damaging to a gentleman that has been both a dedicated physician and a 
hard-working member of his community for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Herdeg will be forever besmirched due to your article, even if he is found 
innocent or the woman drops the charges today. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize you have an obligation to report the news, and that maybe the law is 
at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's identity is shielded by the law, when it is by no means proved 
that she is telling the truth. Why isn't the doctor entitled to the same 
anonymity until his innocence or guilt is established?

CELLULAR PHONE SCAM GOES BY THE NUMBERS; PROTECTIVE MEASURES CAN WARD OFF 
CLONING'S PERPETRATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, you would love to enjoy the convenience and the security of having a 
cellular phone, but find the costs somewhat burdensome or prohibitive. Well, 
talk loudly and often enough about it and someone just might surface who will 
offer you a deal that seems too good to pass up. Take our advice, and pass. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened recently to a busy young woman who is working her way through 
college. She wasn't suspicious when the two fellows who sold her the telephone 
kept forgetting to give her the unit's telephone number and told her she 
shouldn't give it to anyone anyway. ("Too many people will call you and it will 
get expensive," they said.) She wasn't suspicious about the low-cost payment 
arrangement, in which she just paid the guys and never received a bill in the 
mail. She wasn't even suspicious when the telephone repeatedly failed to 
function after only a few days of use. She just took it back to the guys, who 
fiddled with it and made it work again . . . for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 This otherwise intelligent woman was an unwitting participant in the 
$300-million-a-year cellular telephone fraud crime wave. This particular gambit 
is known as "repeat business." The dupe is sold a cell phone that was either 
stolen or bought at a discount. The telephone has been programmed with an 
Electronic Serial Number (ESN) already owned by a legitimate cellular phone 
user. That, as Times reporters Chip Johnson and Adam S. Bauman point out, makes 
the illegal unit a "clone phone." 
</P>
<P>
 She was never given a number for her unit because the legitimate owners of the 
number would be receiving her return calls. She never received a bill for her 
calls for the same reason. The phone service on her unit was repeatedly 
interrupted after a few days because the legitimate owners were getting the 
bill, reporting the fraud, and getting new telephone numbers. Those of you who 
have received huge cellular phone bills filled with calls you never made know 
what we mean. 
</P>
<P>
 When she took the unit back to the sellers, they kept putting someone else's 
ESN on it -- maybe yours. 
</P>
<P>
 In a crackdown on such operations, Glendale police detectives recently 
arrested the two owners of an electronics store on La Cienega Boulevard in what 
may be one of the biggest cellular phone fraud operations ever in Southern 
California. Police say they confiscated more than 100 clone phones and the 
computer equipment needed to create them. 
</P>
<P>
 It is estimated that a quarter of the cellular telephone calls made in the Los 
Angeles area are made from counterfeit phones. That's something to think about 
when you consider that the countermeasures necessary to interdict such crime 
will only make the service more expensive, and more complicated to use. It's 
also something to think about if you ever make a police emergency 911 call from 
your cell phone, and get a "system busy" signal because illegal calls are 
jamming up the air time. 
</P>
<P>
 What should you do to protect yourself, and help detect fraud? We have a few 
answers from the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lock your car phone, or remove the handset and the antenna when you leave 
your car unattended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep your subscriber agreement, which includes your electronic serial 
number, in a private place. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carefully check your monthly bill for unfamiliar numbers and report them to 
your cellular phone company. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you frequently receive hang-up calls or wrong number calls, report it. It 
may mean that your number has been tapped by a clone user. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have your cellular provider eliminate long-distance dialing capabilities if 
you only use it for local calls. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you acquired your cellular phone through one of those "don't pay the 
phone company, just pay us" kind of deals, turn the phone in and the person who 
sold it to you. You have been unwittingly participating in a felony crime in 
California.

SAN FERNANDO'S RIDICULOUS LEASE LAW; ORDINANCE REQUIRING VOTE ON RENTING OUT 
CITY PROPERTY SHOULD BE REPEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The building at 120 MacNeil St. in the city of San Fernando has no special 
historical significance. It is not an engineering marvel. It does not rest upon 
a slice of real estate that is especially valuable, and it's safe to say that 
it will never make the cover of Architectural Digest. Ah, but in the annals of 
American politics in general, and California balloting in particular, it may be 
unique. 
</P>
<P>
 Where else but at this not-so-hallowed address do voters have to waste 
precious tax dollars every time the city government and its elected officials 
want to lease the space? 
</P>
<P>
 You heard that right. There are 2.4 square miles in this naked city, and this 
is the only address with its own ordinance decreeing that any lease or rental 
agreement or sale has to first be approved directly by the voters. So said 
Proposition L, first supported by enough of the city's 5,920 voters to become 
law back in 1986 and narrowly upheld in a challenge in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of its enactment, it was (of course) supported by a member of the 
City Council who has since been defeated at the polls. That former member, 
Carmillas M. Noltemeyer, said it was necessary to mitigate "the poor decisions 
of the San Fernando City Council" involving the old police station at 120 
MacNeil. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that makes a lot of sense. If the city government and its elected 
officials can't be trusted with one piece of real estate, how can they be 
trusted with any of it? And the political process of one person-one vote was 
designed to keep the elected officials in line, not to have 5,920 landlords for 
one measly building. 
</P>
<P>
 The silliness doesn't stop there. As dictated by the ordinance, the voters in 
November must pass judgment on whether two-thirds of the building should be 
leased to the Los Angeles city attorney's office for $6,300 a month. Well, the 
city attorney's office is already there , on an emergency basis, because of the 
Northridge quake, but it is only paying the city of San Fernando $1,300 a 
month. This is going to add $5,000 a month to the city coffers. Not a bad deal 
for a local government and a City Council that can't be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, these little ballot measures on that single piece of real estate 
could cost city taxpayers as much as $13,000 to $15,000. In a city where damage 
from the quake ($9 million) amounts to more than one-fourth of its budget this 
year (about $35 million), the cost of this ordinance is ridiculous. We suggest 
that it is the ordinance, not the lease arrangement, that ought to be put to 
another vote and given the old heave-ho as soon as possible.

BEILENSON, SYBERT AND THE HEALTH CARE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having read the respective articles on proposed health care reform of 24th 
District congressional candidates Rich Sybert and Anthony Beilenson (Sept. 25), 
I was struck by the wide gulf that exists between them. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mr. Beilenson purports to espouse a "go-slow approach," he is one of the 
co-sponsors of HR 1200, the legislation that would impose a "single-payer" 
system like that which exists in Canada. Mr. Beilenson avoids any mention of 
this fact in his article, even though it's the centerpiece of his proposals on 
health care reform. The likelihood is that he fails to mention his 
co-sponsorship of single-payer legislation because he has some concern that 
24th District voters might not share his view that a single-payer (the federal 
government) system is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to figure how Mr. Beilenson ostensibly embraces a "cautious 
approach" while proposing a single-payer system of socialized medicine that 
could not be more radical. In all events, Mr. Beilenson should make it plain to 
24th District voters that he has taken a leadership role in advancing 
single-payer legislation, instead of proposing in his article literally nothing 
other than caution. 
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
 * On the topic of "legal reform," Richard Sybert's commentary, "How Congress 
Should Operate on Health Care," (Sept. 25) is factually inaccurate, as well as 
misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert claims that "conspicuously absent from the Administration's (health 
proposals) is any suggestion of reform of the legal system." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, much to the displeasure of consumer groups, the President's health 
plan would have restricted medical malpractice victims from going to court 
against negligent providers; allowed negligent physicians to hold onto money 
owed victims and pay in installments; limited incentives for plaintiff 
attorneys to take medical malpractice cases by restricting their fees but not 
defense attorney fees; and forced taxpayers to pay for negligent physicians' 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of us concerned about deterring medical malpractice, at a time when 
Harvard medical experts report that medical negligence has become the 
third-leading cause of preventable death in the United States, the failure of 
these anti-consumer "legal reforms" is no disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar restrictions in California have denied injured patients in the San 
Fernando Valley legal representation and fair compensation for their losses, 
while clearly not reducing the state's health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 A Panorama City woman with severe jaw damage and a cancerous infection due to 
an HMO's misdiagnosis and refusal to treat her has been unable to find a lawyer 
to represent her due to state legal restrictions. But the woman has carried on 
the case alone while the federal government, which has recognized the injuries 
caused by the medical negligence as a disability, pays for her medical care and 
basic needs through taxpayer-funded programs because the woman can no longer 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a newborn at a Woodland Hills HMO facility was crippled because, 
despite his mother's warning about her "high-risk" delivery, no doctor was 
present during the birth, only a nurse-midwife who lacked the skill to guide 
the newborn out. The crippled child, due to state caps on a victim's 
compensation and barriers to prosecution, received only $250,000 for life. More 
troubling to the parents, the HMO has continued its practice of not assigning 
doctors to births undeterred -- with dozens of other children seriously injured 
through the same circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the declining quality of care Americans can expect if the "legal 
reform" agenda of Sybert, and of Clinton, is enacted.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Harris' sophomoric attempt at humor in his column "Eisner's Flanking 
Maneuver" (Oct. 4) missed its mark by the widest of margins. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not writing to defend the person, style or business acumen of Disney's 
Michael Eisner. He, I am certain, is well equipped to handle that himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Harris does try. However, he seems regularly to come away minus humor, 
cleverness, sensitivity, subtlety or a modicum of discipline. Instead, his 
cynical take on Eisner arrives with an obviously forced and peevish mixture of 
sarcasm, churlishness, mean-spiritedness and, yeah, pettiness.

TREES, FLOWERS AND FREEWAY SOUND WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transit Authority has voted to plant trees and wildflowers 
along Metrolink's Santa Clarita route. The program, known as the Northwest San 
Fernando Valley Greenway Project, is a welcome attempt to beautify the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time that this and similar projects are under way, Caltrans is 
ripping out foliage along Valley freeways and erecting miles of unsightly -- 
soon to be graffiti-covered -- sound walls. 
</P>
<P>
 These are frequently unnecessary for insulating homeowners against offensive 
traffic noise. Earthen berms or sound walls placed behind the existing greenery 
would work nearly as well and be far more pleasing to motorists than the 
current trend of covering the Valley in cement. 
</P>
<P>
 No place is this more apparent and obnoxious than along the Ventura Freeway, 
an area which is beginning to resemble a concrete box. Let's halt this practice 
and save our trees before it's too late.

TRANSIT CHOICE: MONORAIL OR FREEWAY FOR BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This Valley needs and deserves a rapid transit system. There is an easy way to 
decide what type of system should be built, and what route it should take. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue should be placed before the voters. The members of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority should publicly announce the MTA's willingness to 
accept as binding the results of the vote. I am confident that the voters will 
again choose the monorail. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time for those obstructionists to quit trying to get behind closed doors 
what they were denied and will be denied at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 GARY FORSCH 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Valley 
</P>
<P>
 * Why not turn the Burbank and Chandler boulevard route through the San 
Fernando Valley into a superhighway exclusively for high-speed buses? Pave the 
route and allow only rapid transit buses on it. The buses could run in 
caravans, stopping only where the proposed subway trains for that route would 
stop. They could be luxurious and powered by propane or electricity -- 
non-polluting. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare this rapid transit alternative to a monorail on top of the Ventura 
Freeway. The bus superhighway would be much cheaper to build, would be able to 
move more people, would be way more quiet, and would spare the millions who 
regularly are on the freeway, the hassles that heavy monorail construction on 
top of the freeway would inevitably bring them. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to a superhighway for fast, rubber-tired, non-polluting buses built 
on what is now abandoned land gone to weed, a monorail built on top of the most 
important traffic artery in the San Fernando Valley is a preposterous idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, from what I read, the majority of the members of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority are ready to approve this idea at their upcoming 
October meeting. I would ask them to approve a bus superhighway along 
Burbank/Chandler instead.

WHERE THE U.S. SHOULD STAND IN THE NEW WORLD ORDER; EFFECTIVE FOREIGN POLICY 
REQUIRES A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS AND THE WILL TO ACT ON 
THEM, A STRONG DEFENSE CAPABILITY AND CONSTANCY TO OUR FRIENDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH SYBERT, Republican Rich Sybert was state director of planning and 
research from 1991 to 1993. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Cold War recedes into history, the result of our having stood tall in 
the 1980s, the outlines of future foreign policy are emerging: 
</P>
<P>
 First, the new world order is in some respects more violent and unpredictable 
than the old, because regional conflicts and conventional warfare both have 
become more likely without the restraining hand of superpower rivalry and the 
threat of nuclear annihilation. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, global conflicts increasingly will take a North-South cast rather than 
East-West, on issues ranging from resource consumption to environmental 
protection to immigration and population. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, as we move rapidly into a global economy, international trade 
will increasingly dominate foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Effective U.S. foreign policy in this changing world, in turn, will require 
three things: (1) a clear understanding of our national interests and the will 
to act on them; (2) a strong and effective defense capability to make sure we 
can; (3) constancy to friends and those with whom we share values and ties. 
</P>
<P>
 * Determine our national interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States should act decisively where our interests are at stake. 
Those interests may be economic (access to resources), social (the war on 
drugs, illegal immigration) or cultural. For example, I strongly support the 
U.S.-Israel relationship and expanding our ties with Armenia. These are Western 
outposts with whom we share ties of blood and kinship. 
</P>
<P>
 This requires making judgments. The Persian Gulf, with half the world's oil 
supplies, and the Panama Canal, through which America's Navy and commerce flow, 
are vital to U.S. interests. Haiti, which has no strategic value and which 
produces nothing, is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, we have no compelling national interest in either Somalia or 
Rwanda, and we should not have sent U.S. troops in. Certainly we can contribute 
to United Nations humanitarian missions (although never put U.S. troops under 
U.N. command), but it is not our responsibility to get in the middle of 
1,000-year-old tribal conflicts halfway around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration seems incapable of making such 
judgments. In fact, this Administration seems to have no idea what it is doing. 
Haiti is only the latest example. Our policy there seemed to change daily, and 
when we did go in, the explanations of our national interest seemed wholly 
unconvincing. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Korea, the "deal" we got was a bad one, and dangerous: It leaves 
North Korea's nuclear program frozen at status quo, when the status quo is 
unacceptable: We cannot permit small and irresponsible terrorist nations to 
possess nuclear weapons. Fighting nuclear proliferation and the spread of 
chemical and biological weapons must be a key aim of U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintain a strong defense. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong U.S. foreign policy requires a strong defense capability to back it 
up. I am proud to have served both as an intelligence officer in the United 
States Naval Reserve, and as special assistant to the secretary of defense, 
working closely with Gen. Colin Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, we are busy dismantling this nation's defense infrastructure, 
particularly here in California. It is no accident that Saddam Hussein took his 
chances when U.S. forces were stretched thin in Haiti. While I support 
President Clinton's response, we should not have been put in that position in 
the first place. Base closures and defense cuts have gone too far; they are 
decimating our defense capability and devastating Southern California's 
economy. I will vote to reverse this trend and restore a strong defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * Push for more free and fair trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Our foreign policy must include an aggressive component of allowing Americans 
and U.S. companies to compete strongly around the world. Many Southern 
California businesses will prosper from recent trade treaties, but some -- 
particularly the critical entertainment industry, with more than $4 billion in 
net export earnings -- have not been treated fairly. We should also carefully 
review trade in leading-edge technology and know-how, so that we do not give 
away the store, and we should insist that any international trade tribunals 
reflect U.S. weight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Needed: a changing of the guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, we have seen no such rational approach to our foreign policy 
interests. Congress and the Administration have ignored or punted on the real 
threats to our national security: illegal immigration, drugs and barriers to 
U.S. trade and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 My opponent, Congressman Anthony Beilenson, is a neo-isolationist who has 
called the nuclear threat in North Korea "none of our business," and an 
anti-defense ideologue who, like the President, has never done military service 
himself. He has dismissed the threat of nuclear proliferation in North Korea as 
an "affair between neighbors" at the same time he has called for $40 billion 
more in defense cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not only uninformed, it is dangerously irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 On Israel, Beilenson was among only a handful of representatives who voted 
against the use of force in the Persian Gulf, and he recently tried to divert 
more than $20 million in U.S. aid to Israel for population control programs 
(certainly a serious problem, but not there). He has consistently supported 
Clinton, and most recently used his position on the powerful Rules Committee to 
prevent Haiti even coming up for a vote on the floor. This is not the kind of 
leadership we need or deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who has lived all over the world with substantial experience both 
in foreign trade and defense, I will not have to be educated on the job. I know 
that the United States is not just another country. We are the only country in 
the world founded on ideals -- freedom -- and we have a special responsibility 
to provide leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 I will do my best to make sure we live up to that responsibility.

WHERE THE U.S. SHOULD STAND IN THE NEW WORLD ORDER; FOREIGN POLICY SHOULD BUILD 
ON A RENEWAL OF OUR DOMESTIC STRENGTH, MUST NOT RETREAT INTO ISOLATIONISM, AND 
SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON BUILDING INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY C. BEILENSON, Incumbent Democrat Anthony Beilenson has been a 
congressman since 1977. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the end of the Cold War, our nation has been struggling to come to terms 
with the role the United States should play in world affairs. It has been 
difficult because most of us, quite appropriately, are more worried about the 
state of our own communities than the state of the world. We are, 
understandably, less interested in redefining U. S. national interests than we 
are in protecting the personal security and welfare of ourselves and our 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that U. S.-Russian tensions have abated, however, we have an exceptional 
opportunity to concentrate on issues where U. S. leadership can make a 
difference between whether or not future generations of Americans live in a 
safe and humane world and enjoy a decent quality of life. But if we do not 
carefully articulate our objectives -- involving the American people in this 
discussion -- the United States will lose its ability to play a responsible 
leadership role; and in the absence of alternative global leadership, crises 
around the world will continue to proliferate. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest three basic principles for formulating such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
 First, any U. S. foreign policy must be predicated on a renewal of our 
domestic strength. An America that lacks economic strength and social cohesion 
will lose respect abroad and the ability and willingness of its own people to 
participate responsibly in world affairs. Foremost among the major threats to 
our national well-being are our enormous budget and trade deficits. These 
deficits -- and the massive debt that has accumulated as a result of them -- 
have sapped our economic strength and threatened our economic stability. They 
have hindered domestic investment, kept us from successful competition in world 
markets and shifted an increasing amount of influence over U. S. economic 
policy to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 We have made some real progress. Last year's historic deficit-reduction act 
will reduce deficits from 5% of the gross domestic product in 1992 to only 2.5% 
next year. But more still needs to be done to eliminate government borrowing. 
Furthermore, we need to continue our efforts to open foreign markets to U. S. 
exports. Since 1984, exports have accounted for virtually all our manufacturing 
job growth, which has been particularly beneficial to Southern California. 
Because the United States has far fewer trade barriers than most countries, we 
will continue to benefit by negotiating free-trade agreements such as the North 
American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, we must remain engaged in world affairs and not retreat into 
isolationism or protectionism. Absent our measured leadership, prospects for a 
safe, prosperous and free world will diminish, and America's future will be 
compromised. International developments today can affect the cost of a home 
mortgage, increase immigration pressures, affect the environment, create new 
jobs or cause unemployment. The United States is still the only nation that a 
majority of the peoples of the world look to for political, economic and 
ethical leadership. Without our consistent input, however, U. S. interests are 
likely to be overlooked by the international community. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the United States should stop acting as the world's 
policeman. Few events abroad can affect America's core security. Without being 
indifferent to overseas developments, we need to react to them with far more 
deliberation and restraint. In general, we should not use force except to 
defend ourselves and our allies. In the not-too-distant past, that might have 
sounded almost trite -- certainly obvious. But after the past two decades, it 
is a concept we should return to. This is not being isolationist -- it is 
sensible, practicable, and, in the final analysis, will make us more effective 
when we act. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, U. S. leadership should be focused on building international consensus. 
While few international objectives can be achieved without U. S. participation, 
the United States can no longer achieve many of these objectives alone. We must 
reserve the option of independent action, but there are virtually no plausible 
situations -- military, political or economic -- where it would be more 
advantageous for the U. S. to act unilaterally than in concert with others. If 
an action is worth taking, there should be other countries willing to join the 
endeavor. If we go it alone, the burden falls entirely upon us, and the chances 
of success dwindle considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our top international goals should include helping other nations establish 
democratic governments, stopping the proliferation of weapons, protecting the 
earth from environmental degradation and slowing the world's exponential 
population growth that underlies virtually every environmental, developmental 
and national security problem facing the world today -- not to mention the 
environmental and immigration pressures we feel locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I have expressed my serious misgivings about U. S. military 
intervention in Haiti, and I had strong doubts about the United Nations' 
mission in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the United States has also been a very positive force in the world in 
recent months, brokering a Middle East peace agreement between Israel and the 
PLO and facilitating the historic breakthrough between Israel and Jordan, 
standing up to Iraq and Saddam Hussein, supervising the destruction of nuclear 
weapons and leading support for democracy and market reform in Russia and other 
former Soviet states, negotiating the withdrawal of Russian troops from Eastern 
Europe and the Baltic republics, contributing to the cessation of hostilities 
in Northern Ireland, promoting South Africa's transition from apartheid to 
democracy, coordinating humanitarian relief in Rwanda, and concluding 
negotiations on the Uruguay Round of GATT after they had nearly collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 By exerting leadership and maintaining our global stature, the United States 
can, and should, end the century much as it began it -- as a great power 
regarded widely as an honest broker.

REPUBLICAN FINANCIAL PLANS IGNORE DEFICIT REDUCTION; THE TWO DOCUMENTS SIGNED 
BY EVERY GOP INCUMBENT AND CANDIDATE IN THE VALLEY CALL FOR A BALANCED BUDGET 
AMENDMENT, BUT NEITHER DETAILS HOW BALANCING SHOULD BE DONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN B. UNGAR, Alan B. Ungar is a certified financial planner and Valley 
chairman for the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group whose sole objective is 
a zero deficit by the year 2000. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In election years, legislators and politicians who know better often woo 
voters with promises that both they and their voters know cannot possibly be 
achieved. As is often the case, if it sounds too good to be true, and it looks 
to good to be true, it probably is too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 Two documents signed by all the Republican incumbents and candidates in the 
San Fernando Valley follow this tradition. They are the "Agenda for the 
Republican Majority" released by Senate Republicans on Sept. 21, and the 
"Contract With America" released by House Republicans on Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Deficit reduction is definitely not a priority in either of these plans. While 
both of the proposals call for a balanced budget amendment, neither suggests 
how this balancing will be done. Balancing the budget in five years would 
require a reduction of approximately $750 billion, which if a cataclysmic 
consequence to the economy were to be avoided, would have to include a 
combination of cuts and revenue increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the proposals would help solve the national crises our debt is 
causing. Neither addresses the projection that by 2012 all of the taxes 
collected will have to be used just to pay for entitlements and the interest 
expense. Both actually exacerbate the problem by calling for an increase in the 
amount of money seniors can earn without reduction in Social Security payments. 
But the senators tell us not to worry, we'll pay for this by "entitlement 
reform, exclusive of Social Security. " 
</P>
<P>
 That will get them votes, but what about getting serious? Not a word was said 
about how to really solve our deficit problems. Instead, both plans offer tax 
credits for children under 18 for families with incomes up to $200,000, both 
recommend special individual retirement accounts to encourage savings, and both 
offer a wide variety of other tax cuts and spending recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the House version made specific recommendations on how to offset the 
spending increases they recommend. The problem is, the cuts they recommend will 
not be available to get rid of our deficit, only their increased spending. 
While a balanced budget amendment, term limits and the line-item veto might 
help the process of getting to a zero deficit, the total Republican promise 
still smacks of the same old bait-and-switch rhetoric that we have heard from 
both parties for far too long. 
</P>
<P>
 These documents are about getting votes, not about balancing the budget. It is 
frightening to think that the Administration, which has started working on next 
year's budget, could get caught up in one-upmanship. A bidding war to see who 
can promise the most goodies would legitimize political backsliding on the 
deficit and could make it virtually impossible to enact deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, presidential candidate Paul Tsongas told the American people 
there was no Santa Claus. That is still true today. It's time for politicians 
to stop pretending to be St. Nick and begin telling voters what tough choices 
have to be made. Who is going to tell the politicians there is no Santa Claus?

TEXAS GOVERNOR'S RACE A REAL RIPSNORTER; POLITICS: WITH JUST A FEW WEEKS TO GO, 
THE MOST POPULAR STATEHOUSE OCCUPANT IN RECENT STATE HISTORY IS IN THE RACE OF 
HER LIFE. 'I FEEL RODE HARD AND PUT UP WET,' SHE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIA PRODIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been a long day on the campaign trail for Gov. Ann Richards. El Paso in 
the morning, clear down to Matamoros, Mexico, in the afternoon and all the way 
up to this little East Texas cow town for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 After traveling nearly 1,200 miles, she's hungry and tired and wants nothing 
more than a solid meal and a soft bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel rode hard and put up wet," she said to a group of Democrats standing 
in line for the 10th annual Hopkins County Bean Dinner sponsored by the local 
Democratic women. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than a month before Election Day, the most popular governor in 
recent Texas history is down to the home stretch in the race of her life. She's 
neck and neck with George W. Bush, the 48-year-old son of the former President. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure is on. But despite it all, Richards hasn't lost her down-home 
charm and trademark humor that not only brought her fans across Texas, but 
landed her on the David Letterman Show, put her on the back of a 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle and plucked campaign contributions from Hollywood 
movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking dismally into a Styrofoam bowl of watered-down beans with two slices 
of sausage floating on top, Richards chides Rep. Jim Chapman for the meager 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at this. All I get is two bitty pieces of wienie! Here I am a working 
woman, been at it all day," she deadpans in her true Texas twang. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you what," she tells the crowd, rolling back on her high heels, her 
hands shoved deep in the pockets of her white silk suit, "he must have raised a 
lot of money tonight. He sure didn't spend any on supper." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of old cowboys and farmers and veterans and widows roars, leaning 
back in their folding chairs and slapping their hands on the long, 
paper-covered tables. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is this widely adored powerhouse of a woman -- with little to apologize 
for after four years in office -- in the midst of what she calls a "knock down, 
hide the kids, the fur's going to fly" fight for the governor's mansion? 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the economy has improved dramatically during her term, crime has 
dropped 25% across the board, and she hasn't raised taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several political analysts say it comes down to factors out of her control. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats are fast losing popularity in Texas and across the country -- and 
Richards' friendship with President Clinton has only hurt her. Richards comes 
from a long line of Democrats -- and was married to a civil rights lawyer. Her 
tough stance on crime, the death penalty and NAFTA hardly makes her a classic 
liberal, but in Texas she's still left of center. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, meanwhile, are gaining strength in Texas as throngs of 
conservative out-of-staters move to the suburbs of the Lone Star State. Over 
the last few years, the electorate has dwindled to the point that 53% are 
native Texans. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two decades, Texas has been generally considered one-third 
committed Democrats, one-third Republicans and one-third swing voters. But over 
the last four years, the electorate has been sliding to the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most troubling to Richards is the very name of her opponent. 
Texans voted for President George Bush over Clinton in 1992 and have fond 
feelings for the Bush family. And those feelings are wafting over to the former 
President's eldest son, reared in Midland, Tex., and now managing partner of 
the Texas Rangers baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 At one of Bush's recent speeches to a group of educators in Dallas, one 
teacher seeking an autograph gushed, "Your mamma must be so proud of you." 
</P>
<P>
 George Christian, a political analyst and former press secretary to Lyndon B. 
Johnson, gives Richards credit for keeping the race tight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, she ought to be the underdog if you consider all these 
factors," he said. "If she were anybody but Ann Richards in this environment, I 
think she would have gone under before now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Richards has what few politicians have and all want -- star appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 When she enters a room, the crowd hushes and pushes toward her. She's mobbed 
with autograph seekers, picture-takers and parents shoving babies into her 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent fund-raiser in Dallas, comedian Robin Williams took the stage, 
calling Richards "Mrs. Onfire." 
</P>
<P>
 "She speaks and the whole world goes, 'I like her,' " said Williams, who 
offered his performance free upon the request of his wife, Marcia, who is a fan 
of the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards, on stage in her clingy black knit pants and bolero jacket, smoothed 
her hands over her hips and quipped, "I've got everything pulled in that I can 
pull in. I was afraid he'd think I was Mrs. Doubtfire." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience contorts in bellyaches as their heroine gently pats the back of 
her cotton candy hair -- swirled up so white and so high the light shines 
through it. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards is a Texan through and through. Born 61 years ago in a small town 
outside of Waco, her daddy taught her how to talk straight and shoot better. 
Over the years, she learned to survive alcoholism and divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 She was thrust into the national spotlight in 1988, when as Texas state 
treasurer she had the Democratic National Convention in stitches during her 
keynote address in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "After listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to know 
what a real Texas accent sounds like." 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't relent on her fellow Texan and delivered the line that made her 
famous: 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor George. He can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to barely win the 1990 governor's race against another Texan with 
a propensity for saying the wrong things -- Clayton Williams, a "good ole boy" 
Texas millionaire. He made the mistake of telling a female reporter: "Bad 
weather, it's like rape. If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bush is no Clayton Williams. The only mistake he's made is shooting a 
protected Texas songbird, the killdeer on opening day of dove season -- a 
subject that has triggered many a joke. Bush likes to get his out first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad it wasn't deer season," Bush says from speech to speech. "I might 
have killed a cow." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the campaign, he acknowledged that he was "all hat and no cattle. I'm 
all name and no money, so I have to work." 
</P>
<P>
 In 30-second television commercials, Bush -- who has his father's sideways 
grin -- has hit Richards hard on crime and welfare, saying he will be tougher 
on criminals and tighter with welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's gotten a lot of mileage out of the coattails," said Bill Miller, 
an Austin political consultant who has worked for both parties. "But he's had 
to be a candidate for a long enough time that he shouldn't be underestimated." 
</P>
<P>
 But Richards still calls him "boy" and says he has little interest in the 
governorship other than ego. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes more than just getting up one morning and getting the razor and 
starting to shave and then look in the mirror and say, 'Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, I 
think you're so cute, you ought to be governor.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Molly Ivins, a Texas political columnist and author, says sometimes Richards' 
clever one-liners can hurt more than help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a funny woman, it makes people uneasy," Ivins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know some older women who think Ann isn't sufficiently a lady. Well, she's 
not. She's a good ole boy that's a female."

FAMOUS PALEONTOLOGIST'S SKULL DETOURS 'DINOSAUR HUNT'; SCIENCE: MUSEUM 
OFFICIALS ARE OUTRAGED TO DISCOVER THAT THEIR SKULL SPECIMEN HAS BEEN 
"BORROWED," TAKEN AROUND THE WORLD AND PHOTOGRAPHED FOR A BOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Take some paleontologists who taste dirt to find dinosaur bones and risk their 
lives hanging off cliffs just to study the beasts' tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Add a photojournalist fascinated with "Jurassic Park," a traveling skull and 
50,000 photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is "Hunting Dinosaurs," a journey through time told through the 
adventures of the world's top dinosaur scientists -- but one overshadowed by a 
museum horrified to spot a famous human skull in the book's pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I thought was the most innocent thing has turned into a front-page 
scandal," said author Louie Psihoyos, referring to his "borrowing" the skull of 
famous paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope from a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Mann, a curator at the University of Pennsylvania museum that owns the 
skull, is furious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that absolutely scandalous," Mann fumed. "It shows an appalling lack 
of taste." 
</P>
<P>
 It all started innocently enough. National Geographic photographer Psihoyos 
and a colleague spent 1 1/2 years traveling the world to film dinosaur 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 One of their photos shows relics representing the Great Bone Wars, the 
19th-Century race between Cope and Yale University competitor O. C. Marsh to 
find and identify hundreds of dinosaurs. Cope had donated his skeleton to 
science when he died in 1897, so Psihoyos simply checked the skull out of the 
Penn museum to photograph -- but never returned it. 
</P>
<P>
 Psihoyos introduced "Ed" to dozens of paleontologists who regard Cope as a 
hero, while taking 50,000 photographs ranging from the dinosaur graveyards of 
the American Southwest to the Chinese pharmacies that grind bones into 
"medicinal powders." 
</P>
<P>
 Psihoyos and colleague John Knoebber enlarged their magazine piece into a 
book. They added the scientists' eccentricities -- such as those of Paul 
Sereno, discoverer of the earliest known dinosaur, who chews sand to discern 
the texture of ancient riverbeds that hide bones -- and such adventures as the 
time an entire cliff of dinosaur tracks collapsed just before researchers were 
to climb down them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be a wonderful thing to take people on a journey through 
time using 40 paleontologists as tour guides," said Psihoyos, who was inspired 
by the success of the movie "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Publicity about the book's debut alerted the museum that its skull was 
missing. Mann vented his fury on the front page of the Philadelphia Inquirer 
and banned Psihoyos from the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann insists Psihoyos' prank backfired. Cope's skull was lost 30 years ago and 
some other skull -- with its identification number scratched out and Cope's 
scrawled in -- was just added to Cope's skeleton, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then why is he so upset? 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's Cope's skull or James Smith's skull, it's our skull and it 
belongs here," said Mann, who had to alert Cope's family to the fiasco. "This 
is extremely embarrassing for us."

<P>
 But Psihoyos took some 1904 scientific drawings of the borrowed skull to a San 
Francisco coroner this month -- and the coroner pronounced this skull Cope's. 
Psihoyos says he'll return it to Mann soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The identity is important not only to Psihoyos' book, but because one of those 
zany dinosaur hunters decided to grant Cope's last wish and designate him the 
type specimen -- or scientific standard -- for Homo sapiens. 
</P>
<P>
 That caused further outrage. Cope may have been a brilliant paleontologist, 
but he also was a fervent racist, writing books saying Nordic males like 
himself topped the aesthetic and developmental scale, Mann explained.

RESEARCH BEARS FRUIT WITH HELENA APRICOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't pull out your pie tins and canning jars just yet, but the Agriculture 
Department has developed a new breed of apricot that could make tomorrow's 
tarts tastier. 
</P>
<P>
 Helena is a new apricot with a more colorful skin, plumper flesh and sweeter 
taste. 
</P>
<P>
 "Helena apricots," said Craig Ledbetter of the Agriculture Research Service's 
Horticultural Crops Research Laboratory in Fresno, Calif., "are big and juicy, 
with deeper orange skin than most apricots. The flesh is firm and sweet, not 
mealy, so Helena is ideal for eating fresh or adding to summer salads. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect this apricot will also make a delicious pie, cobbler, tart or jam, 
though we haven't tested it yet for baking or preserving." 
</P>
<P>
 Low in calories and a good source of vitamin A and potassium, about $10 
million worth of apricots were sold last year for the fresh-fruit market, 
according to an article in the October issue of USDA's Agriculture Research 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledbetter has worked with about two dozen farmers in California, the nation's 
biggest producer of apricots. In their San Joaquin Valley orchards since 1987, 
he has tested more than 2,000 pounds of the Helena apricots. Although only 
tested there, the trees may thrive in Washington and Utah and other states 
where the fruits also grow, Ledbetter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new variety can self-pollinate, meaning it can bear fruit without needing 
another variety nearby to provide pollen. 
</P>
<P>
 That's especially important because it ripens between two other popular 
varieties in early June, before Patterson and after Katy. Helena is larger and 
more flavorful than the Patterson type, Ledbetter said. 
</P>
<P>
 All cuttings of the Helena variety, formerly known only as K210-35, originate 
from a single tree. A now-retired USDA stone fruit and grape breeder, John 
Weinberger, chose to test this small tree out of hundreds of others in a 
research orchard in the 1970s. Ledbetter's development continues Weinberger's 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't look for Helena in your neighborhood supermarket just yet. That will 
take another few years, Ledbetter said. 
</P>
<P>
 To obtain clippings from the limited number of Helena budwood available, 
contact Ledbetter at his Fresno laboratory. For details, call 209-453-3064.

PYGMY ELEPHANTS CALLED PRODUCT OF FERTILE MINDS, NOT OF MOTHER NATURE; AFRICA: 
IT'S A MYTH, BIOLOGIST CONCLUDES AFTER EXAMINING DNA SAMPLES FROM DOZENS OF 
PACHYDERMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD J. FREDERICK, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stories of pygmy elephants deep in the forests of Africa have persisted since 
the turn of the century. A team of German zoologists, after examining some 
elephant skulls from central Africa as recently as 1989, concluded that a 
Lilliputian version of the world's largest land animal existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, it's only a myth, Nicholas J. Georgiadis, an evolutionary biologist at 
Washington University in St. Louis, concluded after examining DNA samples from 
more than 67 forest elephants, including three supposed pygmies. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgiadis, a native of Kenya, has obtained skin samples from about 450 forest 
and savanna elephants in various parts of Africa over the last four years. He 
acquired his samples by using a small gun that shoots a painless dart into an 
elephant's skin and then bounces out, bearing a small biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 The genetic evidence shows that the miniatures, averaging less than 6 feet at 
the shoulder, are simply immature forest elephants. "In all cases, they were 
young adolescent forest males with long tusks that made them appear adult, and 
not a separate species or subspecies," Georgiadis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's evidence for only one type of elephant in Africa's rain forests," he 
said. "The forest elephant lineage diverged from savanna elephants about 3 
million years ago, and the two are sufficiently distinct to warrant independent 
conservation status." 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are "surprising and very important," said Richard F. Barnes, a UC 
San Diego biologist who has worked extensively in Africa. "You expected to find 
some difference that would explain why you had these funny little animals 
running around." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the largest adult forest elephants are smaller than their savanna -- 
grasslands -- relatives, majestic giants that have become a symbol of Africa. A 
forest bull has a shoulder height of about 9 feet, compared with 13 feet for a 
savanna bull. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest elephants have smaller, more rounded ears than the savanna animals. 
Their tusks are straight or point downward; savannas' tusks are twice as long 
and curve up. 
</P>
<P>
 Although forest types make up about a third of the 600,000 elephants left on 
the continent, knowledge about them is relatively new. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of myths, such as the pygmy one, surround forest elephants because they 
are hard to observe and nobody has studied them for long periods until 
recently, Georgiadis said. Few have been counted directly; researchers have 
made estimates based on droppings and other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reason was cost and discomfort," Barnes explained. "If you have 
limited funds, then you are under tremendous pressure to produce results in a 
given period, and it's much more difficult to do in the forest." 
</P>
<P>
 All this is changing. One of Georgiadis' colleagues, biologist Andrea Turkalo 
of the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York City, has been studying the 
elusive beasts in the Central African Republic for more than three years. One 
of her favorite viewing spots is a clearing around an elephant water hole deep 
in the Dzanga-Sangha reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "They start accumulating during the day," said Georgiadis, "and by evening 
there may be as many as 100 elephants there of various sizes and shapes. It's 
noisy too, sort of like a big elephant cocktail party." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, even though the reserve is near the transition zone between 
forest and savanna, none of the animals Georgiadis tested there proved to be 
savanna elephants, even though some looked a bit like them. 
</P>
<P>
 The same pattern held true for forest elephants in Gabon, on Africa's west 
coast. Their mitochondrial DNA -- genes inherited from the mother -- was 
distinctly different from that of the savanna elephants. 
</P>
<P>
 The genetic preference for differing habitats has also led to differences in 
behavior. Forest elephants generally congregate in smaller bands, and they eat 
more fruits and broad-leaf foliage than their savanna counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "A single male has to work much harder to find receptive females in the forest 
than he does in the savanna," said Georgiadis, whose work has been supported by 
the National Geographic Society. "Individual forest males probably don't sire 
as many offspring as their counterparts in the more open spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 The genetic and behavioral findings raise caution flags for well-meaning 
conservationists who are often tempted to move elephants to new locations. 
</P>
<P>
 That move was all right, said Georgiadis, "because all the elephants came from 
savanna areas, and they were released in a similar environment. But plans for 
sizable future translocations should avoid mixing the two species and make sure 
they're put in the proper habitats." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only recently become clear that geneticists have an equally important 
role in the management of free-ranging and captive-animal populations," said 
David S. Woodruff, director of the Center for Conservation Science at the 
University of California, San Diego.

HOSPITALS PRIME HATCHERIES FOR DRUG-RESISTANT BACTERIA; INFECTIONS: EFFORT TO 
PREVENT TRANSMISSION HEIGHTENED, BUT 5% TO 10% OF ALL PATIENTS GET INFECTIONS 
WHEN HOSPITALIZED. THAT CONTRIBUTES TO 60,000 DEATHS A YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 The quiet of the intensive care unit is disturbed only by the soft chatter of 
the staff and the hum of machines keeping people alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some patients are on respirators, many barely able to move under the tangle of 
tubes and intravenous lines. 
</P>
<P>
 In this unit, at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, the patients are 
getting the best treatment medicine has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also could be facing risks as never before. Hospitals are the cradle 
of the growing threat of bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and the sickest of 
patients are the most vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Five percent to 10% of all patients get infections when they are hospitalized. 
Each surgical cut is a breach in the body's most important defense, the skin, 
and the sicker the patient, the more vulnerable the person is to infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital-borne disease is a major contributing factor in 60,000 deaths each 
year, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 
many cases, bacteria and infection are the last push to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacteria lurk everywhere -- on clothing, walls, blankets, medical equipment. 
Hospital workers can pass them on by hand. Some bacteria cling to plastic and 
travel up tubes inserted into the body. 
</P>
<P>
 So, doctors say, in the quest to treat cancer and AIDS and debilitating 
diseases, the weakest patients also are facing greater risks with the emergence 
of resistant bacteria in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of infection now is unacceptable," said Dr. Alexander Tomasz of New 
York's Rockefeller University. "We must have enforcement of infection control: 
nurses washing hands between patients, wearing and changing gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are strict rules now, but the suspicion is they are not being 
followed." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomasz and Dr. Richard Roberts, chief of infectious diseases at New York 
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, helped found the Bacterial Antibiotic 
Resistance Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The group wants the city's hospitals to help it track strains of bacteria that 
have developed resistance to at least some antibiotics -- enterococcus, 
staphylcoccus and pneumococcus. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has the support of the city's health department, but its 
surveillance program is voluntary and it's too soon to say if it will be 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomasz acknowledges that some hospitals may be reluctant to participate 
because disclosing problems with resistant bacteria could jeopardize their 
reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomasz and Roberts say what is needed in large part is a rededication to 
practices pioneered by Florence Nightingale: good hygiene and monitoring 
infectious diseases in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must encourage people to wash their hands between patients. It's not done 
as well as it should be," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals also are trying to isolate patients with resistant bacteria by 
putting them in rooms by themselves, placing a tremendous strain on some 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that resistance is so prevalent in some places that they 
don't have enough rooms for these patients," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Jakob, an infection-control specialist, instructs Columbia 
Presbyterian's staff about problems with resistant bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an emerging problem that doctors and nurses didn't learn about in 
school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her department examines bacteria from the lab to identify any patients with 
resistant bacteria. Nurses and doctors wear gowns, gloves and masks when 
treating a patient, then take off the gear before moving on. Medical equipment 
is specially cleaned and, in some cases, the hospital will limit the staff 
members allowed to treat a patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the 1920s, hospitals were known as crowded poorhouses of rampant disease 
and infection. Indeed, the middle class and wealthy were treated at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Resistant bacteria could give hospitals a bad name again, and eventually make 
choosing a hospital a consumer issue -- especially if super-strains of 
enterococcus, which are resistant to the "last resort" antibiotic vancomycin, 
share their DNA with other microbes. Bacteria are capable of this, and many 
doctors think it only a matter of time before staphylcoccus or pneumococcus 
pick up this shield. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the problem of resistance would be exponentially worse because staph and 
pneumococcus are extremely common, in hospitals as well as in the community at 
large. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the future, somebody is going to find out that a hospital has a problem 
and sue," said Dr. Stuart B. Levy of Tufts University and the author of "The 
Antibiotic Paradox: How Miracle Drugs Are Destroying the Miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know hospitals that have problems, but I'm not going to identify them," he 
said. "The sooner somebody can get out of the hospital, the better. There are 
times when home is safer for a patient."

RICH CACHE OF AMBER FULL OF PREHISTORIC CREATURES MINED IN CARIBBEAN; DOMINICAN 
REPUBLIC: THE FOSSILIZED TREE RESIN HAS BEEN USED AS DECORATION SINCE THE STONE 
AGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 High in the hills surrounding this city in the Cibao Valley, hundreds of 
narrow openings tunnel into the world's second-richest cache of amber. 
</P>
<P>
 For scientists, the ancient tree resin found in the tunnels brings a glimpse 
into primeval life in the West Indies through perfectly preserved prehistoric 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 For mine owners like Ramon Martinez, the tunnels mean annual sales of about 
$25,000 in a country where the per-capita income is less than $500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 For amber miners and their families, the tunnels mean three meals a day and 
perpetuation of a family occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gem-like in its rich shades of gold, orange, brown and, rarely, blue, the 
fossilized tree sap has been used as a decoration and good-luck charm since the 
Stone Age. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest and most accessible source is the Baltic coast, where resin is 
easily mined in shoreline deposits and sometimes even washes up on beaches. 
Amber is also mined in southeastern Mexico, Canada, China, the Middle East, 
Alaska, Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is in the dense subtropical hills of this poor Caribbean country that 
some of the most valuable amber samples -- those containing the prehistoric 
insects -- are found. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of years ago, trees from now-vanished forests produced a sticky resin 
that slowly hardened into iridescent clumps. Often the hardening sap became a 
premature tomb for an unlucky grasshopper or tick. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a piece of amber with such contents is worth thousands of dollars. A 
rock with a 30-million-year-old lizard trapped inside is worth about $15,000, 
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, Dominican miners tossed out such pieces, believing them to be 
flawed and worthless. Now, proceeds from such a find can feed a miner's family 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez employs five teams of seven or eight men to extract amber from his 
mines. Dominican miners earn about $10 a day, according to some industry 
sources -- twice the average salary of their counterparts in the sugar cane and 
coffee fields, the country's main sources of income. 
</P>
<P>
 "They live simply, but they're not destitute," said Patrick Fagg, a jeweler 
who sells amber in the northern resort town of Sosua. 
</P>
<P>
 Most miners live near the tunnels in the Cordillera Septentional mountain 
range in huts made of tin or palm leaves. They spend their days about 600 feet 
underground, where they crouch or lie in the light of flickering candles, 
chipping the amber out of hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite long hours and high risks, most amber miners wouldn't consider leaving 
the trade into which they were born, says George O. Poinar Jr., a 
paleobiologist at UC Berkeley and author of several books on amber. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 families work in the amber mines of the north-central Cibao Valley, 
Martinez said. The miners' age range, he says, is 10 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, 42, has worked in the amber business for 30 years. As a teen-ager, 
he and his brothers followed his uncle to Santiago's mines to buy small pieces 
of amber. It was about the time the Dominican government began to see amber's 
potential as a mineral export. 
</P>
<P>
 In his tiny shop in a large, run-down market on the outskirts of town, 
Martinez shaves and polishes the crude amber brought in daily from his mines. 
He sells it to buyers from Japan, Italy and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, he provided American movie producers with a piece of amber 
containing an ancient mosquito. It inspired an incident in the 1993 movie 
"Jurassic Park." In the film, scientists use dinosaur blood inside the mosquito 
to reconstruct and clone dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominican amber sales jumped fivefold in the aftermath of the science-fiction 
hit, Martinez said. The movie also spawned a thriving counterfeit amber 
industry. Street vendors around the world sell unwitting tourists realistic 
plastic pieces that sometimes contain newly dead frogs or lizards. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some spectacular forgeries out there," said David Grimaldi, an 
entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to tell the difference: True amber, when rubbed hard, emits a pleasant 
pine scent. It also becomes electrically charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Although demand for the semiprecious material has fallen in the last year, 
scientists still consider Dominican amber unparalleled for its fossils. 
</P>
<P>
 "The preservation is unreal," said Francis Hueber, a paleobotanist at the 
Smithsonian Institution in Washington. "We're able to dissect the amber and 
expose the actual structures of an (prehistoric) insect's muscles, eyes, jaws 
and nervous system." 
</P>
<P>
 Miners say amber is less plentiful now than it was a decade ago, but few in 
the industry believe that the world's supply will be depleted anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deposits are always being discovered," said Grimaldi. He and a team from the 
American Museum recently found several significant 90-million-year-old deposits 
near Raritan Bay, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Amber is removed with high-tech mining and dredging equipment in most places. 
In the Dominican Republic, the miners' only tools are hammers, chisels and 
calloused hands.

PAPRIKA TO GO ON SALE AGAIN IN HUNGARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuter 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paprika will go on sale again this week under strict new controls designed to 
prevent more people from being poisoned by lead-laced fakes, officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Attila Karoly Soos, state secretary in the industry and trade ministry, told 
reporters that the government had approved a decree allowing paprika sales to 
resume only in shops and only in packages bearing a special stamp of quality 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungary banned sales of paprika powder Sept. 29 after dozens of people fell 
ill after eating contaminated batches of the spice in their food. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigations showed that criminals had laced low-quality, pale powder with a 
red anti-corrosive paint called minium, which contains massive amounts of lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the tainted paprika sickened 108 people, 65 of whom required treatment 
in local hospitals.

EVEN IN THE BIG CITY, A SHAGGY BACK YARD CAN BE A LIFESAVER FOR WILDLIFE; 
ENVIRONMENT: HOME LANDSCAPES, SCHOOL GROUNDS AND POCKET PARKS, ONE BIOLOGIST 
SAYS, CAN PROVIDE CONSIDERABLE LIVING SPACE FOR BIRDS, SMALL MAMMALS, INSECTS

 If the black swallowtail was somehow off track in a cluttered downtown alley, 
it wasn't evident. 
</P>
<P>
 The ghostly butterfly glided purposefully on tattered wings between rows of 
townhouses, the same buildings that had crushed her ancestors' habitat more 
than a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Alighting finally on a potted parsley in someone's back-porch herb garden, she 
deposited the last of her eggs. Then she flew off to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife biologists have many theories about why butterflies, beavers, deer, 
mountain lions and other wild animals have begun moving into human territory 
after centuries of separateness. Many see the phenomenon as the answer to a 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately landscaped human habitat, they say, can help tackle the problem 
of dwindling biological diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true, not many people are going to save a species in their back yard," 
said Craig Tufts, who heads the National Wildlife Federation's back yard 
habitat program. "But we can significantly increase habitat for some of the 
smaller critters." 
</P>
<P>
 The aggregate of thousands of back yards, school lots and pocket parks, he 
says, can provide considerable living space for birds, small mammals, insects 
and some amphibians. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation's program was launched almost 20 years ago as a way to involve 
members who primarily were interested in feeding birds. A garden of berries, 
fruits and places for nests was a way to attract many more species than just 
seed-eaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the notion of the wildlife garden has expanded to include a 
complete habitat -- food, water, cover and a place to raise young -- for a full 
range of interrelated species of animals and plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to look at this incredible increase in extinctions by looking at 
everything we've got out there," said Tufts. "Where there isn't milkweed, there 
aren't monarchs completing their life cycles. It's just that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the complete wildlife gardener landscapes with native plants, shuns 
chemicals, welcomes "weeds" if they are useful to wildlife and tolerates a 
shaggy-looking yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not always pretty, but it's a lot less work," said Nancy Davis, who 
allowed her sprawling lawn in Reston, Va., to go wild 15 years ago. "Once you 
stop mowing, boom, here comes the flora -- and the fauna. It's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Herb gardens double as nurseries for butterfly caterpillars. Hedgerows provide 
homes for rabbits and pheasants. A small plot of corn makes a rest stop for 
migrating geese. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest twist is the water garden, a sort of wetland in a tub. Kits that 
include plastic liners and water pumps are sold at some garden centers and 
hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, people start out with an aquatic version of the lawn -- one or two 
waterlilies, a fountain and some carp that cost $50 apiece," said Tufts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frogs will show up in the darndest places," he said. One such place is 
downtown Raleigh, N.C. The city now has a stable population of tree frogs, 
thanks to volunteers who fashioned small wetland ponds from cattle-feeding 
troughs three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 People who welcome wildlife to their property can be put to the test. Ravenous 
deer have been known to wipe out years of gardening in one night. Coyotes 
attracted by bird feeders have picked off small pets instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of large predators roaming new suburban developments has become a 
contentious issue in the West, where sprawl sometimes meets country inhabited 
by bears and mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Rocky Mountains Front Range offers great habitat for mountain lions -- 
and for condos," said Todd Marlsbury, a spokesman for the Colorado Division of 
Wildlife. "We take the view that if you want wildlife, you have to learn to 
live with wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 The division's educational brochures recommend that people who live in 
predator country make noise when they come home in darkness, accompany small 
children outdoors, bring pets indoors for the night, store garbage securely and 
fight back if attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials often testify at public hearings on proposed housing 
developments and other construction projects that would alter natural habitat. 
"Our position is, factor in the needs of wildlife before you start building," 
said Marlsbury. 
</P>
<P>
 In downtown Washington, the needs were simple: a new flower garden and a pot 
of parsley. The black swallowtail's eggs hatched into caterpillars and 
relentlessly devoured the parsley. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the coming winter, the chrysalides, in bright-green casings, will 
decorate a low-slung branch. Next spring, adult butterflies will emerge, 
velvety black with spangles of yellow, blue and red. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as someone remembers to plant flowers and put out a pot of parsley 
that hasn't been grown with chemicals, they will stay.

FAMILY PRACTICE SPECIALTY STAGING COMEBACK IN U.S. MEDICAL SCHOOLS; MEDICINE: 
TURNAROUND COMES AT A TIME WHEN HEALTH CARE EXPERTS AND THE CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION ARE PRESSING FOR FEWER SPECIALISTS AND MORE PRIMARY CARE 
PHYSICIANS. 
</P>

<P>
 When Derek Williams went to medical school, he wanted to specialize in 
cardiology or general surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, during his first year of residency at the University of 
Kansas Medical Center, Williams is committed to becoming a family doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually I started to realize that all the specialties interested me in 
some way," Williams said. "And I saw that with family medicine, I could do a 
little bit of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Britton-Mehlisch, who originally planned to specialize in 
obstetrics-gynecology, also changed her mind and is now in her second year of 
residency in family practice at the medical center. The chance to establish 
long-term relationships with patients was an important factor in her decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that family practice would let me treat a wide range of ages and a lot 
of medical conditions, including pediatrics," Britton-Mehlisch said. "Rather 
than just treat the acute problems, I would have a chance to follow patients 
all through their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Britton-Mehlisch are examples of what's happening in medical 
schools nationwide, at a time when health care experts and the Clinton 
Administration are pressing for fewer specialists and more primary care 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a wonderful three or four years for family practice medicine," 
said Dr. William Coleman, president of the American Academy of Family 
Physicians, based in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent national convention in Kansas City sponsored by the academy drew 
almost 900 family practice-oriented students and 600 residents -- more than any 
such gathering ever held in the country, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps just as important, the convention attracted 100 more exhibitors and 
recruiters than had ever attended similar conventions, a sign of changing 
attitudes in medical schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family practice doctors generally haven't received professional respect 
because they don't make as much money or do the highly specialized research 
that brings fame and funds to medical schools, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, many medical schools are adding family physicians to their staffs to 
serve as role models and mentors for students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The role models are moving away from being the high-technology physicians, 
such as a heart surgeon, to physicians who can really interact with patients 
and do a lot of different medical procedures," Coleman said. "That is very 
important for students." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Britton-Mehlisch said she often was told during medical school 
that she was "too smart" to go into family practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students I talk to aren't hearing that as much now," she said. "Even the 
specialists realize that the trend toward primary care is here to stay, and 
they are tending to be more supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. William Jacott, a family physician at the University of Minnesota in 
Minneapolis and a member of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical 
Assn., said health care reform, which has encouraged more managed-care 
organizations, has been a factor in changing attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Managed care has to have a case manager who directs the activity of the 
patient," Jacott said. "That's clearly a signal we need more family physicians. 
. . . Society is saying we need to move in this direction. And when society 
speaks, Congress tends to find funding and medical schools tend to develop 
programs to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has begun to favor primary care physicians -- family doctors, 
internists and pediatricians -- when directing funds for education programs and 
student loans. For instance, the federal government offers 3% loans to primary 
care students, while students in some specialties pay 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other programs forgive all or part of a student's loans or tuition if they 
choose family practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The incentives seem to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 15 of the 126 medical schools in the country have no family practice 
program or presence, Jacott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said 8,531 people were in family practice residencies as of July 1, 
with 411 residencies available. Both of those numbers are the highest ever 
recorded in the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of their four-year medical curriculum, students are matched with 
residency positions in their chosen specialties at teaching hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy estimates that 4,000 general physicians are needed to fill 
shortages of doctors in 2,000 communities nationwide. The shortages are the 
worst in rural and inner-city areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy is pushing the government to work even harder to influence the 
medical Establishment to put a higher priority on training family physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggested incentives include requiring that at least half of the training 
slots in residency programs be in primary care areas, changing federal policies 
to get more direct funding of family practice and ensuring that Medicare 
provides more equitable reimbursement in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The AMA supports plans to increase primary care physicians, although with some 
caution, Jacott said. "We'll still need specialists," he said. "We don't want 
to be without neurosurgeons," for example.

JAPANESE WOMEN RUN A GANTLET OF MOLESTERS ON COMMUTER TRAINS; HARASSMENT: FEW 
MEN ARE CAUGHT BECAUSE MANY VICTIMS SIMPLY FLEE. ONE SURVEY FOUND THAT 
THREE-QUARTERS OF WOMEN IN THEIR 20S AND 30S HAD ENCOUNTERED A GROPER. NEW BOOK 
BY A GROPER IS SELLING WELL. 
</P>

<P>
 Riding on a crowded commuter train, packed in tightly with other passengers, 
Yoko Kurihara felt a hand reaching inside her clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 But she did not confront her assailant. She simply fled the train at the next 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so disgusted and shocked," recalled Kurihara, who now heads a women's 
group. "Groping doesn't leave visible scars, but it's no different from rape." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the forms of sex harassment faced by Japanese girls and women, 
unwelcome fondling on a crowded train is probably one of the most pervasive. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime is rare in Japan, but groping -- ranging from rubbing up against 
a victim to thrusting an intrusive hand under her clothing -- is an everyday 
occurrence, especially on crowded commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 A women's group in Osaka, Japan's second-largest city, says three-quarters of 
women in their 20s and 30s who responded to a questionnaire reported 
encountering a groper at least once. The victims said that fellow passengers, 
even if aware of what was going on, almost never intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with a groper on a crowded train, few women cry out or resist -- 
choosing, as Kurihara did, to flee instead. But their anger and disdain is 
summed up by the slang term for gropers -- chikan , or "idiot man." 
</P>
<P>
 Fed-up feminists say train gropers are a telling example of the obstacles 
women face in their efforts to win fair treatment in Japanese society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Groping reflects nothing but sexism," said Noriko Yamaguchi, a women's rights 
activist. "Throughout history, our country has been too tolerant of men's 
sexual misdeeds." 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring that tolerance, one self-confessed chikan has written a book 
about his experiences. Samu Yamamoto's book, "A Groper's Diary," is selling 
well at Tokyo bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 KK Bestsellers, its publisher, says 50,000 copies have been sold since it went 
on sale in April -- about five times the average book's sales figure. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, Yamamoto talks freely about molesting an average of a dozen women 
and girls a day over the past 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A bespectacled 42-year-old illustrator at a sports newspaper, Yamamoto said he 
counted on women being too embarrassed to cry out -- or too fearful of accusing 
the wrong man, an easy mistake in a crowded train car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't try groping in the United States because American women seem too 
tough," he said in an interview. "But Japanese women tolerate us -- or I'd be 
in jail by now." 
</P>
<P>
 A convicted groper can be sentenced to up to seven years, but police say there 
is little they can do if women do not report assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be brave and speak up, or they're encouraged to advance further," said Akito 
Mochihara, a Tokyo Metropolitan Police investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 But many women who have encountered gropers say shame and shyness caused them 
to simply freeze. Others fear retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 One 25-year-old office worker, who did not want her name used, said she 
wheeled around and stared down a man who had been rubbing up against her. 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to meet her gaze, and quickly got off the train. But the woman 
discovered, to her fury, that he had first stuck a wad of chewing gum in her 
long hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women's groups have urged the creation of women-only train cars. But East 
Japan Railway Co., whose trains carry 13 million passengers in metropolitan 
areas every day, has shown little enthusiasm for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Akihiro Takimizu called the idea unworkable, saying it would make 
for even more congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even women's groups acknowledge such a step would not address the underlying 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless men change, this is the only way we can be safe," Kurihara said. "But 
it's not a fundamental solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Yamamoto, for his part, said he has suffered few repercussions in his personal 
or professional life since going public. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he got a few critical calls after a round of TV appearances to 
plug the book but that most calls came from young women wanting advice on how 
to foil a groper like him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Yamamoto displayed only one brief flash of awareness of the 
consequences of behavior like his. He recounted how his wife once came home and 
told him she had been molested on the train. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt offended," he said.

REP. MANN STRESSES HIS 'SEPARATION'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton-phobia continues. Everyone has heard of negative ads, but the hot 
theme for some Democrats has become what the campaign of freshman Rep. David 
Mann (D-Ohio) calls "separation ads." 
</P>
<P>
 His campaign launched a series of ads that may make Bill and Hillary wonder if 
they have any friends in Mann's conservative Cincinnati district. The ads begin 
with rapid-fire references to Mann's votes against "Clinton's tax increase" and 
"Clinton's pork-barrel program" and to his opposition to the "Clinton health 
care plan." It concluded: "We always knew where he stood. Now they do too." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann said he may also have some ads showing his support of the President on 
some issues, such as the crime bill but for the moment, he said, he wants ads 
that "make clear we've been serving the district and going my separate way from 
the leadership."

 A French woman was found alive in a rubber dinghy after 15 days at sea during 
which her husband apparently drowned and her 5-year-old daughter was washed 
overboard just before help arrived, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Longo-Huyghe, 36, was airlifted from the dinghy in storm-tossed seas 
120 miles off the northwestern coast of Spain on Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 She was badly malnourished and barely coherent but later told a French deputy 
consul in the port of La Coruna that her husband Bernard Huyghe had died a week 
earlier.

SCOTT HARRIS: CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE WENT $49 TOO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A funny thing happened on my way to Stanford. I got a scholarship -- a state 
scholarship that was based on financial need and academics. A letter arrived in 
the mail that was clearly marked "Stanford" and clearly stated "$2,500." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, $2,500 is a nice chunk of change. But in the mid-1970s, this 17-year-old 
high school senior thought he'd hit the mother lode. In those bygone days at 
"The Farm," the scholarship was about a third of a student's minimum expenses. 
Suddenly, Stanford was affordable. My spirits soared. I felt giddy, dizzy, 
blissful. With my mind's eye, I saw the brilliant young scholar in his tweed 
coat striding across the misty campus, thinking profound thoughts. I could see 
myself at the Rose Bowl, cheering on the Thunderchickens. 
</P>
<P>
 Several minutes passed before I gave the letter a closer read. There was a 
catch: To qualify for the scholarship, I would have to be accepted for 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
 This was, as things turned out, a hell of a catch. And at Cal State Fullerton, 
my state scholarship was downgraded to $200. This wasn't close to one-third of 
my living expenses, but it was enough to cover my first year's tuition. Rent 
was only $52.50 per month -- or one-quarter of a $210 apartment shared with 
three roommates. And yet money was always tight, since those part-time jobs 
paid just a bit more than minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardon my nostalgia, but two recent news events got me thinking about the 
plight of college students today, or perhaps the plight of their parents. 
Everyone knows that the cost of higher education has gone bonkers. At a 
Nieman-Marcus university like Stanford, tuition is now a gazillion dollars per 
year. And at those humble, Sears-like institutions such as my alma mater and 
Cal State Northridge, students now pay close to $1,800 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Northridge students said enough was enough. They refused to tax 
themselves an extra $49 to support intercollegiate athletics. Unfortunately, 
their opinion may not influence the Cal State trustees who voted to ask the 
Legislature for another 10% increase in student fees next year. This would add 
another $156 to a price tag that now ranges from $1,700 to $2,070. And it would 
mean that the total fees have doubled in only five years. 
</P>
<P>
 All considered, it's still a bargain. But when you add the living costs, it's 
not hard to understand why Northridge students decided to scrimp and save. 
What's surprising is that the Matador athletes and their supporters made this 
ballot as close as it was. The final score was 2,315 against, 2,116 in favor. 
The Matadors have never taken a defeat harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your emotions on something like this are all over the map," said Bob Hiegert, 
the Northridge athletic director. "On the positive side, I'm very proud of what 
our students have done, and our coaches. . . . Everyone worked as hard as they 
could on it. . . . This was a stacked deck and a tough call to start with." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert is a soft-spoken man who sounded a bit like the coach in the losers' 
locker room of the Super Bowl. From his perspective, however, the stakes were 
much higher. As a coach here for 29 years, the last 16 as athletic director, 
Hiegert is one of the people who have built this program. Laboring in the 
shadows of UCLA and USC, Northridge achieved 34 various national titles at the 
NCAA's Division II level before graduating to Division I five years ago. In 
1992, the men's volleyball team was a runner-up to UCLA for the national title, 
and last year the women's softball team likewise made it to the finals. Hiegert 
and his coaches believed the $49 fee could propel the program to greater glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, instead, Hiegert faces the likelihood of having to dismantle part of this 
program. Football is thought to be particularly vulnerable; after all, Cal 
State Fullerton and Cal State Long Beach have already done away with theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of reasons the Matadors may be forced to eliminate teams. 
The recession, declining enrollment and the Jan. 17 earthquake all hurt student 
funding, gate receipts and booster support. And meanwhile, like many other 
universities, Northridge was facing a court order requiring it to better 
balance the number of athletic scholarship offers to men and women. Although 
women compose 53% of the student body, they receive only 37% of the athletic 
scholarship money. 
</P>
<P>
 If Matador football is eliminated, it might be fun to blame the women's 
movement, and many feminists would surely be pleased. Or maybe we could blame 
it on politicians who have taken money from higher education to feed the 
prison-building habit. Here's a telling stat: From 1989 to 1993, the state 
Department of Corrections added 8,600 full-time employees, while California's 
colleges and universities lost 10,300. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's always the economy. California is rumored to be heading out of the 
recession, but the state's college students are lagging behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point isn't that it's about $100 a year," Laura Alahverdi, an 18-year-old 
sophomore, told me last week at the student union. "The point is they keep 
taking money from us. If we give them this, they'll want more. They keep 
wanting more and more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Woodrow, a 31-year-old junior, points out that many "returning students" 
such as herself may be too busy to care about Northridge teams: "They're 
married, have families. . . . They have other things to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches, university officials and boosters say that intercollegiate athletics, 
beyond the benefits to the athletes themselves, are a valuable means to promote 
the university and community. Hiegert also talks about "the total university 
experience," which is what I expected from Stanford, but not Fullerton. Truth 
is, I never attended a Titan football game, and I don't know many people who 
did. Basketball, however, was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's hard to put a dollar sign on school spirit, but at Northridge, 
$49 proved a bit steep. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert, for all his disappointment, understood the students' financial 
concerns. When he enrolled at Northridge back in 1959, back when it was called 
San Fernando Valley State College, he paid tuition and fees of $39 per 
semester. And he didn't like it one bit when they raised it to $51.

CANDIDATES BATTLE OVER SIGNS; COMPTON: CONTROVERSY OVER CAMPAIGN POSTERS MARKS 
RACE BETWEEN THOMAS TOWNSEND AND KELVIN D. FILER FOR COURT COMMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each year at election time, candidates in Compton paper the city with campaign 
signs. Without fail, the brightly colored posters appear on fences, lawns, 
street corners and utility poles. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Municipal Court Commissioner Thomas Townsend planned to do the same 
this year as part of his campaign to become a judge. He spent $2,500 on signs 
and scattered 50 of them across the city. But Townsend's plan encountered 
unexpected trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Compton officials notified Townsend that some of the placards 
violated a municipal law that prohibits political signs at intersections, on 
fences and private property without an owner's permission. Townsend was told he 
would have to remove the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend, who is running against fellow Commissioner Kelvin D. Filer for 
Municipal Court judge, claims officials have singled him out by enforcing a law 
they have ignored since it was written 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they have enforced the ordinance in several previous elections 
and focused on Townsend this time because he is the only candidate using 
campaign signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend took the city to court, and this week the two sides struck a deal: 
Townsend agreed to drop a request for a temporary restraining order against the 
city, and officials agreed to allow Townsend's signs to remain while the city's 
attorneys review the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides reached their agreement after several behind-the-scenes meetings 
with Superior Court Judge Owen Lee Kwong. 
</P>
<P>
 But the brief legal ordeal has soured Townsend on politics and left city 
officials to ponder whether the law is constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never run for office again," said Townsend, 52, a Carson resident who 
is making his first bid for elected office. "Who in their right mind would want 
to go through this?" 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Legrand H. Clegg said his office is reviewing the law because of 
concerns raised during the closed-door meetings that the ordinance's language 
may be too sweeping. He would not elaborate, other than to say he wants to 
ensure the measure does not infringe on First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we reviewed the issues raised by (Townsend's attorney), we agreed there 
may be some legitimate questions regarding the constitutionality of the 
ordinance," Clegg said. "We agreed not to enforce the ordinance until we 
reviewed it in its entirety." 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began late last month after Townsend ran a hard-hitting ad in a 
local newspaper against Filer, who served 12 years on the Compton school board. 
The ad said that under Filer's leadership as president of the board, the school 
district incurred massive debt, had the lowest academic scores in the state and 
suffered a state takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad questioned how much time Filer, a lawyer, devoted to his school board 
position because of a rigorous work schedule. Filer, who decided not to seek 
reelection when his board term expired last year, dismissed the criticisms as 
negative campaign material. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the advertisement was published Sept. 29, Townsend received a 
call from a city code enforcement officer notifying him that all of his signs 
would have to be removed, according to court documents. Townsend moved about 
five signs that he said appeared to violate the city's law, but he refused to 
take any down. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend contends that someone in Filer's camp contacted the city about his 
signs. Filer denies that he directed anyone to call the city. But he said he 
received several calls from community leaders angered by Townsend's ad and the 
harsh tone of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Some callers also were upset that Townsend had placed campaign signs on 
private property without asking permission, a violation of the city's law, 
Filer said. The callers told Filer they contacted the city on their own, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are really upset," said Filer, 38, who plans to put up about 500 signs 
this weekend in legal locations in Compton and other cities in the judicial 
district, which stretches from Carson to Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Townsend's aggressive campaign) is totally inappropriate for a judicial 
race. I refuse to stoop to that level. I'm going to run a positive campaign, 
touting the reasons I believe I should be elected." 
</P>
<P>
 Filer said he used campaign signs in previous school board elections but that 
he always complied with the city's ordinance. Filer said he plans to spend 
$20,000 to $30,000 to pay for ads in local newspapers, mailers and commercials 
on local cable channels.  
</P>
<P>
 Townsend, who plans to spend about $30,000 on his campaign, is relying on his 
magenta-yellow-green signs and newspaper ads to get his name out. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost amid the uproar over the signs has been any discussion of the candidates 
themselves. Both are Municipal Court commissioners who carry out many of the 
same duties as judges, such as conducting civil-law trials and preliminary 
hearings for felony cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend, a lawyer for 25 years, has been a commissioner in Compton since 
April, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He has served in the Los Angeles County public defender's office and in 
private practice, focusing partly on criminal defense work. Townsend also has 
served as president of the South-Central Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend bases part of his platform on his tough stand on violent crime. He 
pledges to set high bails for serious felony cases so that potentially violent 
defendants can be held in custody until trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Filer, a court commissioner in Compton since last December, has worked for the 
state public defender's office and in private practice for the last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasizes his ties to the community and his "judicial temperament." 
</P>
<P>
 Filer grew up in Compton and has served as president of the Compton Chamber of 
Commerce, in addition to his years on the Compton school board. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that four terms as president of the often contentious school board 
helped him develop the even temperament necessary for judges.

CALABASAS AND MALIBU RANK HIGH FOR ENTREPRENEURS; RESEARCH: AT NO. 28, THE TWO 
MAKE THE HIGHEST SHOWING OF WESTSIDE LOCALITIES IN A SURVEY ABOUT ATTRACTING 
AND KEEPING NEW, SMALL BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There may be better places in California than the Westside to start and grow 
new businesses, but six local communities are on a list of the state's top 85, 
according to a recently published study. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu and Calabasas, which were ranked together, made a showing at No. 28, 
topping the list of Westside localities in the study, conducted by Cognetics 
Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., an economic research firm with a database of more 
than 14 million companies nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Century City came next, at 33rd, followed closely by Santa Monica, which 
ranked 34th.  
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood and Burbank, considered as one, came in 43rd and the Los 
Angeles Wilshire area ranked 47th. In 71st place, and at the bottom of the list 
of Westside localities, was Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 To come up with its results, Cognetics counted the number of companies in the 
state that had started in the past four years and that were still in business 
with at least five employees. Cognetics also included firms that had started 
sometime during the last decade, but had grown substantially in the past four 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 Although some Westsiders were surprised that the combination of Malibu and 
Calabasas beat out Santa Monica in its appeal for entrepreneurs, others said 
that the Malibu area has an attraction of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing for businesses wanting to come to Malibu is the name here, 
the mystique," said Mary Lou Blackwood, executive vice president of the Malibu 
Chamber of Commerce, which has not seen a rise in its membership -- hovering at 
about 400 -- during the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception here is that there is money in the community," she said, "and 
that visitors usually spend, too." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one Malibu executive offered a more simple reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's great air, it's beautiful and it's safe," said Tim Novoselski, 
president and chief executive officer of Miramar Communications Inc., an 
80-person publishing company. Miramar moved from Culver City two months ago 
after employees expressed concern about their safety, Novoselski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's all utopia out here -- there are mudslides and fires -- 
but I love it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some real estate brokers who rent space on the Westside expressed 
doubt that Malibu is attracting many new businesses. Most of the strength for 
start-ups and growing firms is in Calabasas, they said, where lower rents and 
the proximity to Woodland Hills has caused new businesses to blossom. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is not much commercial real estate available in Malibu -- just 
297,000 square feet of office space compared to the 10 million square feet in 
Century City, they said. Currently, 90% of Malibu's offices are rented and the 
city has no plans to add more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an anti-growth city -- they have made that really clear," said Tony 
Dorn, a senior consultant for Beitler Commercial Realty Services, a real estate 
brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, which ranked well below Malibu and Calabasas, the Chamber of 
Commerce has started a new recruiting program to bring in new companies, 
according to Kelly Morgan, the chamber's manager of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most of the city's newest commercial tenants are well-established 
companies -- Playboy Enterprises' West Coast headquarters and the retail store 
Barneys New York, for example. The city is being selective, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for businesses that match the Beverly Hills business culture -- 
entertainment companies, marketing offices, professional firms like accountants 
and attorneys," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica, which Cognetics ranked 34th in California and third among cities 
on the Westside as a haven for new, small companies, is the true local enclave 
for start-ups and growing firms, said one commercial real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more of the entrepreneurial environment in Santa Monica, where 
people are working in garages and in warehouses," said Howard Sadowsky, 
executive vice president of Julien J. Studley Inc., a nationwide commercial 
brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet there are more entrepreneurs doing exciting stuff there that people 
don't know about, but garages don't make it on any lists."

FOR SENIORS; LINDA FELDMAN; TO THIS MAESTRO, GREAT MUSIC IS NO 'CRAZY THING' -- 
IT IS LIFE ITSELF

<P>
 To speak with Mehli Mehta is to be caught in a firestorm of passion where the 
eye is music. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the usual adjectives that apply to the maestro: elegant, intense, 
charming, handsome, exuberant. But there's defiance and impatience, too. 
</P>
<P>
 As music director and conductor of the American Youth Symphony, Mehta, 86, 
stands as a barrier against mediocrity while helping shape the professional 
lives of young musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask me what makes me do this crazy thing?" he says with the animation of a 
much younger man. And then he answers with his next breath. "Great music is not 
crazy. It's the way we do it that is crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Mehta, whose renowned son, Zubin, is life conductor of the Israeli 
Philharmonic and a guest conductor all over the world, rehearses his 110 
musicians -- all of them between the ages of 16 and 25 -- for 3 1/2 hours each 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Today at their rehearsal at UCLA, they are tackling Berlioz's "Symphonie 
Fantastique." 
</P>
<P>
 "Forte!" he shouts. "I don't want your pity. I want your effort." He taps the 
baton. "Come on, let's go." He's displeased with the horn section. "This is not 
pianisimo, this is a monster! I make the effort. You make the effort or don't 
play in my orchestra!" 
</P>
<P>
 The drums come too early. It breaks the tension. Everyone laughs. So does the 
maestro. They try it again. He leans back and lowers the baton. "This is about 
the French Revolution. These are mad people, not ladies and gentlemen strolling 
on Madison Avenue. One bad note kills my inspiration!" 
</P>
<P>
 Another try and the music brings chills. "Thank you," he says and wipes his 
brow. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't fear him. They take their licks well and when he says, "This is a 
big orchestra; it takes a big mentality," there's love in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 They chat and joke. But there's total quiet when he speaks. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is there for anything frivolous -- not with Mehta. He is their 
conductor but he is also their teacher. He uses his wisdom to prepare them for 
a life of music.  
</P>
<P>
 Mehli Mehta was born in Bombay, India, to a life of music. He chose to play 
the violin at the age of 6 after hearing the great Jascha Heifetz. It was the 
music of Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler and Mozart, not the music of India, that 
touched his soul. Although he founded the Bombay Symphony Orchestra in 1935 and 
later the Bombay String Quartet, his destiny was in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a mistake," he said. "I should have been born in Europe. In my 25 years 
playing in India, not one Hindu, not one Moslem came to my concerts. Only the 
English and the Americans came." 
</P>
<P>
 By way of London, Philadelphia (where he appeared as conductor with the 
Philadelphia Orchestra) and New York, Mehta moved to Los Angeles in 1964 and 
was appointed director of the orchestra department at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two months of his arrival, he organized the American Youth Symphony 
with university students from throughout the city. He is the only leader the 
group has ever known. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's great. He lives for this," said Jonathan Wilson, 25, who plays in the 
horn section, which, on this day, Mehta criticizes for being sloppy. "He'd keep 
us until we're 40 if he could. He's got a loud bark, but he really cares about 
the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Every prospective member of the orchestra auditions for Mehta. He usually asks 
candidates three questions: their age, whom they study with (he does not accept 
someone who is not studying with a reputable teacher) and whether they are 
willing to commit to 3 1/2 hours of rehearsals every Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they leave, his charges will have performed all the symphonies of 
Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikovsky and Dvorak, plus the last six symphonies of 
Mozart, five of Mahler, two of Bruckner and all the Strauss tone poems. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is nine years to learn symphonic literature?" he asks. "It takes a 
lifetime. They know nothing. Nine years is nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 He calls himself a benign dictator, but adds that every conductor is a 
dictator. He's accused of being tough, which he admits, but he is also accused 
of loving his orchestra, which he also admits.  
</P>
<P>
 Twelve of his "boys" are in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Cynthia Phelps is 
first viola in the New York Philharmonic. John Yah is a leading clarinet player 
in the Chicago Symphony. Altogether, more than 90 former members have gone on 
to join professional orchestras in the United States, Canada, Europe, Israel 
and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Yehudi Menuhin, Midori, Andre Watts and many other artists have performed free 
with the orchestra. Next year, cellist Yo-Yo Ma will perform at the orchestra's 
30th annual gala benefit concert. The gala is the only time admission is 
charged to the group's performances. The orchestra is completely dependent on, 
as Mehta says, his "55 beautiful ladies" of the board of directors who are 
responsible for its financial well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30th concert season will also feature guest conductors as part of the 
search for the eventual successor to Mehta. "I'm not going to retire," he 
insists. "God knows when I do that I might as well roll into my coffin. When I 
can't do my best, then I will step down." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Youth Symphony performs Nov . 6 at 8 p.m. at the Wadsworth 
Theatre. Admission is free. For information, call the American Youth Symphony 
office at (310) 476-2825.

AT HOME: ESTATE AND PARK ARE CENTERPIECE OF COMMUNITY; BRAND PARK: ONE OF 
GLENDALE'S MOST PICTURESQUE AREAS HAS SMALL-TOWN ATMOSPHERE, BUT NOT SMALL-TOWN 
PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY CLAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Clay is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1912, Leslie C. Brand, a Glendale founding father, was famous for the 
lavish celebrity fly-in parties he threw at his mansion. The private planes 
landed on Kenneth Road and taxied up El Miradero toward his estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, El Miradero no longer serves as an airstrip but is a residential street 
lined with well-kept homes. The Brand estate is now a park and the mansion is 
an art and music library. They are the centerpiece of the surrounding 
community, Brand Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindgon and Louise Clough have lived on El Miradero for more than three 
decades. "The neighborhood looks the same as it did 33 years ago," said Kindgon 
Clough. "We bought here because it was strictly zoned for single-family homes 
and we like living close to the park." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Glendale's most picturesque neighborhoods, Brand Park is located in the 
northwestern section of the city. It stretches north from Kenneth Road to the 
Verdugo foothills. The eastern border is Grandview and the western boundary is 
the city of Burbank. An estimated 3,600 residents live there. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood's gently sloping, tree-lined streets are filled with walkers 
and joggers. One of the regular walkers is Mary Staub, 40, the owner of Emily's 
Giftshop in Glendale. She bought her two-bedroom, two bath home for $325,000 in 
April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I train guide dogs and I needed a neighborhood where I could walk and feel 
safe," Staub said. "I love the small-town feel. My neighbors actually bought me 
cookies when we moved in." 
</P>
<P>
 Brand Park does have a small-town feel, with with stop signs everywhere and 
one traffic signal at the intersection of Kenneth and Grandview. "Downtown" is 
one block long, with quaint shops and colorful awnings. There is O'Neil's 
Foothill Farm Market, several gift shops, a coffee shop, pharmacy and Pat's Ol' 
Fashion Meat Market. 
</P>
<P>
 But the community does not have small-town home prices. The median home price 
in Brand Park is $350,000, for up to four bedrooms and three baths, with square 
footage from 1,500 to 2,000, according to Hamid Hamidinia of Prudential 
California Realty. For about $250,000 you can purchase a two-bedroom, one-bath 
home with 1,300 to 1,500 square feet, he said. At the high end of the market, 
homes range in price from $500,000 to $1 million mansions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brand Park is the Bel-Air of Glendale," Hamidinia said. "Many of the homes 
were built in the 1920s to 1940s. They are well preserved, with features like 
arched windows, hand plaster, curved ceilings and thick walls that you won't 
find in newer homes." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood's focal point is the Brand mansion, "El Miradero," which is 
Spanish for "a high place overlooking a far view." 
</P>
<P>
 The mansion was built in 1904 by Brand, a wealthy developer who founded the 
Glendale Light and Power Co. and helped build the electric railroad from 
downtown Los Angeles to Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing the East Indian Pavilion at the 1900 World's Fair, Brand decided 
his home would have Middle Eastern and Victorian influences. The white 
Saracenic arches and minarets is reminiscent of a fairy tale castle nested 
against the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brand family donated the home to the city of Glendale, and the site of 
extravagant parties is now a library. The lush park also has a lovely Japanese 
tea garden and a historic Doctor's House, and is a popular site for weddings as 
well as baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was attracted to Brand Park because it is a pretty, quiet, family-oriented 
community," said Emmy Goldsborough, 31, a horse trainer at the Los Angeles 
Equestrian Center. "I love walking my dogs around the park." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsborough bought her three-bedroom, two-bath house for $300,000 last 
spring, attracted by "spacious, bright, open rooms." 
</P>
<P>
 When Pam and Douglas Demmert were looking for a house 22 years ago, they 
choose a three-bedroom Cape Cod-style home in Brand Park. "It felt like 
Americana," Pam Demmert said. "There is a real sense of community here. I know 
my neighbors and most of them have lived here for years." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Brand Park's big pluses, according to the Demmerts, who raised two 
children there, are the local schools. "My son attended Hoover High and it's 
run like a private school," Pam Demmert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy percent of the students graduating from Hoover go on to two- or 
four-year colleges, according to Glendale Public Schools information office. 
</P>
<P>
 Another draw is the lack of crime, resident said, and the police agree. "Brand 
Park is one of Glendale's safest communities," said Jack Altounian, a crime 
analyst for Glendale Police Department. There are virtually no violent crimes 
and few property crimes. The FBI crime index for 1992 reports crime at less 
than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had an occasional burglary on our block over the years," said Clough. 
There was even an attempt on their own home. "When I realized he was trying to 
break the lock, I went into the kitchen and called the police," Louise Clough 
said. "They were on the way before I got off the phone." The suspect fled but 
the Glendale police caught him. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Brand Park plus is its location. "I can get to the Pacific Design 
Center in 45 minutes without getting on the freeways," said Pam Demmert, who 
has a design business. 
</P>
<P>
 The community is not without its drawbacks, however. There are no grocery 
stores in the immediate area, and "the bus on Kenneth Road runs once an hour," 
Clough said. "For the elderly who do not drive, it can be difficult to get 
around." Summer heat and smog also bother some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as everywhere, change is afoot in Brand Park. "Our block is in 
transition," said Kindgon Clough, 69. "Fifty percent of my neighbors are 
retired or are reaching retirement age. As the older residents move out 
families with young children are moving in." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Pam Demmert: "We are more culturally diverse than we were 22 years ago, 
and I think that makes us a better community," adding, "It's such a great 
neighborhood I almost want to keep it a secret." Brand Park Village Home Sale

SOUTHLAND SALES TAKE SEASONAL DIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Southland home sales entered their normal off-season lull last month, 
year-over-year prices inched up for the first time in almost three years, 
crossing a significant threshold in the real estate market's slow recovery, a 
real estate information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The median price paid for a Southern California home was $170,000 in 
September, up 0.6% from $169,000 for the same month a year ago. It was the 
first time the market had experienced a year-over-year increase since November, 
1991, when the median of $178,000 was up 1.1% from the year before, Dataquick 
Information Systems reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices have been coming back unevenly, kicking in area by area and by home 
category," said Donald L. Cohn, Dataquick CEO. "Prices started recovering in 
San Diego County well before the other counties. We're now seeing move-up and 
newly built homes regaining marketshare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Properties in Los Angeles and in the Inland Empire are still experiencing 
some price declines, especially medium-sized resale houses," he said. 
</P>

APARTMENT LIFE: NEW TENANT CLAIMS TO BE ALLERGIC TO THE CARPET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Postema is the editor of Apartment Age 
magazine, a publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an 
apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I rent out an apartment and I am having a problem with a new tenant 
there. She has a note from her doctor indicating that she may be allergic to 
the carpet in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, she removed the carpet to the laundry room. She says, in a letter 
to me, that the floor has been shined and "the apartment looks better than 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Before she moved in, I had the carpet shampooed. It's not that old or worn and 
it looked lovely after the cleaning. Since the apartment is located on the 
second floor, it requires carpeting to keep the noise down. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the carpet is nylon instead of wool, I believe that she merely may be 
allergic to the cleaning agent. I've shopped prices on having the existing 
carpet cleaned with a different cleaning agent ($100-$300) and on new carpet 
(about $500). 
</P>
<P>
 My question is, "Who pays for what?" Since I provided the carpet, should she 
replace it or have it recleaned? If she bought new carpet, who would own it 
when she left? What do you think would be fair? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Because she says in her letter to you that the apartment "looks better 
than ever" without the carpet, it sounds to me like she prefers the apartment 
without any carpet of any kind. You, on the other hand, seem to be requiring 
the carpet for noise abatement. 
</P>
<P>
 First, I would talk to the renter and find out if she would be happy with any 
carpet in the apartment, explaining the noise problem to her at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 If she is opposed to having carpet, you may be able to work out some kind of 
compromise. For instance, you could agree to no carpet in the room if she and 
her guests would agree not to walk on the floor with hard shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is not acceptable to her, you may give her a 3-Day Notice to Perform 
Covenant -- reinstall or replace the rug. 
</P>
<P>
 If she agreed to replace the carpet, it would be hers when she left. If she 
agreed to have it recleaned, given the loose rental market (lots of vacancies), 
I would, at a minimum, offer to split that cost with her. It is unlikely that 
you could compel her to have the carpet recleaned anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 If she is unwilling to live in the unit with carpet, and you insist that she 
have it, your only remedy is, unfortunately, eviction. What Happens to Lease 
When Owner Sells? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have been leasing a house in Mission Viejo on a yearly basis for the last 
three years. The current lease expires on July 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to financial hardships, the owner must now sell the house. What are my 
rights as a renter if the house should sell before my lease is up? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The big advantage of a lease over a month-to-month rental agreement is that 
it guarantees you the right to remain in the premises until it expires, unless 
you break it, regardless of who the owner is. 
</P>
<P>
 If the house sells before the lease is up, the lease carries over to the new 
owner, with all its provisions intact. Your rights would remain the same with 
the new owner as they were with the former owner. Tenant Feels Too Much Deposit 
Was Withheld 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I lived in a Culver City apartment for two years. I posted a $400 security 
deposit when I moved in, but I only got a $100 refund from it when I moved out 
and I think I've been cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner says he used the money to shampoo the carpet and to plaster and 
paint the walls. I swept and vacuumed the carpet very well and I plastered all 
of the nail holes in the wall so I don't think he should have kept anything. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I'm concerned, I did nothing that would constitute anything more 
than "ordinary wear and tear," which the civil code says I'm entitled to do 
without penalty. What do you think, and how can I get the rest of my money 
back? 
</P>
<P>
 A: First, about the carpet. You say in your letter that you swept and vacuumed 
it, but you don't say whether you shampooed it. Assuming it was new or freshly 
shampooed or new when you moved in, and you didn't shampoo it, the owner has 
the right to do so and charge you for it. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as plastering and painting go, most Small Claims Courts, where you 
would sue to get any deposit refund owed to you, recognize three years as 
"ordinary wear and tear" for painting, which includes plastering. Therefore, 
the owner could logically charge you for one-third of those costs. 
</P>
<P>
 If you believe that the $300 the owner deducted from the deposit is excessive, 
i.e., more than the cost of shampooing the carpet and one-third of the plaster 
and paint costs, you may sue him in Small Claims Court for the balance.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: NO-VENT CONDENSING DRYERS SAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I am considering buying a new no-vent electric condensing clothes 
dryers so it does not have to be on an outside wall. Are condensing dryers 
efficient and which new dryer features are best? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: No-vent condensing clothes dryers have been popular in Europe for many 
years. By not having to vent it outdoors, you can locate the dryer in any 
convenient closet, bedroom, utility room, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Condensing dryers use a tiny blower to circulate room air across a heat 
exchanger inside the dryer. As the room air draws heat from the hot damp dryer 
air, moisture condenses out and drips into a removable container. 
</P>
<P>
 The dry air then circulates across the heating element and through the clothes 
drawing out more moisture. This process continues until the clothes are dry. 
These dryers are the same size and look like an ordinary dryer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the small extra motors in a condensing dryer use slightly more 
electricity than in a vented dryer, no heated or cooled indoor air is exhausted 
outdoors. This can cut your electric bills and eliminate chilly drafts. 
</P>
<P>
 The drying chamber is sealed so no moisture escapes into your home. This is 
better than just pulling the duct loose and venting your existing dryer 
indoors. Excessive humidity can exacerbate allergies and window sweating. 
</P>
<P>
 Condensing dryers, because they are often located in a living area, are 
designed to be very quiet. This requires very high quality motors, bearings, 
vibration isolation materials and balanced construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing, two-direction drum rotation is used on several condensing and 
vented models. This fluffs your clothes, reduces wrinkling, and reduces drying 
times by 35%. By keeping the clothes fluffed and open, different weight 
materials can be effectively dried together in one load. 
</P>
<P>
 The clothes first spin in the forward direction for four minutes with a high 
air flow rate. The drum reverses for 25 seconds with a lower air flow rate. 
This allows the dryer air to draw more moisture out of the clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 A true electronic moisture sensor saves energy and reduces shrinkage and 
ironing time. By touching and "feeling" the dampness of the clothes, the sensor 
turns the dryer off at the precise time. This is more effective than "automatic 
sensors" that just measure the air temperature to estimate dryness. 
</P>
<P>
 Write for Utility Bills Update No. 789 showing a buyer's guide of 13 
manufacturers of high efficiency condensing and vented dryers listing moisture 
sensor types, drum rotation directions, prices, pre-programmed cycles, tips and 
features. Please mail $2 and a self-addressed envelope to James Dulley, Los 
Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Dr., Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. 'Solar Made Simple' 
</P>
<P>
 James Dulley has written a 176-page book, "Solar Made Simple," for the 
do-it-yourself homeowner on a limited budget. The topics cover solar, wind, 
geothermal, and wood energy -- greenhouses/sunspaces, complete air and water 
solar systems, skylights, solar attic fans and windmills. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the book are 41 Utility Bills Updates with lists of 340 
manufacturers of new solar products, 20 do-it-yourself projects and eight floor 
plan layouts of passive solar houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The book may be ordered from James Dulley, Solar, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, 
Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. The price is $11.95, and includes shipping. Allow two 
weeks for delivery.

10 THINGS TO LOOK FOR IN HOME WARRANTY CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to mounting interest in home warranty contracts (now part of over 
65% of existing home sales in California), industry officials have released a 
10-point checklist to aid home buyers and sellers contemplating the purchase of 
a home warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 First, said Marty Wool, president of the Home Warranty Assn. of California 
(HWAC), consumers should understand what warranties cover and what they do not 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, home warranties are one-year contracts that cover a home's 
mechanical systems, including plumbing, heating, electrical, water heater and 
most built-in appliances. Structural items are generally not covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Wool advised home buyers and sellers to consider these 10 key questions when 
purchasing a home warranty: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Which components of the home will be covered by the warranty? 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Is additional coverage available for swimming pool, air conditioner and 
other items? 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- How much is the fee for a service call? 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- What are the total dollar limits on the warranty, and what are the limits 
for individual items? 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Is the company licensed by the California Department of Insurance? 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- What hours is the customer service department available to answer 
questions and process claims? 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- Will licensed insured contractors be used to make repairs? How long is 
the warranty on repairs or replacements? 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- What is the typical turnaround time for a claim to be dispatched and 
completed? 
</P>
<P>
 9 -- Can the warranty be renewed at the end of the first year? 
</P>
<P>
 10 -- Is the company a member of the Home Warranty Assn. of California? HWAC 
member companies abide by a professional code of ethics and monitor themselves, 
ensuring established standards of practice throughout the industry, Wool 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
 HWAC members are responsible for about 98% of the home warranties written in 
California.

 NEW DEFENSE? Those flu shots for the Mighty Ducks players brought a small heap 
of publicity to the Visiting Nurse Assn. of Orange County. The same nurses are 
back with their needles again -- on Thursday they'll immunize the entire Rams 
football team. . . . Fans needn't worry about any players on the Rams, who play 
in New Orleans today (C2), having a bad reaction to the shots.The Rams -- with 
their bye week the next Sunday -- don't play again until Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 LATE-INNING STRETCH: Who says major league baseball players aren't playing 
ball? There's a game Saturday, Nov. 5, on the spacious grounds at Anaheim 
Hills' Canyon Acres Residential Center for troubled youth. And playing with the 
youngsters at a dedication event for a new building there: Jim Abbott, the 
former California Angels pitcher now with the New York Yankees. . . . Abbott 
was highly active in charity events here before being traded two years ago. 
Also playing: former Angel shortstop Rick Burleson. 
</P>
<P>
 WINE INCLUDED: Silent auctions often produce unique offers. At a major cancer 
fund-raiser for the Wellness Community tonight at Antonello Ristorante in Santa 
Ana, bachelor Antonio Cagnolo offers up . . . himself. Top bidder wins a date 
with Cagnolo on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle. . . . There is an added perk: 
He'll take you to dinner at one of the county's best-known Italian restaurants, 
Antonello -- which he happens to own. 
</P>
<P>
 BETTER READING: The country's magazine publishers begin four days of fun and 
idea-trading at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point today. And they have no 
shortage of household names to help them do it. . . . Monday it's entertainment 
mogul Barry Diller. Tuesday's lineup includes O.J. Simpson lawyer Johnnie 
Cochran -- pending court matters -- plus author and former columnist Anna 
Quindlen. . . . And Wednesday's grand finale: Warren Beatty, scheduled to talk 
about Hollywood and the media.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; STUDENTS FEAR THEIR HOPES WILL BE 
DASHED; INITIATIVE COULD THROW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OUT OF COLLEGE AND OFF A 
WELL-WORN AMERICAN PATH TO SUCCESS. 'I CAME HERE . . . TO ESCAPE THE WAR IN EL 
SALVADOR,' ONE SAYS. 'I DIDN'T WANT TO COME.'

<P>
 Cal State Northridge sophomore Vladimir Cerna is the sort of student whom high 
school counselors always remember -- a poor kid but bright, someone who gets 
into trouble early on, straightens out and makes it to college. 
</P>
<P>
 While his mom cleans houses and his stepfather works at the carwash, Cerna -- 
a member of the campus senate -- studies to be a sociologist. Two days a week 
he tutors junior high students in algebra and geometry. Between classes he 
works as a clerk in the school's business department. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, the 21-year-old Cerna embodies the American dream. He is also an 
llegal immigrant, living in the United States without permission. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, those two views have not caused much conflict for Cerna. Nobody at Cal 
State Northridge -- or any of the other 19 California State University schools 
-- is asked to prove legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Cerna and other illegal immigrants enrolled at the Northridge campus 
worry that their haven will be transformed into a government trap by 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, if passed, would restrict illegal immigrants' access to public 
education, health care and other government programs. It would also require 
school officials to report to authorities any students suspected of living in 
the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here five years ago to escape the war in El Salvador," said Emilio 
Flores, 20, a CSUN junior and photography editor of the campus newspaper. "I 
didn't want to come. But here I am." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, CSU schools have been the fast track for undocumented students 
bright and ambitious enough to escape the low-wage drudgery endured by their 
immigrant parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although lawsuits are expected to delay or void portions of the initiative 
restricting education for kindergarten through 12th-grade students, college 
education does not have the same constitutional protections in California. CSU 
officials say they can only wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how many CSU students are illegal immigrants. The estimates range 
from several hundred to several thousand. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of Cerna's friends know his status. Being an illegal immigrant is no badge 
of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 But like the other CSUN students interviewed for this story, Cerna asked that 
his real name be used. The decision to shed anonymity reflects the deep 
sentiment that Proposition 187 has aroused among those who did as they were 
told, rejecting gangs and drugs and welfare in favor of the historical and 
well-worn path to success in America. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend, CSUN senior Liz Montanez, said Cerna keeps a wide circle of friends 
informed about campus politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the one who goes to meetings, so a lot of us get our information from 
him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerna began his scramble in the United States eight years ago, when he was 13. 
It was November and Cerna had graduated from the eighth grade, the last 
mandatory year of school in El Salvador. He was looking forward to entering a 
secondary school, but his parents had other plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "My stepfather said, 'Pack your things, we are leaving Monday,' " said Cerna, 
who with his two brothers and sister endured a six-week journey that included 
10 days strapped to the top of freight trains through Mexico. "The trip was 
like going to hell and back." 
</P>
<P>
 By the 12th grade at Roosevelt High School in Boyle Heights, Cerna was 
excelling in college preparatory classes. He graduated with honors and earned 
awards in English and math. He hopes now to earn a doctorate in sociology. 
</P>
<P>
 "If 187 passes, I'm not sure exactly how it will affect me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CSU officials say that if voters approve the initiative, legal challenges will 
likely delay implementation, possibly for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, I would try to work fulltime and pay as an international student," 
Cerna said. "But I guess in the back of my mind I'm thinking I would go back to 
El Salvador and teach there. That would be difficult. With the new government, 
it is very unstable." 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN senior Laura Godoy -- the oldest of 11 brothers and sisters from Mexico 
-- is also in the United States illegally. She did well enough at Franklin High 
School in Highland Park to get admitted to Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be the first in my family to graduate from college," Godoy said. "My 
dad didn't finish junior high school. My mom didn't finish elementary school." 
</P>
<P>
 Emilio Flores, who was sent to Los Angeles from El Salvador by his father on a 
tourist visa, enrolled at University High School in West Los Angeles after 
arriving in the United States and took an after-school job at Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 After an angry customer spat at him when he forgot to include taco sauce with 
the man's order, Flores said, "I realized I had come here for something else," 
for a life better than one as a fast-food worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents weren't here. I could have done what I wanted . . . hung around 
and become a gangster," he said. "I was hanging around a crowd that partied a 
lot and I could have easily stayed a part of that. Thank God, I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores stayed an extra year in high school, learning English and then 
stumbling onto photography in the fall of 1991 when the adviser for the campus 
newspaper suggested he try journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started taking pictures and through that I was able to earn scholarships," 
he said. "I shot pictures all through the riots." 
</P>

 Flores enrolled at CSUN using counterfeit residency documents, thinking that 
proof of legal status was required. During his first semester, he continued to 
live with an aunt in south Los Angeles, traveling five hours a day on the bus 
to school. "That was my commitment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to the San Fernando Valley his second semester. Besides a full load 
of classes, he worked 20 hours a week entering computer data at a Sun Valley 
sales firm. During his sophomore year, he received scholarships to pay for 
tuition and books. This year, he is struggling financially but knows he is 
better off than most in his home country. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some villages there is nothing to do but stare at the dirt floor," he 
said. "People come here to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores said he has two dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 One is to have enough money to bring his mother to the United States and pay 
for medical treatments that she cannot afford in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 The second is to make a living shooting pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "In El Salvador, the media seldom tells the truth," he said. "So I want people 
to know both sides of the story."

RETHINKING SCHOOLS: SCENES FROM THE FRONT LINE OF EDUCATION REFORM IN L.A.; 
MAKING THE GRADE; JUST 5 YEARS AGO, FOSHAY MIDDLE SCHOOL EXEMPLIFIED THE WORST 
IN EDUCATION; TODAY, IT'S A NATIONAL MODEL OF SUCCESSFUL REFORM

<P>
 Back in 1989 the scene at Foshay Middle School in South-Central Los Angeles 
could hardly have been worse. Students ran wild in the corridors, ignoring the 
bell schedules. Fights erupted during lunch. Graffiti marred the walls. One in 
five students dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, Foshay's test scores ranked the lowest of any Los Angeles 
Unified School District middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 So alarming was the downward spiral at Foshay that the State Department of 
Education issued an ominous threat to the school district: Turn this campus 
around or funding will be withheld and a state trustee appointed to run the 
troubled school. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-forward to 1994. Foshay Principal Howard Lappin stood with a student and 
her mother on the South Lawn of the White House, handpicked by the U.S. 
Department of Education to help celebrate the signing of President Clinton's 
education initiative, Goals 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 In five years, Foshay Middle School had become a national model for school 
reform, an evolving case study on how educators can bring the best of public 
education to the worst of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "People used to tell me that if you sent your kid to Foshay, you sent them to 
fail," Lappin said. "It's been a long process to get where we are now. But now, 
you can't tell me that the kids who come here don't want to learn. . . . We are 
a school where education reform is working." 
</P>
<P>
 Two key ingredients fed the Foshay turnaround, say the school's staff and 
outside education experts. First is Lappin, a charismatic, aggressive principal 
who jump-started the staff the minute he arrived on the scene in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He was quickly able to galvanize and motivate the school's other valuable 
resource -- teachers who were looking for a way "out of the pits," Lappin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Educators talk so much about the importance of the principal," said Guilbert 
Hentschky, dean of the USC School of Education and an expert in education 
reform. "Howard shows us all what an awesome thing a good principal can be." 
</P>
<P>
 The second factor in Foshay's success: A mix of veteran teachers and younger 
ones who asked to come to the campus decided to take on the challenge of the 
state edict with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all felt outraged and had kind of a fight-back mentality," said Debra 
Laidley, a lead teacher in the school's reform movement. "Many teachers were 
insulted. Teachers were very much convinced that our kids could learn, but we 
knew the old ways weren't working and we needed help." 
</P>
<P>
 Foshay is pursuing three major reform efforts, harnessing an almost unheard-of 
amount of staff training, new equipment and outside resources at a time when 
other Los Angeles public schools have been reeling from the effects of deep 
budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 the school won a $1.5-million state grant to help restructure 
teaching. The grant made it possible to pay for the training of teachers in new 
classroom methods and for the hours of extra time they spend at school. This 
year Foshay is buying its own bus so that students can "get out and access the 
community," Lappin said, adding that it would be foolish not to take advantage 
of county museums, the Coliseum and USC less than a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Foshay was also one of the first Los Angeles schools to join the LEARN reform 
plan. Under LEARN, schools become semiautonomous campuses, free to make 
decisions that range from staff hiring to curriculum innovations. Participation 
in LEARN brings with it specialized school management training for some staff 
and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Foshay also was selected by a private education group to become one 
of nine prototype schools for the New American Schools Development Corp., a 
private, nonprofit organization funded by business leaders during the George 
Bush Administration. The organization paid for five extra teachers, pumped in 
about $1 million in computer equipment and is providing nearly one month of 
paid training time for every teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of this program, Foshay will soon become a 
kindergarten-through-12th-grade Learning Center, keeping students at the same 
campus throughout their educational careers and letting the same teachers 
monitor their growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The infusion of support and program changes are bringing results. Slowly but 
steadily, student achievement is on the rise. Test scores are up by 15 points 
in reading and about 10 points in math. 
</P>
<P>
 Test scores "still aren't great and have a long way to go," Lappin says. A 
high transient rate -- 40% of students leave during the year and are replaced 
by a like number of new pupils -- makes assessment difficult. But, the 
principal said, there are other indicators of progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance is up to 96% each day. Dropouts are down to 4%. The few students 
walking the hallways during class carry a permission slip. Suspensions are half 
of what they were five years ago. Lappin says he can't recall the last time 
there was a fight on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 And more than 200 students stay after school every day and arrive on Saturdays 
for tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foshay presents a profound lesson," Hentschky said. "It shows that when a 
principal, teachers and the community work together and use the resources that 
are around them, they can make a hell of a lot of difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside teacher John Rubio's sixth-grade classroom, the Foshay reforms come to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 It's geometry time and classical music wafts from a tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is this?" he asks.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mozart," the kids respond in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mozart could do what he did when he was your age, then I expect great 
things from you," the young teacher responds as his students work in groups 
discussing the difference between trapezoids and rectangles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio is a "team teacher" with Kate McFadden. He teaches math and social 
studies. She handles English and science. Their plan, which awaits approval -- 
not from a school district bureaucrat, but from a committee of parents, 
teachers and staff -- is to keep the same class together for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can have them again next year, I will know exactly what they have had, 
what they need and where I can take them," Rubio said. "In three years I will 
not only know these kids, but I will know their families. It gives me an 
advantage to help them that not many other teachers have." 
</P>
<P>
 He gives out his home phone number in case there are questions with homework. 
Rubio stays after school running a special Spanish reading class so that native 
Spanish-speaking students who want to can develop their language skills. 
</P>
<P>
 And he gets rave reviews from his students. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pushes us enough to make us learn," said Parish Wagner, 11. "We have 
harder classes and more homework, but the teachers make it fun, so it doesn't 
seem that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 To see Foshay today is to observe a campus attempting to embrace some of the 
key tenets of school reform:  
</P>
<P>
 * School-based management: A council of eight teachers, two other staff 
members, eight parents, four students, a union representative and an 
administrator governs the school, making decisions on everything from budgets 
to curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the council's first early, but significant, hurdles was finding a way 
to instill discipline in the school. The team decided to open a "tardy room." 
Any student meandering after the bell is sent to this classroom for the period, 
a boring proposition that soon became a punishment worth avoiding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tardiness was a very serious problem," Lappin said. "It showed we didn't 
have control of the school -- we didn't know who belonged here and who didn't." 
With the success of the TNT program, short for Tolerate No Tardies, the council 
experienced its first positive lesson in school management. 
</P>
<P>
 "What came out of school-based management was a feeling that we really could 
do things better on our own," Lappin said. "We could control our own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 * Teachers as instructional leaders: The faculty see themselves as 
professionals who work in teams to bring the latest innovations to students. 
Multi-age classrooms, thematic teaching and computer learning are a few of the 
strategies at work inside Foshay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not so set in my ways that I'm unwilling to try something that I've never 
done before," said Wayne Stevens, a 30-year veteran teacher at Foshay and the 
teacher union representative on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said he is sold on team teaching, a way of organizing the school so 
that the same teachers share the same students in all classes. It improves 
discipline because teachers can handle problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * High expectations: Teachers refuse to "dummy down" lessons and place 
students in tracks according to their abilities. Every class is taught at the 
level expected for the grade and students receive traditional A through F marks 
on report cards.  
</P>
<P>
 Lappin and his staff reject the notion that a student who is years behind 
grade level should be given remedial classes rather than the same material as 
everyone else. All eighth-graders at Foshay must take algebra, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't know how to multiply, we get them a calculator and they can 
learn to multiply when learning about equations," Lappin said. "If they are 
going to fail eighth grade math, I'd rather have them fail algebra." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This hard line draws grimaces among educators who believe that failing a 
student, especially one from a disadvantaged background, erodes self-esteem. 
The Foshay staff take another view, however.  
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the overt form of classism and racism is when we say to a student, 
'You can't learn at grade level,' " Lappin said. "That, to me, can't make any 
kid feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the stringent requirements, more than 200 students flocked to 
summer and winter intersession classes to make up failed classes or pursue 
studies; another 200 enrolled in tutoring programs for extra help. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parental involvement: Parents have been invited to participate in every 
aspect of their children's education, and slowly they are becoming active 
participants on campus. When parents speak of what they see as the major 
improvements at Foshay, they talk about campus safety and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that I would never let my children come here," said Renee A. Bey, 
who has two daughters at Foshay. "But the school has been cleaned up. They 
don't tolerate any symbols of gangs, like baggy pants and handkerchiefs. And 
the teachers really care. They will call us at home and let us know what's 
going on and what's expected of our children." 
</P>
<P>
 To bring parents on campus, the school offers them courses in computer 
technology and English as a second language. A bungalow has been set aside as a 
parent center and baby-sitting is offered when parents are attending class. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I have ever been involved at a school," Bey said. "At 
other schools I have felt like I was invading someone else's territory or 
privacy. But here we are welcomed."

TEEN HELD IN IRVINE MURDER WAS PRIME SUSPECT ALL ALONG; CRIME: POLICE SAY THEY 
DIDN'T WANT TO TIP HAND UNTIL THEY BUILT STRONG CASE IN JANUARY SLAYING THAT 
HAD MYSTIFIED RESIDENTS OF USUALLY SAFE CITY. 
</P>

<P>
 The murder of Turtle Rock resident Patricia Lea Pratt -- killed inside her 
home more than nine months ago -- had remained a baffling mystery to residents 
of this city, where homicides are unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 What people didn't know was that police had fingered University High School 
student Earl Rhoney as the prime suspect just two weeks after the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept it real close to the vest," Irvine Police Chief Charles S. Brobeck 
said Saturday. "We didn't want to tip our hand and say that we were focusing on 
one individual at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks after the killing, police booked Rhoney into Orange County Juvenile Hall 
on other charges as they continued to gather forensic evidence and build their 
case against the 18-year-old, Brobeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Irvine police arrested Rhoney at The City shopping center in Orange 
on suspicion of murdering Pratt -- shortly after he was released from Juvenile 
Hall, where he served time for a parole violation and on burglary and weapons 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest break in the case came in early February when another University 
High School student brought a gun onto campus, which police say was traced back 
to Rhoney. Police discovered that Rhoney and three other students had 
burglarized another Turtle Rock home two weeks before Pratt's slaying, Lt. Sam 
Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rhoney was probably the most sophisticated of them all and had some 
experience with (burglary)," Allevato said. "They were all arrested and placed 
into Juvenile Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Police allege that Rhoney was in the process of burglarizing Pratt's home on 
Jan. 20 when the 46-year-old woman returned home from a walk and surprised him. 
Her husband, Paul Pratt, found her bludgeoned to death when he returned home 
from a business meeting just before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Brobeck said homicide detective Larry Montgomery has worked virtually full 
time on the case since Pratt's death. Pratt, a customer service manager for 
PacTel Cellular in Irvine, was the fourth person to be murdered in the city 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long, arduous investigation where we had to pull together some 
key forensic evidence and conduct a lot of interviews," Brobeck said. "We feel 
really good about the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Police portray Rhoney as a troubled teen-ager with a criminal history and a 
drug problem. He had been sent to live with his grandparents in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Brobeck said police will turn their case over to the Orange County district 
attorney's office on Monday. He said it will be determined later whether Rhoney 
will be tried as a juvenile or an adult. He was 17 years old at the time of the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhoney is being held at Orange County Jail on suspicion of murder. His bail 
has been set at $250,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a sense of relief in this department and hopefully a sense of relief 
in the community," Brobeck said. "We just couldn't share any of our information 
until now." 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt's aunt, Jo Ribnick of Orange, said Saturday that family members, 
including the victim's husband, Paul Pratt, had been aware "for quite some 
time" that police had a prime suspect in custody for burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very glad and relieved they have arrested someone," said Ribnick, the 
sister of Pratt's mother, Beatrice Kell. "But, I think a trial will be very 
traumatic for my sister and for Paul. (The Pratts) had only been married for a 
short time. They had all kinds of plans."

CHURCH FACES DILEMMA OVER SEX ALLEGATIONS; RIGHTS: SHOULD FUTURE EMPLOYERS KNOW 
ABOUT CASES THAT HAVE BEEN SETTLED? ARE PRIESTS NOT CHARGED WITH CRIMES 
ENTITLED TO PRIVACY? 
</P>

 When James Rogan was a boy, Father Eleuterio Ramos was the parish priest he 
and his parents knelt before, took communion from, confessed to and prayed with 
at St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in Placentia. Rogan became an altar boy 
at age 10 and worked in the church rectory. 
</P>
<P>
 But every time Rogan, now 29, thinks of the parish priest of his childhood, 
his stomach knots and an anger boils inside. Father Ramos is also the priest 
Rogan says plied him with alcohol and adult movies and magazines, then molested 
him while he was drunk or asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange quietly settled the lawsuit 
Rogan brought against it for the alleged abuse, demanding the amount of the 
settlement be kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1993, the diocese settled -- and similarly sealed -- another almost 
identical suit brought against Ramos, a priest in the diocese for 19 years. In 
a letter contained in the court file, Ramos admitted that he molested the 
Tustin man who brought the suit and other boys of unspecified ages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his sexual improprieties were known to church authorities, Ramos 
continued to work as a parish priest. He moved south to Mexico, where until six 
months ago he was the vicar at Divine Providence Church in Tijuana, with a 
special ministry to families and youths. The Diocese of Tijuana said Friday 
that it does not know of his current whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of any priest that has been accused of this -- why have they not taken his 
vows away?" Rogan asks angrily today. "What was the purpose of the settlement? 
Was it hush money?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Ramos case, and the flurry of recent settlements and suits involving 
priests who once worked in the Diocese of Orange, has raised questions about 
how the church handles the allegations. And, perhaps just as important, how it 
protects others if an accused priest leaves the diocese for another posting as 
a priest, or for a job outside the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been struggling with it -- what do we do?" said Father John Hardin, 
assistant to the head of the West Coast province of the Franciscan Friars, 
which is separate from the Diocese of Orange. "You cannot not deal with it 
today. It's financial and political suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two months, the Diocese of Orange has settled lawsuits accusing 
three priests who formerly worked in the diocese of sexually molesting minors. 
Additional suits against two of those priests are pending, as is another claim 
against Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
 And last month, a former Mater Dei High School student sued Msgr. Michael 
Harris, the former principal who helped found Santa Margarita High School, 
accusing the priest of molesting him in his office at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Diocese of Orange -- which has 118 diocesan priests and 68 
from religious orders -- would not comment on their procedures for alerting 
future employers once they have substantiated claims of sexual abuse against a 
priest. There are about 500,000 Catholics and 53 parishes in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But in dioceses and religious orders across the country the issue has become a 
moral and legal hot potato, especially as more and more alleged victims of 
priestly misconduct take their complaints to court. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, bishops either discounted allegations of sexual abuse or quietly 
reassigned the priests to other parishes and dioceses, or moved them to other 
countries, frequently without alerting anyone to the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Ramos, San Pedro attorney Werner R. Meissner believes that the 
diocese shuttled the priest from parish to parish once allegations were made. 
In 1979, Ramos entered a chemical dependency program after a veteran teacher 
reported to diocesan officials the complaints of a mother who said the priest 
had shown her son dirty movies and behaved inappropriately. Despite the 
allegations, Ramos went on to serve as a pastor at three parishes in the 
diocese. 
</P>
<P>
 According to diocesan records obtained by Meissner, Ramos was at eight 
parishes from 1966 until he went on inactive leave and moved to Tijuana in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want it so that it's published to everyone, everywhere that this priest 
has been accused," said Meissner, who represented both men who settled suits 
with the diocese over Ramos. "He's been suspended. There's been admissions and 
findings and they're true. This guy has molested children. . . . What if he 
goes off to somewhere small, some parish where they don't know and no one tells 
them?" 
</P>
<P>
 In April 1993, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeal in Santa Ana ruled that a 
diocese may be liable if it doesn't tell others. The court ruled that the 
mother of an abused boy could sue the Diocese of Orange for failing to warn 
parishioners about a priest it knew had previously been charged with abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court reversed an Orange County Superior Court judge who found 
that "the diocese had no special relationship with, or duty toward, its 
parishioners," and was thus immune to damages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Damning in the appeals court case was a February, 1985, letter written by then 
Msgr. Michael P. Driscoll to a monsignor in Plymouth, England, regarding the 
prior allegations. In the letter, Driscoll, who is now an auxiliary bishop, 
attempted to obtain employment in England for a priest ho had undergone 
psychiatric treatment for performing a sex act on an 8-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Driscoll said the boy's mother "had made it impossible" for the priest to 
continue as a parish priest by demanding he no longer be able to work with 
children. "No arguments have succeeded in swaying her," Driscoll wrote. "She 
has threatened to go to the police . . . (The priest) is in jeopardy of arrest 
and possible imprisonment if he remains here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Diocese of Orange eventually settled -- and, once again, sealed -- cases 
with both the mother and her son. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the appellate court decision was not published as a precedent-setting 
case, which limits its value, attorneys who deal with such matters say it 
bolsters future suits where it can be proved that the church had previous 
knowledge of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision reflects that there are situations where one can have a valid 
fraud case against the church if they have the information and yet hide their 
heads," said Thomas Hahn, the Newport Beach attorney who represented both the 
mother and her son. 
</P>
<P>
 For officials at the Archdiocese of Chicago, the quandary of what to reveal 
about their clergy came down to a moral decision. These days, if employers call 
them about priests who have had substantiated allegations of sexual abuse 
involving minors, they've decided to tell all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we might be liable if we tell them. We think we might be liable if 
we don't," said Carol Fowler, director of personnel services for the 
archdiocese. "We think we could get sued either way. Since you have to make a 
choice, we chose to take the risk for the protection of the children." 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese, which has 1,050 diocesan priests and 1,000 from religious 
orders, also tells other dioceses if any allegations have been made against a 
priest, even if they have not been proved. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler said the archdiocese doesn't laud itself over its choice to tell. The 
current policies were decided upon after a spate of allegations became public 
around 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great in hindsight, you know?" Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the Franciscan Friars, the issue of what to do and what to say about 
priests who have been accused -- in some cases confessed -- of sexual abuse 
with minors, sits like an unwanted guest on their doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1993, after a yearlong inquiry, the Franciscan order announced 
that 34 boys had been molested by 11 monks over a 23-year period at St. 
Anthony's Seminary in Santa Barbara. At the conclusion of the investigation, 
the Franciscans were praised for digging out every case of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that it's over, the order faces the task of how to handle the priests, 
especially if they have not been criminally charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "What responsibility do we have? Say this friar goes out and looks for work at 
a McDonald's and they call us," said Father Hardin, who is in charge of 
pastoral counseling for the victims in the St. Anthony's case. "This person has 
not been accused and (dragged) into court." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hardin said the bottom line remains keeping others safe, despite the 
potential legal ramifications of telling others of allegations against a 
priest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The friars also have civil rights, and that's where it gets tricky," he said. 
"We have a moral obligation to keep this from happening again. . . . We don't 
want to be driven by attorneys and not by our values." 
</P>
<P>
 One former Franciscan, Gary Pacheco, was recently sued in separate suits by 
two men who alleged he molested them when they were boys. The Franciscans 
settled the suit with one of the men last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardin said if someone called him up about Pacheco tomorrow he'd be straight. 
"I'd tell them I wouldn't personally hire him." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Mary Staggs, founder of the Southern California chapter of the 
Survivors' Network for those Abused by Priests, this is all too little, too 
late -- and she questions whether the dioceses will rat on their fallen 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost as if we're forced to file lawsuits to stop the abuse, to expose 
it," said Staggs, who settled a suit with the Diocese of Orange against an 
Anaheim priest in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs said victims of abuse have started their own database to keep track of 
problem priests. The Survivors Connection, operated by a Rhode Island couple, 
keeps track of allegations and puts alleged victims of the same priest in touch 
with one another, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to be aware there's a priest out there that has sexually abused 
children," she said.

RETHINKING SCHOOLS: SCENES FROM THE FRONT LINE OF EDUCATION REFORM IN L.A.; 
FINDING THE BEST SCHOOL MEANS SEEKING A CULTURE OF SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So you've begun your search for a good public school, but you are daunted by 
the task and discouraged by the large classes and low test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not to worry. Finding a school that will nurture a budding intellect, 
salve self-esteem and set your child on the road to the Ivy League has little 
to do with such mundane concerns, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of poring over a school's test scores, look at how the desks in the 
classrooms are arranged, find out the teachers' hobbies, be a "student" on the 
campus for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 And look for a school that tends to the needs of its students with an eye to 
the future rather than the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average parent who goes shopping has a foot in the pathway of what they 
themselves experienced as a child, but what they experienced may be out of sync 
with what we know today about how children learn," said USC education professor 
Sandy Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents tend to worry about whether there are enough spelling books, if the 
school has an art teacher and how much homework is assigned, but they often 
fail to tap into a school's "culture," and there lie the clues that can help 
predict a school's performance.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have parents who shop for hard work or for nice teachers or small classes. 
. . . But that has nothing to do with the quality of the intellectual challenge 
their kids are going to get," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
 What parents should look for are schools where standards are high and clearly 
explained, where the principal and teachers work as a team and share 
responsibility for how and what children learn, where parental involvement is 
encouraged and channeled to support the school's academic program, and where 
children are engaged in the kind of active learning that will prepare them to 
compete in contemporary society. 
</P>
<P>
 "High performing schools have a culture that promotes success," contends Frank 
Newman, head of the Education Commission for the States, which coordinates 
school reform programs nationwide. "You'll find them in every part of town and 
in every kind of school system." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles -- with its new open enrollment policy, a growing network of 
specialized magnet centers and the emergence of independent charter schools -- 
parents today have choices previously open only to the private school set. 
</P>
<P>
 For many parents, it is no longer enough to trek over to the neighborhood 
school, sign Junior up and hope for the best.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there is a rush of campus tours, classroom visits, interviews with 
principals and teachers, test score reviews. There are conversations about 
portfolio assessments and classroom specialists, about acceleration versus 
enrichment and whole language versus phonics. There are neighborhood parent 
networks to navigate, with their own critics and cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a very confusing process, but it really pays to do your homework," 
said JoAnn Noonan, who spent two years checking out public schools near her 
Westside neighborhood before enrolling her son, Elliot, in kindergarten this 
fall at Overland Avenue Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the libraries, the computer classes, the gym classes . . . the 
custodial things, like is the school clean and maintained. I asked how the 
schools use their money, how often they had parent-teacher conferences, what 
the teachers' aides did . . . " she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I found talking to the principal is really important, because a lot of things 
come from the top. Are they prepared to explain things to you: Can they tell 
you the school's philosophy and how they group the children in class and what 
the teachers' styles are? You have to be kind of assertive and dig to find the 
answers you need." 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Kaplan says there's a lot of room for differences among good schools, 
"but there are some common elements that are non-negotiable. Anyone who goes 
shopping these days has to know there are some universals that we know about 
how kids learn, and they ought to be reflected in a school's program." 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Kaplan said, "one thing you're looking for is a school where 
people can answer the question why and not just how and what they're doing. 
They need to have a philosophical rationalization for the basic foundation 
elements in their school."  
</P>
<P>
 For example, in most classes today, children's desks are placed in small 
groups, rather than rows facing forward as they were when most parents were in 
school. The principal and teachers should be able to explain how that seating 
arrangement helps foster cooperative learning and creates the small group 
environment that research shows helps children learn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most progressive schools these days use techniques such as team teaching and 
mixed-age grouping of students to better match lessons to teachers' strengths 
and students' skill levels. Teachers should be able to explain those concepts, 
and why they work, to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan found that the traditional "kindergarten roundup," where herds of 
inspecting parents troop through kindergarten classes, did not provide her with 
enough information to assess a school. "You need to really spend time at a 
school, to pull up a chair in each classroom when there are no other visitors 
there," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 USC's Kaplan would say that is a critical investment of time. "On the guided 
tour, parents tend to get intimidated by the people who are taking them around 
the school, and they allow that to influence their decision. So, parents ought 
to prepare beforehand and have a list of questions to ask -- write them on your 
hand if you have to, but don't get carried away and lose your focus." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kaplan and others, those questions ought to include:  
</P>
<P>
 * What decision-making model does the school use? School governance is 
undergoing a revolution, with teachers and parents having more say in 
everything from how money is spent to how reading is taught. Parents need to 
find out how decisions are made at their schools, how flexible the process is 
and in what areas the school has autonomy from the school system. 
</P>
<P>
 * How does the school implement and augment the state-sanctioned curriculum? 
The state sets standards on what topics should be covered in each grade -- for 
example, third-graders learn cursive writing and fourth-graders study the 
westward migration -- but schools have great latitude in how they teach those 
subjects. Parents should look for schools that encourage teachers to draw on 
their own interests and expertise to supplement the program, that provide real 
world learning experiences that engage children's interests, and that encourage 
children to think and reason on their own.  
</P>
<P>
 * How do schools accommodate the individual differences among students? Public 
schools draw children with a wide variety of skills, and lessons must be 
adapted so that all children can benefit. Does each class have different levels 
of books and other learning materials, so that all children can have 
appropriate references? Does the teacher challenge students who are working 
ahead of their peers with enrichment activities, and encourage those whose 
achievement lags?  
</P>
<P>
 * How is student performance evaluated? What is the grading system and how is 
testing used? What other kinds of assessments do teachers use? How often are 
parent-teacher conferences? What help is given to students who are falling 
behind? What are the school's promotion and retention practices?  
</P>
<P>
 * How does the school incorporate parental involvement? It is not enough to 
say parents are welcome in the classrooms. Are parents encouraged to contribute 
their talents to enrich the school's program? Are they considered partners in 
the decision-making process? What is their role in raising money to supplement 
school spending?  
</P>
<P>
 "The choice of a school is not something you should make a quick decision 
about," Kaplan stresses. "You don't buy a school for a semester or a year. You 
buy a school for an experience over time, so you need to evaluate that school 
for what it's going to provide for your child year after year."

YEAGER DOES RIGHT STUFF AT AIR SHOW; AVIATION: LEGENDARY PILOT WOWS AND AMUSES 
AN ADORING CROWD AT EDWARDS' ANNUAL OPEN HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dapper in a blue Air Force cap and green flight jacket, the first man to break 
the sound barrier 47 years ago stood shyly in front of a gaggle of onlookers on 
a crowded runway here Saturday, talking about what it's like to pilot an 
aircraft so fast you make the sky go boom. 
</P>
<P>
 His listeners at the base's annual open house and air show stood with mouths 
agape. This was, after all, Chuck Yeager, a guy with all the right stuff, the 
biggest top gun of them all, whose post-World War II exploits in the 
topsy-turvy world of supersonic air travel helped pave the way for space 
exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, "forty-seven years, one week and one day after I made the first 
sonic boom here," Yeager returned to the Mojave Desert to repeat the feat in a 
T-38 fighter jet, kicking off the air show before a visiting entourage of 
Russian aviators and tens of thousands of appreciative, neck-craning fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, what did you have for breakfast this morning?" asked one man with a video 
camera. Referring to the typical bouts of air sickness and migraines among 
fighter jocks at such G-force speeds, the 71-year-old retired Air Force 
Brigadier General responded with a smile: "I had a fighter pilot's breakfast -- 
two aspirin, a cup of coffee and a puke." 
</P>
<P>
 The group howled. But the guy with the camera didn't have it running and asked 
Yeager to repeat the quip. The gray-haired veteran of the skies gave him a 
nothing-doing shake of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like in one of my planes, I've learned never to make more than one 
pass," he said. "You get shot at that way." 
</P>
<P>
 For many, seeing Chuck Yeager -- who made his historic supersonic flight Oct. 
14, 1947 -- was the highlight of this year's show, in which the Air Force gives 
taxpayers, aviation workers, curious motor heads and technological eggheads a 
bird's-eye look at some of the military's most sophisticated wartime hardware 
-- F-14 Tomcats, SR-71 Blackbirds, cargo and surveillance aircraft, even the 
mysterious B-2 stealth bomber. The day was punctuated by the thundering booms 
of numerous fly-by displays. 
</P>
<P>
 With his son perched on his shoulders, Gary Sundberg of Bakersfield showed off 
his autographed hat. "Chuck Yeager is an inspiration, a national hero," he 
whispered. "If you read his books, you'd be amazed, too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, this was the domain of people fascinated with the sky and the man-made 
objects that swoosh through it. They began arriving on base shortly after dawn. 
By midmorning, on a concrete area outside several huge hangars, hundreds of 
lawn chairs faced out toward an expansive lake bed so flat it looked as if a 
divine hand had smoothed it with an industrial leveler. 
</P>
<P>
 Gawking families walked hand in hand, oohing and aahing, pointing to the huge 
aircraft the Air Force referred to as "static displays." Just as they might at 
some state fair or collector's show, they bought T-shirts and caps, trading 
cards, bumper stickers, posters and commemorative pins -- all bearing the 
likeness of some plane, helicopter or fighter jet. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you weren't able to fly a jet like Chuck Yeager to experience a bit of 
air sickness, well, there was a way to do it right there on the ground: A group 
of teen-agers lined up for a ride called Space Ball, in which harnessed riders 
were turned upside down and every which way. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back and forth the families walked, men in baseball caps and severe 
crew cuts drinking 16-ounce beers at $2 a pop. Children sat on their fathers' 
shoulders, covering their ears each time a huge piece of hardware lumbered past 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's our seats, Daddy?" asked one small boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need seats, son," his father responded. "All you have to do is look 
up into the air and you'll see all there is to see." 
</P>
<P>
 And look they did. One joke was pointing into the sky in mock search of Chuck 
Yeager. 
</P>
<P>
 "There he is! There's Chuck!" said one teen-ager, neck craned to the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, he isn't," his friend replied. "He's over there!" 
</P>
<P>
 Holding her 10-year-old son, Justin, by the hand, Sue Cowles of Simi Valley 
said her family rarely misses the annual event. "Edwards is the best!" she 
said. "You get to meet the pilots. My husband works for a defense contractor, 
so this is our life. It's exciting stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he looked forward to seeing the most, Justin Cowles looked at the 
sky and gave an answer that was all-boy: "I don't know, the bombs maybe," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the general whom most air show fans had come to see. Yeager, a 
World War II pilot, remains a consultant test pilot for the Air Force's Flight 
Test Center at Edwards, where he flies the F-15, F-16 and stealth aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, giddy autograph hunters danced away with the name Yeager scrawled 
on hats, programs, even their right arms. As the pilot walked down a line of 
fans, a blind man reached out to touch his arm like some messiah of the skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Teeters of Newhall came away with one of the grand prizes of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got Chuck Yeager's autograph," she said. "I mean, the man is an icon. He's 
bigger than any rock star. He's got the right stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most fevered reaction came from a man who didn't even manage to get 
Yeager's autograph. The handshake, though, suited him just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shook his hand! I shook his hand!" he called out to his wife, bursting 
through the crowd. "Did you see me get in there? It was so wild! Right after he 
shook my hand, he looked around and said, 'OK. I have to go now.' And so I was 
the last one!" 
</P>
<P>
 The man stopped and called after his wife, who moved away in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honey? You don't think I should wash this hand for a few days, do you?"

HIGH UTILITY RATES NOT REFLECTED IN BETTER SERVICES; PRICES: SURVEY FINDS 
WATER, SEWER AND TRASH COSTS VARY BY GEOGRAPHY AND POLICY. VENTURA IS COSTLY 
FOR HOMEOWNERS, BUT PORT HUENEME IS A COMPARATIVE BARGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura resident Shelli Brennan thinks there must be a cheaper place to live 
than her city by the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan is right. 
</P>
<P>
 The same amount of water, sewer and trash service that costs the Brennan 
family of five nearly $70 a month in Ventura would come to less than $60 in 
Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks and just $40 in Port Hueneme, which has the 
cheapest services of any city in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in Ojai and Westlake, where private companies supply water and sewer 
services, would the Brennans' bills be higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't like it," Brennan said. "But when you are forced to use them, what 
are you going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Brennan family bills have fallen victim to Ventura's public-works 
philosophy. Trying to encourage conservation, the city has constructed a tiered 
rating system that penalizes residents who throw away mounds of garbage and 
consume more than a modicum of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a public service they're doing," said Brennan, who orders her 
13-year-old to take shorter showers, turns off the faucet when she's brushing 
her teeth and lets her lawn go brown during the summer, all in an attempt to 
keep her water bills in check. "We'll just have to thank them." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of Ventura County's 10 cities and their service agencies shows that 
rates vary widely, although higher prices do not necessarily equal higher 
quality, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also showed that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Although Bailard Landfill dropped its dumping rates by 25% last year, none 
of the West County cities that send their garbage there lowered residents' 
trash rates in response.  
</P>
<P>
 * East County residents on average use twice as much water as their West 
County counterparts, a difference city officials attribute to the bigger lots 
and drier conditions east of the Camarillo Grade.  
</P>
<P>
 * Port Hueneme charges the lowest rates of any city in the county -- flat fees 
of $11 a month for water, $15 a month for sewer and $14.80 a month for trash. 
But Port Hueneme has no curbside recycling program and, its officials admit, 
very poor quality water.  
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Paula has no recycling program at all. City officials say they are 
studying the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many city officials and service providers discourage this kind of examination, 
which stacks one agency against another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to compare what's going on," said Tom Schiarodit, the 
recycling coordinator for E.J. Harrison & Sons, which is the trash hauler for 
most of western Ventura County. "There's a tremendous amount of variables." 
</P>
<P>
 But most homeowners don't read the city staff reports that explain such 
variables. All they see are their bills, some of which can seem exorbitant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know they're too high," grumbled Sam Briglio of Ojai. WATER 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Shaffer, a homeowner in Newbury Park, just can't understand why her 
family's water bills have skyrocketed in the last decade. These days, to keep a 
half acre of land green and well tended, she pays about $200 a month for water. 
And yes, she installed low-flow toilets and shower heads years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's annoying," she said. "I feel sorry for people on fixed incomes." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaffer is not exaggerating -- water costs have risen dramatically, 
particularly in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by inflation, tougher federal and state water standards, and the cost 
of building new facilities, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California, for example, has nearly doubled its charges in the last 10 years. 
The MWD is the primary or secondary water supplier to Thousand Oaks, Simi 
Valley, Moorpark, Oxnard and Camarillo. MWD water cost $224 per acre-foot in 
the 1985-86 fiscal year. It costs $412 per acre-foot today. (The average 
Southern California household uses about one-half acre-foot of water a year, 
MWD officials say.) 
</P>
<P>
 But across-the-board increases are not the only reason for customer 
dissatisfaction. Those who compare bills with their neighbors in other parts of 
the county -- or even in some cases, other parts of the city -- find they are 
paying more for the same product. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaffer, like her neighbors in Newbury Park, is served by the private 
California American Water Co., which receives MWD water through another 
intermediary. The city supplies water to the central third of Thousand Oaks and 
another private company services the Westlake area. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that a typical Conejo Valley household consumes 2,200 
cubic feet of water, or 16,456 gallons, each month. 
</P>
<P>
 By that standard, a typical California American Water customer would pay about 
$51.70. In central Thousand Oaks, that water bill would total only $40.83. To 
the north, in Fillmore, which has one of the lowest water rates in the county, 
the same customer would pay $25.30 for the water -- or less than half what 
California American charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say Thousand Oaks water is pricier because Conejo Valley agencies 
import every drop from the MWD, which gets it via the California Aqueduct from 
Northern California. In Fillmore, by contrast, a plethora of underground wells 
means the city can pump all its water locally, dramatically reducing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But that still leaves a large discrepancy between the rates of Newbury Park's 
private company and Thousand Oaks' public water agency. Officials in cities 
around the county say private agencies enjoy larger profit margins than their 
public counterparts. But California American officials say their company's 
costs are higher than those of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have other incomes, as a city might, to offset water rates," said 
Diane Anderson, California American's office manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Just because California American charges more than the city of Thousand Oaks 
doesn't mean its customers will use less water. Officials say consumption often 
depends more on geography and lifestyle than upon actual fees. 
</P>
<P>
 East County residents in general use more water than their West County 
counterparts -- about 16,500 gallons of water a month for the typical East 
County household, compared to about 6,700 in Ventura and approximately 10,500 
in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say this is because the East County is inland and dry and many 
East County residents are wealthier than their West County neighbors, with 
bigger homes and bigger lots. 
</P>
<P>
 High rates do not always translate into better water. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, officials in Port Hueneme attribute their low fees in part to the 
poor quality of the water they provide. The quality will rise, along with the 
rates, when the city begins mixing local well water with imported water in the 
next few years, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 But over in Ojai, Southern California Water Co. levies one of the highest 
residential fees in the county, yet some homeowners go to great lengths to 
avoid drinking the water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai City Councilwoman Nina Shelley said the water coming out of her pipes is 
practically unusable. She runs it through a water softener before she will let 
it flow through her faucets, and even then, it tastes so bad that she buys all 
her drinking water at the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Southern California Water say Shelley obviously can't handle 
organic water pumped straight out of the soil. Frank Bennett, the district 
superintendent, said he generally hears few complaints from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shelley remains unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't drink it for anything in the world," she declared. SEWER 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, there seems to be little rhyme or reason to sewage fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks residents who subscribe to the city's sewage agency pay 
$10.50 a month -- the least for waste water treatment of any homeowners in the 
county. By contrast, homeowners in neighboring Westlake pay $20.50 each month 
to the private Triunfo Sanitation District, and the county average is $17.96 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Nelson, Thousand Oaks' director of public works, said the city's low fees 
are no accident. In fact, the city has not raised its sewer rates since 1987, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said this is because, years ago, the city planned wisely. Officials 
established a savings account in the late 1960s, designed to fund construction 
of new facilities, and in the late 1970s began another fund that now pays for 
all replacement costs at the waste water-treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, by contrast, charges its homeowners double what Thousand Oaks does. 
John Elwell, Camarillo's director of community services, said that if the city 
had planned better years ago, perhaps its rates might be closer to those of its 
neighbor to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, Camarillo homeowners pay $21.06 each month in sewer fees, a large 
chunk of which goes for a construction project at the city's treatment plant.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like Camarillo and Thousand Oaks, most cities in the county simply charge a 
flat rate for sewer services -- except Ventura, which tiers its sewer rates 
just as it does its water rates. City officials explain that this is supposed 
to give residents -- in a city that suffered severe water shortages in the 
latest drought -- an extra incentive to cut back on use. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the average Ventura household, using 900 cubic feet of water a month, 
would pay only about $15 a month in sewer fees, city officials said. But if 
that customer used 1,500 cubic feet of water, which is closer to the usage of 
other residents in the county, the bill would rise to $23.65 a month, making it 
the second-highest sewage bill in the county, after Ojai.  
</P>
<P>
 Faced with this double whammy of high sewer and high water bills, many Ventura 
residents say they try to rein in their family's water usage. But it can get 
frustrating, some say, especially when the council votes in a new rate increase 
as it did in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it keeps going up, there's going to be an outcry," said Bob Rose, an 
accountant who lives and works in Ventura. "People are going to say 'Enough is 
enough.' " TRASH 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura officials say they are already getting an earful from residents irate 
about the city's latest trash rate hike. The fees went up last month to help 
pay for a new yard waste recycling program, but yard waste pickup did not start 
until this month.  
</P>
<P>
 Now Ventura homeowners pay about $2 extra on each trash bill. Where the 
haulers once picked up recycling rubbish every week, now they pick it up every 
other week, alternating it with yard waste pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said he can see how homeowners might be upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trash rates have generated some ongoing concern," he said. "I appreciate 
the fact that people don't like to pay that much. But as you get into the 
blow-by-blow process, however, that's where we've come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other cities that truck trash to Oxnard's Bailard Landfill, Ventura 
did not lower its rates when Bailard's dumping fees dropped early this year 
from $44.50 a ton to $33.50 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura officials said they anticipated the rate drop in 1993 and, as a 
result, did not raise residents' fees that year. Camarillo city staff said they 
responded by hiking trash charges less than they would have without the 
increase.  
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, some of the extra funds paid for new city programs like 
hazardous-waste collection days, which the county stopped providing when it 
dropped the fees at Bailard, city officials said. The rest of the savings were 
stashed in a reserve account for emergencies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In general, West County cities traditionally have charged more for trash 
services than East County cities. Officials used to explain away that 
difference by noting that the Simi Valley Landfill and other trash dumps in Los 
Angeles County charged substantially less than Bailard did. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the Simi Valley Landfill charges about the same as Bailard. And the 
price differences remain. 
</P>
<P>
 For $14.90 a month, a Simi Valley resident can throw away 90 gallons of 
garbage, 90 gallons of yard waste and an unlimited amount of recyclables. For 
$17.60 a month, a Thousand Oaks homeowner can set out on the curb four 
45-gallon trash cans and unlimited recyclables. 
</P>
<P>
 Over in the West County, the prices are steeper. An Oxnard resident paying 
$17.17 a month receives only a 60-gallon trash can and a basket for 
recyclables, under which bagged newspapers can be stacked. To receive service 
similar to that which Simi Valley residents enjoy for less than $15, an Ojai 
homeowner must shell out $21.65 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme is the only West County city that provides more than 40 gallons 
of trash service a week for less than $18 a month. The catch is, for the city's 
flat fee of $14.80 a month, residents must haul their own recyclables to one of 
15 centers dotted about the city. 
</P>
<P>
 West County officials say they are mystified as to why the East County cities 
can charge so little and provide so much service.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, said Steve Chase, Ventura's environmental affairs coordinator, his 
city needs to re-examine its rate structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to me to be no excuse for why we seem to be out of line," he 
said. "If we are more expensive, then we need to address that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, every city is steps ahead of Santa Paula, which has no municipal 
recycling program at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've sat here and debated, 'When do we make the jump?' " said Norman 
Wilkinson, Santa Paula's public works director. 
</P>
<P>
 Because state law stipulates that cities must reduce the trash they dump at 
the landfill by 25% by 1995, Santa Paula plans to make the jump soon. For the 
last four years, city officials have kept one nervous eye on that percentage 
and another on the county recycling situation, waiting to see which city would 
build a trash-sorting center and come to Santa Paula's rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 No one did. Today, less than three months shy of the target year, Santa Paula 
residents are still free to set out as much garbage as the curb can hold, and 
any recycling they do is their own business.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, much to Wilkinson's surprise, the county reports that Santa 
Paula is making great progress toward the 1995 goal. County figures released 
last winter show that Santa Paula has reduced its landfill dumping by 28% since 
1990, though the city's best estimate is 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sure where those numbers come from," he said. "We're not sure how 
accurate they are." And, he added, "they are one more reason" not to spend more 
money on recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is the inevitability of it all that frustrates many residents -- -- that no 
matter how much they try to conserve, or how much outside companies lower their 
fees, their bills continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we have to recycle everything, where is all the money going to?" 
asks Ojai resident Sam Briglio. "That never comes back. The rates just keep 
going up." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials across the county say they sympathize and are doing the best they 
can. In Simi Valley, they brag about their thrifty trash-hauling contract. In 
Thousand Oaks, officials applaud their ability to keep sewage fees so low.  
</P>
<P>
 But rising expenses and increasing regulation, city leaders say, mean that 
ultimately, no one will escape higher bills in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate the fact that people don't like to pay that much," Ventura Mayor 
Buford said. "But it's probably going to cost more in the future." Your Cost

ELECTIONS / VENTURA'S MEASURE E; CLOSED STREET DIVIDES SCHOOL, RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the lunch bell rings, Aron Ruiz and dozens of his classmates pile out of 
the Ventura High School weight room and head across Poli Street toward the 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring the painted crosswalk, the teen-agers cut a broad diagonal from curb 
to curb and even saunter down the middle of the avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 They act as if they own the street. In a way, they do. 
</P>
<P>
 A normally busy thoroughfare, the four-block stretch of Poli Street that 
bisects the high school campus has been closed to traffic during school hours 
since early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council acted swiftly to close Poli Street in the wake of community 
outrage over the after-school stabbing death of a Ventura High student. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and school officials say the closure has helped keep dangerous 
intruders off campus and cut down on traffic noise, dramatically improving the 
campus environment. 
</P>
<P>
 As 16-year-old Aron said: "It's dumb to have a street running through the 
middle of a school." 
</P>
<P>
 But a feisty group of residents from the hillside above Ventura High is 
fighting to reverse the council decision, sponsoring a ballot initiative called 
Measure E that would reopen Poli Street immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative's proponents say the closure of Poli Street clogs traffic on 
Main Street, obstructs emergency vehicles entering the area, and forces 
hillside residents to drive far out of their way to get around their own 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 They are angry not only about the metal gates shutting off Poli Street from 
7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. every day, but also the chain-rope barricades that are 
put up during the same hours on two nearby residential streets -- Sunset Drive 
and Palomar Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillside residents requested the Sunset and Palomar barricades after the 
closure of Poli Street, when hundreds of motorists detoured onto the quiet and 
narrow streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But what they really want, Measure E proponents say, is to reopen Poli Street 
so they can get rid of the chain-ropes blocking residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not against the school," said Hazel Imbrecht, a hillside resident 
whose children graduated from Ventura High. "We've supported the school all 
these years. But it seems that right now we live in a gated community that we 
didn't ask for." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the Measure E campaign moves into its final weeks, the fight between 
the two groups is growing nastier. The camps tend to split down generational 
lines, with parents and students working against the measure and many elderly 
neighbors hoping to reopen the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative's proponents accuse parents and school officials of ignoring 
possible alternatives to the street closure, such as fencing in the entire 
campus, building an overpass for traffic along Poli Street or simply installing 
a new stoplight. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what the solution . . . there's always a reason why it won't work," 
said real estate broker David Gladstone, president of Concerned Citizens of 
Ventura, which is pushing Measure E. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura High parents contend, meanwhile, that the initiative's backers are 
running a deceptive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Measure E supporters are using the school colors -- black and gold -- in 
what opponents consider a deliberate attempt to mislead voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides driving a pickup truck fitted with a huge black-and-gold placard 
proclaiming "Open Poli -- Yes on E," members of Concerned Citizens of Ventura 
are also distributing flyers in the same colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying to have people think that if they vote what the yellow and 
black says it's for Ventura High School," said Valerie Chrisman, whose son 
attends the school. "I think they thought it was a good political technique to 
use the school colors and confuse the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gladstone responds, "That's nonsense." His group picked the school colors, 
he said, because the issue is, after all, about Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the group failed to put its name or address on the first batch of 
flyers, running afoul of the state elections code. 
</P>
<P>
 For parents and school officials, the issue is clear-cut: They have tried to 
close Poli Street for 30 years and now they want to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the main problems were traffic safety and noise, school officials 
said. In the eight classrooms facing Poli Street, the rumble from passing cars 
is so loud that teachers have kept their doors and windows closed even in 
sweltering heat, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years the concerns have grown more serious. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges, which decides on schools' 
accreditation, recommended during its regular review of Ventura High that the 
school should seal off Poli Street, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on the street had increased over the years to about 10,000 cars per 
day, 4,000 of them during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 And as gang activity in the city has shot up, so has the number of 
gang-related incidents along Poli Street. School officials said the street is a 
favorite thoroughfare for youths who want to flash gang signs or pick fights 
with Ventura High students. 
</P>
<P>
 During one particularly violent nine-day period a few years ago, officials 
said, intruders who had parked on Poli Street assaulted 12 students in addition 
to three staff members trying to break up the fights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Bob Dixon recalls one Monday morning two years ago when he and his 
first-period physics class watched in horror as a group of boys ran onto the 
campus from Poli Street after spotting another youth they had apparently been 
trying to find. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Dixon ran out to break up the scuffle, the youths were beating the 
student with a tire iron, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Ventura Unified School District had been asking the city for 
years to close Poli Street, the council only agreed after the stabbing death of 
a Ventura High student in January, 1993. Jesse Strobel was stabbed and killed 
on a Friday evening several blocks from the school. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was ever charged in the attack. But school officials said they believe 
the killing stemmed from tensions between Jesse's friends and another group of 
students at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the closing, officials said, violence is less prevalent and the 
atmosphere at the school is markedly different. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are a little more relaxed," math teacher Lloyd Vadnais said. "You 
don't have the constant fear that something's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But Measure E proponents argue that school officials have exaggerated the 
dangers posed by Poli Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has ever been killed," Imbrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, the initiative's backers say, the school district and City Council have 
minimized the problems caused by closing the street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Main Street, for instance, has become a traffic nightmare because of motorists 
detoured from using Poli Street. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer Rick Raives confirmed that Main Street now carries thousands 
more cars daily than before the street closure. "It's certainly a lot busier," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the intersection of Seaward and Main streets is particularly congested, he 
said, with motorists sometimes having to sit through two or more lights during 
the busy noon hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillside residents also complain that the road closures are dangerous: Fire 
engines and other emergency vehicles, they said, will have trouble reaching 
hillside residences in the event of a big brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could have a terrible loss of life and everything else all because of 
those darn barricades," Measure E proponent Jack C. Biller said. 
</P>
<P>
 But this fear is contradicted by Ventura Fire Chief Richard Achee. "Our 
response time isn't slowed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternative to closing Poli Street, Biller and other backers of the 
initiative have suggested that the city and school district put a stoplight at 
the crosswalk on Poli, fence the campus in or take other measures to protect 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials, however, say neither a stoplight nor a fence would ease the 
disturbances caused by having a street cut through the middle of campus. 
</P>
<P>
 And district officials said they lack the hundreds of thousands of dollars it 
would cost to build an overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The district maintains, however, that it is continuing to search for a 
permanent solution to the Poli Street dilemma. Parents and officials said they 
just want voters to keep the street closed until they find another answer. 
</P>
<P>
 At least some voters are having trouble making up their mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellie Morgan and her husband Paul live on the hillside above Ventura High, 
but on the other side of Catalina Street. The 80-year-old Morgan, whose son is 
an assistant principal in the school district, said she sympathizes with 
Measure E proponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real darn inconvenience for them," she said. "But, on the other hand, 
Mr. Morgan and I are both ambivalent about this because the kids have to cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a real lousy situation overall."

AFFAIR TO REMEMBER; THOUSAND OAKS PUTS ON THE RITZ FOR CIVIC ARTS PLAZA'S 
CHRISTENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In their blue sequined gowns and starched tuxedos, in their long velvet capes 
and crisp dark suits, the guests clustered inside the lavender lobby of the 
Civic Arts Plaza and chatted -- about traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Or rather, the lack of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 They exclaimed over the easy trip down the Ventura Freeway. The smooth flow on 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard. The hassle-free parking in the well-lit garage. 
</P>
<P>
 From Camarillo, Simi Valley, Agoura Hills, even Canoga Park, they had flocked 
to opening night of Thousand Oaks' razzle-dazzle theater -- and they professed 
themselves awed at the sheer convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always had to drive down to Los Angeles for everything," Thousand Oaks 
resident Roxana Veltze said. "This is just grand." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Tony, looked a little aghast at his wife's enthusiasm. "We want 
to keep this hush-hush," he reminded her, only partially kidding. "We don't 
want everyone to know about this." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday and Saturday, it seemed everyone already knew. Thousand Oaks' 
Probst Auditorium hosted sell-out crowds both evenings for splashy 
grand-opening concerts featuring the Conejo Symphony Orchestra and Broadway 
star Bernadette Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many spectators agreed with Councilwoman Judy Lazar, who addressed the Friday 
night audience with a simple, heartfelt exclamation: "Aren't we lucky?" Before 
leaving the stage to the musicians, Lazar vowed, "We'll be back many times to 
party here together." 
</P>
<P>
 For this weekend's party, Thousand Oaks rolled out the red carpet. Guests 
emerging from the parking garage strode down a short red carpet into a crowded 
plaza, where a trombone-and-synthesizer duo struggled to be heard above the 
excited buzz. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a black-tie party Saturday for major donors, hundreds of people sipped 
champagne and nibbled on salmon and ham hors d'oeuvres. Architect Antoine 
Predock roamed the crowd, beaming and pausing to peer out windows and admire 
every facet of the building he designed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fantastic," Predock said. "It's a whole sort of adventure. People are 
using the places in this building like I never imagined." 
</P>
<P>
 On both evenings, patrons stood in lines a dozen deep at the bar to order 
drinks, and on Saturday mimes with their faces painted white entertained the 
crowd with exaggerated gestures befitting the blow-out party. 
</P>
<P>
 The lines at the bar were the only place there appeared to be a traffic jam 
before Saturday's performance. Outside along Thousand Oaks Boulevard and in the 
plaza's main parking lot, cars moved along at an efficient clip. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking attendant John Wimiarski said the black-tie crowd kept valet parking 
attendants twice as busy as Friday night. There were "about 10 Rolls Royces and 
half the annual production of Mercedes Benz," he quipped. "I'm running lots 
more. There's definitely more fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
 John and Emily Freeman of Newbury Park -- who chose to park their car 
themselves -- found time to pause in the parking structure to consider the 
Chumash-inspired mosaic on the plaza's west wall. 
</P>
<P>
 John Freeman said the plaza is "so attractive and so convenient. We thought we 
were going to be late. I kept telling my wife to hurry up, but it looks like 
we'll have time for an extra glass for champagne." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the weekend's celebrations, party-goers expressed pride and 
pleasure over the sprawling new complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that will make Thousand Oaks really special," Noomi 
Wennbergsaid.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like many longtime Thousand Oaks residents, Wennberg and her husband, Jan, 
recalled bringing their children to the Jungleland wild animal park -- now the 
site of the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Curving rows of lilac seats have replaced the rusty lion cages, and a 
well-groomed park has covered the dried-up lagoon. But to some, the Civic Arts 
Plaza still retains echoes of Jungleland -- as a popular attraction sure to 
bring fame and fun to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very proud of our city," Clarence Chatman said. A Thousand Oaks 
resident for 18 years, Chatman patiently held a stack of coats while his wife, 
daughter and neighbor took turns snapping photos of themselves in the packed 
auditorium lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Cora Chatman declared: "This event is very chic. Very elegant." All that 
elegance, however, bothered Madeline Adinoff just a tad. After all, Thousand 
Oaks prides itself on maintaining a small-town atmosphere -- and Adinoff wanted 
her city to uphold that reputation, in spite of the Broadway glitter. 
</P>
<P>
 So Adinoff parked herself at the door and welcomed every guest who looked her 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the official greeter," she said. "I'm doing this for the love of the 
city, the people, the arts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Adinoff's greetings expressed Thousand Oaks' style, so did the brief 
ribbon-cutting ceremony before Friday's concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Alex Fiore and council members Judy Lazar and Frank Schillo addressed 
the crowd of 1,800, earning a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although council members Elois Zeanah and Jaime Zukowski attended Saturday's 
festivities, the two women -- the arts plaza's most outspoken critics -- did 
not show up for Friday's official opening. Their conspicuous absence from the 
podium underscored just how deeply -- and how bitterly -- the $86-million 
project has split the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore, who will retire next month after 30 years on the council, could not 
resist calling attention to that schism on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This first night has been a success by at least a 3-0 vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, too, used his welcoming speech to dwell on politics -- especially a 
1991 recall drive, when foes of the Civic Arts Plaza sought to oust him and 
Fiore from office. "You did not sign that petition," he told the audience 
members. "If you had, we wouldn't be here tonight." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As soon as the politicians cleared the stage, symphony conductor Elmer Ramsey 
strode to his podium, and the orchestra launched into the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernadette Peters swooped into the spotlight after intermission decked out in 
a shimmery gold-and-white gown. 
</P>
<P>
 In a performance that delighted the crowd, Peters sang and shimmied and even 
waltzed into the audience. She belted out "We're in the Money" in pig Latin. 
And later she invited the orchestra musicians to join her on the chorus of "The 
Glow Worm." 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage, light technicians got to strut their stuff with a whole program of 
special effects. They flashed yellow, green and red spotlights on stage and 
sent a ripple of bubblelike white spots across the auditorium walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Stage crews did not, however, get to show off the hall's vaunted acoustics. 
Peters brought her own speakers, which screeched a bit and failed to reach some 
spectators in the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, nothing could dampen the crowd's enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fabulous," Thousand Oaks resident Sharon Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bernadette Peters does a great job," her friend Mary Hansen agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters' biggest crowd-pleaser came toward the beginning of the show, when she 
proudly rattled off a few facts she had memorized about Thousand Oaks. She 
praised the auditorium as "lovely" and the orchestra as "luscious." 
</P>
<P>
 "Congratulations," Peters told the audience. "I'm so glad you recognize the 
importance of having performing arts centers. We need to have places where the 
soul can be fed -- and where I can work." 
</P>

ELECTIONS / SIMI VALLEY SCHOOL BOARD; CANDIDATES FOCUS ON LOOMING DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The six candidates seeking two open seats on Simi Valley's school board agree 
that the city's school district is facing some of its most crucial issues in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators are searching for ways to balance the district's $75.5-million 
budget without hurting classroom programs. Parents and school leaders are 
pushing for ways to bolster safety in the wake of a fatal on-campus stabbing 
earlier this year. And the district is looking to improve the overall quality 
of education in the city's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six candidates, all but the one incumbent agree on another point: 
Internal bickering and divisiveness have dogged the five-member panel the past 
two years, they say, hampering the district's efforts to resolve some of its 
most pressing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would describe the current school board as five individuals unable to 
decide what are the priorities of the school community," candidate Sharon 
Hushka said. "I really believe the board has to find ways to work together and 
set the tone for the whole district." 
</P>
<P>
 Hushka, Janice DiFatta, Jacquie Richardson, Norm Walker, Glenn Woodbury and 
incumbent board President Carla Kurachi are seeking seats in the Nov. 8 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The five challengers hope to monopolize what they call the board's tarnished 
reputation by assuring voters that they will put an end to the political 
squabbling and listen to parents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 DiFatta, 42, a homemaker, is a member of the Simi Valley PTA Council. She 
wants to make schools safer by sending "troublemakers" to alternative school 
sites, and advocates a "back-to-basics" style of education, which emphasizes 
core academics. 
</P>
<P>
 Hushka, 35, who writes children's literature, has opposed the school board's 
decision to charge parents for bus service. She supports conflict resolution 
programs as a method of curbing campus violence. A critic of back-to-basics 
education, Hushka advocates teaching critical thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, 43, an employment and training consultant, ran unsuccessfully for 
the school board in 1992. She said she decided to run again this year because 
she is frustrated by the current board's bickering. Her top concern is the 
budget, which she would reduce by seeking government grants and restructuring 
employees' health benefits packages. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, 43, a minister and administrator of a private Baptist school, 
describes himself as a conservative candidate. He criticized board members at 
last week's meeting for opposing Proposition 187, saying the board should not 
take positions on social issues. He also supports a back-to-basics approach to 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbury, 40, who owns a weather-stripping company, is a former test 
supervisor for Natel Engineering Co. Inc. He was a whistle-blower in a 1990 
federal lawsuit against Natel stemming from reported problems with the defense 
firm's electronic circuit testing. The suit was settled last year when the Simi 
Valley company pleaded guilty to defense-contract fraud and paid $2.2 million 
in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbury has been involved in several local issues, including leading a 
community effort to remove pornographic magazines from local news racks. He 
describes himself as a politically conservative candidate who advocates strict 
academic programs and school safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent candidate, Kurachi, 41, is a career counselor at Cal State 
Northridge. She supports programs that encourage critical thinking and says her 
experience on the board will be valuable in addressing a new round of budget 
cuts next year. 
</P>
<P>
 All six candidates say a projected budget deficit of $3.2 million is the 
biggest crisis facing Simi Valley's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public forum last week, Walker blamed board members for the district's 
financial crisis and accused them of mismanaging funds. "I think the current 
board has to be held accountable for the budget problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kurachi defended the board, blaming the district's financial woes on 
diminishing state funds. She later shot down suggestions to streamline employee 
health care packages, saying, "We've already reduced health care benefits 
packages by 20%." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for other creative solutions to balance the budget, candidates have 
suggested selling surplus district property, freezing salaries and travel 
expenses, and pursuing state and federal education grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district has operated four years without a cost-of-living increase 
for its employees, and has run a deficit for about the same period of time, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Ventura County school officials told district leaders they must show 
specific steps being taken to balance the budget by Dec. 31, or the county 
would take over management of the district's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said the district has already moved to close the 
budget gap, taking measures such as transferring about $450,000 from the adult 
school budget to the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But school board candidates have seized on the warning from the county as an 
indication of the board's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without making cuts in our budget we will lose all local control," Richardson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue the candidates have raised is school safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley community was stunned earlier this year when a 14-year-old 
Valley View Junior High School student was fatally stabbed in the school's 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley View has since adopted a conflict-resolution program and a strict dress 
code in an attempt to make the campus safer. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates have generally agreed that similar programs and, dress codes as 
well as strict enforcement of school rules will promote safe campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a problem with a small percentage of the youth in the 
community," DiFatta said. "I think the schools need to do their job by 
providing consistent enforcement of the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before any steps are taken to balance budgets or curb campus crimes, 
candidates say the board must improve communication with the community and stop 
its internal bickering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to stop the finger-pointing and bickering," Richardson said during a 
forum last week. "We have to rebuild trust and respect on our school board." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics point to the unsuccessful recall effort launched last year to oust 
board members Kurachi, Debbie Sandland and Diane Collins as an example of 
parents' frustration over the board's inability to agree on subjects such as 
school configuration and sex education. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kurachi said trustees have set their differences aside this year, 
eventually coming together to unanimously approve a new birth-control 
curriculum -- one of the most volatile issues the group has tackled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a very passionate group and things sometimes do get heated," Kurachi 
said. "We might bicker now and then, but people were sick and tired of a 
rubber-stamp board." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Nov. 8 election nears, the dissension characteristic of past board 
meetings has emerged in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Hushka and Kurachi refused to participate in a forum sponsored last week by 
Citizens for Truth in Education, a conservative parents' group, saying it was 
politically biased. DiFatta refused to be interviewed by the Simi Educator's 
Assn.'s endorsement committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Also last week, anonymous flyers tagging Hushka and Kurachi as liberals and 
weak leaders were placed on parents' cars during a PTA-sponsored forum. Kurachi 
said she believes the attack was launched by the "radical right," conservative 
residents she says are trying to discredit her. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, conservative Christian groups across the state have launched 
political campaigns to get like-minded people elected to public office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simi Valley school board race, some candidates contend that 
conservative Christian groups are campaigning behind the scenes to get 
candidates elected who share their positions on issues such as sex education. 
</P>
<P>
 All six candidates in the race were surveyed by the Pro-Family Caucus of 
Ventura County and the Christian Coalition of Eastern Ventura County for a 
voting guide published late last week by the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbury and Walker were the only two Simi Valley school board candidates who 
responded to questions posed by the group on issues such as condom 
distribution, the California Learning Assessment System and school vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Walker said he is not a member of either of the organizations 
that sponsored the guide. "I am conservative, but I am also independent," 
Walker said, adding, "I am not a part of any slate or any faction." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbury has said he is a Christian and politically conservative but is not a 
member of any organized Christian political group. 
</P>
<P>
 As the election nears, some parents say they are weary of the discord that has 
characterized the school board and the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for a board that won't embarrass me," said parent Debbi Mjoen, 
who attended the PTA forum last week. "I think the Simi Valley parents are 
ready for a change." 
</P>
<P>
 So, apparently, are some students. Although they cannot vote on Election Day, 
about 10 Simi Valley teen-agers attended the Citizens for Truth in Education's 
forum last week to learn more about the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard anything I think is very positive," said Katie Hall, a junior 
at Royal High School who believes class size and students' rights are issues 
that have not been addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not going to serve my needs," she said. "They are going for what the 
voters want to hear." Simi Valley Unified School District 
</P>
<P>
 Six candidates, including one incumbent, are running for two seats on Simi 
Valley's Board of Education. Among the key issues are school safety, raising 
academic standards and balancing the $75.5-million budget in the 27-campus 
district, which has about 18,500 students.

COUNTY MAY OPEN PARKS TO CHILD CARE; SOCIAL SERVICES: PLAN WOULD OFFER CENTERS 
THE USE OF PLAYGROUND AREAS FOR LOW FEE. IT COULD AFFECT UP TO 90 SITES AND 
SERVE 150,000 CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a shortage of affordable child care, land-rich Los Angeles 
County may allow some groups that want to open new day-care centers to share in 
its wealth of open space and playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal by Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the county would charge a 
relatively low rental fee for space in up to 90 neighborhood parks scattered in 
unincorporated areas stretching from the Antelope Valley to East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea has previously become reality in other jurisdictions, including the 
cities of Los Angeles and Pasadena, where poor children attend Head Start 
preschool programs in a handful of municipal parks. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are studying the proposal and are expected to report to the 
Board of Supervisors in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening up the parks would mean that some of the estimated 150,000 children in 
the county who lack day care would have a place to go, said Kathy Malaske-Samu, 
the county's child care coordinator and the idea's strongest supporter. Instead 
of spending months searching for affordable sites that meet stringent state 
requirements for ample outdoor space, center operators would be able to quickly 
install portable classrooms in a corner of a park and begin enrolling children, 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Head Start, the federally funded, nonprofit program for 
preschoolers of low-income families, believe the proposal could save taxpayers 
tens of thousands of dollars in rental fees in future years. 
</P>
<P>
 But before a single center opens in a county park, officials must make sure 
that the centers would not deprive the general public of parkland or draw 
opposition from local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if no resistance surfaces, the county must overcome a legal obstacle of 
its own making. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1956, Los Angeles County won an appellate court ruling that allowed it to 
respond to neighborhood complaints by evicting a private nursery school it had 
previously permitted in a West Hollywood park. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, which still stands, prohibits the use of a county park in any way 
that interferes with access by the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 Today county officials contend that using parkland for child care centers 
would actually increase the public's access to parks. Unlike the 1950s, when 
single-parent families were less common and most women did not work outside the 
home, child care has become a critical social need, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to recognize that there are huge demographic differences between 
1956 and 1994," Malaske-Samu said. "These days, parks are underused between 9 
and 5 on weekdays because so many parents are working." 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys familiar with the ruling say that either legislative action 
overturning the 38-year-old court ruling or very careful legal footwork will be 
necessary before the county can open its parks to the centers. Even if it is 
ultimately allowed, the program is likely to be restricted to nonprofit child 
care providers, as it is in other cities, said F. C. Buchter, an attorney for 
the state Department of Parks and Recreation who has studied the decision. 
</P>

 In Pasadena, about 65 preschoolers in the city's poorest neighborhood go to a 
child care center in a public park. The city donates two classrooms in the 
Villa-Park Community Center to Head Start to care for low-income 3- and 
4-year-olds. Head Start pays for its own utilities and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pasadena probably would not allow center operators to install portable 
classrooms in its other 30 parks, said Anne Broussard, the city's child care 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as we'd like to put up portables for child care, we have a mandate 
about the preservation of green space," Broussard said. "A lot of parks are all 
booked up by football and soccer leagues as it is. It would be tough to take 
kids on a picnic if all the space is being used." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, officials in the master-planned city of Irvine in Orange County 
encourage the use of their parks for child care centers, going so far as to 
zone them specifically for that use. The city operates day care programs for 
about 400 school-age children in five community parks and also leases space in 
one park to a nonprofit nursery school.  
</P>
<P>
 "The thrust in the '90s is that government should help facilitate the private 
sector in providing child care," said Nancy Noble, Irvine's child care 
coordinator.  
</P>
<P>
 In the city of Los Angeles, the parks department is licensed to provide child 
care for 1,000 children in 18 of its 125 parks, said John Pawlek, a supervisor 
for the parks department. Head Start also leases space in city parks for 12 
other centers, said Frank Lorah, Head Start manager for the county Office of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Head Start pays anywhere from $1 a year to rent space in some city parks to 
$3,000 for privately owned facilities, Lorah said. In the next 15 to 20 years, 
the need for space will grow as millions of federal dollars to expand the 
program are expected to pour into the county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Landlords who know Head Start is expanding are charging us 15(%) to 20% more 
than in the past," Lorah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Parks Director Rod Cooper said the county does not know how 
much it will charge to lease park space, but does not expect to make money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of a service thing," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suitable locations often are difficult to find regardless of price, Lorah 
said. Head Start has a backlog of about 1,700 children for whom it has not been 
able to find space, partly because the state requires that operators provide 75 
square feet of outdoor space per child, Lorah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike densely populated commercial or residential areas, parks usually have 
ample open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a great opportunity to be able to use the county parks," Lorah 
said.

LESBIAN COUPLE PURSUE DREAM DESPITE DANGER; PREJUDICE: PAIR ARE TRYING TO RAISE 
FUNDS AND SUPPORT FOR A FEMINIST RETREAT IN MISSISSIPPI, WHERE NEIGHBORS HAVE 
RESPONDED WITH THREATS, HARASSMENT AND LAWSUITS.

<P>
 It was somehow appropriate that the lesbian couple from Ovett, Miss., should 
be eating shrimp fettuccine in Robin Tyler's San Fernando Valley kitchen last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it was a women's festival produced by Tyler that helped set Brenda 
and Wanda Henson on the path to Ovett, a sandy speck of country where dreams 
and fear, defiance and gunfire have come to mark their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women, who use the same last name, are trying to establish a feminist 
education retreat called Camp Sister Spirit on a former hog farm. The notion is 
downright demonic to many of their neighbors, who have responded with 
harassment, threats and lawsuits. The clash has drawn federal mediators, talk 
show hosts and the national press, but so far, no resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about the time you think it's OK, then something else will happen," says 
Brenda, who, with Wanda, has been in Los Angeles over the last week meeting 
with gay groups and activists as part of a monthlong trip around the country to 
raise money and support for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the last year, they have recorded 64 incidents. In the first, a dead 
female dog -- shot in the stomach -- and a sanitary napkin were draped over 
their mailbox. Last Thanksgiving Day someone tossed a note on their driveway. 
It read: "Leave qeer's (sic) now." On Christmas Night, a man phoned to inform 
them they would be dead before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they have been chased off the road and shot at. They have lost nine 
tires to spikes tossed on the half-mile drive to their 120-acre property. They 
have received bomb threats and dozens of vulgar, harassing phone calls a day. A 
dead copperhead snake was left at their gate. 
</P>
<P>
 They now own a shotgun, a .30-30 rifle and a security gate. They try not to go 
anywhere alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they have no intention of leaving Ovett. "I'm a home girl. I ain't going 
nowhere," says Wanda, who was raised in a Pentecostal household and has lived 
all of her 39 years in southeastern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair met a decade ago doing abortion clinic defense work. Both were the 
divorced mothers of two children. Brenda had been married four times. "I tried 
and tried and it just didn't work," she says. Once was enough for Wanda, who 
had married, had children and obtained a nursing degree by the age of 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months after meeting they were living together. Within a year they were 
bold enough to venture north to a Georgia women's festival organized by Tyler, 
a comic and gay activist who produces women's events around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I left the festival I went up to Robin and said, 'I want you to know 
something. You have changed my life forever,' " says Wanda, who is now a 
veritable fount of feminist movement jargon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure what they were saying because they had these thick Southern 
accents," says Tyler, who helped raise $10,000 for the camp at a festival last 
year and at whose North Hills home the couple stayed for several days last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when Tyler heard news accounts of the harassment and called to suggest 
they might consider leaving, the women reminded her that in a roundabout way, 
they were in Ovett because of her. 
</P>
<P>
 They had returned from the Georgia festival transformed. They mortgaged their 
house and opened Mississippi's "first and only" feminist bookstore, which 
evolved into a community crisis center and food bank as well. 
</P>
<P>
 With some advice from Tyler, they also organized their own women's festivals 
on the Gulf Coast. Weary of the problems they had in leasing sites for the 
events, they began raising money to buy land. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually they found something they could afford, a wooded, creek-crossed 
piece of Ovett, a hamlet of 200 people and a handful of buildings about 80 
miles north of the coast. They bought the tract last year for $60,000 and 
started work on Camp Sister Spirit. It would be devoted to education, advocacy 
and counseling on a potpourri of social issues, ranging from racism, sexism and 
homophobia to religious freedom, ecology and oppression of fat people. 
</P>
<P>
 They mailed out a newsletter boasting of their progress and a new shower "nice 
enough for two." Residents got hold of copies and didn't like what they read. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead dog appeared. At first the Hensons didn't even realize they were the 
target. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was a message to our daughter," said Brenda, whose 28-year-old 
daughter has done advocacy work for police brutality victims. 
</P>
<P>
 It soon became apparent just who the intended targets were. Two town meetings 
were called about the retreat. An opinion piece in the Hattiesburg newspaper 
warned that the camp was "the tip of the iceberg that sinks the Titanic" and 
called on readers to take action to "rid our county of this blight on our 
land." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were more threats and harassment, enough to prompt the Hensons to 
request federal intervention. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno asked the FBI to 
investigate a mail threat and sent federal civil rights mediators to Ovett. It 
was the first gay harassment case for the mediation team -- and it was not 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp opponents not only declined to participate in mediation, they sued 
Reno, saying she had overstepped her authority. The action was later dropped, 
but a group of neighbors also filed a nuisance suit against the camp, saying 
the retreat would generate noise and traffic and would constitute a moral 
nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents have offered to buy the Hensons' land and relocate the camp to an 
urban area. It's one thing to be homosexual, they say, quite another to open a 
center that would turn a placid patch of the Bible Belt into "Lesbianville, 
USA, South," as one pastor has put it. 
</P>
<P>
 David Daniels, the Hensons' Biloxi attorney, has countersued for fees and 
damages in the nuisance action, which he terms "pretty ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Hensons can raise the money for legal expenses, Daniels also hopes to 
use a century-old anti-Ku Klux Klan law to sue the Jones County sheriff and the 
group crusading against the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheriff really needs to be held accountable in the courts," Daniels said. 
"He deliberately evades his responsibility in respect to my clients." The 
Hensons have complained repeatedly that the sheriff's department has failed to 
adequately investigate their complaints or to make arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels further faults the performance of the FBI and the U.S. attorney's 
office in Mississippi. "I'm no bleeding-heart liberal . . . but I can't believe 
what I'm seeing," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 The case is not about being gay, he says. It is about the right to freedom of 
speech and association, to live without fear and to own property. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of Sheriff Maurice Hooks heightened this month, when two gay men 
were found shot to death in the county. The sheriff, saying robbery appeared to 
be the motive, has dismissed suggestions of a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooks could not be reached for comment on Daniels' complaints. The U.S. 
attorney's office in Mississippi referred inquiries to the Justice Department 
in Washington, which confirmed an investigation into the mail threat. 
Information about its outcome was not readily available. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying both cases are the limits of federal civil rights laws, which do 
not protect people on the basis of sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that the hate crime law does in regard to gay and lesbian 
people is keep statistics on us when we're dead," Brenda says sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the couple's aim, she continues, is to raise awareness "about the fact 
that (gay) people are living this false sense of security all over the country. 
They believe they have civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Repeating a favorite phrase of her partner, Wanda says, "You kicked this soap 
box under my feet, now I'm going to take a stand on it."

MOURNERS PACK MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR JASMIN COOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pine-paneled country church overflowed Saturday with mourners for 
20-year-old Jasmin Marie Cook, whose family said they harbored no animosity for 
the young neighbor accused of running her down in his pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter is dead," Tyra Cook said following the memorial service, tears 
streaming down her face. "If I don't have any anger, why should anybody else?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cook and her husband, Edward, said they were saddened that 25-year-old Shane 
Young, who could face manslaughter and drunk-driving charges in connection with 
the fatal accident, decided not to attend the emotional service. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should have been here like everybody else who came to celebrate my 
daughter's life," Tyra Cook said. "He did not come because he did not want to 
incite any violent reaction in people who may blame him for what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother said that Young -- who investigators say was racing another vehicle 
on Silverado Canyon Road last Sunday when he struck Jasmin -- lived nearby and 
was one of her daughter's many friends. Jasmin Cook was walking with two others 
along the narrow canyon road when she was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately following the accident, Cook said, Young "dropped to the ground" 
in anguish near her daughter's body and "now carries that pain forever." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way you can change what happened," said Edward Cook. "Accidents 
happen. God wanted my daughter, and he took her." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, a chronic speeder with enough tickets to have forced the revocation of 
his license earlier this year, was released Friday from Orange County Jail 
after authorities said they needed more time to prepare criminal charges 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his driving record, Young was allowed to remain on the road because he 
was included in a state research program that studied how habitually negligent 
drivers are punished. Friday, the state Department of Motor Vehicles announced 
it will cancel the research program following public outrage over Young's 
special driving status. 
</P>
<P>
 At the memorial service Saturday, family and friends pointed to the tragic 
accident as a reason to unite what, residents said, is an often-troubled 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his daughter's death, Edward Cook said, Jasmin was "just getting her 
life back together" from serious bouts with drug use. He said other canyon kids 
have withdrawn into unhealthy cliques, with some caught up in such things as 
"devil worship." 
</P>
<P>
 "We should take this opportunity to become a community of family, not a 
community of slanderers and strangers," he said from the church rostrum. "We 
should take this opportunity to know each other. It's unfortunate that it took 
my daughter's life to bring this out. We should stick together. I'll do it for 
you. You do it for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The father's words brought loud applause from the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 The front and rear of the church contained photographs of the straw-haired 
young woman, and tables in the church vestibule were laden with mementos 
tracking her growth from infancy. 
</P>
<P>
 On another side of the church's tiny entry was displayed an open letter from 
Shana Cook, written after her sister's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jasmin was so special to me," the letter began. "I miss her so much. I know 
that everybody else misses her, too. I know that God is taking good care of her 
and that she is so happy. I know that she was not happy here and God just had 
to do what he had to do to make her happy." 
</P>
<P>
 In another letter written two years ago at Christmastime, Tyra Cook talked of 
how her daughter had become "a blessing to me over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you for the thousands of hugs and kisses you've given me," the mother 
said. "I'll always cherish them in my heart. Thank you for being a wonderful 
daughter and a great friend. I love you 'til infinity." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends talked of Jasmin's love for music and honored her by singing one of 
her favorite songs during the service: "Cat's in the Cradle." As they sang, 
many in the gathering began to weep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jasmin is not really dead," her mother told the mourners. "She is alive. She 
has only left her shell. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of the family have set up a memorial fund to assist the parents, both 
of whom are out of work. Contributions can be made in the name of Tyra Cook at 
Universal Savings Bank, 1249 E. Katella Ave., Orange 92667.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; REFORM LAWS CHANGING WAY CANDIDATES RUN 
CAMPAIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first significant test of Orange County's sweeping campaign reforms, 
supervisorial candidates in the hotly contested race for the 2nd District seat 
have been forced to campaign with less money than candidates in previous board 
elections, campaign finance records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Both supporters and critics of the campaign reform laws say the contribution 
limits have had a dramatic impact on the way candidates Linda Moulton Patterson 
and Jim Silva have campaigned so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters contend that the reforms have caused the candidates to focus more 
on public debates and community forums to reach voters, instead of relying on 
expensive mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how campaigns should be run," said William R. Mitchell, chairman of 
Orange County Common Cause, a political watchdog group. "I'm very pleased with 
the way the reforms are working." 
</P>
<P>
 But campaign consultants for the two 2nd District candidates say the 
contribution restrictions, which limit individual donations to $1,000 per 
candidate for every election cycle, have resulted in the candidates spending 
more time trying to raise money and less time meeting with the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing like it was last time there was a heavily contested 
supervisorial race eight years ago," said Harvey Englander, campaign manager 
for Moulton Patterson. "There was a lot more spending then. Now it's harder to 
get our message across." 
</P>
<P>
 "The price of running a campaign has gone up and the number of voters keeps 
going up with the population growth," said Dave Gilliard, who is running 
Silva's campaign. "The restrictions have definitely made it tougher to run a 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the reforms, the candidates have had to seek "free media" coverage, 
such as newspaper articles, while stockpiling cash for last-minute election 
mailers to reach the voters, the consultants said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the contribution limitation, both candidates in the bitter race have 
still been able to amass significant war chests. According to campaign 
officials, Moulton Patterson, the mayor of Huntington Beach, has raised 
$268,000 for the primary and general election races; Silva, a Huntington Beach 
councilman, has raised $260,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Those figures, however, are less than what candidates raised in 1986, the last 
time there was an open Orange County supervisorial seat. The two top candidates 
in that race spent a combined total of more than $1 million, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 In that election, then-Anaheim Mayor Don R. Roth faced off against then-Orange 
Mayor James Beam and former Rep. Jerry Patterson, who is Moulton Patterson's 
husband. A fourth candidate, Manuel Mendez, rounded out the highly competitive 
field. Spending in that race totaled more than $1.6 million. In a runoff, Roth 
-- who spent about $430,000 -- beat Beam, who spent more than $640,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither side will be able to do that this time," said Englander, who ran 
Roth's 1986 campaign. He added that the top candidates in 1986 sent out eight 
to 12 mailers in that race. To date, Silva has sent five mailers and Moulton 
Patterson three mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District includes Huntington Beach, Seal Beach, Westminster, Los 
Alamitos, Garden Grove, Stanton, Cypress, Rossmoor and Sunset Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are approximately 244,000 voters in this district," Englander said. "To 
mail one piece of mail is $18,000 and that's just the postage. With the 
printing and materials it costs $40,000 to mail something now. That's a lot of 
money. I don't think we'll be able to reach as many voters as we did eight 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We spend almost every business hour raising money today and less 
time meeting voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the campaign reforms, however, were not sympathetic to the 
complaints of the political consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really tough for both sides. So what?" said Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. 
"It's probably equal. So the campaign consultants won't be getting as much 
money as they used to. Let's hear the applause for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say that even if the candidates are spending more time trying to 
raise money, they are doing it by contacting more contributors instead of 
relying on a few wealthy special interest groups, which the backers say was a 
major reason why the reforms were needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather see them getting money from more people than having the developers 
fund the campaign," said Shirley Grindle, a political activist who helped 
author the 1992 reform laws. "That's one of the goals of the ordinance -- to 
spread things around." 
</P>
<P>
 Many developers and other special interest groups still contribute up to the 
$1,000 limit for primary races and then for the general election. Both Silva 
and Moulton Patterson report contributions from developers such as the Mission 
Viejo Co. and the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But the role of developers and special interests groups in financing campaigns 
has definitely been limited by the reform measures. As a result, Silva and 
Moulton Patterson have had to look to many sources for funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're having a heck of a time raising money. There's so much 
competition for the political dollars," said Supervisor William G. Steiner. "I 
think everybody is having a hard time. (The reforms) are making the race a much 
more grass-roots effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some lobbyists have welcomed the contribution restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives my clients a chance to spread their money around on a broader 
basis," said Frank Michelena, a top governmental consultant in the county. 
"With cities, the state and the county, it's just impossible to contribute to 
everyone. So far we've been able to live with this." 
</P>
<P>
 Grindle said the two candidates may be collecting less money for their 
campaigns because private citizens and businesses are feeling the pinch of the 
state's recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're testing the creativeness of the political consultants," Grindle said. 
"They don't have an open bankbook anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Supervisor Ralph Clark said he thinks the reform laws are healthy for 
politics and believes further measures should be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should also put a lid on how much money a person can put into 
their own campaign," he said, referring to Haydee V. Tillotson, who lent her 
own campaign for the 2nd District $342,000. Despite her financial resources, 
she lost to Silva and Moulton Patterson in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Clark said he realizes that the expense of running a campaign has 
changed over the years. "When I ran, stamps cost 5 cents and mailers were 
cheaper," he said. "Everything is on a different scale now."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
BARRED FROM RUNNING, HILL ELECTS TO FORGIVE A GOP COLLEAGUE'S DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That's what friends are for: Former state Sen. Frank Hill may be in a federal 
prison in Boron for political corruption, but he's apparently feeling generous 
lately, at least toward Assemblyman Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside). 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who lent Morrow nearly $100,000 more than two years ago, has recently 
forgiven $50,000 of that debt, Morrow acknowledged last week. Morrow had 
already paid "about $10,000" of that back, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow said Hill's forgiveness is "not surprising" and a common occurrence 
among politicians with similar agendas. He said Republican Assembly Leader Jim 
Brulte also recently forgave him a $4,000 debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who want to get the Legislature out of debt because we have 
the same goals," Morrow said. "We try and work together." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow said these debts are often passed back and forth and are usually not 
collected until someone runs for another office, which Hill is unlikely to do 
in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Frank Hill had another campaign to run for state Senate or higher office, 
he'd be looking for the money," Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Who was that guy?: Campaign dirty tricks stole the show last week when 69th 
Assembly District candidates Jim Morrissey, a Republican, and his Democratic 
opponent, Mike Metzler, got into it during a campaign debate. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems two people showed up at Metzler's Santa Ana headquarters for the 
campaign opening and stole some confidential documents. When Metzler's staff 
tracked one of them down, he confessed, asked for forgiveness and said he was 
sent by Morrissey. 
</P>
<P>
 During the debate, Metzler asked Morrissey "what kind of moral essence" the 
young people of today are being taught by pushing them into such shenanigans. A 
backpedaling Morrissey pointed the finger in another direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before you start making wild accusations at people . . . you should get your 
record straight," Morrissey said. "The gentleman you're pointing out is not one 
of my staffers. . . . It's Sen. (Rob) Hurtt's staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt, the Republican from Garden Grove, has been sharing campaign resources 
with Morrissey and Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove). He could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Anything for a buck: Even if Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) fails to 
unseat Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, he'll get an A-plus for his invitations to 
campaign fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple months ago, Umberg prompted guffaws around the Capitol with a beach 
party invitation that featured a photograph of the land-loving assemblyman 
posing in a wet suit, neon sunglasses and holding a waxed surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Umberg's bow to the Irish -- an Oct. 27 fete at Muldoon's Irish Pub 
and Restaurant in Newport Beach. To herald the event, Umberg's campaign minions 
have dispatched a green and gold-embossed card featuring a caricature of the 
lawmaker -- who is of German and Swiss descent -- as a leprechaun doing a jig 
beside a pot of gold. Inside is a verse: 
</P>
<P>
 There once was a lad with a vision,  
</P>
<P>
 To be Attorney General was his mission.  
</P>
<P>
 He'd gained lots of praise,  
</P>
<P>
 But it's money he must raise,  
</P>
<P>
 So the honor of your presence we are wishin'. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately enough, musical entertainment will be provided by the Irish 
Beggarmen Band.

 Mickey for Freedom: Assemblyman Mickey Conroy, who hit the headlines this year 
with a bill to paddle juvenile graffiti vandals and a suit filed by a former 
employee that alleged sexual harassment, has never been big on political 
correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Orange Republican heard that officials at Sacramento State 
University had banned Young Americans for Freedom from campus, Conroy angrily 
cried out for free speech and weighed in on behalf of the YAFers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is clearly an attempt to stifle the conservative movement on what has 
been historically a liberal campus," Conroy said. "Just because you disagree 
with a group's ideology doesn't mean you can throw away the First Amendment 
right of freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's staff is investigating what legal recourse is available to get the 
group accepted on campus. 
</P>
<P>

 Party shots: It's been pretty clear for some time that Republican U.S. Senate 
candidate Mike Huffington won't be getting support from one of his GOP primary 
opponents, former Orange County Rep. William E. Dannemeyer. The former 
congressman said recently that he will be voting "for the candidate who comes 
closest to affirming the principles of the Republican national platform. . . . 
It's not Huffington." Although he's still thinking about it, Dannemeyer said 
he'll probably vote for the American Independent Party candidate, Paul 
Meeuwenberg.

RETHINKING SCHOOLS: SCENES FROM THE FRONT LINE OF EDUCATION REFORM IN L.A.; 
CHARTER PUTS FENTON ON FAST TRACK TO SUCCESS; ONCE-TROUBLED LAKE VIEW TERRACE 
CAMPUS HAS BEEN REINVENTING ITSELF AND CREATIVELY SOLVING PROBLEMS SINCE 
BREAKING AWAY FROM L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Joe Lucente became principal of Fenton Avenue Elementary six years ago, 
hisboss talked for an hour about how bad things were at the San Fernando Valley 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly things got better. Vandalism, once a regular weekend occurrence, all 
but stopped. The campus became cleaner, safer, a little more orderly. But 
student achievement remained low, Lucente said, and the staff was demoralized. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a faster route to improvement, Fenton Avenue last year joined the 
fledgling charter school movement. Parents and faculty wrote the proposed 
charter in a few weeks in the spring of 1993, and all but two teachers signed 
the document that removed their campus from the sizable umbrella of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Since gaining its freedom in January, the campus below the mountains in 
working-class, heavily minority Lake View Terrace has been reinventing itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with essentially the same budget as last year -- about $4,500 per 
student -- Fenton has added an after-school enrichment program and study hall, 
keeping the campus open until after 6 p.m. each day to accommodate working 
parents and give students time for homework and supervised activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Class size was cut from 30 to 25. The school added two full-time teachers to 
give individual attention to students needing extra help, a counselor, a 
psychologist and a librarian, and it beefed up security and playground 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 These and several other steps were taken, Lucente said, to boost the academic 
chances of the school's 1,180 students, most of whom come from families poor 
enough that they quality for the federal government's free breakfast and lunch 
program. Nearly 60% speak little English, turnover is high, and many pupils 
score well below state and district averages on basic academic skills tests. 
</P>
<P>
 To help draw parents into the school's activities, Fenton started a family 
center at the school in which parents, both paid and volunteer, learn English, 
operate a food bank and perform work on the campus. Recently, parents were 
hired to secure shelves and bolt supply cabinets to make classrooms safer in an 
earthquake. There are Saturday workshops for parents and students and more 
English classes for adults in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fenton still contracts with the school district for some services, 
the freedom of its charter status lets school officials act creatively to meet 
most of their needs. Textbooks can be ordered faster from suppliers, and when 
the preschool wanted a new sandbox, a local carpenter was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we have an idea, something that we as a school community want to do, we 
can just go ahead and implement it," said Irene Sumida, Fenton's director of 
curriculum. "We can pick and choose among the best, whether it's something the 
district does very well -- such as its bilingual education program -- or 
something our staff has created just for our students." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucente, who changed his title to executive director, shares day-to-day 
responsibility for running the school with Sumida, who earns the same salary. 
She is responsible for the academic programs, he for business operations. Seven 
so-called working councils of staff, parents and community members set 
policies, with a 15-member umbrella group to assist with communications and 
help resolve disagreements in the working groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the charter, plant manager James Parker said, he often "felt like an 
outsider. . . . Now I have a vote on everything, and I feel like part of a 
team. I've seen us go from bickering to all getting along and getting things 
done for the school." 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, Parker added, are the changes he sees on campus. "It's easier 
to keep clean now, it feels more tranquil, and the kids seem excited about 
being here," said Parker, who has added after-school basketball coaching to his 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers, who gave up their union contract and many of its protections to stay 
at Fenton, said they are working a lot harder now but enjoying it more. 
Recently, teachers redesigned the school's report card, with the help of 
parents, to make it more meaningful and understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children know that we mean business, that we are serious and committed," 
said teacher Janelle Berz. "It's an incredible place. I would never go back" to 
a traditional district school, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Fenton students, who attend school year-round on one of three 
staggered tracks to relieve overcrowding, the most striking change is in the 
school breakfast and lunch program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lunchtime used to be chaotic, sometimes even humiliating, according to pupils 
and staff members. Students waited in a single slow-moving line for their food. 
Those who qualified for federally subsidized lunches had to turn in meal 
tickets, a cumbersome process that stigmatized poorer pupils. The eating area 
was noisy, with students shouting, running around, sometimes throwing food and 
causing other mischief. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, meals are served free to everyone and tabulated with bar-coded cards kept 
at the end of the service lines. There is a choice of three entrees, and 
students are funneled by aides into lines according to their selections, so 
there is less waiting. Classical music is piped into the eating area, fostering 
a soothing, orderly atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like having the cards and the choices," said sixth-grader Branden Newsome, 
11. "It's way quieter now, way cleaner and there's not much fighting anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Claudia Lopez, also 11, said she likes the changes in the cafeteria. 
But they are not what she likes most about Fenton Avenue. "The teachers are 
very nice. They want you to learn, and they help you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charters are not for everyone, Lucente cautions, but the payoff can be 
monumental. 
</P>
<P>
 "The charter frees us to be the best that we can be," Lucente said. "As the 
years pass, we'll see marked differences in our students' achievement. There is 
no doubt in my mind about that." Charter Schools 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide charter movement was admitted to California public schools by a 
1992 law allowing up to 100 campuses to apply for freedom from many regulations 
and policies. With the autonomy of a state charter, schools may fashion their 
own educational styles and programs. Schools must file a detailed plan for 
improving education, obtain permission from at least 50% of teachers and the 
local and state school boards, be non-sectarian and tuition-free, and achieve a 
racial and ethnic balance that mirrors the district population. Charters are 
granted for five years. Los Angeles-Area Charters

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; SURVEY SEEKS TO RALLY SUPPORT FOR LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RODNEY BOSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Ventura County's public libraries reeling from budget woes, volunteers on 
Saturday took the message to the people in the form of a survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Girl Scouts and other volunteers staffed survey tables at nearly a dozen 
locations around Ventura, including supermarkets, shopping centers, a gardening 
nursery and the farmers' market. 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal: to raise public awareness and show residents how they can take a 
proactive approach to preserve library services. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey asked residents if they would support a tax assessment, seeking 
additional government funding to extend library hours, a replacement for Foster 
Library, and if they would be willing to approach politicians for more 
financial assistance. Residents were also given the chance to donate money on 
the spot. Donations will be used for extended hours at four Ventura libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the survey sprang from the community-minded efforts of Pat 
Barrett of Ventura. Wanting somehow to participate in Saturday's national 
community service "Make a Difference Day," Barrett mulled over several 
volunteer options and chose to focus on the county's beleaguered library 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided the biggest difference I could make would be helping the libraries 
remain open for more hours," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Barrett pondered spearheading a fund-raiser campaign. That notion 
quickly evolved after discussing her idea with library officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fund raising is helpful," said Trish Cavanaugh, community relations manager 
of the county Library Services Agency, "but it's a Band-Aid. In the long run we 
need stable funding." 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of a fund-raiser, Barrett and Cavanaugh decided to wage a public 
awareness campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to motivate people. Let them know there is a problem and that they 
can do something about it," Barrett said, while recruiting participants for the 
survey at the Barnes & Noble bookstore on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Survey results will be completed in about two weeks, Cavanaugh said. The 
results will then be handed over to local government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our libraries are to survive," Cavanaugh said, "people will have to 
support it themselves. This survey will give the people a voice." RODNEY BOSCH

CAMPAIGN '94: ISSUES AND ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 73rd 
Assembly District. They are Democrat Lee Walker of Laguna Niguel; Republican 
Bill Morrow, the incumbent, of Oceanside; Libertarian B. Wade Hostler of 
Oceanside; and Peace & Freedom candidate Tonatiuh Rodriguez-Nikl of Carlsbad. 
Here's how they stand on four issues. "Three Strikes" Crime Law 
</P>
<P>
 Walker: " 'Three strikes' is a complicated piece of legislation that is 
confusing and difficult to interpret. The Department of Corrections estimated 
21 new prisons would be required because of 'three strikes,' at a cost of over 
$22 billion and $5.7 billion to operate each year. A more reasonable approach 
is the 'one strike, you're out' bill sponsored by (state Sen.) Marian Bergeson. 
This bill mandates 25-years-to-life terms for violent rapists and child 
molesters. This bill is tough on crime at the first level and would 
dramatically deter those who are contemplating first-time assaults." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow: "I am a co-author and strongly support the 'three strikes' 
legislation. Such a law will cause people inclined to criminal behavior to 
think twice about committing a crime when they are assured that commission of a 
third felony will land them in prison for life. When repeat offenders are 
jailed for good, the public will be protected from their predation and can rest 
assured they will not be loosed upon society again. However, a better 
alternative to a 'three strikes' provision is a 'one' or 'two-strikes' law." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostler: "I strongly support a limited form of 'three strikes,' one which 
exclusively targets violent criminals. I am pleased by the recent passage of 
the 'one-strike' law which targets violent rapists and sex offenders. I also 
support 'truth-in-sentencing' legislation which will force violent offenders to 
serve at least 80% of their sentences. When multiple rapists are released after 
serving only 12 1/2 years of their 25-year sentences, it is an affront to the 
victims and their families." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez-Nikl: "I oppose the 'three-strikes' law. It violates the freedom 
judges must have to ensure that the punishment is proportional to the crime. 
Violent crime is actually down. Crime hysteria is up and the 'three strikes' 
law feeds that hysteria. It is not a coincidence that the U.S.A. is the country 
of the world with the highest percentage of citizens being imprisoned and the 
lowest academic test scores of any industrialized country. The 'three strikes' 
law would result in filling up prisons while draining billions of dollars that 
can be used for social programs. I favor lighter sentences and more money for 
education. Initiative to Curtail Benefits to Illegal Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Walker: "I oppose this initiative. The 15th Amendment provides that any person 
born in the U.S. is an American citizen. Those immigrants now in the U.S. 
should be provided with benefits, education and medical attention. However, new 
immigration from Mexico needs to be controlled. The United States should 
negotiate with the president of Mexico to limit the amount of money that 
immigrants send back to Mexico. The money is a significant part of the Mexican 
economy, and Mexico wants the funds. In addition, the U.S. should place 
stricter regulation on businesses hiring immigrants. Until these two policies 
change, no fence, no high walls or border patrol can halt the migration." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow: "I strongly support the 'Save Our State' initiative. Illegal 
immigration costs California nearly $5 billion a year. Taxpayers simply should 
not be required to pay for public health, social and education services to 
persons illegally present in our country. Our limited tax dollars dwindle fast 
in the present economic recession and budget crisis. It doesn't make sense to 
provide public services to illegal aliens when such services are already 
insufficiently provided to our own citizens in California. The initiative 
forces California government to prioritize its spending in favor of 
Californians." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostler: "It saddens me to oppose any measure which seeks to limit benefits to 
illegal aliens, but I must oppose Proposition 187. The reporting provisions of 
Prop. 187 are expensive and unworkable. The initiative also claims to target 
only illegal aliens, but would in fact hurt citizen children whose parents are 
illegal aliens. Under Prop. 187, schoolchildren must have proof not only of 
their legal residency, but of their parents as well. Most people believe 
citizen children have a right to a public education. This provision would deny 
them that right." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez-Nikl: "All immigrants, including undocumented workers, provide 
benefits to the economy by doing work that Americans are unwilling or unable to 
do. American families cannot survive by picking the food that we put on our 
tables. Our economy needs immigrant labor and Americans need immigrant 
services. That's why they're hired. Californians need to know that people 
immigrate to other places when their way of living is destroyed by big 
corporations, and farmers are then forced to look for a way to feed their 
families." Single-Payer Health Initiative 
</P>
<P>
 Walker: "I support this initiative. This plan would reduce the amount 
businesses would contribute to health plans, it would provide more health care 
for children, and would guarantee that every working family would have health 
coverage, including part-time employees. It would save millions of dollars in 
paperwork and would provide more accountability in assessment of fees." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow: "The 'single-payer' health plan initiative would be disastrous to 
California. The 'single-payer' means the government. Which means the taxpayer! 
The plan calls for the largest state tax increase in U.S. history. The state 
budget would go from its current $40 billion general fund to over $83 billion 
-- overnight. Instead, we need to pass consumer-based health care reform that 
does not put government bureaucrats in charge, as this initiative proposes to 
do. We need real reform that gives individuals and families more power and 
freedom to make their own medical decisions. More of our tax dollars should be 
returned to us rather than wasted on radical social experimentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostler: "Government should stay out of the health-care business. The examples 
of Medi-Cal and Medicare have amply demonstrated the inability of government to 
control health-care costs. Instead, the government should apply free-market 
incentives to the health-care system. For instance, health insurance costs 
should be a tax-deductible expense for those who are self-insured rather than 
through an employer." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez-Nikl: "I favor the single-payer health plan. Single-payer will save 
billions of dollars that under the present system are wasted by allowing 
insurance companies to run an inefficient system that requires an enormous 
amount of administrative bureaucracy. I favor full universal coverage for all 
with an emphasis on preventive health care. I believe that if all other 
industrialized countries of the world can provide health care for all their 
citizens, the U.S.A. must do the same for it's citizens." Future Uses For El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Walker: "I oppose a cargo or commercial passenger airport at El Toro. The 
impact on Laguna Niguel, Dana Point, Leisure World, San Clemente, and Mission 
Viejo would have extremely high sound blasts on these areas. The jet noise 
would interfere with the learning environment in all the schools in these 
areas. A Reuse Authority is meeting regularly to plan uses for the base. I 
favor commercial building, housing, education facilities, museums, parks, and a 
new university." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow: "El Toro Marine Corps Air Station is vital to our national defense, 
and the Marines should stay there! However, so long as the Clinton 
Administration persists in its perilous path to close the base, the El Toro 
Reuse Planning Authority should thoroughly study every reuse alternative. It 
should recommend the option that is best suited and will enhance the economic 
well-being and quality of life in the community. Pending the study and findings 
of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, which may persuade me otherwise, I'm 
not convinced that a commercial airport is the best option." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostler: "I think it is inappropriate to take a position until the federal 
government decides on how to dispose of the property. I can say that I would 
vote no on the ballot initiative on the grounds that there may be better uses 
of the property than an airport. An immediate commitment to build a commercial 
airport is premature. We should wait and see how things work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez-Nikl: "I oppose the development of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
This facility was paid with tax dollars that all Americans paid, and it would 
be unfair to continue subsidizing big business. If the airlines want another 
airport, let them build one with their own money. The facility should be 
converted to a park and recreation area for public use."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN WHO DIED FLEEING POLICE IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities Saturday said they have identified a Ventura man who died after he 
ran from police into the ocean and drowned near the Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were seeking the public's help in finding relatives of Stephen Richard 
Webb, 36, whose body was recovered Thursday afternoon, several hours after a 
pre-dawn foot chase near the Ventura Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Stevens, senior deputy coroner, said authorities were able to identify 
Webb with the help of workers at Project Understanding. Police said Webb was 
homeless and occasionally sought help at the social services agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb was white, with brown hair and a reddish mustache, weighed 150 to 160 
pounds and was 5 feet, 9 inches tall, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to authorities, Webb died early Thursday after a Ventura police 
officer, suspecting Webb to be a prowler, chased him from the parking structure 
of the Country Inn on South Chestnut Street in Ventura to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb was a suspect in a burglary at a Ventura apartment complex that occurred 
about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday, police said. At 3:12 a.m. Thursday, a prowler was 
reported in the parking structure of the hotel, situated across the street from 
the inn. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the prowler call, police tried to talk to the man but he darted 
across the California Street overpass and ran toward the ocean, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a daylong search that involved a Coast Guard helicopter and two law 
enforcement vessels, a group of divers found Webb's body near the Ventura Pier 
on Thursday afternoon, police said. 
</P>

 On Saturday, authorities said the body recovered closely resembles the 
description of the prowler given by officers and the burglary victim.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAMARILLO; 2 MASKED MEN ROB FEDERAL CREDIT UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two masked men, including one whose blue bandanna kept slipping off his face, 
robbed a federal credit union in Camarillo after stealing a getaway car in 
Sherman Oaks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A blue 1977 Buick was found nearby, its engine still running, after the men 
held up Point Mugu Federal Credit Union at gunpoint at 11:25 a.m. Thursday, FBI 
Special Agent Larry Dick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a large-caliber handgun, one man ordered the dozen customers and 
employees to drop to the floor while he leaped over the counter to rifle the 
tellers' cash drawers, Ventura County Sheriff's Detective Dan Place said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men wore a ski mask and the other a blue bandanna that didn't stay 
in place, Dick said. "He would pull it up into place, and then it would slide 
down again. He kept fidgeting with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the blue bandanna and the fact the car was stolen in Sherman Oaks, 
investigators suspect that the bandits belong to a Los Angeles-area street 
gang, Dick said. He said they probably abandoned the stolen car, which had been 
taken sometime the night before, and escaped in another. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit union on East Daily Drive was the 18th financial institution robbed 
this year in Ventura County, compared to 42 by this time last year, Dick said.

NEW MEDIUM FOR REV. SCHULLER'S MESSAGE; RELIGION: THE CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL 
MINISTER'S 'HOUR OF POWER' FILM WILL SCREEN IN THEATERS TO HELP OFFSET 
CANCELLATION OF TV PROGRAM IN RUSSIA AND EUROPE. 
</P>

<P>
 As they entered the theater at MainPlace/Santa Ana, passing the popcorn stand 
and posters of upcoming attractions, Wilfred and Clara Landrus were reminded 
that the leading man they came to see Saturday morning was the same one who 
appeared at a drive-in theater they first went to in Orange almost 40 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilfred Landrus, 76, recalled that one Sunday in 1955, their 4-year-old son 
had mumps and couldn't be taken inside a church. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we decided to go to that crazy drive-in church in Orange," Landrus said, 
where the Rev. Robert H. Schuller was preaching from a pulpit atop a snack bar 
to a parking lot full of cars outfitted with speakers attached to their 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday morning, the Landruses were among about 125 members of Schuller's 
congregation -- now based at the enormous Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove -- 
who showed up for a preview of a film that was a composite of edited segments 
of Schuller's "Hour of Power" television ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 The same film will premiere in Australia at 4 p.m. today, as Schuller, a 
leading proponent of Christian positive thinking, launches a new program to 
distribute "Hour of Power" films worldwide. His goal is to have screenings in 
2,000 theaters within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller has turned to film as an alternative to spread his message to those 
he calls "the unchurched" after his weekly television show earlier this year 
lost 10 million to 15 million viewers when it was taken off the 
government-owned station in Russia. The television ministry had lost another 
200,000 viewers when "Hour of Power" was dropped in January by Europe's Super 
Channel network. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller, who brought his international board of directors to Saturday's 
viewing, also expressed a sense of deja vu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't made much progress, have I?" he joked in memory of the church's 
drive-in beginning. "But at least we have a roof over our heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the movie program was born out of adversity, Schuller said he is so 
impressed by the effectiveness of the concept that he intends to continue 
showing films of Sunday services in movie houses even if he recoups the loss in 
TV viewers. "It is far more impacting than a television program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller and Ray Cotton, another longtime minister who is directing the 
venture called "The Hour of Power in Cinema," said they hope the movies will 
attract people who are intimidated by traditional churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of non-church people are hesitant or fearful of going to a church. But 
they've all been to movie theaters," Cotton said. "It is their turf and takes 
away some of the stigmas and unknowns." 
</P>
<P>
 He said 20 theaters scattered throughout the United States will begin regular 
Sunday morning showings on Nov. 6 of the "Hour of Power" films, including 
Edwards Newport Cinema in Newport Beach and another theater in Westminster yet 
to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, under an agreement with Edwards Cinemas, all Edwards theaters in 
Southern California will participate, according to Schuller spokesman Michael 
Nason. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton said refreshments will be offered at many of the showings and members 
of local churches will serve as hosts to greet those who attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike regular church services and "Hour of Power" television programs, there 
will be no calls for offerings at the theaters, Cotton said. Although going to 
the movies is less convenient than watching a television sermon at home, the 
atmosphere at the theaters will be less formal than at church, he said, with 
people welcome to come dressed casually or in "mall attire," rather than their 
Sunday best. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the film rolled Saturday, Schuller, reading an announcement that will 
introduce the show to newcomers, urged those attending the preview to 
participate as if they were an extension of the congregation shown on the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Some adjustment was required for regular churchgoers. Those who entered after 
the film had begun nervously whispered to one another that they were blinded by 
the darkness and carefully sought out empty seats. And only a brave minority, 
including Schuller, sang and applauded in concert with the choirs and audiences 
on film. 
</P>
<P>
 But afterward, everyone seemed satisfied that the new movie had hit potential. 
"The photography was just great," one woman gushed when Cotton asked for 
reactions from the audience. Another suggested that "The Glory of Christmas" 
and "Glory of Easter," two popular holiday productions at Crystal Cathedral, 
could make a "double feature." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Swann, who for 13 years has played the huge organ at Crystal Cathedral, 
said Dolby stereo made the music much more satisfactory than the sound produced 
by a small television speaker. "It is more comparable to being at Crystal 
Cathedral," he said.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO CITY COUNCIL; BALANCING BUSINESS AND 
ENVIRONMENT IS PRIMARY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Running for City Council here is fairly uncomplicated: Pledge to protect 
ridgelines, trees and the rustic charm of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 But priorities on a handful of other issues are what separate the nine 
candidates vying for three seats on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters on Nov. 8 will choose from among a field of more established city 
players, including incumbent Councilman Gil Jones, and newcomers to the 
political scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Jones, 62, the owner of the Jones Family Mini Farm, the list of 
candidates includes Serge Kohan, 45, an import-export entrepreneur; Philipe 
Delgado Jr., 43, a business owner and consultant; John Greiner, 56, a human 
resources executive and Planning Commission chairman; Wyatt Hart, 58, a retired 
sheriff's captain and Planning Commission member; Mario Pina, 39, a postal 
carrier; David Swerdlin, 51, a photographer; Steven Dallas, 43, a radiation 
therapist; and Carlos Negrete, 37, an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Some candidates are spending no money on the race, relying on word of mouth or 
neighborhood canvassing to reach voters. 
</P>
<P>
 One candidate -- Hart -- has received financial support from families whose 
bloodlines run deep here in one of California's oldest cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates say they want to lure new tax dollars into the city without 
detracting from its unique character. 
</P>
<P>
 Many also say they want to try to fight impacts from the outside, such as a 
county proposal to pile trash in the Prima Deshecha Landfill 80 feet above a 
ridgeline, or a countywide ballot initiative that calls for converting El Toro 
Marine Air Corps Station into a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 On the dollar side, city officials for years have talked about turning six 
acres downtown into a centerpiece development, the Historic Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But the land has remained a weed-choked lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he is seeking a second term in part because he wants to implement a 
downtown plan. The city has recently unveiled five conceptual projects, ranging 
from a 28-room inn and 4,500 square feet of retail space to a 92-room inn and 
26,000 square feet of retail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get everything done that I wanted," Jones said. "It's not that I 
didn't try. One person can't dictate policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, who as of Sept. 30, had raised more than twice as much money as any 
other candidate, said his No. 1 concern is crime.  
</P>
<P>
 "San Juan Capistrano is not as bad as some of its sister cities, but for the 
people of San Juan, it's too much," Hart said of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said he also wants to better market the city as a destination place, 
which in turn would generate more retail dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Greiner said the city needs to land a medium-size company that would help 
provide local jobs and merchandise for residents who must now drive to Mission 
Viejo or farther north to shop for certain retail goods. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city should also help prospective businesses by taking a closer 
look at projects earlier in the permit process rather than kill them after the 
applicant has spent several thousand dollars on design work and fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado, whose father founded Phil and Jim's, a chain of appliance stores, 
agrees that the city needs a more business-friendly attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have anybody who goes out and meets person-to-person with 
businesses," Delgado said. "We've got enough empty retail space to choke a 
horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Pina said the city shouldn't dither anymore on a reasonable scale of downtown 
redevelopment. Too many businesses stand to lose, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Greiner, Kohan said he believes the city should court businesses that 
could serve as anchor tenants, provide jobs and bring more visitors to San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Swerdlin, president of Friends of Historic San Juan, said the city must be 
diligent about protecting itself from urban growth surrounding it. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he also favors a "low- to moderate-density" development of the 
Historic Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of a commercial airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, has Dallas concerned, as well as the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that airport goes in, our lifestyle is going to change dramatically," 
Dallas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Negrete has been the most combative of the candidates, saying early in the 
campaign that he would best represent residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Negrete contends that an "old-guard network" of politicians has controlled 
city policy long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need a hotel downtown," Negrete said. "That's going to be a white 
elephant. Historic Town Center means the good old boys want to have a party." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer and first-term Councilman Jeff Vasquez 
will not seek reelection.

RETHINKING SCHOOLS: SCENES FROM THE FRONT LINE OF EDUCATION REFORM IN L.A.; 
LEARN FREEDOM UNLEASHES EXCITEMENT AT ROSCOE ELEMENTARY; EMPOWERED BY THE 
REFORM PROGRAM'S EMPHASIS ON LOCAL CONTROL, PARENTS, STAFF AND STUDENTS CREATE 
A STIMULATING AND POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT AT THE SUN VALLEY CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Roscoe Elementary School is a work in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Desks, chairs and tables line the hallways as workers refurbish a front office 
damaged in an arson fire more than 2 1/2 years ago. Half the library remains 
closed off behind thick plastic sheeting as the school prepares to open a media 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and administrators proudly show off the unfinished rooms -- the dust, 
the workers and the noise -- as proof that the school is making a move. From 
the offices and the library to the classrooms, the Sun Valley campus buzzes 
with activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see this kind of excitement in magnet schools, in some private schools 
and some schools in more affluent areas," said Ruth Bunyan, the principal at 
Roscoe. "It's rare to see this kind of excitement in a school like this. But 
we're a LEARN school." 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN, the acronym for the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring 
Now, is a reform program designed to raise student achievement by giving 
schools more local control. 
</P>
<P>
 Releasing the constraints has unleashed Roscoe. Eager parents took over an 
abandoned building and created a parents' center; teachers have adopted new 
lesson plans and redesigned report cards; administrators make fewer solo 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen classrooms have new carpets. Offices left with blackened walls and 
plywood door patches from the arson fire in March, 1992, finally are being 
refurbished. A new security system is being installed to prevent the weekend 
break-ins that had all but wiped out the school's computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Roscoe had an active staff long before the LEARN program was launched there 
last year. But the program has given the Roscoe team the ability to shed the 
shackles of district rules and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, they would entrust you with the minds and lives of 30 young children 
but never give you a set of keys," said Susan Gilliam, who teaches kindergarten 
students and first- and second-graders. "We have a lot more control now over 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the old days teachers were a victim of the system. My God, don't 
touch the holy system." 
</P>
<P>
 The system is all new in Kim Deal's classroom. A signboard outside the 
classroom bungalow reads: "Something Is Fishy." 
</P>
<P>
 Deal's fifth- and sixth-graders, most of whom speak Spanish in class, have 
transformed the classroom into a marine world. A huge paper whale hangs from 
the ceiling. Brightly colored murals depicting ocean scenes line the walls, 
along with short essays in Spanish. The room even smells like the sea (thanks 
to an air freshener). 
</P>
<P>
 The theme fits a method of teaching known as the "Scottish story line" in 
which students learn most academic subjects by creating a story and following 
plots, characters and settings. Teachers select the theme and help steer the 
story using science, social studies and English, but students create the 
characters and develop the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saturate them with whatever topic you're doing," Deal said. "I want every 
sense to be involved. I want every subject covered. I want this in their brains 
24 hours a day -- and it is." 
</P>
<P>
 In another room, Susan Stealey's fifth- and sixth-graders were just beginning 
a story line on plantation life after the Civil War. As some students painted 
on butcher paper, others drew wells, a slave house and several characters. A 
small group of students sat at the front of the classroom reading a chapter on 
slavery in their social studies textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The room bustled with activity. The students appeared engaged and interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "This brings in all the kids -- even those who might not be real interested in 
school," Stealey said. "And we're doing the work when it's best for us. 
Nobody's telling us to teach reading and then math and then social studies. 
We're not cutting them off when they're just getting interested to switch to 
another subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Roscoe teachers said they were drawn to the story line concept after they 
agreed to organize classrooms with different age groups -- rather than grade 
levels. Looking for a way to engage students at varying educational levels, the 
teachers discovered the method at a LEARN workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's 1,050 students typically score well below state and district 
averages on standardized tests. Although Bunyan said she is trying to protect 
the teachers from worrying about test scores, she said she anticipates 
measurable results eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 No studies have been completed to determine whether students taught in the 
Scottish story line method do in fact improve, but officials familiar with the 
program say they expect test scores to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really expect to see significant improvement in test scores," said Jeff 
Nelson, a visiting professor at UCLA who conducts training workshops for the 87 
Los Angeles schools participating in the LEARN program. "It's a graphic, 
artistic representation of content-based curriculum. It draws on prior 
knowledge, and it involves a significant amount of writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Students and their parents know something unusual is happening on this campus, 
which sits between the mountains on one side and Burbank Airport on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't do the same things you used to do," said Gary Figueroa, a 
10-year-old pupil. "You learn differently and you do things differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Beatriz Gutierrez, whose children went to Roscoe and who now serves as the 
community liaison for the school, said many parents now believe they belong at 
the school. "They feel more accepted," Gutierrez said. "Before, when we had an 
idea, we were told, 'No, you can't do that, there are rules and laws against 
that.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're all working together," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is planning to offer English and other classes in the parent 
center. Some parents recently spearheaded a move to encourage students to wear 
uniforms; parents voted in favor of the voluntary uniform policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pre-LEARN, I would have called the uniform committees myself, looked into the 
idea, the costs and printed the ballots," said Bunyan, the principal. "With 
LEARN, I said, 'Great idea, go for it.' They (the parents) took charge of it. 
Now, that's a real partner." 
</P>
<P>
 The teaching staff is mostly young, spirited and unafraid to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when I get a little frustrated, I know this is so much better than we 
had before," said teacher Toni Flood. "It's enough to want to make me stay in 
Los Angeles just to see what happens here." LEARN Schools 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN, Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now, is a reform 
program in effect at 87 campuses in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
Designed by an outside group of civic, business and education leaders, it is 
destined for use in all district schools. It is not a way of teaching, but a 
new style of organizing and managing a school that gives principals more 
authority to craft the educational program. Collaboration with teachers, other 
staff and parents is required and innovation encouraged. Scottish Story Line 
</P>
<P>
 The Scottish story line approach originated 25 years ago with Glasgow teachers 
looking for ways to keep teen-agers from dropping out. It has been adopted at 
schools in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, although education 
officials say its effectiveness has yet to be measured in the United States. 
The Scottish story line is one of several new teaching methods available to 
LEARN schools.

RETHINKING SCHOOLS: SCENES FROM THE FRONT LINE OF EDUCATION REFORM IN L.A.; 
MULTI-AGE, MULTI-GRADE CLASSROOMS IMPROVE PERFORMANCE, SELF-ESTEEM; ELIZABETH 
STREET CENTER EMPHASIZES GROUP COOPERATION, NOT COMPETITION, IN YOUNGER GRADES. 
ADVANCED STUDENTS SERVE AS ROLE MODELS FOR OTHERS.

<P>
 The little ones crowded onto the carpet around their teacher, reading aloud in 
unison from a poster-sized book. "Vrrooom! . . . Vrroooom goes the bus!' they 
screeched and giggled while reading about the travails of a yellow school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every child is actually reading. Some are not talking at all and are 
simply engaged by the pictures and story. Others are fixated on trying to 
carefully pronounce new words. 
</P>
<P>
 The breadth of reading abilities in Room 401 is part of a carefully planned 
experiment in "multi-age teaching" at Elizabeth Street Learning Center in 
Cudahy. This classroom has children from kindergarten through second grade, 
ages 5 through 8. By design, not all can read or even write every letter of the 
alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see such a difference in the interaction between children," said 
teacher Monica Ibarra, who until a year ago taught a traditional kindergarten 
class. "There is less competition, more feeling of family. The children seem to 
care more about each other. I think when they are different ages, the classroom 
imitates more of their family life, where there are siblings and friends of all 
ages." 
</P>
<P>
 As a way to give students and teachers more flexibility, multi-age and 
multi-grade classrooms are fast becoming a cornerstone of instructional reform, 
education experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice is particularly being embraced in the early years of elementary 
school, when children's developmental skills run a gamut of levels. Rather than 
being limited to kindergarten or first-grade materials, learners in a multi-age 
classroom can progress at their own speed. 
</P>
<P>
 And the highest achievers become little teachers to the others, allowing for 
sharpened academic skills and a blossoming of self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Street Learning Center, one of nine national model schools for the 
New American Schools Development Corp., has transformed its traditional 
single-grade classrooms into bustling workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 The school serves 2,600 children, from pre-kindergarten to 10th grade. About 
half speak primarily Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibarra's kindergarten through second-grade class is a textbook example of how 
a multi-age classroom should look. 
</P>
<P>
 The room is divided into clusters of learning stations -- a mini-library for 
reading, a writing table stocked with pencils and paper, a building-block and 
puzzle area, a computer table. Ibarra is currently teaching her children about 
farms and food and has brought in play kitchen appliances. Another corner is 
equipped with toy animals so children can build their own farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a setup like this, it's easier to do more things and help more children," 
she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the students help each other. In one section, 7-year-old 
Jasmine Enriquez presides over a puzzle-assembling session with two 
kindergarten boys who select an array of pieces for Jasmine to lock into place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The older children act as models for the younger ones," Ibarra said. "Unlike 
most teachers, I don't have to spend a lot of valuable time refereeing the 
kids. I think they are learning to solve their problems together, with the 
younger ones going to the older ones for guidance." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to writing, for instance, Ibarra groups children not by grade or 
age, but by ability. So an 8-year-old who has never attended school before can 
work with other "pre-writers" rather than be stuck in a second-grade classroom 
where he would be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest achievers, whether age 6 or 8, can receive the specialized 
attention they need to continue their progress. Ibarra will keep the same 
students for three years, allowing her to continually evaluate their 
achievement.  
</P>
<P>
 In practice, teachers say, keeping up with this new reform movement can be 
daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the upper grades, some teachers at Elizabeth are finding the multi-age 
concept difficult to implement. In a fourth- and fifth-grade combination class, 
for instance, teacher Kay Botts says it is a challenge to find ways to meet the 
demands of specific California curriculum requirements, especially in social 
studies and history. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-graders must learn about California history, and fifth-graders must be 
taught about Native Americans and the westward movement. Botts said she tries 
to find themes that can be applied to both topics, such as explorers in both 
California and the West. She is especially concerned that the higher achievers 
in her class are at times frustrated with the pace, and she finds it difficult 
to come up with extra activities for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if this is going to work or not," Botts said. "I would hate to 
use these kids as an experiment and say later, 'Sorry kids, this didn't work 
and you missed out on a couple of years of education.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One grouping of fourth- and fifth-graders, however, gives high marks to their 
new classroom scene and said they have a newfound respect for their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get to know grown-up kids and we get used to being around little kids," 
said Daisey Macias, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smaller kids get used to talking to older kids. And when they are reading and 
get stuck, they come to us for help, so we have to learn how to talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Carlos Garcia, 10, who is now a big fifth-grader: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of us as all one class," he said. "We all play together during recess 
as one team. And all the things I learned last year I have to remember so that 
I can teach the little kids. When you are teaching them, it's not like you can 
get mad at them either, because they respect us." 
</P>

 Elizabeth Street Learning Center is part of a model project for the New 
American Schools Development Corp., a private, nonprofit organization funded by 
business leaders during the George Bush Administration. The goal here is to 
create a kindergarten-through-12th grade community to meet the needs of a 
diverse, multilingual, at-risk student population. More than 150 Los Angeles 
educators, business executives, community leaders and parent advisers have been 
involved in starting the project at Elizabeth and at Foshay Middle School in 
South-Central Los Angeles.

FIRST CAME THE REPAIRS; BLUEPRINTS HELP VICTIM LOOK FORWARD TO REPLICATING HOME 
IN SAFER MATERIAL 
</P>

<P>
 A year after losing his house to the Green Meadow fire, Harman Rasnow finally 
has a few tangible representations of what the rebuilt version will be like. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a thick roll of blueprints showing his family's future home from every 
angle. He has his zoning clearance and septic system permit. Out on the patio 
of his daughter Tina's house is a big chunk of the highly fire retardant 
material he is thinking of building with. 
</P>
<P>
 And he and his wife Eleanor have peered down into a dollhouse-like model of 
the home, recognizing rooms and windows and doors they last saw on the 
afternoon of Oct. 26, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not seem like much, but to Rasnow, 73, it is sweet progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are moving about as well as can be expected," he said, standing on the 
leveled-off lot where his house used to be. "It'll happen. There is no point in 
pushing." 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, Harman Rasnow and his family were the envy of their Newbury 
Park neighbors. For 23 years, they had the kind of house few people in 
carefully zoned Ventura County have, perched at the top of a long, high ridge 
on 200 acres hanging over the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 From their home -- elevation 1,600 feet -- they had ocean views, mountain 
views, valley views, city views, even freeway views if they cared to check on 
the pace of civilization below. They called the place U4EA. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Green Meadow fire. It began in a corner of the Los Robles Golf 
Course and ate its way through the thick chaparral up the hill toward Rasnow's 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 He watched, he called the fire department, he watched some more, he called the 
fire department again. But within a matter of hours, as firefighters 
concentrated on keeping the blaze away from clusters of Newbury Park homes, the 
blaze advanced and turned. 
</P>
<P>
 It quickly enveloped the house, making the Rasnow family the first victims of 
the wildfires that raged through Southern California last fall. The Green 
Meadow fire continued on, far past Rasnow's house, burning 38,152 acres in its 
path through the Santa Monica Mountains to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rasnow has a whole videotape full of television footage shot from helicopters 
of his house burning. But he has only watched it once, preferring instead to 
focus on the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need to dwell on it," he said, looking down the still-singed 
slope below the home site. "It's no fun, and it doesn't do me any good." 
</P>
<P>
 The last year has been hard in many ways. But the hardest thing, Rasnow said, 
was putting his wife's 102-year-old mother -- whom they had rushed down the 
hill right before the fire hit the house -- into a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife had moved into a condominium they own in Ventura. Coping with 
the fire's aftermath involved many trips back and forth between Newbury Park 
and Ventura, and the couple could not give her the constant care she needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was agonizing," Rasnow said, "because she had lived with us for more 
than 40 years. She kept asking about the house. 'I want to see where the house 
was,' she'd say. Finally we drove her out here. She looked at if for quite 
awhile without saying anything. Then she said, 'Now you can take me home.' " 
</P>
<P>
 About a month ago, the family was reunited. Their daughter Tina's new house -- 
under construction at the time of the fire, it escaped burning when winds 
shifted and pushed the fire over the ridge toward Hidden Valley -- was 
finished. Now his wife's mother -- Helene Herz -- lives there. The Rasnows 
divide their time between Tina's house and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all together again," Rasnow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family lost many treasured heirlooms in last year's fire, including 
200-year-old Austrian china, a black walnut bedroom set, Eleanor Rasnow's 
collection of music boxes, and portraits of Herz's Austrian mother and other 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, you can always get all new things," she said. "But the new 
doesn't always come up to par. A lot of the things that you want to replace are 
not made anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Included in that list is the unique Rasnow home itself. Designed by Harman 
Rasnow, it was built in sections at an Oxnard mobile home factory in the 1960s. 
The completed sections were then dragged up the steep hill on Ventu Park Road 
and linked together, forming a ring around the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The factory is gone, so he is turning to conventional builders, but not to 
conventional materials. He wants this house to be more fireproof, and he thinks 
he may have found the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here it is," he said, hefting a block of something -- it looked like concrete 
-- off Tina's patio and into the air. "See how light it is?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is a product from an Arizona-based company called Ener-Grid, formerly known 
as Rastra. A combination of recycled styrofoam, cement and some mystery 
ingredients fitted around steel supports, it is one of the most fire-resistant 
building materials available, according to Ener-Grid President Stanley John. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, he described a test of Ener-Grid where 1,920-degree 
flames were aimed at a wall built of the stuff for two hours. After the test, 
the temperature on the other side of the wall had increased by only one degree, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rasnow said he is not completely convinced about Ener-Grid yet. It is not easy 
to obtain and has not been approved for use by Ventura County building 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be the greatest material in the world," said William Windroth, 
director of the county's Building and Safety Department. "But I personally 
haven't seen anything to prove that." 
</P>
<P>
 If using Ener-Grid proves too complicated, Rasnow said he will use something 
else. By the second anniversary of the fire, he wants to be well settled in. 
"Long before that," he said.

...AND NOW COME THE MOUNTAIN LIONS; CHANGES IN THEIR NATIVE HABITAT COULD BE A 
BOON FOR THE CATS, AUTHORITIES REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 The tiny sprouts peeping up from the charred chaparral in east Ventura County 
last fall looked innocent enough. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But authorities now say these survivors of the Green Meadow fire might be 
helping to bring two species at the top of the food chain -- mountain lions and 
humans -- into conflict more often. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a rarity, sightings of lions on the edge of the human world are on the 
rise throughout Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 And they might continue to rise because of the 1993 fire and the two rainy 
winters before it, wildlife biologists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The population definitely is up," said Morgan Boucke, a biologist with the 
state Fish and Game Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Because lions need large territories to hunt, a habitat change in one area -- 
such as the wide swath blackened by the fire in the east Santa Monica Mountains 
-- can induce the animals to migrate to new ranges, biologists say. 
</P>
<P>
 This could cause a ripple effect in lion communities throughout the eastern 
county and beyond, particularly after the current litters of cubs come of age. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to tell just how much of an effect this will have," Boucke 
said, "because it's first noticed in the herbivore (prey animal) population." 
</P>
<P>
 "The effect might be a couple of years away," concurred Paul Edelman, staff 
ecologist with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The big cats, historically limited in number by their food supply, suddenly 
are enjoying a lion's share of game, state biologist Chanelle Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mule deer, their favorite quarry because they are large and require fewer 
hunts, have multiplied in response to the lush new growth triggered by hot fire 
and cool rain, Warden John Wilcox of the state Fish and Game Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old decadent shrubs are very woody and can't support as many deer," plant 
ecologist Mary Meyer said. "(Deer) really thrive on the fresh re-sprouts." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to clearing the old growth and the ground litter that inhibits new 
sprouts, fire also releases such nutrients as potassium and nitrogen that can 
fertilize the soil, Meyer said. Some plant species even rely on fire for their 
seeds to germinate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have outstanding deer numbers now," said Wilcox, who patrols the Santa 
Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a high number of lions in the mountains," he added, "and I feel 
that's because there's plenty of forage for their prey population." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Female lions, healthier because of abundant food, can be more easily 
impregnated, have larger litters and experience lower mortality rates within 
them, Boucke said. She said more young cats are subsequently dispatched into 
already crowded lion territories, which can be 100 square miles or more. 
</P>
<P>
 For many lions, typically young males, this competition for ever-shrinking 
territories is fatal. "Most of the deaths of mountain lions occur because of 
other mountain lions," Davis said of the battles for domain. "They're pretty 
brutal." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox, unable to think of any prime lion habitat locally that is not already 
occupied -- indeed saturated -- said some cats are wandering into areas they 
previously might have avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, they're going to disperse farther," Boucke said. "And that's how new 
populations are established." 
</P>
<P>
 This could bring mountain lions closer to human development and to whatever 
new food source -- dogs, cats, livestock -- that might stray beyond the street 
lights and the cul-de-sacs, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We unknowingly have created a new food base -- dogs that are well-fed, cats 
that are well-fed, gardens that draw deer," Boucke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, because of the ban on lion hunting and the increasing frequency of 
contacts between lion and man, the behavior of the big cats might be evolving, 
Boucke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the pressure of hunting off, they're losing their fear of humans," 
Boucke said. "We're not a threat anymore. We're not shooting them. We're not 
hunting them with dogs. We may have somewhat created their elusive behavior in 
the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Ojai and Moorpark, lions, probably younger ones that are less experienced 
hunters, have even tried to attack horses in recent years, she added. All 
attacks failed, as did two in May in Agoura, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Miller, a ranger with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, said he 
found what appeared to be the claw marks of a lion on his quarter horse's rump 
on May 10. The sorrel mare apparently had been attacked during the night while 
in its corral in Agoura, about a mile south of the Ventura County line. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an interesting question, whether there are new niches being created 
for the young lions, and whether they're moving into new areas," ecologist 
Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons, freeways, Wildwood Park in Thousand Oaks, Jordan and Ahmanson ranches 
in east Ventura County, all can serve as temporary corridors through which 
lions can leave one territory, typically under the cover of night, and enter 
another, Boucke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of the cats' movement, though anecdotal, is indicative of a greater 
mixing of previously segregated populations, she said. Boucke noted that a lion 
was recently killed on the Santa Paula Freeway near Fillmore and another on a 
freeway in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Lions also have been seen crossing the Ventura Freeway, on the Conejo Grade 
east of Camarillo, where they could move from the west Santa Monicas to the 
ranges to the north, Boucke said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They also have been seen crossing the freeway in the Agoura Hills and 
Calabasas areas, where cats from the Santa Monicas can move into the Simi Hills 
of eastern Ventura County, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Always mobile creatures, the big cats even have been known to range as far as 
400 miles, if necessary, Boucke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually the movement is two directional," Wilcox said. "It's an outward push 
for the cats . . . and an inward push from human development. So what you 
actually have are two heads butting against each other."

PAMPERED POOCHES PUT ON THE DOG FOR CHARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The model looked dejected in her curlers and pink negligee. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's suffering the ultimate humiliation right now," said Hillary Replogle of 
Huntington Beach. "We're going to buy her a hamburger after this is over." 
</P>
<P>
 But Freckles the basset hound reluctantly ambled onto stage as Elvis Presley's 
"Hound Dog" blared from the sound system. She was one of 49 canine contestants 
who competed Saturday in the "Top Dog" fashion show at the Newport Dunes 
Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs trotted in with ballerina and cow costumes. Others wore tutus, bikinis 
and poodle skirts. One owner put her pug in a bicycle basket and dressed him as 
the extraterrestrial from the hit movie "E.T." 
</P>
<P>
 The show was held to raise money for the Orange County Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Dogs competed in six categories including 
best master/pet look-alike, swimwear, formal wear, lingerie, casual wear and 
Halloween costume. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such a success last year that we decided to do it again," said Lee 
Rutter of Newport Dunes Resort, a former stylist who came up with the idea for 
a dog fashion show. "It's just a riot working with dogs and people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some owners said it was doggone difficult getting their pets to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was supposed to be an angel, but she ate her costume," said Christine 
Peck of Newport Beach. So Dagmar, her German "honey dog" turned up at the show 
dressed as a devil. 
</P>
<P>
 Guido, a silky terrier owned by Paulette Downey of Santa Ana, came in a red 
baseball cap, white sweat shirt and blue jeans that matched Downey's ensemble. 
Not too happy with his newfound fashions, Guido had to be coaxed into the car 
with cookies, Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other canines needed more than a bribe. When Snuggles, a black Great Dane saw 
the pink poodle skirt she was to wear at the show, "She tore into the back room 
and we had to drag her out," said Kathy Van Domelen of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's top dog was Hokum, a brown Saluki who competed in all of the 
categories. She pranced onto the stage in black and silver sequins for the 
formal-wear competition and wore a leopard skin one-piece for the swimwear 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really had no idea that I'd be the Top Dog," said Zarah Mahler, 9, of Costa 
Mesa, as she stood petting Hokum after the show. She also entered Johnson, her 
other Saluki, to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very hard work because it took a lot of time, but my dogs were very 
patient," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she dressed up Hokum and Johnson every day for a week to get them 
used to their costumes. For her efforts, Zarah won a year's supply of pet food. 
 
</P>
<P>
 During the show, audience members cheered for their favorite dogs and laughed 
at owners who dragged uncooperative canines across the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was hysterical," said Pat Williams of the Petco store in Orange. 
"The imagination some of these people have dressing their dogs. . . . I'd like 
to see their kids at Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
 The event was co-sponsored by Petco and Iams, and the winners in each category 
received coupons for pet food. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Best master/pet look-alike: Bear, a 16-year-old black Labrador mix owned by 
Mary LaCrosse of Fountain Valley. Both came down the runway in matching 
blackbird outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best swimwear: Nikita, a white Samoyed owned by Elaine Ruettiger of Orange, 
wearing a colorful grass skirt and leis around the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best formal wear: Jimmy, a black Rottweiler owned by Sharon Montrief of 
Santa Ana, who was decked out in a top hat and bow. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best lingerie: Johnson the Saluki, wearing a purple and white harem costume 
with her hair tied in a ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best casual wear: Snuggles, a black, 180-pound Great Dane, owned by Kathy 
Van Domelen of Costa Mesa, who sashayed across the stage in her pink poodle 
skirt.  
</P>
<P>
 * Best Halloween costume: Mandy, a white lab owned by Kathy Dixon of 
Huntington Beach, who wore a clown costume complete with pointy hat and striped 
pants.

WOMAN KILLED AND 3 INJURED IN COLLISION ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old woman was killed Saturday morning on the Golden State Freeway 
when the driver of the car she was riding in lost control of the vehicle and 
collided with a truck, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 May Wong of Fresno was with three other family members heading south on the 
Golden State Freeway when the 9:12 accident occurred north of Vista Del Lago 
Road, said Officer Kerri Hawkins of the California Highway Patrol.The car 
caromed off the center railing and hit the truck broadside. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Wong's relatives, whose names were not released, were treated and 
released from Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. The third relative was listed in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 No one in the truck was injured, Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash closed off two lanes of the freeway for about 3 1/2 hours.

CAMARILLO MARKS ITS 30TH YEAR OF CITYHOOD QUIETLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City of Camarillo did what a lot of people do when they turn 30 -- it had 
a very low-key party.  
</P>
<P>
 No longer young and not yet old, Camarillo celebrated its 30th year of 
cityhood with a barbecue at Los Primeros School on Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Civic leaders turned out in force and at least 200 people showed up by early 
evening to dine on tri-tip sandwiches, hot dogs and free birthday cake provided 
by a local bakery. The party was scheduled to continue until 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not like turning 25 or turning 50," said Councilman Stan Daily. "We 
didn't want a big deal. You know, no political speeches or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Daily was standing with lifelong Camarillo resident Ned Chatfield, looking at 
a clipping from a local newspaper dated September, 1964, when voters approved 
incorporation. Both men had their pictures on the front page under a banner 
headline proclaiming the vote. And both were elected to Camarillo's first City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then the town has grown from about 13,000 residents to about 60,000, and 
the city's budget has ballooned from about $100,000 to over $30 million this 
year, Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Daily and Chatfield, many residents at Saturday's celebration have 
witnessed Camarillo's transformation. Rod Franz, a civic booster and member of 
the local Lion's Club, came to the area with his family in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came, you could see maybe one light from a ranch house as you came 
down the Conejo Grade," he said. "It's changed a lot since then." 
</P>
<P>
 Franz said this celebration was more subdued than most he has attended over 
the last 30 years because the city usually combines its annual fiesta with the 
birthday bash. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't plan anything big because the two weren't scheduled for the same 
weekend this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz acted as master of ceremonies for the celebration's small program. He 
introduced a troupe of young dancers and singers, called Fresh Chances for 
America, and the Camarillo Community Band. About 6 p.m. the band launched into 
a rendition of "Happy Birthday," while Mayor Ken Gose and the rest of the City 
Council cut the three-tiered birthday cake.

RESIDENTS DISCUSS LANDSLIDE FEARS WITH COUNTY OFFICIALS 
</P>

<P>
 Anxious residents of the tiny beachside community of La Conchita met with 
Ventura County officials at an outdoor meeting Saturday to discuss a recently 
discovered five-acre landslide that is threatening houses. 
</P>
<P>
 County geologist Jim Fisher said the 600-foot-high hillside is moving "very 
slowly" toward about eight houses on the north side of Vista del Rincon Road. 
The land is owned by La Conchita Ranch, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of the hillside have moved several inches since the landslide was 
discovered in June, Fisher said. But he said an earthquake or heavy rains could 
convert the brush-covered bluff into "an oozing mass of semi-consolidated mud 
and debris." 
</P>
<P>
 About 85 La Conchita residents attended the meeting, many toting video 
cameras, tape recorders and note pads. County officials estimate the area is 
home to about 400 people. County Supervisor Maggie Kildee and officials from 
the Sheriff's Department's office of emergency services addressed the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should any of us leave? Are we in danger of losing our lives?" one resident 
asked in a written, anonymous question to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to quantify the risk of a major landslide, county officials said 
residents had to weigh the risks for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher did say, however, that in the event of a major landslide, property 
damage was more likely than loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents said their property values were sliding downward faster than 
the earth on the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 George Caputo, whose house on Vista Del Rincon Road is about 100 feet from the 
foot of the slide, said he was concerned about property values "more than 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Olson's house near the foot of the landslide was for sale before the 
earth movement was even discovered. Now, she despairs of ever selling it, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents' fears are magnified by the presence of an oil pipeline 10 
inches in diameter that runs through the middle of the landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of Pacific Operators Offshore, which operates the pipeline, 
told residents the company plans within a week to install a system of gauges 
and a pressure-sensitive valve that would shut off the pipeline if the earth 
shifted significantly or if the pipe is ruptured. The company pumps crude oil 
for Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to have an oil-spill problem here, ladies and gentlemen, if 
we have a catastrophic landslide here," said Charlie Capell, a member of the 
oil company's board of directors. "You will have a landslide problem." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they were notified of the landslide in late August by 
the manager of La Conchita Ranch, who had noticed cracks in an access road that 
runs along the hillside. The ranch has already installed several wells designed 
to drain ground water that is contributing to the slide and for use in 
monitoring the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned about it," ranch manager David Orr said in an interview 
before the meeting. "There's some potential earth movement."

VALLEY BRIEFING: RATING THE LAWMAKERS; MEMBERS OF THE SENATE TAKE STOCK AFTER 
LEGISLATURE ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each year, thousands of bills are introduced in the Legislature by state 
lawmakers whose names or track records may mean little to the average voter. 
</P>
<P>
 While the decisions made in Sacramento may seem distant to Southern California 
residents, it is the state Capitol where many critical local issues get 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 From education to earthquake relief to economic reform, state legislators 
tackle a wide range of problems with solutions that sometimes typify which side 
of the ideological aisle the lawmaker occupies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, state legislators 
embrace a broad spectrum of views, ranging from the staunchest conservative to 
the most liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 To familiarize readers with area representatives, here is a look at highlights 
from the 1993-94 legislative session.

AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER; THOUSAND OAKS PUTS ON THE RITZ FOR CIVIC ARTS PLAZA'S 
CHRISTENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In their blue sequined gowns and starched tuxedos, in their long velvet capes 
and crisp dark suits, the guests clustered inside the lavender lobby of the 
Civic Arts Plaza and chatted -- about traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Or rather, the lack of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 They exclaimed over the easy trip down the Ventura Freeway. The smooth flow on 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard. The hassle-free parking in the well-lit garage. 
</P>
<P>
 From Camarillo, Simi Valley, Agoura Hills, even Canoga Park, they had flocked 
to opening night of Thousand Oaks' razzle-dazzle theater -- and they professed 
themselves awed at the sheer convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always had to drive down to Los Angeles for everything," Thousand Oaks 
resident Roxana Veltze said. "This is just grand." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Tony, looked a little aghast at his wife's enthusiasm. "We want 
to keep this hush-hush," he reminded her, only partially kidding. "We don't 
want everyone to know about this." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday and Saturday, it seemed everyone already knew. Thousand Oaks' 
Probst Auditorium hosted sell-out crowds both evenings for splashy 
grand-opening concerts featuring the Conejo Symphony Orchestra and Broadway 
star Bernadette Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many spectators agreed with Councilwoman Judy Lazar, who addressed the Friday 
night audience with a simple, heartfelt exclamation: "Aren't we lucky?" Before 
leaving the stage to the musicians, Lazar vowed, "We'll be back many times to 
party here together." 
</P>
<P>
 For this weekend's party, Thousand Oaks rolled out the red carpet. Guests 
emerging from the parking garage strode down a short red carpet into a crowded 
plaza, where a trombone-and-synthesizer duo struggled to be heard above the 
excited buzz. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a black-tie party Saturday for major donors, hundreds of people sipped 
champagne and nibbled on salmon and ham hors d'oeuvres. Architect Antoine 
Predock roamed the crowd, beaming and pausing to peer out windows and admire 
every facet of the building he designed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fantastic," Predock said. "It's a whole sort of adventure. People are 
using the places in this building like I never imagined." 
</P>
<P>
 On both evenings, patrons stood in lines a dozen deep at the bar to order 
drinks, and on Saturday mimes with their faces painted white entertained the 
crowd with exaggerated gestures befitting the blow-out party. 
</P>
<P>
 The lines at the bar were the only place there appeared to be a traffic jam 
before Saturday's performance. Outside along Thousand Oaks Boulevard and in the 
plaza's main parking lot, cars moved along at an efficient clip. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking attendant John Wimiarski said the black-tie crowd kept valet parking 
attendants twice as busy as Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
 John and Emily Freeman of Newbury Park -- who chose to park their car 
themselves -- found time to pause in the parking structure to consider the 
Chumash-inspired mosaic on the plaza's west wall. 
</P>
<P>
 John Freeman said the plaza is "so attractive and so convenient. . . . I kept 
telling my wife to hurry up, but it looks like we'll have time for an extra 
glass for champagne." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the weekend's celebrations, party-goers expressed pride and 
pleasure over the sprawling new complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that will make Thousand Oaks really special," Noomi 
Wennbergsaid. "It's great." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like many longtime Thousand Oaks residents, Wennberg and her husband, Jan, 
recalled bringing their children to the Jungleland wild animal park -- now the 
site of the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Curving rows of lilac seats have replaced the rusty lion cages, and a 
well-groomed park has covered the dried-up lagoon. But to some, the Civic Arts 
Plaza still retains echoes of Jungleland -- as a popular attraction sure to 
bring fame and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very proud of our city," Clarence Chatman said. A Thousand Oaks 
resident for 18 years, Chatman patiently held a stack of coats while his wife, 
daughter and neighbor took turns snapping photos of themselves in the 
auditorium lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Cora Chatman declared: "This event is very chic. Very elegant." All that 
elegance, however, bothered Madeline Adinoff just a tad. After all, Thousand 
Oaks prides itself on maintaining a small-town atmosphere -- and Adinoff wanted 
her city to uphold that reputation, in spite of the Broadway glitter. 
</P>
<P>
 So Adinoff parked herself at the door and welcomed guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the official greeter," she said. "I'm doing this for the love of the 
city, the people, the arts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Adinoff's greetings expressed Thousand Oaks' style, so did the brief 
ribbon-cutting ceremony before Friday's concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Alex Fiore and council members Judy Lazar and Frank Schillo addressed 
the crowd of 1,800, earning a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although council members Elois Zeanah and Jaime Zukowski attended Saturday's 
festivities, the two women -- the arts plaza's most outspoken critics -- did 
not show up for Friday's official opening. Their conspicuous absence from the 
podium underscored just how deeply -- and how bitterly -- the $86-million 
project has split the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore, who will retire next month after 30 years on the council, could not 
resist calling attention to that schism on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This first night has been a success by at least a 3-0 vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the politicians cleared the stage, symphony conductor Elmer Ramsey 
strode to his podium, and the orchestra launched into the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernadette Peters swooped into the spotlight after intermission decked out in 
a shimmery gold-and-white gown. 
</P>
<P>
 In a performance that delighted the crowd, Peters sang and shimmied and even 
waltzed into the audience. She belted out "We're in the Money" in pig Latin. 
And later she invited the orchestra musicians to join her on "The Glow Worm." 
</P>
<P>
 "Congratulations," Peters told the audience. "I'm so glad you recognize the 
importance of having performing arts centers. We need to have places where the 
soul can be fed -- and where I can work."

2 DIE IN SANTA ANA DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two gang-related drive-by shootings that occurred about an hour apart Friday 
night left two men dead, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first shooting took place around 9:30 p.m. in the 1700 block of West 
McFadden Avenue.Jose Luis Silva, 18, was riding his bicycle across the street 
when a vehicle approached him, said Sgt. Eric Vedborg. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was shot several times," Vedborg said. "One of the bullets struck him in 
the head and he died at the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Vedborg said Silva, a resident of Santa Ana, was a known gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 The second shooting occurred at 10:40 p.m. in the 1900 block of West 17th 
Street. Freddy Fernandez, 23, of Santa Ana was hit by several bullets fired 
from a car. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Fernandez) was walking down the street when a vehicle drove alongside of him 
and stopped. A passenger leaned out and fired a bunch of shots," Vedborg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange where he later died. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would release few details about the shootings on Saturday because they 
are still under investigation by gang investigators. No arrests have been made, 
Vedborg said.

LAPD MAY MANUFACTURE COCAINE FOR BAIT IN STINGS; DRUGS: THE AGENCY IS 
CONSIDERING PROVIDING CRACK -- MADE IN ITS OWN LABS, IF NEEDED -- TO UNDERCOVER 
OFFICERS FOR REVERSE STING OPERATIONS. OTHER DEPARTMENTS USE SIMILAR TACTICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Taking a cue from Orange County authorities, the officer in charge of 
street-level narcotics investigations for the Los Angeles Police Department is 
preparing a proposal to establish reverse sting operations to catch illegal 
drug users and, if necessary, manufacture rock -- or crack -- cocaine in police 
labs for use as bait. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the LAPD has never seriously considered such operations. But Capt. 
Bob Hansohn said the proposal he is preparing for consideration by Chief Willie 
L. Williams could put some officers on the street dealing drugs undercover much 
like police in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 There, 350 people have been arrested during the past 18 months by undercover 
police officers dealing county-made crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 If needed, Hansohn said LAPD officers could be supplied with rock cocaine 
manufactured by the Los Angeles crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have said most of those arrested in Orange County were first-time 
buyers and were assigned to drug diversion programs instead of receiving jail 
or prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the conventional methods aren't working, I believe we have the obligation 
to look at knocking out the problem in other ways," Hansohn said. "This 
proposal is just in the preliminary stages. (Chief Williams) may or may not 
agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena police have been selling street drugs, rather than those cooked by 
police, during reverse stings for about eight years, Lt. Jerry Schultze said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the court order approving Santa Ana's program, the Orange County district 
attorney's office cited two Pasadena cases in which state courts ruled that 
reverse stings were legal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inglewood Police Department has been selling rock cocaine undercover since 
1988, when it combined its program with a billboard campaign that warned: 
"Behind That Rock Could Be a Cop," Capt. Jim Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, authorities said their stings are intended to make small-time 
buyers eligible for harsher punishments. Deputy Dist. Atty. Carl Armbrust said 
Friday that the reverse stings help officers build felony rap sheets against 
users who will eventually be eligible for prison sentences if they are arrested 
a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler questioned whether the police 
actions amount to entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since most of these people are first-time offenders, you have to wonder if 
they would be purchasing drugs at all if the police weren't out there enticing 
them," Butler said. "I would seriously question the efficacy of their efforts. 
I think the motives are pure, but the means to the end seem to be really 
stretching it."  
</P>
<P>
 Armbrust and Santa Ana police officials defend the operations in which the 
Orange County Crime Laboratory has been manufacturing $10 and $20 pieces of 
rock cocaine for undercover officers to sell on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't measure the success of this program just by how many people end up 
in jail," said Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton. "We also rely on people in 
the neighborhoods to tell us whether things are getting better. I think we are 
seeing a significant degree of success here." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said his staff will file a legal brief as early as Monday, contending 
that the manufacture of the highly addictive crack cocaine amounts to 
"outrageous government conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's brief is patterned after a similar legal objection filed 
in Broward County, Fla., where a state appeals court ruled that the county 
sheriff acted illegally in manufacturing rock cocaine for undercover drug 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida ruling resulted in the reversal of hundreds of convictions 
obtained from reverse sting investigations.

SCHOOL MAY CLOSE BECAUSE OF FINANCES; EDUCATION: TEACHERS AND STUDENTS AT 
WORKMAN HIGH, THE SMALLEST CAMPUS IN HACIENDA-LA PUENTE DISTRICT, SAY THEY'RE 
READY TO FIGHT THE DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For the fourth time since 1980, the Hacienda-La Puente Unified School District 
is finding itself forced to close yet another school because of declining 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have not decided which school to close, but teachers and students 
from Workman -- the district's smallest high school -- are prepared to fight a 
decision they are certain will target them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been rumors for many years that they were going to close our 
school," said Joan Lavey, a Workman history teacher. "But this is the first 
time it's a real threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Blaming a poor economy and a loss of 11,000 students in the district since 
1971, Assistant Supt. John Rieckewald said, "We're in a constant state of 
having no resources." 
</P>
<P>
 The district cut $7 million in expenditures in the last two years, eliminating 
librarian, counselor and assistant principal positions, as well as stripping 
health services "down to the bare bones," Rieckewald said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've cut everything we can cut," he said. "The reality is that it didn't 
give us flexibility or surplus. It just kept us from running into the 
reserves." 
</P>
<P>
 Integrating Workman's 1,145 students into the district's three other high 
schools could save the district up to $700,000, but parents and students are 
concerned the decision will lead to overpopulated classrooms and increased gang 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is going to get any schooling done," said Heidi Lopez, a recent 
graduate of Workman who attended a Save Our School meeting last week along with 
hundreds of parents, students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is worried about her twin sisters, who are freshmen at Workman but would 
attend La Puente High School if Workman is closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are gangs that hang out at both schools," she said. "If Workman kids go 
to La Puente, there's going to be more violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Because almost half of Workman students are from La Puente, it is widely 
assumed that many of those Workman students will transfer to La Puente High 
School, which has 1,638 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it is, La Puente is overcrowded," lamented Diana Marquez, who has three 
young children. "As soon as I rise in income, I'm taking my kids out of this 
district." 
</P>
<P>
 Rieckewald said that even if every Workman student transferred to La Puente 
High School, there would still be 77 fewer students than the school had in 
1981. "I'm not saying they'd all go to La Puente, but I am saying it would be a 
manageable number if they did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials also are considering the integration of elementary schools 
with junior high schools or junior high schools with high schools. The district 
can save $250,000 for each elementary school closed and up to $550,000 for each 
junior high school closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators will make their recommendation to the Board of Education in 
early December so that they can close the school or schools before next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rieckewald said, "There's nothing etched in stone that it has to be Workman," 
but students and teachers are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students feel they're being robbed of what's theirs," said Workman senior 
Xochitl BautistaC in a speech to cheering supporters. "And we're not willing to 
give it up."

COLUMN ONE; COURTS TOSS CURVES AT '3 STRIKES'; TIMES STUDY FINDS ONLY 1 IN 6 
ELIGIBLE DEFENDANTS GETS 25 YEARS TO LIFE AS JUDGES, PROSECUTORS EASE 
SENTENCING. BUT MANY GET LONGER TERMS THAN THEY WOULD HAVE PREVIOUSLY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County judges and prosecutors have considerably softened the blow 
of California's new "three strikes" law, sending only one in six eligible 
defendants to prison for the 25 years to life prescribed for three-time losers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the six months since the law was enacted, in fact, defendants in cases 
involving third "strikes" were just as likely to be sentenced to a year in jail 
as they were to be put away for life, a study by The Times found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reviewed all 98 "third-strike" cases that were resolved between 
March, when the law took effect, and Aug. 31. Defendants in most of these cases 
were shoplifters and drug abusers. Fewer than one in five were accused of 
crimes of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most defendants were spared life sentences, many received longer 
terms than they would have before "three strikes" because the threat of life 
terms gave prosecutors more leverage to negotiate tougher plea bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a man who stole diapers from a supermarket was sentenced to eight 
years in prison, and another was sent away for eight years for possession of a 
rock of cocaine and a bag of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the new law has thus far ensnared mainly drug users and 
burglars, underscoring the complaints of critics who say that the law targets 
the wrong defendants. Of the 94 men and women charged under the new law, only 
18 face new felony charges for crimes of violence, according to a list of 
"three strikes" defendants compiled by the Orange County district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding whether repeat offenders should get life, a year in jail, or 
something in between can be a wrenching experience for judges and prosecutors. 
"When talking about a person's life, there's no such thing as an easy 
decision," said Philip H. Wynn, head deputy district attorney in the Van Nuys 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 crimes that are felonies under California law, ranging from 
placing a bet in an office pool to murder, can constitute a third "strike" 
under the law if an offender has been previously convicted of two or more 
serious or violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The law makes no distinction between offenses. As a result, many judges and 
some prosecutors have tried to draw their own lines. Some have differentiated 
between violent and nonviolent crimes, while others have given special 
consideration to defendants whose most serious offense was far behind them, The 
Times found. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Judge Carol J. Fieldhouse, a key member of the Los Angeles County 
Superior Court's special committee to study the impact of "three strikes," said 
that although violent criminals deserve to be sent away for life, people he 
considers to be "nuisances" do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refuse to dispense injustice," Fieldhouse said, adding that judges must 
find ways to "outwit" the law. "I wasn't put here to annihilate people because 
some politically hungry morons wanted (me) to." 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" law signed by Gov. Pete Wilson in March was intended to 
toughen sentencing of repeat offenders by limiting the discretion of judges and 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, which voters will be asked to reaffirm on the Nov. 8 ballot in 
the form of Proposition 184, criminals with one prior conviction for serious or 
violent crimes are supposed to be sentenced to double the usual term. Criminals 
with two or more such "strikes" who commit any new felony are subject to a 
prison term of triple the usual amount of time or 25 years to life, whichever 
is greater. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, however, also preserves some discretion for prosecutors by giving 
them the authority to ignore a defendant's past "strike" in the "furtherance of 
justice." Judges were not explicitly given that authority. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times analysis of the 98 resolved "third-strike" cases found that although 
some felons are getting longer prison terms, judges and prosecutors have 
exercised their powers to moderate the impact of the new law. In court and in 
interviews, they emphasized their obligation to act in the interest of justice 
within the constraints of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to bend over backward to be fair to community, the intent of 
legislation, the spirit of the law and, at the same time, be fair to the person 
charged with the crime," said Wynn of the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said in an interview that some of his prosecutors 
find it traumatic to seek a life sentence for a minor offense, even if a 
defendant's criminal history is serious. But, he said, prosecutors have to 
adjust their "mind-set" to the community's growing impatience with business as 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
 What prosecutors "feel is justice may be at odds with what the community wants 
or expects in terms of justice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of the "three strikes" law, Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno), 
indicated that he was not surprised by The Times' findings. Acknowledging that 
district attorneys and judges retain considerable discretion, he said he never 
expected that everyone who was eligible would get life terms. But he said he 
believes the law is effective as a deterrent by telling would-be three-time 
losers: "Stop committing felonies in California." 
</P>
<P>
 In the cases examined by The Times, judges and prosecutors largely agreed on 
how to handle more serious offenses, such as residential burglary, robbery or 
rape. But judges concluded that prosecutors did not show enough defendants the 
compassion they deserved. In those cases, judges acted on their own to reduce 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy district attorneys gave breaks to 25 defendants, while judges took 
action that benefited 27 more. In cases in which prosecutors ignored a 
"strike," the average prison term was five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some judges claimed pre-existing law gave them the power to ignore a past 
"strike" even though "three strikes" did not. More commonly, they used their 
well-established authority to reduce certain felonies to misdemeanors, which 
are punishable by no more than a year in jail. In cases in which judges 
intervened, defendants went away for an average of 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen of the 97 defendants were sentenced to life and another is awaiting 
imposition of a life term. Thirty-one others had their cases dropped or settled 
because the prosecution did not have enough evidence against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said he has been told by his staff that they are exercising their 
discretion to ignore "strikes" in fewer than 10% of all "third-strike" cases. 
He said the Times study overstated his office's willingness to ignore "strikes" 
by looking only at resolved cases, and not the more than 800 "third-strike" 
cases filed in the same period that are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he was troubled by the inconsistencies in sentences documented 
by The Times, but blamed them on judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should one person get a one-year county jail sentence and the other get, 
in essence, a life sentence?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, those who received the maximum sentence had committed more serious 
offenses as their third "strike." They had burglarized a residence while a 
terrified homeowner watched, held up a gas station armed with a pellet gun or 
sodomized a cellmate at knifepoint. 
</P>
<P>
 But their ranks also included people who stole a bicycle, sold a single rock 
of cocaine to an undercover police officer or were seen by police in a parked 
stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal history of those who got life and those who received lighter 
sentences appeared similar. Most were thieves with drug habits, according to 
probation reports and criminal histories, and most had been convicted in the 
past of at least one crime of violence, such as robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 At an average age of 35, they were a decade older than the age at which 
experts figure the average criminal is most active. Most were unemployed and 
many were homeless, such as John B. Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 One hot day in July, Fernandez -- still on parole after a 1982 armed-robbery 
conviction -- plucked two 40-ounce bottles of beer from a cooler in a San 
Fernando liquor store and told the clerk to call police; he'd be drinking the 
beer outside. Fernandez later told police he wanted to go back to prison 
because "he was hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the nature of Fernandez's offense, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Vezzani 
chose to ignore a "strike" -- a 1981 robbery conviction. In turn, Fernandez 
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison, a 
more severe penalty than he would likely have received prior to "three 
strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Vezzani wrote in the case file that he asked his superiors for permission to 
handle the case as a misdemeanor, but was denied. He complained that such 
decisions will cause the system to be flooded with trivial cases. "This is a 
classic example of why the law is doomed to destruction -- the sooner the 
better," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the district attorney's office, there are conflicting views as to how 
the law should be applied. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of his colleagues, Dist. Atty. Garcetti favors a version of "three 
strikes" that would target only serious or violent offenders with life terms. 
But he has directed his deputies in written memos to enforce the law fully and 
to use their discretion to cut deals only in "rare" cases. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting in August, supervisors from the branch offices were split over 
whether that policy was just. Some said their scruples demanded that they be 
given greater discretion to ignore prior "strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Denis K. Petty, the head prosecutor in Torrance, said he told Garcetti that he 
intended to follow his own conscience in deciding when it was appropriate to 
seek life sentences on a third "strike." According to him and others who 
attended the meeting, Garcetti said nothing. Petty said he took that to be 
tacit approval of his position, and said he has since shown mercy to more 
three-time losers than any of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Isaac Peoples is a case in point. Petty said he could not bring himself 
to "put a guy away for 25 to life for stealing underwear." So Petty ignored one 
"strike" and Peoples pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Other supervisors have said they feel obligated to follow Garcetti's written 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's fair, but it's the law, and I have a duty to enforce the 
law," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth C. Wullschleger, a supervisor in the 
Downtown criminal courts building. He said he has sought life sentences against 
drug users even though he personally believes the punishment to be unjust. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges have criticized the district attorney's office for failing to exercise 
discretion more often. Many have tried to make deals on their own, over the 
D.A.'s objection and despite the fact that the law does not empower them to 
ignore a "strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Superior Court Judge Arthur Jean decided to intervene in the case 
of Calvin Bailey, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who had been convicted in 1986 of two robberies, faced life 
imprisonment for walking out of K Mart with $225 worth of merchandise that 
included toothpaste, razors, a camera and a pair of jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean decided to ignore one of Bailey's "strikes" and sentence him to seven 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a basic shoplifting situation, to commit somebody to prison for life 
appears to me to be foolish, foolish and unfair -- terribly, terribly unfair 
and wrong," Jean said in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have appealed his decision, arguing that only they have the power 
to ignore a "strike." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the appellate courts will make me do these things," Jean said from the 
bench. "I hope not. I hope to God not." 
</P>
<P>
 Many predict that pressure will grow to make deals. With "three strikes" still 
in its infancy, much of the debate within the judiciary and the district 
attorney's office has focused on issues of fairness and justice. But, with 
time, more practical concerns may dominate the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of August, 800 cases involving a third "strike" remained 
unresolved. Most of those cases will go to trial unless prosecutors and judges 
cut deals. If they don't, there will be a shortage of courtrooms, judges, 
public defenders and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The math is simple but powerful: Before "three strikes," an overburdened court 
system resolved its caseload because district attorneys and judges used plea 
bargains to settle nine of every 10 felony cases before trials. A "three 
strikes" defendant facing 25 years to life is unlikely to plead guilty unless 
someone offers him a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "A huge wave (of trials) is building and building and building," said Los 
Angeles County Public Defender Michael P. Judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, criminal cases are trickling into civil courtrooms. One judge 
reported that he has interrupted civil trials -- sending home plaintiffs, 
defendants and witnesses -- to make room for criminal defendants who are 
entitled to speedy trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the system reaches the point where it is bulging and exploding, which it 
will . . . I think D.A.s will exercise more discretion," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Peter Berman, a supervisor in the Downtown criminal courts building. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, however, said he has no intention of giving his deputies greater 
leeway to settle cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect there will be more judges who will feel the pressure of the number 
of cases that the criminal system has to deal with and start exercising their 
discretion," he said, promising to fight those who intervene too often. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, judges and district attorneys are searching for standards of 
fairness to apply to the myriad cases they handle daily. The six cases detailed 
here illustrate the variety of solutions that have emerged from that collective 
search. The Rapist 
</P>
<P>
 While many prosecutors and judges wrestle with their consciences over sending 
shoplifters and drug abusers to prison for life, none expressed such concerns 
for Hilton Booker. 
</P>
<P>
 Booker, 37, began getting in trouble as a teen-ager when he was convicted of 
robberies, burglaries and drug possession. Over the next two decades, the 
criminal justice system was a revolving door that repeatedly put him back on 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Without fail, Booker would be arrested within months of his release from 
prison -- for robbery, stealing a car, shooting at a house or fighting, 
according to probation records. He accrued 10 aliases and came to be known in 
prison as "Prince." 
</P>
<P>
 A month after his release in June, 1993, Booker was arrested for the rape of a 
prostitute in Lancaster. While serving a prison sentence in that case, he and a 
partner beat up and repeatedly raped a fellow cellmate at knifepoint. 
</P>
<P>
 A sentencing report prepared by the Probation Department said Booker "could 
easily fit the description of the type of convict the community has been 
talking about who should probably spend, if not the rest of his life, at least 
25 years (in prison)." 
</P>
<P>
 Booker was sentenced in August to 42 years to life by a judge who piled on 
extra penalties. The Shoplifter 
</P>
<P>
 Terrence J. Carello had been shoplifting meals three or four times a day from 
his neighborhood Lucky's in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot, 5-inch Carello had more than one conversation with the store's 
much-smaller security guard about his habit of not paying for food. He informed 
the guard that he planned to continue stealing food for his family. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, however, a police officer happened by soon after one of Carello's 
visits and caught him with pilfered pancake mix, syrup, sausages and Kool-Aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Carello had racked up six shoplifting convictions during one three-year period 
in the early 1980s. As a teen-ager and young adult, he had committed a robbery 
and a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he faced 25 years to life until Patricia Ryan, who heads the 
district attorney's Long Beach office, agreed to ignore one of the previous 
offenses. She said she was willing to accept less than life in prison because 
Carello had not been violent or even threatening in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Carello will go to state prison for more than 10 years. Before "three 
strikes," the offense probably would have gotten him no more than a few months 
in jail. The Drug Abuser 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Allen Lyon had been arrested for jaywalking. Then the deputy who 
stopped him found he was carrying enough methamphetamine to get him high, or 
send him to prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon, 39, had been in and out of jails and prisons for 20 years on drug and 
theft charges related to his almost daily use of marijuana, heroin, cocaine and 
speed, according to a probation report. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of his thefts -- a robbery and residential burglary he had committed 12 
years ago -- were classified as "serious," and the charge of drug possession 
was his third "strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Superior Court Judge Dino Fulgoni thought a life sentence in Lyon's 
case was inappropriate. Such a penalty would have been an "unconscionable way 
to treat the defendant, who is a pathetic drug addict, and an unconscionable 
way to treat the people of California, because they need the prison space for 
people who are more violent, currently, than he is," Fulgoni said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this guy belongs in prison; don't get me wrong," Fulgoni said. "But 
he comes far from belonging in prison for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulgoni said he does not believe he has the authority to ignore a "strike." So 
he exercised another option: He reduced Lyon's drug charge to a misdemeanor. 
Misdemeanors, by definition, carry a penalty of no more than a year in jail. 
That's what Lyon got. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the cooperation of the D.A., the statute gives me the option of 
putting him in jail for a year for a misdemeanor or committing the injustice of 
putting him in jail for life," Fulgoni said. The Diaper Thief 
</P>
<P>
 The case against Rudy Roman Rodriguez was simple. "He told officers that he 
had been drinking a little, he remembered that he needed some diapers at home, 
so he went and took some," a probation officer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 31, who had been convicted of robberies in 1982 and 1990, was 
caught this time shoplifting a $29.99 pack of Huggies from a Downey 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk Superior Court Judge Robert W. Armstrong, who could not see sentencing 
Rodriguez to life, maneuvered prosecutors into a compromise by threatening to 
reduce the charge to a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors agreed to ignore a "strike," which allowed Armstrong to sentence 
Rodriguez to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were not willing to back down on this . . . I would have taken it 
into my own hands and he'd have gotten a year," the judge said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong said he felt it was his "obligation to temper justice with mercy. . 
. . I'm not going to be cowed by politicians who I think are pandering to the 
public to take advantage of the public's fear of crime." The Abusive Boyfriend 
</P>
<P>
 In Christopher Renault Kinsey, prosecutors had a chance to lock away forever 
someone they thought was a menace. But they also had a problem: a weak case. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsey, 30, was accused of attacking his live-in girlfriend days before she 
was to give birth to their second child. But the victim wasn't willing to 
cooperate, even though Kinsey had served prison time for assaulting her while 
she was pregnant with their first child. 
</P>
<P>
 With their key witness shaky, prosecutors offered Kinsey six years in return 
for a guilty plea. He wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsey decided to try his luck with a jury. If his gamble failed, he would 
almost certainly face life because of his long, violent record. He had been 
convicted of two attempted robberies at ATM machines and the robbery of a woman 
pushing a baby stroller. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Mitchell Bruckner, Kinsey 
changed his mind 15 minutes into jury selection, but the prosecutor told him 
that her supervisor said the deal was no longer on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You're 15 minutes too late,' " Bruckner recalled the prosecutor telling 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Meredith Rust, remembered it somewhat 
differently. It was more like two hours, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsey was convicted and sentenced to 29 years to life. The Tire Thief

<P>
 Girmai Gabremahdin, 27, was headed for life in prison until Long Beach Judge 
William T. Garner stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 During a monthlong, cocaine-driven crime spree that began in December, 1986, 
Gabremahdin was a notorious "bump-and-run" bandit in Santa Monica. He pleaded 
guilty to robbing 21 women, most of them lone motorists whose cars he had 
intentionally hit so he could grab their purses. 
</P>
<P>
 He served four years of an eight-year sentence, then stayed out of big trouble 
until 2 a.m. one rainy night last March, a week after the "three strikes" law 
became effective. Gabremahdin's car got a flat tire and he didn't have a spare. 
</P>
<P>
 He was caught taking one from a Wilmington junkyard; a jury convicted him of 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner acknowledged Gabremahdin's violent criminal past but refused to 
sentence him to life. Instead, he sentenced him to a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a misdemeanor," Garner said. "It should have been prosecuted as a 
misdemeanor." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Dolores (Dee) Turner, who prosecuted the case, called 
Garner's decision outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever we think about the statute, the Legislature clearly intended this 
guy when they passed it," she said.

MOMENTUM BUILDS IN LAGUNA; RECOVERY: AS FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF FIRESTORM 
APPROACHES, BURNED-OUT HOMEOWNERS HAVE SHAKEN OFF SHOCK AND QUICKENED PACE OF 
RECONSTRUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nearly every weekday, Martha Lydick visits her fire-scarred Mystic Hills lot, 
watching with growing excitement as workers make steady progress toward 
replacing the home she lost one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Toting a small automatic camera, Lydick, 52, joyfully records each tiny step 
forward, adding the latest photographs -- of concrete caissons, retaining walls 
or the newest sprigs on her ground cover -- to a bulging red album now almost a 
foot thick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, after all this time, we're on our way home," she says, her voice 
heavy with relief. "Now we know it's really going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 For Lydick, her husband, Lawrence, and many other victims of last October's 
devastating Laguna firestorm, the early frustrations and fears have given way 
to hope as the din of construction echoes across once-blackened canyons. Heavy 
trucks lumber along the narrow streets, barren lots sprout contractors' signs 
and the buzz of saws competes with the pounding of hammers in a welcome 
cacophony. 
</P>
<P>
 One year after the most destructive fire in Orange County history hopscotched 
across this seaside community, nearly two-thirds of those who lost their homes 
have begun the laborious task of rebuilding. The Oct. 27 blaze destroyed or 
damaged 321 homes here and 120 more in the unincorporated enclaves of Emerald 
Bay and the El Morro trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only four new homes owned by fire survivors have been completed so 
far in Laguna -- and none is yet finished in Emerald Bay -- the pace of 
rebuilding has quickened lately, city and county officials said. About 70 "fire 
rebuilds" are under construction inside the Laguna Beach city limits, with 
about 20 more on their way in Emerald Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as the anniversary approaches, many who lost homes to the flames recall 
with chagrin the goals they set for themselves early on. Some were certain they 
would be back in their homes by the Labor Day that passed last month. If delays 
cropped up, maybe Thanksgiving, they said, but by Christmas for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, slowed by geologic uncertainties, disputes with neighbors -- or 
simply still stunned by their losses -- many have yet to break ground. Across 
Laguna, lots still lie vacant, marked by charred chimneys and blackened trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were naive," concedes Robert F. Gentry, a longtime Laguna city councilman 
who lost both his Mystic Hills home and a Skyline Drive rental property. "None 
of us knew anything about what it takes to build a house under these 
circumstances. We'd never done it before." 
</P>
<P>
 The handful of houses rebuilt in time for the anniversary is far fewer than 
almost anyone imagined. But most interviewed said the pace seems slow primarily 
because of unrealistic hopes, not unreasonable delays by government agencies, 
insurance companies, architects or others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm distressed at how long everything takes, but I can't blame anybody," said 
Cort Kloke, 47, whose plans for his new Mystic View home are scheduled to be 
heard by Laguna's Design Review Board on Thursday, the anniversary of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have never done this before. My expectations weren't founded on 
knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in several areas, the Laguna fire victims appear to have outpaced 
their counterparts who lost homes in the deadly Oakland hills blaze three years 
ago. Twenty-five people died in that October, 1991, wildfire, another 150 were 
injured and about 2,700 homes were incinerated, making the size and scope of 
the blaze far greater than in Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 By the first anniversary of the Oakland blaze, 78% of the fire victims had 
reached at least partial settlements with their insurers, although many 
homeowners later were found to be underinsured, according to a spokeswoman for 
the state Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna, 98% of the claims have by now resulted in at least a partial 
settlement, according to the Los Angeles-based Western Insurance Information 
Service, a consumer education group affiliated with the industry. Comparable 
statistics from the Department of Insurance will not be completed for several 
weeks, spokeswoman Candysse Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oakland, one year after the fire, 38% of those who lost their homes had 
filed the paperwork required to start the rebuilding process, according to city 
officials. Now, at the three-year mark, 75% of the dwelling units have been 
rebuilt or are under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna, one year later, nearly two-thirds of those whose homes were 
destroyed, or 189 of 286 households within the city limits, already have 
embarked on rebuilding. In Emerald Bay, nearly half of the 60 destroyed homes 
are in the process of rebuilding. And in the El Morro Beach Mobile Home Park 
north of Laguna, owners already have replaced 34 of the 40 trailers consumed by 
the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "From everything I've heard, people have been much better off in Laguna," said 
Robert Bruce, publisher of the East Bay Journal, a newspaper that he started as 
the Phoenix Journal, dedicated solely to survivors of the Oakland blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce, who lost his home and nearly everything else in that fire, helped lead 
seminars last year for fire victims in Laguna and Altadena. His newspaper also 
organized a buddy program that matched families in Oakland with those in 
similar circumstances in three burned-out Southern California communities, 
including Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, rebuilding delays for Oakland fire victims involved insurance 
problems, but with few exceptions that has not been a major issue in Laguna, 
according to city officials, community leaders and fire victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the most common reasons for delays in Laguna involved disputes among 
neighbors -- often stemming from fire victims' desires to replace their 
burned-out homes with grander dwellings -- as well as geological concerns 
raised last spring about the stability of several charred hillsides. In Emerald 
Bay, architects and builders complained of a bottleneck in obtaining grading 
permits from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 And some fire victims have simply been unable to cope yet with their losses or 
with the myriad decisions that come with rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach architect Brion Jeannette, who is designing new homes for five 
clients, suspected that something wasn't right when some of his clients 
couldn't come to grips with simple design decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, people can decide pretty quickly on what kind of faucets to use in 
the bathroom or what color for the kitchen counter," Jeannette said. "But it 
was really difficult for some of them to get going. Little decisions started to 
become major decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette said he eventually realized that even though fire victims had 
engaged architects, builders and interior designers, many were still 
traumatized by the loss of their homes and belongings. Some of his clients are 
only now "coming out of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patsy Dickerman was one Laguna resident who had been through the regrouping 
and rebuilding process before. In 1969, a fire destroyed her home in Austin, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that I'd been through it before meant that I understood what was 
going to happen," she said. "I learned that things can be replaced . . . and if 
you were not hurt, and nobody you loved was hurt, then a fire is just a major 
inconvenience. Things will get better." 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Dickerman, 45, gently counseled her husband, Jim, not to spend 
time searching through the ashes of their Vista Lane home. "I told him that 
looking back only hurts," she said. "It keeps you in the past. And from that 
day . . . we focused on moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the fire, the Dickermans leased a house in Laguna Beach. Within 
weeks, they had hired a builder and an architect. In March, they received their 
building permit -- the second of about 75 that so far have been granted to fire 
victims preparing to rebuild. Their new home is expected to be completed in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 But others who hoped to return home relatively quickly ran into opposition 
from an unexpected source: their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the fire, city officials encouraged property owners to build homes 
of about the same size as before, but allowed them to increase the size up to 
49% without a design review, if they could show they would not block views or 
infringe on their neighbors' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 If they chose to build homes that were even larger, they were warned, they 
would have to endure Laguna's lengthy design review process. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, about 80 of the fire victims so far have gone through design review 
hearings or signaled their intention to do so. Of those, 30% to 40% have been 
marked by bitter conflicts with neighbors, usually concerning view obstruction, 
said Bob Chapman, chairman of the Design Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Bode, director of an umbrella group formed to help the fire victims, 
considers the neighborhood disputes the single most distressing aspect of the 
fire's aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these hearings have been really acrimonious," said Bode, who heads 
the Laguna Fire Relief Coalition. "Now, in most of these cases they're going to 
have to live next door to each other and try to forget about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The progress of yet other homeowners was blocked by a landslide scare in three 
fire-damaged neighborhoods, Mystic Hills, Temple Hills and Canyon Acres. 
Geologists discovered evidence that led them to believe that ancient landslides 
might exist under some of the burned-out lots. For a time, the issue threatened 
to derail the rebuilding plans of scores of fire victims and is still delaying 
a handful. 
</P>
<P>
 The landslides, which were later found to be smaller than originally feared or 
not to exist at all, prompted emotional, angry meetings between fire victims 
and Laguna officials, particularly after the city imposed a building moratorium 
while geologists investigated the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, most residents were allowed to rebuild, but in Mystic Hills, about 
a dozen property owners are still unable to move forward because of continuing 
uncertainty about the stability of their lots. Some, like longtime Laguna 
residents Polly and Sol Sloan, have decided to buy homes elsewhere rather than 
wait for the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Polly Sloan and others have criticized Laguna Beach officials for being overly 
concerned about liability and unnecessarily delaying the return home of many 
fire victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of equivocation on the part of the city and some of the 
geologists," Sloan said. "It's clearly very important for them to protect their 
own interests, more important than to get these property owners back in their 
homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna City Manager Kenneth C. Frank strongly defends the decisions, saying 
the city would have been irresponsible to have allowed property owners to 
rebuild without first investigating geological evidence that appeared to point 
to ancient landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the complaints were unfair, although based on legitimate fears and 
uncertainty," Frank said. "I think we did exactly what we should have done." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, on most issues -- and in some cases, including the landslide question 
-- many fire victims give the city high marks for its handling of the crisis, 
especially its efforts to streamline the rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given that there were surprises and unknowns they couldn't control, I think 
they've done a good job," Bode said. "There's been a real spirit of goodwill." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, city officials decided early on to waive most rebuilding fees 
for fire victims. They tried to accelerate the process too, reducing the number 
of projects that were required to go to design review. Additional staff was 
hired for planning and zoning, and a San Diego planning firm was engaged to 
help with the workload. 
</P>
<P>
 In all but a few cases, Frank said, the city has managed to keep a promise to 
maintain a five-day turnaround time for the plan-checking phase of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a major city and, given that a fire of this sort is not an 
everyday occurrence, I think the planning that went into the city's efforts was 
quite solid," said David Horne, a fire victim who heads the activist Mystic 
Hills Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Builder David A. Scholar, whose projects include an award-winning house for 
fire victims Doug and Rebecca Wood, agreed, saying the city has been good at 
keeping its promises. "They've stuck to their original commitment to streamline 
permitting," Scholar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Lydick, whose rebuilding was held up during the landslide 
investigation, confesses to having harbored less friendly feelings toward city 
officials during the six months she and her husband, Lawrence, a U.S. District 
Court judge, were forced to wait for a building permit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the day they got it, on Aug. 25, "my shoulders came down," she said. "I 
guess I was constantly prepared for battle." 
</P>
<P>
 And now that the construction has started, Lydick said she is focusing on the 
positive, reinforced by her daily visits to the steep hillside lot and the 
beautiful home she expects to move into next spring. Her goal, she says, is to 
watch the fireworks from her house on July 4. Rebuilding a City 
</P>
<P>
 Last autumn's fire destroyed or damaged 441 homes in Laguna Beach and the 
surrounding unincorporated areas. As of Friday, only four homes have been 
completely rebuilt and fewer than 100 building permits have been issued. 
</P>
<P>
 * Homes destroyed: 286 within city limits 
</P>
<P>
 * Homes damaged: 35 within city limits 
</P>
<P>
 * The toll in unincorporated areas: 120 homes destroyed or damaged 
</P>
<P>
 * City zone plan checks: 189 applications submitted 
</P>
<P>
 * City structural plan checks: 114 applications submitted 
</P>
<P>
 * City building permits: 75 issued 
</P>
<P>

LAPD OFFICER DIES OF WOUNDS FROM SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever a Los Angeles police officer has been killed in the line of duty 
during the last five years, colleagues have soberly marked the officer's 
absence by including a riderless horse in the funeral procession. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, there will be no horse when police gather to say farewell to 
Officer Charles Dean Heim, who died early Saturday after being gunned down at a 
Hollywood motel the night before. For it was Heim whose duty it was to lead the 
horse. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting also left Heim's partner wounded. Police are still searching for 
the man they believe committed the crimes, identified as Manuel Vargas Perez, 
26, an alleged gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Heim's) wife requested that there be no riderless horse at Chuck's funeral 
because that was Chuck's detail," said Sgt. Kirk Smith, the slain officer's 
longtime supervisor in the LAPD's mounted unit, part of the elite Metropolitan 
Division. Heim's wife, also an LAPD officer, is assigned to the same division. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old Heim, on temporary assignment to the LAPD's Hollywood 
Division, was shot when he and his partner, Officer Felix F. Pena, 35, followed 
up on a tip given to them during a traffic stop on a run-down strip of Sunset 
Boulevard. They were told someone was dealing drugs from a motel room in the 
same block. 
</P>
<P>
 They knocked on the door of the room at the Dunes Motel, and the suspect's 
girlfriend opened it, department sources said. When Heim stepped into the 
doorway, someone began shooting, striking Heim and wounding Pena in the right 
hand before Heim could draw his gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "There weren't even words exchanged," said one officer familiar with the 
shooting. "The guy just opened fire." Police did not divulge whether they have 
uncovered a motive for the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Another officer at the scene, Armen Sedvalian, ran to the doorway, exposing 
himself to the gunfire, and pulled Heim away, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heim, shot twice in the upper body, died a few hours later at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center. Pena, assigned to the Hollywood Division, was treated at Queen 
of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center and released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the shooting, SWAT officers were called to the scene and 
cordoned off the area, believing that the suspect might be barricaded in the 
second-story room. But he had apparently jumped from the bathroom window and 
escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Heim, an 11-year veteran of the force, is the second LAPD officer to be shot 
to death within the last year and the 10th Southland law enforcement officer to 
be gunned down in the last year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 22, rookie Officer Christy Hamilton became the second female in LAPD 
history to die in the line of duty, when a teen-ager in Northridge cut her down 
with a semiautomatic assault rifle. It was Heim who led the riderless horse at 
her funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Others killed in the Southland over the last 20 months include two Palos 
Verdes Estates police officers, an Oxnard policeman, a Riverside sheriff's 
officer, a Manhattan Beach policeman, a Garden Grove police officer and two 
Compton police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the living room of their Diamond Bar home Saturday afternoon, Beth 
Heim said she first learned of Friday night's shooting when a friend, Officer 
Michelle Botello, called to say two unidentified officers had been hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she said that, I knew immediately it was him," said the widow, pregnant 
with the couple's first child. "I don't know why. I just knew." 
</P>
<P>
 When the child, due in March, is old enough, she said, "we'll go to the police 
memorial and I'll point out his name. I'll explain what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The slain officer also leaves a 12-year-old son, Charles Heim II, who lives 
with Heim's ex-wife in Kernville. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Heim, who has been on the force for a decade, recalled how she met her 
husband of three years when they were paired in the same patrol car in 
Hollywood. A year and half later they began dating. Their first outing was a 
memorable one. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me to go riding with him. I ended up in the emergency room with my 
eye split open and my hand gashed," she said. "I was riding a horse of his 
named Slick. Chuck tried to warn me. But I wanted to ride him bareback and I 
got thrown off." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband enjoyed bareback bronco riding and sometimes rode bulls in police 
rodeos, she said. "He got hurt every time. He had a broken thumb, cracked ribs, 
seven stitches in his head, a bruised kidney." 
</P>
<P>
 The officer loved animals -- even to the point of recently bringing home a 
rabbit he rescued from a busy street, she said. He had planned to purchase 
Panzer, the part draft horse, part thoroughbred he rode on duty, when he left 
the mounted police squad. Charles Heim was worried that nobody else would be 
able to get along with the cantankerous animal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll remember his naivete. He was born and raised in the country, out in 
Acton," she said. "He was in awe of all the lights when he first came to work 
as an officer in the city. He was a happy person, doing the kind of work that 
he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Botello, who was visiting Beth Heim on Saturday afternoon, said the slain 
policeman's friends liked to tease him about the boots, cowboy-style shirts and 
jeans he inevitably wore when off duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd tell him to go change and he'd come back with a different color Western 
shirt," she said. "You could call him a country bumpkin and he'd just laugh. He 
loved to sing country karaoke songs like 'Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up 
to Be Cowboys' and embarrass the heck out of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The officer was a skilled mechanic. In his garage was a 1969 Chevelle that he 
was restoring. Next-door neighbor Craig Washington said Heim was generous about 
helping others with car projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you didn't know what Chuck did for a living, you'd never know he was a 
police officer," said Washington, a heavy equipment operator. "He was real 
people. He was fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Police Department, colleagues fondly remembered their dead 
associate as an outstanding officer who had yearned to work in the LAPD's 
mounted unit from the day he first heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no finer officer," said Lt. Mike Hillman of the Metropolitan 
Division. "This man has been revered by all of his peers." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith recalled the first time he met Heim, a barrel-chested hulk of a man 
whose military bearing reflected his service in the Army. It was at a roll call 
in the Hollywood Division just over five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "After roll call, this beaming face came up and said, 'Oh, man, I just have to 
do this,' " the sergeant said. "He looked like a kid who'd just heard about 
Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 Few crises tested the mounted unit, or the Police Department, more severely 
than the riots that erupted after four Los Angeles police officers were found 
not guilty in connection with the beating of Rodney G. King. The slain 
officer's colleagues said they relied on him in those frightening and sleepless 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went days without rest," Smith said. "One of the things that kept the unit 
going was Chuck. He just hammered out one-liners, one after the other. It got 
so that people were just waiting on the next one." 
</P>
<P>
 For all his humor, few things gave Heim deeper satisfaction than the solemn 
role he played in marking the deaths of fellow police officers. Starting just 
over five years ago, Smith resolved to introduce a riderless horse into the 
police funeral services -- empty boots facing backward in the stirrups signify 
the missing officer in military fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Controlling that horse is a difficult task, however. It carries only a light 
halter, and the services almost always draw hundreds of mourners, cameras, and 
sometimes helicopters. All of that is distracting to the animal, and Smith said 
it takes a special horse handler to perform the duty well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to find somebody to handle that," Smith said. "Then one day I was 
talking to Chuck about it. And there he was: tall, staunch, with a military 
background. He just clicked." 
</P>
<P>
 Heim's parents, Paula and James Heim of Santa Clarita, said their son had 
wanted to become a police officer ever since earning praise as a hero for 
catching a thief during his senior year at Canyon High School in Canyon 
Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Noticing someone breaking into an office complex early one morning, the 
17-year-old chased the intruder down and held him until sheriff's deputies 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Heim was awarded a commendation from the Sheriff's Department, and his exploit 
was described in the local newspaper, the Newhall Signal, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his son's devotion to the mounted unit, he wanted to return to patrol, 
James Heim said. He had started his new duties even before his transfer took 
effect Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he wanted to get back where the action was," his father said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the black-and-white before he got his transfer. I wish he'd 
stayed."

 Ana Ivanovich reached into her sewing basket and pulled out a pair of red wool 
slippers buried beneath a bundle of unfinished knitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are for you," she told a friend, her eyes welling with tears. "You'll 
need them when it gets colder." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanovich is leaving Sarajevo. She is one of countless exhausted and fed-up 
residents unable to bear the thought of another winter at war. Her hands are 
swollen from hauling jugs of water and stacks of firewood to her hillside 
apartment near the Zetra stadium, site of the 1984 Olympic ice skating 
competition. She complains of nightmares and torturous bouts of depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only knit now for those I love," the 53-year-old preschool teacher said as 
she stroked the beginnings of a sweater she stopped knitting a year ago. "I 
just don't have any interest anymore. I am tired. Tired of waiting for 
something to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Food in Sarajevo is more plentiful, utilities more regular and streets more 
tranquil now than in winters past. But the people of this besieged city are 
finding it difficult to muster the will to carry on. Sadly, modest improvements 
in everyday life, such as occasional running water and electricity, have become 
a source of anguish themselves -- a painful reminder of how dismal the routine 
in this once-thriving city has become. 
</P>
<P>
 "This war is lasting too long. Everyone thought it would be over by now," said 
Bakir Arnautovic, a young father who works at a downtown food pantry, one of 
about 100 set up by the Bosnian government to distribute humanitarian relief. 
"People are burning their cupboards and closets to stay warm. We are a proud 
people, but we can't take this forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevans have long felt abandoned by the world in their struggle to ward off 
the Bosnian Serb siege of their city -- now in its 30th month. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents and relief officials say the sense of helplessness and 
hopelessness has never been greater as the population hunkers down for a third 
winter at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me for advice, and I say, 'Get out of here,' " said Kris Janowski 
of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which provides 200 
tons of humanitarian relief to the city each day. "What little dignity was left 
here has been taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 But getting out is not easy. The Bosnian army needs soldiers to fight the war, 
and the Bosnian government needs civilians to broker peace. Without the 340,000 
people trapped here, the Bosnian Serb stranglehold on Sarajevo would command 
less international sympathy, most likely putting the outgunned Muslim-led 
Bosnian forces in further peril. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bosnian government does not want people getting out. That is a fact," a 
U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents fortunate enough to win permission to leave speak in hushed tones of 
their plans, fearful that talk of their pending departure may somehow 
jeopardize it. Ivanovich has told only her closest friends, some of whom have 
kept their own plans to themselves. Last month, one friend left unannounced 
just a day after the two women met for an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "A ticket out is the hottest commodity in town," Janowski said. "I don't know 
anybody who wouldn't want to leave if they could." 
</P>
<P>
 It took Ivanovich almost a year to collect the necessary papers, which include 
a passport, authorization from the Bosnian military, a transit visa to cross 
neighboring Croatia and permission to use a heavily fortified tunnel near the 
airport that feeds into friendly territory outside town. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the proper documents, the route is so precarious that trips are 
organized on short notice, only to be canceled at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanovich has been left stranded several times and now keeps a bag near the 
front door packed with clothes and family photos. The trip out of Sarajevo will 
cost her about $100, a huge sum she can afford only because her son, a truck 
driver in Germany, has sent her the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will worry about my mother," the widow said, gesturing toward an elderly 
woman huddled in front of a gas stove in the next room. "I've tried to talk her 
into coming too, but she won't leave. But I won't miss anything else about 
Sarajevo." 
</P>
<P>
 Times have been tough -- even tougher -- before. But residents say the city 
has lost much of the solidarity and camaraderie that carried it through past 
ordeals. The hope and optimism of last spring, when agreements were struck to 
end two years of intense shelling of the city, have given way to desperation 
and disappointment as Bosnian Serb snipers continue to terrorize residents, 
shoot at relief airplanes and threaten to throw out U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, snipers killed one man and wounded 11 others, including 
several children, when they opened fire on a streetcar traveling on the city's 
major thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Bosnian Serb forces shelled the city, killing two people and 
wounding 18, in response to a Bosnian government front-line assault outside 
Sarajevo. Day after day, gas and electricity supplies, both controlled by the 
Bosnian Serbs, serve as bargaining chips in the high-stakes military standoff, 
going on and off as relations warm and cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, such hardships served to unify the beleaguered population; now 
they mostly reinforce the despair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just trying to survive, to get by the best we can," said Dzana Kapa, a 
22-year-old college student who works as a translator for the U.N. Protection 
Force, which has 5,000 peacekeepers in the city. "People don't have the luxury 
to worry about anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the plunge in civic spirit was inevitable, some say, because the 
population of Sarajevo has changed dramatically in just two years. At least 
100,000 residents have fled the city since the start of the war, replaced by 
tens of thousands of refugees from other parts of Bosnia that are now under 
Serbian rebel control. Some native Sarajevans say they barely recognize their 
own neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hasan Karacic, a retired auto mechanic who was forced from his home near 
Sarajevo's airport at the start of the war, said the change in attitude cannot 
be blamed only on uncaring newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Karacic was digging a hillside vegetable patch with a hammer and small ax last 
week outside his tiny apartment, which he and his wife moved into two months 
ago after two years of searching for a new home. None of Karacic's neighbors -- 
several of whom had planted gardens on the same hillside -- would lend him 
gardening tools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody cares about you anymore," he said as he struggled to hollow a trench 
for spinach and onion seeds. "I just don't feel the friendship I used to feel. 
When you walk down the street and see someone you know, they just pass by. At 
the beginning of the war, everyone was helping each other. It is not the same 
city anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Karacic stood beneath a towering birch tree, which he had already sized up as 
possible firewood this winter. He and his wife live on a $1-a-month pension, 
U.N.-supplied flour, sugar and oil, and scraps of food she brings home from an 
unpaid job at the hospital across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 There certainly will be no money for firewood this winter, Karacic said, but 
he held out little hope of burning the birch tree to keep warm. His ax is too 
small to fell the tree, he explained, and he won't even bother asking anyone to 
lend him a larger one.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON TAKES POLICY GAMBLE WITH SYRIA VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton faces a serious foreign policy risk in his decision to visit 
Syria, a country linked with some of the deadliest acts of terrorism ever 
undertaken against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has calculated that the visit will pay off in pushing forward 
the Middle East peace process. But the regime of President Hafez Assad is 
unlikely to reciprocate with the kind of dramatic concession needed to prove 
the risk was worth taking, senior U.S. officials acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Clinton Administration may come away looking like it is 
endorsing one of the Middle East's most brutal regimes -- and regretting the 
precedent of visiting a country officially listed as a sponsor of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 Damascus has eased its stance on negotiating with Israel, which has broached 
the possibility of giving up the strategically valuable Golan Heights in return 
for peace with its longtime enemy. But Syria remains a one-party state with a 
ruthless leader who slaughtered up to 25,000 of his own people during a 1982 
uprising in Hama. Assad also allegedly supported the groups held responsible 
for the 1983-84 suicide bombings of two American embassies and U.S. Marine 
headquarters in Lebanon. The blasts killed more than 300 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Policy analysts say Clinton's visit may leave the wrong impression. "A visit 
to a home capital is quite a huge concession. Presidents don't go to other 
capitals to criticize. They go to endorse or show respect," said Robert 
Satloff, director of the Washington Institute on Near-East Policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the merits of this trip need to be measured by the potential for gain as 
well as risk. And the gains could be considerable in achieving a clear change 
in Syrian behavior on issues such as terrorism or winning from Assad a clear 
statement of his vision of peace with Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 But some interested parties were angered by the news. In a letter faxed to the 
White House, a woman whose 20-year-old daughter died at the hands of terrorists 
said she was outraged by Clinton's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may say that you are seeking peace, but you are in fact rewarding 
terrorism with such a meeting," said Susan Cohen, whose daughter, Theodora, 
died in the 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, 
Scotland. Syria and Iran were initially believed to be linked to the bombing, 
but subsequent evidence led to the indictments of two Libyans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assad has never renounced terrorism, and a half-dozen of the most notorious 
terrorist organizations in the world operate under his protection in Syria and 
Syrian-controlled Lebanon," Cohen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged such concerns Friday, admitting that the issue of Syria's 
relationship with terrorists had been the subject of much debate among 
advisers. Yet despite the risks, Administration officials and foreign policy 
experts on Saturday described the decision as sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department's annual "Patterns of Global Terrorism" lists Syria as 
one of seven nations that sponsor terrorism, a distinction it has held since 
the list was first published in 1979. The others are Libya, Iraq, Iran, North 
Korea, Cuba and Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it says there is no evidence that Syrian officials have been directly 
involved in planning or executing terrorist attacks since 1986, the State 
Department report says several radical terrorists maintain training camps or 
other facilities in Syria or Syrian-controlled Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 Among these groups are the notorious Abu Nidal group, Ahmed Jibril's Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command and Islamic Jihad -- all 
of which are opposed to the Middle East peace process. Others include the 
Japanese Red Army and anti-Turkey Kurdish groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The report notes, however, that Syria has taken steps to restrain the 
international activities of some groups. In July, 1993, Damascus helped cool 
escalating tensions between Lebanon and Israel by inducing Hezbollah militants 
to end rocket attacks on the northern Galilee region. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Lebanese militants fired five volleys of rockets into Israel. A 
State Department official said Saturday that the United States "tries not to 
draw conclusions from a single act. We look at a pattern of behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expected that Syria would keep Hezbollah from making such attacks, but we 
don't want to go overboard in interpreting one attack," the official said. 
"Most of the incidents along the border this year have been small and 
isolated." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Middle East specialists said Saturday that the best way to deal with 
Assad on terrorism issues is through direct engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 "History suggests that we do better when we talk to Assad and work with him 
rather than when we try to ignore him or let him stew," said Richard Haass, a 
George Bush Administration Middle East strategist who is now with the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush Administration invested considerable time in communicating and 
meeting with Assad, with two major payoffs, Haass said. Assad joined the 
U.S.-led Persian Gulf War coalition, and he went to the 1991 conference in 
Madrid that inaugurated the current peace effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy is a sharp contrast with that of 10 years ago, when the Ronald 
Reagan Administration tried to cut Assad out of diplomacy, and the Syrian 
leader turned around and helped sabotage a May, 1983, agreement -- mediated by 
the United States -- on Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that he's on the terrorism list should not get in the way of trying 
to work with him on the peace process for two reasons," Haass said. "First, 
foreign policy is about priorities. I would argue right now the priority is to 
bring peace to the region. Second, the best way to get Syria to cooperate on 
terrorism is to bring them more deeply into the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Syria is still a long way from getting its name removed from the U.S. 
terrorism list -- or reaping the resulting rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. law mandates that an Administration has to certify two things before a 
country can clear away its terrorism status, according to the State 
Department's counterterrorism office. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the country must refrain from terrorism or support of terrorism for at 
least six months. That includes refusing to grant logistic, financial and 
political support and refusing haven, aid or comfort to terrorist 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the country has to give "credible assurances" that it will no longer 
engage in terrorism or support of terrorism. The White House then makes a 
determination when it is satisfied with the assurances and notifies Congress 45 
days before the country is to be taken off the list. Once its name is removed, 
sanctions on arms sales are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Congress cannot stop a country from getting off the list, both houses 
can pass a joint "resolution of disapproval," which would block any new arms 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria is unlikely to be taken off the list before the new "Patterns of Global 
Terrorism" is published by the State Department in April.

COLUMN ONE; COURTS TOSS CURVEBALLS TO '3 STRIKES'; TIMES STUDY FINDS ONLY 1 IN 
6 ELIGIBLE DEFENDANTS GETS 25 YEARS TO LIFE AS JUDGES, PROSECUTORS EASE 
SENTENCING. BUT MANY GET LONGER TERMS THAN THEY WOULD HAVE PREVIOUSLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN and TED ROHRLICH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County judges and prosecutors have considerably softened the blow 
of California's new "three strikes" law, sending only 1 in 6 eligible 
defendants to prison for the 25 years to life prescribed for three-time losers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the six months since the law was enacted, in fact, defendants in cases 
involving third strikes were just as likely to be sentenced to a year in jail 
as they were to be put away for life, a study by The Times found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reviewed all 98 third-strike cases that were resolved between March, 
when the law took effect, and Aug. 31. Defendants in most of these cases were 
shoplifters and drug abusers. Fewer than one in five were accused of crimes of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most defendants were spared life sentences, many received longer 
terms than they would have before "three strikes" because the threat of life 
terms gave prosecutors more leverage to negotiate tougher plea bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a man who stole diapers from a supermarket was sentenced to eight 
years in prison, and another was sent away for eight years for possession of a 
rock of cocaine and a bag of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding whether repeat offenders should get life, a year in jail, or 
something in between can be a wrenching experience for judges and prosecutors. 
"When talking about a person's life, there's no such thing as an easy 
decision," said Philip H. Wynn, head deputy district attorney in the Van Nuys 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 crimes that are felonies under California law, ranging from 
placing a bet in an office pool to murder, can constitute a third strike under 
the law if an offender has been previously convicted of two or more serious or 
violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The law makes no distinction between offenses. As a result, many judges and 
some prosecutors have tried to draw their own lines. Some have differentiated 
between violent and nonviolent crimes, while others have given special 
consideration to defendants whose most serious offense was far behind them, The 
Times found. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Judge Carol J. Fieldhouse, a key member of the Los Angeles County 
Superior Court's special committee to study the impact of "three strikes," said 
that although violent criminals deserve to be sent away for life, people he 
considers to be "nuisances" do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refuse to dispense injustice," Fieldhouse said, adding that judges must 
find ways to "outwit" the law. "I wasn't put here to annihilate people because 
some politically hungry morons wanted (me) to." 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" law signed by Gov. Pete Wilson in March was intended to 
toughen sentencing of repeat offenders by limiting the discretion of judges and 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, which voters will be asked to reaffirm on the Nov. 8 ballot in 
the form of Proposition 184, criminals with one prior conviction for serious or 
violent crimes are supposed to be sentenced to double the usual term. Criminals 
with two or more such "strikes" who commit any new felony are subject to a 
prison term of triple the usual amount of time or 25 years to life, whichever 
is greater. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, however, also preserves some discretion for prosecutors by giving 
them the authority to ignore a defendant's past strike in the "furtherance of 
justice." Judges were not explicitly given that authority. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times analysis of the 98 resolved third-strike cases found that although 
some felons are getting longer prison terms, judges and prosecutors have 
exercised their powers to moderate the impact of the new law. In court and in 
interviews, they emphasized their obligation to act in the interest of justice 
within the constraints of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to bend over backward to be fair to community, the intent of 
legislation, the spirit of the law and, at the same time, be fair to the person 
charged with the crime," said Wynn of the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said in an interview that some of his prosecutors 
find it traumatic to seek a life sentence for a minor offense, even if a 
defendant's criminal history is serious. But, he said, prosecutors have to 
adjust their "mind set" to the community's growing impatience with business as 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
 What prosecutors "feel is justice may be at odds with what the community wants 
or expects in terms of justice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of the "three strikes" law, Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno), 
indicated that he was not surprised by The Times' findings. Acknowledging that 
district attorneys and judges retain considerable discretion, he said he never 
expected that everyone who was eligible would get life terms. But he said he 
believes the law is effective as a deterrent by telling would-be three-time 
losers: "Stop committing felonies in California." 
</P>
<P>
 In the cases examined by The Times, judges and prosecutors largely agreed on 
how to handle more serious offenses, such as residential burglary, robbery or 
rape. But judges concluded that prosecutors did not show enough defendants the 
compassion they deserved. In those cases, judges acted on their own to reduce 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy district attorneys gave breaks to 25 defendants, while judges took 
action that benefited 27 more. In cases in which prosecutors ignored a strike, 
the average prison term was five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some judges claimed pre-existing law gave them the power to ignore a past 
strike even though "three strikes" did not. More commonly, they used their well 
established authority to reduce certain felonies to misdemeanors, which are 
punishable by no more than a year in jail. In cases in which judges intervened, 
defendants went away for an average of 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen of the 97 defendants were sentenced to life and another is awaiting 
imposition of a life term. Thirty-one others had their cases dropped or settled 
because the prosecution did not have enough evidence against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said he has been told by his staff that they are exercising their 
discretion to ignore strikes in fewer than 10% of all third-strike cases. He 
said the Times study overstated his office's willingness to ignore strikes by 
looking only at resolved cases, and not the more than 800 third-strike cases 
filed in the same period that are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he was troubled by the inconsistencies in sentences documented 
by The Times, but blamed them on judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should one person get a one-year county jail sentence and the other get, 
in essence, a life sentence?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, those who received the maximum sentence had committed more serious 
offenses as their third strike. They had burglarized a residence while a 
terrified homeowner watched, held up a gas station armed with a pellet gun or 
sodomized a cellmate at knifepoint. 
</P>
<P>
 But their ranks also included people who stole a bicycle, sold a single rock 
of cocaine to an undercover police officer or were seen by police in a parked 
stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal history of those who got life and those who received lighter 
sentences appeared similar. Most were thieves with drug habits, according to 
probation reports and criminal histories, and most had been convicted in the 
past of at least one crime of violence, such as robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 At an average age of 35, they were a decade older than the age at which 
experts figure the average criminal is most active. Most were unemployed and 
many were homeless, such as John B. Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 One hot day in July, Fernandez -- still on parole after a 1982 armed-robbery 
conviction -- plucked two 40-ounce bottles of beer from a cooler in a San 
Fernando liquor store and told the clerk to call police; he'd be drinking the 
beer outside. Fernandez later told police he wanted to go back to prison 
because "he was hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the nature of Fernandez's offense, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Vezzani 
chose to ignore a strike -- a 1981 robbery conviction. In turn, Fernandez 
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison, a 
more severe penalty than he would likely have received prior to "three 
strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Vezzani wrote in the case file that he asked his superiors for permission to 
handle the case as a misdemeanor, but was denied. He complained that such 
decisions will cause the system to be flooded with trivial cases. "This is a 
classic example of why the law is doomed to destruction -- the sooner the 
better," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the district attorney's office, there are conflicting views as to how 
the law should be applied. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of his colleagues, Dist. Atty. Garcetti favors a version of "three 
strikes" that would target only serious or violent offenders with life terms. 
But he has directed his deputies in written memos to enforce the law fully and 
to use their discretion to cut deals only in "rare" cases. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting in August, supervisors from the branch offices were split over 
whether that policy was just. Some said their scruples demanded that they be 
given greater discretion to ignore prior strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Denis K. Petty, the head prosecutor in Torrance, said he told Garcetti that he 
intended to follow his own conscience in deciding when it was appropriate to 
seek life sentences on a third strike. According to him and others who attended 
the meeting, Garcetti said nothing. Petty said he took that to be tacit 
approval of his position, and said he has since shown mercy to more three-time 
losers than any of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Isaac Peoples is a case in point. Petty said he could not bring himself 
to "put a guy away for 25 to life for stealing underwear." So Petty ignored one 
strike and Peoples pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Other supervisors have said they feel obligated to follow Garcetti's written 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's fair, but it's the law, and I have a duty to enforce the 
law," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth C. Wullschleger, a supervisor in the 
Downtown criminal courts building. He said he has sought life sentences against 
drug users even though he personally believes the punishment to be unjust. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges have criticized the district attorney's office for failing to exercise 
discretion more often. Many have tried to make deals on their own, over the 
D.A.'s objection and despite the fact that the law does not empower them to 
ignore a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Superior Court Judge Arthur Jean decided to intervene in the case 
of Calvin Bailey, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who had been convicted in 1986 of two robberies, faced life 
imprisonment for walking out of K Mart with $225 worth of merchandise that 
included toothpaste, razors, a camera and a pair of jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean decided to ignore one of Bailey's strikes and sentence him to seven years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a basic shoplifting situation, to commit somebody to prison for life 
appears to me to be foolish, foolish and unfair -- terribly, terribly unfair 
and wrong," Jean said in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have appealed his decision, arguing that only they have the power 
to ignore a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the appellate courts will make me do these things," Jean said from the 
bench. "I hope not. I hope to God not." 
</P>
<P>
 Many predict that pressure will grow to make deals. With "three strikes" still 
in its infancy, much of the debate within the judiciary and the district 
attorney's office has focused on issues of fairness and justice. But, with 
time, more practical concerns may dominate the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of August, 800 cases involving a third strike remained unresolved. 
Most of those cases will go to trial unless prosecutors and judges cut deals. 
If they don't, there will be a shortage of courtrooms, judges, public defenders 
and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The math is simple but powerful: Prior to "three strikes," an overburdened 
court system resolved its caseload because district attorneys and judges used 
plea bargains to settle nine of every 10 felony cases before trials. A "three 
strikes" defendant facing 25 years to life is unlikely to plead guilty unless 
someone offers him a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "A huge wave (of trials) is building and building and building," said Los 
Angeles County Public Defender Michael P. Judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, criminal cases are trickling into civil courtrooms. One judge 
reported that he has interrupted civil trials -- sending home plaintiffs, 
defendants and witnesses -- to make room for criminal defendants who are 
entitled to speedy trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the system reaches the point where it is bulging and exploding, which it 
will . . . I think D.A.s will exercise more discretion," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Peter Berman, a supervisor in the Downtown criminal courts building. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, however, said he has no intention of giving his deputies greater 
leeway to settle cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect there will be more judges who will feel the pressure of the number 
of cases that the criminal system has to deal with and start exercising their 
discretion," he said, promising to fight those who intervene too often. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, judges and district attorneys are searching for standards of 
fairness to apply to the myriad cases they handle daily. The six cases detailed 
here illustrate the variety of solutions that have emerged from that collective 
search. The Rapist 
</P>
<P>
 While many prosecutors and judges wrestle with their consciences over sending 
shoplifters and drug abusers to prison for life, none expressed such concerns 
for Hilton Booker. 
</P>
<P>
 Booker, 37, began getting in trouble as a teen-ager when he was convicted of 
robberies, burglaries and drug possession. Over the next two decades, the 
criminal justice system was a revolving door that repeatedly put him back on 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Without fail, Booker would be arrested within months of his release from 
prison -- for robbery, stealing a car, shooting at a house or fighting, 
according to probation records. He accrued 10 aliases and came to be known in 
prison as "Prince." 
</P>
<P>
 A month after his release in June, 1993, Booker was arrested for the rape of a 
prostitute in Lancaster. While serving a prison sentence in that case, he and a 
partner beat up and repeatedly raped a fellow cellmate at knifepoint. 
</P>
<P>
 A sentencing report prepared by the Probation Department said Booker "could 
easily fit the description of the type of convict the community has been 
talking about who should probably spend, if not the rest of his life, at least 
25 years (in prison)." 
</P>
<P>
 Booker was sentenced in August to 42 years to life by a judge who piled on 
extra penalties. The Shoplifter 
</P>
<P>
 Terrence J. Carello had been shoplifting meals three or four times a day from 
his neighborhood Lucky's in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot, 5-inch Carello had more than one conversation with the store's 
much-smaller security guard about his habit of not paying for food. He informed 
the guard that he planned to continue stealing food for his family. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, however, a police officer happened by soon after one of Carello's 
visits and caught him with pilfered pancake mix, syrup, sausages and Kool-Aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Carello had racked up six shoplifting convictions during one three-year period 
in the early 1980s. As a teen-ager and young adult, he had committed a robbery 
and a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he faced 25 years to life until Patricia Ryan, who heads the 
district attorney's Long Beach office, agreed to ignore one of the previous 
offenses. She said she was willing to accept less than life in prison because 
Carello had not been violent or even threatening in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Carello will go to state prison for more than 10 years. Prior to "three 
strikes," the offense probably would have gotten him no more than a few months 
in jail. The Drug Abuser 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Allen Lyon had been arrested for jaywalking. Then the deputy who 
stopped him found he was carrying enough methamphetamine to get him high, or 
send him to prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon, 39, had been in and out of jails and prisons for 20 years on drug and 
theft charges related to his almost daily use of marijuana, heroin, cocaine and 
speed, according to a probation report. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of his thefts -- a robbery and residential burglary he had committed 12 
years ago -- were classified as "serious," and the charge of drug possession 
was his third strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Superior Court Judge Dino Fulgoni thought a life sentence in Lyon's 
case was inappropriate. Such a penalty would have been an "unconscionable way 
to treat the defendant, who is a pathetic drug addict, and an unconscionable 
way to treat the people of California, because they need the prison space for 
people who are more violent, currently, than he is," Fulgoni said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this guy belongs in prison; don't get me wrong," Fulgoni said. "But 
he comes far from belonging in prison for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulgoni said he does not believe he has the authority to ignore a strike. So 
he exercised another option: He reduced Lyon's drug charge to a misdemeanor. 
Misdemeanors, by definition, carry a penalty of no more than a year in jail. 
That's what Lyon got. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the cooperation of the D.A., the statute gives me the option of 
putting him in jail for a year for a misdemeanor or committing the injustice of 
putting him in jail for life," Fulgoni said. The Diaper Thief 
</P>
<P>
 The case against Rudy Roman Rodriguez was simple. "He told officers that he 
had been drinking a little, he remembered that he needed some diapers at home, 
so he went and took some," a probation officer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 31, who had been convicted of robberies in 1982 and 1990, was 
caught this time shoplifting a $29.99 pack of Huggies from a Downey 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk Superior Court Judge Robert W. Armstrong, who could not see sentencing 
Rodriguez to life, maneuvered prosecutors into a compromise by threatening to 
reduce the charge to a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors agreed to ignore a strike, which allowed Armstrong to sentence 
Rodriguez to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were not willing to back down on this . . . I would have taken it 
into my own hands and he'd have gotten a year," the judge said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong said he felt it was his "obligation to temper justice with mercy. . 
. . I'm not going to be cowed by politicians who I think are pandering to the 
public to take advantage of the public's fear of crime." The Abusive Boyfriend 
</P>
<P>
 In Christopher Renault Kinsey, prosecutors had a chance to lock away forever 
someone they thought was a menace. But they also had a problem: a weak case. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsey, 30, was accused of attacking his live-in girlfriend days before she 
was to give birth to their second child. But the victim wasn't willing to 
cooperate, even though Kinsey had served prison time for assaulting her while 
she was pregnant with their first child. 
</P>
<P>
 With their key witness shaky, prosecutors offered Kinsey six years in return 
for a guilty plea. He wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsey decided to try his luck with a jury. If his gamble failed, he would 
almost certainly face life because of his long, violent record. He had been 
convicted of two attempted robberies at ATM machines and the robbery of a woman 
pushing a baby stroller. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Mitchell Bruckner, Kinsey 
changed his mind 15 minutes into jury selection, but the prosecutor told him 
that her supervisor said the deal was no longer on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You're 15 minutes too late,' " Bruckner recalled the prosecutor telling 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Meredith Rust, remembered it somewhat 
differently. It was more like two hours, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsey was convicted and sentenced to 29 years to life. The Tire Thief 
</P>
<P>
 Girmai Gabremahdin, 27, was headed for life in prison until Long Beach Judge 
William T. Garner stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 During a monthlong, cocaine-driven crime spree that began in December, 1986, 
Gabremahdin was a notorious "bump and run" bandit in Santa Monica. He pleaded 
guilty to robbing 21 women, most of them lone motorists whose cars he had 
intentionally hit so he could grab their purses. 
</P>
<P>
 He served four years of an eight-year sentence, then stayed out of big trouble 
until 2 a.m. one rainy night last March, a week after the "three strikes" law 
became effective. Gabremahdin's car got a flat tire and he didn't have a spare. 
</P>
<P>
 He was caught taking one from a Wilmington junkyard; a jury convicted him of 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner acknowledged Gabremahdin's violent criminal past but refused to 
sentence him to life. Instead, he sentenced him to a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a misdemeanor," Garner said. "It should have been prosecuted as a 
misdemeanor." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Dolores (Dee) Turner, who prosecuted the case, called 
Garner's decision outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever we think about the statute, the Legislature clearly intended this 
guy when they passed it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT: Parolees slip through a loophole in the law. Legal Paths 
</P>
<P>
 California's "three strikes" law was intended to toughen sentencing of repeat 
offenders by reducing the discretion of judges and prosecutors. In the six 
months since the law was enacted, however, judges and prosecutors have 
frequently reduced the penalty that can be imposed on "three strikes" 
defendants. The law, which calls for 25-years-to-life prison terms for anyone 
with two prior "serious" felony convictions, gives prosecutors power to seek 
lesser penalties in the "furtherance of justice." Judges also have claimed 
similar power or found other ways to give defendants a break. Such discretion 
can be exercised at various points in the court system. 
</P>
<P>
 CASE FILING: A prosecutor decides whether a crime qualifies as a third strike. 
If the case is filed as a felony, a preliminary hearing is held in Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 LEGAL OPTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Misdemeanor charge: Prosecutors can charge some crimes, such as shoplifting as 
felonies or misdemeanors. If filed as a misdemeanor, the case drops out of the 
"strikes" pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 PRELIMINARY HEARING: The Municipal Court can send the case along to Superior 
Court for trial or dismiss it. 
</P>
<P>
 LEGAL OPTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Misdemeanor charge: The judge has authority to decide that a felony third 
strike is really a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 PRETRIAL HEARING: Superior Court judges rule on motions and see if cases can 
be settled. 
</P>
<P>
 LEGAL OPTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor plea bargain: Under "three strikes," a prosecutor can ignore a 
prior strike "in the furtherance of justice" and negotiate a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 LEGAL OPTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Judge plea bargain: Some judges also are stepping in to strike deals. Some are 
relying on another statute that gives them general power to act in the 
interests of justice and ignore a strike; others are using their power to 
reduce felonies to misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 TRIAL: Defendants face a judge or jury. If convicted they face 25 years to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 LEGAL OPTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Intervenes: Even after convictions, some judges are ignoring prior 
strikes or reducing charges to misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 CASE SNAPSHOTS 
</P>
<P>

Hollywood on March 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal history: Robbery in 1987 and residential burglary in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Outcome: Over district attorney's objection, Municipal Court Judge Isabel 
Cohen reduced the felony charge to a misdemeanor. She sentenced Crowell to 180 
days in jail. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The number of "third strike" cases filed has grown steadily since the law took 
effect March 7. Ordinarily, most of the cases would have been settled already 
through plea bargains. However, more than 800 remained unresolved because 
defendants have no incentive to plead guilty to charges that carry life prison 
terms.

CLINTON SIGNS RULE ON GUNS IN SCHOOLS; POLITICS: PRESIDENT VISITS BAY AREA TO 
STUMP FOR FEINSTEIN AND BROWN. HIS DIRECTIVE WILL HELP ENFORCE A LAW THAT CALLS 
FOR EXPULSIONS OF STUDENTS WHO BRING FIREARMS ONTO CAMPUSES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton made his first California visit of the campaign season 
Saturday to boast of new federal action against school violence and to help 
embattled Sen. Dianne Feinstein and gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown amid 
the state's richest concentration of Democratic loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first trip to the state since May, Clinton joined Feinstein at 
gang-troubled Carlmont High School in this San Mateo County town and signed an 
order that requires a halt in federal school aid to districts that do not expel 
students who bring guns to school. The directive will help enforce a law, 
co-sponsored by Feinstein, that calls for the expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people simply should not have to live in fear of young criminals who 
carry guns to school," Clinton said to a exuberant crowd of 1,000 students, 
parents and teachers, as Feinstein sat nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's opponent, Rep. Mike Huffington, opposes the gun expulsion rule, 
saying it unnecessarily involves federal authority in local schools. He has 
made the senator's support of Clinton a major campaign issue and had already 
criticized Saturday's planned joint appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The school gathering was put together by Feinstein and Clinton aides as a sort 
of political surgical strike, carefully calculated in subject, location and 
timing to make the most of the mixed blessings that Clinton can bestow this 
campaign season. 
</P>
<P>
 A $12.7-billion federal education aid bill signed Thursday by Clinton orders 
states to require expulsions of gun-carrying students. However, Administration 
officials feared that some school districts would drag their feet, so the 
directive was signed to specify a penalty for districts that fail to carry out 
those policies. 
</P>
<P>
 School violence is a topic with broad voter appeal, mingling the two top voter 
concerns of crime and education. By staging the event in the Bay Area, the 
White House hoped to reach the state's concentration of Democratic loyalists, 
while minimizing media coverage in more conservative areas of Southern 
California where an appearance with Clinton might be more of a negative. 
</P>
<P>
 In a midterm election year, turnout is crucial, and with Feinstein's lead in 
recent opinion polls running about 7%, it is essential for her to mobilize her 
Democratic base. 
</P>
<P>
 The school event was arranged only in the past week, and was not heavily 
publicized, making it likely that coverage would be largely confined to the Bay 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing was fortuitous for Feinstein because Clinton has recently seen a 
boost in his polls, after sliding downward amid setbacks in foreign policy and 
his domestic agenda. With an approval rating of 49%, according to a recent Los 
Angeles Times poll, Clinton is on a bounce -- and is more popular than any 
other statewide political figure, including Feinstein, White House officials 
note. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts argue that Huffington's criticism of Clinton's ties to Feinstein 
are by now so familiar that they would not be likely to win over many new 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strategy of this event was excellent," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a 
political analyst who works at the Claremont Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton appeared Saturday evening at a fund-raiser for gubernatorial candidate 
Kathleen Brown in San Francisco before leaving for campaigning in Washington 
state and Ohio. The Brown fund-raiser at the Fairmont was attended by 900 
people and raised $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Brown is running a come-from-behind race to wrest the 
governor's office from Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and she has openly welcomed 
any and all support from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Fairmont, the President denounced Wilson for helping create the illegal 
immigration problem that the governor now blames on the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your governor calls my (enforcement) effort pathetic -- he made the problem 
happen when he was in the Senate," Clinton said, referring to Wilson's 1986 
support of a federal initiative that allowed hundreds of thousands of 
immigrants into the country to help harvest crops. Critics have charged that 
the farm worker initiative accelerated the influx of immigrants to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilson returned to California as governor during the George Bush 
Administration, Clinton said, "he never issued a peep for more money, or a 
peep" for greater authority to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day at the school, Clinton signed a directive ordering the 
secretary of education to cut off federal funds for any school district that 
does not implement the federal law ordering expulsion of children who bring 
guns to class. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton emphasized Feinstein's contribution on the school violence bill, and 
on this year's legislation banning some makes of military-style assault 
weapons, which Feinstein sponsored. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein returned the compliment, noting that Clinton's visit after January's 
earthquake contrasted with President Bush's absence after the Loma Prieta 
quake. "After the Loma Prieta earthquake a President wasn't there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington opposes the expulsion rule, calling it another unjustified federal 
infringement on school questions that are properly a local matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is typical Feinstein mentality," Huffington said. "If somebody broke 
their toenail, she'd want the federal government involved. But the federal 
government cannot be in every classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's five-month absence from the state contrasts sharply with last year, 
when he visited California about every six weeks. Aides say the absence is 
because of the press of legislative business earlier this year, and a string of 
foreign trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has been shunned by Democratic candidates this season in many parts of 
the country because of his unpopularity. But the school appearance brought out 
two local members of Congress, Rep. Tom Santos and Rep. Anna Eshoo, as well as 
state Treasurer Brown and state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 With a handsomely maintained building and grounds, Carlmont High School looks 
like anything but a troubled inner-city school. But it draws students from 
middle-class and poorer communities, including East Palo Alto, and parents said 
their children have feared violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Several parents said they like Clinton's hard line on guns in schools, as well 
as the stiff disciplinary rules of the school's principal, Michael Johnson.

LOCAL LOYALTIES MAY SPARE DEMOCRATS FROM DISASTER; ELECTIONS: GOP HOPES FOR 
CONGRESSIONAL DOMINANCE COULD FOUNDER IN DISTRICTS WHERE VOTERS FAVOR 
FAMILIARITY.

<P>
 In this part of Rockingham County, a rural stretch of rolling hills and light 
industry that cozies up to the Virginia border, most folks know that the place 
for breakfast is Fuzzy's Pit B-B-Q. The gravy comes thick and light brown and 
the hush puppies are fried crisp. The only bad part these days is the 
likelihood of running into a politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, for instance, Gene Hopper was listening intently as Richard 
Burr, a clean-cut young Republican running for "the U.S. Congress," as Burr 
likes to call it, delivered his pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 As Burr, a former appliance salesman, moved on down the counter, Hopper said 
he had to admit that, on most issues, he tends to side with Republicans. He 
doesn't like President Clinton at all, thank you. And after protection for the 
tobacco business, the thing that concerns him most is the right to bear arms -- 
something he fears may be jeopardized by Democrats who talk about tougher gun 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Hopper was still leaning toward A.P. (Sandy) Sands, the local 
Democratic state senator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with Sandy, and he's just a good man," said Hopper, who sported a 
North Carolina Wildlife Officers Assn. cap that matched his camouflage hunter's 
vest. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he's even a little annoyed by Burr's radio ads, which liken Sands to 
Clinton and ask the provocative question: "Do we need any more Bill Clintons in 
Washington?" Hopper feels certain Sandy is nothing like Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be the South," Hopper said. "We may be dumb. We may have been born 
at night. But we weren't born last night." 
</P>
<P>
 Reactions like that are wondrous to the ears of Democratic strategists. It is 
precisely such local attachments that give them hope that their candidates can 
escape what appears to be a rising Republican tide. With the election slightly 
more than two weeks away, polls forecast a Republican landslide that could give 
the party control of the Senate for the first time since 1986 and the House for 
the first time since Dwight D. Eisenhower was President. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters like Hopper are key to the Democrats' hopes of holding on. 
</P>
<P>
 The races in which Republicans hope to do best are the so-called open seats -- 
districts in which the incumbent has decided not to run again. This year, there 
are 52 such seats in the House and nine in the Senate. Thirty-one of the open 
House seats belong to Democrats, and half of those are in Southern or Border 
states, where Clinton is particularly unwelcome. Six out of the nine open 
Senate seats are in Democratic hands. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, Republican candidates appear solidly ahead in three open-seat 
races -- Maine, Arizona and Ohio. Republican Spencer Abraham is deemed to be 
narrowly leading in Michigan. The contests for two other seats, Tennessee and 
Oklahoma, are much closer, and Democrats are hopeful they can hold onto the 
Oklahoma seat. Only one Republican open seat, in Minnesota, seems likely to 
switch over to the Democrats this year. The GOP is expected to hold on to the 
two other open seats, in Wyoming and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans need to pick up seven new seats to gain majority control of the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, where Republicans would need a whopping 40-seat gain to wrest 
control, the situation is far more complex. A look at four open-seat races -- 
two in North Carolina and one each in Texas and Florida -- helps explain why. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic strategy in these races is to sell the notion that all politics 
is local and that all races are a choice between two individuals. Conversely, 
the Republicans are trying to make this election a referendum on the Clinton 
Administration's policies and on the President's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in North Carolina, the only person more unpopular than Clinton, 
opinion surveys reveal, is his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But linking Democrats to Clinton may not automatically produce the sure-fire 
results Republicans are hoping for. In many districts the lines between parties 
are more blurred than they were a decade ago. Much more may depend on the 
characteristics of individual candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic tradition in North Carolina, for example, owes more to the late 
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. than anyone now living. "I don't even know what a Bill 
Clinton Democrat is," said Sands, a rural trial lawyer whose demeanor is a 
mixture of striking candor and Southern charm. "But it couldn't be any worse 
than running as a Mike Dukakis Democrat," and Sands survived that. 
</P>
<P>
 If candidates are difficult to stereotype, so are voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, the 25th Congressional District in and around Houston is a 
sprawling, C-shaped oddity that encompasses 100 miles of oil refineries, a 
largely white suburb around the Johnson Space Center, Rice University and a 
low-income, predominantly minority section of Harris County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrat is Ken Bentsen Jr., former Harris County Democratic chairman and 
nephew of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, a Democrat who has been considered 
as conservative as many Republicans. The Republican, Gene Fontenot, is a 
millionaire doctor associated with the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 At Louise's Cafe, a square cinder-block building near the oil refineries on 
Interstate 10, Douglas McKinney was making a breakfast of sausage, biscuits and 
gravy vanish in a hurry. "Baby, you're looking at a full-fledged Democrat," the 
60-year-old home remodeler said, echoing the sentiments of most of the diners 
gathered one morning last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican doctor running, he said, represents fat-cat millionaires and 
their precious tax breaks. "Democrats are more for the working man. Clinton's 
doing just fine. I'm voting for Bentsen, you can write that down." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Lang, a 45-year-old waitress, refilled McKinney's coffee cup without 
a word. A few minutes later, she put her hands on her hips as she stood behind 
the lunch counter. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can Democrats be for the working man when I have to work two jobs to make 
ends meet?" she asked. "I'm voting Republican because the Democrats are letting 
too many immigrants into the country who take our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, Democrats hope that Republicans have nominated candidates who 
are simply too far to the right for their districts. The Democrats are running 
"moderate conservatives" against the Republicans' "right-wing conservatives," 
argues Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento), the chairman of the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible case in point is Florida's 15th Congressional District, the site 
of the Kennedy Space Center, Patrick Air Force Base and the national training 
center for the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. Until several months ago, 
the Democratic candidate here actually was a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Retiring Democratic Rep. Jim Bacchus helped recruit Sue Munsey, 49, a former 
Republican and president of the Cocoa Beach Chamber of Commerce, to counter 
what many there see as the local Republican Party's move to the extreme right. 
She is being challenged by Palm Bay physician Dave Weldon, 41, who was one of 
the founders of the Space Coast Family Forum and has been associated with 
anti-abortion violence. 
</P>
<P>
 At a debate earlier this month, Weldon accused Munsey of not being a real 
Democrat. "The fact that you're sitting beside me is testimony to why I 
switched parties," she shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a model for the Democratic Party," said Linda Hennessee, the retiring 
congressman's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Burr-Sands race in North Carolina, the generalization breaks down. 
Democrats have a slight numerical advantage in the district, and Burr, a former 
Wake Forest University football star, is described as a moderate who doesn't 
talk about abortion and says health care reform is a major issue. (He has, 
however, signed the GOP "contract with America," a package that favors tax 
cuts, term limits and a balanced-budget amendment.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sands and Burr get high marks from the National Rifle Assn. Both are 
considered friends of the tobacco industry, which is key in a district that is 
home of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But as both candidates know, the decision-making process for voters is not 
necessarily driven by party ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fuzzy's, Gwen Hawkins, who works in public recreation in Rockingham County, 
says she decides who to vote for after meeting them and looking them in the 
eye. "It's always good to know your person in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Out here, politics is still retail -- a matter, for instance, of going to the 
debate between Sands and Burr or providing an audiotape for friends who 
couldn't attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Sandy got the best of the kid in that last one," offered a man 
sitting next to Hopper. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps this recent moment best captures the nature of politics here: 
</P>
<P>
 Standing outside his fourth Food Lion store of the day, Burr stuck his palm 
out for perhaps the 500th time and introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Larry Sands," the voter answered. "You're running against my brother." 
</P>
<P>

CSUN HOLDS PROMISE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS; EDUCATION: MANY SEEK A BETTER LIFE 
THROUGH COLLEGE. SOME FEAR THEIR SAFE HAVEN IS THREATENED BY PROP. 187. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge sophomore Vladimir Cerna is the sort of student high 
school counselors always remember -- a poor kid but bright, someone who gets 
into trouble early on, straightens out and makes it to college. 
</P>
<P>
 While his mom cleans houses and his stepfather works at the carwash, Cerna -- 
a student body senator -- studies to be a sociologist. Two days a week, he 
tutors junior high students in algebra and geometry. Between classes he works 
as a clerk in the school's business department. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, the 21-year-old Cerna embodies the American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also an illegal immigrant, living in the United States without 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, those two identities have not caused much conflict for Cerna. Nobody 
at Cal State Northridge -- or any of the other 19 California State University 
schools -- is asked to prove legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Cerna and other illegal immigrants enrolled at the Northridge campus 
worry their safe haven will be transformed into a government trap by 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, if passed, would restrict access to public education, health 
care and other government programs by illegal immigrants. It would also require 
school officials to report to authorities any students suspected of living in 
the U. S. illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of being deported, of being denied a chance at college, puts yet 
another obstacle in front of these students, most of them poor, who were 
brought to the U. S. as youngsters or teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here five years ago to escape the war in El Salvador," said Emilio 
Flores, 20, a CSUN junior and photography editor of the campus newspaper. "I 
didn't want to come. But here I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Proposition 187 say it is wrong for legal residents to subsidize 
lawbreakers. State officials estimate it costs taxpayers about $4,400 a year to 
school each of CSU's more than 320,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Prince, chairman of the pro-187 campaign, said the issue boils down to 
the law -- which sets a limit on the number of legal immigrants to the U. S. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not be destroyed by allowing people to come here illegally," Prince 
said. "We cannot allow our state to go bankrupt providing services. There is 
simply not enough money to go around." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the initiative argue the cost of denying education would be 
even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "Years ago I had a professor who would always say that even though he didn't 
have any children, he and his wife would vote for every education measure," 
said Jorge Garcia, dean of the school of humanities at CSUN. "Because no matter 
what it costs, it was cheaper than ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, CSU schools have been the fast track for undocumented students 
bright enough and ambitious enough to escape the low-wage drudgery endured by 
their immigrant parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although lawsuits are expected to delay or void portions of the initiative 
restricting education for kindergarten through 12th grade students, college 
education does not have the same constitutional protections in California. CSU 
officials say they can only wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how many CSU students are illegal immigrants. Estimates range 
from several hundred to several thousand. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of Cerna's friends know his status. Being an illegal immigrant is no badge 
of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 But like the other CSUN students interviewed for this story, Cerna asked that 
his real name be used. The decision to shed anonymity reflects the deep 
sentiment that Proposition 187 has aroused among those who did as they were 
told: rejecting gangs and drugs and welfare in favor of the historic and 
well-worn path to success in America. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cerna seems always on the run -- leaping to answer the telephone at his 
Northridge apartment, dashing to class or to another meeting. A friend, CSUN 
senior Liz Montanez, says Cerna keeps a wide circle of friends informed about 
campus politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the one who goes to meetings, so a lot of us get our information from 
him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerna began his scramble in the U. S. eight years ago, when he was 13. It was 
November and Cerna had graduated from the eighth grade, the last mandatory year 
of school in El Salvador. He was looking forward to entering a secondary 
school, but his parents had other plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "My stepfather said, 'Pack your things, we are leaving Monday,' " said Cerna, 
who with his two brothers and sister endured a six-week journey that included 
10 days strapped to the top of freight trains through Mexico. "The trip was 
like going to hell and back." 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived on New Year's Day, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was total culture shock," Cerna said. "When I first stepped outside, I was 
thinking, 'Why are the streets so wide?' I started school three weeks later, in 
the sixth grade." 
</P>
<P>
 Cerna adapted to his new life, learning English -- as well as the temptations 
of the street -- while at Hollenbeck Junior High School. In the ninth grade, he 
and some buddies found a master key and used it to enter their school at night, 
to steal and vandalize. On their third trip, the authorities were waiting for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fined $350, got 120 hours of community service and was kicked out of 
the school district," Cerna said. "My parents were so disappointed, and I was 
so ashamed. . . . I started thinking, 'This is not going to take me anywhere,' 
especially when I would see my parents struggling to pay bills. I didn't want 
to end up like that." 
</P>
<P>
 So the following school year, Cerna enrolled at Roosevelt High School, using 
his mother's maiden name. And in the 10th grade, Helen Rodriguez became his 
guidance counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was behind on credits, had some missing grades and had that disciplinary 
problem at Hollenbeck," recalled Rodriguez, who has worked for 27 years for the 
Los Angeles Unified School District. "But I looked up his reading and math 
scores and found out he was very intelligent. He told me frankly what had 
happened and said that was in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 By 12th grade, Cerna was excelling in college preparatory classes, eventually 
graduating with honors and earning awards in English and math. He hopes now to 
someday earn a doctorate in sociology. His younger brother graduated from 
Roosevelt High and is preparing to follow Cerna to CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
 "If 187 passes, I'm not sure exactly how it will affect me," Cerna said. CSU 
officials say they believe that if the initiative passes, legal challenges will 
likely delay implementation, possibly for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "First I would try to work full time and pay as an international student," he 
said. "But I guess in the back of my mind I'm thinking I would go back to El 
Salvador and teach there. That would be difficult. With the new government, it 
is very unstable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of 187 say the initiative is a pocketbook issue, in addition to a 
legal one, a reaction against those looking for something from nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN senior Laura Godoy -- the oldest of 11 brothers and sisters -- says she 
has paid a steep price to live in the U. S. And now, though she has lived most 
of her 22 years in Los Angeles, she still has mixed feelings about the life, 
and the family, she left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to live with my grandmother when I was three or four," said 
Godoy, a Chicano studies major. "I think my mom and dad thought it would be 
best for me to keep my grandma company, and to learn the language and get a 
better education." 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of starting school in Guadalajara, Mexico, she enrolled at Glassell 
Park Elementary School. Over the years, it was her grandmother whom she called 
mom. And English quickly joined Spanish in her everyday speech. 
</P>
<P>
 She returned to her family's house in Mexico for junior high school at her 
parents' request. But by then she had become a stranger accustomed to a 
different life and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult to understand Spanish in school," Godoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, there were also problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised as an only child. I was an outsider to my brothers and sisters," 
she said. "My little brother, he was about 8, would say I was too bossy. He'd 
say, 'Why don't you go back where you came from?' " 
</P>
<P>
 During summers, she would return to live with her grandmother, who had been 
working in Los Angeles since the 1930s, cleaning houses and caring for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, at the end of the summer before 11th grade, Godoy decided to stay in 
Los Angeles. "I told my dad, 'I'm not leaving.' My grandmother told him, 'Her 
life is here,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time it was English that gave her trouble in school, since she had missed 
junior high grammar. But she did well enough at Franklin High School to be 
accepted at CSUN, leaving behind friends having babies or getting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her grandmother -- who had encouraged her to remain in the U. S. and go to 
college -- died during Godoy's freshman year, leaving her suddenly responsible 
for her own life and finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gained a lot of responsibility and independence, learning how to 
survive," Godoy said. "I'm not sorry I'm here. I will be the first in my family 
to graduate from college. My dad didn't finish junior high school. My mom 
didn't finish elementary school. . . . But those sibling memories, you know, 
'Remember how I kicked your butt when I was four?' I don't have that, and it 
hurts. But I think it's my destiny that I be here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Especially troubling, say opponents of Proposition 187, are its requirements 
that school workers, police, health care workers and others in traditional 
helping professions report suspected illegal immigrants to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 That far-reaching provision would "make informants out of all of us," said 
Rabbi Harold M. Schulweiss, leader of Valley Beth Shalom in Encino and an 
initiative opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, Latinos with brown skin and dark hair are suspect. GOP 
congressional candidate Richard Sybert, a 187 supporter, said in a recent 
interview that he can spot an illegal immigrant in a crowd using "logic, 
intuition and common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Emilio Flores said that kind of thinking frustrates and frightens him. 
</P>
<P>
 "These stupid stereotypes about illegal immigrants, they think they are all 
these people who take social services or they are the guys selling oranges at 
the freeway on-ramps," said Flores, who was sent to Los Angeles from El 
Salvador by his father on a tourist visa, now long expired. 
</P>
<P>
 He enrolled at University High School after arriving in the U. S. five years 
ago, and took an after-school job at Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 After an angry customer spat at him when he forgot to include taco sauce with 
the man's order, Flores said, "I realized I had come here for something else," 
for a life better than one as a fast-food worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents weren't here, I could have done what I wanted . . . hung around 
and become a gangster," said Flores. "I was hanging around a crowd that partied 
a lot and I could have easily stayed a part of that. Thank God, I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed an extra year in high school, learning English and then stumbling 
onto photography in the fall of 1991 when the adviser of the campus newspaper 
suggested he try journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started taking pictures and through that I was able to earn scholarships," 
Flores said. "I shot pictures all through the riots." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores enrolled at CSUN using counterfeit residency documents, thinking that 
proof of legal status was required. During his first semester, Flores continued 
to live with an aunt in South Los Angeles, traveling five hours a day on the 
bus to school. "That was my commitment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to the Valley his second semester. Besides a full load of classes, he 
worked 20 hours a week entering computer data at a Sun Valley sales firm. 
During his sophomore year, he received scholarships to pay for tuition and 
books. This year, he is struggling financially but knows he is better off than 
most in his home country. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some villages there is nothing to do but stare at the dirt floor," he 
said. "People come here to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores said he has two dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 One is to be able to afford to bring his mother to the U. S. and pay for 
medical treatments that she cannot afford in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 The second is to make a living shooting pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "In El Salvador, the media seldom tells the truth," he said. "So I want people 
to know both sides of the story. . . . During the riots I took a lot of 
pictures of people helping each other. After that experience I decided, this is 
what I want to do, to tell the truth."

DESPITE CRACKDOWN, DRUG 'CAT' IS SPREADING ACROSS MIDWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For five years now, in apartments and college dormitories, in the back seats 
of cars, in hunting cabins nestled in the birch and maple stands of the north 
woods, the drug methcathinone has been cooking throughout Michigan's Upper 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cat," as it is commonly called, is a chemical cousin of both methamphetamine 
and the Somali khat plant and is easy to make from readily available 
ingredients that range from paint thinner to lye. It is cheap. It is powerful, 
pleasurable and intensely habit-forming. It is dangerous, leading to paranoia, 
extreme weight loss, bloody noses and loss of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 After the seizure of 34 cat labs, authorities here say they believe that they 
are slowing an epidemic of abuse that has overwhelmed emergency rooms and 
addiction centers on this isthmus dividing Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite -- or perhaps because of -- the crackdown here in cat's cradle, 
the drug is now spreading through the Midwest and beyond. The recipe has been 
passed along from friend to friend, sold for thousands of dollars, published in 
a book and distributed on the Internet computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been other so-called designer drugs in the past, but law 
enforcement officials find cat especially worrisome because it is so simple to 
put together and so similar to methamphetamine and cocaine in its effects. 
"This is nasty stuff," said Phil Streicher, a U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration investigator based here. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 31 clandestine labs in nine other states have now been closed down, 
with the largest number clustered in Indiana and Wisconsin. The drug has made 
scattered appearances as far afield as Washington state, Colorado, Montana, 
Idaho and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly every case, the suspects have ties to the Upper Peninsula. But last 
week federal agents discovered a cat lab in Wichita, Kan., when they raided a 
house where they thought methamphetamine was being made. The resident 
drug-maker learned the recipe from a book that can be ordered through a post 
office box in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula is also reaching a potential audience of millions through the 
Internet. The recipe has been distributed via computer for more than a year, 
and there is a clear demand for it. E-mail queries were posted last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "BE CAREFUL," warned one anonymous computer file containing detailed 
cat-making instructions. "Don't introduce this stuff to kids or sell it, or I 
will personally hunt you down." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government plans to place controls on the sale of ephedrine, a key 
ingredient in both cat and methamphetamine. Effective Nov. 10, sellers of 
ephedrine in chemical form will be required to register with the DEA and record 
buyers' names and addresses. Sales of ephedrine tablets, marketed as a diet aid 
and stimulant and available by mail-order, at truck stops and at health food 
stores, are expected to face similar restrictions by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that change may not pose an obstacle to cat's spread. Ephedrine will 
be more difficult to get, but it will not be banned. It is being smuggled 
across the Mexican border as well. 
</P>
<P>
 And an Internet message advises that an over-the-counter cold medicine 
containing a related chemical is one potential alternative ephedrine source. A 
DEA pharmacologist confirmed the tip's accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the DEA in theory could place controls on such medicines, "it would 
be difficult," said Gene R. Haislip, the agency's deputy assistant 
administrator. "I don't look forward to having to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cat is widely abused in Russia, where it is known as "jeff," "mulka" or 
"ephedrone." But its emergence as a recreational drug in the United States 
apparently began with a pharmaceutical company employee who was ordered to 
destroy old batches of substances that never were marketed, according to John 
Boyer, a DEA intelligence analyst based in Detroit. One of the substances was 
methcathinone, which was considered for production in the 1950s to treat 
depression but was shelved because of its severe side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1989 the employee allegedly brought the stuff to parties with friends 
from the University of Michigan. They figured out how to duplicate cat. The 
drug didn't catch on in Ann Arbor. "It would be hard to go to classes on cat," 
Boyer theorized. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the students, Philip Pavlik, dropped out and moved home to 
Marquette, a college town on Lake Superior's shores with a population of about 
22,000 people. He already had been giving cat samples to his younger brother, 
Andrew, who shared it with his friends. Together, the Pavliks started throwing 
cat parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have no idea and will not accept what a Pandora's box they opened," 
Streicher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Grimes, who was a tavern cook, had known the Pavliks in high school. Soon 
he was an assistant during cat-making sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes had cheated his way through high school chemistry, but he learned the 
cat process well enough to start hosting parties in his own apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 And so cat spread. In a region rife with unemployment and boredom, there were 
plenty of people anxious to try something cheap and new. "It fit culturally 
too," said Don Simila, an addiction counselor at the Marquette Medical Clinic. 
"We can vegetables, can fish, shoot deer. We don't rely on outsiders. Here was 
a drug we could make for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Then too, in the beginning, everyone thought that cat was legal. Indeed, there 
were no state laws against the drug. But federal law prohibits the manufacture 
of substances similar to illegal drugs that are used for similar effects. So 
when Michigan State Police began picking up cat, they called in the DEA and the 
U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pavliks were arrested in 1991. So was Grimes. He learned something else in 
the detox tank at the Marquette County Jail: "I hadn't known that I was hooked. 
I felt like I had a temperature of 1 million degrees. I could hardly breathe. 
My whole body ached." 
</P>
<P>
 The night after his release, he was snorting cat again. 
</P>
<P>
 By the following summer, cat cases were showing up in the emergency room at 
Marquette General Hospital. A report in the Annals of Emergency Medicine 
describes four cases in a five-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: A 19-year-old honor student with slurred speech, tremors, 
hallucinations and paranoia was brought in by his mother. He had just smoked 
cat for the first time. And a 34-year-old teacher injected cat repeatedly over 
four days; she lay on the floor for three hours one night because she thought 
police were outside and would shoot her. She spent three days in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, emergency room physician T. Scott Emerson could find no medical 
literature on cat. He ended up telephoning Russian doctors for guidance on how 
to treat this new flurry of patients. 
</P>
<P>
 When Grimes was arrested a second time, he weighed a skeletal 131 pounds, 
though he stands 6-foot-1. His perspiration smelled like model-airplane glue. 
Blood oozed from his nostrils and ears. Now 24, he was sentenced to six months 
of home detention and is on probation. He has gained 39 pounds and has gone 
back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 58 people have either pleaded guilty or been convicted in cat-lab 
cases in the Upper Peninsula. A group arrested in August near the Wisconsin 
border was brewing the drug for much more than personal consumption. Indeed, 
Streicher said, its members had subcontracted out some of their business. 
Manufacture of cat by non-users has been the authorities' greatest fear: An 
investment of $56 could yield $1,900 worth of the drug for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is hope here that the worst is over. Both Pavlik brothers are in 
jail. Some of the later sentences for cat manufacturing were as harsh as 18 
years in prison. The most recent arrests -- last week -- were for cat-making 
two years ago. Many cat processors known to authorities have fled the state. 
"It's somebody else's problem now," Streicher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it is. Last year, Upper Peninsula emigrants were arrested in distant 
places. A cat lab exploded in Craig, Colo.; the manufacturer was from the U.P., 
as the region is known. Of three people arrested for making cat in Mundelein, 
Ill., two were "Yoopers." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is causing concern," said DEA pharmacologist James Tolliver, who has 
monitored the drug since it first drew notice. "We are seeing it slowly move 
out. We have not been able to stamp it out in Michigan. Missouri has had a low 
level of activity for some time now and we simply haven't been able to get rid 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 And those are just the cat labs that have been uncovered. Tolliver said he 
finds the Internet traffic about the drug "quite troublesome. Who knows how 
many labs are out there right now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Just three months ago, a discussion group on the Internet was offered a memo 
titled "Tips for CAT Synthesis." It offered extra help for those who might make 
mistakes following the original recipe that was making the rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should be able to have success!" the author wrote, signing off as "The 
Anonymous Chemist."

TEXAS CASE LOOMS OVER PROP. 187'S LEGAL FUTURE; JUSTICE: U.S. HIGH COURT VOIDED 
THAT STATE'S '75 LAW ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. BUT PANEL HAS SINCE SHIFTED TO 
RIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seventeen years ago, third-grader Laura Alvarez was kicked out of elementary 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexico City-born daughter of illegal immigrants, Laura was one of tens of 
thousands of youngsters to feel the consequences of a 1975 Texas law that -- 
like California's controversial Proposition 187 -- said undocumented children 
no longer qualified for a free public education. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after being expelled, Laura recalls, she was awakened by her 
parents and seated in their aging station wagon for a pre-dawn ride on the 
clippity-clop, red-brick streets of downtown Tyler. Their destination: the 
imposing Federal Courthouse, where her parents, risking immediate deportation, 
testified in the courtroom of Judge William Wayne Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, acting on a lawsuit filed by civil rights lawyers, ordered Tyler 
schools Supt. James Plyler to allow undocumented students back into school. He 
also ordered that the identities of the 16 children named in the suit be 
withheld from the public to avoid possible harassment. The case, which came to 
be known as Plyler vs. Doe, eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, where, 
in a landmark 5-4 decision, the Texas law was declared unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of that decision, Alvarez, now 26, was able to graduate from John 
Tyler High School in 1987. She now works as a teacher's aide for the very 
school system that ejected her. 
</P>
<P>
 When California voters decide how to cast their ballots next month, the legal 
implications of Plyler vs. Doe will loom heavy over the ultimate fate of 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The California measure is far more sweeping than the Texas law. It would bar 
illegal immigrants from receiving non-emergency health and social services, as 
well as public education, and would require school and health officials to 
report suspected undocumented people to federal authorities. Many of its 
provisions are likely to inspire court challenges, but none more clearly than 
the educational component. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of Proposition 187 readily acknowledge that the Supreme Court would 
have to revisit its 1982 decision in order for the education ban to take 
effect. A "yes" vote on Election Day, they say, will pave the way for the high 
court to take a second look at the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Proposition 187 counter that its passage will serve only to 
ensure taxpayers a time-consuming, divisive and ultimately unsuccessful legal 
battle. A vote for 187, they say, is an expensive exercise in futility. 
</P>
<P>
 In its ruling, the Supreme Court for the first time extended the 
constitutional guarantee of "equal protection of the law" to people living in 
the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unjust to penalize children for the illegal actions of their parents, 
the court's majority said. And while public education is not a constitutionally 
granted right, it is nonetheless distinguishable from other forms of social 
welfare, the justices concluded, because of "the lasting impact of its 
deprivation on the life of the child." 
</P>
<P>
 "By denying these children a basic education, we deny them the ability to live 
within the structure of our civic institutions, and foreclose any realistic 
possibility that they will contribute in even the smallest way to the progress 
of our nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of Proposition 187 say conditions in California are different from 
those in Texas in the mid-1970s. Such factors, they say, will give the Supreme 
Court reason to ignore or reverse its previous ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the magnitude of the illegal immigrant population appears 
greater in California. Here, the estimated number of youngsters who would be 
expelled exceeds 300,000 -- three to 30 times the number of undocumented young 
people that, according to various estimates, were attending school in Texas at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 By requiring school officials to report suspected illegal immigrant students 
and their parents to federal authorities, the initiative also takes a step, 
sponsors say, toward returning students to their native lands, where they could 
ostensibly complete their education. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, they emphasize, the makeup of the court has shifted dramatically to 
the right since the 1982 decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only one member who voted with the majority is still there," noted 
Proposition 187 co-author Alan C. Nelson, a former commissioner of the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes of Proposition 187 retort that the court has been extremely reluctant to 
overturn previous rulings, especially ones decided little more than a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, they say, the measure provides no clear provisions for deportation 
and is far more Draconian than the unconstitutional Texas law, which allowed 
children to remain in public school if they paid tuition fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, opponents add, is that the net effect of the Texas law and the 
ballot measure are precisely the same: to create a policy that would scapegoat 
children for the sins of their parents and lead to the expulsion of thousands 
of undocumented students. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading constitutional law professors say the chances of the measure's key 
educational sections being upheld are slim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This court is very serious about adhering to precedent in the absence of an 
overwhelming reason for change," said Prof. Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some cautioned that the high court's action is not a foregone 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a possibility the court can simply draw on distinctions, and 
say it's a different case in California, when anyone who looks at it says these 
distinctions don't call for a different result," said UCLA law professor Julian 
Eule. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome, one thing is clear -- the parameters of debate about 
illegal immigration have shifted markedly. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Supreme Court issued its ruling, even the judges who dissented wrote 
that expelling students is "senseless for an enlightened society." 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be folly -- and wrong -- to tolerate creation of a segment of 
society made up of illiterate persons, many having a limited or no command of 
our language," declared then-Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, in a minority 
opinion joined by William H. Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor, both of whom 
remain on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The California State Board of Education, made up of people appointed or 
reappointed by Pro-187 Gov. Pete Wilson, has declined to take a stand on the 
ballot measure. But back when the Supreme Court was considering the Plyler 
case, the California board filed a legal brief in favor of the Texas 
schoolchildren. "It has never been demonstrated that education is more 
expensive than ignorance," the board wrote in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent times, Plyler has done some shifting himself. "If we don't provide 
education, children will be a greater burden and cost more in the long run," 
the retired Tyler school chief told The Times. "For taxpayers, it's either pay 
me now, or pay me later." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tyler, a sleepy, sylvan East Texas city of 75,000, was home to roughly 40 
undocumented youngsters back in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 When the state law first took effect, the city's school district ignored it, 
picking up the cost of educating the children itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But that policy proved short-lived. In July, 1977, school board members, 
fearing that the city would turn into a haven for illegal immigrants, ordered 
them to pay $1,000 a year in tuition. The fee was tantamount to expulsion. Most 
of the immigrants had jobs in Tyler foundries or restaurants, but their pay was 
no more than $4,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1977 school year began Aug. 31, and Rosario Robles still recalls the 
rebuff she received that morning when she walked her children to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles and her husband, Jose, a pipe factory employee, had lived together in 
Tyler for five years. Despite being undocumented, they owned their own home and 
paid school taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at Bonner Elementary, they were told: No birth certificates, no school. 
The principal proceeded to place Rosario Robles and five of her children in his 
car and drive them back home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family made immediate arrangements for some of their children to 
temporarily attend a parochial school, with Jose Robles doing yardwork at the 
school in exchange for tuition. They also turned to a Catholic Church outreach 
worker, Michael McAndrew, who contacted local civil rights lawyer Larry Daves. 
</P>
<P>
 Daves, in turn, phoned the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund. Within two days, MALDEF attorney Peter D. Roos flew from San Francisco to 
Tyler. Working through the Labor Day weekend, Roos filed a lawsuit on behalf of 
four willing families. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Justice scheduled a hearing for three days later and, to limit 
publicity, set it for 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 That morning, Lidia Lopez and her husband, Jose, packed their Dodge Monaco 
with all their worldly possessions for the pre-dawn drive to the courthouse, 
Lidia Lopez recalls. If Justice denied their suit out of hand, she says, they 
were prepared to be arrested and deported immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The four families entered the courthouse through a side door and participated 
in the hearing with the translation assistance of McAndrew. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Justice informed the parents that he had no right to withhold their 
names from the U.S. Justice Department. But department officials decided not to 
take action against the families so the lawsuit could proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Justice granted an injunction and eventually declared that 
Tyler's application of the law violated the equal protection provisions of the 
14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the judge's decision applied only to the Tyler school district. So a 
rash of similar lawsuits were filed across the state. When a decision was made 
to combine these suits, Los Angeles immigration rights attorney Peter A. Schey 
was called in as lead lawyer. That case was decided in the children's favor by 
a federal district judge in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Supreme Court level, the two cases were combined into Plyler vs. Doe. 
</P>
<P>
 In its opinion, the high court ruled that illegal immigrants had the right to 
the same education as all other Texas children. In addition, the court noted, 
"there is no assurance that a child subject to deportation will ever be 
deported." 
</P>
<P>
 "An illegal entrant might be granted federal permission to continue to reside 
in this country or even to become a citizen," Justice William J. Brennan Jr. 
wrote in the court's majority opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its focus on the importance of education, Plyler vs. Doe has never 
been extended to affect other types of benefits for illegal immigrants. It has 
nonetheless drawn its share of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 In his dissent, Burger charged that the five majority justices were engaging 
in policy-making rather than accepting the will of the Texas Legislature, which 
said its law was meant to conserve budget funds for legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the Legislature's reasoning was rational, Burger wrote, high court 
justices had no jurisdiction to strike down the law, even if, as in this case, 
their motives were "noble and compassionate." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Tyler, Laura Alvarez was completing seventh grade. Immersed in school 
-- and having been expelled for only a handful of days years earlier -- she 
never even heard about the historic 1982 decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I was back in school," she explained last week, "I never thought 
anything more about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the years went by, the identities of the 16 Mexico-born children remained 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the curious was John C. Hardy, the Tyler attorney who represented the 
school district before the Supreme Court. "I just wonder if they made it 
through school -- who graduated and what they did with the opportunity that was 
given to them." 
</P>
<P>
 With names provided by Daves, The Times this month was able to track down 
three of the four families and compile information on 13 of the 16 youngsters 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, 10 finished high school in Tyler. Many have gone on to take 
college courses, although none has graduated from a four-year institution. 
Several are single and others are married with as many as four children. Most 
have full-time jobs -- two work as teacher's aides, two on a box factory 
assembly line, and others as auto mechanic, burger stand manager, painter and 
stock clerk. Three are full-time housewives. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members say all are now legal residents, mainly through the federal 
amnesty program of the mid-1980s. In short, the "Does" of Plyler vs. Doe turned 
out a little like many other blue-collar schoolchildren across small-town 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without an education, I don't know where I'd be right now," reflects Alvarez, 
who, before being contacted by The Times, had never publicly revealed her 
participation in the lawsuit. "I'm a taxpayer now and you have to view 
everything from both sides, but if a child is denied an education, they're 
going to be a burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Lopez, a 1987 graduate of Tyler High, said, "The only reason I got in 
the automotive business is because I took automobile mechanic courses in high 
school which led to my employment." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez actually has two jobs -- as a Sears auto mechanic and a warehouse 
worker. He also has a Tyler-born wife of Mexican descent, two young children 
and a house with a 15-year mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alfredo is a fine young man," said Jim Blake, his boss at Sears. "He's very 
honest, an upstanding young man in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake shudders to think what would have happened to Lopez and the others if 
they had been tossed out of public school before they were 10 years old. "We 
have to do something to control our border," he said, "but I can't see throwing 
kids on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the four "Doe" families has moved out of Tyler, and, according to 
McAndrew, the children probably fared more poorly. "Their mother was separated 
from the father and had humongous problems with welfare," McAndrew, now an 
immigration counselor, said. "If she worked, the kids would be taken away from 
her. If she didn't, there was not enough money. The children were very small at 
the time, and they had a stacked deck against them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the election 16 days away, Proposition 187 has become the hottest issue 
in California, and the education ban is at the heart of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're quite aware of Plyler and that needs to be dealt with," said former INS 
chief Nelson. "I welcome the chance to bring these matters before the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 To be precise, the lawsuit would be handled at taxpayers' expense through the 
state attorney general's office. Staffers have already spent time studying the 
matter to prepare for an immediate blitz of lawsuits if Proposition 187, which 
currently holds a solid lead in statewide polls, wins approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those planning suits are Roos and Schey, the two key attorneys for the 
schoolchildren in Plyler vs. Doe. 
</P>
<P>
 If the initiative passes, Schey said, "the only result is that taxpayers will 
foot the bill for years of litigation and the chances of it ever being 
implemented are close to zero." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Tyler has witnessed some of the same signs of progress and 
growing pains as many other American towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Strip malls now gather like tumbleweed on the Southeast Loop Road. Street 
gangs and drive-by shootings have also come to Tyler. Last Monday, a 
17-year-old alleged gang member was found shot to death in the city's oldest 
park. It was the third gang-related killing reported in Tyler this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, Alfredo Lopez's young son, Michael, is due to start kindergarten. 
Lopez says he is working two jobs to help scrape together the money to allow 
Michael to attend private school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public schools have changed drastically -- there are too many students 
per teacher and now we have metal detectors in our schools," Alfredo said. "We 
didn't have anything like that when I graduated." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is no talk here of revisiting the Plyler decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a landmark case," said school board attorney Hardy, "and one of the 
obstacles California would face is the fact that by historical standards, it 
happened yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the courthouse, Judge Justice, now nearly 75 years old, is still going 
strong. But Plyler vs. Doe is the last thing on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may seem like a hot new issue in California," explained Justice's 
secretary, Evelyn Armstrong. "But here in Tyler, it's in the past." 1 'Aye,' 2 
'Nays' Still on Court 
</P>
<P>
 In its June 15, 1982, Plyler vs. Doe ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court struck 
down as unconstitutional a 1975 Texas law that cut off state funds for the 
schooling of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The five justices in the majority were William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood 
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Lewis F. Powell Jr. Only 
Stevens remains on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The four dissenting judges were Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, William H. 
Rehnquist, Sandra Day O'Connor and Byron R. White. Rehnquist, now the chief 
justice, and O'Connor remain on the court.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / THE LEGISLATURE; A CHANGING OF THE OLD GUARD IN 
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE and JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 101 contests for state Assembly and Senate seats on the Nov. 8 election 
ballot are ushering in a new era in California legislative politics. 
</P>
<P>
 After wielding influence in the powerful Assembly Speaker's post for a record 
14 years, Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) is running for his seat in the lower 
house for the last time. Brown will be leaving the Assembly after two more 
years, forced out by voter-approved term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The election also serves as a moment of truth for new Senate President Pro Tem 
Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), who is struggling to maintain Democratic control of 
the upper house in the face of a strong challenge from Republican candidates, 
some of whose campaigns are fueled by contributions from the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the changing of the guard in the Capitol, spurred by term limits, 
27 incumbents decided to retire or run for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps more important for the future than the stature of those departing, 
their replacements will increasingly mirror the state's diversity, with women 
and Latinos expected to enhance their numbers and be joined by the first openly 
gay state legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democrats believe they will maintain their majorities in both houses, 
the potentially volatile anti-Democratic mood of voters has candidates worrying 
and raising large amounts of money to win their elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans see a banner year, with dislike of President Clinton weighing down 
his fellow Democrats, even those at the state level. Democrats say that 
California voters will follow their traditional independent pattern and zigzag 
down the ballot, not voting a straight party line. 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring the anxiety, Speaker Brown, who bankrolls many campaigns, not 
surprisingly has urged all Democratic hopefuls to walk precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am encouraging everyone to walk and campaign and do everything that they 
did to first get them up here," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Speaker is not following his own advice. "I don't need to," Brown 
said. "If I walked precincts, it would take away from the time I spend raising 
money for other Assembly Democratic candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoking the uncertainty is the fact that voters are much more focused on the 
glitzier races at the top of the ballot than on low-profile contests for all 80 
Assembly seats and 21 of the Senate's 40 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Assembly, among the Democratic hopefuls expected to win -- and add a 
new dimension -- are Santa Monica law professor and former television actress 
Shelia Kuehl, who would be the first openly gay member of the Legislature, and 
attorney Kevin Murray, who, with his father, Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. 
(D-Paramount), would form the first father-son duo to serve simultaneously in 
the same house. 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie ranks also are likely to include Republican farmer Tom J. Bordonaro 
Jr. of Paso Robles, who uses a wheelchair and is expected to capture a Central 
Coast Assembly seat vacated by a GOP incumbent who is running for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Rules Committee has agreed to spend at least $85,000 in tax money 
to make Capitol offices more accessible for him and meet federal disability 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcomes of many races, however, are far less certain. Indeed, campaign 
strategists say that voters only begin to focus on legislative candidates in 
the final days before the election, when they receive a blizzard of targeted 
mail largely underwritten by contributions from special interests with business 
before the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaigns are laced with themes about cracking down on crime, controlling 
illegal immigration, regulating gambling and the rising age of some entrenched 
incumbents, especially in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters know exactly what they're going to do: kill politicians. They're just 
deciding which ones," said veteran Democratic campaign strategist Richie Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to capitalize on voter antipathy toward politicians, Assembly 
Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said he hopes the Republicans 
can pick up two or three seats. Democrats now hold a 47-33 edge over 
Republicans in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte also said that he believes there are four Democratic incumbents in 
serious trouble. They are Assembly members Bob Epple of Cerritos and rookies 
Betty Karnette of Long Beach, Julie Bornstein of Palm Desert and Tom Connolly 
of Lemon Grove. All four won narrow election in 1992, as fellow Democrat 
Clinton carried California in the presidential election. Perhaps the most 
vulnerable Democrat of the lot is Connolly. In a 30-second TV commercial, the 
affable Connolly asks voters for a second chance even though he admits to 
having been a cocaine addict, a failed husband, a deadbeat dad, a tax 
delinquent and a failed businessman. He is being challenged by Republican Steve 
Baldwin, who barely lost to Connolly in 1992 before the assemblyman's problems 
were well known. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, meanwhile, are eyeing the seat now held by freshman Assemblyman 
Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena), who has raised tens of thousands of dollars from 
gambling interests. Democratic campaign consultants maintain that he is 
vulnerable to a challenge from Bruce Philpott, a retired police officer who 
served as Pasadena police chief for two years. Hoge has received $30,000 from 
the Allied Business PAC, the political action committee formed by Orange County 
Sen. Rob Hurtt and conservative Christian businessmen, to elect conservatives. 
Since 1992, it has reported giving more than $1.7 million to candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer has deplored the activities of Hurtt and his group, saying they seek 
to establish a religious oligarchy. Hurtt has scoffed at the assertion, 
describing himself merely as a conservative who opposes abortions and favors 
school vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer has sought to drum up financial support for Democrats in the Senate, 
where Republicans see their best chance in years to cut into Democrat strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the lineup is 22 Democrats, 15 Republicans, two independents and one 
vacancy because of the conviction on federal political corruption charges and 
subsequent resignation of former Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier). A special 
election to fill Hill's seat also is being held Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 21 seats up for grabs this November, Democrats hold 14. Two Latino 
Assembly members, Democrats Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Hilda Solis of 
El Monte, are expected to coast to easy victories in safely Democratic Senate 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 But in swing districts, the picture is different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, Republicans are leading and Democrats are faltering in a lot of 
districts," GOP Senate strategist Ron Rogers said. But he is not predicting a 
Republican takeover this year in the upper house and acknowledges that the 
final 10 days of the campaign is really "when the struggle is on for the hearts 
and minds of voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, half a dozen Senate seats are being heavily contested from Redding to 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 One pitched battle to replace retiring Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) 
features Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), an energetic 
campaigner, squaring off against Steve MacElvaine, a Republican former San Luis 
Obispo County supervisor and onetime member of the California Coastal 
Commission. MacElvaine is painting the boyish-looking O'Connell, 43, as a 
career politician and the election is considered a tossup. 
</P>
<P>
 In another open Senate seat held by a Democrat, freshman Assemblyman Ray 
Haynes (R-Murrieta) is matched against Democrat Kay Ceniceros, a longtime 
Riverside County supervisor. Staunch conservative Haynes is banking on strong 
financial help from the Christian right to defeat Ceniceros in the district in 
which Republicans hold a registration edge over Democrats. Haynes has received 
$64,000 this year from the Allied Business political action committee, 
according to state-required reports. 
</P>
<P>
 A second contest expected to be a showdown between Democrats and the religious 
right is taking place in a district that stretches from the edge of San 
Francisco Bay to the Oregon border. Sen. Maurice Johannessen (R-Redding), who 
was elected in a special election last year, is facing a stiff challenge from 
Yolo County Supervisor Michael H. McGowan, who is relying on monetary support 
from Lockyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Another incumbent conservative Republican facing a strong, well-financed 
challenge is Sen. Phil Wyman (R-Tehachapi). Wyman last year won a special 
election but is seeking a full term in a more heavily Democratic farm belt 
district redrawn in reapportionment. Like last year, Wyman is facing 
Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Hanford). 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hottest Senate contests in the Los Angeles area pits Sen. Ralph 
Dills (D-El Segundo), first elected to the Legislature in 1938, against 
Republican rival David Barrett Cohen, a Redondo Beach businessman who is part 
Samoan and is Jewish, who reports receiving a $20,000 donation from Hurtt. One 
of the Legislature's flashiest dressers, the blue-haired, saxophone-playing 
Dills, 84, uses the campaign slogan "Too Old to Quit."'

GOV. WILSON'S NOT-SO-SECRET CAMPAIGN WEAPON; POLITICS: FOR THE FOURTH TIME IN 
THEIR MARRIAGE, GAYLE WILSON IS HARD AT WORK TRYING TO 'HUMANIZE' HER HUSBAND 
TO VOTERS -- AND HELP FEMINIZE HIS POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If, as has been said before, Pete Wilson looks the way California feels -- 
tired, cranky and peevish -- then his wife, Gayle, is looking the way 
California wants to feel: chipper, smiling, glad to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 That's also a shorthand assessment for the political job-sharing component of 
the Wilsons' partnership. In her fourth and possibly last "Wilson for ---" 
campaign, the state's first lady still believes that one of her best and 
highest roles is to "humanize" her husband to the vast and querulous California 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in a lot of ways, when people meet me, they think, 'Well, he can't be 
so bad,' if they like me," she said. "People" see her as the disarming, warm 
one while her husband (and how this galls her) comes across as the dour man 
with negative ratings about as high as his current poll numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, as her husband runs against a woman who holds a triple-A rating on 
women's movement issues, Gayle Wilson -- to neutralize his opponent -- is 
cruising the state not only humanizing but helping to feminize her husband's 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Not ceding the double-X chromosome vote to Kathleen Brown, Gayle Wilson takes 
her "I the Gov" enameled pin and her humor and her Junior League chic into the 
kind of venues -- breast cancer fund-raisers, neonatal intensive care units, 
Women in Science projects -- that the wooden Wilson could not hope to crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brought her to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 At a $25-a-plate fund-raiser lunch -- big cookies, small sandwiches -- some 
300 women gathered at the fairway home of an orthopedic surgeon. In the autumn 
sun of the Central Valley, some wobbled as their high heels sank into the moss 
lawn. Gayle Wilson is too practiced for such a mistake; she shakes hands in 
fail-safe, low-heeled black-on-black spectator pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who introduced her, Kay Meek, made the point clear: "This turnout 
certainly proves the governor for California's women just happens to be a man." 
</P>
<P>
 And Gayle Wilson, with the sheaf of note cards she holds more for security 
than for necessity, for she has gotten this riff down, obliges with her stump 
speech, rounding the bases of Wilson policies and putting special emphasis on 
things of interest to women: 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's "one-strike" policy for aggravated rapists and child molesters 
(applause). Streamlined procedures for new businesses, and the fact that 3 of 
10 business owners are women. A few personal touches ("I was never more proud 
of him than when he gave his clemency statement" deploring the childhood abuse 
and the adult crimes of executed murderer Robert Alton Harris). And praise for 
Kathryn M. Werdegar, Wilson's Supreme Court appointee, a "terrific" woman, "a 
very pretty, feminine woman," and the governor's law school classmate. "He used 
to like to carry her books until she was No. 1 in the class." 
</P>
<P>
 The women laughed ripplingly; this is the kind of bonus you get for your $25, 
the stuff you can pass along at lunch the next day, the stuff you don't hear in 
campaign ads. 
</P>
<P>
 The Werdegar remarks -- the point of a smart woman who is also feminine -- 
also bookend Gayle Wilson, 51, a woman somewhere between the Age of Eisenhower 
and the Age of Aquarius, a Stanford premed Phi Beta Kappa who got married in 
her junior year, a Westinghouse science scholar who, as a housewife and mother 
of two boys, did volunteer work and began a home sewing business. 
</P>
<P>
 She married U. S. Sen. Pete Wilson in 1983, the second marriage for both. And 
she is still a volunteer, with one cause. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived here in the morning, a trifle late after a queasy flight from 
Sacramento in a private plane. "This actually isn't too bad," the pilot 
remarked; "Easy for you to say," she answered. 
</P>
<P>
 A not-new light blue Ford ferried her to Kern Medical Center, to tie in the 
beginning of National Child Health Month to the work of BabyCal, the state's 
program to combat low birth-weight babies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new, softly lit neonatal ICU, Wilson put on about her thousandth white 
surgical gown for about her thousandth tour. The first, as a senator's wife, 
was at Martin Luther King/Drew Medical Center, and she could see on her 
escort's face, " 'Oh God, we've got another politician's wife coming through 
here,' until she realized that I not only had a true interest but some 
background." 
</P>
<P>
 The couples and babies she stopped to talk with at Kern Medical Center were 
black, like Janice Pierce and Clarence Stubbs, finally able to hold -- even let 
the governor's wife hold -- their 30-week-old daughter Shasta (named for the 
soft drink, they said, not the California peak). 
</P>
<P>
 And most of the people waiting in the auditorium for Wilson's remarks about 
BabyCal were African American women and their infants, targets of this year's 
BabyCal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until a young Latino doctor, Augustine Munoz, asked: "What is Proposition 
187 going to do to this program?" did the sometimes unhappy conflict of policy 
and politics arise. 
</P>
<P>
 State health director Kim Belshe took that question -- that BabyCal is 
outreach and education, not direct care -- but Wilson was later asked the same 
thing by a reporter: how to reconcile her decade-long work for prevention, 
something she has lobbied the governor ardently on, with Proposition 187? 
</P>
<P>
 She has disagreed with her husband in the past, as on federal funding for 
abortions, but on this she holds fast, an edge of frustration in her voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably not a perfectly written initiative and I think it's going to 
send a message to the federal government that we feel strongly about them 
taking charge of the borders," Wilson said. "I don't know that we yet know 
what's going to happen. . . . BabyCal is not going to be affected by this 
because it's not a medical service, it's just promoting prenatal care." 
</P>
<P>
 How can you urge people to seek care and then make it illegal for them to get 
it? 
</P>
<P>
 "You know something?" she said finally. "We have a real budget problem, and we 
need to spend the money on legal residents." Other infant programs, she noted, 
have run out of money to serve residents. "Those are California citizens and 
their babies are not getting prenatal care." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the women shifting in the hot sun, she shares a life-in-the-Statehouse 
campaign story: "I left him a note last night before he got in, saying, 'Honey, 
I'm leaving at 8 tomorrow morning,' and he left me a note saying, 'Wake me up 
before you leave.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing that would make campaigning easier, make public policy easier, 
she says later, eating lunch upstairs in the fund-raiser host's beamed and 
chandeliered house, is "if major television stations would have a bureau in 
Sacramento. . . . That would make the biggest difference . . . a more informed 
electorate." 
</P>
<P>
 "People say to me, 'Why are we only hearing from your husband now? Where has 
he been the last three years?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She bites her tongue on the sarcastic answers she could give, and offers this: 
"When you figure . . . we all would just watch the three networks, everyone had 
a common knowledge. . . . Now you can live in ESPN-land, you can live in Home 
Shopping-land. I am astonished by how little people know, and these are complex 
issues that frankly a 30-second spot can't address." 
</P>
<P>
 As much of an unknown as she is, too, there is one thing that even first-time 
acquaintances learn: Gayle Wilson sings. Sings well. Duets, too. With her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sang in a Junior League benefit musical revue in San Diego years ago -- 
she was already a regular with a local amateur group called "Show Biz" -- and 
after they got married, they got a karaoke machine. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a long campaign; Pete gave her a new karaoke machine last 
Christmas, but they have had little time to use it, even in the 10-couple 
groups that meet three times a year for singing dinner parties. 
</P>
<P>
 In other gatherings, the men may be reluctant to warble a love song, but 
"after they have a glass of wine," they're willing, she laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 The fame of her a cappella campaign songs has preceded her, and the hot, 
wilting women at the fund-raiser perk up when she says, "I find I can often say 
in a song what I might not say in a speech." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's version is to a tune called "A Most Unusual Day," from a 1948 Jane 
Powell-Elizabeth Taylor movie called "A Date with Judy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete's a most remarkable man/You can tell I'm his number one fan. . . . 
There's a great new L.A. Times poll/Shows our ads have taken their toll/Makes 
me wanna shout/'This will take Kathleen out'/But I must show some 
self-control." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this will be the campaign swan song for Gayle Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of talk about the presidency, if Pete Wilson wins in November, could 
this be the last hurrah? 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say so. . . . He's always wanted to be governor. It's certainly" -- 
and this she says without a bit of deadpan humor -- "a challenging job."

ON CALIFORNIA: WHAT HAVE WE BEEN SMOKING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago, this pretty town along the Central Coast of California made a 
sort of history. It became the first municipality in the nation to go 
smokeless. Smoking was banned in the workplace, banned in restaurants, banned 
even in bars. The law's been well-accepted everywhere, except maybe the saloons 
for serious drinkers. At these bars, patrons usually can be found huddled 
together just outside the door, grumpily smoking a quick cigarette between 
cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a saying," chuckles Jerry Reiss, who as a City Council member wrote 
the anti-smoking ordinance. "In San Luis Obispo you have to go inside to get 
some fresh air." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the town was only a tiny bit ahead of the times. Cities up and down 
California have followed with similar anti-smoking laws. Davis went the 
furthest, effectively banning cigarette smoking on sidewalks. And in what 
seemed a culmination of the movement, Gov. Pete Wilson last July signed a 
statewide ban on smoking in most workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Propelling this crusade is scientific research into the risks of secondhand 
smoke. It has changed the social dynamic: Putting a nail in your own coffin is 
one thing; putting a nail in mine is something else again. Also, cigarettes 
have been losing constituents. Smoking is less popular. The Marlboro Man 
mentality has ridden into the sunset. Only 1 in 5 Americans now smokes. The 
numbers continue to drop nationwide, but nowhere faster than in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Which takes us to the counterrevolution -- Proposition 188 on your November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a proposition that declares itself to be an anti-smoking ordinance. 
The word tough runs throughout the ballot argument in favor of its passage. 
Tough and restrictive. Tough annual review. Tough, uniform statewide 
restrictions. Proposition 188, however, happens to have been conceived and 
financed by the Phillip Morris Co. The Phillip Morris Co. happens to make 
cigarettes. Rabid cynicism is not required to question the measure's sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do foxes," one opponent has written, "build fences around chickens?" 
</P>
<P>
 What Proposition 188 would do is this: It would kill local ordinances like the 
one in effect here. It would invalidate the new state anti-smoking legislation, 
replacing it with a more smoker-friendly California law. Restaurateurs could 
reopen smoking sections. Smokers would be accommodated at the workplace, with 
lounges and so forth. Bars would be havens again for smokers. And what about 
secondhand smoke? Well, tough. 
</P>
<P>
 That a tobacco company would fight to maintain a beachhead for its market does 
not surprise. More arresting is the fact that so many nonsmoking Californians 
would join the cause. Proposition 188 has led consistently in the polls. The 
latest had the measure up by six points. Many explanations for this have been 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 First off, there's money: Phillip Morris has contributed millions for the 
campaign, compared to the mere thousands raised by its opponent. Also, this is 
a tremendously noisy political season, with several other battles that, 
frankly, seem more important. In addition, the proposition is a clever piece of 
writing that, on first reading, creates the illusion of a crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, there is the political mood. It seems the people are leery 
anymore of anything that smacks of government intrusion -- even smoking laws. 
Nor do they cotton much to the constant nagging from scientific quarters, 
warning about everything from roast beef to suntans. This is a good time to 
make the case that, cough, cough, ciggies aren't such a danger after all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to George Wheaton. The 81-year-old bartender is an expert on smoking. 
He's done it since he was 10. "Acupuncture, hypnosis, tried everything to 
quit." Now he has just quit trying. "At my age," he says with a quick smile, 
"what the hell does it matter?" 
</P>
<P>
 He stands at the tavern door, taking fast, furtive drags like some kid behind 
a schoolyard backstop. His clientele beckons, but he needs a smoke, and so 
outside he must be. "A helluva note," he says. In a rapid-fire style that comes 
from squeezing conversation between drink calls, Wheaton tears one by one 
through anti-smoking arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Health hazards? 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't buy it one bit. My dad smoked all his life. Lived to be 94." 
</P>
<P>
 Secondhand smoke? 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't believe in it. There's worse. Follow one of those buses with your 
window down. You'll be dead before you reach Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer people smoking? 
</P>
<P>
 "Propaganda. They're smoking, all right. As much as ever." 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps here old George makes his best point. For Californians to be 
buying this Phillip Morris campaign, the statistics must be wrong. There must 
be a load of people out there smoking. Something.

DOWN ON THE RIVER; DAYS MAY BE NUMBERED FOR VAGABOND VILLAGE IN VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The shantytown pokes out through the brush and the tall grass of a dusty 
riverbed, an old squatters camp swollen over the years by hard luck and hard 
times into Ventura County's largest homeless community. 
</P>
<P>
 It stretches more than two miles up the Ventura River, unfolding in a 
collection of plywood shacks and nylon tents, housing as many as 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocates say this vagabond village is perhaps the last of its kind 
in Southern California, a stubborn holdout in a day when homeless encampments 
elsewhere are being banished and bulldozed. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who work closest with the homeless have argued for years that something 
should be done about this place called the "river bottom." But the money for 
any alternative has never been forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the homeless advocates have been joined by a new coalition of 
environmentalists and political leaders in Ventura who say they plan to push 
harder for a solution to what they see as a monument to decades of community 
apathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The absence of direction is allowing this to continue," said Ventura City 
Councilwoman Rosa Less Measures, who is leading the push to pull the homeless 
out of the riverbed. "It's a depressing, discouraging, sad omen for our 
society, and I'm committed to doing what I can to make the changes where all 
will benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Measures wants to create a campground where the homeless can live and receive 
help from social service agencies. At the same time, she wants the city to 
adopt a policy of "zero tolerance" toward camping on all other public property, 
in effect outlawing river bottom camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Some homeless advocates worry that the new campground proposal could turn out 
to be little more than talk. And beyond the question of whether a new 
campground will ever become reality is the nagging question of how river bottom 
residents feel about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people down here probably won't go for it," said Craig, a 32-year-old 
Burbank native who lives in an oil field lean-to on the shantytown's north end. 
"I'll stay down here as long as they let me. If I could live this way the rest 
of my life, I would." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From a distance, it could be mistaken for a city dump; thick piles of garbage 
growing up here and there, rusted shopping carts buried deep in the white sand 
floor. Packs of dogs roam the place, picking through the squalor. 
</P>
<P>
 This place has been a friend to the homeless since at least World War II, a 
hobo jungle created by railroad tramps below the point where the Southern 
Pacific train trestle straddles the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, homeless advocates say the community is as large as it has ever been, 
accounting for roughly 10% of the estimated 2,000 homeless people in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs is a primitive place: No electricity. No bathrooms. No running water. 
Only a river polluted by decades of use as a latrine. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, despite its tired and tattered appearance, there is order in this 
jungle. Troublemakers are unwelcome and have been run out in the past. No one 
person or group rules the river bottom, but folks look out for each other. 
There is a sense of community and a code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 An old-timer named Pack Rat is the self-proclaimed "Chief of the River 
Bottom," having made his home in this overgrown nether world for more than half 
of his 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived on every inch of this place," he says, his home now staked out in 
the yawning gap between two concrete slabs holding up the Main Street bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 His real name is Ray Mahala, and he landed at the river bottom when it was 
primarily home to railroad tramps. He drifted upstream over the years as the 
city pushed the settlers out of the river mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 He has become an institution around this place, in his knee-high leather 
boots, leather pants and jacket and his badger-skin cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the few places left where a man can just lay down and live," 
Mahala said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a darker side to the old squatters camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocates estimate that 20% to 30% of the residents are mentally ill, 
and maybe half have substance abuse problems. Alcoholics, drug users and the 
deranged live together on the river floor with those who are simply down and 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the area has become a haven for drug use and other criminal 
activity, and firefighters say they are called to the river bottom at least 
once a week to put out runaway campfires. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates say that without any alternative, the homeless village will 
continue to grow. Only recently, a father and his two sons, 11 and 9, joined 
the exodus to the homeless shantytown. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther upstream, Ted Edwards and Peggy Wallace are raising their 2-year-old 
daughter in a three-room shack piled high with toys and parenting manuals. 
</P>
<P>
 A long line of social workers visited the couple when they decided to raise 
Andrial on the river bottom. The county workers concluded that despite the 
family's non-traditional lifestyle, she is being raised by loving parents in a 
stable home. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards and Wallace, both 40, say they know that some question the wisdom of 
raising a child on the river bottom. But it is their choice to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a beautiful, healthy daughter," Wallace said. "We've got a solid 
relationship. Neither of us has ulcers. What else can you ask for?" 
</P>
<P>
 The couple never intended to stay this long. When the lease ran out on their 
apartment six years ago, they took all their money, bought new camping gear and 
moved deep into the river bottom brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Andrial, a bright, rambunctious redhead who holds up an index finger 
on each hand when asked her age. They thought of moving out, but did not want 
to pay rent. Instead, they tacked together a shack out of old pallets and scrap 
wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they know they cannot stay here forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figure we've got a couple of more years, and then we're going to be up 
there where it's mean and dangerous," Edwards said. "No use exposing her to 
that any sooner than we have to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Public pressure has already put an end to some of Southern California's 
largest homeless encampments. In San Diego, the city is dismantling a migrant 
encampment that once sheltered 700 people. The Los Diablos squatters camp 
existed for more than 20 years in the shadow of multimillion-dollar homes on 
that city's north end. 
</P>
<P>
 But under pressure from nearby homeowners, the city condemned the encampment 
and is tearing it down, said the Rev. Rafael Martinez, who headed an advocacy 
group that helped the migrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of October it should be all gone," Martinez said. "Some of the 
families have been relocated to housing. But most have simply moved on to other 
camps or are living on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, police say the homeless have been repeatedly flushed out of a 
Santa Ana River encampment, but continue to return. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Riverside, police wiped out a river bottom encampment several years 
ago, said Arlene Hayes, who led an effort to improve conditions for river 
bottom dwellers in that city. The homeless simply returned to city streets and 
parks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura River bottom is now thought to constitute the largest collection 
of homeless residents in Southern California outside of the inner city, 
homeless advocates and other authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of another camp of that type on that scale," said Gary Blasi, a 
UCLA law professor and activist for the homeless. "These types of encampments 
are sort of a natural product of people having no place else to go. Whether 
they exist or not is largely the consequence of what the local attitude is 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
 But more than ever before, forces are aligning against the river bottom 
community, intent on bringing it to an end. Over the summer, officials 
conceived a plan to create a campground for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, the campground would serve as a gathering place for social 
service providers, a one-stop factory where the homeless can be repaired and 
reborn. 
</P>
<P>
 A key to any success for the campground proposal would be an accompanying 
"zero-tolerance" policy that would prohibit camping by the homeless anywhere 
else in the city, including the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities throughout Southern California have adopted such get-tough policies, 
including Santa Barbara, which did so in 1979. That law has withstood legal 
challenges and has been the model for ordinances adopted in cities from Long 
Beach to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has taken on greater urgency as Ventura tries to improve its 
downtown business district in an effort to lure more tourists. Also at issue is 
the city's growing interest in cleaning up the river bottom for ecological 
reasons and turn it into a nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the issue of the homeless themselves. City officials and 
homeless advocates say the river bottom settlers have been allowed to live in 
squalor long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "The river bottom to me has always been a mixed blessing," said Bob Costello 
of Project Understanding in Ventura. "It's kind of out of sight, out of mind, 
an area where people can live and be left alone. But for a lot of these people, 
it's the start of a downward spiral into a cycle of homelessness that's very 
hard to break out of." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Nazario, Ventura County's homeless ombudsman until the job was 
eliminated in budget cuts over the summer, is among those who hopes that 
something better is provided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a strong advocate for people living on the river bottom, getting 
into fights and drinking themselves to death," she said. "I've been in some of 
the encampments, and I've got a problem with those. I just don't feel very 
strongly about the need to have that kind of thing exist." 
</P>
<P>
 From his place below the bridge, Pack Rat sees the tide turning against the 
riverbed village. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just keep pushing us around," he said. "And now they've got us 
cornered."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / 1ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; NAPA RACE IS NEW, BUT THE 
BAD BLOOD IS VINTAGE '92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So you think all politicians are cut from the same cloth? And that nobody 
talks about issues, real issues, anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 Just come to the trees, vineyards and wide-open rural spaces that make up 
California's sprawling (and brawling) 1st Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 Here we have a Democratic incumbent and a Republican challenger who share 
nothing but a disdain for each other. And their debates are packed with enough 
facts and figures to satisfy even the most hard-core policy wonk. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent is Dan Hamburg, 44, a liberal, the product of a wealthy 
upbringing, a protester against the Vietnam War while at Stanford. He declines 
to wear a tie even while on the floor of the House of Representatives and is so 
handsome that People magazine named him to its list of American hunks. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenger is Frank Riggs, 46, a conservative, the son of a car salesman, 
an ex-police officer in Santa Barbara and Sonoma County and a drug investigator 
in the Army. He graduated from Golden Gate University, wears ties and has plain 
features and a receding hairline. 
</P>
<P>
 The two agreed to half a dozen debates sprinkled around the district, which 
includes Humboldt, Mendocino, Del Norte and Napa counties, and parts of Sonoma 
and Solano counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first head-to-head encounter, at Riesling Hall at the Napa County 
Fairgrounds, lasted for nearly two hours, with neither combatant giving an inch 
of ideological turf. 
</P>
<P>
 The two disagreed on nearly everything -- NAFTA, GATT, how to save the 
redwoods, health care reform, defense cutbacks, the 1994 crime bill, 
restrictions on assault weapons, the 1993 budget bill, public funding for 
abortions and who killed campaign reform in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Candidates Stick to the Issues," said the front-page headline in the 
(Fairfield) Daily Republic, as if the very idea of politicians talking about 
issues is unusual enough to be newsworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the roles were reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggs was the first-term incumbent and Hamburg, a former elementary 
schoolteacher and Mendocino County supervisor, was the challenger. Hamburg 
narrowly defeated Riggs, giving him the ignominious distinction of being the 
only congressman in the country defeated in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 So single-minded has Riggs been in his pursuit of political revenge that he 
jokes that when his 7-year-old daughter was asked recently what her father 
does, she responded, "He's Frank Riggs. He runs for Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburg calls Riggs "an attack dog" who, along with his private detective 
wife, is into the "cop thing," including snooping into the private lives of 
political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggs brands Hamburg as a limousine liberal, elitist and hypocrite. Riggs says 
the only thing Hamburg ever said that he agrees with is when he told a 
reporter, "Frank Riggs is everything I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond being a rip-snorter of a local race, the 1st District fight may affect 
an issue of statewide ecological significance: the survival of one of the last 
unprotected stands of redwoods along the state's northern coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburg sponsored a bill that passed the House that would have the federal 
government buy 44,000 acres of forest, including the redwoods, to spare them 
from the logging industry. Riggs, who had sponsored a more modest bill, argues 
that Hamburg's approach is too expensive and, if adopted, will fail for lack of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburg says Riggs is captive to the timber barons. Riggs retorts that Hamburg 
is part of the radical environmental movement that cares more for trees than 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither candidate is reluctant to play political hardball. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago Hamburg hit Riggs with a last-minute mailer accusing him of 
reneging on a promise to donate his congressional pay raise to charity. To make 
the allegation stick, certain facts had to be stretched a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 For this race, Riggs has uncovered Hamburg's draft records, which show that 
although Hamburg now says he opposed the idea of student deferments, he enjoyed 
a deferment during the Vietnam War and later was classified 4-F. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other congressional districts with first-term Democrats, President 
Clinton and his slump in popularity have become an election issue. But the use 
of Clinton is more nuanced in the 1st District than elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggs has stressed his die-hard opposition to those things most dear to the 
President: the 1993 budget bill, health care reform, the crime bill and the 
restriction on assault weapons. But he has not used the scalding anti-Clinton 
rhetoric favored by other Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats have an edge of 52% to 33% over Republicans in the district. Still, 
a poll by the Santa Rosa Press Democrat has the race a virtual dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggs told the debate audience that Hamburg is part of the "liberal left" that 
is dragging Clinton in its ideological direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (the Republicans) are going to help Bill Clinton be the centrist new 
Democrat he promised to be," Riggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider myself in lockstep with Bill Clinton," Hamburg said the 
morning after the first debate. "In fact, I think I represent a different wing 
of the party."

BRITAIN'S MAJOR HAILS N. IRELAND PEACE MOMENTUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The search for lasting peace in Northern Ireland has taken a "quantum leap 
forward," British Prime Minister John Major declared Saturday, a day after 
announcing that his government is ready to open talks with the IRA's political 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is now a momentum that will carry (the peace process) further," 
Major said, adding that he is "very encouraged" by the reception his proposals 
have gotten from Protestant and Catholic officials and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Those proposals include opening border crossings with the Republic of Ireland; 
allowing leaders of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, 
to travel freely in Britain, and recognizing the cease-fire being observed by 
Catholic and Protestant paramilitaries in the province. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Saturday, in the Republic of Ireland, police raided bases of suspected 
terrorists -- including IRA dissidents -- and arrested several people. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a warning shot across the bows of anyone tempted to turn back to 
terrorism," a senior security source said, according to the Irish news agency 
Ireland International. 
</P>
<P>
 After his announcement Friday, Major made a surprising symbolic gesture by 
dining at a Belfast restaurant with Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland 
secretary, and Mayhew's wife. He then spent the night at Hillsborough Castle -- 
the first prime minister to do so since the sectarian violence began 25 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Major visited the unionist city of Lisburn and met Britain's army 
commander and its police chief in Northern Ireland to discuss ways to get 
paramilitaries to turn in weapons and explosives.

MANY PROTESTANTS SKEPTICAL ABOUT ULSTER PEACE; NORTHERN IRELAND: THE WIDESPREAD 
FEAR AMONG NON-CATHOLICS IS OF BEING DOMINATED BY A RIVAL FAITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his office on Dublin Road, George Patton, head of the 80,000-member Orange 
Lodge, sounded a theme often heard within Northern Ireland's Protestant 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Protestants have been in Northern Ireland for close to 400 years, and we 
remain very much British in our hearts and minds," he said. "How long do you 
have to live in your place until you can call it home?" 
</P>
<P>
 "An American from West Virginia," he added, "may consider himself a West 
Virginian, but he is first an American. It's the same with the Protestant 
unionists in Northern Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 While Friday's announcement that Britain is ready to pursue talks with a wing 
of the Irish Republican Army drew widespread applause and raised hopes that 
peace is possible in Northern Ireland, many Protestants here remain wary. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing domination by the Republic of Ireland, which is predominantly 
Catholic, they still cite the Protestant Reformation as their lodestar and in 
some ways react much as American Protestants did in 1960 when considering the 
possibility of a Roman Catholic President. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a doubt, the 900,000-strong Protestant population here is central to 
ending the sectarian violence that has racked Northern Ireland for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The republicans argue that we are some kind of planters -- here temporarily 
-- and not entitled to our self-determination," David Ervine, leader of the 
Progressive Unionist Party, said. "I think it is pathetic that the republicans 
can't cope with the idea that we are British. . . . For all its ills, the 
United Kingdom is a liberal democracy and Northern Ireland is part of the U.K." 
</P>
<P>
 Protestant unionists insist on their constitutional right to 
self-determination, which, because they still hold a 57% majority in the six 
counties of Northern Ireland, means they would vote to remain part of the 
United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Catholic nationalists here -- and particularly the IRA and its 
political wing, Sinn Fein -- insist that any referendum on Northern Ireland's 
future include voters in the Republic of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 That impasse has worried Protestants, who believe the IRA would not have 
announced its Aug. 31 cease-fire unless it had received some secret assurances 
from the government of Prime Minister John Major. 
</P>
<P>
 The government denies this. But Protestant leaders like the Rev. Ian Paisley, 
head of the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party, and his deputy, Peter 
Robinson, won't accept Major's word that no secret deals have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 However, James Molyneaux, the moderate head of the Ulster Unionist Party, 
maintains that the British haven't made undercover agreements with the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a deep sense of distrust that has split the unionist leadership," a 
diplomatic observer here said. "There's a sense of being abandoned by the 
British, which leads to a siege mentality. It's doubly frustrating because they 
want to be British but feel the British don't want them. They are unionists not 
because of Britain but in spite of Britain." 
</P>
<P>
 The Protestant community in Northern Ireland has a long history of feeling 
betrayed by the British government. 
</P>
<P>
 Unionists point out that English and Scottish settlers were forcibly implanted 
in Northern Ireland in the early 17th Century. Most were strict Protestants, 
many Scottish Presbyterians, as opposed to the native Catholic inhabitants of 
Ireland. The Protestants set up churches that continue to operate today. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderate Protestants admit that Catholics in Northern Ireland were treated as 
inferiors for centuries, while unionists controlled the provincial government 
and economy. In that period, sharp divisions arose between the communities, 
with militant Protestants contending that union with Ireland would mean 
religious rule by the Catholic Church. This led Protestants to view Catholics 
as political subversives, which led to discrimination in jobs and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt about it," Ervine said, "the Catholics were second-class 
citizens. But those inequalities have been ended, from about 20 years ago. I 
would like to see a Northern Ireland society based on equality." 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine, like Patton, has been trying to reduce violence among Protestant 
paramilitary units, which operate under the Combined Loyalist Military Command. 
The units include the Ulster Defense Assn. and the offshoot Ulster Volunteer 
Fighters as well as the Ulster Volunteer Force. 
</P>
<P>
 They all recruit among Belfast's poor, youths with loyalist slogans tattooed 
on their arms and parents who buy infants' bibs inscribed "Proud to be a Baby 
Prod." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the persistent threat to peace posed by this martial tradition, many 
here think that the moderate Protestant cause is constantly undermined by 
extremist outbursts from Paisley, now 68, who calls Molyneaux, a fellow member 
of Parliament, a "Judas Iscariot," Major "a dictator" and the Pope "John Paul 
Antichrist." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, Paisley's even more radical deputy, calls not so much for "no 
surrender" as for "on to victory." Of any settlement that would put Northern 
Ireland under southern control, Robinson says: "No politician will be able to 
keep the lid on the situation. It will be not the paramilitaries but the whole 
community which will rise up and defeat the pan-nationalists." 
</P>
<P>
 As one official here put it: "Paisley has led his followers up and down the 
hill many times. But Robinson is capable of taking them into the abyss." 
</P>
<P>
 However, some unionists believe the Paisley-Robinson star may be waning unless 
the IRA renounces its cease-fire and violence erupts again. Protestants have 
also been somewhat reassured by recent visits by Major, during which he 
repeated British support of Northern Ireland's self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Major also agreed that inhabitants of Northern Ireland could hold a referendum 
on any agreements made in future all-Irish negotiations among the political 
parties and officials in London and Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
 But Protestant skeptics wonder what the IRA position will be if there is no 
all-Ireland referendum to determine the province's future. 
</P>
<P>
 One British official said, "Most Protestants view the situation as a zero-sum 
game: What is good for the Catholics is bad for the Protestants and vice 
versa." 
</P>
<P>
 But Molyneaux said: "We ought to have confidence in ourselves. Our best 
guarantee for our future is in the greater number of people making up their 
minds (at) a ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers suggest that demographics in Northern Ireland, where Catholics 
have the higher birthrate, will eventually favor republicans in any free 
election to determine future rule. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ervine disagrees. "Many middle-class Catholics, the lawyers, doctors, 
businessmen, prefer to remain connected to the United Kingdom," he said. "They 
have a good life here, and in a united Ireland their taxes would go up sharply 
and their incomes would drop. It is incorrect to assume that all Catholics are 
republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might see the beginnings of trust developing between our communities," 
Ervine said. "I hope our peoples will face the necessity for change. We have 
too often relied on dreams. The unionists dream of returning to majority-ism, 
absolute rule. The republicans dream of a united Ireland. Somewhere between 
these two dreams lies reality."

S. KOREA MAY SHUFFLE CABINET AFTER BRIDGE DISASTER; 7 HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Korean President Kim Young Sam will likely carry out a major Cabinet 
reshuffle in response to public anger over the collapse of a Seoul bridge that 
killed at least 32 people, government sources said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization is expected to affect the prime minister, the construction 
minister and many other Cabinet officials, sources said. In South Korea, top 
officials are often held responsible for major accidents or scandals even when 
they are not directly involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Lee Yung Duk, who was appointed six months ago, has already 
offered to resign, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a day after the accident, Kim fired Seoul Mayor Lee Won Jong and 
ordered a police investigation that resulted in the arrest of seven Seoul city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Yo Yong Won, head of the city government's construction office responsible for 
maintaining the bridge, and six others in his department were charged with 
negligence and causing death, the Seoul district prosecutor's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the seven arrested had reported to the city government that 
there were no safety problems regarding the bridge, but they had failed to 
carry out statutory daily checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction office also did not perform repairs earlier this year after 
finding that steel girders supporting the bridge were badly corroded, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they believe that a 157-foot span of the bridge collapsed 
after rusted extension hinges broke under heavy loads. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said repairs to the bridge had been scheduled for Thursday but 
were postponed because of bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
 A large section of the bridge collapsed during Seoul's heavy morning rush hour 
Friday, sending a city bus, a police van and several cars plummeting into the 
Han River. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the number of victims may increase as rescuers search the 
river. Some bodies may have been swept away in the swift river currents, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, an opposition member of Parliament had warned that urgent repair 
work was necessary on 12 bridges in Seoul to avert disaster.GOVERNMENT REFORM

KYRGYZSTAN VOTES ON LEGISLATIVE CHANGES; ASIA: REFERENDUM IN FORMER SOVIET 
REPUBLIC IS EXPECTED TO BACK PRESIDENT. IT MAY WEAKEN DEMOCRACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN MacWILLIAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This mountainous republic has 4.2 million people, twice as many sheep and a 
reputation among approving Westerners as the most liberal of the five new 
Central Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, however, Kyrgyzstan held a referendum on constitutional changes 
that some observers think may lead it away from democracy and toward stronger 
presidential rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Official results were not available, but a turnout of better than 74% was 
thought to ensure that popular President Askar Akayev will win the "yes" vote 
he seeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a feature of our people," said Jenish Sasekbayev, a Bishkek computer 
specialist, after he cast his vote. "Even if he has no bread in his house, a 
Kyrgyz will say his government is good." 
</P>
<P>
 If the "yes" vote prevails, it will be partly a legacy from Soviet days, when 
voters knew what was expected of them. It will also mean a seal of approval for 
Akayev, a 49-year-old former math professor who has endeared himself to the 
West by moving his country quickly toward free-market reform but who has also 
dissolved his Parliament and shut down two newspapers that criticized him. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats point out that the referendum question contradicts Kyrgyzstan's new 
constitution -- signed by Akayev -- which says that only Parliament and the 
constitutional court can make constitutional changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why play with the system so that the president can control it?" said Nikolai 
Kokhanov, a Communist who edits the Pravda Kyrgyzstan newspaper. "The president 
used to say the constitution is democratic, and experts agreed. But after a 
year, the president decided to make changes in the constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the referendum will determine whether Kyrgyzstan should have a 
slimmed-down, professional Parliament to replace the old Soviet-era 
legislature, which Akayev disbanded in September. Voters were also asked 
whether important political decisions may in the future be decided by 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 The president's critics say he is trying to set up a system that will be 
easier for him to control. The two-house system he prefers would put a body of 
35 members in charge of day-to-day legislative work. A larger house of 70 
lawmakers would meet only occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 The government argues that a small, professional Parliament would be more 
efficient than the old legislature, whose unruly deputies were paralyzed by 
internal intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Akayev has called for new elections in December, but a majority of deputies 
said they will boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 Perched on the Tian Shan Mountains bordering western China, Kyrgyzstan boasts 
spectacular scenery. Its people were sheepherding nomads until Soviet 
authorities forced them into collective farms and towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy years of Soviet rule failed to erase their passion for wide open 
spaces. As soon as Moscow's rigid controls let up, the Kyrgyz returned to an 
open, informal style of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Akayev is the only Central Asian president who was never a Communist chief, 
and he has good relations with the International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank, which hope to spread his brand of "new thinking" in Central Asia. The IMF 
has approved a three-year loan of $140 million to Kyrgyzstan to support its 
economic and reform program until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The republic was badly hurt by the demise of the centralized Soviet economy, 
since most of its industries shipped in raw materials and sent finished 
products elsewhere in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Now these factories cannot get supplies, and many have closed down. Former 
Communist lawmakers often blame the resulting hardship on Akayev's policies, 
saying a free market helps only the rich.

 A 12-year-old boy shot himself to death after leaving a suicide note telling 
his parents to donate his organs, newspapers reported.His request followed 
publicity for an American couple who donated their 7-year-old son's organs 
after he was fatally wounded in a highway robbery in Italy. The 12-year-old

ARAFAT ORDERS AIDE TO BOYCOTT SIGNING OF ISRAEL-JORDAN PACT 
</P>

 Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Saturday ordered his foreign affairs chief 
to boycott the signing ceremony for the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty, a 
senior official said, while in Tel Aviv, about 5,000 Israeli opponents of Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's peace policies rallied at the site of a bus bombing 
that killed 22 people Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the weekly Cabinet meeting of his government in the Gaza Strip, Arafat 
ordered Farouk Kaddoumi, the PLO's foreign affairs chief, to turn down an 
invitation to the signing ceremony, a Palestinian official said on condition of 
anonymity. Arafat himself has not been invited to the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has called the treaty with Jordan an "outrageous infringement" of the 
agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The pact 
calls for negotiations on the final status of East Jerusalem, which the 
Palestinians want as their future capital. But the treaty with Jordan assures a 
special role for Jordan's King Hussein as guardian of the Muslim holy places 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan and Israel are scheduled to sign the treaty Wednesday in a ceremony to 
be attended by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 In his annual speech from the throne Saturday, Hussein told the Jordanian 
Parliament that Jordan "will never relinquish our religious responsibilities 
toward the holy sites under all circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel, which captured the eastern half of Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 
Middle East War, claims the city as its eternal, indivisible capital, but 
Jordan has continued to maintain the Islamic shrines. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen Palestinians gathered in East Jerusalem shouting, "No to King 
Hussein" and burning pictures of the Jordanian monarch. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd at the Saturday night Tel Aviv demonstration, which was organized by 
right-wing groups, filled Dizengoff Street shouting "Death to the Arabs," and 
memorial candles covered the pavement at the spot where 22 people died in the 
suicide bombing claimed by the Islamic extremist group Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators, some holding signs saying, "Rabin is a traitor," stood for a 
minute of silence and then heard opposition politicians call on the government 
to halt talks with Arafat aimed at expanding Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, angry Israelis tried to break up a demonstration on Dizengoff, 
Tel Aviv's main commercial thoroughfare, by left-wing groups calling for a 
continuation of peace efforts with the Palestinians.

BOSNIANS AGREE TO A PULLBACK NEAR CAPITAL, U.N. OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian government troops could begin withdrawing from a demilitarized zone 
Monday if U.N. peacekeepers help secure a key supply road often targeted by 
Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yasushi Akashi, the top U.N. official in the former Yugoslav federation, said 
Saturday that Muslim-led government troops will begin leaving the DMZ on 
Mt.Igman in exchange for U.N. guarantees of protection for the supply route 
over the mountain just southwest of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs have been firing regularly on commercial trucks and other 
vehicles using the twisting dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi, after daylong meetings with Bosnian Serb and Bosnian government 
officials, also said the rebel Serbs promised to end a blockade of U.N. fuel 
convoys and allow free movement for peacekeepers through their territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The blockade has reduced U.N. fuel supplies to critically low levels in 
Sarajevo and three Muslim enclaves surrounded by rebel Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the promises hold on both sides, they could ease spiraling tension between 
the United Nations and the warring parties. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200,000 people are missing or dead in the war, which broke out in April, 
1992, when Bosnian Serbs revolted against a vote by Bosnian Croats and Muslims 
to secede from Yugoslavia.

CREWS WORK TO COLLECT FUEL SPILLED INTO RIVER; BURNING OIL AIDS EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gooey crude oil and gasoline, some of it burning, stretched 20 miles down the 
flood-swollen San Jacinto River, keeping cleanup crews busy Saturday but 
hopeful of avoiding serious environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of nasty stuff," said Coast Guard Capt. Richard Ford, coordinator 
of the cleanup. "I am really hopeful that we will collect a lot of oil there 
today and we will see a substantial improvement in the next 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "This black oil, while it looks bad, has a very, very high evaporation rate. A 
lot of it has evaporated." 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated the cleanup would take at least a week if conditions remain 
favorable. The oil is easier to clean up when it clumps in long streams. 
</P>
<P>
 The continued burning of oil and other fuel leaking into the river from 
punctured pipelines also aided cleanup because less had to be contained with 
booms and vacuumed with skimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials said they believe debris on the river, overflowing after 
torrential rains earlier in the week, punctured the pipelines, spewing 
gasoline, diesel fuel and crude oil into the waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the National Transportation Safety Board reported a fifth broken 
pipeline. Officials initially believed it was leaking jet fuel but later said 
they were not sure. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaks first exploded into flames on the river on Thursday, sending 120 
people to hospitals and adding to the flood woes of southeast Texas, where 18 
lives have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires burned for 36 hours, went out briefly early Saturday, then 
reignited. Pools of gasoline and some oil were ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of the crude oil was a 20-inch-diameter line belonging to Texaco 
Inc. The company said the line had been idle for weeks but contained 2.1 
million gallons of crude in a 24-mile stretch between valve stations. It was 
unlikely the entire amount would spill, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Colonial Pipeline Co. fuel lines also ruptured, one spilling about 840,000 
gallons of unleaded gasoline into the river and another spilling about 420,000 
gallons of diesel fuel, said an NTSB investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Exxon lines also appear to be damaged. Inspectors hadn't determined if 
they were leaking.

EX-JUDGE WACHTLER'S EARLY RELEASE FROM HALFWAY HOUSE DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's former chief judge, serving time at a halfway house for 
harassment, was denied early release because he sneaked out to a charity 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sol Wachtler was forbidden from attending the $500-a-plate gathering, said 
Michael Guadagno, the assistant U.S. attorney in Newark, N.J. And Wachtler 
stayed out past his 8:30 p.m. curfew, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachtler, 64, has been confined to the halfway house on weeknights and at his 
Long Island home on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer denied Wachtler attended the event last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachtler's violation only delayed his release by a few days. He is scheduled 
to be freed Wednesday after serving 13 months for harassing his ex-lover and 
threatening to kidnap her daughter.

CANDIDATES LATCH ON TO WELFARE REFORM AS THEIR CONSERVATIVE TICKET TO CONGRESS; 
ELECTIONS: REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE USE THE ISSUE TO DEFINE THEMSELVES 
AS FOES OF GOVERNMENT. MORE DIVISIVE LEGISLATION COULD FOLLOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The image on the TV screen segues from grim stills of poor children to a 
lively scene inside a diner, where a man in a plaid shirt is telling customers 
about his plans to revolutionize a welfare system that has "literally paid our 
children to have children." 
</P>
<P>
 The speaker is Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate who 
is giving incumbent Democrat Edward M. Kennedy an unexpected run for his money 
in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans, Romney declares, are tired of expensive government programs that 
fail to deliver the goods. They are even more fed up with career politicians in 
Washington who are unwilling to overhaul or abolish ailing agencies and 
programs, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Romney portrays Kennedy, scion of the state's best-known political family and 
a 32-year Capitol Hill veteran, as a principal engineer of a welfare state that 
has eroded the work ethic and traditional values and has contributed to rising 
rates of out-of-wedlock births, criminal activity and substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The strident critique is not unique to Massachusetts. Across the country, 
conservative Democrats and Republicans are making welfare reform a central 
issue in House and Senate elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In the view of some analysts, the calls for radical reform could shift the 
center of debate when Congress takes up the issue next year. If elected, these 
analysts say, the welfare-bashers will arrive in Washington with an apparent 
mandate to enact a reform package that is broader, harsher and more divisive 
than President Clinton's pending initiative, which would require about one in 
three recipients to go to work after two years on the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed remedies offered by congressional challengers range from 
abolishing welfare altogether -- as suggested by Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara) as he seeks a Senate seat -- to turning the whole mess over to the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign-trail reformers say Clinton's plan is not strict enough, noting 
that only the youngest one-third of recipients would be subject to the work 
requirement. Even those whose proposals appear to differ only slightly from the 
President's employ rhetoric that suggests a much tougher stance toward welfare 
recipients and the federal bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign consultants say these candidates have seized on welfare reform as a 
defining issue because they believe that it clearly demonstrates their 
opposition to "government as usual" and their commitment to traditional 
American values. They also say that attacking the welfare system enables 
candidates to tap into the anti-government anger rampant among voters even more 
effectively than talking tough about crime. That's because welfare is seen as a 
federal problem, while crime is viewed more as a state and local issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare "is perceived as the quintessential example of how the federal 
government can take a well-intentioned program and really screw it up," said 
Barry Bennett, campaign director for GOP Senate candidate Mike Dewine in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dewine," Bennett said, "is talking about a welfare revolution. . . . There's 
going to be a big shake-up in Washington. There will be more reform than the 
President has called for." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons welfare reform resonates with the voters is that it is a 
'values' issue," said Greg Stevens, who has produced television ads for Romney, 
Dewine and other Republicans. "People are worried about the breakdown of the 
moral fabric of society. They don't like what the welfare system is doing to 
the country. Only they don't blame the people on welfare per se, they blame the 
politicians who say they're going to change the system and then get to 
Washington and do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The solution offered by Dewine, who currently serves as Ohio's lieutenant 
governor, is to simply hand over federal welfare funds to the states so they 
can overhaul the system as they see fit. "Our current welfare system is an 
anti-family welfare system," Dewine says in one campaign ad. "It keeps people 
poor, promotes illegitimacy and breaks up families. I intend to go to 
Washington and change that." 
</P>
<P>
 Some senior Clinton Administration officials and liberal lawmakers have 
expressed concern that a more conservative Congress could wind up enacting a 
welfare reform measure much more Draconian than the President's proposal. Their 
greatest fear is that a new law might simply cut off benefits after two years 
without ensuring that private- or public-sector jobs will be available to 
beneficiaries and that child care and other support services will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The political prospects of Clinton's approach dimmed this fall when the 
Administration's health care reform initiative died in Congress. Administration 
officials acknowledge that their welfare plan is predicated on passage of 
health care reform. Without it, the incentives they tried to build into the 
system to entice recipients into the work force are significantly weakened. For 
many people, leaving welfare would mean losing medical coverage in the absence 
of guaranteed health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's health care plan would have provided subsidized medical benefits to 
poor Americans. Most welfare recipients already receive free or low-cost health 
care under the Medicaid program. If going to work causes them pay a larger 
share of their medical expenses, many could conclude they will be better off by 
remaining unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the candidates who are pushing welfare reform in the current 
campaign are Republicans, at least eight of the 34 Democratic Senate hopefuls 
are targeting the issue in their televised campaign ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, including Dewine's opponent, Joel Hyatt, have selected welfare reform as 
a "top-tier" issue for TV ads, stump speeches and campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
 By talking tough about welfare, Hyatt is trying to avoid being tagged as a 
"big-spending" Democrat and demonstrate that his business credentials make him 
just as sensitive to the need for fiscal responsibility as Republicans are. 
Hyatt founded Hyatt Legal Services, which provides attorney services to 
middle-class clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do think it has worked for us," said Peter Harris, who is working on the 
Hyatt ad campaign. "It communicates the values of hard work. It's the social 
contract: Nobody should be a freeloader." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Hyatt is running behind Dewine in the polls. But his prospects appear 
to be improving, largely because of what one ad calls his "hardheaded approach 
to replace welfare with jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gaining on him," Harris said, "and if we win this, welfare reform will 
have been an important part of the victory." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal for Hyatt and other Democrats, Harris says, is to increase their 
credibility to the same level as Republicans, because welfare reform is 
traditionally considered a GOP issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave McCurdy, a Democratic House member from Oklahoma who is running for a 
vacant Senate seat, is shooting even higher. By stressing his efforts to enact 
a more conservative welfare reform measure than Clinton's proposal, McCurdy 
suggests that he would be an even more aggressive reformer than his Republican 
opponent. He presents himself as a different kind of Democrat, one who will 
deny government assistance checks to all non-citizens and those Americans who 
refuse to attend training programs or accept available jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up here in Yukon," McCurdy says in one TV spot as a U.S. 
flag flutters in the background, "my parents taught me to work hard, earn my 
own way and stand my ground and fight. That's why I'm fighting to change 
welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy is trying to distance himself from Clinton in his Senate campaign. He 
says many voters believe that the President has abandoned welfare reform, so 
stressing the issue in his campaign does not link him with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy's assessment reflects a bitter irony facing the White House. Clinton 
ran for President on a promise to "end welfare as we know it" and he also tried 
to characterize himself as a new kind of politician who would come to 
Washington and bring about change. But McCurdy and others say the measure 
Clinton ultimately delivered to Congress falls far short of his campaign 
pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare reform took a back seat to health care reform, anti-crime legislation 
and other congressional issues during the first two years of the 
Administration. The President introduced a welfare plan earlier this year but 
did not insist that Congress move on it. Key lawmakers have said the issue will 
be taken up in earnest early next year, but the shape of the legislation will 
be determined in part by the composition of the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare is a big issue in this year's gubernatorial races as well. The 
policies put in place by new state administrations could influence the federal 
debate. Governors represent a powerful lobbying bloc in Washington, and many 
states are already forging ahead with versions of welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its appeal to many congressional challengers, welfare reform has 
proved treacherous for at least one gubernatorial candidate. A television ad on 
behalf of Republican Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois featured a former welfare 
recipient who went on to become a nurse under a welfare-to-work program 
advocated by Edgar. While the ad was airing, campaign staffers learned that the 
woman had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter in the death of her 
boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 The slain man's grandmother, Ruby Deal, complained to the Chicago Sun-Times: 
"She stabbed him in the heart with an ice pick, and now she's parading on TV 
like she's somebody to look up to." 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar's campaign pulled the ad.

BUDGET MEMO LISTS TOUGH CHOICES FOR REDUCING DEFICIT; POLICY: OPTIONS SENT TO 
PRESIDENT INCLUDE RAISING TAXES, CUTTING BENEFITS. GOP ACCUSES WHITE HOUSE OF 
HYPOCRISY FOR ATTACKING IT OVER THE SAME ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN DEVROY, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White House Budget Director Alice Rivlin has outlined for President Clinton a 
broad range of options, including tax increases and cuts in programs such as 
Medicare and Social Security, that she said Clinton will have to choose among 
as he plots his fiscal -- and political -- course the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, smarting over Democratic criticism that their proposals for 
reducing the federal budget deficit would lead to cuts in Social Security and 
Medicare, are hoping to make political waves with the document. 
</P>
<P>
 The "illustrative" package of budget choices Rivlin presented to Clinton in 
the 11-page memo includes six paths, three of which keep the deficit on a 
downward track by such devices as capping Social Security for wealthier 
recipients, taxing benefits, limiting mortgage interest deductions or state and 
local tax deductions. All are politically explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials this weekend called the Oct. 3 memo "a catalogue" of 
"what's out there in the fiscal literature" that is unrelated to proposals 
Clinton might make. 
</P>
<P>
 But by outlining steep entitlement cuts and tax increases as possibilities, 
Rivlin's memo, titled "Big Choices," provides Republicans fuel for their 
charges that the White House is being hypocritical in attacking the Republicans 
for signing on to a "contract with America" to, among other things, balance the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo, including a Rivlin cover letter to Clinton, was leaked Friday to 
Republicans, who gave it to the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 William Kristol, the GOP strategist who heads Project for the Republican 
Future, said it was obtained from "a public-spirited senior Administration 
official" and reflects the "craven hypocrisy" of the White House charges that 
Republicans would slash Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 "The White House is, of course, perfectly within its rights to hold internal 
meetings to discuss various budget options," he said, "even including massive 
tax increases and Draconian entitlement cuts that Rivlin indicates might total 
as much as $719 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is cravenly hypocritical" is that at the same time they are "publicly 
and falsely accusing Republicans of plotting a similar assault on entitlements" 
they are discussing doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivlin, in an interview, said the memo, part of early budget planning, was 
prepared simply "to bring the President up to speed on the debate" and the 
options "are not necessarily our options." 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that no recommendations were made to Clinton in the proposals and 
said the memo was part of a "series of meetings on big issues out there." 
</P>
<P>
 White House senior adviser George Stephanopoulos and economic adviser Gene 
Sperling were more adamant in distancing Clinton from any of the options. 
Stephanopoulos called the memo a "catalogue" of the fiscal literature, 
unrelated to any direction Clinton might choose. Sperling said the memo 
contains items others outside the Administration are proposing that Clinton 
"never in a million years" would propose. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta added his voice to 
the White House denials, stating that Clinton "has consistently rejected and he 
continues to reject any cuts in Social Security." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta also said Clinton would not cut Medicare except in the context of 
health care reform and said that cutting those programs are "proposals of our 
opponents," despite the Rivlin memo. 
</P>
<P>
 But believing the memo provides strong ammunition to Republican candidates 
being accused by their opponents of wanting to cut Social Security and 
Medicare, Kristol's group Saturday began faxing the memo around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivlin offers six illustrative packages that outline a range of paths the 
President could take, starting with the "current path" to retain the budget 
deficit at $168 billion during the next five years, a path that would require 
spending cuts and tax increases of $184 billion in aggregate. Making no changes 
in federal budget policy would result in a $235-billion deficit by the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Other paths would continue "modest" deficit reduction, "steeper" reduction or 
produce a balanced budget -- requiring $689 billion in cuts and tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The most audacious of the paths, and one that would produce a $211-billion 
deficit by 2000, outlines $719 billion in cuts and tax increases during five 
years, putting a chunk of new revenue into the "investment" spending Clinton 
touted as a candidate but has had difficulty producing because of the need to 
hold down the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Under some combinations, massive spending for Head Start, education, national 
service, training programs, welfare reform and other initiatives is included. 
Tax reductions for the middle class, such as increased exemptions for children, 
would be part of some paths. 
</P>
<P>
 The most politically volatile proposals, however, are those listed as 
"Restoring Confidence in Social Security" and "Balance the Budget and Increase 
Public Investment." 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Security system is projected to run out of money by 2013. The memo 
outlines a combination of cuts in cost-of-living adjustments, phased-in benefit 
reductions with a higher retirement age and higher payroll taxes. It would 
produce $25 billion to $75 billion in deficit reduction over five years, plus 
balance income and outgo from the Social Security system over 75 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option, the balanced-budget plan would require large "but progressive" 
tax increases, freezes on many items in the name of national sacrifice to "put 
the problem behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivlin's memo noted that the President's campaign theme this fall of moving 
the country forward while Republicans take it backward "must be translated into 
policy decisions soon after the election." The Republican "empty promises" must 
be met after the election with a Clinton program of "explicit and paid-for 
proposals."

AGAINST AN EXTREMIST IN PRISON FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER. AUTHORITIES HOPE ACTION 
WILL LEAD TO NAMES OF OTHERS.

<P>
 Signaling a mounting federal commitment to crack down on anti-abortion 
violence, the government will soon seek charges in connection with 10 separate 
attacks on abortion clinics in Northern California and elsewhere in the West, 
The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The central target of the expected charges is Rachelle Shannon, an 
anti-abortion extremist in prison for the attempted murder of an abortion 
doctor, according to government and non-government sources. The indictments, 
under consideration by federal grand juries in Sacramento and Portland, Ore., 
could come early this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments involve a series of fire-bombings and acid attacks on clinics 
in California, Oregon, Nevada and Idaho, sources familiar with the cases said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the government is not expected to seek indictments against any others 
at this time, sources said investigators hope the charges against Shannon will 
pressure her to reveal the names of other extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon is serving nearly 11 years in Kansas State Prison for the 1993 
attempted murder of Dr. George Tiller in Wichita. She was convicted March 25 of 
shooting Tiller as he drove out of his clinic on Aug. 19, 1993, wounding him in 
both arms. 
</P>
<P>
 She also was convicted of aggravated assault for pointing a gun at a clinic 
employee and was found in contempt of court for refusing to say where she 
obtained the weapon. At her sentencing, Shannon compared herself to Jesus and 
insisted she had done no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident is one of three shootings of abortion doctors that have occurred 
in the last two years, leaving two physicians and one clinic escort dead. 
Attacks at clinics across the nation prompted the passage of tough federal 
legislation against anti-abortion violence, and federal law enforcement 
agencies have stepped up efforts to investigate the possibility of conspiracies 
behind the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The expected charges will deal with three arson attacks on clinics in 
Sacramento and Redding and an incident at a Chico clinic, where a foul-smelling 
acid was used to disrupt the facility. All occurred in 1992. Attacks on clinics 
in Reno, Eugene, Ore., and Idaho are also involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon is a longtime anti-abortion activist and 38-year-old mother of two 
from Grants Pass, Ore. She has talked extensively in prison with agents of the 
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and has acknowledged certain 
incriminating information, sources familiar with the investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
 One source noted that Shannon's apparent cooperation came after she was 
confronted with some of the evidence ATF agents had gathered. But the source 
said agents at first were concerned she could have been admitting to attacks 
for which she had not been responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've heard of a boaster?" the source asked. "There's also the technique of 
copping out to some things you didn't really do" to try to protect those truly 
responsible. As a result, investigators conducted an extensive review of 
Shannon's statements, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Shannon's participation in clinic attacks was prompted 
largely by a treasure trove of evidence obtained after her arrest in the Tiller 
shooting, and by her statements and letters she wrote from jail about her 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 After her arrest, authorities searched her home and dug up materials in her 
back yard. Investigators obtained diaries and paraphernalia, including 
bomb-making materials and manuals, that seemed to provide a road map to her 
secret past. 
</P>
<P>
 Her diaries also revealed close ties to other extremists previously convicted 
of clinic attacks. Just weeks before she shot Tiller, for example, Shannon had 
traveled to Ohio to visit two anti-abortion leaders being held in different 
prisons on charges stemming from clinic bombings and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Both leaders openly advocate anti-abortion violence, and Shannon was an editor 
of a newsletter for one of their organizations. Her diary entries describe her 
prison meetings with them as "awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 An account of Shannon's life, which has emerged from court testimony, 
interviews and government sources, shows that by the time she shot the doctor, 
she had gradually let her life become consumed by the anti-abortion cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon's life in the anti-abortion movement began in 1988, when she began 
attending meetings of the Southern Oregon chapter of Right to Life. 
</P>
<P>
 But she quickly found Right to Life's emphasis on peaceful picketing and 
political lobbying stultifying. She said she was frustrated by its refusal to 
take direct action against abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon soon moved on to Operation Rescue, which used the tactics of 
nonviolent civil disobedience and street theater to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But ultimately her views moved beyond even Operation Rescue's nonviolent 
tactics, and she drifted into splinter groups that believed that violence aimed 
at stopping abortion was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 ATF agents have for months considered Shannon the prime suspect in the April, 
1992, fire at the Catalina Medical Center in Ashland, Ore. Last January, 
Shannon wrote to Chico police to confess to vandalism at a clinic there in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a letter she sent to a Wichita newspaper in February, Shannon 
acknowledged she was involved in a string of clinic arsons across the nation. 
"I figure at least six different states, several places in some states," 
Shannon wrote. "That's what I get for traveling hither and yon, doing this, 
that, and the other thing."

TOUGH JUDGE ASSAILS 'THREE STRIKES'; CRIME: JURIST COMBINES PERSPECTIVES OF THE 
PRAGMATIST AND THE HUMANIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If Superior Court Judge Arthur Jean Jr. owned a railroad, the trains would run 
on time. And on the bench in Long Beach, Jean's a near-fanatic about settling 
cases to keep the number of trials from overwhelming the available courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean also describes himself as a "voyeur into the human condition" who savors 
the uniqueness of each defendant, weaknesses as well as strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 It is both those perspectives -- that of the pragmatist and that of the 
humanist -- that have made him an outspoken opponent of California's tough new 
"three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 "My complaint with the 'three strikes' law as written . . . is that it seems 
to snare a passel of ne'er-do-wells, lightweight offenders, petty thieves and 
that ilk, for which the sentences are utterly Draconian," he said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he argues, it is simply unworkable. The law multiplies the number 
of cases that go to trial because the long prison sentences prescribed for 
third- and even second-time felons mean that defendants are not likely to plead 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plain fact of the matter is that every month . . . we get in Municipal 
Court about 400 new felony complaints," said Jean, who is responsible for 
scheduling criminal trials in the Long Beach courthouse. Only 25 to 30 of those 
complaints can go to trial without adding to the backlog of cases. The others 
have to be settled through plea bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, he said, the growing number of pending criminal cases in Long Beach 
is forcing a rearrangement of courtrooms. Starting tomorrow two of four civil 
court judges will be assigned to handle only criminal matters. Eventually, he 
said, all civil trials will be delayed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean said Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti could ease the situation if he were more 
flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 "What bothers me most of all is that the D.A. says it is . . . a poorly 
drafted law . . . and he implies it has bad consequences, and yet he appears to 
be going full bore after every possible 'three strikes' case," Jean said. 
</P>
<P>
 A prosecutor for 14 years before his appointment to the bench by a 
law-and-order Republican, Gov. George Deukmejian, Jean is generally seen as a 
tough sentencer who has little sympathy for repeat offenders. He also has 
little sympathy for lawyers, or cases, that he believes are wasting time. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old Jean, who was educated at Harvard Law School, said the 
shoplifting case of Calvin Bailey was just such a case. Jean assailed the 
deputy district attorney in the Bailey case, sarcastically asking him if he was 
"proud" of what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he could not go along with the "terrible, inhumane and unjust" 
sentence of life in prison for Bailey, who had been convicted of two robberies 
in 1986. He gave the man seven years in prison; Garcetti's office is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean is no stranger to confrontation. In 1988, he also was at odds with 
Garcetti, then the No. 2 man in the district attorney's office, over the 
judge's method for clearing out a court-clogging glut of minor drug cases in 
Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 To make room for trials involving more serious crimes, Jean was offering minor 
drug offenders 90 days in jail if they pleaded guilty. Garcetti ordered 
prosecutors to have Jean removed as the judge in all such cases because office 
policy was to require minimum sentences of 180 days. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Jean released on probation many people with otherwise clean records 
who were charged with looting during the riots that followed the first Rodney 
King beating trial. That ran counter to then-Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner's demand 
for minimum sentences of at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as now, Jean's motivation was part practical, part philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to understand that people are different, they do things for 
different motivations, and they have different possibilities in their lives," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, "I have to balance justice with the financial and legal 
means I have at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the day, we have to make it work."

'3 STRIKES' CASE LENIENCY IS OUT IN O.C.; COURTS: PROSECUTORS TIGHTEN UP POLICY 
OF SOMETIMES IGNORING PRIOR CONVICTIONS IF LATEST CRIME WASN'T VIOLENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A petty thief with a long criminal history, Jesus A. Martinez was arrested in 
July at a Fullerton HomeBase, a wrench, some pliers and a pair of vice grips 
tucked in his waistband, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the items allegedly stolen: $42.52. But if prosecutors have their 
way, it will cost the 44-year-old man much, much more. Possibly the rest of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is among the first 94 defendants charged in Orange County under 
"three strikes" legislation, a new law that aims to punish repeat offenders 
with lengthier prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 If found guilty at trial next month, Martinez, who has prior convictions for 
assault with a deadly weapon and burglary, faces 25 years to life in prison -- 
a harsher sentence than some murderers get. 
</P>
<P>
 The new sentencing law is the legacy of Polly Klaas, a Petaluma 12-year-old 
who was kidnaped and murdered late last year, authorities contend, by a newly 
paroled career criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 The case sparked a public outcry over the criminal justice system's seeming 
inability to keep habitual offenders behind bars, and prompted the state 
Legislature to resurrect a bill that mandates life sentences for third-time 
felons who have two or more convictions for serious or violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Promising it would help make California residents safer from violent 
criminals, Gov. Pete Wilson signed the bill in March, and an initiative -- 
Proposition 184 -- on the November general election ballot seeks to make "three 
strikes" part of the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, however, the new law has thus far ensnared mainly drug users 
and burglars, underscoring the complaints of critics who say that the law 
targets the wrong defendants, threatens to create a logjam in the courts and 
will possibly bankrupt the state by forcing an unprecedented prison-building 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 94 men and women charged under the new law, fewer than 20 face new 
felony charges for crimes of violence, according to a list of "three strikes" 
defendants compiled by the Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County's cases also illustrate the argument advanced by supporters 
of the law: The majority of the defendants have prior convictions for crimes 
involving force or fear or face a third "strike" for a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The full impact of the legislation has not yet been felt in Orange County, 
where only two defendants have been convicted and await sentencing under the 
new law. 
</P>
<P>
 But a 35% to 50% increase in jury trials scheduled for Superior Court this 
year has been attributed largely to the new law, and some fear that "three 
strikes" ultimately could cost Orange County taxpayers millions of dollars in 
expanded jail space, additional jury trials, more intensive investigation by 
law enforcement and other services. The public defender's office has already 
asked the county for $576,000 to handle the fallout. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, some "three strikes" defendants have found an unlikely ally 
-- the Orange County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparing felony complaints against 10 of the 94 "three strikes" defendants 
charged so far, prosecutors have simply ignored one of the two prior 
convictions of the defendants, making them second- instead of third-strikers, 
and effectively sparing them the threat of a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who benefited from this prosecutorial mercy had violent backgrounds, such 
as South County ex-convict Michael Marano, who once robbed a 71-year-old woman 
at knifepoint and was charged with battering his own mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Jan Nolan said prosecutors have since tightened up their 
policies regarding "three strikes" cases, and she acknowledged that prosecutors 
should have sought the harshest punishment against Marano. Nolan blamed the 
error on a gradually evolving policy, but noted that such discretion has been 
used in only about 10% of the "three strikes" cases. 
</P>
<P>
 As did the often-ignored 1982 habitual offender statute, the new law counts as 
"strikes" prior convictions for certain serious or violent crimes, ranging from 
residential burglary to murder. Defendants with one "strike" against them face 
prison terms for their most recent felony that are double the ordinary minimum 
sentences. And those with two "strikes" face 25 years to life in prison when 
convicted of a third felony -- any felony, even petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 94 men and women charged under the new law, only 18 face new felony 
charges for crimes of violence involving force or fear. Eleven of those 18 
defendants are accused of robberies, and the remaining seven have been charged 
with crimes ranging from assault to sex crimes to making threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 76 defendants were charged with nonviolent felonies: 34 for 
drugs, 22 for burglaries and the rest for crimes including petty theft, 
receiving stolen property, illegal firearms possession and forgery. But 50 of 
these 76 have prior "strikes" for violent crimes. One was convicted of murder 
in Los Angeles in 1975, two have prior convictions for voluntary manslaughter, 
and the rest have have been convicted of a range of crimes that include 
kidnaping, robbery and sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 To supporters of the new law, such numbers are evidence that it is ensnaring 
violent, hard-core criminals, who have repeatedly demonstrated their intent to 
continue breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can just look at the charge the guy is facing now. You have 
to look at his background," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Jacobs, who 
compiles "three strikes" statistics for the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan said prosecutors were still trying to grapple with how the new law would 
be applied when the Felony Evaluation Committee -- a panel of high-ranking 
prosecutors who review felony cases -- decided not to seek the harshest 
sentences against at least 10 of the "three strikes" candidates because their 
newest cases were relatively minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of them faced drug charges, and one was charged with stealing a paint 
sprayer that was later returned, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Nolan concedes that, in hindsight, Michael Marano seems an unlikely 
candidate for a prosecutorial reprieve. "I can tell you unequivocally, that 
now, that case would not again be filed as a 'two strikes' case," Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen, Marano, who is now 29, was charged with assaulting his mother. At 
age 20, he robbed a 71-year-old convenience store clerk at knifepoint while she 
begged for her life, and then went on to help a co-defendant rob a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 He was still on parole for those 1985 convictions when he embarked on a crime 
spree that included a bank heist, holding up the same gas station twice and 
stealing $400 from a former neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 On parole for the second spate of crimes, he was arrested in Dana Point in May 
for smoking marijuana and possessing methamphetamines for sale, making him 
eligible for 25 years to life in prison. But prosecutors used their discretion 
to ignore one of Marano's prior convictions, and Marano has since been 
sentenced to four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan said the district attorney's policy has since changed to more closely 
reflect the intent of the law -- to get repeat offenders off the street, 
regardless of the latest charge on which they have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be very stringent (now) in what we knock down" or reduce, 
Nolan said. "Instead of the (current) crime, the background is going to weigh 
more heavily." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys contend that the district attorney's evolving policy about 
how to apply the "three strikes" law has already resulted in unequal justice. 
Take these two unrelated cases, both titled People vs. Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 John Garcia was arrested in May on felony charges of possessing cocaine and 
heroin, and misdemeanor charges involving possession of a hypodermic syringe. 
Court records show that Garcia has been convicted of four burglaries and a 
robbery since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors reviewing his background and the pending case against him 
agreed to "strike a strike," as the process is referred to in legal circles. 
Garcia, 32, entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors and was sentenced to 
32 months in prison, according to court records and prosecutors' own data. 
</P>
<P>
 David John Garcia, in the other case, should be so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 David Garcia, 31, also was arrested for possessing heroin. And according to 
documents filed by prosecutors, he has three prior burglary convictions and one 
prior conviction for receiving stolen property. Yet prosecutors are seeking a 
25-years-to-life sentence in his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't understand how they decided one should be a 'three strikes' 
case, and the other shouldn't," said Deputy Public Defender Joel Garson, who 
was appointed to represent both Garcias. "One of the purposes of our legal 
system is to make sure laws are applied equally and there is uniformity in 
sentencing. I don't see that happening here." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Rimmer, executive director of the citizen group that placed the "three 
strikes" initiative on the November ballot, said prosecutors should use their 
discretion to waive a prior "strike" only in "very rare" cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the district attorney does not use that discretion wisely, it is up to 
society to replace him with someone that will," Rimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who is campaigning for reelection 
and an ardent supporter of "three strikes," said he too believes "three 
strikes" charges should be filed in almost every case possible. But Pringle 
said he believes Orange County prosecutors are doing their best with a new law 
and using their discretion wisely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any felony is minor, so I believe they all should be filed as 
'three strikes,' " Pringle said. "But I trust our prosecutors in Orange County 
to make the right calls. I would not second-guess that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a legal debate is raging over whether judges have the same 
discretion to ignore prior convictions -- a debate that can only be settled by 
a higher court. But some judges say they feel trapped in a Catch-22 situation. 
Prosecutors are filing "three strikes" charges in nearly all cases -- a 
practice that protects them from criticism and shifts the burden of dispensing 
justice to judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants to be seen as being soft on crime. But clearly, there are people 
being charged who do not deserve 25 years to life in prison," said one judge, 
who spoke on condition that he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 In a handful of cases, some Orange County judges have acted to spare 
defendants a life sentence by ignoring a prior conviction or reducing a felony 
charge to a misdemeanor, which means the defendant cannot be sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Anthony J. Rackauckas Jr. recently reduced 
a felony check fraud charge to a misdemeanor in the case of a man with two 
prior burglary convictions. Prosecutors may appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 West Orange County Municipal Court Judge Dan C. Dutcher ruled a few months ago 
that prosecutors had insufficient evidence to prove a felony stalking charge. 
The man was ultimately convicted of misdemeanor spousal abuse and sentenced to 
jail, and Dutcher's opponent in the upcoming election has criticized the 
judge's action in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair," Dutcher said of the criticism. "But we are elected to the 
bench to make difficult decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Only two people have been convicted so far of charges that could put them away 
for life -- a twice-convicted burglar who struck out when he stole a car, and a 
twice-convicted robber and prostitute who was caught with cocaine in a motel 
room. Both await sentencing and it remains to be seen whether judges in those 
cases will mete out the harsh punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Orange County Superior Court judges were reluctant to air their private 
views on "three strikes" legislation. Some said privately they would not 
hesitate to strike down enforcement of the law if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, such as Orange County Superior Court Judge James A. Jackman, say 
they believe their hands are tied by the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cases involving some guy who breaks into a woman's house and rapes her, 
someone who preys on small children -- those cases aren't difficult," Jackman 
said. "I live in fear of sentencing someone to (25 years to life in prison) for 
much less." 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Orange County Superior Court Judge James L. Smith said it will 
probably be months before the full impact of the law can be calculated. But he 
said criminal trials are already up 35% to 40%, an increase he attributes at 
least in part to the "three strikes" legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 While most cases in the criminal justice system are resolved through plea 
negotiations, defendants are beginning to show a reluctance to enter guilty 
pleas, lest they rack up a first or second "strike." In "third-strike" cases, 
they feel they might as well roll the dice on a jury trial, since there is 
always a chance of winning an acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say all of these defendants will demand a trial," Smith said. "If 
they have nothing to lose, why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 During 1993, there were 321 jury and non-jury trials held in Orange County 
Superior Court. During the first seven months of the year, 201 trials were 
held, which means the monthly trial average is already rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan said she believes trial settings are soaring even higher, near the 50% 
mark. She said her office is starting to feel the crunch and the growing 
caseloads have meant that even high-ranking prosecutors -- herself included -- 
will be handling "three strikes" cases in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have more cases, but we don't have any more prosecutors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he has a contingency plan in place, and is prepared to order civil 
court judges to switch to criminal cases if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 But judges like John J. Ryan say they do not anticipate a crisis situation. 
Many of the cases will involve trials lasting only two or three days, and he 
and other judges are prepared to handle back-to-back trials as long as it 
takes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the law and we are here to make sure it is carried out," Ryan said. 
"Three Strikes" File 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson in March signed emergency legislation that sends repeat 
criminals to prison for 25 years to life -- a harsher sentence than some 
murderers face. The law is also on the November ballot. Some facts about the 
first 94 cases filed in Orange County: 
</P>
<P>
 * Convicted "three strikes" defendants: 2 
</P>
<P>
 * Defendants facing two "three strikes" cases: 1 
</P>
<P>
 * Those whose alleged third "strike" involved force or fear: 18 
</P>
<P>
 * Defendants with prior convictions including murder or voluntary 
manslaughter: 3 
</P>
<P>
 * Those whose prior convictions included crimes of violence or threat of 
violence: 50 
</P>
<P>
 * Those who allegedly struck out with a drug charge: 34 
</P>
<P>
 * Those who allegedly struck out with a burglary charge: 22

THE SUBURBAN NIGHTMARE; WHILE OLDER SUBURBS EXPERIENCE MANY PROBLEMS OF THE 
INNER CITY, 'EDGE CITIES' NOW OFFER A NEW ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DAVIS, Mike Davis is the author of City of Quartz: Excavating the 
Future of Los Angeles (Routledge, Chapman & Hill). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, a placid town basked in the golden glow of its orchards. In 
the 1920s, it was renowned as the "Queen of the Citrus Belt." In the 1940s, it 
served as one of Hollywood's models for Andy Hardy's hometown. In the 1950s, it 
became a commuter suburb for thousands of Father-Knows-Bests in their starched 
white shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, its nearly abandoned downtown is surrounded by acres of vacant lots and 
derelict homes. Its major employer, an aerospace corporation, pulled up stakes 
and moved to Tucson. The 4-H Club has been replaced by local franchises of the 
Crips and Bloods. Since 1970, nearly 1% of its population has been murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 This town is, of course, Pomona, Los Angeles County's fourth largest city. 
Although geographically a suburb, Pomona now displays pathologies typically 
associated with a battered inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 Its incidence of poverty, for example, exceeds Los Angeles' and its murder 
rate, in bad years, approaches Detroit's. Its density of gang membership, as a 
percentage of the teen-age male population, is one of the nation's highest. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Pomona is not unique. Across the nation, hundreds of aging 
suburbs are trapped in the same downward trajectory, from garden city to 
crabgrass slum. This silent, pervasive crisis dominates the political middle 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 But the arrival of a second urban crisis -- potentially comparable in 
magnitude to the endless ordeal of American center cities -- does not fit 
comfortably into either political party's current agenda. Although urbanists 
and local government types have been screaming at the top of their lungs for 
several years about the rising distress "in the inner metropolitan ring," most 
politicos have kept their heads buried deep in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of candidates to address, or even grasp, the acuity of the 
suburban malaise explains, in turn, much of the populist rage that currently 
threatens the two-party status quo. America seems to be unraveling in its 
traditional moral center: suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the 1990 census confirms that 35% of suburban cities have experienced 
significant declines in median household income since 1980. These downward 
income trends track, in turn, the catastrophic loss of several million jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, formerly bedrock "family-value" towns like Parma, Ohio (outside 
Cleveland), Brockton, Mass. (outside Boston), or University City, Mo. (outside 
St. Louis) are experiencing the social destabilization that follows the 
relentless erosion of job and tax resources. 
</P>
<P>
 As the National Journal tried to warn policy-makers last year, "older 
working-class suburbs are starting to fall into the same abyss of disinvestment 
that their center cities did years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, of course, suburban decline is not necessarily a slow 
bleed. Recent aerospace and defense closures -- like Hughes Missile Divisions' 
abrupt departure from Pomona, or Lockheed's abandonment of its huge Burbank 
complex -- have had the traumatic impact of natural disasters. Following the 
Lockheed shutdown, for example, welfare caseloads in eastern San Fernando 
Valley soared by 80,000 in an 18-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 But older suburbs' losses are usually someone else's gain. Just as the 
inner-ring suburbs once stole jobs and tax revenues from central cities, so now 
their pockets are being picked, in turn, by the new urban centers -- farther 
out on the spiral arms of the metropolitan galaxy -- that Joel Garreau calls 
"edge cities." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been estimated, for example, that the inner-ring suburbs of 
Minneapolis-St. Paul lost 40% of their jobs during the 1980s to the so-called 
"Fertile Crescent" of edge cities on the metro-region's southwest flank. 
Outside Chicago, Schaumburg and central DuPage County -- west of O'Hare 
International Airport -- have had similarly adverse effects on the older 
suburban communities of Cook County, as have the young edge cities of Contra 
Costa County on the East Bay's traditional blue-collar suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer at hand, the 18-mile-long tape-worm-shaped City of Industry puts a 
bizarre spin on the idea of the predatory edge city. This special-interest 
"phantom city" (population, 680) monopolizes most of the tax assets of the 
southern San Gabriel Valley -- including 2,000 factories, warehouse and 
discount outlets, as well as a first-class golf course and resort hotel. Its 
malign influence on surrounding, tax-starved suburbs like La Puente and South 
El Monte has been compared to an economic atom bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-sided competition between old and new suburbs has exploded latent 
class divisions in the historic commuter belts. Southern California, in 
particular, has become an unstable mosaic of such polarizations. Think of the 
widening socioeconomic divides between northern and southern Orange County, the 
upper and lowers tiers of the San Gabriel Valley, the east and west sides of 
the San Fernando Valley or the San Fernando Valley as a whole and its 
"suburbs-of-a-suburb" -- like Simi Valley and Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The have-not suburbs, moreover, have accelerated their decline by squandering 
scarce tax resources in zero-sum competitions for new investment. A decade ago, 
every aging 'burb from Compton to Pomona had to have its own auto mall; now the 
magic bullet is believed to be a card casino -- and both Compton and Pomona are 
scheming to build one. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the dramatic hemorrhage of jobs and capital over the last 
decade, baby-boom suburbia also suffers from what might be called "premature 
physical obsolescence." Much of what has been built in the postwar period -- 
and continues to be built -- is throwaway architecture, with a 30-year, or 
less, functional life span. It is ill-suited to support the intergenerational 
continuity of community or property. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of units of this disposable, ticky-tacky stuff are beginning to erode 
into the slum housing of the year 2000. The Ur-suburb of Los Angeles, the San 
Fernando Valley, provides a telling example. The colossal damage inflicted by 
the Northridge earthquake (a "moderate" trembler on the Richter scale) exposed 
some of the submerged bulk of this building-quality crisis as residents were 
literally killed by shoddy construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one has yet attempted the calculation, there is little reason to 
suppose this suburban "housing deficit" -- the replacement cost of obsolete and 
unrestorable building stock -- will be any smaller than President Bill 
Clinton's now forgotten "infrastructure deficit." Nor is it likely, as 
declining suburbs become the new pariahs, that the free market's invisible hand 
will linger longer than it takes to draw a fatal red line around their 
prospects for housing reinvestment. 
</P>
<P>
 All this, of course, is especially bad news for poor, inner-city residents who 
are being urged by every pundit in the land to find their salvation in the 
suburbs. Indeed, confronted with virtually Paleolithic conditions of life in 
collapsing city neighborhoods, hundreds of thousands of blacks and Latinos are 
finally finding it possible to move into the subdivisions where Beaver Cleaver 
and Ricky Nelson used to live. 
</P>
<P>
 But their experiences too often repeat the heartbreak and disillusionment of 
the original migrations to the central cities. What seemed from afar a promised 
land is, at closer sight, scorched earth. Like a maddening mirage, jobs and 
good schools are still a horizon away. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the stranded and forgotten white populations of these 
transitional communities are too easily tempted to confuse structural decay 
with the sudden presence of neighbors of color. In the absence of any serious 
reform vision, one of the most worrying prospects is that new-wave racism -- 
even some viral mutation of fascism -- may yet grow limbs of steel in the ruins 
of the suburban dream.

FOR ARAFAT, HOBSON'S CHOICE AFTER HAMAS BUS BOMBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Geoffrey Kemp, Geoffrey Kemp, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for 
International Peace, served on the National Security Council staff as adviser 
on the Middle East during the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat shook hands with 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin at the White House on Sept. 13, 1993, he 
became a pariah to radicals in the Palestinian movement and many others in the 
Muslim world. In their view, Arafat had made a deal with the devil and -- like 
the traitor Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who made peace with Israel and was 
assassinated -- would also have to pay the ultimate price for his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with his control of Palestinian territory still restricted to the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho -- but with a Nobel Peace prize under his belt -- Arafat 
faces his most fateful choice: When and how should he crack down on the 
extremist movement, Hamas, that threatens to destroy the delicate Middle East 
peace? In the wake of last week's terrorist bombing in Tel Aviv -- in which 
more than 20 people were killed on a commuter bus on the busiest city street -- 
Arafat's options are grim indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, had to use lethal 
force in the early days of independence in 1948 to disarm Jewish extremist 
groups led by Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, Arafat has known that a 
showdown with Hamas was inevitable. But unlike Ben-Gurion, who controlled most 
of the military and police forces of the new Jewish state, Arafat controls 
little. 
</P>
<P>
 His preference would surely have been to wait for a showdown until his own 
Palestinian forces controlled most of the occupied West Bank. As of now, he has 
the worst of all worlds: no control or authority in the West Bank and around 
Jerusalem, where many Hamas supporters come from, yet held responsible by 
Israelis for Hamas terrorism. He thus is under great pressure from the 
government of Israel and the United States to apprehend Hamas supporters in 
Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 If he does so, as happened two weeks ago after the kidnaping of an Israeli 
soldier, Nachshon Waxman, he incurs the wrath of much of the Gaza population 
and is accused of being Israel's lackey. As it turned out, the kidnapers' 
hide-out was discovered near Jerusalem, two miles from the home of Waxman's 
parents. In the resulting shoot-out with Israeli forces, Waxman, another 
Israeli soldier, and three terrorists were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 With the kidnaping, Arafat could legitimately claim events were beyond his 
control. But this excuse will not work for long. Hamas headquarters are in 
Gaza, and, sooner or later, a terrorist event planned and coordinated from 
within his own enclave will occur, and he will have to act. In fact, it is 
certainly possible that Gaza-based Hamas members played a role in the string of 
recent attacks -- including the Tel Aviv bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the latest terrorism, anger among the Palestinians is 
bound to grow as Israel's Draconian, but politically necessary, crackdowns take 
their toll of daily life and add to the already harsh conditions in Gaza. 
Arafat will be the lightning rod for this frustration. If he fails to act 
against the radicals he could lose control of his enclave. At that point, 
anarchy or a return of Israeli forces may result. Either way, Hamas will have 
won: The peace process will be over or on indefinite hold. 
</P>
<P>
 What, then, can Arafat do? First, to satisfy Israel and the United States, he 
must be more outspoken in his condemnation of terrorism and stress his 
willingness to take whatever steps are necessary to contain it -- including 
asking for more help to strengthen his police and intelligence gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking action to curb the militant extremists is needed to lend credibility to 
Arafat's words. A crackdown on Hamas in Gaza, including disarmament, coupled 
with action Israel will take in the West Bank, is essential to put the 
terrorists on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat will argue that unless more Palestinian areas are brought under his 
control, his opposition to terrorism may ultimately prove counterproductive. He 
can also argue that he must have more money to pay for basic services, like 
police, and establish some modicum of stability and infrastructure, which is 
the prerequisite for the transfer of much larger amounts of money from the 
private sector. There has been an understandable reluctance on the part of the 
main donor countries and the World Bank to hand Arafat money until he has set 
up an acceptable accounting procedure. While such reform is highly desirable, 
in the short term, such niceties may be a luxury if the alternative is anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the constraints on Arafat's options would be less painful if 
elections could soon be held in the occupied territory, and the economic 
conditions of the local Palestinian population were seen to be improving. 
Hamas' appeal will begin to diminish once Arafat delivers on his promises of a 
better life for his people. 
</P>
<P>
 But how can Hamas be allowed to field candidates for electoral office as long 
as the organization's purpose -- as outlined in its charter -- is to reject the 
peace process, deny Israel's legitimacy and call for a holy war against 
infidels? Just as Israel outlaws racist groups, such as Kach, so the 
Palestinians must force Hamas to abandon its charter if it wishes to 
participate in elections. Arafat has to use his power to try to divide and 
weaken Hamas. He must be certain that, if a reformed Hamas participates in 
elections, it will abandon all calls for violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Some will argue that this logic will perpetuate Arafat's authoritarian and 
increasingly unpopular rule by fiat. But the alternative, giving more 
legitimacy to Hamas, would be unacceptable to most Israelis and reverse all the 
progress of the last year in Israeli-Palestinian relations.

A POST-MODERNIST CALIFORNIA IS BORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Starr, Kevin Starr, a contributing editor to Opinion, is the State 
Librarian of California and a member of the faculty at USC. The newest volume 
in his history of California, The Dream Endures: California Through the Great 
Depression, will be published by Oxford University Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the minimalist mid-1990s -- so fraught with peril and an odd, defiant kind 
of hope -- emerges the necessity of deliberate choice, of making California 
happen once again, as a matter of vision and will. Like the pioneers of the 
mid-19th Century, like the Californians of the Depression era, today's 
challenge is reassembling, renewing and re-earning the commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, California might have glistened on the shores of the Pacific as 
an assured utopia: a place of unrivaled beauty and economic opportunity, where 
daily life could be better -- much better -- for ordinary Americans. This 
notion had deep historical roots and resulted in the development of California 
through a sequence of booms, from the Gold Rush to the post-World War II 
economic explosion. What drove Americans and then, increasingly from the 1960s 
onward, non-Americans to choose California as their destined place? 
</P>
<P>
 When Crenner and Lee Bradley, African-Americans from Texas, arrived in Los 
Angeles in 1924, they found no easy increment. Crenner went to work as a maid, 
Lee found work as a Pullman porter on the Santa Fe. Yet, for all the 
difficulties the Bradley family faced, their son, Tom, a studious boy devoted 
to his brothers and sisters, gained admission to Polytechnic High School in 
1934 (one of 113 African-Americans among 1,300 students) and went on to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, people like the Bradleys believed they could do better in 
California, and, despite the apocalyptic musings of Nathanael West, most did. 
In 1849, they came to escape the confines and certainties of New England 
villages and small-town life in the Old South. In the 1880s, they came, like 
Harry Chandler, to recover from lung disease in the sunny climate. In the 
1920s, a generation of rural Midwesterners and Southwesterners, like the 
Bradleys, came to enjoy the benefits and amenities of suburban life: especially 
the chance to own a home. After World War II, millions came, delighted that 
they had survived the war. 
</P>
<P>
 They came to possess and repossess the American Dream in the biggest possible 
way. By 1948, Gov. Earl Warren was writing in the Saturday Evening Post that 
California would have to build millions of housing units, thousands of schools, 
and thousands and thousands of miles of roadways and freeways if it were to 
accommodate the millions of Americans pouring into the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 There were jobs aplenty, so many of them in defense-related industries, which, 
since 1941, had been providing a continuing steroid boost to the economy. 
Innumerable K-12 plants had sprung up since the school-building boom initiated 
by Warren in 1948. The Master Plan for Higher Education pushed through by Gov. 
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., in 1960, offered a menu of choices: academic and/or 
vocational training in junior colleges, a state college system exfoliating 
campuses across the commonwealth, a UC system pushing toward nine campuses. 
Developers were bringing on line millions of residential units, the vast 
majority of them within the economic reach of working Californians. A newly 
completed freeway system whizzed Californians to and from work with little 
delay, and, somewhere in the subliminal distance, the Beach Boys were always 
singing of a land of youth and leisure on the shores of the sundown sea. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easy then to become or to remain a Californian; indeed, California 
embodied what the 18th-Century Anglo-Irish parliamentarian and philosopher 
Edmund Burke called "the unbought grace of life" -- the gifts of beauty and 
abundance, which seemed to come at no cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime in late 1989 and early 1990, however, just as the Berlin Wall was 
disassembled, a tragic sense of life entered the California consciousness: a 
sense that boom times, the easy times, were yielding to an era of 
transformation and challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the tragic sense of life was previously absent from the consciousness 
of Californians. For Latino-Californians, resident in California since 1769, 
Americanization had its tragic dimension, especially the Land Act passed by the 
Yankees, which forced each Latino landowner to prove his or her title to 
ownership of property. Land lawyers prospered as Latino-Californians sold off 
their properties or bartered them away to pay their legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1850s, cholera could wipe out an entire wagon train. The Depression of 
1873 filled San Francisco with unemployed transients and rendered portions of 
the population homeless. The World War I era migration included many Japanese, 
who were forbidden by the alien land laws of 1913 and 1920 to own property. The 
agonies of the Dust Bowl migration speak for themselves. Yet, never did these 
sectors of suffering overwhelm the image of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The consciousness that arose some four to five years ago, by contrast, put the 
entire California Dream in question. Many non-Californians, ever envious of 
California's international notoriety as the American Dream writ large, pounced 
on any number of defaults, depressions or disturbances -- the agony of the 
defense industry after the collapse of the Cold War, the rise of ethnic 
antagonisms, especially as expressed in gang culture and behavior, the riots, 
looting and burning of 1992, the fires, the flood, the Northridge earthquake -- 
as proof positive that California was finished, kaput, road-kill, history. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the case. For amid all these difficulties, the economic and social 
fabric of California has begun to mend itself and gather new strength. 
California is doing this, however, having absorbed the tragic sense of life. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 years ago, the greatest philosophical mind ever to be produced 
by California, Josiah Royce, wrote that it was in the struggle for corrective 
action against human weakness, natural failures and tragic loss that 
Californians made connection with their best possible social and moral selves. 
California, Royce wrote, was not an escape from history, from tragic 
experience. California was, rather, a headlong plunge into the very promise and 
perils of America itself. Flaws, failures, tragedy constituted essential 
components of the California formula. Here was no unmitigated idyll, no 
brainless Eden. Here was the moral challenge of the American Republic -- only 
more so. 
</P>
<P>
 Never again, perhaps, will California experience the affluence, the easy times 
that extended through the 1980s. But will not the necessities of choice and 
action in hard times bring to California a certain depth, a resilience and 
tenacity of character that it somehow lost sight of in the decades of easy 
living? 
</P>
<P>
 This newly emergent post-modernist California, flawed but persistent in its 
corrective struggle, promises to be of even more importance to the larger 
American experiment than the easy-living California now receding into the 
distant past. After all, is not California, among other things, the prism 
through which America glimpses its unfolding identity? And is not that 
unfolding identity, like California, conditioned by new peoples and a scarcity 
of resources? 
</P>
<P>
 The ancient Greeks believed that scarcity and fate were one and the same. Only 
when one chose amid narrow options, the Greeks believed -- indeed, chose to do 
that which must be done -- was one truly free. In re-earning California, in 
reassembling and revitalizing the embattled California Dream, Californians will 
create for themselves a commonwealth, ecumenical and energized by hope, that 
will once again, in completely new circumstances, help renew the larger 
American experiment.

THE END OF THE KOHL ERA HAS BEGUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Henry A. Kissinger, Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger frequently 
writes for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition has prevailed by the narrowest margin in 
Parliament since the first German national election after the war. This outcome 
will not by itself diminish his authority, since the Kohl coalition's real 
margin is greater than it appears. No current leader would accept becoming 
chancellor with the help of 30 former Communist Party members, who entered 
Parliament through a heretofore inoperative constitutional clause. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is precisely why the election is likely to be viewed in retrospect as 
an augury of impending upheaval in the German political landscape -- as the 
beginning of the end of the era of Kohl. At a minimum, Kohl's coalition 
partner, the liberal Free Democratic Party, will become increasingly fractious. 
It may even abandon the coalition altogether and switch sides by midterm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Democrats are having an identity crisis. They know they came close to 
failing to get the 5% of the total vote necessary to qualify for representation 
in Parliament. They may well have crossed that hurdle only because Kohl's party 
encouraged the switch of enough of its own votes to sustain the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Democrats seem to have reached the point that former Vice Chancellor 
and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher described to me in 1980, when his 
party had been allied with the Social Democrats for more than 10 years. He said 
his party would have to look for an opportunity to switch during the next 
electoral period because, if its voters became too accustomed to a permanent 
coalition with Social Democrats, they would lose interest in a separate 
existence and vote for Social Democrats directly. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar situation seems to have arisen today, though the current Free 
Democratic leader lacks the manipulative skill of his predecessor and would 
have to take into account the risk of a complete disintegration of his party if 
he tried to change coalitions. But self-interest will drive the Free Democrats 
toward greater assertiveness and, at an opportune moment, tempt them to switch 
coalitions. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Free Democrats join the Socialists and the Greens, the resulting 
coalition would be in a position to elect a new chancellor. Kohl's fourth term 
would be unprecedentedly precarious, and his government would require far 
greater effort than previously to pass its legislative program. In addition, 
his own party may be tempted into succession maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl had hinted strongly that, if elected, he might not serve more than two 
years and would hand over the remainder of his term to a successor of his own 
choosing. But after the recent election, such a move could trigger a shift in 
coalitions by giving the Free Democrats a pretext to reject the Christian 
Democratic Union's choice. On the other hand, if Kohl serves out the course, he 
will have an exhausting term as a prelude to fighting another bitter election 
battle with -- this time -- uncertain allies constantly reviewing whether they 
are more likely to reach 5% as the right wing of a Socialist-led coalition or 
as the left wing of a Christian Democratic one. 
</P>
<P>
 These are melancholy prospects, because Kohl is one of the seminal figures of 
our period. He has been a guarantee of Germany's Atlantic and European 
orientation and a shield against nationalistic or romantic temptations, from 
which his people have suffered through much of their modern history. This does 
not reflect a lack of confidence in Social Democrats, who proved their sense of 
responsibility under chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt. Since then, 
however, the party's radical wing has grown far more restless; its coalition 
party would be the Greens, whose formal program rejects the Atlantic Alliance 
and a major international role for Germany. The center of gravity of such a 
coalition would be much farther left and would make implementation of 
traditional Atlantic policy much more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 The approaching end of the Kohl era is due not only to electoral arithmetic 
but to the transition in generations. Kohl is the last West German leader with 
a living memory of World War II and its aftermath. The next generation, of all 
the parties, will be less tied to traditional interpretations, more cool-headed 
about assessing national interests and more inclined to assert a national 
German role. This will be reinforced by the growing influence of the formerly 
communist part of Germany, whose people did not experience the great period of 
Atlantic cooperation and European construction and who saw in nationalism a 
refuge from communist oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 These trends are compounded in the the post-Cold War world. When Germany was 
divided, Europe provided a political home and a substitute for a national 
policy. So long as German armies stood on the Elbe, the Atlantic Alliance was 
essential for German security. Germany's unification removes one incentive for 
subordination to supranational institutions; the retreat of Russian forces from 
Central Europe eliminates another. Meantime, there has been no U.S. initiative 
to define new purposes for the Atlantic Alliance other than the Partnership for 
Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 For the United States, the approaching end of the Kohl period represents a 
watershed of its own: whether to continue emphasizing new universalist 
institutions, which may progressively weaken the Atlantic Alliance and change 
the nature of the European Union, or to revitalize the existing building blocks 
of the European order and the Atlantic Community. The Clinton Administration 
will not have time to pursue both approaches in partnership with Kohl; it must 
establish priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the time remaining, the United States must work with Kohl on defining 
membership in both the Atlantic Alliance and the European Union for the states 
of Eastern Europe, and on creating new but different structures for political 
consultation with the states arising out of the former Soviet Union. A clear 
sense of identity of the Atlantic Alliance and a clear definition of the 
European Union is a prerequisite to good relations with Russia. The reluctance 
to draw new lines means reliance on those made irrelevant by the end of the 
Cold War. Neither Europe nor the Atlantic Alliance can stop at the East German 
border without creating a vacuum between Germany and Russia -- the historic 
source of European wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Revitalizing European and Atlantic institutions would be a noble culmination 
of Kohl's stewardship. It is important, for whatever happens, the United States 
and Europe will not soon find so reliable and courageous a partner as Kohl.

BUILDING FROM BOTTOM UP: THE IMPORTANCE OF NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Leadership Studies at Loyola-Marymount University and author of Surviving Power 
(Free Press).

<P>
 In Chicago, neighborhood organization has moved into the streets: a gang has 
added a political portfolio to its operations. It is a frightening prospect, 
partly because it is so easy to see how this new enterprise might succeed. 
Gangs have ways of enforcing and rewarding consensus to achieve a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the Riordan Administration is trying to create a neighborhood 
structure with its new Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative. The project will 
spend $40 million to spruce up eight commercial neighborhoods located along 
public-transit routes. 
</P>
<P>
 We need neighborhood organizations, paradoxically enough, because large cities 
work only if there is a sense of belonging to a smaller community within them. 
That's one of the reasons why gangs work. But is Riordan's neighborhood 
initiative anything more than a cosmetic ploy at a time when we need genuine 
and serious experiments in community living? 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that the city's poorest neighborhoods were ethnically 
homogeneous. This was not just because they were made up of immigrants who had 
followed their families to the neighborhood. There were also restrictive 
covenants that barred them from settling in other parts of the city, especially 
if they were black, Mexican, Asian or Jewish. Yet, the perceived hostility of 
the outside world gave their community organizations a rough stability and 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, only East Los Angeles is a predominantly single-ethnic community. 
Virtually all other middle- and lower-class neighborhoods are ethnically 
diverse. And this diversity has made neighborhood consensus, and the 
institutions that grow out of it, a near-impossible dream. As a result, we 
struggle on our own, and as our neighborhoods change, more established 
community organizations typically find themselves supported by one ethnicity 
serving another -- a situation that can lead to conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that no neighborhood institution has replaced the 
all-inclusiveness and multipurposefulness of the party machine. Ward and 
precinct captains were the glue that held together coalitions of ethnic 
communities, produced consensus and tied people to politics. They created, 
among other things, a sense of neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious institutions, to some extent, have tried to fill the 
neighborhood-organization vacuum. They are increasingly providing, through 
covenants among churches and synagogues, the social services that used to be 
the daily bread of the machines. But except for Catholic parishes and 
storefront churches, most of the city's larger religious institutions are 
"gathering" institutions. Their membership comes together on Sunday, then 
scatters home to other neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 There are institutions that immigrant communities bring with them: family and 
village associations, for example. They play important roles in basic survival 
by providing immediate economic help and by offering people the opportunity to 
reaffirm identities and ties strained by new environments. But they usually 
don't connect their members to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The best "connectors" in the new communities are the social-service agencies 
staffed by second-generation immigrants who can articulate and lobby for the 
needs of their community to the larger city. These agency heads, however, are 
not traditional community leaders and, as such, are unable to "deliver" their 
communities to form coalitions with other groups, or create linkages between 
their constituents and the larger civic society. Over time, some of these 
groups may foster community activism, but probably of the kind most associated 
with block clubs, whose organizing purpose may be quite narrow -- getting an 
alley cleared, or getting neighbors to do it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative offers an opportunity to see how the 
communities most in need can learn to work together. It has several advantages: 
there is money to be dispensed, which tends to focus the mind; and it is a 
short-term project. Neighborhood advisory groups frequently fall apart over 
internal political struggles; the initiative has the resources to ease them 
through tensions, but each will have to listen carefully to make sure everyone 
is heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we need to learn more about what makes neighborhood organizations work 
in the communities they serve. In so doing, we may have to deliberately blur 
the line separating church and state, for example. We will always need leaders 
-- at the top and bottom of the social structure -- who can help us overcome 
our fears and see the dreams in other people's eyes. In the long term, that may 
require more than a neighborhood face lift.

CANDIDATES AIM FOR FATHER-SON ASSEMBLY TEAM; ELECTIONS: WITH A WIN IN THE 
HEAVILY DEMOCRATIC 47TH DISTRICT, WINDSOR HILLS LAWYER KEVIN MURRAY WOULD JOIN 
HIS DAD, WILLARD (D-PARAMOUNT), IN SACRAMENTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Confident of joining his father in the state Assembly after the November 
elections, Windsor Hills lawyer Kevin Murray is already looking ahead to rising 
to a leadership role in the political vacuum expected to result from term 
limits for legislative offices. 
</P>
<P>
 But first Murray will have to beat Republican challenger Jonathan Leonard and 
two minor-party candidates for the seat vacated by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore, 
who made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for Secretary of 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray has reason to be confident -- 75% of the 47th District's registered 
voters are Democrats. In the 1992 election, Leonard won only 14% of the vote 
against Moore's 81%. And this time around, Leonard does not appear to have the 
resources for an aggressive, districtwide campaign. He reported no campaign 
bankroll in his most recent finance statement, while Murray has reported 
raising $108,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent most of that in a tough, nine-candidate primary. With the help of his 
father, Assemblyman Willard Murray (D-Paramount), and supporters including 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, Murray beat primary opponents who included a 
candidate backed by the powerful political machine of Reps. Howard Berman 
(D-Panorama City) and Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 He had something else going for him, he says. He knows the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very important for me and my peer group, my friends, to run in an area 
where I grew up, where I rode my bike, where I had my first job," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47th District covers parts of Baldwin Hills, the Crenshaw district, Culver 
City, Palms and South-Central Los Angeles. Its heart is predominantly black, 
upper- and middle-income neighborhoods, and it also has less affluent areas and 
a significant Jewish population, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts consider the district a sure win for Democrats. Leonard acknowledges 
that his challenge is to persuade voters to look beyond the party labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get a lot of crossovers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Murray did not take a traditional career path for a politician. He 
said that unlike the African American politicians of a previous generation, 
many of whom came from the church and the civil rights struggle, his experience 
is in business. 
</P>
<P>
 While a talent agent for the William Morris Agency, he studied comparative 
Asian economic systems for his MBA and then studied law. He received his 
business degree in 1983 and his law degree in 1987, both from Loyola Marymount 
University. In 1989, he began working in entertainment law and as a children's 
court advocate.  
</P>
<P>
 At first, he said, his father was skeptical about his run for office. "He 
wanted to make sure that I really wanted to do it, and he wanted to make sure I 
had what it took," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 But his father eventually helped run the campaign, lined up support in 
Sacramento and put him on his slate mailer. Murray won 21% of the primary vote, 
four points ahead of Ed Johnson, an aide to U.S. Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los 
Angeles) who was backed by the Berman-Waxman machine, and teacher Jimmie Woods 
Gray. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard Murray said he expects to continue working closely with his son in 
Sacramento, where they would be the first father-son team in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can take credit for anything, I have more credit as a father who helped 
raise a person who developed into a fine citizen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They do have differences. Willard Murray said his son supports strict gun 
control, while he does not, and in general his son is more liberal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They're both hoping Kevin will rise to leadership roles in the Assembly. 
Because of term limits, one of the new Assembly members elected in November 
will be a speaker in six years. But "we're not looking that far ahead," Willard 
Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard, 63, a retired firefighter and lifelong resident of the area, said he 
believes he can appeal to Democratic voters with his ideas for improving 
education through increased community involvement and improving the economy 
with enterprise zones. 
</P>
<P>
 California's social problems, he said, cannot be resolved by the state's 
massive increase in prison construction. "We need to get jobs for this 
community," Leonard said. "Penitentiaries are not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The similarity of Murray's name to that of a third-party candidate in the 
race, Libertarian Kevin Murphy, could confuse some voters.  
</P>
<P>
 A supporter of a cautious approach to such Libertarian policies as 
legalization of drugs, Murphy, a computer programmer, said he hopes to show 
that voters will respond if the Libertarians target less controversial issues 
such as lower taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 The Peace and Freedom candidate in the race is Tamara Taleebah, a teacher. In 
the primary, both Murphy and Taleebah ran uncontested.

BUILDING ON THE PAST; A RECONSTRUCTED RELOCATION CAMP BARRACKS BECOMES A 
LEARNING EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA NGUYEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty years after World War II, Bacon Sakatani finds serenity in resurrecting 
a barracks -- one of hundreds at the internment camp where he and 10,000 other 
Japanese Americans were forced to live by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent, breezy Sunday morning, the West Covina resident and several 
volunteers from across the city sawed and hammered the three-unit barracks into 
shape after Sakatani and others brought the pieces back on flatbed trucks from 
the former camp in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 The barracks, across the street from the Japanese American National Museum in 
Little Tokyo, will be unveiled Nov. 11 as part of an exhibit called "America's 
Concentration Camp: Remember the Japanese American Experience." 
</P>
<P>
 For Sakatani, who was 13 when incarcerated with his family in 1942, the 
barracks will memorialize a painful wartime experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The barracks has taken out much of my anger," said the retired computer 
programmer. "I had a lot of anger before. But now I don't have to speak about 
it. They can just look at the barracks and understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing before his work, he said with a smile: "I am so proud of this. When I 
saw the walls up . . . it was the most exhilarating moment in my life. I was so 
relieved, as if the burden was off my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 During the war, the government ordered 120,000 Japanese Americans from the 
West Coast to evacuate their homes, abandon their jobs and relocate to camps 
throughout California, Arizona and interior states. The order was nullified 
when the war ended in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sakatani rode on a train bound for the Heart Mountain Camp in Wyoming, the 
experience seemed like "an exciting adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 "As a teen-ager, I had fun at the camp. We would go sledding in the snow, camp 
at the river and even at Yellowstone Park," he said. "But for my parents, it 
was very painful; they lost everything." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, his father, a farmer, had just bought a new tractor for his 
prospering Los Angeles-area farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakatani's parents and their six children were eventually forced to leave 
their home, carrying only the bare necessities on their backs, and to move to a 
barracks at the camp, confined by barbed-wire fencing and armed guards. For 
three years, his parents endured meager pay for limited manual labor at farms 
and factories. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was in his early 40s, the prime of his life. I don't think I could 
forgive the government for depriving him of those years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing can ever repair the pain. But I think the barracks will alleviate 
some of that pain," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Sakatani nine years to bring the barracks exhibit to fruition. In 
1982, a reunion with friends from the internment camp prompted him to research 
this episode in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 As he examined government documents and newspaper articles from that period, 
Sakatani said he was driven to tell the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a rude awakening. The more I read, the more fascinated I became of 
what happened to (Japanese Americans)," Sakatani said. 
</P>
<P>
 His home is cluttered with boxes of documents, academic reports and literature 
on Japanese American internees. Hoping to bring back a barracks, Sakatani took 
10 trips to Heart Mountain Camp, now a farmland with only about 24 of the 450 
barracks that once housed 10,000 internees. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Japanese American National Museum considered organizing an internment 
exhibit two years ago, he jumped at the chance to bring back original barracks. 
After years of negotiations with the museum and city officials -- the barracks 
sit on a city-owned lot -- he and 40 other Angelenos revisited the Wyoming camp 
last month to dismantle and load up flatbed trucks with two 20-by-60-foot 
barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit represents only half of an authentic barracks; space limitations 
precluded them building it full-size and setting up the other one. 
</P>
<P>
 A family of three usually lived in a single unit, half the size of a typical 
living room and supplied with a single light bulb, a few steel cots and a coal 
stove. There was no running water and just outdoor communal bath facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first moved to the camp, Sakatani said, the huts had no ceilings or 
insulation. Instead, the drafty wood-frame barracks -- often with inch-wide 
openings in the planks -- were merely covered with tar paper on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it would get down to 30 degrees below zero and we had no 
insulation," said Sakatani, rubbing his fingers down the peeling black tar 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the museum paid for the supplies needed for the reconstruction and 
transportation of the barracks, Sakatani relied on volunteers to rebuild it. 
</P>
<P>
 Micki Takeshita, a Denver resident who met the California group in Wyoming, 
flew to Los Angeles last weekend to work on the barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something I can do for Japanese American people and the museum," said 
Takeshita, who was a teen-ager when he and his family were in an internment 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot describe the camp. You had to be there. The government kept it 
real quiet. So I think this will help people be more open about the past," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger generation has been eager to learn about the camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Yamato Danley, 45, who was born after her parents were released from an 
internment camp, said her family was always reluctant to talk about their 
experience. After visiting Heart Mountain and getting involved with the 
barracks exhibit, she said that "this has been a real turning point in my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 "The barrack bridges a gap between my parents and me. This gives me a sense of 
what they went through, helping me re-examine my identity," Yamato Danley said 
while helping with the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakatani's quest to unravel the Japanese American experience does not end with 
the barracks. He fills his time presenting slide shows of the internment camps 
at high schools, spearheading World War II veteran newsletters, and working on 
a book that will chronicle the government documents, reports and articles on 
the camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sakatani: "There's much to be done. I see no end to what I can do to help 
people, especially the younger generations, understand our history."

 Shattering the invisible business wall. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the mission of the USC Black Staff and Faculty Caucus along with the 
Black Alumni: to get surrounding small and minority-owned companies to do 
business with the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with USC's Small Business Development Office, the caucus seeks new 
suppliers to provide goods and services for the university at competitive 
prices. The caucus arranges for South-Central businesses to go through the 
proper bureaucratic channels to compete for accounts offered by the university.

 The group formed in the mid-1960s to work for equality on campus, said Kay 
Allen, president of the caucus and a member since 1979. But since the 
university gave the caucus official standing last June, the group has been able 
to turn its attentions off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The caucus' business reach-out program is in line with the university's stated 
role to serve surrounding communities.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the great things that the caucus has done is to collect business 
cards, put together a database list and send information packets out to 
businesses," said Kevin Kaauwai, senior administrator of the Small Business 
Development Office.  
</P>
<P>
 The office invites potential business partners to an orientation meeting, held 
once a week, and processes their application to do business at USC. Kaauwai 
said about one-third of the applicants eventually become university vendors.

 For the third consecutive year, South-Central-based Hebrew Union 
College-Jewish Institute of Religion has contributed $25,000 to nonprofit 
educational and community service programs in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-time recipients Hoover Intergenerational Center and the United 
Neighborhood Council, as well as Hope in Youth, Girls Inc., Central Recovery 
and Development Ministry and the National Conference of Christians and Jews 
benefited from the college's gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Levi Kingston, founder and director of the 17-year-old Hoover center, said its 
$5,000 gift will be used on property upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that we maintain our building because we deal with children," 
Kingston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, at 3216 S. Hoover Ave., employs senior citizens to care for about 
40 preschool and elementary school children of low- and moderate-income 
families.  
</P>
<P>
 Based on comments from residents, the Los Angeles County Human Relations 
Commission and Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas' office, Hebrew Union College 
grants monetary awards to organizations that are leaders in providing child 
care, after-school programs and supplementary education programs, said Rabbi 
Lee Bycel, dean of the college. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is a symbol of the support that we want to give the agencies and 
programs that are trying to strengthen and promote a more livable community," 
Bycel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls Inc., which offers educational and recreational activities for young 
girls, will use its grant money to cover field trip costs and to buy new books 
and furniture for its facilities at 9004 S. Normandie Ave.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have chairs that are falling apart," said Vickie Hamilton, assistant 
program director. "We are furnishing the center with new tables and chairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Located near USC, Hebrew Union College is an academic arm of the Reform Jewish 
movement and trains rabbis. Founded in 1875, the college is the oldest 
institution of higher Jewish learning in North America. Seventy-five students 
are enrolled in the college, which offers programs in Jewish education, and 
undergraduate and graduate Judaic studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The college established a community relief fund in 1992 with contributions 
from students, faculty, staff and board of directors, and a grant from the 
Skirball Foundation.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; PAINTER CREATES ART FROM THE 'HOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ENRIQUE LAVIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stare at the barrel of a 9-millimeter handgun pointed by the grim image of a 
gangbanger in ". . . Andblastin'back." Get caught in the cross-fire of "Red 
Reality, Blue Insanity," two paintings showing Bloods and Crips shooting at 
each other. Or sympathize with a weeping mother in "Momma: Receiving Bad News 
From Bad News." 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the works of Romelle D'Minter, a 29-year-old South-Central 
Los Angeles artist inspired by the gang life around his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 On exhibit through Nov. 13 at the Julie Rico Gallery in Santa Monica, 
D'Minter's "Something Wickedly Frightening" is a body of black-and-white 
multimedia paintings depicting "organized crime in the 'hood" in a style of art 
he calls "inner-city Expressionism." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reflection of a violent reality," said Rico, owner of the 2-year-old 
gallery on Main Street. "It's poetry from the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Likening D'Minter's works to the impact of Michelangelo's in the 16th Century, 
Rico said, "(Michelangelo) made (people) proud of their community for what it 
was; that's what (D'Minter) is doing. Amid the negativity surrounding him, he 
is able to articulate a language that is foreign to most communities." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Minter's language assaults viewers. The paintings, framed with his trademark 
black-iron anti-burglar bars, dramatize urban gang wars, helplessness and 
empowerment through violence. He simply paints what he sees, he said -- the 
sense of isolation and persecution of people he grew up with and whom he has 
often seen die violently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of my friends were either going to the cemetery or the 
penitentiary," D'Minter said. "I can't even count the number of friends who 
have died. I did a lot of my work in black and white because of the memories I 
had when I was a child. There was nothing colorful about it all -- it was 
death." 
</P>
<P>
 In "For the Dead Homies," a young gangster is pouring Olde English malt liquor 
in the street while holding a sawed-off double-barreled shotgun. The work 
depicts a gang ritual for when a friend is incarcerated or dies, D'Minter said. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Minter is breaking into the mainstream with exhibitions in small galleries 
across the city, embraced by a handful of Los Angeles patrons of 
non-traditional art. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is considered counter-fashion in the art world because its about real 
life," Rico said. "These individuals (captured on painting) are real. Good or 
bad, we as a society should accept that notion because society had failed 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 From the Arroyo Gallery in Pasadena to Gallery X in Hollywood to Zero 1 
Gallery on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, D'Minter's work is being recognized 
as a legitimate form of art. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as dark and underground as it gets. You've seen it in cinema and 
other media; this is just another form of expressing what's going on in their 
world," said Dave Klane, owner of Gallery X. "It's shocking and disturbing to a 
lot of people, and that's good." 
</P>
<P>
 From his bedroom-studio near 49th and Western, D'Minter conceptualized the 
idea of depicting a world of drugs and violence. He knows the street talk and 
walk, but he says he stayed out of gangs "because I was never into teams . . . 
blue fighting red." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Minter began experimenting with various forms of art in 1981. After he 
graduated from Chatsworth High School in the San Fernando Valley, he enrolled 
in Otis College of Art and Design for two years until he ran out of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigued by Hollywood movies of organized crime from the '30s and '40s and 
the hardship that forced mobsters into criminal roles, D'Minter said the 
parallels with his culture were too obvious to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I looked around, I said 'This is going on around in my front yard,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Something Wickedly Frightening' is a revolutionary antidote to the 
problem," D'Minter said. "I'm not trying to glamorize (that lifestyle). I'm 
just painting what I see, so people can realize that it exists." ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; CITY IS TOPS IN AREA FOR ENTREPRENEURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to great freeway access, low taxes and a knock-'em-dead pro-business 
attitude, said Mayor Albert Robles, South Gate has been ranked the No. 1 city 
in Los Angeles County for young, growing companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ranking came as a pleasant surprise to us, since we didn't go after it 
with an aggressive PR campaign," Robles said. "I really think it's the result 
of a concerted effort between the City Council, the Community Redevelopment 
Agency and the number of exciting new businesses that have chosen South Gate." 
</P>
<P>
 The city used to be known as the base for industrial giants such as General 
Motors and Firestone before they closed their factories and took thousands of 
jobs with them in the 1980s. Recently, it was ranked first in Los Angeles 
County and third among 85 California communities within large metropolitan 
areas in a study published by Cognetics Inc., an economic research firm based 
in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, titled "Entrepreneurial Hot Spots: The Best Places in America to 
Start and Grow a Company," ranks places in the United States that are most 
favored by entrepreneurs who are starting and growing companies. It provides 
rankings for regions, states, metropolitan and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The dominant theme of this year's study is the surge of activity in the 
mountain states, said David Birch, Cognetics' president. The Pacific region, 
which includes California, ranked third after the South Atlantic region. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the major factors contributing to high 
entrepreneurial activity for a city are proximity to universities, a skilled 
labor pool, airports, quality of life and a positive entrepreneurial climate. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Sunnyvale ranked No. 1 and Irvine No. 2, followed by South 
Gate, San Francisco and Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's high ranking came as no surprise to Dan Kang, who manages Care-Tex, 
a garment-dying firm with $4 million to $5 million in annual sales and 38 
employees. Care-Tex moved to South Gate two years ago from Paramount because it 
was expanding and needed more space, said Kang, a second-generation Korean 
American whose family owns the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a do-or-die move for us, because if we stayed where we were we would 
have ended up like a lot of other similar businesses and gone under," said 
Kang, who after an extensive site-selection process chose South Gate over Santa 
Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first heard of South Gate, I thought about South-Central -- that it 
would be a dangerous place to start a business. After meeting with city 
officials and getting to know the community, we had a completely different 
opinion. . . . And after it came through the riots with no damage, we knew for 
sure."  
</P>
<P>
 Compared to neighboring communities, South Gate emerged virtually unscathed 
from the 1992 riots, with only $4,900 in property damage, Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Total sales have tripled in the two years since Care-Tex made the move, Kang 
said, and now the company is looking to expand into emerging markets in Asia, 
especially Vietnam, whose economy recently became open to American business 
after the United States ended a trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for South Gate's impressive showing among entrepreneurs has been 
the city's ability to withstand fundamental shifts in its economy, according to 
Andrew Pasmant, the city's director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason is the city's lack of a utilities tax, which can run as high as 
9% in neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been said that we're a community going from smokestacks to short 
stacks," said Pasmant. "We've seen a few large employers like General Motors 
leave the city, only to be replaced by a number of smaller-sized garment 
producers and more service-type industries. I'd say we've weathered the changes 
in a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 On the street level, though, not everyone is convinced that all is well for 
entrepreneurs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 If restaurant owner David Rodriguez had to start his business again, he said, 
it wouldn't be in South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every time I try to advertise with banners or flyers, the city gives 
me a hard time," said Rodriguez, 44, who founded Nana's Restaurant along 
Firestone Boulevard seven months ago with a $75,000 nest egg.  
</P>
<P>
 "You still need permission for this and permission for that," he said. "If I 
were to do this over again, I'd do it in a place like Rancho Cucamonga or 
Signal Hill." SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; STUDENTS HOLD RALLY OPPOSING PROP. 
187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The backdrop was as archetypal American as apple pie: a field of flowing green 
grass, jutting goal posts and weathered bleachers lined with high school 
students joshing each other and shouting cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause for the Monday morning rally, however, had nothing to do with 
bolstering spirit for the Huntington Park High School football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out here not because we want to be, but because we have to be," said 
Lissette Huizar, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 students were excused from class to attend a rally organized by 
students and administrators in opposition of Proposition 187, an initiative on 
the November ballot that would deny public education, health care -- except 
emergency services -- and welfare to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and administrators could be held responsible for reporting suspected 
illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally came after a two-week spurt of walkouts at area schools, including 
Huntington Park High, in which thousands of students have marched through busy 
thoroughfares in opposition to the initiative. It was organized to provide a 
vent for the growing frustration among the many students who perceive the 
measure as anti-immigrant and anti-Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we want to let kids know that cutting school and marching along 
Pacific Boulevard is no way to oppose 187," said Ric Loya, a teacher at the 
school who is also mayor of Huntington Park. "When the cameras show a bunch of 
kids running around wild, shouting cuss words, that just fuels people's fears. 
It strengthens those who actually support 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Prince, a Tustin accountant who is a leading proponent of the proposition, 
said he hadn't heard of the student walkouts or the Huntington Park rally, but 
he did express concern about conditions at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those students that are citizens will be thankful when their schools aren't 
so overcrowded with others that are here illegally, who will be sent back to 
their country of origin," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loya, who led the City Council in September to issue a proclamation denouncing 
the proposition, said that although exact figures are not kept, he estimated 
that up to a quarter of the high school's students are undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Proposition) 187's going to put the entire system in a state of limbo," said 
math teacher MiChung Gilbert. "No one really knows how it's going to be 
enforced, but the burden will probably lie with the administration, not the 
teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the stream of students approaching the podium to speak against 
Proposition 187, that state of limbo has already begun. Students, speaking in 
Spanish and English, alternately shouted down the ballot item for a variety of 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Some thought only those who looked Latino would be singled out. Others thought 
it would wreak havoc on their schools because the federal government may 
withhold $1 billion in funding because the requirements of the initiative 
violate federal regulations.  
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the concern expressed by those who addressed the rally, many of 
the students lining the bleachers chose to use the rally as an excuse to gossip 
or tease other students. Others, though, said they believed some good could 
come about. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this whole 187 thing has any good effect at all, it might be to get people 
my age involved in politics," said Carol Perales, 17. "Then they might learn 
that where we're living right now, it was all part of Mexico at one time, and 
that would give them pride." SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: LINCOLN HEIGHTS; SCHOOL CELEBRATES ITS 50TH BIRTHDAY

 Rose Salcedo remembers when Our Lady Help of Christians School was just a 
handful of bungalows and she was one of four students of the first graduating 
class in 1944.  
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, Salcedo celebrated the school's golden anniversary last 
weekend. A special Mass was held, and current students provided entertainment 
and made presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem like a long time ago because you have so many memories from 
that school," Salcedo, whose last name was Ramirez when she attended Our Lady 
Help of Christians, said Tuesday at her home in Eagle Rock. Two nephews had 
recently been enrolled there, bringing Salcedo back to her alma mater for a 
time to help out with substitute teaching and teaching computer courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50th anniversary was an occasion to reflect on the progress of the school 
for its principal, Sister Maria-Esthela Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, 2024 Darwin Ave., run by the Poor Clair Missionary Sisters, now 
enrolls 300 students, and the average eighth-grade graduating class is 35 
students.  
</P>
<P>
 Rummaging through the school's archives, Gonzalez found only one picture of 
the five old buildings that had been set up during World War II for the 
kindergarten-to-eighth-grade school. In the late '50s, two of those bungalows 
were demolished to make way for the new buildings and the students were crammed 
into the remaining bungalows during construction, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in September, 1962, officials inaugurated the buildings that now make up 
Our Lady Help of Christians School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been here so long, I've seen the school grow and get better in many 
aspects," Gonzalez said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez arrived in 1975, six years after the seventh and eighth grades had 
been transferred to Our Lady Queen of Angels Middle School at Hill and Ord 
streets in Downtown. Parents were unhappy with the transfer and were able to 
bring back those grades in 1978.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest accomplishments for the school over the years has been to 
get a sound barrier wall to block the noise from the Golden State Freeway that 
often disrupted classroom lessons. Students, parents and teachers wrote to 
government officials, even then-Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., pleading to 
erect the wall and restore their sanity. In 1981, the wall was built. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway has provided more memorable episodes for the students, including 
the time a student kicked a ball over the school buildings toward the freeway 
when a noisy truck was barreling down the off-ramp at Daly Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball struck the wide-open mouth of a big face painted on the side of the 
truck, creating hysterical laughter from the whole student body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was teaching eighth grade and the truck was making such a noise," Gonzalez 
said. "It made all the students just crack up, it was so funny." 
</P>
<P>
 The anniversary celebration may be one of the last memories of the school for 
Sister Esthela, as she is known to the students. She will soon be moving to her 
order's headquarters in Rome after 19 years at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 For Salcedo and other alumni, the reunion was a chance to get reacquainted 
with people who shared the same Catholic education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a day for remembrances and memories," Gonzalez said. "It was 
beautiful." MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; COMMUNITY CENTER GETS YEAR EXTENSION

<P>
 The Door of Hope Community Center, which provides food donations, education 
and other services, recently got word that it will be able to stay at least 
another year at the warehouse it has used for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The warehouse at 1250 S. Goodrich Blvd. was donated by East Los Angeles 
Community Union, a nonprofit developer that has built low-cost housing across 
the city. Praise Chapel, which has operated Door of Hope for three years, plans 
to seek grants so it can eventually rent the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Door of Hope, operated by volunteers and Pastor Edward Melendez and his wife, 
Shirley, includes a food bank, addiction recovery programs, computer training 
classes and youth activities. Before the warehouse space was donated, the 
center, which began with a food pantry and expanded to other services, was run 
from the church across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The warehouse will be converted to classrooms and offices with the help of 
donated building materials and labor. And volunteers hope to begin new 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to start a youth center," said volunteer Lydia Cardenas, a Praise 
Chapel member who started volunteering full time when she was laid off from her 
job in April. "We're trying to get pool tables and a Ping-Pong table. We have 
one that's falling apart but the kids use it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Former dropouts have started taking classes there to earn their high school 
diplomas. Recently, a class of 10 adults finished a six-month course in 
computer basics. 
</P>
<P>
 The church also hopes to start a program for latch-key children. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Castro, director of the Northeast Juvenile Justice Center, said he has 
referred about 50 juveniles to Door of Hope for adult mentors. 
</P>
<P>
 His staff has also directed dozens of the juveniles' families to the food bank 
and contributed apples and oranges to food baskets that the center puts 
together during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider them a lead agency in providing a need," Castro said. "They're 
one of the few agencies in the area that provides (those) kind of services to 
the families. As word got out that they are a real agency, they have grown."  
</P>
<P>
 Although the center has provided a field trip for the youths and plans another 
in November, it concentrates on what it can show them in their own 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started at the church with a few cupboards and we tried to show the kids 
about sharing for the less fortunate," Cardenas said. "They started bringing in 
cans at every service and we became overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
 The center depends on volunteers, mostly members of the church such as Carmen 
Surveyor, who teaches the beginning computer class on Monday nights. Surveyor, 
who designed the curriculum, has seen some success stories, including one woman 
who was able to keep her job as a result of learning about computers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Being able to help them and see them prosper in their own life is 
gratification for me," said Surveyor, who recalled that half of the 50 who 
originally signed up for the course had to first learn how to type. "It's 
important that I'm giving back to my area. I like to help the people in my own 
neighborhood." MARY ANNE PEREZ

 County officials turned over architectural and engineering reports to federal 
and state officials Thursday morning in hopes of receiving $1 billion in 
earthquake recovery money to rebuild County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials believe the January earthquake caused more damage to the 
medical center than any hospital in U.S. history has sustained from a natural 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Original estimates of $400 million in damage were increased after engineers 
and architects closely examined the damaged buildings and took into account the 
work that will be needed to dismantle the 16 permanently closed buildings, said 
Hospital Executive Director Edward L. Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state officials are expected to respond to the request in about 
three weeks. MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
 Seventeen years after leaving El Salvador, 68-year-old Marcos Guido is writing 
home for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Not because he ever forgot the children and grandchildren he left behind, or 
because he never took the time to write. It's because until recently, he never 
knew how. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had to look for someone to write my letters for me," said Guido 
recently at the third annual graduation ceremony for Centro Latino de Educacion 
Popular, a Temple-Beaudry center dedicated to teaching illiterate Latino 
immigrants how to read and write in their native tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different now," said a beaming Guido, a retired mason who began working 
as a child. "Now my family understands what I want to say to them, and I feel 
proud." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1991, Centro Latino de Educacion Popular is funded through private 
donations, so there is no charge to students, most of whom are working poor 
from the surrounding area. More than 100 students have come through the center 
since its inception, said executive director Marcos Cajina. 
</P>
<P>
 The center combines literacy classes with practical information in its 
curriculum, teaching students how they can best apply the skills they learn to 
their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Cajina volunteered a few examples of the vocabulary words the recent graduates 
-- who attended evening classes every day for several months -- learned to 
spell, write and read. 
</P>
<P>
 "We taught them words like vivienda (housing), pandillas (gangs), inmigracion 
(immigration), educacion (education), Latinos , and exito (success)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a useful vocabulary, students also learned how to fill out 
applications and write personal checks. 
</P>
<P>
 For Liliana Rivera, a 50-year-old housekeeper, her newfound ability to read 
and write has not only made life easier, but also inspired in her a passion for 
learning. Orphaned at the age of three and raised by an aunt in a rural 
Guatemalan village that had no school, Rivera never had a chance to learn about 
what is now one of her favorite subjects -- prehistoric animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm reading this book called ' Evolucion ' (Evolution) right now, and 
learning about mammoths," said Rivera with childlike delight. "I can read all 
sorts of books now, even difficult ones. I'm so happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Cajina said the center has made plans with Echo Park's Pioneer Market to have 
personal narratives written by recent graduates printed on the stores' grocery 
bags beginning in November, so that people might see illiterate immigrants in a 
different light. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the face of all this immigrant bashing, we want people to see that these 
people are working hard and trying to get ahead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the graduates plan to pick up English once they feel comfortable 
enough with their Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I'm advanced in my years, I'm going to keep learning. This is just 
the first step," said Guido, who is expecting his first American-born 
grandchild in a month.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: SOUTHWEST; 4 BUILDINGS DESIGNATED 16TH QUAKE GHOST 
TOWN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Housing Department recently designated four buildings near La 
Cienega Boulevard the 16th "ghost town" damaged by the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a high concentration of damage in the area" in terms of the 
numbers of buildings, said Capri Wiggins, Housing Department project manager 
for the new ghost town in the 1600 block of Corning Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there is a lot of damage to these buildings with graffiti and vagrants 
sleeping inside and starting small fires," Wiggins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three duplexes and one four-unit apartment building sustained more than 
$150,000 in damage from the January temblor, Wiggins said. Tenants vacated all 
of the buildings, leaving them open to squatters, drug users and vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the carpet in one of the buildings is scarred by graffiti. Empty malt 
liquor bottles litter the floors and remains of small fires mar the sinks in 
some of the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The duplex that received the least damage from the quake -- $30,000 -- was 
destroyed by arson on Oct. 10, Wiggins added. City housing officials designated 
the area a ghost town three days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Housing Department's earthquake recovery program had been 
trying since August to get the small block designated a ghost town after 
Councilman Nate Holden's office alerted them to the problems. The block is in 
Holden's 10th Council District. 
</P>
<P>
 As a ghost town, the area now receives 24-hour security. Wiggins said city 
officials will board up the four buildings and will schedule them for 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Another ghost town located nearby in West Adams contains a cluster of damaged 
single-family houses and a couple of duplexes and multiunit dwellings. LUCILLE

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: LEIMERT PARK; BLACK GROUP OFFERS INPUT ON ECONOMY 
</P>

<P>
 Lee Turner heard plenty of rumblings among African Americans about the need to 
take a role in rebuilding the Central City after the 1992 riots, but he saw 
little action to back up the words. 
</P>
<P>
 So Turner, a Los Angeles real estate developer, helped pull together several 
black organizations to form the African American Development Consortium. The 
group aims to represent black interests to politicians and developers who plan 
construction in central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Consortium members say they will act as political watchdogs by keeping abreast 
of government-funded development projects in central Los Angeles -- 
particularly Crenshaw -- and making sure black contractors, architects and 
others are invited to bid for the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (African Americans) need to be more proactive in providing leadership as 
well as suggesting and supporting legislation," said Turner, who is chairman of 
the consortium. "Development won't get done through government and other 
traditional outlets. . . . It's time to take the bull by the horns." 
</P>
<P>
 Formed six months ago, the consortium includes seven local black 
organizations, most of them construction-related: the Assn. of Black Builders 
and Contractors, Consolidated Realty Board, Minority Developers Coalition, the 
National Organization of Minority Architects, the Southern California Black 
Carpenters Assn., the Black Business Assn. and the Black Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 To inform the public of its goals and query local politicians about the state 
of black involvement in construction projects, the group held its first town 
hall forum last week at the Vision Center in Leimert Park. At the meeting, 
about 100 people listened to updates on development projects from Reps. Maxine 
Waters (D-Los Angeles) and Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles), Assembly candidate 
Kevin Murray, City Councilmen Nate Holden and Mark Ridley-Thomas, and state 
Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, detailing the ongoing debate in the Vermont Knolls area over whether 
to erect public housing or commercial projects, strongly encouraged the 
audience to stay involved in the decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (politicians) are in the business of allocating money for projects right 
in your neighborhoods. You must have a say in what happens," she said. 
"Otherwise, more public housing projects will go up in areas already full of 
them, and ghettos will be perpetuated. You have to stay on top of things."  
</P>
<P>
 For Skip Cooper, president of the Black Business Assn., the consortium is a 
significant first: a black interorganizational effort whose value goes well 
beyond simply monitoring construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intent is multifaceted: influencing public policy, ensuring the 
participation of blacks in business, creating employment opportunities," he 
said. "We felt the need for blacks to come together to make sure all of these 
aspects are addressed, but also to make sure these different organizations 
won't be pitted against each other." ERIN J. AUBRY

<P>
 The Community Financial Resource Center, in conjunction with First African 
Methodist Episcopal Church, will provide loans of up to $25,000 for small and 
new businesses as a way to bolster the economy in the aftermath of the January 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The $300,000 loan program will disburse money through FAME Renaissance, the 
nonprofit economic development arm of First AME Church.The 2-year-old center, 
launched jointly by city and private agencies, provides businesses and 
homeowners with financial services and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Resource center Executive Director Roberto Barragan said businesses that were 
already in financial straits were pushed closer to the edge by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Many businesses, including several at Santa Barbara Plaza in the Crenshaw 
district, have been rejected for loans and disaster assistance by the Small 
Business Administration and banks. Barragan said the resource center's loan 
criteria will be much more lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 "These loans are for people who need to hire a person, open a storefront, get 
back inventory," he said. "Our goal is to put all the money out into the 
streets. . . . Then we can concentrate on getting more." 
</P>
<P>
 The funds were made available through participating resource center banks, the 
city Community Development Department and the center's own seed loan program.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CHINATOWN/ECHO PARK; SURVEY SEEKS ASIAN ATTITUDES ON 
DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty bilingual volunteers fanned out in Echo Park, Westlake and Silver Lake 
on Saturday as part of a countywide survey about substance abuse and related 
problems among Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Headed by East/West Community Partnership in Chinatown, a federally funded 
project of the Asian American Drug Abuse Program, the survey will also be 
conducted in Chinatown, Koreatown and communities throughout the San Gabriel 
Valley and South Bay, said Allison Tom, project director.The door-to-door 
survey will continue through early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey addresses such issues as drug habits, opinions on alcohol, tobacco 
and other drugs, domestic violence, knowledge of drug services and community 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the data is compiled, project organizers hope to create drug prevention 
programs that will address the community's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Asian Americans make up 10% of the county population, but few 
county programs target the community, Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prevailing 'model minority' myth has barred us from these resources. The 
commissions and Board of Supervisors believe that Asians don't have drug 
problems," Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many Asian American social agencies are unaware that county funding is 
unavailable, Tom said, her staff will also inform these groups of possible 
grants as they survey the communities.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; STATUS OF MEMORIAL CONCERNS VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A veterans group is concerned that its plan to build a World War II memorial 
to honor Japanese American soldiers could remain in limbo after the City 
Council's decision to drop the 1st Street North development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were ready to build three years ago," said Hank Yoshitake, former 
president of the 100th/442nd Veterans Assn. "We don't have 10, 15 years to 
wait. . . . We want to have it built while we're still here." 
</P>
<P>
 The group and the Military Intelligence Service Club of Southern California -- 
both made up mainly of World War II Japanese American veterans -- formed a 
memorial foundation in 1988 and have raised more than $600,000 for the 
monument. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts came in response to city officials' request for a 
community-financed war memorial to be erected in the 1st Street North project 
area, bounded by Temple, San Pedro, 1st and Alameda streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed monument would resemble a hill to signify the sites of the 
battles that the Asian American soldiers fought in Europe. It would be 40 feet 
in diameter and 9 feet tall. Similar to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, 
it would be made of black granite, with names of nearly 15,000 Japanese 
American soldiers etched on the reverse and an explanation of the monument on 
the front, foundation members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's supposed to focus in on the reason why these young men and women went 
overseas in spite of what was going on back home," such as the forced 
internment of Japanese Americans, Yoshitake said. 
</P>
<P>
 A developer's plans had called for it to be prominently featured in a 
20,000-square-foot plaza, between the Museum of Contemporary Art's Temporary 
Contemporary and the Japanese American National Museum, he said. It also would 
have been surrounded by a city office tower, a 500-room hotel, shops and 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council voted to drop that project Oct. 5, it did agree to keep 
the memorial proposal alive and provide "adequate space at the city's 1st 
Street North property" near the Japanese American National Museum and the 
Temporary Contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Yoshitake, 69, and foundation President Young O. Kim, 75, are 
concerned that if the developer follows through on his threat to sue the 
council over its rejection of the 1st Street North project, the property could 
be left undeveloped for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation plans to hold a meeting next month to consider alternative 
sites in Little Tokyo for the memorial project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not committed to any area right now," said Yoshitake. "If (city 
officials) put us somewhere in the corner . . . that may not be what we want." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris O'Donnell, a chief legislative analyst for the council, said the city is 
committed to seeing the memorial through and placing it in a visible location 
near 1st and Alameda streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not supposed to be stuck in the corner," O'Donnell said. "The intention 
is to provide public space that is highly accessible and highly visible." TOMMY

U.S. CITIZENS BY BIRTH, CITY RESIDENTS BY CHOICE, PUERTO RICANS FIND THEMSELVES 
A STRICTLY LEGAL BUT ALIENATED MINORITY HERE, STRUGGLING FOR A SENSE OF 
COMMUNITY. THEY ARE . . . ; ONE OF L.A.'S BEST KEPT SECRETS 
</P>

<P>
 FOR PUERTO RICANS, LIFE IN LOS ANGELES CAN be especially lonely. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the city's huge Latino population, it is impossible to find a Puerto 
Rican community organization. There are no Puerto Rican barrios or baseball 
teams. And as best as can be determined, there are no Puerto Rican restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversations in Spanish are filled with slang unfamiliar to 
"puertorriquenos," also known as "boricuas." Festivals feature mariachis far 
more often than salsa. Bank tellers hesitate to cash checks from Puerto Rico, 
where the currency is the U.S. dollar. And grocery stores with Latino food 
rarely carry Puerto Rican products. 
</P>
<P>
 To top it off, many local residents, including Latinos, are unaware that 
Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens at birth. That may cause a special problem 
considering the sentiment surrounding Proposition 187, the initiative to 
restrict services for illegal immigrants in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will hurt everybody who is not white," said Jorge Pineiro, 61, a longtime 
activist statewide who is treasurer of the San Jose-based Western Region Puerto 
Rican Council. "There are many Puerto Ricans who are brown or black or speak 
with an accent. I'm a citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 To Pineiro and others, the debate over immigration reform is only the latest 
example of how the Puerto Rican experience in Los Angeles and other parts of 
the state differs from that of all other Latino groups. 
</P>
<P>
 One basic problem, activists say, is that the Puerto Rican community in Los 
Angeles is small and dispersed compared to the region's massive Mexican and 
Central American communities. Many Puerto Ricans are either too preoccupied 
professionally, too busy with family responsibilities or struggling too much to 
organize as a community. 
</P>
<P>
 But the situation in Los Angeles is considered shameful by those who point out 
that Puerto Ricans have a history in California that dates back to at least the 
early 1900s. Active Puerto Rican advocacy groups exist in other communities 
such as San Diego or San Francisco, but not Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no agency to help a Puerto Rican who arrives (in Los Angeles) from 
Hawaii or San Juan or Chicago," Pineiro said. "There should be a center to at 
least provide referrals." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, the 1990 U.S. Census counted more than 40,000 Puerto 
Ricans, with nearly 14,500 living in the city itself. Small pockets of Puerto 
Ricans were counted in surrounding municipalities such as South Gate, where 
there were about 1,000, Huntington Park, where there were more than 500, and 
Bell Gardens, where there were about 120. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists say that if one figures in the hundreds of Puerto Ricans the census 
probably missed, the need for Puerto Rican unity is even more evident. Already 
clear is that Puerto Ricans in Los Angeles exist at all economic levels as 
entertainers, professionals, laborers and the unemployed, they are spread about 
in various neighborhoods, and relatively few know each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Vega, 43, of Echo Park, said he was unaware of any Puerto Ricans in the 
area besides a few relatives. That's the way it has been since he came to Los 
Angeles from New York about 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't that many," said Vega, who was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, but 
was raised mainly in New York. "If there are I don't know where they usually go 
or hang out." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega, who is unemployed, said he keeps busy by working odd jobs, preparing for 
job opportunities such as being a truck driver, and by volunteering at a local 
youth program where his girlfriend works. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Puerto Rican households seem to be doing about as well as the area's 
Mexican American households at making ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city, the census showed, the median household income for Puerto Ricans 
was about $23,800, compared to about $24,200 for Mexican Americans and about 
$31,000 for all residents. In the county, the median household income for 
Puerto Ricans was about $29,600, compared to about $28,000 for Mexican 
Americans and about $35,000 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the feeling of isolation hits home in different ways. Some Puerto 
Ricans miss the lively politics and cultural events found on the island or in 
the Northeast, where Puerto Ricans are the dominant Latino group in cities like 
New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others get cravings for traditional foods like " bacalaitos " (cod 
fritters) or " alcapurrias " (ground plantain or yucca filled with meat and 
then fried). Even the name for beans is different: Puerto Ricans call them " 
habichuelas ," while most Latinos in Los Angeles know them as "frijoles." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the kind of isolation, several local Puerto Ricans said, that tugs at 
one's insides from time to time but normally would not cause someone to leave a 
good job or the California sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little sad," said Ivette Rodriguez, 28, who came to Los Angeles less 
than two years ago from New York and is a field manager promoting the film "I 
Like It Like That" for Columbia Pictures. "Whenever I meet somebody who's 
Puerto Rican it's a treat for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Rosario, who was born in Cidra, Puerto Rico, and now lives in South 
Gate, said the Puerto Ricans she knows are the few who work with her at Puerto 
Rico Tourism Co. near Universal City. Outside the office, being around members 
of other Latino groups speaking Spanish can be odd, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel lonely. It's not the same," said Rosario, 33, an administrative 
assistant. "We try to talk to each other and even that is different. I get 
really happy when I see a car with a Puerto Rican flag on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosario said she came to the Los Angeles area about two years ago with her 
fiance, Raffaele Russo, also 33, and the couple married in February. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Rosario said, she has had her share of annoying experiences involving 
people who do not know anything about Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look at me and they don't know where I came from," she said, smiling. 
"They think I have a green card. It's very difficult. I go, 'OK, here I go 
again. Explanation time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Puerto Rico, a Caribbean island about the size of Connecticut, became a U.S. 
territory in 1898. Congress made Puerto Ricans citizens of the United States in 
1917 and the current commonwealth status was established in 1952. Puerto Ricans 
on the island, which has about 3.6 million residents, elect their own governor 
and legislature but cannot vote in presidential elections. There are about 3 
million Puerto Ricans living on the mainland who are eligible for all the 
rights or benefits of any U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosario realizes that some people who question her citizenship don't mean to 
be offensive. "It's because they think anyone from outside the United States 
(mainland) is an alien," she said. "They want to know how you got in here. How 
you got into the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Pineiro, who moved to San Francisco from Puerto Rico in 1953, is happy to tell 
anyone about how Puerto Ricans began arriving in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1900s, West Coast companies recruited Puerto Ricans to work as 
laborers in Hawaii to help farm sugar cane and grow pineapples. Some Puerto 
Ricans made it to Hawaii and stayed, some made it but returned to California 
and others made it as far as California and stayed because of factory jobs and 
other work available in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Although census figures show about 126,500 Puerto Ricans living throughout 
California, activists say there are perhaps thousands more residents of Puerto 
Rican heritage living in all parts of the state. Puerto Ricans are multiracial 
-- brown, black or white. 
</P>
<P>
 Census figures also show that about 7.7 million Latinos live in California. Of 
those, the overwhelming majority -- more than 6.1 million -- are of Mexican 
descent. In Los Angeles County, there are more than 2.5 million residents of 
Mexican descent. 
</P>
<P>
 While Puerto Ricans are undoubtedly outnumbered, some of the community's 
activists believe a significant undercount occurred in the 1990 census for at 
least a few reasons. One is that many Puerto Ricans in the state are third or 
fourth generation, or have married members of other ethnic groups, and no 
longer identify themselves as Puerto Ricans on official documents. And there 
are probably those who do not identify themselves as Puerto Ricans because of 
an "inferiority complex" stemming from their relatively small numbers in any 
one community, activists said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those reasons applies to David Vargas, 19, who grew up in Los Angeles 
and is a sophomore at Occidental College in Eagle Rock. Vargas, whose relatives 
came to California in the 1950s via New York City, feels strong ties to his 
Puerto Rican roots and plans to work as a lawyer on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually people stereotype you as being Mexican out here in California," said 
Vargas, who is majoring in political science and Spanish. "They don't see 
nationality. All they see is color. They see brown and they think there's no 
other Latinos in this country."  
</P>
<P>
 Adaliz Elvira, who was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, and came to Los 
Angeles 11 years ago, said one of her most disturbing experiences when she was 
starting out here was getting checks from the island cashed at local banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought it was foreign currency. It was horrible," said Elvira, 33, 
former regional sales director at the University City tourism company. "I 
became angry. I used to fight and fight. I started crying in the bank. They 
should know that we use U.S. dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Pineiro, an inspector for Lockheed Missile and Space Co. who plans to retire 
in January after 33 years with the company, sees the need for a Puerto Rican 
group in Los Angeles. More Puerto Ricans are likely to come West from the East 
Coast looking for a better life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are here and they're still coming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pineiro said one way to attract attention from decision makers who can help 
generate greater clout for the community would be to recruit professionals and 
high-profile Puerto Ricans who live in the area, like entertainer Rita Moreno, 
to make public declarations. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the people who are recognized and respected and will not be turned 
away," he said. "Along with other professional people, they should be able to 
put together a professional Puerto Rican organization and be like the 
godfathers of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But even some Puerto Rican celebrities find it tough to get any respect. 
</P>
<P>
 When legendary golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez this month was named grand marshal of 
the 1995 Tournament of Roses, many area residents were scratching their heads 
wondering who he was and asking whether Arnold Palmer was available. This even 
though Rodriguez, a native of Puerto Rico, for years has entertained on golf 
courses worldwide and worked for children's hospitals and orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 Some activists say such ignorance actually discourages some local Puerto 
Ricans from being public about their ethnicity. Others say members of the 
Puerto Rican community must overcome the slights by organizing effectively and 
commanding respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio A. Sanchez, 39, a native of Aibonito, Puerto Rico, who has lived in 
Los Angeles for 12 years and works as a researcher, said Puerto Ricans in Los 
Angeles seem to be less outspoken because they are more secure. Puerto Ricans 
are the only Latino group in the nation whose entry into the United States is 
automatic -- no passport, visa or refugee/exile status required.  
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, who came to the area to study at UCLA and look for job opportunities, 
said that in general, Puerto Ricans must endure a "second-class status" on the 
mainland. There is no doubt that many local residents assume Puerto Ricans must 
be of Mexican descent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't even know where Puerto Rico is," he said, adding that during a 
recent job interview he was asked how well he knew Tijuana. "I said, 'Well, I'm 
Puerto Rican.' I don't know if it's ignorance or what. I don't get offended. I 
admire the Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez was among several people who remembered Puerto Rican organizations in 
Los Angeles that have come and gone over the years. A few Puerto Rican 
restaurants survived briefly in the city as well, but Cuban eateries are where 
many " boricuas " turn to these days, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, maintaining other cultural ties to Puerto Rico amounts to being 
regulars when salsa is played at such popular Downtown dance spots as the Shark 
Club on Grand Avenue. Some senior citizens keep busy as part of a group called 
"Club Puertorriqueno de Personas Mayores."  
</P>
<P>
 But for many Puerto Ricans in Los Angeles, the dance nights are few. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Vega, 33, a private Spanish teacher who lives in Silver Lake, spends much 
of his time tutoring, writing free-lance journalism pieces and managing a 
15-unit apartment building. A native of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, Vega's small 
apartment features a large Puerto Rican flag -- red, white and blue with a 
single star -- and numerous snapshots of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 While Vega is proud of his roots and misses his family, he feels at home in 
Los Angeles. Since arriving in the area in 1979 to study television production 
and journalism, he has found a lifestyle he enjoys.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a part of the Los Angeles community," said Vega, who is not related to 
Carlos Vega. "I think Puerto Ricans tend to be more individualistic than other 
Latinos. We don't come here for political reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 And whether Puerto Ricans in Los Angeles find other reasons to routinely turn 
to each other for help remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan A. Figueroa, president and general counsel for the Puerto Rican Legal 
Defense and Education Fund, said the New York-based agency is involved with 
issues affecting Puerto Ricans throughout the nation but has yet to be called 
upon for anything specific to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Puerto Ricans get lumped into the majority community," Figueroa said. 
"That's good if the Mexican American leadership is paying attention. It's bad 
if they're not and the community gets lost."

THE RETURN OF THE COLONEL; OLIVER NORTH'S CONTEMPT FOR CONGRESS BROUGHT HIM 
NOTORIETY, AND IN A YEAR WHEN MANY VOTERS SHARE THAT SCORN, IT MAY JUST WIN HIM 
A SENATE SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nina J. Easton, Nina J. Easton is the magazine's staff writer. Her last 
article was on a teenager's sexual-harassment case against a Northern 
California school district.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty-five days ahead of him, 13,000 miles behind him, Lt. Col. Oliver L. 
North, USMC (Ret.), steps out of a motor home nicknamed Rolling Thunder and 
walks toward his next audience. For today's performance, North is not the 
decorated Marine colonel on trial for intentionally deceiving Congress. He's 
not the Reagan insider who orchestrated a covert gun-running operation to the 
Nicaraguan rebels from his tiny office a few steps from the West Wing. Today's 
Oliver North is just a Virginia businessman who thinks taxes are too high. And, 
come Nov. 8, if the voters of the Old Dominion will have him, he'd like to 
represent their interests in the United States Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, call him Ollie. 
</P>
<P>
 North brings to this gathering in front of the colonial Loudoun County 
Courthouse all the trappings of a successful Virginia businessman: the 
gray-flecked hair, the Burberry tie and crisp white dress shirt (sleeves rolled 
up, candidate style), black stitched cowboy boots. His gait is a little stiff, 
not surprising for a man injured first in a devastating car crash and later in 
the jungles of the DMZ when he took grenade fragments to the hand and leg while 
trying to clear out North Vietnamese army units. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this September morning, as North surprises the crowd from behind, he is 
momentarily awkward and self-conscious. There is a flash of insecurity that 
recalls, for the briefest moment, the Senate Caucus Room in July, 1987, when a 
youthful 43-year-old Marine did his Jimmy Stewart best to convince a nation to 
embrace his sometimes lonely, secret war against the communist bear. 
</P>
<P>
 From the back of the crowd, numbering about 100, chanting begins -- "OL-LIE! 
OL-OLIE!" -- and a lopsided smile starts to crack across North's face. Northern 
Virginia, with its suburban D.C. pockets of liberalism, can be dicey territory 
for North. But here in Leesburg, the site of a bloody Union defeat on nearby 
bluffs above the Potomac River, he is in solid conservative territory. And he's 
among neighbors: His $1.17-million, 194-acre farmhouse estate, named Narnia 
after the fantasy land in C.S. Lewis' children's books, is just over the county 
line.  
</P>
<P>
 The autograph pen comes out, the hand begins the politician's shake, and 
within a few minutes North is standing next to a bronzed statue of Gen. George 
C. Marshall urging his followers to "create a new generation of leadership" -- 
starting with him. "Some of this is blatant self-interest," he accedes, with a 
Reagan-like nod of the head, "because I am also a Loudoun County businessman, 
and the law officers in Loudoun County wear the armor that my company makes 
there in Sterling, Va. It has saved the lives of law officers all over America. 
The employees there are mostly minorities, they are mostly people who otherwise 
wouldn't have a job. But they do have a job because we have a free-enterprise 
system that allows them to go out and work and get the blessed dignity of an 
honest day's wage for an honest day's work." 
</P>
<P>
 But not for long. Not if President Clinton and his cronies, foremost among 
them Democratic opponent Sen. Charles S. Robb, continue to tax and regulate 
businesses to death. Not if they can continue their "wrongheaded" foreign 
policy and attacks on the U.S. Constitution. "I ask you for your prayers," 
North calls out to the crowd of well-dressed white professionals and 
housewives. "Professional pundits tell me all the time you can't talk about the 
power of prayer in modern elections. We shall see, friends. We . . . shall . . 
. see." 
</P>
<P>
 After that warm-up, North confidently plunges into the crowd; he's been on the 
campaign trail since January, and before that he was a regular among 
conservative groups that paid upward of $25,000 to fawn over him. The back-pats 
and photo ops are interrupted when the local Statehouse delegate introduces 
North to one voter who still isn't convinced: Kathy Adcock, Republican mother 
of two young boys. With an accent as soft as the Virginia horizon, Adcock tells 
North that she is concerned about "whether the controversy between you and 
Congress is going to pose any problems in your ability to work with Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Through long eyelashes, North fixes his gaze on her and delivers a vigorous, 
single-minded defense of his campaign that goes on for several minutes, as 
aides and fans try to divert his attention. "I'm not going to be passive. I'm 
going to be the most energetic United States senator you have ever seen, and 
that's how you build a consensus." Finally, he turns away, apparently thinking 
he's charmed another convert. If so, he's wrong. "I agree with what he says" 
about the issues, Adcock tells me. But because he sees Congress as the enemy, 
"I just don't think he can do it."  
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes later, North is inside the local hangout across the street, 
Leesburg Restaurant, shaking hands with mostly awe-struck patrons. An attorney 
who looks to be in his 60s sits on a counter bar stool, in front of the 
bell-jarred doughnuts, sipping his coffee and pointedly minding his own 
business when North makes the mistake of patting him on the back and soliciting 
his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," the man drawls thickly. "I'm sorry, I'm not going to vote for you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that right?" asks North, hands on his hips, body coiled for the rebound. 
"Which one you gonna vote for?"  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to vote for Mr. Robb," he answers as North's supporters let out a 
low-level "o-o-o-o!"  
</P>
<P>
 "It's America," says North, waving down his supporters. "He's allowed to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while," responds the attorney. "Once you get in, you'll try to change 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't try to change that. I ah--" 
</P>
<P>
 That dig catches North off-balance. By now, he should move on. But North has 
never been known as a quitter. He presses on with the cocksureness of a man 
experienced in talking his way past enemy lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me just ask you one thing: Are your taxes high enough?"  
</P>
<P>
 The attorney firmly disputes North's assertion that the Clinton Administration 
raised his taxes before he brings up what's really on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're lucky to be out," the attorney hisses. "You shouldn't be running 
around here running for office. The place you should be is looking through the 
bars." He holds his fists tight against his heavy jowls to mimic prison bars. 
</P>
<P>
 North's jaw tightens. "I'll tell you something, sir. I will put my credibility 
and my integrity up against anybody who's there today and anybody who's 
running. Because my motive is in saving the lives of other people." 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't save other people. What you did was you trashed the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," North closes dismissively, "I believe in supporting the Constitution." 
And turning away to a friendly supporter, he begins again with an energetic 
"How ya doing?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ollie North is the hero of his own life story, a story that pollsters say has 
earned him the adulation of about one-quarter of Virginia's voters and the 
scorn of nearly half. "Some people have portrayed our family as unusually 
patriotic," he writes of his childhood in his best-selling book "Under Fire." 
"My own 3d Squad would comment that I was very brave. . . . But it wasn't 
bravery that pushed me to act," he continues in the next installment, "One More 
Mission." He is, in this story, a man who pushed his Marines too hard, who 
always works too much, who is too dedicated to the cause of liberty and 
freedom. His stock line about the Iran-Contra affair is that he made some 
mistakes, but he did it to "save lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in Act III of a story that has already moved from courageous Marine to 
courageous statesman for the Reagan White House, North is trying to launch a 
career as courageous politician -- out to save Congress from itself. To do so, 
he has transformed himself into the true son of that modern-day Republican 
hero, Ronald Reagan. Even the plot feels eerily familiar: North as the 
gap-toothed innocent waging a red-white-and-blue crusade against an entrenched 
and powerful liberal elite.  
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the comparison works, though the Reagan he's emulating is more 
the combative cowboy of the 1970s than the avuncular old man who left office in 
1988. North has the same aw-shucks demeanor -- right down to the ranch-hand 
garb in his TV spots -- and a penchant for telling a story that sometimes 
stretches fact. He wears a self-proclaimed label as family man, man of prayer 
and patriot on his rolled-up sleeve. He describes a Norman Rockwell childhood 
and wonders aloud why we can't turn the pages back. His campaign video uses a 
similar glib shorthand to describe the supposed dangers of a "radical" left: 
With its strung-together shots of Ted Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Jane Fonda, it 
harks back to the GOP circa 1980 (just substitute Jimmy Carter for Clinton). 
</P>
<P>
 North even displays a Reagan-esque awkwardness on racial issues. The media 
lunged at him for comments supporting the display of the Confederate flag, a 
symbol of slavery to much of the South's African-American community. Other 
comments go unnoticed. North says he wants to reach out to black voters left in 
the lurch by the withdrawal of black former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who had 
been running for the Senate as an independent. But at his Leesburg campaign 
stop, North praised Wilder as a man who "made it before the era of quotas and 
all that." 
</P>
<P>
 And like Reagan, North is a fierce partisan. When U.S. troops recently poured 
into the Persian Gulf, he asserted that Clinton's military was too weak to fend 
off an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, raising questions about North's patriotism. He 
later backed off, but insisted that "Bill Clinton is not my commander in 
chief." 
</P>
<P>
 In a year when Republicans might gain a majority in the House for the first 
time since the mid-1950s, and stand a better-than-even chance of capturing the 
Senate after losing it in 1986, North's campaign is the perfect expression of 
the anti-incumbent mood sweeping the country. In an August national survey by 
GOP pollster Frank Luntz, 44% of respondents considered the government an 
obstacle to "achieving the American dream." In this year's congressional races, 
that anger has led to tight contests for such lords of liberalism as 
Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Pennsylvania Sen. Harris Wofford and 
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington. At the state level, Democratic 
stalwarts such as New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Texas Gov. Ann Richards are 
fighting for their political lives.  
</P>
<P>
 With his "get-the-government-the-heck-outta-there" message, North hopes to 
surf that conservative populist sentiment straight into Room 493 of the Russell 
Senate Office Building. North's election to a body he calls "the imperial 
Congress" would be the ultimate flip-off from a frustrated electorate to a smug 
political Establishment. "This guy sends an in-your-face message to official 
Washington at a time when public esteem for political institutions is very, 
very low," says Mark Rozell, political science professor at Mary Washington 
College in Fredericksburg, Va. What better way to drive home voter anger at 
government than to elect someone like North, who, after all, is the person 
official Washington least respects?  
</P>
<P>
 If only it were that simple. With 45% of Virginia voters expressing a negative 
opinion of North, according to Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research, he is one 
of the most polarizing political figures in the state's history. Divisions that 
deep are relatively new to a state that prefers its politicians to exhibit all 
the personality of a dead fish. "North," says Alan Secrest, who has polled 
Virginia voters on behalf of Democratic House candidates, "stands out like a 
sore thumb in the panoply of Virginia political figures. But then, so does 
Chuck Robb."  
</P>
<P>
 That's Charles S. Robb, (the C.S. stands for "Clinton Supporter," North likes 
to joke.) Former leading light of Virginia's Democratic politics. Upstanding 
former Marine who served combat duty in Vietnam. Married to L.B.J.'s daughter 
Lynda Bird Johnson. So popular was he as governor that "in 1985 he would have 
won near-unanimously if Virginia allowed consecutive terms," according to the 
Almanac of American Politics. When he was elected to the Senate in 1988, there 
was talk that he (not Bill Clinton) would be the figure to create a winning 
center-right coalition in the Democratic Party. His fall from grace was swift 
and ugly. During the past few years, Robb has answered rumors of extramarital 
affairs and attendance at drug parties with responses so tortuous he's become 
the butt of jokes among supporters as well as detractors. (His assertion that 
he "hadn't slept with anyone" other than his wife led to ribald speculation 
about his preferred sexual activities.)  
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, Robb's campaign for reelection has been notable for what it 
lacks. He has raised only a fraction of North's war chest and isn't nearly as 
visible on the campaign trail, a problem his aides attribute to a heavy Senate 
schedule. Robb appears to be banking heavily on a round of TV spots to run in 
the last weeks of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 All this should make the senator an easy target for North, but this is 
Virginia, home to chief architects of the Declaration of Independence and the 
U.S. Constitution. North's celebrity status actually carries him further in 
other parts of the country: A June U.S. News & World Report poll found that 45% 
of Americans have a favorable opinion of North, in contrast to 37% with a 
negative opinion. Virginia may be one of the most conservative states in the 
Union, home to national religious-right organizations and a wide variety of 
residents with military ties. But it is also one that turns a cold shoulder to 
anyone perceived to be messing with America's historical traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Or with its democratic system of checks and balances. Many voters have not 
forgotten that as a junior official in the White House's National Security 
Council, North skirted congressional prohibitions on involvement in Nicaragua's 
civil war by funneling millions of dollars to the Contras. Who in the White 
House knew what when -- and to what extent North was acting under orders -- is 
still a matter of contention. But this much is clear: In 1989, he was convicted 
of misleading members of Congress about his activities, shredding documents to 
hide evidence and accepting a gratuity in the form of a $13,800 security gate 
from a businessman who profited from the gun-runs. (North said he needed the 
gate to protect his family against terrorists.) A federal appeals court later 
reversed one conviction and set aside the others because of concerns that his 
five days of testimony before Congress, for which he was given immunity from 
prosecution, had prevented him from getting a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 North has also admitted to being involved in selling arms to Iranian 
intermediaries in return for using their influence to release American hostages 
held by Middle East terrorists. Three hostages were released, but three more 
were taken, suggesting the validity of the stated U.S. policy that negotiating 
with terrorists only puts American lives at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 North's "I-made-mistakes-to-save-lives" response to these charges is part of 
the myth he has constructed around himself. If he acted unwisely, he did it in 
answering to a higher calling, not succumbing to personal weakness, like Robb 
or even President Clinton. His ads portray him as a war hero who saved the 
lives of his men. And at campaign stops, this is the line North relishes 
repeating: "I've never broken a commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I am standing in the shadow of a 20-foot rubber duck. A band in the background 
is doing a passable imitation of the Marshall Tucker Band. And North press aide 
Dan McLagan, blue-jeaned veteran of campaigns for former President George Bush 
and other major candidates, is telling me that he works for the "most honest, 
believable, trustworthy candidate I've ever seen."  
</P>
<P>
 North never sought out the wealth and fame accorded him after the Iran-Contra 
hearings, McLagan notes. "He was put $9 million in debt. It ended his career as 
a Marine officer, which is all he ever wanted to do. Just because he 
persevered, the media seems to be upset about that, like they didn't bury him 
deep enough." 
</P>
<P>
 In the world of good and evil that Ollie North has bisected for himself, the 
media clearly fall into the latter. "The people are a lot nicer, and the press 
is just as vicious as I always expected it to be," North says in reflecting on 
his first campaign. On the stump, he gets plenty of laughs at the expense of 
the New York Crimes, the Washington Compost, the Nasty Broadcasting Company. He 
elicits the same rounds of hearty guffaws when he attacks the "potentates of 
pork" in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver North's appeal stands as a testament to the success of Republican 
strategists who for years have longed to transform deeply rooted American 
populist sentiments against the rich and big business into populism that 
opposes big government and the liberal media. To his supporters at the 
Fredericksburg park this Saturday afternoon, North is the little guy who stood 
up to the faceless, corrupt machine and almost got crushed. He captures their 
own feelings of helplessness, of being cut out of the political system, the 
press, even decisions in their own schools and workplaces. Questions about the 
Iran-Contra affair elicit responses with an underlying message of: Let's not be 
naive, we know how the real world works -- The little guy always gets screwed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lonely lieutenant colonel taking the whole fall for a big incident like 
that?" asks a skeptical Mitchell Wood, as he shifts his 4-year-old son's weight 
around on top of his shoulders. "That didn't seem to cut it with me. I work for 
a Marine base. I'm a civilian worker there. I see what happens to the little 
guy. If something happens, you ain't gonna see the upper management go down the 
tunnel. Lt. Col. North was at the bottom of the ladder. No general had to go 
into those hearings. The President didn't even have to show up."  
</P>
<P>
 As North makes his way through this crowd, there's a lot of give-and-take 
between him and people like Woods. Many of his fans speak forcefully of church 
and prayer. "God love ya, 'preciate that," he'll respond to offers of 
encouragement. According to supporters here and elsewhere, Virginia churches 
play a strong role in turning out voters to North events.  
</P>
<P>
 North, a former Catholic who now belongs to an evangelical Episcopalian 
church, was born again in the early 1970s after a near-divorce and an emotional 
breakdown that left him hospitalized for 22 days in Bethesda Naval Hospital. 
After a back injury, North recalls in his first book, a friend and Marine 
superior cured him with the power of prayer. Since then North -- who still 
admits to working long hours that leave little family time -- has found God and 
renewed appreciation for his family. He routinely calls his wife, Betsy, his 
"best friend" and always reminds himself that his four children, ranging in age 
from 12 to 25, are "on loan from God."  
</P>
<P>
 Robb, though, wants to portray him as a less-than-holy crusader, calling his 
opponent someone who "has had real problems with the truth." This accusation 
hits home harder than most political mud-slinging because a number of North's 
former colleagues have also expressed concerns recently about his credibility. 
Gen. Colin L. Powell, retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has been 
quoted saying he wouldn't feel "comfortable" with North in the Senate. Former 
National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane has publicly branded North a 
liar. U.S. Army Gen. John K. Singlaub, a Contra supporter, told Reader's Digest 
that North "told lies and got away with it." A number of stories North has 
told, featuring his alleged personal access to important figures such as Reagan 
and the late CIA Director William J. Casey, have been challenged. North has 
responded by saying that different people recall events differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Bradlee Jr.'s biography, "Guts and Glory," presents North as a Marine 
combat officer, and later a training instructor at Quantico, who had a flair 
for the dramatics and knew how to tell superiors what they wanted to hear. One 
retired Marine described his former colleague to Bradlee as "a mile wide and an 
inch deep . . . Ollie liked the limelight -- he liked briefing (generals)." His 
superiors, on the other hand, recall a gung-ho, can-do officer who got the job 
done without a lot of fuss.  
</P>
<P>
 That's the Ollie North the crowd today wants to see as they await the upcoming 
rubber duck race on Fredericksburg's Rappahannock River, an annual GOP 
fund-raiser. "He was an excellent Marine. He did his job," Kathy Zimmerman says 
in the clipped tones of a military wife. "He knew how to follow orders. He did 
what was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend chimes in: "He's an American hero."  
</P>
<P>
 If his Marine's code of honor has appeal, North's image as a conservative 
martyr crushed by an "imperial Congress" and "hostile media" takes him even 
further nationally. After his 1987 appearance before Congress, North collected 
enough money from around the country to cover a $9-million legal fee and then 
some. His national fund-raising machine remains formidable: With the help of 
out-of-state events and direct-mail appeals, North raised more than $8 million 
for his campaign by last June, and since then he continues to mine a list of 
donors to bring in millions more. 
</P>
<P>
 But he remains a divisive figure even within his own political party. Last 
spring, when North was narrowly nominated, some Republicans couldn't forgive a 
man who laid the blame for Iran-Contra squarely at the foot of his popular 
commander-in-chief, asserting in his book that Reagan knew all. Reagan himself 
earlier this year responded with a letter to former Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada, 
complaining that he was getting "pretty steamed" after hearing North's version 
of events. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost among North's Republican critics is Virginia's other senator, John 
Warner, better known nationally as Elizabeth Taylor husband No. 7. Warner 
endorsed the alternative Republican candidate in this race, Marshall Coleman, 
who is running as an independent. Coleman, a former lieutenant governor who has 
the clean good looks of a local TV anchor, has a tiny paid staff and a fraction 
of North's money. Still, by early October he has moved up in the polls from the 
single digits to about 18%, and he insists he'll continue his campaign because 
Virginians deserve a better choice. At a campaign stop at the foot of the 
Shenandoah Mountains, he seemed a lonely figure as he ducked into a restaurant 
to shake hands, two aides at his side. "I think North abused his oath of office 
and abused the public office he served in," Coleman says. "That is what is 
keeping most Virginians from supporting him." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so. But as autumn wore on, the prospect of capturing control of the 
Senate proved too mouth-watering for most Republicans to stay away from North 
for long. One by one, key GOP figures have come home to roost in North's nest: 
Bush, Laxalt, former Reagan Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III and former Reagan Chief 
of Staff James A. Baker III. But probably the most symbolic show of support 
came from Washington's quintessential insider, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, 
who initially expressed public doubts about endorsing North but campaigned with 
him last month.  
</P>
<P>
 North bristles at press accounts portraying Dole's endorsement as less than 
enthusiastic -- another example, he says, of how the hostile media won't give 
him a break. But he acknowledges that Dole's support "is probably as much 
political as it was personal. He's a guy who really wants to get a Republican 
majority. He knows I'm a partisan. I'm not trying to marry Bob Dole, I just 
want him to be majority leader."  
</P>
<P>
 As the Republican boat tips toward North, Warner may find himself out in the 
cold. Privately, some Republicans are accusing Warner of betraying the party at 
a critical point in history. Suggesting that the heat is on, Warner campaigned 
for Coleman one week in September; by the next week, his press secretary said 
he didn't have time for a brief interview about the race.  
</P>
<P>
 Even with the support among big-name Republicans, North will need all the 
Reagan-esque charm he can muster to expand his support beyond his hard-core 
base of 25%-30% and top Robb in next month's vote. Wilder, the more lively 
former governor, dropped out of the race in mid-September, leaving Robb and 
North neck-and-neck in a campaign almost as depressing to Virginians as 
Louisiana's 1991 gubernatorial race, when voters had to choose between a man 
twice acquitted of racketeering charges and a former member of the Ku Klux 
Klan. "I hate like heck to see Virginia compared to Louisiana," complains 
political science professor Rozell. "This state has such a sense of history. 
It's disturbing to have elections like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Leesburg, I'd asked North how often he encounters voters who react 
strongly against him. "Oh, I'd say one out of every couple hundred or so," he 
responds, looking intently for another open restaurant to descend upon. "It's 
politics. If people have a thin skin . . . I don't know if you noticed, but 
sitting on our dashboard is the state bird of Texas, the armadillo." 
</P>
<P>
 North likes to remind his voters that his "hometown" is San Antonio, Tex. It 
goes over well in this Southern border state, like the cowboy boots and the 
trace of accent. But it's all part of the Ollie myth. North was born in San 
Antonio. He grew up in a small town in Upstate New York. He hasn't lived in 
Texas since he was 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after the Fredericksburg visit, Rolling Thunder is barreling down 
the two-lane highways of Virginia's Southside, which runs along the state's 
border with North Carolina. "You've got to see North campaign in southern 
Virginia," a Republican friend exhorted me. "Down there, they throw themselves 
across the railroad tracks for him."  
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. But the enthusiasm is palpable. "North came here two years ago," 
recalls Sylvia McLaughlin, editor of the News & Record in South Boston, a 
red-brick industrial town of textile mills and wood-processing plants about 70 
miles southeast of Roanoke. "People who wouldn't pay $5 for a school 
fund-raiser paid $25 a plate to see him! He got a standing ovation." 
</P>
<P>
 At this end of the state, where the accents churn as thick as peanut soup, 
North has left behind the security car that normally tails him. Instead, his 
blue and white motor home leads a procession of reporters and local officials 
scurrying behind in their own cars. Midway through the morning, Rolling Thunder 
pulls to the side of the road and North wades into a field of droopy-eared 
tobacco leaves so that the local paper can take his picture with the farm's 
owner. The photographer asks for North's autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 This is conservative country; nearby Prince Edwards' County is where Sen. 
Harry Flood Byrd Jr. shut down the public schools in 1957 rather than obey a 
federal court desegregation order. But it's also still tied to its partisan 
roots and sent a tobacco Democrat, Lewis F. Payne, to Congress three times in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 We pass by peanut farms and pine forests and tobacco fields, through 
communities so small the mail is delivered by a federal car. The food stores on 
the highways outside tiny Chase City are fronted by '50s-era gas pumps and 
still have names like Whitten Bros. and Stone's General Store -- not 7-Eleven. 
The main drag of another town, South Hill, is pockmarked by econo-motels and 
fast-food chains, but the locals still prefer to swap gossip at Brian's 
Steakhouse, where the waitress calls her customers "shug" and delivers a hearty 
breakfast for a buck-fifty. 
</P>
<P>
 In a South Hill parking lot, North warms up his autograph hand while he wades 
through a sea of fishing caps and Wrangler jeans. Already this year, he has 
signed T-shirts and shoes, bumper stickers and baby packs, books and photos. At 
a county fair last summer he signed a pig. This morning, a World War II veteran 
hands him his hat -- USS Missouri, Tokyo Bay, 1945. If you don't have a special 
memento for his signature, North will pull out his own specialized autograph 
card. Turning it sideways, his left hand awkwardly pulling the letters upward, 
he traces a friendly but dramatic "Ollie." In his books, he often inscribes the 
Marine motto semper fi , "always faithful."  
</P>
<P>
 When the crush subsides, North looks up and says, seemingly to no one in 
particular, "Is there a pickup?" And within seconds, his efficient, hiply 
dressed young aides have cleared a pathway to a truck; North's boots lift him 
onto the tailgate and he starts talking. "Can't hear!" someone calls from the 
back. "Well, fill in," North says, waving the crowd forward. "This isn't 
church. We're not going to take up a collection." Everyone laughs 
appreciatively and the bond is sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 North's stump speech isn't innovative. Cut taxes, cut big government, impose 
term limits, throw out the liberals who want to destroy our military. At times, 
when he seems to have run out of things to say, his thoughts start sounding 
like political cliches ("millstone of debt," "rising tide of red ink") linked 
together only by strings of non sequiturs.  
</P>
<P>
 Even with this crowd, though, North doesn't mention the words abortion or guns 
. There's no point in handing over any ammo to the enemy as he tries to broaden 
his base. Instead, he talks in a strange kind of code, decrying the Clinton 
Administration for altering the First Amendment "so that certain people can't 
gather in front of certain buildings" (read: the Justice Department's 
enforcement of prohibitions on abortion-clinic blockades). He adds to that the 
assertion that Clinton is revising the Second Amendment "so that certain things 
that look a certain way can no longer be purchased by certain people" (read: 
the ban on assault weapons contained in the crime bill just signed by the 
President). 
</P>
<P>
 North's appeal is less in what he says than how he says it. He's been called 
charismatic. Actually, it's more accurate to call this mysterious aura his 
humanity. He has an honest rapport with "folks," as he calls them, that is 
stronger even than his considerable TV appeal. He can be one of the guys with 
veterans, swapping places and battle dates as if they were baseball cards. He 
can be the earnest son, telling an elderly woman that her Social Security pay 
raises are a "vested entitlement" owed to "folks like you and my mom." And, as 
someone who has been vigorously stumping for other Republican candidates in 
Virginia for three years, he knows his local politics inside and out. He talks 
rural routes and water rights with the ease of a born-and-bred Virginian. Today 
in South Hill, Mary Davidson, a bookkeeper and former kindergarten teacher, 
wants to test that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "At work I have the picture he sent me of his wife and family and dog. I like 
him. There's no b---s--- about him," Davidson tells me. "But that pipeline 
thang. That's the only thang. They want to steal water from our lake! I'm gonna 
vote for him if he will stay out of that." Davidson is referring to a pipeline 
that threatens to divert water from a nearby recreational lake and ship it off 
to the growing metropolitan area of Virginia Beach. But she's too nervous to 
ask the colonel; he is, after all, a national celebrity. So I offer to raise it 
for her as North makes his way through the adoring crowd.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the federal government ought to get the dickens out of it and make 
sure the governor does the right thing by the people at both ends," he tells 
Davidson without missing a beat, "to make sure the landowners in the periphery 
and the sportsmen that use it won't be hurt by it. We sure don't need the 
federal government negotiating -- they couldn't even solve a baseball strike." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Mary Davidson is concerned, Ollie North has just hit a home run. 
She's satisfied, thrilled even, with his answer. As North moves on, Davidson 
whispers to me in a conspiratorial tone, "I'm just glad he didn't wear his 
suit-coat. He needs to be casual 'round these parts." 
</P>
<P>
 It's days before former President Jimmy Carter's peaceful agreement with the 
Haitian military junta, and war is in the air as President Clinton readies the 
U.S. military for an invasion of the Caribbean island. On the campaign trail, 
North has begun his exhortation that "Clinton's poll numbers are not worth one 
drop of American blood." 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, North, who stoked the civil war in Nicaragua and helped push the 
American invasion of tiny Grenada despite the objections of the administration 
of the American medical school there, is telling me there is "no rational 
justification" for an invasion of Haiti. "If American lives are at risk, if 
American vital interests are at risk. . . . But this isn't Grenada. There is no 
comparison. We had 804 medical students. I know, I was there. It just doesn't 
make sense. If you want to bring about a democratic solution in a place like 
Haiti, you don't need 20,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines." 
</P>
<P>
 What would he do about Haiti as a U.S. senator? "I would have demanded 
hearings. And we'll have a (Republican) majority up there and we ought to have 
hearings."  
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted Haitian leader that Clinton wants to return 
to power, is no friend of the American right. So the first part of North's 
answer comes as no surprise. The second part, however, where he highlights the 
importance of congressional oversight in matters of war, is more than a little 
jarring to hear, given North's history. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the candidate has the opportunity to answer any more questions, the 
voice of an elderly woman suddenly fills the air. "I'm a praying person," she 
calls out as she walks to her car, gray hair in a neat bun, eyes avoiding 
direct contact with North. "And let me tell you, I'm going to pray: God, save 
us from Ollie North!" 
</P>
<P>
 As she settles into her station wagon, its rear bumper just inches from 
North's right calf, an aide interrupts the candidate. "Let's get out of here," 
the aide says, "before she gets the wrong idea."  
</P>
<P>
 Quickly and efficiently, he ushers North across the parking lot and they 
retreat into the privacy of Rolling Thunder, confident they're on the road to 
Washington.

THE STRANGE FAITH OF DR. CORDER; HE BELIEVES THAT ALIENS WALK AMONG US AND THE 
APOCOLYPSE IS NIGH. BUT DOES THAT MEAN HE ISN'T A GOOD DOCTOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stephen Braun, Stephen Braun is a staff writer in the Times' Chicago bureau. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everything was fine as long as Dr. Corder kept his strange thoughts to 
himself. When they finally tumbled out, there was hell to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 A respected country doctor with a stable practice spread through two counties, 
Scott Corder passed his days among the elderly and infirm of Ottawa, a town of 
more than 10,000 in the gently sloping farmland of eastern Kansas. Setting 
fractures, listening to congested chests, he was the sort of responsible 
physician who never went anywhere without a pager in his belt. 
</P>
<P>
 But the doctor was a walking Pandora's Box. 
</P>
<P>
 Dizzying cosmic notions teemed inside him, an entire religion replete with 
space aliens and angels and warnings of Armageddon. After almost a decade of 
building his practice, Corder knew that telling the world about his revelations 
from beyond might make him a laughingstock. But there was so much to tell: that 
the vanguard of an alien race was already among us to pave the way for either a 
lasting peace or permanent darkness. That Corder himself was one of the 
"Chosen," earthlings implanted with monitoring devices to prepare for the 
coming of the spaceships. That while Corder wolfed down a hamburger at the 
Sonic Drive-In one night, none other than the Apostle Peter, returned from a 
distant solar system to hasten Earth's new age, had caught his eye and winked 
at him. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of his life, Scott Corder, now 43, had been an agnostic, more 
familiar with Gray's Anatomy than with the Bible. But now he had gospel to 
spread. The doctor told his family. He told patients. He told the Pentagon. He 
told the Weekly World News. Then, in December, 1988, he sat down in a Topeka 
conference room to tell officials of the Kansas Board of Healing Arts. From 
that moment on, the doctor paid dearly for his message. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed at what they perceived as a public menace, state medical authorities 
ordered Corder to submit to a psychiatric examination. He refused and was 
stripped of his physician's license. In his practice, the doctor had shown no 
warning signs of impaired judgment. Yet as a private citizen, he seemed to be 
mouthing madness. Could a physician make life-and-death decisions while giving 
himself over to a belief system ruled by aliens? Did health authorities have 
the obligation to intervene in the affairs of such a professional, even though 
he showed no sign of diminished capacity? 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know what's going on in someone's mind," says Richard G. Gannon, 
the former healing arts board executive director. "We wanted to know and he 
didn't want to let us in." 
</P>
<P>
 The demarcation between madness and religious beatitude is often blurry. 
Interviewed by six psychiatrists over a four-year period, Corder became his own 
Rorschach test -- the inky flow from his mind allowed for any interpretation. 
Some saw the construct of lunacy. Others saw the odd, yet sane, flowering of 
religious devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty over Corder's fitness as a doctor led medical regulators to move 
quickly against him. But in their haste to weed out a doctor they saw as a 
public threat, Corder's lawyers now allege, Kansas officials deprived Corder of 
a proper hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole process was so totalitarian," says Alan V. Johnson, one of Corder's 
attorneys. "They were after him because his beliefs were strange." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, they decided he was sane and restored his license. The doctor 
returned to a shrunken practice, still believing in UFOs and angelic visitors, 
awaiting vindication in a lawsuit now before the Kansas Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm after vengeance now," Corder says in his cramped examining room in 
Ottawa. It is an old office, cluttered with used equipment and pervaded by a 
sense of defeat -- yellowing wallpaper, wheezing air conditioners, battered 
files piled high with medication samples. Only Corder's own private icons, 
framed photographs of UFOs and space scenes on his office wall, testify to his 
lingering defiance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want my name in front of them for as long as possible. I want them to 
remember the name of Scott Corder every time they think about disciplining a 
doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, though, when he wished they had never seen it. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "THEY'RE COMING!" 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing Steve French noticed was the headline. Reading on, he saw a 
familiar name: Dr. Scott Corder. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a Saturday, Dec., 3, 1988. French was shopping at a supermarket outside 
Topeka. An investigator for the Kansas Board of Healing Arts, French searched 
medical and pharmaceutical files each week for evidence to use against addicted 
and incompetent doctors. There were 6,800 physicians in Kansas and the push was 
on to get tough with them. 
</P>
<P>
 As he moved along the checkout line, French found himself drawn to a copy of 
the Weekly World News and its diet of Elvis sightings, Hitler clones and freak 
babies. Leafing through the tabloid, he paused at Page 9 to scan a story about 
a central Kansas woman named Donna Butts, who claimed she met with aliens every 
day. There was a photograph and caption with the story: "Space alien invasion 
only three years away, says top UFO expert." 
</P>
<P>
 The expert, staring drowsily from behind thick glasses, was Dr. Scott Corder. 
</P>
<P>
 French knew the name and face. The investigator had been running down leads on 
"professional patients," addicts and dealers who sweet-talked doctors into 
writing narcotics prescriptions. Scott Corder was one of the physicians 
allegedly duped. That Monday, French mentioned Corder's name to his superiors. 
The executive director of the board, Richard G. Gannon, was intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already had information that he was giving out Dilaudid prescriptions 
improperly and Steve said, 'Look at what he's doing now,' " Gannon recalls. "We 
clearly had to have him in for a talk." 
</P>
<P>
 A retired Democratic state senator from rural western Kansas, the 
silver-haired Gannon, not yet 40, was coming on like a prairie fire to rid the 
state of troublesome doctors whose crimes ranged from incompetence to 
alcoholism and cocaine addiction. A newly passed malpractice-reform law had 
boosted the agency's budget and staff, and Gannon, the new executive, was 
expected to show results. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor really wanted action," Gannon says. "The Kansas medical society, 
the docs, they wanted it, too. The public demanded it. There just wasn't any 
more room for bad or incompetent doctors in Kansas." 
</P>
<P>
 In Gannon's view, Corder's casual dispensing of prescriptions was worrisome 
but hardly flagrant. Rather, it was Corder's obsession with UFOs that was the 
potential danger signal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gannon decided to order Corder to meet with him and investigators the next 
day. Corder was in his office in Ottawa when the telephone rang. He was alarmed 
at the mention of prescriptions. But when the board's lawyer told him of their 
interest in his statements about UFOs, Corder grew excited. He sensed 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "BELIEVE nothing because it is said to be of divine origin. BELIEVE nothing 
because a wise man said it. BELIEVE nothing because its belief is generally 
held. BELIEVE nothing because it is written in ancient books. BELIEVE nothing 
because someone else believes it. BUT believe only what you yourself know to be 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 The message, from the Apostle Peter himself, had been relayed through the 
celestial messenger's earthly conduit, Donna Butts. Corder had called her after 
hearing from the board. Over the phone, she dictated Peter's personal message 
to the officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor typed it out on his medical stationery and took it and a dog-eared 
Bible with him to Topeka the next morning. He wore his dark-blue 
polyester-blend suit, the only one he owned. His hair, slightly shaggy, was 
combed down. He wanted to make a good impression. 
</P>
<P>
 There were four of them waiting for him: French, Joseph M. Furjanic, a board 
lawyer, and two others who, Corder later testified in court, were never 
identified to him. They were Dr. Glenn Swogger Jr. and Dr. Dean Collins, two 
psychiatrists from the Menninger Clinic, a world-renowned hospital and 
psychiatric training facility in Topeka. Gannon wanted Swogger and Collins in 
attendance that day "to figure out what we were dealing with." 
</P>
<P>
 Corder's lawyer, Johnson, would claim later that the board's failure to 
identify the psychiatrists to Corder and explain their presence deprived the 
doctor of his right to a proper hearing. But according to Gannon, Furjanic set 
the agenda. Swogger understood that the doctors were present only in "an 
advisory role," not to make a formal diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions about Corder's prescribing habits were cleared up quickly after 
Corder agreed to supply the names of patients he thought might be abusing 
prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gannon slipped into the room as the conversation wound down. He had been 
wondering how to subtly bring up the subject of aliens, but Corder did it for 
him. "I thought you wanted to talk about UFOs," the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 They sat back as Corder explained his discovery. Handing the others the 
message from Peter, the doctor explained that through his own amateur 
investigations into the UFO phenomenon, he had stumbled upon an astounding 
revelation: Extraterrestrials had divine origins. And Donna Butts, a part-time 
cleaning woman from Russell, was their earthly link. 
</P>
<P>
 Corder explained that he had never seen the aliens himself. But Butts had, 
dozens of times. On a car trip in central Kansas in 1980, she saw a spaceship. 
Then, four years later, she began getting regular visits from a celestial being 
who called himself Cephas, but he was actually the Apostle Peter. The holy 
messenger had returned from M-31, a remote star in the Andromeda galaxy, to 
prepare Earth's civilization for a golden age -- if the world accepted the 
teachings he provided through Donna Butts. The alternative was a hellish 
apocalypse of nuclear war, disease and chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Butts had told Corder that both of them had been selected to apprise the world 
of the coming of the aliens. Their progress was being monitored by "monotrons" 
implanted into their bodies by the aliens at birth. Cephas and other visiting 
beings were "Amorcans," benign humanoids who travel through the cosmos in 
pyramid-shaped vessels. They poured their heady knowledge into Donna Butts, 
filling her up like a wineskin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was convinced she had a direct link to a phenomenon that had the answers 
for mankind," Corder says . "How could you keep something like that a secret?" 
</P>
<P>
 When the doctor was done, Gannon leaned back in his executive chair and 
motioned to the fifth-floor window overlooking the state capital and the 
streets of Topeka. "You know, it's a big world out there, a big universe, and 
there could possibly be other life out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea that some woman in Russell was communicating with beings from 
M-31 was out of the question. Corder heard Gannon say that "since we are 
responsible for licensing physicians in Kansas, this sort of thing reflects 
back on us." Then drawing close to the doctor, Gannon added: "You know, you 
need to be more careful about who you talk to about all this." 
</P>
<P>
 It was merely a bit of paternalistic advice. "So help me, I felt sorry for the 
guy," Gannon says. "He was clearly embarrassing himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Corder read it another way. He shook hands with the regulators when the 
meeting ended. On the way to his car, he mulled over Gannon's words. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want my license revoked," Corder recalls. "They just wanted me to 
keep my mouth shut. So I did." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It was the lights in the sky that first made him wonder. Corder had been 
curious about UFOs ever since his youth in Highland, Kan. At night, he and his 
brothers peered up from their bedroom windows. The cobalt-blue firmament was 
flush with stars. Airplanes and streaking meteorites were easy to pick out. But 
there were also objects they had never seen before -- mysterious, otherworldly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd see a light in the sky and wonder what it was doing there," recalls Mark 
Corder, one of Scott's older brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Maturing, the brothers put their childhood fascination aside. Like his father, 
a general practitioner, Scott Corder took his medical degree at the University 
of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 One winter day in 1978, during his senior year of residency at St. Luke's and 
Mercy Hospital in Davenport, Iowa, Corder noticed an advertisement for a 
lecture by J. Allen Hynek, a Northwestern University astronomer who ran a UFO 
research organization. The name struck a chord. Corder had read Hynek's book, 
"The UFO Experience," in high school. Corder went that night for "the 
entertainment," watching while the elderly Hynek debated sightings with his 
audience. Soon after, Corder signed on with the group. For months, Corder's 
reports about alleged UFO sightings in the Kansas area were "routine, the usual 
questions and speculation we tend to get from our people," says Jerome Clark, 
vice president of the Center for UFO Studies, located in Chicago. But then, 
suddenly, Corder's letters grew long-winded, webbed with outlandish 
pronouncements. He had found Donna Butts. 
</P>
<P>
 Corder had learned about her in a letter from another UFO center official. 
"They said they were getting letters from a lady in Kansas who made some 
strange claims." Corder says. "They were worried about her psyche." 
</P>
<P>
 Butts lived on the ramshackle farm property that she and her truck driver 
husband rented, raising five children. Sometimes, she cleaned houses. 
Sometimes, she cared for elderly. Sometimes, she had visions. 
</P>
<P>
 Corder had a lot to lose by listening to Butts. After seven years in Ottawa, 
he had become a familiar fixture in its nursing homes and tiny hospital, Ransom 
Memorial. Aging patients prized his bedside manner. Len Daugherty, at that time 
Ransom's administrator, regarded Corder as one of the "best diagnosis men in 
town." 
</P>
<P>
 But after meeting Donna, Corder changed. He was on the phone constantly with 
her, recalls his former receptionist, Delma Mavity. He taped up space-themed 
items on his office walls. There were photographs of Earth, the space shuttle, 
a blurry UFO sighting. There was a sign that read: "Jesus Loves You." Some 
patients gossiped about Corder's newfound obsession, but most were willing to 
endure the strange office decor, even Corder's talk of UFOs, as long as his 
care held up. 
</P>
<P>
 Word that Corder claimed to have met the Apostle Peter at the Sonic Drive-In 
drew a few gawkers to the hamburger stand. But most Ottawans took his 
pronouncements in stride. This was a county with 64 churches; one more, even 
with celestial origins, could be accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heavenly days," says Mary Anne Whiteford, head of the Ottawa Community Arts 
Council and one of Corder's patients, "this is still a free country. Everyone 
can believe as they wish, no matter how strange it seems to the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
 At home, Corder's wife, Barbara, a schoolteacher, also tolerated his 
increasingly strange beliefs. "I like to read about the different sightings and 
all the stories," she says. "But I wouldn't give my job up for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other family members were less forgiving. Corder had married and divorced 
twice before he met Barbara, and his new beliefs seemed to further alienate him 
from his families. An older daughter from Corder's first marriage stopped 
speaking to him. And his second wife told brother Mark Corder that she wanted 
Scott to stay away from their son, in part because of his new beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Scott Corder had a new family of sorts. Each time he made the nearly 
four-hour drive to Russell, he found people who validated his growing belief in 
UFOs. A small coterie of schoolteachers and farmers' wives began showing up at 
Butts' home. They, too, claimed to have seen the spaceships. 
</P>
<P>
 In Russell, there were rumors of an impending exodus to the spaceships in 
advance of Armageddon. It was like the story of Noah's Ark, only this time, it 
seemed that the deluge would last only a week. The chosen were told by Butts to 
pack seven pairs of cotton socks, seven pairs of underwear, seven shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no exodus, and the doubters eventually wore Donna Butts down. 
Claiming harassment and death threats, she and her family moved to Georgia in 
early 1992. These days, she keeps her miracles to herself. When telephoned 
recently at a Georgia number supplied by her mother-in-law, Butts at first 
expressed interest in Corder's plight, then abruptly insisted that she was 
another Donna Butts. "She doesn't want to talk about it anymore," June Butts 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
 But back on a warm day -- May 13, 1987 -- Corder cast away his own last shreds 
of doubt. He knew Butts' tales sounded crazy. But after weeks of interviews, 
after his own medical examinations of the woman, he was convinced her fantastic 
talk of Armageddon was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, surrounded by UFO tomes and scrapbooks thick with his 
correspondence, Corder gave in to the rapture. It swept over him with the 
electric shudder of a born-again conversion. Ecstatic with joy, he wept for 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had found out the answer to the UFO mystery and I was elated," Corder says. 
"UFOs were spiritual things. They existed in faith. From that point on, it was 
my duty to tell the world." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not even three months after Corder told Richard Gannon he would keep his 
beliefs to himself, Corder was in deep trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor had sent a letter to federal officials at the Pentagon. Dated Feb. 
15, 1989, it warned of a new prediction from Peter, relayed through Butts. 
President Bush was in danger of assassination. "This is a prediction and NOT a 
threat," Corder wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Secret Service was called in anyway. It found no threat but handed the 
matter over to the healing arts board. Alarmed at Corder's indiscretion, Gannon 
ordered him to meet with Glenn Swogger at Menninger's. Failure to comply, 
Gannon said curtly, would lead to immediate suspension of his license. 
</P>
<P>
 Swogger began to probe gently after Corder settled himself into an office 
armchair. Suspicious, Corder parried with terse answers. Corder found Swogger 
"aloof, doubting. You could tell by his expressions he was down on what I said. 
And I was very defensive. My career and my life were on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 As the session progressed, Swogger found himself concluding that Corder showed 
evidence of a "florid" delusional system, a web of fantasy, but at that time, 
it did not appear to affect Corder's daily working life. "People can have 
delusions while the rest of their personality is intact," Swogger says. But 
what he saw in Corder worried him. Swogger felt that he "was seeing signs of 
leakage" in Corder's obsessions, possibly affecting his work. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, in a follow-up meeting between Corder and another Menninger 
psychiatrist, Dr. Joseph Hyland, Swogger's fears appeared to be confirmed. 
Corder, convinced he was about to committed involuntarily to the clinic, 
stormed out of the interview after only a few minutes. "I had done my part to 
explain myself to them," Corder says. "It went downhill from the moment I 
walked in. At one point, he said: 'We want to help you get rid of your bizarre 
beliefs, but you'll be able to keep your Christian beliefs. You have a bizarre 
thinking disorder.' I knew what that meant, all right. That I was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyland, who has since died, jotted down in his notes that the doctor would 
require "inpatient hospitalization." If he refused, Hyland had told Corder 
before he left, "he could expect to have his license suspended." 
</P>
<P>
 But both Swogger and Hyland based part of their analysis on unverified rumors 
that called into question Corder's ability to function as a doctor. According 
to one report relayed to the investigators by Corder's brother Mark, a lawyer 
in nearby Olathe, the doctor had approached a worker at an Ottawa nursing home 
and asked her to look into his ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to know if she could see a monitor in his head," Mark Corder says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark urged Scott to see a psychiatrist and secretly asked a local judge about 
the possibility of committing Scott to a psychiatric ward. But no one from the 
board called the nursing home or Ransom Memorial Hospital to decide whether the 
doctor had ever acted inappropriately. "There was never any attempt by the 
board to do what it is supposed to do: determine whether Scott's beliefs 
affected his ability to practice medicine," says his lawyer, Alan Johnson. "If 
they did, this case would never have gone forward." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, before Corder lost his license, Len Daugherty, Ransom's 
administrator, grew so worried about the hospital's liability that he ordered 
an internal review of Corder's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went back over his charts. We spent 20 days going over his cases," 
Daugherty says. "There was not a single problem. He did everything any 
conscientious doctor would do. And his patients loved him." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Gannon insists that he had no obligation to research Corder's record 
as a doctor. The psychiatrists' concerns, he says, were sufficient to cause 
alarm. It was Corder's future actions, not his past performance, that concerned 
Gannon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the opinions of Glenn Swogger and Joseph Hyland were not the only 
psychiatric views of Scott Corder. Mark Corder had persuaded his brother to see 
a psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Nash, and a psychologist, Dr. Fowler C. Jones. After 
a battery of mental tests, Jones concluded that Scott Corder was "preoccupied 
by his UFO interest but there was no evidence . . . to conclude he is a danger 
to his patients." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after being examined by Swogger, Corder was interviewed by another 
psychiatrist, John Wisner, who is also a Roman Catholic priest. Wisner 
concurred with Jones' finding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The failure here was the failure of a secular society," Wisner says. 
"Wouldn't it seem sensible to assess his performance as a doctor? That didn't 
happen, I think, because many psychiatrists today are reluctant to accept 
people's beliefs for what they are -- beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Misguided as some might think Corder's beliefs are, he is clearly not alone; 
millions of Americans believe that some of their countrymen have had encounters 
with aliens. Whitley Strieber's book, "Communion," was a bestseller and a 
popular film. Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack has gained more fame in the 
past year for his acceptance of UFO encounter claims than he did for two 
decades of less controversial psychiatric work. And UFO encounters are becoming 
a popular theme of junk culture. Two new TV shows, "Encounters: The Hidden 
Truth" and "The X-Files," have used UFO reports as grist for their story mills. 
</P>
<P>
 Within this culture, an enduring subculture has come to attach religious 
significance to aliens. Blending biblical citations and UFO cant, some claim to 
channel messages from aliens while others make a career of describing frequent 
UFO contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, says Jerome Clark of the Center for UFO Studies, the 
contactee movement has become a self-sustaining entity, churning out "hundreds 
of books and monographs and newsletters. Most of these people live in 
isolation, and they feed on each other." They can't talk to their family or 
neighbors about it, because that would bring the possibility of doubt, so they 
prop each other's beliefs up in letters and phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, some of them are charlatans," says Robert Fuller, professor of 
religious studies at Bradley University in Peoria, Ill., "but there's a 
tremendous excitement in thinking of yourself as a prophet." 
</P>
<P>
 As John Wisner listened to Corder, the doctor's epiphany was clearly evident. 
As a priest, Wisner had heard it before; it was the "kind of thing you see at a 
Youth for Christ rally every weekend." All Corder seemed to be doing was 
interpreting "a lot of everyday occurrences and relating them to the beliefs 
that had been revealed to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Wisner's finding, like those of the other psychiatrists, was itself only 
interpretation. But the conclusions of the Menninger analysts had the authority 
of the state behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after his disastrous meeting with Hyland, Corder's fate was sealed. 
Steve French and a woman from an impaired-physicians' counseling group, arrived 
at Corder's office with the notice of suspension. Corder asked if he could 
finish out the day with his patients. French shook his head and said no. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning red, Corder grabbed the suspension notice and waved it in French's 
face. "This," he said, "is an injustice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without his profession, Corder was a man adrift. Living only on Barbara's 
teaching salary, the couple lost their house. They moved with her two children 
into cheaper accommodations, a trailer outside of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Corder became a gentleman farmer. He grew turnips, beets, cabbages sunflowers. 
He erected a henhouse, filling it with shrieking chickens. He lost 15 pounds 
digging an underground shelter for the coming Armageddon and equipped it with 
solar power and a month's worth of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Legally, Corder was baffled. He tried to file his own lawsuit in federal court 
in Topeka, charging that his suspension was unconstitutional. But the judge 
threw it out, saying it should have been filed in state courts. Corder's 
approaches to local lawyers were unavailing until he found Alan Johnson, a 
Topeka corporate lawyer with an interest in constitutional rights cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson filed a motion with the federal district court in Topeka, alleging 
that Corder was deprived of his due-process rights to a full hearing. Corder 
won the right to go before the board, but that changed nothing. He still had to 
pass a full psychiatric review. The board insisted that Corder's license would 
be returned only after a Menninger psychiatrist verified his sanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Bit by bit, the doctor's resolve weakened. He agreed to see another Menninger 
psychiatrist. In March, 1992, Corder spent several sessions with psychiatrists 
inside the clinic's brick-walled infirmary. William Logan, the Menninger 
psychiatrist who examined him, notified state officials that Corder was fit to 
practice. On April 11, 1992, the board reinstated his license. 
</P>
<P>
 With seed money provided by Ransom Memorial, Corder returned to his practice. 
And he has built back more than half his old patient load. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved Dr. Corder," says one elderly Ottawan, a former patient. "But he 
still believes in UFOs, and as long as he does, how can I be certain he won't 
get into trouble?" 
</P>
<P>
 Others are more willing to forgive. "He charges less for a visit than the 
other doctors do, and he really knows his patients," says Marilyn Gilmore, a 
registered nurse who takes her children to Corder. "He has strange ideas, but 
as long as he doesn't force them on you, so what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Corder heard more good news in June, 1993. He won his lawsuit against the 
board. But it was a hollow victory. Corder was awarded $185,000 in damages but 
could not collect, since by the judge's ruling both Richard Gannon and the 
board were immune to liability. Johnson has appealed, and Corder has been 
waiting for word from the Kansas Supreme Court to learn whether he will win any 
compensation for his three years without work. 
</P>
<P>
 Corder still clings to his beliefs. But they, too, have begun to change. 
</P>
<P>
 His relationship with Donna Butts crumbled in September, 1991, during a 
chaotic trip he took to Israel with her and a Russell family. She had indicated 
that "a major prophecy" was about to take place in the Holy Land, and they were 
the only proper witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 They had planned to be gone for weeks, but a few days after a detoured journey 
to Jerusalem, Corder quietly returned home. His wife had finally lost patience. 
"She basically said if I stayed, she might not be there when I came home," 
Corder says. "I wasn't going to make that choice." 
</P>
<P>
 To Butts, Corder's departure was a betrayal. She severed all ties with him. In 
two years, they have not spoken. "That doctor," says June Butts, "he's gone 
over to the dark side." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Corder has his own movement now. He calls it the Church of the End 
Times. He is leader and congregation. He prints out grim warnings on his 
computer, quoting passages from Revelations and scorning society's growing 
reliance on technology. Even supermarket bar codes contain a satanic "Mark of 
the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 Corder is careful not to belabor patients about his beliefs unless they know 
him well. Still, just for a lark, he will sometimes test strangers, probing 
their own religious concepts to see if he might find a convert, someone whose 
fascination with the celestial unknown matches his own. 
</P>
<P>
 J. D. Lorenz, a traveling pharmaceutical salesman, discovered this one 
Saturday when he turned up at Corder's office to sell his wares. The two men 
talked drug prices and new products, droning on in a conversation familiar to 
any general practitioner. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, as Lorenz finished his pitch, Dr. Corder's face creased in a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "J. D.," he says, "do you remember what I told you last time about the Mark of 
the Beast? . . ."

VOICES: NO. 1 LEARNS THE RULES; SHANNON HALE FINISHED ATOP LAPD CLASS, BUT SHE 
KNOWS HER EDUCATION HAS JUST BEGUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON HALE, Officer Shannon Hale, 24, graduated first in her class at the 
Los Angeles Police Academy, the first woman to do so. Hale is assigned to the 
Rampart station and has been on the job about six months. She was interviewed 
by Mike Wyma. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My class started out with about 60 people and there were 50 when we were done. 
The department decides who finishes first by taking a cumulative total from 
four areas -- report writing, academics, physical training/self-defense and 
firearms. I was first in PT/self-defense and right up there in everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have helped me that I was the guidon. That's someone they choose 
toward the beginning of the academy to carry the class flag on all the runs. 
Actually, it's the name of the flag and it's also the name of the person who 
carries it. We'd had a few sessions of physical training and somehow they ended 
up choosing me, I think because my drill instructor had the biggest say-so. 
</P>
<P>
 Being guidon was neat, but I put a lot of pressure on myself. My drill 
instructor admitted to me after the whole thing was over that she had tried to 
prove a point about women with me. I'm not sure I made a difference. I happen 
to be female and came out No. 1. Hopefully, that will encourage other women, 
but I just don't know. I feel that a lot of that pressure is off now. I'm just 
trying to learn to be a good patrol officer.  
</P>
<P>
 I just worked my first murder. It happened before I came on watch. We were a 
backup unit. I saw the body and we were there about 4 1/2 hours, guarding one 
of the entrances to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 I've made some arrests and just got my first court subpoena. It's a 
stolen-vehicle case. We were on patrol and observed a car that didn't have any 
plates. It was an older car and there was fresh TC (traffic collision) damage 
on the left taillight. We pulled the vehicle over and ran the car (called for 
identification) and it came back "possibly armed and dangerous." We brought the 
suspects in and the car turned out to be stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't belligerent but they went on and on with their stories. They 
lied. Everybody lies. I don't think I'll ever get over how much people lie to 
you out there. For the first couple weeks I was pretty gullible. I was buying 
everything. I'd say, "Really!" and I was writing it all down and the next thing 
I know they tell me something different. I'd go to my training officer and say, 
"What's the deal?" It's amazing to me how much he knows. It seems to me that he 
knows everything. He knows when they're lying. He knows what the story is. 
We'll be at the scene and I'll be clueless and he'll know the entire story. 
</P>
<P>
 From what I've been told it takes three to five years to become a good police 
officer. I want to make sure I'm competent before I move on to something else. 
If I get promoted, I don't want people looking at me and saying, "Yeah, she got 
promoted because she's a female. She doesn't know what she's doing out there." 
</P>
<P>
 I've thought about having a career plan with the department, but that would be 
like entering first grade and knowing what my major is going to be in college. 
There's so much I don't know right now and there are so many things I'd like to 
do, but there's a lot of learning to do. Hopefully, in a couple of years, I'll 
figure out the direction I want to take. Right now I just want to get the 
basics of patrol down.  
</P>
<P>
 The hours have been kicking my butt. Roll call is 11:15 at night and the watch 
ends at 8 in the morning. I've been sleeping in my closet because it's 
pitch-black. I drag a mattress in there and take my alarm clock. It's messed up 
my eating pattern. I lost a couple pounds and missed some workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always been into fitness. I ran track in high school in Garden Grove and 
at Cal State Long Beach. Prior to going on patrol I worked out as much as I 
could. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm trying to do more weight training for strength because I'm kind of small. 
I'm only 5 feet, 3 inches and about 115 pounds. I've been lifting about five 
days a week and running a few miles. Lifting I enjoy, but I actually don't like 
running. But I feel really good afterward. I just have to get myself up and 
motivated and suck it up through the run. The results are worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 My dad's retired from the California Highway Patrol and I have an uncle who's 
a deputy sheriff in San Diego. And my brother is applying for the LAPD. My dad 
is very supportive. He says if he had it to do over again he'd go for the 
Police Department because there's lots more diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The diversity of police work is what attracted me. No call is ever the same. 
You're moving around. It's exciting. I really don't think it will depress me. 
Maybe make me a little bit cynical but I think that's expected. I try not to 
dwell much on the negative stuff, the sadness. There's the other side. If 
you're arresting someone, you're helping out the victim. You're helping other 
people by getting this person off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 I've thought about Christy Hamilton (slain on-duty in February, shortly after 
graduating from the academy). Her drill instructor was the same as mine. She 
was in the class right before us, and our guidon had her name on it. But I'm 
not afraid, really. During my ride-along we were parked at a corner talking 
tactics and suddenly, maybe 25 yards away, about six rounds went off. It scared 
the crap out of me. We called out an air unit and walked around, searching for 
the suspects. But we didn't find anything. Since then I've been cautious. I'm 
very, very cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 I think at some point I'll be able to tell the difference between the really 
dangerous people and the everyday citizen. But at this point everybody remains 
dangerous.

GAME OF THE WEEK; FRANKLIN RINGS UP WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Franklin Coach Armando Gonzalez's motivation to beat Wilson was to capture 
sole possession of first place in the Northern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conference is the most important thing," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Panther running back Octavio Verduzco had another inspiration: "I'm a senior 
and I didn't want to lose the bell." 
</P>
<P>
 The bell, a symbol of the Franklin-Wilson rivalry that is passed on to the 
annual winner, will remain at Franklin another year thanks to Verduzco's three 
rushing touchdowns in the Panthers' 48-26 win Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Verduzco rushed for 114 yards in 20 carries and scored on six-yard run and 
twice on three-yard runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Panther quarterback Jeff Deno and wideout Johnnie Sanders connected twice on 
scoring passes of 9 and 72 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders finished the game with eight catches for 168 yards.

FIRE AND ICE; FRANKLIN WIDE RECEIVER JOHNNIE SANDERS AND QB JEFF DENO HAVE 
COMBINED TO PLACE THE PANTHERS AMONG THE AREA'S ELITE TEAMS

 Johnnie and Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire and Ice. 
</P>
<P>
 One, Johnnie Sanders, is an emotionally charged wide receiver, whose big-play 
ability lights a spark in the Franklin High football team. 
</P>
<P>
 The other, Jeff Deno, is the composed quarterback, who calmly directs his 
offense downfield like a traffic cop during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Deno and Sanders have blended so well together that they have become the most 
potent quarterback-receiver combination in the Central City while placing 
Franklin among the area's elite teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been our big-play weapon all season," said coach Armando Gonzalez. 
"Our passing attack is our strong suit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers have used the arm of Deno and the hands of Sanders to muscle 
their way into a first-place tie with Wilson atop the Northern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning five of six games, Franklin has averaged 29 points while 
surrendering only 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way Deno and Sanders have been putting up eye-popping statistics. 
Deno is the area's leading passer, completing 89 of 153 attempts for 1,232 
yards and 17 touchdowns going into Friday's game against Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-11, 175-pound southpaw has the ability to conduct the five-minute drive 
as well as strike with the long bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff . . . has that ability to throw the football with precision and 
accuracy," said Gonzalez, who coached the Panthers to a 2-A title in 1983 and 
3-A titles in 1986, '87 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff does well under pressure. His nickname is Ice because he never shows 
much emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, who is 6-4, 198 pounds, has twice scored three touchdowns in a game, 
in wins against North Hollywood and Verdugo Hills. Sanders leads the area in 
receptions (24), yards (521), touchdowns (11) and yards-per-catch (22).  
</P>
<P>
 "That is impressive for playing only four games," said Gonzalez, who suspended 
Sanders for disciplinary reasons, causing him to miss the game against Eagle 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Sanders' assault on the area's record book continues at a 
furious pace. A fact that he credits to Deno. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff is a terrific quarterback with a terrific arm," Sanders said. "He puts 
(the ball) where it is supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Deno is equally enthusiastic about his deep threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnnie is a great asset to the team," Deno said. "So far, he has been the 
receiver I go to." 
</P>
<P>
 Deno and Sanders have another common thread besides football in that they are 
both exceptional two-sport athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Deno is a two-time All-Northern Conference pitcher for the varsity baseball 
team. He was 12-0 as a starter and was the winning pitcher in Franklin's 7-3 
win over defending 3-A champion South Gate in the 1994 City semifinals last 
June. The next week, Deno scored the winning run as the Panthers defeated 
Huntington Park, 3-1, to win the 3-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "That felt great. Hopefully, I can have that feeling again by winning in 
football," Deno said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked which sport he prefers, the senior is quick to answer: "Baseball, 
because I have been playing it all my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Deno played for the Stars traveling team of the Amateur Athletic 
Baseball Congress, which caused him to miss most of football practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez is surprised how quickly Deno has learned the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "He picked up everything during the summer after participating in only one day 
of spring ball. Jeff is doing a phenomenal job to have only played in the 
system for four months," Gonzalez said." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, then, must be astonished at Sanders, who is making his debut on the 
football field after two standout seasons on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get many athletes like Johnnie at Franklin," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, a senior, averaged 20 points his sophomore season and increased it to 
26 points during his junior year. He was chosen for the All-City team and named 
most valuable player of the Northeastern League twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders has used his basketball experience to help make the transition to 
football.  
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball has helped me run better routes in terms of quickness and 
cutting," Sanders said. "I thought football would be a lot harder but I took my 
first hit and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders makes it clear that basketball is the sport he hopes to pursue in 
college, but "I would play both sports if I got the chance. I think I could 
handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their success as a tandem, Deno acknowledges that he and Sanders have 
not been the sole reason for Franklin's fast start. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaching staff helps me a lot and my offensive line is a lot better than 
last year," Deno said. "Everyone on offense and defense has to contribute, but 
as the quarterback I have to take more control once in a while." Sanders 
understands his role is to get open, something he has done virtually at will. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mentality is the same in football as it is in basketball," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can guard me."

 The Lincoln High football team has a new coach this season. And a new look 
thanks to a $250 contribution from the school's alumni association. 
</P>
<P>
 When first-year Coach Joe Silva walked into the equipment room this summer, he 
found 65 orange helmets without team emblems. None had been ordered prior to 
his arrival and no additional funds were available. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers played the first four games of the season with blank helmets. The 
decals, however, were purchased by the alumni association for Lincoln's next 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The decals feature a paw print with Tigers inscribed across it. In previous 
seasons, the team had stickers with Lincoln in block letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln not only dressed well, but played the part in its first game with its 
new logo, defeating Marshall, 22-0, for its first victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alumni association has really helped me out a lot this year," Silva said. 
"I was thinking of striping our helmets like the Cincinnati Bengals, but that 
was too expensive. The new design looked pretty good, though. It's a new era 
and I wanted a different look. Now, if we can only start winning more games."

EAGLES SURVIVE A SCARE; SOCCER: CAL STATE L.A. MANAGES TO WIN ITS FIFTH 
STRAIGHT GAME, 2-1, AGAINST AN UNRANKED CAL POLY POMONA TEAM DESPITE AN 
UNINSPIRED FIRST HALF.

 The Cal State Los Angeles soccer team did not play its best match of the 
season, but it was good enough to defeat Cal Poly Pomona on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dino Torres scored two goals to lift the Golden Eagles to a 2-1 victory in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. match at Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State L.A., seeking its second CCAA title in three years, won its fifth in 
a row to improve to 13-1-1 and 5-1-0 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Eagles trail Cal State Bakersfield (9-2-3, 5-0-1) in the battle for 
first place with four conference games remaining. The teams played Saturday in 
Bakersfield and will meet in the regular-season finale Nov. 5 at Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pomona always gives us a difficult time," Torres said. "We didn't play very 
well. We've played better at other times of the season. But what matters is we 
got the victory. We came out lackadaisical and thought we were going to run 
over this team." 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much reason for the junior forward to believe otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Eagles, ranked seventh in NCAA Division II, were pitted against an 
unranked Cal Poly Pomona team with a record of 1-13-1 and 0-6-1 after 
Wednesday's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 There was another good omen for the Golden Eagles when Torres scored off a 
throw to give Cal State L.A. a 1-0 lead five minutes into the match. Cal State 
L.A. is 11-0 this season when the Golden Eagles score first. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the Golden Eagles, it was their only shot on goal in the first half. 
Pomona's Roger Wirz scored on a rebound in the 23rd minute to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pomona is not a bad team and has what it takes to come out with a victory," 
said Cal State L.A. goalkeeper Claine Plummer, who had two saves.  
</P>
<P>
 Cal State L.A. regained the lead, 2-1, five minutes into the second half. 
Torres knocked in a pass from Dario Gomez from seven yards out for his ninth 
goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Eagle defense took over from there, limiting the Broncos to one 
shot on goal in the second half. Cal State L.A. outshot Pomona, 9-8, in the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to take one game at a time," Torres said. "Now we can look ahead to 
Bakersfield. This is a team with character and we manage to pull things out and 
win when we need to."

THE THEOLOGIAN OF TALK; THE QUESTION IS WHETHER JUSTICE EXISTS AND REASON CAN 
BENEFIT SOCIETY. IT'S POSTMODERN TO SAY NO, BUT JURGEN HABERMAS, A GERMAN 
PHILOSOPHER, DISAGREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mitchell Stephens, Mitchell Stephens, who has also profiled Jacques Derrida 
for the magazine, heads the journalism and mass communication program at New 
York University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A debate has been raging in the world of scholars and intellectuals. On one 
side are the "postmodernists" -- the thinkers whose ideas inspired the playful, 
hybrid buildings, outfits and artworks that now grace the American landscape; 
the thinkers who encouraged a generation of graduate students to "deconstruct" 
such long-treasured notions as "reason" and "justice." 
</P>
<P>
 The major figure on the other side of this debate is Jurgen Habermas. 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas is a German philosopher -- "the leading systematic philosopher of our 
time," Richard Rorty of the University of Virginia calls him. But Habermas 
comes to this debate as much more than just a philosopher. "In terms of range 
and depth there is no one close to him," says Thomas McCarthy, a professor of 
humanities and philosophy at Northwestern University. "Habermas has been able 
to go into discussions in political theory, in sociology, in psychology, in 
legal theory -- in a dozen different disciplines -- and become one of the 
dominant voices in each one." 
</P>
<P>
 In the academic world nowadays, such range, depth and dominance attract an 
endless stream of conference invitations. Habermas accepts his share. And 
sometimes at these conferences, particularly if Americans are in attendance, 
he'll find himself surrounded by postmodernists. Swords will be raised. The 
debate will resume. The postmodernists might begin questioning, for example, 
whether "reason" isn't just the name the powerful give to their rationales for 
holding power or whether "justice" isn't just an excuse for the majority to 
impose its morality on the minority. (One such conference was dominated by 
legal theorists from Harvard Law School.) Habermas, an aficionado of open 
debate, will fight back, enthusiastically, aggressively.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether he has been a voice of reason and justice is disputed in philosophic 
and political circles, but Habermas certainly has been a staunch advocate of 
the importance of these principles. He believes we can reason out solutions to 
our problems, that just institutions can lead to a fairer society. And when 
irony-wielding postmodernists make light of these possibilities, Habermas 
responds with formidable barrages of scholarship and logic. 
</P>
<P>
 This is high drama, or at least what passes for that in academia. Feet wiggle 
nervously under chairs. In the audience, students and professors furrow their 
high brows and jot down each deft riposte. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake in these confrontations is a crucial 20th-Century intellectual issue: 
Are there certain basic standards underlying our behaviors -- standards like 
reason and justice? Or is the world a swampy, relativistic place, where we play 
our games or seek some power in the muck? For Habermas, something else is at 
stake here, too: A crucial 20th-Century political issue.  
</P>
<P>
 According to a number of those who have watched him at such conferences, 
Habermas sometimes grows exasperated with his cynical antagonists. When that 
happens, he might pull a microphone toward himself and suddenly silence the 
others on the panel by saying something like this: "In the United States, you 
have a 200-year-old tradition of constitutionalism. You have the luxury of 
questioning those ideals. Where I come from, we don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Where he comes from, Habermas is not just a star academic. For 40 years, he 
has been in the public arena fighting to keep Germany headed in the direction 
of reason, justice and other ideals he now hears postmodernists deconstructing. 
And that fight -- a political fight -- goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurgen Habermas, as often happens when he reads the newspaper, was agitated. 
It was 1992, and right-wing attacks on immigrants and foreign workers, which 
had begun in the former East Germany, were continuing. "Every week there were 
reports about another three or four incidents," Habermas recalls at his home 
outside Munich. "And as you read the paper every morning, you could not help 
but get more and more angry -- not just at those who did it, but at those who 
played it down, who turned their backs, who worried that talking about it would 
hurt Germany's image in the world. And then, when a certain threshold was 
passed, you couldn't help but write an article." 
</P>
<P>
 When Habermas writes such an article for a German newspaper, as he does three 
or four times a year, it usually causes a stir. "He's a public figure," 
explains Peter Glotz, a leader of Germany's Social Democratic Party. "His 
writings don't influence masses of blue-collar workers, but they are read by a 
lot of German party officials and journalists and so on. In this way he is very 
influential." 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas is, in other words, that rare thing: a public intellectual -- "the 
most visible of his generation," asserts Northwestern's McCarthy. Certainly, no 
contemporary American scholar has had such impact upon political debates. And 
Habermas' political significance would be even greater were it not for an odd 
quirk: He is one of the few public figures today who refuses to go on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 A cleft palate gives a slightly asymmetric feel to Habermas' square, strong 
face and has left him with a minor speech impediment. Might this be behind his 
reluctance to appear before the cameras? "The pragmatic reason why I refuse 
these requests is that I have to protect the time and rest (I need) for my 
professional work," he notes. Then Habermas adds, "Maybe there are also reasons 
of a more personal nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Print is Habermas' medium: Books, of course, and he reads and writes a wide 
variety of them, including many difficult philosophic tomes. But not just 
books. "I need to read a newspaper each morning to feel that I'm still 
participating in the world," the philosopher declares. "Reading the newspaper 
arouses passions." Those passions grow most intense when he sees evidence that 
Germany is backsliding. 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas was 15 when the Allies defeated Germany in 1945. He had been a member 
of the Hitler Youth and had been sent, during the last months of the war, to 
"man the western defenses." His bourgeois father had been a "passive 
sympathizer" with Nazism. Nazi society was the only one the young Habermas had 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Nuremberg war-crimes trials started, and the first documentary films 
on the concentration camps appeared. "All at once we saw that we had been 
living in a politically criminal system," Habermas has explained. His political 
life began with this awakening. It established what he labels the major "motif" 
of his politics: a vigilance against any recurrence of such "politically 
criminal" behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 This "motif" was in harmony with the beliefs of the "Frankfurt School," an 
extraordinarily distinguished collection of leftist, mostly Jewish, 
philosophers and social thinkers gathered in the Institute of Social Research 
at the University of Frankfurt. After the war, when most of its members 
returned from exile, the institute was led by two of the world's foremost 
intellectuals, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer. 
</P>
<P>
 The aggressively interdisciplinary way of thinking that the Frankfurt School 
developed -- "Critical Theory" it was called -- aimed to put philosophic ideas 
to the task of diagnosing social problems. There were years when it was 
difficult to get through college in Europe without being drawn into debates 
about the success of this project. Habermas became Adorno's assistant in 1956. 
He was given Horkheimer's chair in 1964. Habermas quickly found his own voice 
as a theorist, but he has never stopped trying to apply philosophic ideas to 
social problems. Indeed, he has had as much to say about the perils of 
intolerance, repression and poverty as any other modern philosopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas subsequently became a political figure -- and a target. Student 
radicals attacked him in 1968 for being insufficiently sympathetic with their 
tactics. The right derided him and the other members of the Frankfurt School in 
the 1970s as the "spiritual fathers of the terrorists." Habermas had denounced 
these young German kidnapers and bombers, but, his critics noted, many of them 
had read his calls for a more free and equal society. 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas continues to get into squabbles -- with those who sped Germany toward 
reunification (too quickly, in his view); with those who want to take apart his 
country's ambitious system of social welfare, and with those he believes to be 
opponents of open debate or proponents of intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, his most visible fight has been with German revisionist 
historians, who attempted, in his words, "to make Auschwitz unexceptional" by 
connecting it to other 20th-Century massacres. Habermas labeled their arguments 
"astonishing" and "transparent" as he took them on one by one in a series of 
newspaper articles. Along the way he reminded his readers of "the obligation 
incumbent upon us in Germany -- even if no one else were to feel it any longer 
-- to keep alive, without distortion and not only in an intellectual form, the 
memory of the sufferings of those who were murdered by German hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Semitism is a subject on which Habermas has been particularly vigilant. 
"I've never met a non-Jew who is more sensitive to these issues -- 
intellectually and personally," says his friend Richard J. Bernstein, a 
philosophy professor at the New School in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The word conscience is used frequently, at least by those on the left half of 
the political spectrum, in describing Habermas' role in German politics. "He 
will always stand up and say the right thing at the right moment," asserts 
Anselm Haverkamp, a literature professor from Germany who now directs the 
Poetics Institute at New York University. "And he says it without the 
politicians saying, 'Well, this is just an idealistic philosopher.' No one 
would say that about Habermas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas' political ideas, he is happy to acknowledge, are connected to his 
philosophy. But when he is asked to sum up that philosophy, he grows quiet for 
some minutes. "I must say that I hate that question," he finally responds, a 
smile lifting the corners of his wispy mustache. "I hate this idea that you 
have one great idea, as (the German philosopher Martin) Heidegger always 
maintained you should." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Habermas has had a large number of good ideas as he has sailed from 
one research area to another. But behind his contributions to all these 
different disciplines there seems to have been one central theme: his theory of 
"communicative action." 
</P>
<P>
 As Seyla Benhabib, a professor of political theory at Harvard, explains: 
"Habermas believes human social life rests on our capacity to have more or less 
clear communication with each other." We communicate -- to paraphrase Descartes 
-- therefore our society exists. 
</P>
<P>
 A rather antiquated, idealistic message to be spreading, some might think, in 
a world of abusive talk-show hosts, misogynistic rap groups and 
earphone-encased teen-agers. Habermas is, to be sure, as concerned about pop 
culture as the next philosopher. But he continues to believe that somewhere 
behind the better of our attempts to communicate with each other, there have to 
be some shared values, shared respect and acknowledged equality. He sees the 
participants in conversations, in other words, as playing on the same teams. 
And as they talk together, Habermas insists, they make an effort to employ 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may not seem like a big deal," Benhabib acknowledges. "But it has 
fundamentally changed our way of thinking about society in the last 25 years or 
so." Habermas' theory, she explains, calls into question a belief that is 
widely held by cynical and fashionable thinkers on the right and the left: the 
belief that human behavior should be seen as a battlefield upon which each of 
us is merely out for our own strategic interests. In our "communicative 
actions," the right sees selfish individuals struggling to get a leg up on each 
other; the postmodern left sees the powerful exploiting the powerless; but 
Habermas sees, of all things, a kind of cooperation. Indeed, he shares with 
Socrates an almost utopian belief in the wholesomeness of debate and 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 His critics find this view a trifle rosy. Habermas persists, for example, in 
maintaining that "in our everyday knowledge of how language is properly used we 
find a common ground among all creatures with a human face." That's called 
"humanism." That's called "universalism." These are beliefs any self-respecting 
postmodernist rejected decades ago. Moreover, Habermas is convinced -- and this 
really gets the postmodernists calling for the violins -- that through reasoned 
communication we humans can get beyond our biases. 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas' many acolytes share this faith. They have been pondering the glories 
of the impulse to communicate in philosophy and exploring the roots of that 
impulse in developmental psychology. They have been refashioning political 
theory and social theory -- to make room for more debate and discussion. And, 
fashionable or not, they have had considerable impact. "Habermas is a world 
figure, maybe a planetary figure, in social theory," states sociologist Herbert 
J. Gans of Columbia University.

 Habermas' formulations have even made their way into a debate about the U.S. 
Constitution. The question, as it always is, is should the Constitution referee 
in tag-team matches between hostile and competing interest groups? Or should 
this document, and the government it laid out, serving as a facilitator, 
encourage chummy, reasonable citizens to exchange views and reach a consensus? 
"Habermas' work has been of use for those of us who are trying to make sense 
out of the latter view," says Frank Michelman, a professor at Harvard Law 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Habermas bristled at the presumption that he has had "one great 
idea," the philosopher is willing, after some meditation, to admit to the 
existence of a "thread" that runs through his work. This is it: "I think that a 
certain form of unrestrained communication brings to the fore the deepest force 
of reason, which enables us to overcome egocentric or ethnocentric perspectives 
and reach an expanded . . . view." 
</P>
<P>
 This thread ties in neatly with the values of the Enlightenment. Those of us 
who have been out of social studies class for a while may need to be reminded 
that the Enlightenment was a struggle, which began 200 years ago, in the name 
of reason, against tyranny, superstition and inequity. Voltaire and Thomas 
Jefferson saw themselves as involved in that struggle. Habermas has contributed 
to it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Enlightenment, you see, left open a crucial question: How does reason -- 
at whose behest so much has been challenged -- justify itself? Reason has 
undercut our belief in the spiritual, in the traditional. What is to prevent 
reason from challenging reason? Why, in other words, should we believe in 
reason? In "communicative action," Habermas thinks he has come up with an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Reason, he maintains, is crucial to clear communication. So, to oversimplify a 
little, if we believe in the importance of the universal human impulse to 
communicate, we have to believe in reason. The Enlightenment, Habermas 
concludes, continues to have "a sound core." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those looking for a 20th-Century movement in which to pigeonhole Habermas 
often settle upon "modernism." His sympathy with the travails of reason and his 
fascination with the Enlightenment support that classification. So does his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 It stands, rectangular and devoid of decorative flourishes, on a narrow, 
sharply sloping lot in Starnberg, a small lakeside town outside Munich. 
Habermas left Frankfurt for Starnberg in 1971 to become co-director of the Max 
Planck Institute for Research Into Conditions of Living in a Scientific and 
Technological World. He and his wife, Ute, then built a spectacular, 
pure-white, Bauhaus-style house, filled with books and light. They were 
inspired by the great Viennese architect Albert Loos -- the quintessential 
modernist. 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas returned to the University of Frankfurt 12 years later, but between 
academic sessions, he and Ute, with whom he has reared three children, continue 
to spend most of their time in Starnberg. "There's no great reason for them to 
return there," suggests one colleague. "I think they stay there because of that 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, philosophical fashions, like architectural fashions, have changed 
in the last decades of this century. The Enlightenment, many contemporary 
scholars maintain, is over, modernism finished. "Habermas is the leading 
defender of Enlightenment universalism," comments Rorty, probably the 
best-known American philosopher. "I find his attempt very impressive. He does 
it in a way nobody had thought of doing before, but I still don't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the postmodern age, of course, humans aren't seen as having universal 
impulses or sharing a common ground. Postmodernists have no use for such 
generalizations. Human attitudes, they insist, vary as much as human cultures 
do. Japanese see things differently than Swedes. Metallica lovers probably see 
things differently than those who fancy Counting Crows. The world, 
postmodernists maintain, is full of egocentric and ethnocentric biases, full of 
complexities. Attempts to squeeze it into smooth, rectangular packages -- in 
philosophy or in architecture -- are futile and foolish. In the postmodern age, 
those who create buildings, clothing, novels and world views are encouraged to 
throw in a little of this and a little of that -- without pretending that this 
or that, one perspective or another, is somehow correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Reason is the tool we use to divine what is correct and construct those 
out-of-favor generalizations, so in the postmodern age it is particularly 
suspect. The late French philosopher Michel Foucault derided reason as just 
another instrument of oppression, just another weapon on the battlefield. 
Another French philosopher, Jean-Francois Lyotard, who teaches at UC Irvine, 
has argued that the "triumph of reason," which we tend to credit for science or 
democracy or MacNeil-Lehrer, is merely a "narrative" we tell ourselves -- a 
bedtime story for those of us who haven't outgrown the belief in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the finish of this century," contends Lyotard, author of the book "The 
Postmodern Condition," "after the enormous massacres we have experienced, no 
one can any longer believe in progress, in consensus, in transcendent values. 
Habermas presupposes such a belief." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Fish, a professor of English and law at Duke University, has been 
particularly critical of Habermas' work. Fish scoffs at the notion that we 
might talk our way past our biases. In order to enter into a conversation in 
which you might lose your prejudices, he argues, you'd have to begin by putting 
aside your prejudices. "The trouble with Habermas' way of thinking," Fish 
asserts, "is that you couldn't possibly take this first step. This first step 
is in fact the last step. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always been mystified by the attention that Habermas receives," Fish 
says. "His way of thinking about these matters seems to me to be obviously 
faulty. The only way I can explain it to myself is that Habermas represents 
something that a lot of people would like to buy into: He seems to offer a way 
out of corrosive relativism."  
</P>
<P>
 If Habermas' thoughts provide some resistance to the potentially "corrosive" 
belief that such standards as justice and reason are merely "relative," his 
ideas do not come from some sort of stainless idealism. His beloved reason is 
not a magic sword that can instantly slice away all biases. It is, instead, a 
late-20th-Century reason; that means he sees it as fallible, as merely the 
product of imperfect human discussion and debate. Habermas doesn't pretend that 
prejudices can be instantly removed or discarded. He does believe, despite what 
the postmodernists say, that reasoned communication can, over time, weaken 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 So the battle lines have been drawn. Habermas, says Martin Jay, a history 
professor at UC Berkeley, is "a bulwark against some of the more problematic 
strains in postmodern thought." Habermas' book "The Philosophical Discourse of 
Modernity" defends modernism against the prefix that presumes to outdate it and 
criticizes various postmodern demigods -- including Foucault and Mr. 
Deconstruction, Jacques Derrida. Rather than going beyond modernism, he argues, 
some of them have just wandered off on some of its more "negative" and "empty" 
byways. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough criticism. Before Foucault died, he and Habermas had established a 
friendship and a dialogue. Habermas had thought he was on his way to building a 
similar relationship with Derrida. Then he sent him a copy of this book. 
Habermas received a polite thank-you note and then never heard from Derrida 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas' unfashionable beliefs, particularly his attachment to reason, 
probably can be traced to a deep awareness -- where he comes from -- of the 
horrors of unreason. "When you begin flirting with irrationalism and nihilism," 
explains his friend Bernstein, "for him it evokes horrible memories. It evokes 
the Hitler period." 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas admits that there is a strong personal element in his thought. 
"Philosophers live finally from their own intuitions," he suggests. "And those 
intuitions are not acquired by reading philosophic texts. They are acquired in 
certain particular individual experiences while growing up -- rather negative 
experiences of violation, indignation and Kra nkung. " Habermas' English is 
strong. He has taught at Berkeley, for example, and he is teaching at 
Northwestern University in Chicago this fall. However, Habermas can't think of 
an English translation for this German word. 
</P>
<P>
 What early experiences might have shaped the philosophy of this man, who grew 
up sensitive, brainy and with a slight impediment in Nazi Germany? "I wouldn't 
like to talk about my own intuitions," Habermas says. "I don't like to talk 
about that." Krankung , a dictionary later reveals, means "insult," "outrage" 
or "mortification." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anselm Haverkamp recalls having spent the whole day with Habermas at a 
conference in Germany. "It was a typical European conference," the New York 
University professor says. "It began at 9 in the morning and went on for eight 
or 10 hours." Then there was more talking over dinner. At 2 a.m. Haverkamp, 
exhausted but jet-lagged and unable to sleep, went downstairs. "And there was 
Habermas, still talking to a couple of people at the hotel bar. He grabbed my 
arm and wouldn't let me pass, and for yet another two hours we continued to 
discuss difficult problems in political philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas, in other words, not only believes in reasoned communication, he 
practices it -- eagerly. Not on every subject, of course. Pockets of reticence 
certainly remain. (Habermas has admitted that he failed to confront his father 
about his behavior during the Nazi years.) But, for the most part, he throws 
himself into debate and discussion with passion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Habermas is someone who really has to be pulled out of a restaurant at 
midnight," says Gertrud Koch, a German scholar and film critic who has spent 
many evenings with him and a group of professors and students at a Greek 
restaurant in Frankfurt. And the later the hour grows, "the more the discussion 
turns to politics, and the more lively it gets," reports Hauke Brunkhorst, a 
philosophy professor who has participated in these sessions. Even the waiters 
and the restaurant's owner sometimes join in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," Habermas admits, "I love it." His wife, he says, often has to 
remind him that he is teaching the next morning and not to stay too late. 
</P>
<P>
 When the discussion does turn to politics, Brunkhorst explains, Habermas 
stands, "in American terms, somewhere between a radical and a liberal." He 
votes mostly for Germany's Social Democrats and is sympathetic to the Greens, 
the environmental party. He supports, what he calls without flinching, the 
"welfare state," which has come under renewed attack in Germany and elsewhere 
in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The key word in Habermas' political vocabulary, however, is democracy. He 
often has in mind a more "radical democracy" than that with which most 
Americans are familiar. "In the phrase 'government by and for the people,' 
Habermas places much more emphasis on the 'by' than most of us normally would," 
McCarthy explains. He wants less unthinking nationalism and more reasoned 
communication on public issues. He wants more participation by citizens in 
government processes, in political parties, in economic decisions -- a larger 
"public sphere" than can be found in any existing society. He wants more debate 
and discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 This prescription, too, sounds naive to many allies of the postmodernist camp. 
"It's the liberal answer to everything," asserts Fish. "Let's talk it to death. 
Habermas preaches the theology of talk -- the elevation of philosophy 
department seminars to a mode of public life." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives find Habermas' political ideas disturbing for different reasons. 
"His work is stimulating, intellectually challenging," concedes Wolfgang 
Pordzik, director of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Washington, D.C., which 
is close to Germany's Christian Democratic Party. "But Habermas is just dead 
wrong in terms of his political recipe." In the eyes of most of those on the 
other side of the political spectrum, that "recipe" includes too much "public" 
-- which they read as "state" -- interference in economic matters. It places 
too much emphasis on cooperation, not enough on old-fashioned, reliable 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Habermas' strategies for increasing the scope and power of the 
"public sphere" have had a significant impact. Indeed, they were important to 
those who were fighting state communism in Eastern Europe before 1989. "In 
Eastern Europe, the Communists had crushed all public spaces," notes Jean L. 
Cohen, a political science professor at Columbia University. Habermas 
demonstrated how important forums for public discussion outside of government 
were, and his theories helped dissidents imagine how these forums might be used 
-- as the Solidarity labor movement was used -- to oppose the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Michnik, one of the leaders of Solidarity in Poland, had studied 
Habermas' work while in jail. A large number of Hungarian dissidents were also 
familiar with it. "Habermas' book 'The Structural Transformation of the Public 
Sphere' played an extremely important political role in Hungary," explains Anna 
Wessely, a professor of sociology at the Eotvos University in Budapest. "It 
helped to conceptualize the role of the society against the state." 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one Eastern European country, Habermas' impact is spoken of in the 
present tense. Ivan Vejvoda is one of several members of the Belgrade Circle, a 
group of anti-war Serbian intellectuals, who say they have been influenced by 
Habermas' work. "One of the main concerns of the Belgrade Circle," Vejvoda 
says, "is to try to broaden the scope of free speech, to create a public space 
out of which we can create the foundation of a democratic culture. Habermas' 
ideas are absolutely not only useful but important in this process." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opposite the bookcases in the living room of Habermas' modern house is a wall 
of windows. It faces west, which is fitting. Over the years, Habermas has had 
one overriding political interest: not Eastern Europe, despite all the 
attention his work has received there, but the Federal Republic of Germany. 
And, over the years, Habermas has given himself to one overriding cause: 
keeping the Federal Republic oriented toward Enlightenment values, values that 
have been most at home in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear to him that the fall of the Berlin Wall, glorious as it was, 
has helped that cause. Though Habermas is obviously happy for the former East 
Germans, the new, reunited Germany makes him nervous. "From the first minute, I 
argued that we should stress republican premises for reunification, not 
nationalistic premises," he notes. As Bernstein points out, "Any smell of 
Germany having a special destiny almost viscerally upsets him." 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas wanted the East Germans to have more time to discuss their own 
future. Now he worries about the resentment against immigrants that has been 
released by the dislocations of reunification. He worries, too, that this 
larger, potentially more powerful Germany will stray from the confines of the 
European Union, form separate relationships with its former communist neighbors 
and assume, once again, the role of leader of Central Europe. He worries, in 
other words, that the country in which he lives, which so conspicuously lacks a 
long tradition of constitutionalism, might now turn away from the West. Indeed, 
Habermas has worried so much, so publicly, that he has been attacked -- 
unfairly he says -- as a foe of reunification. 
</P>
<P>
 The winds shifted in Europe just when Habermas felt that his great cause was 
going well. "For almost 40 years," he explains, "I struggled against what I 
thought was the dangerous tendency toward . . . continuations of those 
anti-Western traditions that prepared the German population for a rather strong 
support of the Nazis after 1933." But this nightmare did not come true. In the 
Federal Republic, Enlightenment values seem to have, for the most part, won 
out. (Habermas believes these values are in some ways now more at home in 
Germany than in France or America, whose phalanxes of postmodernists delight in 
deconstructing them.) 
</P>
<P>
 "During the postwar period, particularly since the late '60s, the Federal 
Republic got more and more politically civilized," Habermas observes. "And now 
I'm defending a continuation of this process rather than hailing the break of 
1989." 
</P>
<P>
 The Western democracies still have great social and political problems. The 
danger that the Germany of his childhood might return can never entirely be 
dismissed. Habermas, undoubtedly, will have no difficulty getting sufficiently 
agitated to write more newspaper articles. However, an additional benefit of 
remembering the past is gaining perspective on the present. And from the living 
room of his modern house in the heart of Bavaria, which is flooded by light 
from the west, Habermas sees reason, if not having triumphed, at least having 
made great progress. "Why stop?" he asks. "Why not continue?"

 Adrian Anderson's interception set up Crenshaw's third and deciding touchdown 
as the Cougars beat two-time defending City Section 3-A champion San Pedro, 
22-14, Friday in a Southern Pacific Conference game at Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a junior linebacker, picked off a pass from quarterback Melvin 
Yarbrough and ran 40 yards to the Pirates' three-yard line. After being 
penalized twice for illegal procedure, Crenshaw scored on a 13-yard pass from 
quarterback Ricky Lumford to Kabeer Smith. Anderson, who also plays fullback, 
ran in the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big-time play," Crenshaw Coach Robert Garrett said about Anderson's 
interception. "It was Division I. Prime time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars' other two scores came on Lumford's 50-yard pass play to Drake 
Beasley and Farrel Payton's six-yard run. Payton had 63 yards in 16 carries.

 Alhambra 45, Bell Gardens 38--Eddie Negrete of Bell Gardens High set a school 
passing record, completing 16 of 31 passes for 309 yards, but a second-half 
rally fell short in an Almont League game that featured a one-man show by 
Alhambra's Aryn Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams combined for 810 yards offense--432 by Alhambra--who got 27 points 
from Hart on three rushing touchdowns, a field goal and six extra points. Hart 
also threw three touchdown passes. Trailing, 45-31, Negrete, who surpassed the 
record of 297 yards set by Robert Perez in 1982, connected with Ricardo Flores 
on a 30-yard touchdown pass with 4:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers stopped the Moors on downs and took over at their 27 with 2:07 to 
play. Bell Gardens drove to the Alhambra 41 before surrendering the ball on 
downs with a minute left.  
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens had rallied from a 13-0 first-half deficit to tie the score, 
31-31, on a two-yard run by David Villegas at the start of the fourth quarter.

THE WORLD; THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR DEAL: MISTRUST -- AND VERIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four months ago, North Korea's nuclear ambitions set the country on a direct 
course for confrontation with the United States. Today, if all goes according 
to plan, the accord reached last week between Washington and Pyongyang may well 
be a breakthrough that, as President Bill Clinton said, will help achieve "an 
end to the threat of nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula." But the 
roller-coaster history of dealings with Pyongyang, coupled with its reluctance 
to pursue reconciliation with South Korea, suggest another possibility: Charlie 
Brown (the United States), again persuaded by Lucy (North Korea) that she will 
hold the football upright so he may kick off, learns yet again that Lucy is all 
too eager to pull the football away at the last second. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord, fleshed out with a secret side note, is a framework of phased-in 
steps for freezing and eventually rolling back North Korea's nuclear-weapons 
program. It also contains a package of economic, political and security 
benefits that the United States and its allies would give North Korea in 
exchange for ending its quest to build bombs. As with most such agreements, 
however, the devil is in the details, and some of them are disconcertingly 
vague. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the United States would arrange for an international consortium, 
largely paid for by South Korea and Japan, to replace North Korea's 
plutonium-producing graphite reactors with more proliferation-resistant 
light-water reactors, at a cost of about $4 billion. In addition, Washington 
would take the lead in meeting North Korea's oil needs during the 6- to 10-year 
interval required to install the new reactors; lift its trade embargo against 
Pyongyang; open a liaison office in the North Korean capital as a first step 
toward full diplomatic relations, and provide assurances against the threat or 
use of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, North Korea would agree to a verifiable freeze, monitored by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, and fulfill its Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty commitments. It would not restart its 5-megawatt reactor, from which it 
pulled fuel rods last May. (The rods, which, if reprocessed, could produce 
several bombs worth of plutonium, sit in cooling ponds under the IAEA's gaze.) 
It would seal and no longer operate its reprocessing facility, where it 
actually manufactures plutonium. Finally, Pyongyang will stop construction on 
50- and 200-megawatt graphite reactors, which, if completed, could produce 
enough plutonium to make a dozen bombs a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the devil: What about North Korea's nuclear past? The train of events 
producing the nuclear crisis began in late 1992, when an IAEA lab analysis 
revealed that North Korea had done more reprocessing -- hence, acquired more 
plutonium -- than it had declared. U.S. intelligence agencies had reportedly 
provided satellite photos of two hidden nuclear-waste sites, where reprocessing 
could take place. It was the agency's demand to enter these sites that moved 
North Korea to threaten withdrawal from the non-proliferation regime. 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's agreement, Pyongyang promised to allow the IAEA to do whatever 
is necessary to uncover the true history of its weapons program -- but not for 
another five years or more. Similarly, the near-term fate of the fuel rods 
remains clouded. It is this large gap in implementation that has spawned some 
legitimate criticism of, and some partisan sniping at, the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 There is certainly some cause for concern. But despite its flaws, the 
agreement, on balance, is defensible. It offers a step-by-step program for 
building good faith that, if implemented, would result in a major achievement 
-- turning off and ultimately dismantling North Korea's weapons program before 
it attains the capability to produce dozens of nuclear devices. In fact, by 
mothballing its reprocessing facility, which is permitted under the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the agreement is more stringent than IAEA norms. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, it is irritating that North Korea, caught lying and cheating, is 
now being rewarded. But the non-proliferation system is a discriminatory and 
imperfect one. And while the North Korean case may encourage potential bomb 
builders like Iran to play a similar game, the circumstances on the heavily 
armed Korean Peninsula are so dangerous and unique that bending the rules there 
may not prove as costly as some fear. After all, although the IAEA has the 
legal authority to conduct special inspections, it is not standard procedure. 
Indeed, apart from Iraq, which lost a war, it has never really done so. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a still larger problem. For the accord to work, North Korea must 
fulfill a set of agreements it signed in December, 1991, with South Korea. The 
nuclear issue is part of the larger question of Korean reunification. Outspoken 
criticism of the United States by South Korean President Kim Young Sam reflects 
his anxiety that Pyongyang is trying to drive a wedge between Washington and 
Seoul to manipulate North-South relations. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are some hopeful signs. The new regime in Pyongyang appears to view 
the nuclear agreement with the United States as a means to bolster its 
political legitimacy following the death of Kim Il Sung. After loudly rejecting 
a light-water reactor from South Korea, the North now appears to accept the 
reality that Seoul must be involved. And Seoul, meantime, has retreated 
somewhat from its skepticism and welcomed the nuclear accord, and even started 
to talk about more economic cooperation with the North. 
</P>
<P>
 New political minefields sown by North Korea no doubt lie ahead. The 
Administration should thus adhere to a strict interpretation of the agreement 
and maintain a vigilant "mistrust but verify" attitude. But given the 
alternatives, the accord is worth pursuing, and if implemented, an important 
step forward for nuclear non-proliferation.*

THE NATION; AFTER A FURIOUS BATTLE FOR CONTROL, CENTRISTS WIN OUT ON HIGH COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David M. O'Brien, David M. O'Brien is a professor at the University of 
Virginia and author of Storm Center: The Supreme Court in American Politics 
(Norton) and an annual Supreme Court Watch (Norton), among other books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rehnquist court has been taking fewer and fewer cases each year. Is the 
U.S. Supreme Court retreating from the political landscape? Not likely. Is this 
the court's way of halting what it perceives as past "judicial activism"? 
Probably, not. A far more likely explanation is that the court's centrists are 
in control and have no truck with the arch-conservatives' agenda of overturning 
liberal precedents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and his far-right 
colleagues, Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, appear content to 
avoid possible future rulings that go against what they stand for. They are 
engaged in damage control against the growing core of more moderate centrists 
who oppose overruling liberal precedents and settled law. 
</P>
<P>
 Last term, the court handed down written opinions in just 93 cases out of more 
than 7,700 cases on its docket. That is the lowest number since the 1955 term, 
when the Warren court decided 94 cases by written opinion out of a far smaller 
docket of 1,856. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, in the 1970s and '80s, the Burger court (1969-86) regularly 
disposed of more than 150 cases by written opinions each year. Most justices 
complained they were deciding too many cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The court has certainly solved its workload problem -- if it had one. With 
Rehnquist at the helm, conferences are more tightly run and the justices have 
become more selective in granting review. In addition, Congress, in 1988, gave 
the Supreme Court virtually complete discretion to decide what to decide. The 
court no longer has to review certain appeals. The court, as Justice Sandra Day 
O'Connor often stresses, decides only "hard cases" -- those raising the most 
divisive conflicts of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices also generally grant review of cases in which a majority wants to 
reverse a ruling of a lower federal court or state court. Some court watchers 
speculate that, after 12 years of appointees to the federal judiciary by 
Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the Rehnquist court is 
content to leave many conservative appellate-court decisions alone. But there 
is more to the court's taking fewer cases than that. 
</P>
<P>
 A kind of epic struggle took place within the court and its far-right wing 
lost out. The most notable battle was over abortion. In Webster vs. 
Reproductive Health Services (1989), the court split five-to-four. A bare 
majority refused to overrule the 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade on a woman's right 
to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania vs. 
Casey, the court's centrists, Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and 
O'Connor, again prevailed. They, with Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul 
Stevens, reaffirmed "the essence" of Roe. Rehnquist and Scalia, joined by 
Thomas and Byron R. White, again bitterly lamented the failure to overturn Roe. 
The right wing of the Rehnquist court has been fighting a rear-guard action 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first years of the Rehnquist court, to be sure, it lunged in more 
conservative directions. The justices also rushed to overrule liberal 
precedents. In its first four terms, no fewer than 11 precedents were 
abandoned. In the 1990 term alone, five more were discarded. Another seven were 
jettisoned next term, for a total of 23. But that was the high-water mark. None 
has been reversed in the last two terms. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the conservative slide and hasty press to overrule liberal 
precedents has been abated, due to the growing influence of centrists and to 
changes in the composition of the bench. Reagan's elevation of Rehnquist to 
chief justice and the appointments of Scalia, in 1986, and Kennedy, in 1987, 
moved the court right. But Bush's two appointees were a mixed bag for 
conservatives. Thomas has proved to be a consistent ally of Rehnquist and 
Scalia. Souter, however, has come into his own since his appointment in 1990. 
He has demonstrated leadership and taken Rehnquist and Scalia to task for some 
of their views and insistence on overruling liberal precedents. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic President Bill Clinton's appointment of two more centrists, 
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg last year and Stephen G. Breyer this year, has 
further solidified the centrists' control. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehnquist and his two principal allies have lost the war over more than just 
abortion. Their defense of states rights and attempts to limit congressional 
power have also been rejected by the court's majority. Their efforts to allow 
greater regulation of commercial speech and to permit greater governmental 
accommodation of religion in public schools have also been rebuffed by the 
court's centrists. 
</P>
<P>
 As chief justice, Rehnquist has proved an efficient administrator, but his 
judicial philosophy and devotion to undoing past liberal decisions has been 
unpersuasive. Admittedly, he does not go out of his way to try to make converts 
or to put heavy-handed pressure on the others. By contrast, Scalia overplays 
his hand. His temperament is too much that of an academic. His acerbic wit and 
penchant for haranguing those who disagree have backfired. On more than one 
occasion, it has cost him, and the far right, the votes of O'Connor, Kennedy 
and Souter. 
</P>
<P>
 With his keen sense of humor and considerable charm, Scalia had the potential 
of becoming the Justice William J. Brennan Jr. of the right. Brennan was a 
master at forging opinions that commanded majorities. Instead, Scalia has 
proved more like Justice Felix Frankfurter, a former Harvard Law School 
professor. Frankfurter also browbeat his colleagues and ended up alienating 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Still smarting after his bitter Senate confirmation fight, Thomas has not 
emerged as a player. He never asks questions in oral arguments, writes few 
opinions and sides so often with Scalia that the latter is said to have two 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The right wing of the Rehnquist court thus appears reconciled to denying 
review to cases it knows it cannot win a majority on. The court's moderate 
centrists, on the other hand, appear in no mood for more acrimonious battles 
over such controversial issues as abortion. That is why the court has refused 
to grant several abortion cases in the last several terms. With the high 
turnover in membership, the centrists are also undoubtedly biding their time, 
waiting for their numbers to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Another case in point was the court's denial, on Oct. 12, of an important 
appellate-court ruling on the First Amendment's separation of government from 
religion. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a 43-foot cross, 
and a San Diego landmark for more than 40 years, could no longer stand on 
public property because it violated the First Amendment disestablishment 
clause. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of case that, a few years ago, Rehnquist and Scalia would 
have jumped at. They would have done so with a view to reversing the lower 
court's decision and, perhaps, getting rid of liberal precedents upholding a 
"high wall of separation" between government and religion. But after taking 
several such cases in recent years and losing to the court's centrists, they 
preferred to minimize their losses. As with abortion, the court's centrists 
have reaffirmed liberal precedents on the First Amendment's disestablishment 
clause. For them, the Ninth Circuit's ruling was correct and should be left 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuredly, the Rehnquist court is not going to vanish from public view. Many 
of the cases that were once granted, but now simply denied, involve statutory 
matters and conflicts in the lower courts. Congress may -- and does -- resolve 
such conflicts by passing new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 But this term, for example, the court has already agreed to decide some major 
controversial social issues. The justices will consider the constitutionality 
of state-imposed term limits on members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 
and the constitutionality of a federal gun-control law. The court has also 
granted a major challenge to affirmative-action programs, an important 
school-desegregation case and several others involving freedom of speech under 
the First Amendment. The justices will decide as well whether states may 
provide lower welfare benefits to new residents. However the court rules in 
these and other cases, charges of "judicial activism" will undoubtedly be heard 
from some quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, moreover, can run but it cannot hide from the major social 
conflicts in the land. A whole batch of voting-rights cases are in the wings. 
The issue of homosexual rights is certain to be before the court before long -- 
whether as an appeal of decisions on gays and lesbians in the military or of 
the Colorado state supreme court's recent ruling striking down a state 
constitutional amendment that forbid localities from passing ordinances 
protecting homosexuals. Sooner or later, the court will also have to clarify 
the status of abortion rights and what restrictions on women's access to 
abortion constitute an "undue burden" under its Casey ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for the foreseeable future, the moderate centrists on the Rehnquist 
court are in control and likely to prevail. They have no liberal agenda for 
judicial activism. But neither do they share the right wing's conservative 
agenda for reaching out to grant cases to overturn liberal precedents. The 
court's centrists will prevent Rehnquist and company from engaging in that 
brand of "judicial activism" as well.*

SURFER'S BEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I too was surfing at Malibu the morning of Richard Ernsdorf's savage beating 
at the hands of contestants of the Assn. of Surfing Professionals Oxbow World 
Longboard Championship (Oct. 7). I saw Ernsdorf bleeding on the beach and at 
the time assumed he had met with an accident in the surf.It never occurred to 
me that he had been beaten by participants in the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent my entire life surfing in California, I am shocked but not that 
surprised by this incident. "Professional" surfing has created a whole group of 
money-hungry surfers who have completely lost sight of what the sport is really 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Malibu will now seriously consider the elimination of these silly 
contests that tie up public access to our beaches.

COUNTY AND LOCAL PROPOSITIONS THAT MERIT THE VOTERS' SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters in Los Angeles County will find one county and several local 
propositions on the Nov. 8 ballot. The Times endorses the following selected 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- CHARTER AMENDMENT A: Gives the County Board of 
Supervisors flexibility to increase or decrease the compensation for the post 
of district attorney, assessor or sheriff. (The assessor earns $124,000 a year, 
the district attorney $159,000 and the sheriff $202,000.) 
</P>
<P>
 Charter Amendment A would permit the board to increase or decrease the pay of 
a midterm appointee in any of these offices or, 30 days or more before an 
election, to increase or decrease the compensation of a yet-to-be-elected 
non-incumbent ; the compensation of a reelected incumbent would not be 
affected. (All five supervisors support the measure on the ground it could save 
county money. Vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
 EL RANCHO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT -- BOND MEASURE C: Permits the El Rancho 
Unified School District in Pico Rivera to issue $13.3 million in 
general-obligation bonds in order to upgrade facilities including fire, 
earthquake, electrical and security systems; provide students with access to 
modern technology; renovate or replace obsolete facilities; construct permanent 
facilities, and make improvements to older buildings on district property. The 
measure requires a two-thirds majority vote for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters last approved new bonds in 1969; repayment of those bonds through a 
property tax averaging $27 a year is to continue for three years. If approved, 
Measure C would continue this $27-a-year average property assessment for a 
period not to exceed 25 years. Improving schools deserves voter support. 
</P>
<P>
 LA VERNE, LANCASTER, SAN DIMAS AND WALNUT -- MEASURES E, F, G AND L: Asks 
voters in each of these cities if they support the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors creation of a community facilities district (CFD). This is an 
advisory vote only. Property owners in cities that join the CFD would be 
subject to an assessment on their property taxes, when needed, to increase 
materials, hours and days of service at the county public library branches in 
their communities. In recent years the budget of the county public library 
system has lost about $30 million because of cutbacks in state allocations of 
property tax money. The board recently decided to use $22.5 million in general 
funds instead of imposing assessments. But the CFD was not dismantled and will 
be needed if assessments are considered again in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Unincorporated areas of the county, with their 28 branch libraries, are 
automatically included in the CFD. Incorporated communities can be included 
only if their city councils approve. La Verne, Lancaster, San Dimas and Walnut 
are holding the advisory vote to determine whether their communities favor 
being included in the CFD in fiscal year 1995-96. Voters should support these 
library measures. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG BEACH -- BOND MEASURE D: Authorizes the issuance of up to $48 million in 
general-obligation bonds to finance improvements to city facilities, bringing 
them into compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act. Under Title II 
of the act, the city is required to make its programs, services and activities 
accessible to people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, Long Beach has no other general-bond indebtedness. The measure is 
endorsed by the mayor, the City Council and the city's police officers and 
firefighters, as well as the city's Citizens Advisory Commission on 
Disabilities. Measure D deserves a "yes" vote. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN MARINO -- SPECIAL TAX I: Renews a special public safety tax for paramedic 
services, police protection and fire protection and prevention. The current 
levy expires in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 Revenues raised by the tax, which requires approval by two-thirds of those 
voting, could be used only for police, fire and paramedic services. In fiscal 
year 1995-96, owners of the smallest homes would pay no more than $324, owners 
of the largest homes a maximum of $881 and the average homeowner $447. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance -- which provides tax credits for seniors and for some 
homeowners who bought their homes in particular years -- would expire June 30, 
1999. Extending the levy makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 SANTA MONICA -- CHARTER AMENDMENT J: The Santa Monica City Charter currently 
requires that the complete text of a newly adopted ordinance be published in a 
newspaper within 15 days of the ordinance's adoption by the City Council. 
Amendment J authorizes the publication of an ordinance's summary, prepared by 
the city attorney, instead of the complete text. This would be consistent with 
state law, which permits the publication of ordinance summaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual cost of publishing the city's new ordinances (which average 54 per 
year) ranges from $40,000 to $60,000. The amendment would save the city money. 
Vote "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 SANTA MONICA/MALIBU UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT -- MEASURE K: Permits the Santa 
Monica/Malibu Unified School District to continue a special tax that funds 
educational improvements in the district. The district's board is now asking 
voters to extend the $58 special parcel tax for six years and increase it to 
$68 per parcel annually. The measure requires a two-thirds majority for 
passage. It deserves approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times believes these measures all deserve support on Election Day.

IQ AND SOCIAL JUSTICE; WHAT GOOD CAN BE SERVED BY RACIAL-INEQUITY THEORIES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A century ago, the British statistician Karl Pearson argued that genetically 
inferior people were outbreeding superior ones and that the human species was 
degenerating by dysgenics. His thinking helped spawn the scientifically 
baseless eugenics movement that later led to the sterilization of thousands of 
"feeble-minded" people in the United States and Europe. Eugenics was perverted 
into the ultimate murderous evil by the Nazis to justify the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes a new wave of this old dysgenics to explain the woes of modern 
times. This time it is in the form of a provocative and deeply depressing new 
book that maintains that human intelligence is largely inherited and that 
blacks, on average, are intellectually inferior to whites, who in turn are 
slightly less intelligent than Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is "The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American 
Life," by the late psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein of Harvard and the 
political scientist Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute. In 845 
pages of sharp rhetoric and dense statistics they argue that the United States 
is being polarized between an "emerging cognitive elite" and a low-IQ 
underclass destined, in disproportionate numbers, to lives of crime and welfare 
dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 They see this "cognitive partitioning" widening, and argue that affirmative 
action in education and jobs has only increased tensions among races without 
reducing differences in accomplishment. They call for cutbacks in welfare and 
other government programs to discourage people with low IQs from reproducing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bell Curve" has fueled a fierce new debate on a stale topic. It comes out at 
about the same time as two other books that, with differing rhetoric and 
purpose, make similar arguments. The two others are "The Decline of 
Intelligence in America: A Strategy for National Renewal," by Seymour W. 
Itzkoff of Smith College, and "Race, Evolution, and Behavior: A Life History 
Perspective," by J. Philippe Rushton of the University of Western Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly these scholars are right to discern a racially polarized class 
structure. Herrnstein and Murray argue for the primacy of IQ, rejecting 
contentions that differences in scores are rooted in cultural biases of tests. 
</P>
<P>
 But we are not convinced the science is adequate to distinguish the genetic 
component of IQ from environmental factors -- such as historical 
discrimination, long-term poverty and alcohol and drug abuse. IQ studies have 
long been plagued by methodological problems and even whiffs of fraud and 
racial politics. Nor does "Bell Curve" deal adequately with the possibility 
there are many kinds of intelligence other than the cognitive ability measured 
by IQ tests. And it is difficult to reconcile the Herrnstein-Murray argument 
with the expansion of an affluent black middle class in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, we strongly oppose censoring such controversial research. And we 
denounce campus thought police who would harass scholars who dare to undertake 
it. Still, it must be asked: What is the real purpose of such research? 
</P>
<P>
 Herrnstein's and Murray's answer is that we need less social engineering by 
government and a "return to individualism," meaning less emphasis on group 
identification. The stress, they say, should be on "finding valued places if 
you aren't very smart." That was easier in past times, they argue, when the 
economy was agrarian and manual labor more valued. 
</P>
<P>
 They say local neighborhoods rather than government should now assume 
responsibility for many social functions to "multiply the valued places that 
people can fill." In other words, in their words: "It is time for America once 
again to try living with inequality, as life is lived. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 We find that a defeatist conclusion. Past studies attempting to link race and 
IQ have often given comfort to the forces of evil, stigmatizing large groups 
and legitimizing even murder. We see little chance of a resurgence of eugenics. 
But nothing is to be gained by resigning ourselves to a biological fate of two 
separate and unequal societies.

L.A. CAMP FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article "Homeless Camp Weighed in L.A. Industrial Area" (Oct. 14) greatly 
concerns me, and many homeless advocates with whom I've spoken. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan to shuttle homeless people to a four-to-six-acre fenced lot, with no 
rules on drugs, was described as a major component of a joint city and county 
effort to reduce homelessness. Fifty beds, along with restrooms, a shower area 
and a large grass area for "resting purposes" will not reduce the number of 
homeless people. And this type of environment is neither appropriate nor safe 
for the most rapidly growing segment of the homeless population -- women and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 A more realistic approach to the homeless problem is for government to work 
alongside the existing social agencies that have much more experience with the 
issue of homelessness to pursue long-term solutions.  
</P>
<P>
 With over 103 years experience, the Union Rescue Mission is committed to 
breaking the cycle of homelessness. Along with many other social service 
agencies Downtown, we provide comprehensive programs that attack the problems 
that made them homeless in the first place. Our programs include training in 
the occupational skills that help secure jobs, guidance and practical 
experience with managing personal finances, counseling and family services, 
youth outreach, and chapel services where God's love can be shared and 
demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month thousands of community members, along with business leaders 
and government representatives visited our new 225,000-square-foot facility, 
which has an 810-bed capacity -- with separate facilities for women and 
children. It's complete with a health center to be staffed by the UCLA School 
of Nursing, a learning center, a gymnasium and children's play areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't government spend $4 million on programs that will make a 
difference -- like helping those with mental illnesses or drug abuse problems, 
or subsidizing housing move-in costs -- $4 million could pay for thousands of 
apartments and many hours of professional treatment.

 * The appalling plan of the Riordan Administration and Central City Assn. 
(CCA) to re-create Nazi Germany in Downtown Los Angeles is no short-term, and 
definitely not long-term, solution to homelessness. Since when did the mark of 
a civilized society translate into providing camps rather than decent and 
permanent housing? The plan itself is inhumane and indecent, and continues a 
pattern of injustice for the least, the last and the lost in our society. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, Downtown business interests have been deriding the 
homeless, rather than putting forth strategies for economic development that 
include the homeless and their social providers. Such an effort would address 
the real problem of failing bottom lines and the cause of homelessness, which 
is a struggling local economy. Rather than building concentration camps for the 
homeless with U.S. Housing and Urban Development funds, the Riordan 
Administration should be exploring opportunities to bestow dignity and a sense 
of empowerment among the homeless.

GETTY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Getty Center will no doubt be a magnificent addition to Los Angeles' array 
of cultural institutions (Oct. 10), but the location is unfortunate in many 
ways. The Getty Center is being built at a relatively isolated hilltop site, 
accessible only by automobiles (internal tram system notwithstanding).This 
approach perpetuates suburban sprawl at a time when other cities -- like San 
Francisco and Seattle -- are gathering their museums and cultural institutions 
back into their downtowns. Imagine the stimulus to the revitalization of 
Downtown Los Angeles or Hollywood that the Getty Center could have brought to 
either area -- both through its initial investment and the ongoing stream of 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning in Los Angeles has adopted a rhetoric of being friendly to 
pedestrians, but the fact that this splendid project is being built in splendid 
isolation shows that the words have yet to become reality.

 * While the view from the Getty may be beautiful, the view from below this 
eyesore makes me cringe. In the middle of beautiful mountains is this ugly mess 
of grading and asphalt. The Times trivializes the irreversible ruin of a 
mountain by saying most of the criticism is just from jealous Eastern critics. 
If they ever saw the carved up mountainside that is supposedly "connecting" the 
center to the city their jealousy might be checked a bit. I know the people who 
live and drive by this site sure don't suffer from this jealousy problem. What 
comes to mind is one word: rape.

POLLUTING CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Polluters Beware: Smog Sentries Will Soon Be Manning Their Posts," Oct. 
10: 
</P>
<P>
 While I wholeheartedly support the SCAQMD's determination to crack down on the 
relatively few vehicles that produce the lion's share of the air pollution, I 
must protest the planned, massive giveaway of taxpayer funds to subsidize the 
repair or replacement of the offending vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the crackdown will "disproportionately affect certain economic 
classes."It only takes a little common sense to realize the majority of the 
offending vehicles are older, poorly maintained vehicles that are owned by 
people who can't afford to properly maintain them. But since when is it the 
taxpayer's obligation to pay for the maintenance of private individuals' 
vehicles? If their tires or brakes don't meet the minimum legal safety 
standards, should we pay to repair those too? If the owner can't afford 
liability insurance, should the taxpayers purchase that too? This is totally 
absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 If someone can't afford to properly maintain his car (and purchase insurance), 
then he can't afford to drive it. If he continues to drive it after being 
cited, then the vehicle should be impounded. Period.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; ENOUGH IS MORE THAN ENOUGH; WE CAN'T AFFORD ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION. PROP. 187 FORCES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAROLD W. EZELL, Harold W. Ezell, a co-author of Proposition 187, was 
commissioner of the INS' Western region from 1983 to 1989. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The issue of illegal immigration is color-blind; it is not a racial but a 
legal issue. It is an issue that taxpayers, who have seen our tax dollars 
squandered on programs that have nothing to do with American citizens or legal 
aliens, understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of us must ask ourselves: How many illegals can we educate, medicate, 
compensate and incarcerate before California goes bankrupt? Can we continue 
business as usual, wasting taxpayer dollars? 
</P>
<P>
 The opponents of 187 say it's flawed, poorly written, doesn't really answer 
the question of illegal immigration and costs too much. They agree that 
something must be done, but they have no solution. The Democratic Party elder 
statesman, former Sen. Eugene McCarthy, says, "The 'save our state' initiative 
is a way to let the government know people aren't happy with things as they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is not the total answer, but it is a piece of the puzzle. It 
will send a message that even the White House will understand. We must do 
something about our borders. Californians are not going to reward and 
underwrite those who come here illegally, whether by land, sea or air. Let the 
White House sue us for not paying for illegals. 
</P>
<P>
 The widow of the late Howard Jarvis, founder of the taxpayers' revolt in the 
1970s and the father of Proposition 13, told me that she spent many hours 
gathering signatures for Proposition 187. "If Howard was alive," Estelle Jarvis 
said, "he would stand shoulder to shoulder with you and see that Proposition 
187 becomes a reality."  
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is the Proposition 13 of the 1990s. Just as Proposition 13 had 
its impact on all state and local candidates, so will Proposition 187. Gov. 
Pete Wilson says yes on 187. What does your politician say? 
</P>
<P>
 We have heard the opponents say that $15 billion, which the federal government 
pays to California annually, will be taken away if Proposition 187 becomes law. 
That's baloney; the chances of that happening are as good as that of the 
Clinton Administration balancing the budget in 1996. Does anyone really believe 
that the Clinton Administration would take one dime from the most populous 
state in the nation? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the truth behind the myth of the $15 billion. The federal government 
pays annually $3 billion for education costs in California. These funds would 
not be lost. Passage of 187 will require the attorney general to go to the U.S. 
Supreme Court to test the Plyler vs. Doe decision of 1982. This bad decision 
allows any 5-year-old, here legally or not, to get a free, 12-year education 
plus college. We can't afford this. Proposition 187 would force the Supreme 
Court to revisit the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, $9 billion is spent annually for medical reimbursement to the 
state of California. California taxpayers alone are paying $400 million per 
year to provide medical care to approximately 317,000 illegals. The California 
Medical Assn. wants our dollars without accountability. They say that we cannot 
ask a person if they are legally in the United States, that it's against 
federal law. This is not true. The First District Court of Appeals in 
California said in August that we can ask. The court upheld the 1992 state law 
requiring all medical applicants to disclose their Social Security numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional $3 billion that our opponents say Uncle Sam will "take away" is 
for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or welfare. Proposition 187 has 
nothing to do with children born here, who are citizens whether or not their 
parents are legal and thus entitled to the federal AFDC.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chicken Little opponents, who say the sky is falling if you vote yes on 
187, are not telling the truth. California taxpayers are spending 10% of state 
general funds to underwrite illegal immigration -- $3.4 billion per year. 
Proposition 187 would cost several million to implement, while saving billions. 
This is a good investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Our opponents ignore the Proposition 187 provisions that require law 
enforcement cooperation among state and local agencies and the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. This initiative requires local law enforcement agencies 
to cooperate when they come in contact with illegals. Maybe this is why L.A. 
County Sheriff Sherman Block is a "No on 187" spokesperson. It's hard for me to 
understand why Block, whose county has the largest population of illegals in 
the nation and who has sworn to uphold the laws of the land, will not allow his 
officers to cooperate with the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 Another important provision of Proposition 187 is a change in the state penal 
code that would make it a felony, with a five-year prison term and a $75,000 
fine, to manufacture, sell or distribute phony documents. A $25,000 fine and 
five-year prison term would apply if an individual uses a phony document to get 
a benefit. This would be a major help in the enforcement of employer sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is not enough, but it tells the federal government that 
California has had enough and we're not going to take it any more.

THE EVERGREEN FIELDS OF YELLOW JOURNALISM; MEDIA: WHEN TABLOIDS STOP 
ENTERTAINING, PEOPLE WILL STOP BUYING THEM. JUST DON'T EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN IN 
YOUR LIFETIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE SALTZMAN, Joe Saltzman, professor of journalism at USC, is an 
award-winning, broadcast journalist who writes on the media. He is currently 
working on a series of books dealing with the image of the journalist in 
popular culture. 
</P>

 Television news . . . is under fire. The target is . . . a creeping 
tabloidization. . . . More or less respectable news programs are succumbing to 
the subjects and techniques of the gossip show . . . television journalists are 
chasing ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New York Times, 1994 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance of Tainted Tabloids and Respectable Press in the cause of banner 
headlines has produced an alien, grotesquely formed multi-being that includes 
television newsmagazines. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Los Angeles Times, 1994

<P>
 Even papers which seem safely beyond the reach of tabloid competition are 
alarmed by their mushroom growth and tend to imitate many of their most 
undesirable characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New Republic, 1927 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing so disgraceful as the behavior of two of these newspapers this week 
has been known in the history of American journalism. Gross misrepresentation 
of the facts, deliberate invention of tales calculated to excite the public, 
and wanton recklessness in the construction of headlines which even outdid 
these inventions . . . it is a crying shame that men should work such mischief 
in order to sell more papers. . . . The reason why such journals lie is that it 
pays to lie. A yellow journal office is probably the nearest approach, in 
atmosphere, to hell, existing in any Christian state. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New York Evening Post, 1898 
</P>
<P>
 The moment a wretch commits or is supposed to commit a murder, he becomes the 
hero of popular imagination . . . this growing sympathy in favor of all sorts 
of criminals, and this habit of making their crimes . . . illustrious by 
conferring fictitious importance on the perpetrators, are calculated to 
diminish our abhorrence of crime and encourage its commission. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New York Courier and Enquirer, 1836 
</P>
<P>
 The Press is now employed by paper-wasters, by mercenary souls . . . who 
weekly utter, slanders, libels, lies, under the name of specious novelties . . 
. They are all accused of lying and of detracting from the reputation of the 
famous and the glorious. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Anonymous London pamphlet, 1645. 
</P>
<P>
 A modern supermarket tabloid editor once said that it didn't much matter what 
the critics said about his newspaper. "We're judged," he carefully pointed out, 
"every week by the people who buy our product. If they don't like what we're 
doing, they just stop buying our newspaper. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it has always been that simple. When the tabloid product ceases to 
inform or entertain or amuse or satisfy, then no one will buy it and the media 
will move on to other ways of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't hold your breath waiting for this to happen. It was good enough for 
our ancestors 300 years ago and it's a good bet that it will be good enough for 
our progeny 300 years from now.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN; OF PRIVACY AND THE PRESS: 
THE DILEMMA OF MODERN POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By Steve Proffitt, Proffitt is a producer for Fox News and a contributor to 
National Public Radio's All Things Considered and Morning Edition. He spoke 
with Goodwin from her home in Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doris Kearns Goodwin tells a story about how, if she were a journalist, she 
would have been kicked out of the business. In August, 1976, she traveled to 
Plains, Ga., to interview presidential candidate Jimmy Carter. Goodwin, a 
political-science teacher at Harvard, had just published her first major 
biography, "Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream." The Ladies' Home Journal 
had hired her to write an article. She asked Carter about morality and 
fidelity. He told her that his greatest feelings of guilt came from the lust he 
felt in his heart for women other than his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin returned home, and talked about the lust comment with her husband, the 
former Kennedy aide Richard N. Goodwin, and friends. But when she wrote her 
story, she left it out. A few days later, Carter made similar comments in what 
was the first-ever presidential contender's Playboy magazine interview. "I have 
lusted in my heart," became a headline and a political flash-point of the 
Carter campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, politicians appear on Oprah, MTV and Howard Stern. California 
gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown reveals the date rape of one of her 
daughters during a televised political debate. Prince Charles confesses he 
never loved his wife, and that his father forced him to marry her. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as the historian and biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin reminds us it was 
not so long ago that political figures could draw a line between their private 
and public lives. Her latest biography, "No Ordinary Time," focuses on the 
private and separate lives of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt -- and on his 
longtime affair with Lucy Mercer. These details, while now the fascinating 
stuff of history, were not considered news at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, such details are reported without delay. Hillary Rodham Clinton 
appears with her husband to answer infidelity charges on "60 Minutes." 
Mainstream news organizations station reporters in Little Rock to canvas bars 
for "bad stuff about Bill." Every part of a public person's life is open to 
scrutiny, and Goodwin, along with a number of other Americans, is not sure 
that's such a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin, 51, has written biographies of three Democratic Presidents -- 
Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Johnson. She recently appeared as an oft-quoted 
voice in Ken Burns' "Baseball." In a conversation that ping-ponged across 60 
years of political history, she talked about the presidency, the press and the 
distinction between historical insight and momentary prurient interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: In the 1930s, when a candidate like Franklin Roosevelt ran for 
President, didn't he naturally assume that a certain part of his life was 
private?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Absolutely. It was an assumption as natural to them as the air they 
breathed. They understood they had protection for that part of their life they 
wanted to reserve for themselves, and there was not a worry that someone would 
intrude upon it. Part of it for FDR was his confidence, and the lines that he 
drew. He understood that public life had certain demands, but I think he 
believed that there was a certain core about his life which would never have to 
be revealed publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, on the evening news on TV, there was a rundown of the political races 
in the country, and of all the places where people with absolutely no 
experience in politics are overtaking incumbents. That has something to do with 
the fact that people who are in politics are now diminished simply by being 
there. And many are saying it's better to have someone who's never held office, 
who has no record. There's no other craft, no other skill where we prefer 
someone with no experience. Something has happened in politics where people 
have lost their private side, and lost themselves, somehow. In FDR's day, there 
was the sense that one could hold onto the most private parts of one's life, 
the parts that one valued the most. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Wouldn't John Kennedy have had a similar expectation of privacy in 1960?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There may have been some perception -- which proved to be wrong -- that 
once he got into the White House, there would have to be more discretion. But I 
think once he got in there, he realized the White House was a very easy place 
to live his life privately. It allowed him to have the kind of private life 
which we later discovered but, at the time, people were not aware of. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So how did we get from a place where FDR could have essentially a surrogate 
wife in the White House, and JFK could exercise an incredibly active libido, to 
a place where every alleged peccadillo is now common knowledge?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Somehow, the whole relationship between the press and the politicians 
changed. During Roosevelt's time, the newspapers were mostly owned by 
Republicans, so it wasn't like he was given an easy ride. The White House press 
corps was there to get information about the presidency. But they weren't 
exposing or investigating him. He opened up twice a week in press conferences 
and gave them the information they needed to write their stories. They didn't 
feel compelled to follow him around to get more information. When he went on 
vacation, what he did every moment wasn't news. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere, probably beginning around the mid-1960s, the disenchantment with 
Vietnam, Johnson's credibility gap and Nixon's Watergate created a much 
different kind of adversarial press. Investigative reporters were the role 
models for young people, and exposure became a part of the culture. 
</P>
<P>
 I think now the politicians, because they are so afraid of fighting the press, 
give in to it. They allow themselves to be followed around on their vacations, 
they talk about their private lives as if they are on Phil Donahue or Oprah 
Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband, Richard, traveled with John Kennedy during the 1960 campaign, and 
he says Kennedy knew not to put on a cowboy hat or an Indian headdress. Because 
even if, at that moment, the person might be pleased that he did it, later it 
could come back to make him look foolish. I think politicians need to have a 
sense of guarding their dignity, especially the President. I mean, no one would 
have ever thought of asking FDR about his underwear -- whether he wore boxers 
or briefs -- and he certainly would have never answered. Once you answer those 
questions, you open the door to the press, and allow them to dance on the other 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does it say about us as a society -- specifically as a democratic 
society -- when we are so obsessed with these little personal details of our 
leaders?  
</P>
<P>
 A: If people were rational with themselves, I don't think they would feel good 
about the way it's all going. I think back to FDR. He made the assumption that 
the country wouldn't accept his paralysis -- the fact that he was a paraplegic. 
So he conducted what someone else has called "a splendid deception" by never 
allowing the public to see him with his braces, or in his wheelchair, or being 
carried from a car. The press went along with that because they must have felt 
it was important for the country to feel a sense of strength about their 
leader. But what if Roosevelt had challenged the assumption that he wouldn't be 
accepted as a paraplegic, and had been able to admit to his vulnerability? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And yet today, don't Presidents have to maintain an almost impossible 
balance between the dignified and imperial, and the approachable and 
personable?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, and what they define now as personable is allowing people to know 
things like what makes you sad, what difficulties you've had in your life. 
Roosevelt, despite being from a very privileged background, was a man the 
common person adored. But that didn't mean he had to talk about how he felt 
when his father died, or how overbearing his mother was, or that he'd fallen in 
love with another women. Somehow he was able to appeal to the democratic 
instinct without that layer being stripped away. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, though, it seems Freud has gone amok. When Freud first started, it was 
probably a helpful thing to undo repression and talk about things that were 
hidden. But while it may seem that we want to know all these intimate details 
about our leaders, and we may relish them, if they were taken away from us, and 
we ended up feeling more respect for them, they might be able to govern better, 
and we might all feel better about everything in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are we going to extricate ourselves from this cult of personal 
knowledge, and can a person today run for high political office and say, "Wait 
a minute, this is none of your business, I draw the line here, I have a private 
life"?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I have a feeling that if the leader had enough confidence in himself to be 
able to say -- and mean -- "I draw the line," my suspicion is that both the 
press and the public would respect it. Think for a moment of Jackie Kennedy -- 
who went to extremes to keep her life private. In the end, everyone is saying, 
even people in the press, "Oh, I admire her so much because she wouldn't let us 
talk to her." Perhaps she could get away with it because she wasn't running for 
office -- but it shows the other side is out there. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were advising Clinton, I would say go back to regular press conferences 
-- do it once a week. Then when he goes on vacation, or when they ask about his 
daughter, Clinton can say, "I will talk to you about my public life, but my 
private life is my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have a candidate for governor here in California -- Kathleen Brown -- 
who announced in a debate that her daughter had been raped on a date. The 
feeling here is that the remark may have helped her campaign. How does it 
strike you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I can see it as a dramatic answer to a question. She must have prepared for 
it -- I can't imagine it just came out. But I think if people think about it 
over time, they're going to feel queasy. I remember feeling queasy when Vice 
President Gore talked about the near-death of his child, and the child was 
right there, and all the spotlights go on him. The problem here is that you 
can't have it both ways. You cannot use that dramatic private moment to your 
own advantage and then turn around and say to the press, "You gotta leave me 
alone!" 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there a relationship between the thirst for all these intimate details 
and the level of animosity that characterizes so many political campaigns 
today?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Let me go back to Roosevelt. During the 1940 campaign, he learned that 
Wendell Wilkie was having an affair. Roosevelt decided not to use that stuff, 
and Wilkie must have had some knowledge about the unconventional relationships 
that were going on in the White House. As a result, even though the campaign 
was quite sharp, it didn't descend into that lower level. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the dirty tricks of the 1960s -- they seem so innocent by today's 
standards. Once, during a Nixon campaign speech, the Democrats sent in a bunch 
of women dressed as nuns, and they all appeared to be pregnant, and all held 
signs saying "Nixon's the One" -- his campaign slogan. That's nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 But I've always thought that if investigative reporters looked into other, 
more important things -- patterns, like how he treated his staff, was he mean 
to the people he worked with -- those are really important things to know. But 
instead, we go into these deep, personal things, which don't really mean much 
of anything. A lousy husband can be a great leader, or vice versa. I'd much 
rather know how someone handled a crisis than how they handled their romantic 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you feel any optimism that our country's leaders can come through this 
orgy of revelation, and come out the other side with some dignity?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, one problem is that people who feel strongly about this are probably 
selecting out of politics -- we have no idea how many potential leaders are 
just not willing to get involved now, because they know their pasts are not 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Lincoln used to say, "Show me a man without vices and I'll show you a 
man without virtues." People are flawed. I remember I used to laugh about the 
fact that all we knew about Richard Nixon's sex life was that he liked to stand 
around at night in his striped pajamas and talk to Bebe Rebozo on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 My point is, I don't think we really want such narrow characters as our 
leaders. It would be interesting if Roosevelt were coming on the scene today, 
because what he had was utter self-confidence. It was the largest part of his 
leadership and it was a contagious confidence that somehow got the country 
through the Depression and the war. It will take someone with that kind of 
confidence to say, "These are legitimate issues of public concern, and these 
are private matters." 
</P>
<P>
 And I really feel there are enough people within the press who don't like 
what's going on, who feel the tabloids are leading the legitimate press. So 
perhaps things will get better. I don't think everything always has to get 
worse and worse. But the truth is, I don't know.*
