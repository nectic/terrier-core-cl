MOVIE REVIEW; 'IRON WILL' FULL OF HEART AND HOPE; THE FILM IS A THROWBACK TO 
THE SWEET DISNEY FAMILY ONES THAT WALT HIMSELF LOVED, A LIVE-ACTION FAIRY TALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Like the earnest young man it's named after, "Iron Will" (citywide) would 
blush and protest if any kind of fuss were made over it. Just doing my job, 
sir, this film would say if it could talk, no need to make me out to be more 
than I am. 
</P>
<P>
 True enough, but it is "Iron Will's" double charm that its aspirations are 
humble and straightforward and that it fulfills them so completely. Not as 
slick as "Free Willy" or as sophisticated as "Searching for Bobby Fischer," 
this is a throwback to the sweet and sentimental Disney family films that Walt 
himself loved, a live-action fairy tale about a boy, his dogs and a darn tough 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in 1917 and "inspired by" a real event, "Iron Will" shrewdly does not 
attempt to modernize its story or make it hipper for the nominally more 
sophisticated kids who are its core audience. It sees the world the same way 
its open and innocent protagonist, Will Stoneman (Mackenzie Astin) does, as a 
manageable place where enthusiasm and heart are enough to solve any problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A passionate dog-sledder who lives deep in snowbound South Dakota, Will, who 
has just been accepted to college, is ambivalent about going and no wonder: Who 
would want to leave a dad like Jack (John Terry), the most understanding guy in 
12 states who speaks only in aphorisms like "Don't let fear stand in the way of 
your dreams" and "If there's something you really want, you've got to go out 
and grab it." 
</P>
<P>
 But then, in a cruel moment that probably accounts for the film's PG rating, 
Jack dies in an accident and Will must face not only the lack of money for 
college but the family's financial ruin. Then he remembers the Carnival Derby, 
"the longest, toughest, richest dog race ever," with a problem-solving $10,000 
going to the first team to cross the 500 miles from Winnipeg, Manitoba, to St. 
Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tutelage of medicine-ball-throwing family friend Ned Dodd (August 
Schellenberg), a Native American whose store of tribal aphorisms rivals those 
of the late Jack, Will toughens himself up for a race across "the meanest 
stretch of land God ever put together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And a good thing, too, because in addition to horrendous weather and 
topological features with names like Heartbreak Hill and Devil's Slide, Will 
has to face his other competitors. This fierce lot includes Borg Guillarson 
(George Gerdes), who looks like the Hannibal Lecter of cross-country sledding. 
</P>
<P>
 Will also contends with Kevin Spacey's cynical, jaded journalist, who dubs him 
Iron Will and says things like "This kid will put me on the front page." And he 
has to earn the respect of the redoubtable Gus, his father's old lead dog that 
has a heart, not to mention a bite, as big as all outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 All this can be made to sound quite silly, and in some ways it obviously is. 
But even though a mix-and-match trio of disparate screenwriters (74-year-old 
John Michael Hayes, who counts "Rear Window" and "To Catch a Thief" among his 
credits; "Runaway Train's" Djordje Milicevic and "Sleepless in Seattle's" Jeff 
Arch) are involved, "Iron Will" is unified and made endearing by the simplicity 
and belief that director Charles Haid and those in front of the camera bring to 
the personal drama and the pounding races. 
</P>
<P>
 Mackenzie Astin, whose first theatrical feature this is (as it is for director 
Haid), is perfectly cast as Will, bringing to the part not only the ability to 
look good on a sled but also a convincing rugged innocence and an ease with 
emotion, a quality he shares with his brother, Sean ("Rudy"), and their mother, 
Patty Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't forget those dogs. Brightly and vividly shot by cinematographer 
William Wages, the assorted huskies and malamutes look inexpressibly cheerful 
as they mush through the snow, a good humor that those who embrace the 
decidedly old-fashioned pleasures of "Iron Will" can easily share.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: YET ANOTHER JEWEL IN THE BBC CROWN; TELEVISION: 'TO PLAY THE 
KING' IS THE EXQUISITELY SINISTER FOUR-PART SEQUEL TO 1991'S SUPERB POLITICAL 
THRILLER 'HOUSE OF CARDS.' 
</P>

<P>
 God save the king . . . from Francis Urquhart. 
</P>
<P>
 When we last looked in on F.U. (as his closest associates call him), he was 
heaving Mattie Storin from the roof of the House of Commons to stop the young 
reporter (who was his lover) from blabbing about his homicidal ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Her jolting demise ended "House of Cards," the 1991 political thriller that 
PBS has just rerun on "Masterpiece Theatre" in advance of Sunday's start of the 
exquisitely sinister four-part sequel, "To Play the King." 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing to nose through the sewers of stench beneath the glittery salons of 
power, the new BBC series (airing Sunday at 9 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and 
KPBS-TV Channel 15, 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24) finds F.U. (Ian Richardson) 
as scheming and lethal as ever, but even more dangerous now that he has 
realized his dream of becoming England's prime minister. Bits of conscience now 
and then squirm their way through F.U.'s thick layers of greed and ambition, 
however, and he is tormented by memories of Mattie's death plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little debris from the past, that's all," Urquhart sniffs, making the 
camera his confidante in one of many short soliloquies that bring to mind 
Shakespeare. What he doesn't learn until much later is that Mattie 
tape-recorded her own murder. 
</P>
<P>
 More immediately troubling for F.U. is the realm's new king (Michael Kitchen), 
a Charles-ish monarch (with an ex-wife who's tall, blond and bitter) who 
doesn't know his place and, of all things, wants to "get something done." Even 
worse, the king's socially conscious idealism ("compassion babble," an Urquhart 
aide calls it) is the very antithesis of the Tory prime minister's own 
cutting-edge decadence and reactionary policies. More than a mere babbler, the 
earnest king is becoming a political threat -- in effect, the leader of the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strong words," F.U. tells us, arching a brow after one of the king's 
impassioned speeches on behalf of the underprivileged. "But I'm afraid we can't 
allow it." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how he seeks to disallow it is the diabolical center, and grisly humor, 
of Andrew Davies' script, adapted from a novel by Michael Dobbs. Deeply 
involved is F.U.'s wife and co-conspirator (Diane Fletcher), a woman of Lady 
Macbethian appetites and black-heartedness who nourishes her husband's dark and 
prurient nature, even becoming his procurer. What he needs, she slyly tells 
F.U., is something "or someone" to stimulate and bring out the best in him. "Or 
the worst," he smirks. 
</P>
<P>
 That striking someone turns out to be a cool, brainy, leggy political 
strategist (Kitty Aldridge), whose emergence as F.U.'s worshipful Trilby makes 
her an inner-circle rival of Tim Stamper (Colin Jeavons), the prime minister's 
longtime crony and Draconian political eel. 
</P>
<P>
 "To Play the King" is only partially the regal and historic England of tourist 
books. Director Paul Seed captures the degenerate extravagance of the musty 
royals, the partisan choreography of the House of Commons and, quite wickedly, 
the waxen redundancy of the House of Lords, where it seems dinosaurs come to 
doze. Yet his camera also finds that other London, where the homeless whom the 
king wants to rescue from oblivion sleep in cardboard boxes, beg for food and 
huddle for warmth over coal fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Meaty political dramas seem to come as naturally to the British as steak and 
kidney pie. British television stages good ones with the same determination 
that U.S. television grinds out exploitative movies about violent domestic 
crime. In that regard, "To Play the King" is at once a close relative and the 
reverse of "A Very British Coup," the fine English three-parter that ran on 
"Masterpiece Theatre" in 1989. It, too, pitted a secretly poisonous status quo 
against populist reformers. In the earlier scenario, however, the person 
representing dramatic change was in office, a newly seated Laborite prime 
minister whose deeply entrenched enemies saw him as a monstrous threat who 
showed "alarming signs of turning into a major statesman." 
</P>
<P>
 In "To Play the King," Urquhart uses almost the same words to describe the 
sincere but politically naive king. Like his Machiavellian counterparts in "A 
Very British Coup," moreover, Urquhart electronically bugs his foes, as the 
king's private remarks travel from his royal lips directly to F.U.'s ears. And 
in both stories, scandal and the tabloid press become the arsenal of 
powerbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To Play the King" glows with typical British acting depth. Kitchen, Aldridge, 
Jeavons and Fletcher are excellent. But it's Richardson, British TV's actor for 
all seasons, on whose Saville Row-padded shoulders these four hours of elegant, 
meticulously tailored fun largely rest. Hiding his ruthless guile behind a veil 
of silky smarmyness, Richardson's Urquhart is a powdered wig of a cad, 
observing those around him through glistening, predatory eyes. But when the 
smile vanishes, the thin lips harden, the jaw drops and the charm falls away, a 
Richard III-type villain fills the screen with quiet, glowering menace. 
</P>
<P>
 All of his kingdom for a horse. All of yours for more television like this.

MOVIE REVIEW; EASY TO SEE WHY 'LA STRADA' PUT FELLINI ON THE HIGH ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before he became too celebrated for a given name, before anyone even thought 
of tacking "esque" onto his last one, there was a time when Federico Fellini 
was just another promising Italian director with a background in neo-realism 
and a few charming films to his credit. Then came "La Strada" and nothing was 
the same again. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the Nuart in West Los Angeles for a one-week run, "La Strada" 
(Italian for "The Road") appears to have defied time. One of the indelible 
foreign films of the 1950s (it won an Oscar in 1956), "La Strada" brought a 
kind of poetry to the screen that dazzled audiences at the time and still works 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 A melding of the neo-realism in Fellini's past with the fable elements that 
were to dominate his future, "La Strada" is basically a three-character drama 
about the nature of loneliness and the elusiveness of love. Using the grit of 
neo-realism to combat any excessive sentimentality, Fellini and screenplay 
collaborators Tullio Pinelli and Ennio Flajano fashioned a story that is very 
simple on one level and anything but on another. 
</P>
<P>
 Described on paper, the three protagonists can sound as archetypal as 
characters on a tarot deck. First comes Zampano (Anthony Quinn), the traveling 
strong man, a ragged, unshaven lout who motors across Italy performing the same 
feeble stunt again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 As "La Strada" opens, Zampano has purchased the services of the slightly 
simple Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina) from her mother. She is to serve as his 
companion and partner in his act, and he treats her as brutally and unfeelingly 
as the pieces of iron chain he works with. 
</P>
<P>
 Very different is Il Matto (the Fool), played by American actor Richard 
Basehart, a whimsical, sophisticated high-wire clown that Zampano and Gelsomina 
meet on the road. Unable to resist teasing the cloddish Zampano and taking an 
interest in Gelsomina, the Fool precipitates a series of crises that end up 
redefining the lives of all concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 More even than Otello Martelli's cinematography or Nino Rota's mournful, 
melodic score, the acting by Basehart, Quinn and Masina defines "La Strada." 
Though all are excellent, it is Masina, whose marriage to Fellini gradually 
curtailed her career, who is most memorable. Part silent clown, part 
sophisticated child with a face that registers and magnifies every emotion, 
Masina's presence is one of the most magical in world cinema, and reason enough 
all by itself to make this revival worthwhile.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'ONCE A THIEF' PULLS OFF A DELIGHTFUL CAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his zesty "Once a Thief" (at the Monica 4-Plex), fresh from the second 
annual Festival Hong Kong, John Woo adds comedy to his usual potent blend of 
sentiment and action to create one of his most light-hearted entertainments, a 
terrific mix of slapstick and sophistication -- imagine "Rififi" with a Harold 
Lloyd/Keystone Cops touch. Woo and his writers have come up with one ingenious 
gag and stunt after another to show off a trio of charismatic stars -- Chow 
Yun-Fat, Leslie Cheung and Cherie Chung -- at their most dazzling. 
</P>
<P>
 They play a notably happy-go-lucky gang of big-league art thieves living in 
the utmost luxury in France, and their derring-do in Paris, the Riviera and 
later on, back in Hong Kong, become hilarious spoofs of intricate 
"Topkapi"-type heists and also elaborate safe-cracking jobs tossed in with 
Woo's trademark razzle-dazzle chases, hand-to-hand combat and gun battles. 
</P>
<P>
 The way in which Woo launches "Once a Thief" sets the tone for all that is to 
come. Joe (Chow Yun-Fat) spots a Modigliani in the Louvre and learns that it 
will be part of a shipment of art on loan for an exhibition in Nice. Cherie 
(Cherie Chung) distracts guards during the loading of the art onto a van, 
allowing her tiny dog to lift its leg on the crate containing the Modigliani, 
thus marking it. Later on the highway, Cherie and Jim (Leslie Cheung) drive 
erratically in front of the van to divert attention from Jim's parachuting onto 
the top of it; once inside, Jim will be able to identify the proper container 
simply through smell. From this point on, shenanigans like this multiply at a 
dizzying rate. 
</P>
<P>
 More than any contemporary action director, Woo keeps in mind that stunts mean 
little unless you can care about the people. Shrewdly, Woo dares to wait 40 
minutes into the film before revealing that the handsome Joe regards his 
romance with Cherie as merely a pleasant fling -- though there's always the 
hint that he feels more but doesn't choose to reveal it because he doesn't want 
to settle down. The boyish Jim, however, secretly loves Cherie seriously. By 
this time these thieves have displayed such charm and humor we're thoroughly 
hooked; indeed, among the many things Woo accomplishes in this film is to 
invoke the spirit of '30s screwball romantic comedy better than almost anyone 
else who has attempted to do so. Once again, Woo evokes genuine emotion by 
playing it against an action fantasy plot. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Cherie is most concerned that the trio retire after they sell 
the Modigliani to a shifty French collector, but he in turn tells them of a 
cursed painting he covets that is displayed under heavy security in a Riviera 
chateau spooky enough for Dracula. The introduction of this painting into the 
plot, plus a deft flashback showing our thieves as little street kids coached 
in pickpocketing and the like by a Hong Kong Fagin but also befriended by an 
avuncular cop, sets the stage for all the mayhem and comedy and romance to 
come, climaxing of course in one of Woo's bravura shootouts. "Once a Thief" may 
just be the dizziest yet endearing Hong Kong caper since "Peking Opera Blues."

MOVIE REVIEW; AMUSING ASIDES IN 'HOUSE PARTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hair of the dog that bit hip-hop fans? Nope. "House Party 3" (citywide) is as 
much hangover as holdover, a relatively spiritless sequel that puts the law of 
diminishing returns to the groggy proof again. The great fun that was the first 
one is as forgotten as a blackout by now. 
</P>
<P>
 Kid 'N Play (Christopher Reid and Christopher Martin) are back and now living 
in L.A., apparently retired from their own rap careers and running a management 
company so fledgling they resort to slight scams for cash flow. A minor one 
they pull on a seedy music-business bigwig, Showboat (Michael Colyar) -- who 
seems to have been lifted wholesale from a "Superfly" flick -- again gives the 
pair the prompting they need to spend much of the movie on the run from 
potential castraters. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from hulk-avoidance and creditor-dodging, the other half of any "House 
Party" movie is the romantic entanglements of Kid, the charmer whose high-rise 
hair is in elevator dreads now. This time he's engaged, not to saucy Sydney 
(Tisha Campbell, making a brief, tempting return), but to the sweetest of 
sweethearts, Veda (Angela Means). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The well-intentioned Kid is, of course, utterly beset by females in heat now 
that he's wearing an engagement ring -- and suffers the inevitable nightmare in 
which he's married by a winking preacher with cleavage deeper than the Grand 
Canyon -- while both he and his intended are surrounded by naysaying friends 
and family. Call it "Posse of the Bride." 
</P>
<P>
 Kid 'N Play are still OK, but their squabbling seems pretty half-hearted this 
time around. The picture is periodically resuscitated by some of its supporting 
players -- especially the very funny Bernie Mac as Uncle Vester, who more or 
less stands in here for the first film's Robin Harris as the lovably 
loud-mouthed authority figure, and who intermittently shouts the movie out of 
its slumber. The rap trio TLC, as the hot female act the heroes pretend to 
represent, also brightens up the affair in two fleeting scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the performers, professional thesps and cameo rappers alike, come 
through with charisma enough that it's not the most disagreeable hour and a 
half out, though you keep wishing they'd been given some business to do. (The 
best bits play like asides, not set pieces.) Scripter Takashi Bufford and 
director Eric Meza -- making a feature debut after a run of music videos -- 
aren't much help, resorting with alarming regularity to stereotypes that well 
pre-date hip-hop, from the ageist (look out for that senile aunt who digs porno 
movies) to the mildly blaxploitative. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers don't seem to have much faith in their own waning franchise, 
begun so promisingly by the long-gone Hudlin brothers four scant years ago. 
Shot by Anghel Decca, "HP3" looks a lot shoddier than both its predecessors, 
overstocked with under-lit extreme close-ups that suggest all involved expected 
a payoff on VHS rentals. "Home Video Party," indeed.

POP ALBUM CHART; 'BOX' PUSHES DOGGY DOGG OUT OF 'HOUSE'

 Snoop Doggy Dogg has been evicted from his "Dogg House"--the nickname for the 
No. 1 spot on the pop album chart--by Mariah Carey. His "Doggystyle" dropped to 
No. 4 and he probably won't take up residence on top, although the album should 
continue to be a big seller through the winter. Carey's "Music Box" is still 
reaping the benefits of her Thanksgiving TV special and her debut on the 
touring circuit late last year. Her single "Hero," which just slipped to No. 2 
on the pop singles chart, has been a major boost to album sales too. Reba 
McEntire quietly had one of the fastest-selling greatest hits albums in country 
music in many years. Her "Greatest Hits Volume Two," which jumped from No. 15 
to No. 9, is over the 2-million mark after four months on the chart. "All for 
Love," the single by the all-star trio of Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart and Sting, 
is the new pop chart leader. 04,48,06,08,08 Rank Rank 2 Weeks Last Weeks on the

HOME TECH / VIDEO: BIG NEWS IS RCA'S SMALL SATELLITE DISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The biggest new-product news at last week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las 
Vegas was the unveiling of the first compact home satellite TV programming 
system, due on the market this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 It's RCA's DSS (Direct Satellite Service), in which the signal is beamed from 
a satellite directly to a receiver dish attached to your home. This isn't one 
of those big unwieldy receiver dishes. The RCA unit is small -- just 18 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 What's noteworthy is the price. The RCA package, consisting of the dish, 
receiver/converter box and a universal remote, will retail at $700 -- before 
discounts. It's the first system that's compact and within the financial reach 
of many people. At the exhibit, RCA stressed that anyone who's relatively handy 
around the house can set it up. Another major selling point will be the 
laser-disc quality of the picture provided by the system. 
</P>
<P>
 You won't have to go to obscure outlets to find this product. It will be 
offered by both Sears Brand Central and Circuit City. 
</P>
<P>
 This is different from the satellite dishes that pull in stations from all 
over the country. The RCA system, which has a 150-channel capacity, is more 
like cable, offering service on specific stations. Two companies will provide 
programming: USSB and DirecTv. You'll be offered channels like Showtime and HBO 
that are already available but many that will be exclusive to the system, which 
also has pay-per-view capability. 
</P>
<P>
 What it amounts to is an additional, cable-like service, offering many new 
shows with laser-disc-quality clarity. Like cable, this satellite programming 
isn't free. USSB's package will be $8-$35 a month, while DirecTv's range will 
be $22-$30. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the programming will be limited but representatives from both 
services insist it will be beefed up fairly quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The word around the convention was that in the next few years, this will be a 
real threat to the existing cable companies -- particularly if these systems 
are eventually marketed by many other companies in the $200-$400 range that's 
affordable to many people. Digital Format Woes 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much of a buzz about the digital formats introduced late in 1992, 
the digital compact cassette (DCC) and the MiniDisc, a tiny, recordable CD. In 
fact, retailers at the convention talked about cutting back on their stock of 
DCC and MD machines or dropping them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 These machines aren't selling well because they're expensive and don't offer 
sound comparable to what's produced by CD players. With the hardware not 
selling, prerecorded music on the formats has been limited.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the MD manufacturers aren't abandoning ship. Sansui, Clarion and 
Kenwood plan to enter the field with new MD machines this year, and two 
companies already manufacturing MD players, Sharp and Sanyo, both will 
introduce smaller, lighter portables this year -- Sharp's a compact 
player-recorder. And Sony, the MD market's major player, is stepping up its 
involvement, offering five new MD players. 
</P>
<P>
 The DCC bandwagon has no new boarders, however. What's New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Menace II Society" (Columbia TriStar, no set price): Grim, violent, sometimes 
brilliant melodrama set in Watts, focusing on the overwhelming hopelessness 
that grips young black men. Featuring talented unknowns such as Tyrin Turner, 
it's arguably the best drama about urban life ever made. What's astonishing is 
that it's the first film by a pair of 21-year-olds -- the Hughes twins, Allen 
and Albert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" (FoxVideo, no set price): Director/co-writer Mel 
Brooks' spoof of the Robin Hood movies, with Cary Elwes taking off on the Errol 
Flynn and Kevin Costner portrayals. Aims for zany, laugh-a-minute merriment but 
is mostly an endless stream of bad jokes. But there are a few sidesplitting 
moments, courtesy of Brooks playing Friar Tuck as a madcap rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heart and Souls" (MCA/Universal, no set price): Spirited ghost comedy about 
four dead bus-crash victims (Kyra Sedgewick, Charles Grodin, Alfre Woodward and 
Tom Sizemore) who invade the body of an uppity yuppie (Robert Downey Jr.) and 
direct him to settle outstanding details of their abruptly ended lives. Very 
amusing in spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bodies, Rest and Motion" (New Line, no set price): Nothing is more boring 
that watching boring people mull over their meaningless lives. Good cast, 
including Bridget Fonda and Eric Stoltz, stymied by stilted dialogue. Low-brow 
clone of "sex, lives and videotape." Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 Just announced: Warner is releasing "The Fugitive," the adventure starring 
Harrison Ford, on March 22, priced at $25. MCA/Universal's "Judgment Night," 
starring Emilio Estevez, comes out March 9. New Line's "Malice," with Alec 
Baldwin and Nicole Kidman, is due April 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Also: "Rookie of the Year," "Hard Target," "The Coneheads" and "Last Action 
Hero" (Jan. 26); "Poetic Justice" and "Kalifornia" (Feb. 2); "In the Line of 
Fire," "The Meteor Man," "Amongst Friends" and "That Night" (Feb. 9); "The 
Secret Garden" (Feb. 15); "Man Without a Face" (Feb. 16); "For Love or Money" 
and "Dazed and Confused" (Feb. 23); "Boxing Helena" (Feb. 24); "Much Ado About 
Nothing" and "Striking Distance" (March 2); "The Fox and the Hound" (March 4); 
"Manhattan Murder Mystery" and "So I Married an Axe Murderer" (March 9).

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: SOULFUL COLLECTIONS RECALL BEATLES SONGS, VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when you thought record companies had pretty much run out of ideas for CD 
retrospectives, Sony's Risky Business Records steps forward with a bright array 
of imaginative themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the series highlights: "Rubber Souled," which is versions of 13 Beatles 
songs by soul artists, and "Soul of Vietnam," which collects 12 songs that were 
released during the Vietnam War era. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than go for the biggest possible hits on each package, the production 
team at Risky Business often opts for those recordings that best fit the 
various concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we got the feeling, now," Al Green declares playfully at the start of 
what apparently was the final take of "I Want to Hold Your Hand," the 1972 
recording that opens the "Rubber Souled" collection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The simplicity of the teen-oriented hit makes it seem like an odd choice for 
Green, whose sensual and sophisticated singing style would seemingly be far 
more suited to more adult Lennon-McCartney numbers such as "Let It Be" and "Hey 
Jude." Yet Green brings such intensity to the tune that everything works out 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 As you listen to other tracks, including Arthur Conley's version of "Ob-La-Di, 
Ob-La-Da," you realize that the reason so many soul artists recorded Beatles 
songs in the '60s and early '70s was more a matter of good economics than 
simple affection for the material. 
</P>
<P>
 "The English had taken the meat off our bones," Memphis trumpet player Wayne 
Jackson says of the English rock invasion of the '60s in the album's liner 
notes. "We had to catch on to their coattails before it was too late. It was 
like, 'We've got to get a title on the new record that everybody knows.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the music on "Soul of Vietnam" will be new even to people who grew up 
in the era because they were neither pop nor major R&B hits at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Tex's "I Believe I'm Gonna Make It" is a tale of a soldier's hope that 
echoes the patriotic fervor of most World War II hits -- expressed in the form 
of a letter to a loved one. He tells how much strength he got from the last 
letter from home by saying, "I raised up (in his foxhole) and got me two more 
enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 But Roy C's "Open Letter to the President," a plea to stop the fighting, and 
the Mighty Hannibal's "Hymn 5," the tale of a soldier's anxiety, are darker 
expressions that are more typical of the pop mood associated with the times. 
</P>
<P>
 The album selections frequently reflect a wry sensibility that mirrors an 
obsessive pop collector's passions. Each package also comes with original 
artwork and liner notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other albums in the series: "Dangerous Women," a salute to female 
rockers that includes Babes in Toyland's "Catatonic" and Joan Jett's rendition 
of AC/DC's "Dirty Deeds"; "Songs of Peacemakers, Protesters and Potheads," 
whose odd mixture ranges from the Byrds' "He Was a Friend of Mine" to Country 
Joe and the Fish's "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag," and "Oh, Split!," which 
is subtitled "Great Break-Up Songs of the '60s" and includes Lou Christie's 
"Shake Hands and Walk Away Cryin' " and the Grass Roots' "Things I Should Have 
Said."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; COLUMBIA: '70S FEEL WITH AN '80S MENU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three older gentlemen whose wives are currently shopping -- in Paris -- are 
taking themselves out to the Pasadena Columbia Bar and Grill for dinner. "Isn't 
this a comfortable atmosphere?" says one, as they file into a booth. Through 
the window, trees in the patio twinkle with hundreds of little white lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very pleasant," says another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Civilized," says the third. Settled, they order gin drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 This new franchise of the popular Hollywood theater-district restaurant is 
located in the Tanner Marketplace in Old Pasadena, where Pappagallo once 
flourished. Indeed, the Columbia Bar and Grill caters to similar clientele: 
older, moneyed Pasadenans. On a Saturday afternoon, the patio is full of 
well-groomed women and their well-groomed daughters and their well-accessorized 
babies. Oh, there are a few businessmen, husbands accompanying their wives and 
a scattering of more casual people, like us, who haven't seen a manicurist in 
the last two weeks. On a Friday night, the crowd is sedate, a bit dressy. The 
younger, hipper set seems to be next door, at the Clearwater. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say the Columbia Bar and Grill is stuffy. It neatly fills the 
gap between Hamburger Hamlet and the Parkway Grill. Khaki shorts, on a warm 
day, outside on the patio, if you must. Among the tweed and gabardine, you'll 
see jeans -- with pressed dress shirts.  
</P>
<P>
 The decor is quietly retro, unaffected by the last decade of haute restaurant 
design. The color scheme is green and peachy-pink, the music easy-listening. 
The patio has comfortable chairs, heaters and a calming, noisome fountain. With 
walls of bricks, whitened wood and lots of potted plants, this new Columbia 
owes much to the more genteel fern bars of the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu, however, is straight from the '80s: a large, daunting pastiche of 
Asian, Italian, Cajun, Mexican and American dishes. Steamed Chinese chicken 
dumplings come with a sesame-ginger sauce that's salty, slightly greasy and 
actually pretty tasty. A quesadilla with shrimp and wild mushrooms is 
attractively presented but bland, and generally a dud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some dishes tend to be over-accessorized: An otherwise good smoked chicken 
salad, for example, doesn't really need that rock-hard, tasteless slab of 
papaya; a sauteed shrimp and scallop salad is inexplicably overwhelmed by 
pickled artichoke hearts.  
</P>
<P>
 Thinking that more traditional bar and grill food may be the way to finesse 
Columbia's appetizers, I try the shrimp cocktail (five tired soggy shrimp) and 
the crab cakes (deep-fried, crunchy and otherwise unremarkable). The Caesar 
salad puts me in a rhetorical stupor: Whence this gluey white Caesar dressing? 
I've been seeing it -- with displeasure -- on Caesars around town often 
coupled, as here, with a pulverized cheese that tastes precisely like sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Skip the paella, a saffron-infused mishmash of sausages, shellfish, lobster, 
chicken and peas and keep it simple with the entrees: The best ones are from 
the grill. Mixed seafood grill has an assortment of beautifully grilled fish -- 
salmon, swordfish, scallops, shrimp. Too bad the orzo , the rice-shaped pasta 
that can be such a wonderful textural pleasure, is way overcooked and swamped 
in a lemony herb sauce. Grilled free-range chicken is superb: succulent, hefty, 
also wonderfully cooked. No complaints about the lamb chops, either, in a 
mildly sweet mint glaze. These dinners come with nicely stir-fried wax beans, 
sugar snap peas, carrots and less-than-inspired potatoes -- the mashed are a 
little gluey, the O'Brien's little cubes of grease. 
</P>
<P>
 The dessert tray is most appetizing early in the evening, before the toffee 
mousse cake starts to slump. Still, it works at our table. We try chocolate 
crepes filled with white chocolate mousse in a pleasantly tart raspberry sauce. 
Creme brulee , "bruleed" earlier, is cool on top, but otherwise smooth and 
pleasurable. Poppyseed orange cake is dry and the frosting way too sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 The service is friendly and accommodating. On a slower night, the bus people, 
bored and looking for something to do, stop by a little too often in efforts to 
clear our dinner plates. But generally our little requests are humored 
cheerfully: There's less ice in the next drink, and a freshly brewed pot of 
decaf reveals that the coffee here is actually quite delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 * Columbia Bar and Grill Pasadena, 42 South Pasadena Ave., Pasadena, (818) 
578-0224. Open lunch through dinner 7 days. Full bar. Valet parking. Visa, 
MasterCard, American Express. Dinner for two, food only, $27-$58.

ART SHOW RISES FROM ASHES; EXHIBIT AT GALLERY IN TOPANGA CANYON IS INSPIRED BY 
NOVEMBER INFERNO AND HAS DRAWN UNUSUALLY HIGH COMMUNITY INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There is nothing like a disaster to foster a sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
 After the recent Malibu/Calabasasfires, four artist-members of the co-op New 
Canyon Gallery in Topanga felt a need to bring together the expressions of 
people who had experienced the maelstrom for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of organizing just an exhibit of work by gallery members, they opened 
the juried show to anyone in the greater community who wanted to submit work 
created in response to the November fires or any fire. Not without a sense of 
humor, they publicized the "Fires: A Community Art Show" as a "hot item" on 
bright orange flyers burned around the edges. 
</P>
<P>
 The show opens Saturday with a reception from 4 to 8 p.m. Music, storytelling 
and poetry will take place at the Cypress Cafe next door beginning at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery is filled with photography, painting, sculpture, mixed-media work 
and found objects burned or melted beyond recognition. Participants range from 
people who lost homes to individuals from such communities as Venice and 
Northridge who were not directly threatened by the fires. A few children and 
teen-agers also contributed work. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a forum for the community to find self-expression, to bear 
witness to one another's experience, to hopefully realize and participate in 
all kinds of different experiences. And if that's done communally, there will 
be some kind of healing that takes place," Jody Sibert said. She organized the 
show with Barbara King, Megan Rice and Nancy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculptor Burt Rashby carved his sweet-faced "Guardian Deity" out of wood. A 
divine vision of a helicopter, it is an homage to the firefighting helicopter 
pilots who saved his house in Fernwood as he stood there and watched. When he 
delivered the piece to the gallery, he told King that he already missed having 
it in his house and that he felt vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Lysaght, who has a woodworking shop in Topanga Canyon, expresses similar 
feelings in his wood carving "Safe." A firefighter carries a child away from 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
 On a lighter note, photographer Petrie Alexandra of Topanga has 
before-and-after pictures of a location on Saddle Peak. She had photographed a 
female model there before the fire. In some shots, a live chicken was included. 
After the fire, she brought the same model back to the spot. In these shots, 
the model holds a roasted chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Hadia Finley found the remains of some of her clay pieces in the rubble of her 
destroyed home in Fernwood. A half-blackened torso stands now on a new wood 
base. Along with that work and pieces from others are her photographs and 
journal entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Strote contributed the burned-up mailbox from her tenant's 
burned-down house in Calabasas. Mariah Woodruff, whose studio is in Topanga 
Canyon, found metal objects melted into intriguing abstract shapes. These 
include the small but powerful "Fire Dragon," which she mounted on a base. It 
came with a "fire opal eye." 
</P>
<P>
 The installation "She Lives" is the work of Mary, Eric and Devon Wright of 
Malibu. Eric, an architect and the grandson of Frank Lloyd Wright, lost all of 
his drawings in the fire. Devon, Mary and Eric's son, stayed on the property to 
try to save it. He also managed to take some photographs, which are on view. 
</P>
<P>
 The backdrop to "She Lives" is a large aluminum piece, what's left of their 
incinerated trailer. Included in the altar-like work are a pile of burned and 
rusted nails, and two pieces found in the rubble that the work commemorates: a 
small reproduction of an ancient Greek goddess figure and a small stone rune, 
the meaning of which is renewal. A patch of fresh sod will be watered during 
the run of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the found objects are the least predictable element in some 
ways," Sibert said. "We knew we would pull in a lot of photographs. This is not 
in any way to trivialize that medium. It's extremely powerful. But in some 
ways, (a found object) is one of the more raw expressions of the experience, 
especially when clearly it relates to someone who has suffered damage through 
the fires." 
</P>
<P>
 Sibert, who has made collages and a three-dimensional piece for the show, 
lives in Venice. She described herself as a "voyeur" during the fire. "I sat on 
the beach in Venice with my binoculars looking at the hills burning and I 
cried. However, I knew that it would be highly improbable for me to suffer 
direct damage. I'm not trivializing myself either as a voyeur or my expression 
of the fire, but there is an element that I feel is undeniably different 
between the objects brought in by people who have suffered and pictures taken 
by the voyeurs." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to let people actually feel what it was like to be here and get 
people talking," said King, a Fernwood resident. She and her husband, Scott, 
remained at their home during the fire. "The more I talk about it, the better I 
feel." 
</P>
<P>
 When firefighters pulled onto their dead-end street late at night, they asked 
the Kings to leave. "We said, 'We're not leaving,' " King said. "They sized us 
up to see what sort of crazies had stuck around, and then they parked Engine 48 
in our driveway for four days. They gave us jackets and helmets and gloves. 
When the fire was right there, they put me on the roof and told me to look for 
embers down along our property. The wind was such that all the embers just went 
up and away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared after, but during it, it was just happening. We'd go in and 
watch the TV and get all freaked out. They got all the names all mixed up and 
they had streets going into streets that didn't even exist, and it just looked 
like such a mess. And we said, 'Well, let's go out and look at the fire and see 
what's going on.' We'd go out and look and say, 'OK, I can deal with this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 King teaches ceramics at Rustic Canyon Arts and Crafts Center in Santa Monica 
Canyon. After showing a class a video of a new technique, she was "just sort of 
doodling with the technique and I did this piece -- I didn't even think about 
it -- it was of a person running, and it looked like it had already been 
through the fire," she said. "I glazed it black, and that's one of the things I 
want to put in the show because I realized now I was running away from the 
fire." 
</P>
<P>
 In another work, King has framed an oil pastel drawing of the fire with sumac 
wood that burned on her hill. The frame's glass looks as if it's melted. 
</P>
<P>
 It was King who asked Williams, a Rustic Canyon Arts and Crafts Center 
student, to join her in planning the show. Williams, who paints under her 
maiden name Swenson, contributed watercolors of Santa Monica Bay and Tuna 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice was not at her Topanga home when the fire started and was not allowed 
back in the area. "My daughter was taken by bus from the school to the Valley 
and I stayed at my in-laws for three days and watched the television," she 
said. "I wrote a stream-of-consciousness thing one of the days of the fire, and 
I started a woodcut, a triptych." Both works will be on view. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice said she is delighted by the "numbers of people who are excited" by the 
show. "Usually when we have shows here, you have to beg people to come. So much 
effort goes into bringing people in. This feels different. So many of these 
people, we didn't even know they were doing any work." Where and When

A TRIM OF THE BARD; 'TWIN PEAKS' ALUM WENDY ROBIE DIRECTS AND STARS IN HOURLONG 
VERSIONS OF 'TWELFTH NIGHT' AND 'MACBETH.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Who's crazier? a) The housewife trying to find the world's quietest runners 
for her living room curtains, or b) the actor-director who is editing two 
Shakespeare plays, "Twelfth Night" and "Macbeth," down to one hour each. 
</P>
<P>
 You might have your own answer, but Wendy Robie would probably demur, since 
she has intimate knowledge of both cases. In the first, she played the 
housewife -- the eye-patch-wearing Nadine on David Lynch's "Twin Peaks." In the 
second, she's the daredevil editor, squeezing the contrasting pair of classics 
into the simply titled "An Evening of Shakespeare," opening tonight at the 
Whitefire Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 When Robie, who's in her 30s, sits down in the Whitefire space and considers 
whether what she's doing is foolhardy, she valiantly makes a case for the 
negative: "I admit this is an audacious thing to do, but I've played and taught 
Shakespeare's characters, so I know them very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, far more outlandish projects to reduce, reuse and recycle Shakespeare 
have flourished for many years. The Reduced Shakespeare Company first made its 
L.A., then its international, name with a manic act that included every play by 
the Bard -- even if just a line from each. 
</P>
<P>
 And this writer remembers a notorious 1989 East German production of "Hamlet" 
in which playwright-adapter Heiner Muller turned the tragedy into silent-film 
farce and dropped all but a dozen lines from the original text. 
</P>
<P>
 Robie's motives are far less subversive. In fact, they're downright inviting. 
Her intent with this project, she says, is to introduce audience members to the 
works and offer a chance to those who know the texts to play What Lines Were 
Cut? 
</P>
<P>
 "You always see those people in the audience who bring along their copies of 
the play," Robie says, "and try to spot cuts. This time, they should have a 
field day." 
</P>
<P>
 It might not be easy for those text hunters to track Robie's editing, because 
she insists that this is no literary clear-cutting. Think of it as, in Robie's 
phrase, "clipping" both the "Macbeth" plot -- in which the misguided hero sinks 
into a bloody morass of revenge and maneuvering for control of Scotland -- and 
the "Twelfth Night" plot -- in which shipwrecked siblings Viola and Sebastian 
find themselves on the island of Illyria, home to a society overrun with 
foolishness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our effort is to tell the stories clearly," she says. "It's just that I'm 
choosing the stories to focus on. In the case of 'Twelfth Night,' it's Viola's 
relationships to Orsino (Duke of Illyria) and Olivia (the Illyrian countess), 
as well as Sebastian's relationship to Olivia. I want to tell the story of a 
leisurely colonial island people with far too much time on their hands, who get 
taught a lesson by the shipwrecked visitors." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Robie's Illyria is a Caribbean isle in the 1930s, modeled after the 
carefree spirit of the 1933 Dolores Del Rio musical "Flying Down to Rio." 
</P>
<P>
 Robie's "Macbeth," though, is still the "Macbeth" of 11th-Century Scotland, 
with the pivotal marriage-in-blood of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth as its 
centerpiece. Finding just the right verb to term her adaptation, Robie says, "I 
axed the Thanes. Most people have a hard time telling apart Menteith from Angus 
from Caithness from Lennox, so it's been reduced down to the character of Ross. 
A lot in Macduff's speeches is cut, as well. It's also important to remember 
that Shakespeare gives one clues where to cut, when information is repeated in 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Robie has assembled an eight-member cast, including herself (playing 
Viola and Lady Macbeth), co-director Tony Carreiro (playing Orsino and Macbeth) 
and Whitefire owner-operator Dan Hirsch (in a number of smaller roles), this 
"Evening" actually began as a two-actress show in Robie's former artistic home, 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a bit reluctant to admit to that show's title -- "A Coupla Shakespearean 
Chicks Standing Up and Talking" -- but its essence, as a vehicle to do 
Shakespeare scenes for and by women, became "Redheads Do Shakespeare Standing 
Up," which Robie performed with current cast member Andrea Goyan during the 
1993 NoHo Performing Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's because Wendy and I are both from Seattle theater and love 
Shakespeare," says Carreiro, who teaches stage fighting when he isn't acting, 
"but we talk alike. It became clear during rehearsals that it was better for me 
to direct some scenes, especially those involving fighting. Actors often forget 
that they're still acting while they're fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 What lured Robie from the land of rain to the land of rays was Lynch, who saw 
her work at Seattle's Bellevue Repertory and asked her to read for something 
then titled "Northwest Passage." 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to the audition wearing a shawl, thinking it was a Western," she says. 
It wasn't quite the Western Robie assumed, but the far, far-out Lynchian 
Western of "Twin Peaks." Robie's Nadine proved to be a durable character on the 
surreal soap, and even lasted into the film sequel, "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With 
Me," though not in the U. S. print. ("You can find Nadine," Robie says 
amusedly, "on the European and Japanese laser disc versions, as the really 
hard-core fans probably already know.") 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, she insists, "is the last place I expected to end up as an actor, 
because I'm not drop-dead gorgeous and I'm very stage-oriented -- and you can't 
make a living acting in L.A. theater. But I guess I'm proof that you can go 
from Shakespeare to television and back to Shakespeare again and actually 
survive." Where and When

THEATER REVIEW; READ IT AND WEEP; 'JANE'S JOURNAL,' WHICH TRIES TO DEAL WITH 
WOMEN'S ISSUES -- FREEDOM OF CHOICE, INDEPENDENCE AND SINGLE MOTHERHOOD -- 
TRIES ONE'S PATIENCE.

<P>
 How's this for a contemporary theatrical premise? A young woman, an expatriate 
American film critic living in sexually liberated 1970s London, precariously 
maintains two lovers who are unaware of each other until she becomes pregnant 
and is compelled to level with her sweethearts about her double life. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters is the multiple life choices faced by this free-spirited, 
devil-may-care woman, who has absolutely no clue which of her lovers is the 
father-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor soul -- at least she has a glamorous job (which she takes for granted) 
and can mercifully narrow the actual dad down to two. Since one of them is 
black and the other white, all will be clear in good time. 
</P>
<P>
 Now let's be fair. True, "Jane's Journal," in its premiere staging at the 
Limelight Playhouse in North Hollywood, is meant to be essentially a comedy 
that doesn't take itself too seriously until its preachy, humble ending. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's hard to feel empathy for the heroine, the expressive, raven-haired 
Merry Shaman, who constantly plays it over the top. Fortunately, the men in her 
life -- Brian I. Lester's sensitive burglar and Clyde Talley II's black 
Oxfordian lawyer -- are affable, sympathetic characters. Contributing needed 
vibrancy is Jane's devoted girlfriend (Susan Reno) -- another movie critic. 
Talk about a play understating careers, these women never even discuss movies, 
the arts or remotely suggest critics.  
</P>
<P>
 What you feel is impatience with a play that wants to connect with women's 
issues -- primarily freedom of choice, independence and single motherhood -- 
but that is neither universal nor faintly that handy, all-purpose, intended 
hyphenate, comedy-drama. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of this smug little four-character adventure is a 
self-congratulatory tone that seems, from a '90s perspective, fundamentally 
dated. Given that the title role is performed by the playwright herself (who 
adapted the 1974 novel "Jane" by Dee Wells), it's probable that director Kevin 
Shaw was either overly permissive or that Shaman the actress could not step 
sufficiently back from her script and control her frequently loud delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 What kills the play finally is that Shaman has an air of enjoying her 
performance too much. That's confounded by the play's fragile structure, in 
which Shaman's iconoclast is recording her life story on a tape machine and 
slipping into dramatic flashback. Such a device can be artful, but here it 
demands that she address the audience directly, and her monologues, rather than 
being heart-felt or brushed with easy, self-mocking charm, are delivered 
self-consciously. 
</P>
<P>
 On the technical side, values are sharp, notably Kurt Gill's lighting design, 
the smoothly workable, non-credited apartment design and interludes of Beatles 
music. Where and When

NEW AND IMPROV; DOUG COX AND JOHN MOODY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR 
GROUNDLINGS DAYS IN 'WHICH END'S UP?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If you like the Groundlings, you might want to check out what some of their 
alumni are up to. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a Groundlings revue, except that there are just two of us," says 
Doug Cox, co-author and co-star -- with John Moody -- of "Which End's Up?," 
opening Jan. 21 at Lionstar Theatre (formerly Company of CharActors theater). 
</P>
<P>
 "John and I were in the Groundlings for a combined 25 years, so you'll see a 
lot of that influence," Cox said. Two of their popular Groundlings characters, 
Skip and Duffy, will be on hand, in a comedy roster that includes improv, 
audience participation and set sketches, some performed with interactive 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 "One piece we do with the video is 'News Now,' a spoof of Channel 4 News, 
recapping the same stories all the time," Cox said. Also on tape are "Meet the 
Nation," satirizing the Sunday morning political-pundit shows (Cox refers to 
his on-air role as "some hack from the Clinton Administration") and "Phone 'n' 
Fish," a commercial for an all-in-one cellular phone and fish rod. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're flying with an improv, it's so exciting," says Maryland native 
Moody, who teaches a weekly improv class in Hollywood. "There's the element of 
danger. You're walking the wire, starting to fall, trying to right yourself. 
It's always possible you'll reach that nirvana." 
</P>
<P>
 Moody says he does not consider himself one of the chosen few. "I really feel 
most people can do improv. You've just got to work at it, prepare yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair met when Moody joined the Groundlings in 1980; as a writing team, 
their work includes a screenplay (the "Dirty Harry" satire "No Smoking," which 
was bought by New World and is currently, Cox notes, "in development 
oblivion"), comedy material for Cassandra (Elvira) Peterson, and four episodes 
of "Pee-wee's Playhouse," for which they received two Emmy nominations. On his 
own, Moody penned the 1992 stage comedy "Cable Guys," which played at Burbank's 
Third Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither performer came to Hollywood with the intention of acting. 
Illinois-born Cox is a 1978 graduate of USC Film School. It was a college 
classmate who introduced him to the Groundlings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started hanging out there, taking classes," Cox recalls. "It was so 
exciting being in front of an audience every week -- not inhibiting at all. The 
whole thing was 'Let's go out there and make this work.' His 1989 departure 
from the group came with no hard feelings; he still occasionally performs there 
on Alumni Night. "You get burned out, want to do something different. So I went 
to Oxford for a year, studying Shakespeare and Chekhov -- just learning for the 
fun of it. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Moody majored in political science -- and, he says, "being a hippie, 
protesting the Vietnam War" -- at the University of Maryland, before detouring 
to Aspen for a few years, arriving in Los Angeles in 1976. After three years 
working in the clothing business, Moody came upon the Groundlings, promptly 
quit his job and started taking classes at the theater. "When I first saw them, 
I thought, 'This is what I want to do with the rest of my life,' " he says 
earnestly. "It looked like more fun than I'd ever seen before. It was so free 
." Where and When

REVIVING THE ERA OF COLTRANE; THE SOMA QUARTET'S SOUND IS 'SERIOUS CONTEMPORARY 
IMPROVISATION' INSPIRED BY '60S JAZZ GIANTS. THE GROUP ALSO DOESN'T SHY FROM 
HAVING ITS WAY WITH POP STANDARDS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Cook was just 15, standing in his bedroom in his parents' home in Garden 
Grove, when his musical world was turned upside-down. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling drummer was listening to the album that one music critic called 
"the most powerful human sound ever recorded." That album was John Coltrane's 
"Ascension," an expressive, free jazz-leaning 1965 recording that featured such 
notables as saxophonists Archie Shepp and Pharoah Sanders, trumpeter Freddie 
Hubbard and drummer Elvin Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really taken aback," recalled Cook, who had been mostly listening to 
the relatively tame sounds of Duke Ellington and Count Basie. "It was very raw 
and forceful. I had to read the liner notes to understand that was what 
Coltrane called a 'spontaneous composition.' 'Ascension' has had an impact on 
my direction as a musician." 
</P>
<P>
 Coltrane's music had a similar effect on guitarist Chuck Jennings. He was 19, 
rooming with a classical guitarist named Stuart Cary in Richmond, Va., when 
Cary played an album with Coltrane's 1960 classic, "My Favorite Things." The 
saxophonist's lilting, expansive 13-minute version of the Rodgers and 
Hammerstein classic deeply touched Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the music that I had always wanted to hear," Jennings, 36, said. "I 
was playing pop at the time, not jazz, and that album inspired me to play 
jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz of the '60s, as typified by these recordings by Coltrane and the renowned 
Miles Davis quintet that featured Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter and 
Tony Williams, underpins the music that Cook and Jennings play today in their 
Soma Quartet, which Cook calls "a serious contemporary improvisational jazz 
ensemble." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're attracted to the developments in jazz from that era," said Cook, 43, in 
a phone interview from his Garden Grove home. The group, which also will 
spotlight saxophonist Andy Suzuki and bassist King Dahl, performs Thursday at 
Jax in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's repertoire includes a broad range of material from tunes that can 
become completely spontaneous to such pop standards as "There Is No Greater 
Love" and less-often heard compositions of the '60s and '70s, such as Shorter's 
"Infant Eyes" and Ornette Coleman's "Law Years." At Jax, the band tends to pull 
in the reins and eschew tunes that are free form and without structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play at Jax with a different concept, though that doesn't mean we limit 
ourselves," Cook said. "Tunes like 'Infant Eyes' allow you to play from within 
yourself, to play something beautiful, because that's what we feel from this 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 A group that relishes spontaneous improvisation doesn't usually select 
standards to perform, but Cook finds no problem with that course of action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Standards are a different shade of what we feel," he said. "You could dissect 
a tune like 'No Greater Love,' rearrange its elements, make it a 'free' 
interpretation, but if you align yourself with the sentiments of the song, like 
thinking about the lyrics, there's enough there to express yourself with." 
</P>
<P>
 Group interaction is important to a Soma performance. "Our music is just as 
much inspired by what the bass player and drummer are playing, as what you hear 
from the soloist," Jennings said in a conversation from his Silver Lake home. 
</P>
<P>
 Consistency marks the band's performances, says Jax's general manager, Gary 
Watanabe. "They're very tight and the players blend in well." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook and Jennings met in 1990 at a jam session at the Iguana Cafe in North 
Hollywood and had an immediate fondness for each other's playing. That 
affection remains. "Chuck's a fiery player. He has a strong desire to further 
himself as a musician," Cook said. "Alan's always making a contribution," 
Jennings said. "He's very responsive." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, who cites Williams as a primary influence, began playing drums as a 
preteen. "I tore the cardboard rollers out of hangers and used them as 
drumsticks, banging on anything I could," he said. Later he got a drum set and 
pretty much taught himself to play. He worked with several Southern California 
rock and jazz bands before forming Soma. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings, a 1981 graduate of the Berklee College of Music in Boston, has also 
had a variety of experiences, from playing in a band that performed Nigerian 
"highlife" music to blues bands. "I like it all. I just like to improvise, no 
matter the setting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soma doesn't work a lot, and that bothers Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 He wonders about the band's future. "We're in a quandary," he said. "We have 
to decide whether we're going to make a recording and try to get work out of 
town, perhaps go to Europe, but that remains to be seen. Club owners like to 
bring in 'name' acts, and to be a developing band trying to stay alive in 
smaller clubs, that's a hard row to hoe." Where and When

PLAYING AGAINST HER TYPE; MARION ROSS, KNOWN FOR HER ROLE AS THE WHOLESOME MOM 
ON 'HAPPY DAYS,' IS HAPPY TO STAR AS AN IMPASSIONED WOMAN FALLING APART IN 
'LOVE LETTERS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of her stage and television career, Marion Ross has portrayed 
wholesome, uplifting characters, epitomized by more than a decade as Mrs. C on 
"Happy Days." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross is always eager to rebel against her snow-white image. This weekend, 
she'll get another chance in A. R. Gurney's "Love Letters" at Pierce College in 
Woodland Hills. The piece traces years of correspondence between two lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this role because a woman disintegrates," Ross said. "I'm so uphill 
all the time that I love to play someone going downhill." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, a Woodland Hills resident, also appreciates the opportunity to help a 
school in her neighborhood. Proceeds from the shows will be used to send the 
school's Premiere Chorale to a conference in Sacramento. The chorale, founded 
in 1977, plays classical music, opera and jazz. Ross narrated its recent 
Christmas program. 
</P>
<P>
 For this year, she has no plans to appear in a television series. She's still 
fuming from the disappointment of "Brooklyn Bridge," a show that received 
plenty of accolades from the press but was canceled due to poor ratings. She 
played Sophie Berger, the family's matriarch. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people didn't like 'Brooklyn Bridge,' what will they like?" she asked. "We 
were all really burned by it." 
</P>
<P>
 This marks her third appearance in "Love Letters." She and her co-star, Paul 
Michael, a veteran of 14 Broadway shows, performed the play together last 
spring in Massachusetts and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love Letters," starring Marion Ross and Paul Michael, will be performed at 8 
p.m. Saturday and 3 p.m. Sunday at Pierce College, 6201 Winnetka Ave., Woodland 
Hills. Tickets are $10 general admission, $8 students and seniors. A reception 
to be held after Saturday's performance is $5 general admission, $2 for 
students and seniors. Call (818) 753-3306.

 DIAL DOWNEY -- Go ahead, touch that dial, but, here's a warning: 
</P>
<P>
 Morton Downey Jr. is back. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the first outrageous disc jockey/talk-show host to generate national 
controversy in the 1980s -- sorry Rush and Howard -- has resurfaced on Los 
Angeles airwaves. Since late last month, KIEV-AM (870) in Glendale has been 
carrying his Chicago-based weekday talk show live from 2 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be too early for ratings, but not for rave reviews from station 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a great reaction so far," insisted KIEV President Ron Beaton. 
"The more you listen, the more you like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Downey, 51, says he has transformed into a kinder and gentler version of the 
guy who offended practically every racial and ethnic group during the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't be as nasty anymore," Downey said in a phone interview. "The times 
won't tolerate it. I've learned how to take out that element." 
</P>
<P>
 What he won't change, however, is his self-proclaimed role as a watchdog 
monitoring corrupt and inefficient Washington politicians. He said Clinton, 
though well-meaning and respectable, is overwhelmed by the task of governing a 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's absolutely inept," Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey started his new national radio show six weeks ago, and will soon be 
heard on about 125 stations. Most shows feature guests, although the bulk of 
the program is devoted to exchanges between Downey and his audience. He also 
hosts a television show, which reaches 44 markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaton said he plans eventually to broadcast two hours of Downey's three-hour 
program. Currently, KIEV carries only the first hour. He agrees that Downey has 
toned down his act from a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he's still controversial," Beaton said. 
</P>
<P>
 SPOTLIGHT ON VALLEY -- Can the Valley top its impressive performance of 1993, 
when three high school students captured $5,000 each as winners in the Los 
Angeles Music Center's Spotlight Awards? It certainly won't be easy -- there 
are only six categories -- but the quest has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition to select the finalists in the events -- opera, modern dance, 
classical instrumental, jazz instrumental, pop vocal and ballet -- started last 
weekend, and will continue through mid-February. Of the remaining 75 
performers, 10 attend Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In each category, about a dozen teen-agers from throughout Southern California 
will perform before judges. The top two students will proceed to the finals, 
scheduled for March 29 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by the Pacific Telesis Foundation, the Spotlight Awards select winners 
from more than 600 applicants, ages 14 to 18, who audition in November and 
December. Winners in each field receive $5,000; runners-up get $2,500.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: TRADE POLICY; MEMBERS OF FREE FOR ALL SWAP SERVICES, FROM 
BABY-SITTING TO TEETH-CLEANING TO MEMORY TRAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Trading skills -- instead of paying cash -- is one way to save big money. Name 
a service, and a member of the bartering service Free for All probably can 
provide it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bartering services come and go, but Free for All has been around for 
almost 20 years. It offers everything from teeth-cleaning, dog-walking, 
baby-sitting, tutoring or translation to private investigation, piano lessons, 
photo-tinting, songwriting, typing, memory training or computer instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 This system differs significantly from conventional bartering because members 
freely share services -- they don't have to balance out what they use against 
what they give. Members enjoy as many listed services as they want, without 
limit, but are encouraged to put in as much as they take out. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Richard Johnson started the organization in 1975 as a 
special-interest group within MENSA, the society for people with high IQs, but 
after two years set up shop independently. Membership, which has vacillated 
between 100 and 350 over the years, stands at 175 participants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get our members largely by word of mouth. Free for All makes very little 
profit; I mainly offer it as a service to the community," Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-time registration fee, which covers all adults in a household, is $54. 
Annual dues are $44. The registration form asks for the specific number of 
hours that can be worked, which can be changed, during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Six-year member Lily Vickson of Santa Monica, who lists child care as her 
primary service, signed up for six hours a week. "I keep track of my hours, and 
at the end of the year, I turn in a list of members I have provided child care 
for, along with the services I have used," Vickson says.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Vickson received about $250 worth of services. "I've belonged to 
other groups where they worked with bartering dollars and always came out on 
the short end of the stick," Vickson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Strickler of Sylmar offers driving as a service. "I'm not overwhelmed 
with requests . . . maybe once a month or so. But I've used a dental service, 
have had a psychic reading and instruction on how to work my VCR." 
</P>
<P>
 Free for All services are outlined in an indexed and cross-referenced 17-page 
Freedom Directory that lists members and services, with addresses and phone 
numbers. Updates are issued every three months, and an accompanying newsletter 
lists social gatherings and special offers for members. A "no-risk guarantee" 
promises a full refund. The list of services provided by members exceeds 250, 
and the latest service update added 12 new categories. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose I might use a variety of them during the year, but if all I get for 
my $98 is computer instruction, it's already a bargain. Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: Free for All bartering service.

LITTLE LIVING SCULPTURES; CARING FOR BONSAI TREES IS A SOLITARY TASK THAT 
REQUIRES TIME AND PATIENCE. BUT FOR KNOWLEDGE AND INSPIRATION, BEGINNERS AND 
EXPERIENCED GROWERS TURN TO A NURSERY IN SYLMAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

gardening for The Times.

<P>
 Two Saturday mornings a month, a parade of trucks, vans and station wagons 
arrives at Fuji Bonsai Nursery in Sylmar. There's a ceremonial flourish to the 
way the drivers, ordinary folk in jeans and zip jackets, slide doors open and 
lift their cargo out: tiny potted trees and miniature groves that fairy 
children could get lost in. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from magic, though, these greens have been chopped, clipped, wired and 
otherwise coaxed into the size and shape of living sculptures. In their 
minimalist simplicity, they are meant to conjure up imagined scenes from 
nature, complete with an implied context of seasons, winds, colonies of plants 
and heaps of rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Their creators, most of them regulars who attend Fuji's bonsai classes with 
the air of churchgoing parishioners, may spend several private hours a day at 
work on their own collections. 
</P>
<P>
 But after long periods of solitary wiring and trimming, they might get stuck 
or need input, or just want to talk bonsai. That's when they go to Fuji. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sees things I don't see," said Morris Dondick, a Northridge hobbyist who 
recently stood back from a worktable as nursery owner Shigeru Nagatoshi helped 
him anchor his Japanese garden juniper to a piece of stone. "I come here when I 
hit a snag, and because it's good for the soul. A gentle art attracts gentle 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of Dondick's fellow regulars -- among them Walter O'Neal, a San 
Fernando television executive; Ted McKnelly, a La Canada psychologist, and 
Dwain Petersen, a retired salesman from Northridge -- suggests that an exacting 
discipline also attracts dedicated practitioners. Most of them have been honing 
their craft for years and are active members of local bonsai societies. Their 
personal collections range from 40 to several hundred plants, and their class 
projects may already have won them ribbons at bonsai competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 But beginners are also welcome at Fuji. For a standard $7.50 fee, they receive 
as much attention as the veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mentors have plenty of experience. Nagatoshi learned bonsai more than 30 
years ago from a Japanese master, and his two sons, Ray, who has lectured 
throughout the world on bonsai, and Tom, learned the art from him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray outlined the basic steps he likes to cover with first-timers: "First, we 
show them how to select appropriate material for bonsai, then how to treat it, 
wire it, trim it, reduce its root system so it can go in a proper pot and, 
finally, how to keep it alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who don't own the proper tools for the job can buy them during class. 
(A basic five-piece set starts at $78.) 
</P>
<P>
 Students may also bring their own plants (juniper is recommended for 
beginners) or buy one at the nursery, which sells an impressive array of 
appropriate greens, starting at $15. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, visitors may stroll around the 3/4-acre grounds to view wonders 
of the art, including pint-size black pines, Atlas cedars and sweet gum groves, 
some considerably older than the 28-year-old nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all these collector's specimens are for sale and, even when they are, 
prices are a closely guarded secret because of security considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the worktables, it's easy to see why bonsai is regarded by some as a 
priceless art. Each slice of the clippers, each twist of the wire, is a 
carefully considered act. A simple pruning job might take hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I arrived this morning," O'Neal said, "my Foemina (juniper) looked like 
a big puff ball. I've been restyling it, running my hand along the trunk, 
looking for the flow, the balance. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours into the task, his little tree had assumed the shape of a windblown 
sentinel, possibly overlooking a crashing sea. 
</P>
<P>
 So was he finished? 
</P>
<P>
 He had to smile. "I'll be working on this for the rest of my life." Where and 
When 
</P>
<P>
 What: Bonsai classes.

BEAUTY OF DRUGSTORE MAKEUP; IN LEAN ECONOMIC TIMES, MANY WOMEN ARE 
REDISCOVERING THE SHOPS' COSMETICS FOR PRICE AND CONVENIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Women who never thought that they could part with their Chanel makeup in the 
show-off '80s are rediscovering drugstore cosmetics in the frugal '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of shopping at drugstores means more than just paying less for 
makeup. Many women appreciate the in-and-out convenience of a drugstore, where 
they can also pick up pharmaceuticals, school supplies and often take advantage 
of free delivery. And for those who still prefer department store makeup, many 
brands are available at the area drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of noteworthy local pharmacies and their beauty wares: 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Drug in Burbank is as much a gift emporium as it is a pharmacy. The 
cosmetic counter spans the entire right wall. Several men's fragrances are 
sold, including many by Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Estee Lauder. Fendi, 
Chloe, Fracas and scents by Lauder and Liz Claiborne are a few of the women's 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 Prestigious cosmetic lines grace the long counter, including Lauder's. Also 
stocked are Clinique, Ultima II, Borghese, Christian Dior and Elizabeth Arden. 
Revlon and Max Factor are among the less expensive, mass-marketed lines, sold 
near the main counter. Testers are available from the salesclerk for most of 
the products. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several complete bath-product lines, including a handful of unusual 
names. Neutrogena, Jean Nate, Caswell-Massey and Perlier's honey-scented 
products are familiar enough. But products by Kneipp, Aromatique and The Thymes 
Limited -- more often seen in department stores or fancy bath shops -- lend 
exclusivity to the selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone picky about their shampoo will appreciate the extensive stock of Rene 
Furterer, Sebastian and Paul Mitchell products. The store also offers scads of 
manicure tools and supplies, as well as a number of elegant cosmetic travel 
cases. Free delivery is available with a $5 minimum purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 317 N. Pass Ave., Burbank, (818) 766-9555.  
</P>
<P>
 Valley Clarins users don't have to fight for mall parking to replenish their 
supplies. At Northridge Pharmacy, the entire line is available for free 
delivery, as are several others often seen in department stores. Among them: 
Guerlain, Germaine Monteil, Elizabeth Arden and Christian Dior (only the 
lipstick, nail polish and mascara are available here). Revlon, Almay and Cover 
Girl color cosmetics are also in stock, as are the popular Alpha Hydrox skin 
care products. 
</P>
<P>
 There are fragrances for women by Givenchy, Paloma Picasso and Calvin Klein, 
among others. Men can choose from a selection by Yves St. Laurent, Ralph Lauren 
and Dior. Several bath lines, including those by Jean Nate, Crabtree & Evelyn, 
and Natura are in ample supply. The store also has a display of "mix-your-own 
nail polish" kits. 
</P>
<P>
 9167 Reseda Blvd., Northridge, (818) 349-7000.  
</P>
<P>
 An in-store beauty salon is housed inside Marks Valley Drugs in Sherman Oaks. 
Several prestigious hair care lines, including Paul Mitchell, Sebastian, 
Mastey, Pantene and KMS, are displayed in front of the utilitarian salon near 
the store's cosmetic area. Mass-marketed cosmetic brands such as Revlon, Almay 
and Max Factor are sold, as are such tonier brands as Orlane, Dermablend and 
Yuth, a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free line of color cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 There are scores of scents for men -- Bijan, Lagerfeld and others by Calvin 
Klein, Ralph Lauren and Chanel, to name a few. Women can choose from L'Air du 
Temps, White Shoulders, Chloe and others by Christian Dior, Estee Lauder, Yves 
St. Laurent and Liz Claiborne. Delivery is free with a $10 minimum purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 4556 Van Nuys Blvd., Sherman Oaks, (818) 788-5531.  
</P>
<P>
 PayLess Drug may lack the atmosphere of an old-time drugstore, but the service 
is the same, if not improved. Free home delivery is available in some areas, 
and catalogues are offered for easier home ordering. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the new Palmdale store, the cosmetic area is a major focal point. Every 
conceivable mass-market line is carried, including several play makeup sets for 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
 PayLess also stocks a variety of scents engineered to mimic such famous 
fragrances as Escape, Red, Obsession and others. Vertical shelves arranged 
around a central counter often are staffed or, at the least, carefully 
monitored. About half the cosmetics sold are available for sampling, but the 
goods are kept behind the counter to avoid contamination by random passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers are invited to sign up on the store's preferred customer mailing 
list. Free samples and other goodies are sent to those on the list, and their 
favorite products are kept on file for handy reference.

COLLISION OF SHAPES AND COLORS; THE HIGH-TECH MASINO BUILDING IN SUN VALLEY 
BRIGHTENS AN OTHERWISE DRAB INDUSTRIAL NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN VAUGHN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Susan Vaughn writes regularly about 
design for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Masino Office Building is a solitary bloom in this area's industrial 
badlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid corrugated sheds, cinder-block garages and plywood shacks it stands. 
Angles jut, colors pop, plate-steel letters blaze. If the 21st-Century Jetson 
family needed office space, it would fly its Jetmobile to this unique little 
building on Tuxford Street. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley architects Jerry Sherman and Mike Ball created the 
high-tech one-story office-warehouse complex for Michael Masino, president of 
Masino Plastering Inc., in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to break up the monotony of the area and reflect Michael's line of 
work -- plastering," Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using Masino's trademark color (turquoise) and his contracting products 
(plaster, lots of it), Sherman and Ball designed a 6,000-square-foot fantasy 
work space amid a desert of industrial banalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building's different," said Masino, grinning. "It's unusual. But we love 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1987 to 1989, Masino had toiled in a trailer on the grounds, behind a 
dilapidated 800-square-foot cottage built in 1923. The cottage was too decrepit 
to occupy; Masino's trailer was cramped at best. Exasperated, Masino called 
Sherman and Ball for architectural relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left the details up to them," he recalled. "I had worked with them on other 
projects, so I knew their work. I just told them I wanted something different. 
And they went to town." 
</P>
<P>
 Masino Office Building's exterior is, of course, plaster. But it's not the 
"yucko-stucco" blight that afflicts much of America's urban landscape. The 
building's sweeping angles, asymmetry and subtle sci-fi colors give it 
21st-Century appeal -- and timeless dynamic tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks more complicated than it really is," Ball said. "We worked with a 
boxlike shape to create a very un-boxy environment. It had to be on scale with 
neighboring buildings, but it needed its own unique identity, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The entrance is turquoise, highlighted in black. "MASINO OFFICE BUILDING" 
pulses in plate-steel lettering above a thick maroon I-beam. A western parapet 
wall beside the walkway is cool gray; the eastern wall is a darker and warmer 
shade of gray. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside are more colliding shapes and hues: diagonals, curves, arcing contours, 
chiaroscuro. Sherman and Ball divided the boxy interior into complex units, 
using a space-age vocabulary of fragmented geometrics, superimposed planes and 
repeating curves. 
</P>
<P>
 The reception area consists of a bird's-eye maple wedge, illuminated by 
stalactite-like canisters. Ferrari-red chairs and a 1940s-style Coca Cola 
fridge challenge the office's motif of turquoise, black, gray and white. 
</P>
<P>
 Masino's office, to the left of the entrance, is high-tech and oblong. It 
repeats the turquoise/black/gray motif in its porcelain-tile floor, sleek 
walls, grid-work ceiling and custom-made coffee table wrought by Sherman and 
Ball from Masino's scaffolding.  
</P>
<P>
 Behind the office complex is a more sedate "Center Shop," where Masino's 
inventory -- predominantly sheet metal and plastering materials -- is stored. 
Nearby is the "Repair Shop," where Masino's tools, equipment and fleet of 
flatbed trucks are occasionally nursed back to health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really proud of this office, and I wish more of my customers could see 
it," Masino said. "I guess the irony is, in my business, I mostly travel to my 
clients' sites. I've got this great-looking place, and not too many people get 
to see it." Where to Go 
</P>
<P>
 What: Masino Office Building. 
</P>

 You wouldn't guess from the tranquil surroundings that this beautiful property 
just off Mulholland Highway is something of a battle site. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka University, which owns the land, is fending off an attempt by the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy to buy 245 of the school's 660 acres for a park 
visitors' center. Now a language school, Soka wants to expand into a small 
liberal arts college. In the meantime, regardless of the bureaucratic 
grappling, nature lovers can enjoy the area on Soka-sponsored environmental 
walks. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, which is headquartered in Japan, is at 26800 W. Mulholland Hwy., 
just east of the intersection at Las Virgenes Road. Environmental walks led by 
a docent are conducted the first Tuesday of each month, historical tours the 
third Tuesday, and walks geared toward youngsters the second Saturday. For more 
information and reservations, call (818) 880-4649 or (818) 880-6400, extension 
3500. We attended the Junior Environmental Walk on a Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 9:30 a.m.: The guard at the entry gate directs us to the parking lot, where we 
are greeted by the docent. Our first stop is at the magnificent sycamore trees 
that populate the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The sycamore-lined drive leading to the university might look familiar, the 
docent says. The land was once owned by film director Clarence Brown, and the 
long, estate-like drive was used as the entrance to the plantation Tara in 
"Gone With the Wind." It seems you can't get away from Hollywood around these 
parts. But soon our walk will take us into the territory of coyotes and bobcats 
and the Chumash Indians who once lived hereabouts, long before anyone ever 
heard of screenwriters and movie directors. 
</P>
<P>
 We learn a little more about the sycamores: They usually grow near water and 
require so much moisture that they can dry up a stream. In the fall, when they 
don't need so much water, they can replenish the stream again. And we learn to 
differentiate between a coast live oak -- whose leaves look like little boats, 
to remind us of "coast" -- and the valley white oak, with more traditionally 
shaped oak leaves. Oddly, at one spot on the property, someone seems to have 
grafted two of these types of trees together, apparently successfully, since 
they are huge and growing out of the same spot in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Holes with mounds of dirt beside them indicate a gopher's residence. Elsewhere 
on the ground is early-morning evidence of recent visits by coyotes and even a 
bobcat. 
</P>
<P>
 10 a.m.: We stop at a pond near the university's main building that is home to 
ducks and swans. This area didn't occur naturally, but it is beautiful to 
behold. 
</P>
<P>
 Two pairs of swans are separated from the rest of the flock because they have 
mated. One pair -- the male is called a cob and the female a pen -- are raising 
a brood of babies, or cygnets. We think the cob is extra friendly or wanting 
food, since he's swimming alongside us as we stroll on the road next to the 
pond. Not so, we're told. He is so protective of his brood, he's making sure to 
stay between us and them -- and he'll be very happy once we hit the trail and 
don't come back. 
</P>
<P>
 10:15 a.m.: Next we pause to admire the deodar cedar trees, an import from 
India. We learn that only the female trees bear true cones. The male trees get 
those little caterpillar-looking growths that most of us used to think were 
baby pine cones. They are called catkins. 
</P>
<P>
 10:20 a.m.: As we take the easy walk -- even suitable for stroller-pushing -- 
up into the low mountains above the university, we are taught to identify a 
low, silver-colored plant called turkey mullen, which is said to make birds 
that eat it act sort of drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 We also come across a funnel spider, so called because it builds its web on 
the ground in the shape of a tunnel and waits at the bottom for unsuspecting 
insects. The acorns from the plentiful oaks were used by the Chumash to make a 
grain that they used in cooking. They also used sage to mask their scent when 
hunting. The lighter, grayish-colored sage is purple sage, that fabled plant of 
the Old West. Perhaps the sage helped the Indians avoid any encounters with the 
800-pound grizzly bears we're told once roamed here. 
</P>
<P>
 10:30 a.m.: From the top of the hill we have a magnificent view of the valley 
below, including a mansion built by King Cab Gillette, the razor-blade mogul. 
Sadly, we're told, he never got to live there. Gillette lost his fortune in the 
1929 stock market crash and died of a heart attack soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the trail we see odd-looking pellets of hair and bone and other 
unidentifiable matter. We learn that these have been dropped by owls hunting at 
night. The birds swallow their prey whole, letting their digestive system sort 
things out before spitting the unneeded stuff onto the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 10:45 a.m.: We practice naming the flora on the way back down the hill and 
come upon some early-morning tracks, which we reckon were made by quail, 
coyotes and maybe a large possum. We've learned a lot this morning, but it's 
clear we have a long way to go before becoming honorary members of the Chumash 
tribe. Back at the car, we thank our guide and drive away. Now, as we make our 
way back down the driveway, at least we can smugly note that the sycamores are 
lovely this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.: Exit onto Mulholland and turn left. At Las Virgenes, 
make another left to the entrance of Malibu Creek State Park. It costs $5 per 
car to enter, but for a post-environmental-walk picnic, it's well worth it. 
Look up at the hills beyond the parking area. They'll probably look familiar, 
and not because you once trod them in moccasins in another lifetime. The 
long-running television show "MASH" was filmed here at times, notably the 
opening sequence showing the incoming helicopters flying over them thar hills. 
Other movies, including "How Green Was My Valley" and "Planet of the Apes" were 
also shot here. 
</P>
<P>
 A short trek back along the trails will bring you to a fork in the road. The 
long trail to the right goes back into the gorge and Malibu Lake. The shorter 
route to the left winds up at the rock pond, a perfect place for a sandwich, a 
round of skipping rocks across the still water, and a nap -- near the sage and 
the turkey mullen, under the valley white oak.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; A RARE TASTE OF 'FRESH-MEX'; THE SURPRISING FLAVORS AT 
CHEVYS MAKE THE CHAIN A BETTER CHOICE THAN MOST PLACES IN MEXICO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Max Jacobson reviews restaurants every 
Friday in Valley Life!

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chevys is one of our newer Mexican restaurant chains -- the specialty is the 
increasingly popular "fresh-Mex" style of cooking. There are more than 30 
Chevys, mostly in Northern California. I just returned from a short visit to 
Mexico, so I thought it would be interesting to eat at a Chevys before the 
memories of my trip faded.  
</P>
<P>
 Guess what? I liked it more than most of the places where I ate in Mexico 
(except for a few beachfront taco stands where the specialty was fresh dorado 
in a hot tortilla). 
</P>
<P>
 The Encino branch is distinguished by a giant tortilla-maker called El Machino 
and a stack of empty Corona beer boxes that reach halfway to the ceiling. So 
it's a bit contrived; everything works so well it all ends up looking pleasant. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The dining area is vast, like a warehouse, with exposed ceiling ducts visible 
from all but a few tables out on an enclosed patio. The tables are covered with 
pastel oilcloths and giant, weirdly lifeless tropical plants are spaced 
throughout the dining areas. The de rigueur Mexican decorations -- serapes, 
guitars, driftwood and whatnot -- are present, too, lest we forget where we 
are. It all strikes you as, well, corporate maneuvering, concept traded in for 
soul. Until the food comes. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the menu tips you off first. Read it and you learn, for instance, 
that all flour tortillas are served within three minutes of baking (El Machino, 
for your information, puts out 900 tortillas every 53 minutes), the salsas are 
blended hourly, the meats are never frozen and the only cans in the kitchen 
contain olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as you're seated, you'll get a basket of hot, fresh chips with 
terrific charred tomato salsa, with a subtle and smoky flavor offset by onions 
and jalapenos. It's truly hard to stop eating it. One of my friends got talked 
into trying the prickly pear margarita, so now we all know what it feels like 
to get a buzz off cactus. In spite of the Corona boxes, the beer of choice here 
seems to be Pacifico, a darker, somewhat richer brew sold up and down the 
Mexican Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 You may want to begin with something light. The tamales, stuffed with pork or 
chicken, are handmade every morning in the kitchen. They come three to an 
order, in their husks, and are surprisingly light. Ceviche is made with 
whitefish marinated in lime juice and onion, and comes in a parfait glass, like 
a child's ice cream soda. 
</P>
<P>
 I like the fact that Chevys gives you a choice of three different beans to 
accompany your entree. One is the traditional refried beans, a wet version that 
must have a good deal of canola oil in the recipe. (All fried items here are 
cooked in cholesterol-free canola oil.) The vegetarian black beans are better, 
topped with just a dab of chopped tomato and, upon request, a spoonful of sour 
cream. But I prefer the beans a la charra , rendered smoky by a full-flavored 
minced ham. They're filling, but they round out many of these dishes nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 You may be surprised by the choices. This is not a simple burrito-enchilada 
menu; you'll find quail, trout and deviled shrimp on it. The quail, two to an 
order, are mesquite-grilled and spiced quite mildly (pep them up, if you like, 
with the restaurant's green tomatillo sauce). The trout is generic but 
reasonably tasty, split and charred across the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarones diablo -- sauteed shrimp -- are cooked with more garlic than chili, 
so they're really garlic shrimp, not diabolical shrimp. The only letdown is the 
fajitas. Yes, the meat (pork or beef) is good, but there aren't enough 
vegetables. Our pork came in big meaty chunks with a reddish glaze. The garnish 
-- an onion ring, a slice of green pepper and a slice of red tomato -- wasn't 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are a little more creative here than in most Mexican restaurants. The 
best one is something called dirt cake, a fudge brownie crammed into a ramekin, 
layered with vanilla ice cream and topped with an inch of crumbled Oreo 
cookies. Sopaipillas are fresh fried flour tortillas dusted with cinnamon and 
drenched with honey; they remind me of a Greek dessert. There are also the more 
traditional desserts, fresh fruit empanadas (turnovers) flan and ice creams.  
</P>
<P>

and When

 HELPING HAND: Vietnamese in Orange County haven't forgotten the many others 
who still languish in camps throughout Southeast Asia. The Vietnamese 
Physicians Assn. of Southern California hosts a public meeting tonight with 
Werner Blatter, director of the United Nations refugees commission, at 
Westminster's civic center. . . . The association is pressing a proposal to 
close existing camps, allowing refugees up to 30 years old to emigrate to other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 NOAH'S RIDE: Racehorses have an assortment of unusual names. Like, Peter Noah. 
. . . TV producer Alan Kirschenbaum named his 3-year-old colt, which races at 
Los Alamitos, Peter Noah, after a close friend and fellow producer. Good 
friends, but competitors: Kirschenbaum's TV hit "Coach" duels with Noah's "Cafe 
Americain" on Tuesday nights. And the horse Peter Noah? He won his harness race 
last week at Los Alamitos' opening day, and is back again tonight.

 JOINT HEROES: Judy Richardson was invited to speak at UC Irvine this week to 
help celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. But she hopes to shift 
attention to another African American leader of the 1960s -- Malcolm X. 
Richardson, a civil rights activist from that era, was an associate producer on 
the highly touted King documentary, "Eyes on the Prize." But she's just 
completed work on a new documentary on Malcolm X, to air Jan. 26 on public 
television's "American Experience." Says Richardson: "We started doing Malcolm 
three years ago, before Spike (Lee) did." 
</P>
<P>
 IN HOUSE: Two Democrats trying to climb the political ladder will be on hand 
when the Orange County Trial Lawyers Assn. installs new officers today. . . . 
State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, running for governor, will be speaking. And 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove, running for attorney general, will be 
honored by the group, because he pioneered new probate legislation that 
restricts lawyers' control over their clients' estates.

 ROLE MODELS? A year after Ventura High School's football coach pleaded guilty 
to having sex with a student, the school is trying to fire its swim coach for 
similar conduct, according to a state document (B1). . . . An attorney for Dale 
Hahn, 44, said he did nothing wrong. . . . Hahn isn't the only role model on 
the defensive: Father David Piroli, on trial for allegedly stealing church 
money, says another priest is the real culprit. Now church officials have 
lashed back (B1), calling Piroli's assertion "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 COURT HANG-UPS: Like the attorneys in Erik Menendez's trial (A1), Don Glynn 
knows what it's like to have a long trial end in a hung jury. "It's 
frustrating, especially if it hangs close," said Glynn, the Ventura County 
deputy D.A. who prosecuted Diane Mannes in a 1989 drunk-driving murder trial. 
That jury deadlocked 7 to 5 for conviction, making it one of the 
highest-profile local cases to end in a hung jury. . . . Bright spot: 
"Frequently you learn more about the defense case than you knew before so you 
can better retry it," Glynn said. . . . Mannes pleaded guilty to lesser 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 BUSY SENIOR: Robert S. Lipman is a regular at the Simi Valley Senior Center, 
but don't look for him at the card tables -- he's too busy. . . . "He's a very, 
very active volunteer," said Kathryn Oliver, senior services coordinator. Which 
is why the city's seniors named him Volunteer of the Year. . . . Lipman, 80, 
heads the city's Council on Aging and delivers Meals on Wheels. "He's willing 
to do the grunt work." 
</P>
<P>
 MOVIE MECCA: Camarillo has a mere three movie screens. But it could soon 
become the cinema center of Ventura County with 38 (B1), more than twice as 
many as Ventura, the current leader with 17 screens. . . . The Mann, United 
Artists and Edwards chains have all received city approval for multi-screen 
complexes. City officials doubt all three will be developed, but Edwards plans 
a Thanksgiving opening for its 3,044-seat complex. . . . "Ours is definitely 
going to be built," president Jim Edwards said. "Camarillo is a very good area 
for us."

MAN ARRESTED IN ATTACK ON ICE-SKATER KERRIGAN; CRIME: NEWS REPORTS SAY HE 
CONFESSED INVOLVEMENT. WARRANTS ARE ISSUED FOR AT LEAST TWO MORE PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Arrest warrants were issued Thursday in the attack on Olympic figure skating 
star Nancy Kerrigan and one man was taken into custody, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI arrested the suspect at Portland (Ore.) Airport on a flight from 
Phoenix, but Doug Roberts, Port of Portland spokesman, refused to give any 
details about the man. 
</P>
<P>
 Local news reports identified him as Derrick Smith of Phoenix, and described 
him as the second man to confess his involvement in the alleged conspiracy to 
injure Kerrigan, 24, of Stoneham, Mass. Earlier, Harding's bodyguard, Shawn 
Eric Eckardt, was said to have acknowledged a role in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC news named a Portland man, Shane Stant, as suspected of being the attacker 
who hit Kerrigan in the leg Jan. 6. at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 
Detroit. The assailant escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Police Chief Benny Napoleon in Detroit acknowledged that warrants had 
been issued but did not specify the number or who had been named in them. 
Sources familiar with the investigation told The Times that Portland 
authorities expected to arrest two more men later Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot reportedly involved Tonya Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, 
Eckardt, and several others. Earlier Thursday, Boston television station WCVB 
reported that warrants were issued in Portland for Eckardt, Smith and Stant. 
The station also reported Harding was named in the warrants, but authorities 
denied that. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, 23, won the U.S. Figure Skating Championships last week after her 
chief rival, Kerrigan, was forced to withdraw because of the leg injury 
suffered in the attack. Harding has denied any link to the assault, calling the 
allegations ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys know me better than that," Harding said earlier this week. "I had my 
hopes for a long time of competing against Nancy and proving I'm as good as her 
and better." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding and Gillooly were divorced Aug. 28, according to Columbia County court 
documents, but they later reconciled and have lived together since October. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest developments led investigators to three states -- Michigan, Oregon 
and Arizona -- in an effort to break the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt, the bodyguard, told authorities that Gillooly asked him to arrange 
last week's attack, unidentified law enforcement sources said. The suspects 
were expected to be arrested for conspiracy to commit an assault, a felony 
punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $100,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kerrigan, the 1992 bronze medal winner in Albertville, France, and 
the favorite to win the gold in Lillehammer, Norway, next month, could not 
compete last week, she was later added to the U.S. Olympic team. She and 
Harding will represent the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's injured right knee showed improvement after two days of physical 
therapy, Dr. Mahlon Bradley said in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Detroit news conference, Napoleon said a woman from out of state called 
the Police Department on Saturday and insisted on speaking with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon said the woman indicated that she heard a conversation regarding the 
planned assault on Kerrigan several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon said the woman identified about four people, and he gave the names to 
the FBI. The woman said she listened to a tape of the conversation a few months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot allegedly involved Eckardt, Gillooly, an Eckardt acquaintance in 
Phoenix and a Portland man who attacked Kerrigan for $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit police said they recovered a collapsible metal baton, believed to be 
the weapon. A Detroit resident found it in a trash can behind the arena, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Schiller, executive director of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said 
Harding's participation in the Olympics would not be affected because "there's 
no indication that Tonya's involved at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Figure Skating Assn. in Colorado Springs issued a statement saying it 
would not comment on speculation about the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Ronald J. Ostrow contributed to this story.

JOHAN J. HOLST; LED PLO-ISRAEL PEACE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Johan Jorgen Holst, the Norwegian foreign minister who led secret talks that 
forged the Israel-PLO peace accord and who pledged to pursue peace "as long as 
there is life in me," died Thursday after a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Holst, 56, was discovered dead in his hospital bed after suffering his second 
stroke in two months. He had been foreign minister for less than 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli and PLO leaders mourned Holst's death and praised his contribution to 
their historic agreement for limited Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho area of the West Bank. The accord was signed Sept. 13, but the 
Israeli withdrawal has been delayed by disputes over control of borders and 
security of Jewish settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moment he entered the peace process, it was in the center of his life 
until his last breath," Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said of Holst's 
role in bringing the sides together. "The entire nation of Israel bows its head 
to the memory of this man." 
</P>
<P>
 PLO leader Yasser Arafat called Holst "a great peacemaker who engraved the 
name of Norway in the book of world peace." He promised to name a street and 
square in Jericho after Holst, the PLO news agency Wafa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin also praised Holst, saying he laid the 
foundations for Middle East peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "His contribution and role in the efforts for peace will be a beacon for us in 
the continuation of the effort to bring an end to war and bloodshed," Rabin 
said in a condolence message. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in Moscow for the U.S.-Russia 
summit, issued a statement expressing "deepest sorrow" at Holst's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Holst's contributions to world peace were historic," Christopher said. 
"His personal commitment to reconciliation and peace in the Middle East will 
stand as a work of hope and life for the people of the region." 
</P>
<P>
 Holst was first hospitalized in November for exhaustion, after hectic months 
of travel and work during the negotiations, which were held in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hospitalized again after suffering a stroke in December that affected 
his ability to walk and speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegians were surprised when Holst, a former defense minister, was named 
foreign minister in April. He was not known for his political savvy, and many 
doubted that his talents would measure up to those of Thorvald Stoltenberg, his 
predecessor who resigned to become a U.N. negotiator for the former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a shipwreck investigator, Holst studied Russian in military college 
and was a research fellow at Harvard University in 1961. He studied political 
science at Columbia University in New York and the University of Oslo, 
graduating in 1965. He was a visiting professor at Carleton University in 
Ottawa in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife and their son, Holst is survived by four children from 
his first marriage.

RIORDAN, BURKE TO SEEK AID FOR ANTI-GANG EFFORT; SOCIAL SERVICES: THEY TELL 
COMMUNITY GROUP THEY WILL TRY TO FIND ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE CONTROVERSIAL 
HOPE IN YOUTH PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of a powerful South-Central Los Angeles community group found they 
had friends in high places Wednesday night when Mayor Richard Riordan and 
County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said they would do their best to 
provide more money for a controversial anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
 Their promises to boost city and county funding for the new Hope in Youth 
program came during a standing-room-only meeting of the Southern California 
Organizing Committee at the Phillips Temple Christian Methodist Episcopal 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was called to press the committee's demands not only for more 
money for the program but also for local government officials' help in getting 
a bottling plant to open in South-Central, bringing a supermarket to the 
community and organizing a jobs summit for the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's and Burke's enthusiastic agreement to push the organization's agenda 
brought vigorous cheers and applause from the group, whose confrontational 
techniques often have put political leaders on the hot seat. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Burke pointed out, coming through with the promised additional funds 
for Hope in Youth may not be easy. Both the city and the county are struggling 
with budget deficits spawned by the state's continuing economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to commit $2.9 million to the project during this spring's county budget 
deliberations, Burke promised to do her best. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan promised to include another $5 million for the project in the budget 
proposal he will submit to the City Council this spring and like amounts in 
each of the next three years. The council, however, will have final say.

VENTURA COACH ACCUSED OF SEX WITH 2 STUDENTS; CONDUCT: SCHOOL OFFICIALS ALSO 
CHARGE VENTURA HIGH'S DALE HAHN WITH SUGGESTIVE, IMPROPER BEHAVIOR. HIS LAWYER 
DENIES WRONGDOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura High School's swimming coach had sex with two female students and made 
advances and sexually suggestive comments to others, school officials charged 
in a document filed Thursday with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dale Hahn also raised the grade of one of the girls he slept with to an 
A when it should have been a C or a D, according to the formal list of 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the document also accused him of once discussing sex with his 
chemistry class for an entire period, purchasing alcohol for minors and yelling 
profanities while coaching the water polo and swim teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn, who has been on paid leave since December, said on Thursday, "there is 
nothing I want to say" about the allegations. His lawyer also declined comment 
on specific allegations, but insisted that his client would be vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police recently began an investigation of Hahn after being contacted 
by school officials last month, Sgt. Bob Anderson said. Detectives will begin 
interviews in the next few days, he said. "We're just getting going here." 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations by the Ventura Unified School District marked the second sex 
scandal at Ventura High School in the past 15 months. Football Coach Harvey 
Kochel, who had the most winning-game record in the school's history, was 
convicted in January, 1993, of having unlawful sex with a 15-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura schools Supt. Joseph Spirito said the notoriety from Kochel's 
prosecution and the recent allegations against Hahn have been difficult for the 
school's teachers and students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've certainly had their share of ups and downs," he said. "They're 
feeling like any group would feel right now, 'My goodness gracious, not again.' 
"  
</P>
<P>
 Some students and parents continued to come to Hahn's support; others said 
they are concerned about the impact of the case on the school's image. "It was 
going around school today," said Hannah Murray, a 16-year-old junior. "I was 
mad because our school is always the bad school of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jo McGrath, an attorney hired by the school district to investigate Hahn, 
said she is aware of the anguish at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "And yet, I want people to know this is what is in most every high school in 
our country. That is my professional opinion, so I hope Ventura High School is 
not held up as some kind of oddball example," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn, 44, has taught science and coached the water polo and swim teams at 
Ventura High School for 20 years. He is divorced and has two sons, said Richard 
Schwab, his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has indicated to us there is no substance to any allegations that would 
lead to any disciplinary action," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that everybody will keep an open, objective and unbiased view that 
these are allegations and accusations and certainly do not rise to the level of 
being any evidence or proof. Mr. Hahn, I feel confident, will be vindicated," 
Schwab said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn's mother, Lola, who was at home with her son Thursday, added: "I don't 
have any comment, but my son is a nice guy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-page list of 90 allegations against Hahn was filed with the state 
Office of Administrative Hearings in Los Angeles on Thursday as the district's 
first step in the process of firing Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn will now be entitled to a full hearing by a three-panel state commission 
made up of an administrative law judge and two educators. In the meantime, the 
district is also moving to suspend him without pay. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath said the district hired her firm to investigate Hahn after a female 
student told Ventura High School teacher David Hess of flirtatious comments 
Hahn had made. Hess then wrote a memo to Assistant Principal Helena Reaves 
summarizing the girl's statements. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the document, Hahn asked the girl, "Have you ever considered 
going out with me?" and "Have you ever considered me as a boyfriend?" 
</P>
<P>
 He also told her: "You have sexy legs," and "You don't always have to do what 
your parents say," according to the statement of charges. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath said she interviewed about 50 students, former students, teachers and 
school officials, and described her investigation as "thorough and aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said she eventually found a former student who allegedly had a 
sexual relationship with Hahn when she was a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 That relationship occurred in the 1988-89 school year when Hahn "initiated a 
relationship with (the student) based on 'counseling' her about her parents' 
recent divorce and her breakup with her boyfriend of two years," the document 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 During the rest of that year, Hahn paid for the girl and one of her friends to 
go the Getty Museum, a Kim Carnes concert, a production of Phantom of the Opera 
and other events, the document says. And he bought the girl diamond and pearl 
earrings for Christmas, the document says. 
</P>
<P>
 After inviting the girl over to watch a movie in December, 1988, Hahn began 
kissing the girl and said, "I want to make love to you," the document says. He 
then had sex with her without using birth control, according to accusations 
detailed in the document. 
</P>
<P>
 The same month, Hahn told the girl she had an A in his chemistry class, 
although she actually had earned a C or a D average, the document says. During 
the same school year, Hahn allegedly asked the girl's friend if he could see 
her breasts and said to her, "When you're 18, you're mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Other allegations in the document accuse Hahn of: 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchasing alcohol for about 16 students while he chaperoned a party at a 
beach house after the Ventura High prom. 
</P>
<P>
 * Talking about sex for an entire period with his chemistry class in the 
1992-93 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Making flirtatious comments that offended female students, such as telling 
one last year, "You look good today," and "Your boyfriend is lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a male student told investigators that a female friend said she 
had slept with Hahn last fall after going out to dinner with him, the document 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And on four separate occasions, beginning in 1989, Assistant Principal Reaves 
warned Hahn to stop using profanities in the classroom and while coaching or 
risk suspension without pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the allegations, several students, former students and swimmers 
defended Hahn on Thursday. They said they believed his comments and actions 
have been misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he did say those things, it was a joke, like a guy saying, 'Hey, babe, I 
love you,' " said Marrie Murphy, 16, who is on the swim team. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Crabbe, a sophomore, said: "I think (the allegations) are bull. Hahn 
is just a scapegoat for Kochel. I had him two hours a day (for class and swim 
team) and never saw him do any of those things." 
</P>
<P>
 Crabbe said she was called into the office by investigators and felt they were 
trying to put words in her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to pull things out of you. 'Has he ever done this? Has he ever 
done that?' They pressed you to say, 'Yeah.' They wanted to make him guilty and 
get him out of there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Katherine Pierce, who graduated in 1989 and was on the swim team, said 
Hahn sometimes hugged her, but never in an inappropriate way. "I think of him 
as being a very well-respected man on campus. He's a personable teacher," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chris Connolly, who was on the water polo team the same year, said he was 
not surprised to hear of the allegations. He said the coach had a reputation 
for hugging female students frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there were certain girls he liked. He would take them places and hang 
out with them." he said. "I thought it was kind of weird."

CAMARILLO OKS NEW MOVIE COMPLEX PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo City Council early Thursday morning approved a controversial 
proposal to build an 11-screen, 2,629-seat United Artists movie theater complex 
at a commercial center on the city's east side. 
</P>
<P>
 After a four-hour hearing that ended about 12:30 a.m. Thursday, the council 
voted 4 to 1 to overrule the city's Planning Commission, which last month 
rejected the complex, saying that it would generate too much noise, did not 
have sufficient parking and was generally incompatible with the surrounding 
neighborhood. Mayor Ken Gose cast the lone dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 39,700-square-foot complex, planned for a lot near Adolfo Road 
and Camino Ruiz, is adjacent to an existing shopping and commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
 "After hearing the testimony tonight, I'm not sure this project is compatible 
with the surrounding neighborhood," Gose said. "Although the developer has made 
many modifications, I'm still not sold on this." 
</P>
<P>
 After being turned down by the Planning Commission in December, Pardee 
Construction Co., the company hired by United Artists to build the facility, 
agreed to modify the proposal. The scaled-down plan reduces the number of seats 
by 154 and would alter the complex's surrounding landscaping to reduce noise 
and glare from light coming from the building and parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 In voting to overturn the decision of the Planning Commission, the council 
will send the entire proposal back to the panel for review before casting the 
final vote on the theater complex at its Jan. 26 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 By reducing the number of seats, the proposal was able to comply with the 
city's parking requirements and prevent theater patrons from having to park in 
an adjoining lot and cross a small street to get to the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, a parade of residents who live in housing tracts adjacent 
to the proposed theater complex decried the proposal, saying that it will drive 
their property values down and infringe on their enjoyment of their homes. 
Resident Beth Baratt said the nearby Adolfo Camarillo High School already 
brings extra traffic and noise to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our belief that residential areas and high schools don't mix," Baratt 
said. "It's our belief that residential areas, high schools and movie houses 
really don't mix." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Baratt was resident Adam Chartom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting something of this sort so close to a neighborhood just isn't right," 
Chartom said. "It may be legal to do so in terms of planning and zoning, but it 
is not the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Bill Teller, Ventura County project manager for Pardee 
Construction, the movie complex has been designed so that impacts on the 
surrounding neighborhood will be lessened or eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made a lot of changes, and I think we have worked out all the problems 
that we had with this project," Teller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Charlotte Craven said that with the reduction in seats and other 
environmental modifications proposed by the builder, she could support the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the theater has drawbacks, it is not as detrimental as some potential 
uses for the area, which is zoned for light manufacturing, Craven said. "For 
instance, it's entirely possible -- and legal -- that we could have a business 
in there that deals with hazardous materials. I wouldn't want to see that." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Manager Bill Little agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Pardee has gone out of its way to correct the proposal's deficiencies 
brought up by the Planning Commission," Little said. "I think this is a plan 
that could be a good use for the property." 
</P>
<P>
 The council's backing of the United Artists theater marks the third such 
approval of a massive movie complex in a year's time. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, the Planning Commission approved plans for a 2,700-seat, 
12-screen Mann Theater Corp. complex at an office park on Daily Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the City Council approved a 12-screen, 3,044-seat complex by 
Edwards Theatres Circuit Inc. at the site of a proposed factory outlet mall, 
just south of the Ventura Freeway and a mile east of Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the project over the objections of the city's Airport 
Authority, which concluded that the facility was too close to the airport's 
runway to ensure the safety of patrons and aviators. Council members said they 
based their decision on a consultant's study of the site, which found that the 
planned complex would be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council approved three complexes, city officials believe that 
only one set of theaters will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will come down to whoever can get the financing first," Little 
said.

ARCHDIOCESE DENIES PRIEST WAS FRAMED; COURTS: THE CATHOLIC CHURCH REACTS 
ANGRILY TO FATHER DAVID PIROLI'S CLAIM THAT EMBEZZLED CASH WAS PLANTED IN HIS 
ROOMS AND CAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Reacting angrily to a Simi Valley priest's allegation this week that another 
priest framed him for embezzlement, the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles 
attacked the claim Thursday as "a gross injustice" and said there is no proof 
to back it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Father David Dean Piroli, 37, is on trial for charges that he embezzled 
$60,000 in parishioners' donations from two Ventura County churches -- St. 
Peter Claver in Simi Valley and Sacred Heart in Saticoy.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, attorney Richard Beada said in court he will defend Piroli with a 
countercharge -- that Father James McKeon, former head pastor at St. Peter 
Claver, was actually stealing the money and planted the cash in Piroli's car 
and rectory rooms because Piroli was about to blow the whistle on him. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon had access to the same collection money and church bank accounts as 
Piroli, Beada argued, and worried that Piroli was going to report to the 
diocese that he was skimming so much cash that "the church (was) on the verge 
of collapse."  
</P>
<P>
 Beada also told the court he would have witnesses testify that McKeon was seen 
at a West Hollywood gay bathhouse. He gave the judge a videotape that he said 
proved that assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada said McKeon apparently was stealing money from the church to support 
this activity as "a regular part of his lifestyle."  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele said he would allow Beada 
to use the counter-allegations to defend Piroli, but he refused to let jurors 
see or hear any evidence concerning allegations of homosexuality. McKeon has 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele also rejected the prosecution's bid to show jurors evidence that a male 
prostitute was the man who was with Piroli when Hollywood police arrested him 
in May, 1992, and found small amounts of cocaine and $10,000 cash in his church 
car.  
</P>
<P>
 Steele said Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace can argue that Piroli was close with 
Israel Palacios, but unless she produces a record of a conviction she cannot 
say that Palacios was a prostitute.  
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, Father Gregory Coiro, spokesman for the archdiocese, issued 
this written statement:  
</P>
<P>
 "As the victim of the crimes for which Father David Piroli is on trial, the 
Archdiocese is reluctant to comment on the case which is being competently 
prosecuted by the Ventura County District Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, considering allegations made by the defense attorney, Richard Beada, 
we must declare in no uncertain terms that we are just as appalled as Assistant 
District Attorney Mary Peace who called Mr. Beada's assertions 'outrageous and 
unsupported.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese statement concluded, "It is a gross injustice when an 
individual, who is not on trial, is victimized in open court by allegations 
that are unsubstantiated and which are so defamatory of one's good name." 
</P>
<P>
 Coiro declined any further comment, saying, "Other than the statement, we are 
saying nothing else about this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Beada, who has been barred by a court-imposed gag order from making further 
comment on the case, could not be reached Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection continued Thursday, and testimony is expected to begin next 
week. Piroli faces two felony counts of grand theft.

RAINFALL 60% OF NORMAL FOR SEASON; WEATHER: THE OUTLOOK FOR JANUARY REMAINS DRY 
AND HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED INTO NEXT WEEK. WATER RESERVES ARE ADEQUATE, 
EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County's rainfall is registering 60% of normal for this time of year 
with no hope for rain this month, meteorologists said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters are calling for continuing dry, warm weather, with temperatures 
running up to 10 degrees above normal throughout the county. The county's high 
on Thursday was in El Rio and east Ventura, where temperatures reached 83. Simi 
Valley and Thousand Oaks registered in the high 70s and Ojai had a high of 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Light Santa Ana winds from the east are expected to die down today, making way 
for an onshore sea breeze that will cool temperatures slightly. But the 
above-normal readings are expected to resume Sunday with the help of east 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
 A persistent high-pressure ridge has moved in just offshore, deflecting winter 
storms that would otherwise break up the current dry and warm pattern, 
meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a whole series of storms in the western Pacific," said Constantine 
Pashos, a National Weather Service meteorologist. "But this ridge is preventing 
any storms from hitting the coast. They bounce off and go up to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until it moves, we won't be getting any rain in the Ventura County area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lack of rainfall this month, ground-water specialists said 
underground basins and above-ground reservoirs throughout the county remain in 
good shape after two winters of drought-breaking storms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no immediate cause for concern," said John Weikel, hydrographer for 
the Ventura County Flood Control District. "It takes several years to deplete 
the supply." 
</P>
<P>
 Weikel said it is common for the county to experience dry weeks in the middle 
of otherwise wet years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had several instances in recent wet years of two, three or four weeks 
without any rain," he said. "February is usually the wettest month of the year 
and we're hoping things will turn around by then and bring us back to normal 
levels."

 The dry January has caused farmers to activate irrigation systems and begin 
pumping ground water at a time of year when underground basins are usually 
filling with rainfall, said Earl McPhail, Ventura County agricultural 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crops will be fine because we're irrigating," McPhail said. "But we 
usually like to let Mother Nature take care of the watering this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
 Growers and cities on the Oxnard Plain and along the Santa Clara River pump 
about 250,000 acre-feet a year from the ground, more than what rainwater alone 
can replenish in most years. 
</P>
<P>
 But heavy rainfall during the last two winters allowed the United Water 
Conservation District to capture a record 120,000 acre-feet at the Freeman 
Diversion Dam on the Santa Clara River near Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 That water is diverted to "spreading grounds," where it can soak down into the 
underground basins, said Frederick J. Gientke, manager of the United Water 
Conservation District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going into what is up to now a dry year after spreading water (to 
refill basins) almost continuously for a couple of years," Gientke said. "We're 
pleased with the condition of the ground-water basins." 
</P>
<P>
 Gientke said the district's reservoir at Lake Piru is also in good shape with 
about 45,000 acre-feet, almost half full. That compares to drought years when 
the reservoir was down to 20,000 acre-feet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're real upbeat about this," Gientke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Field, a meteorologist with the Ventura County Air Pollution Control 
District, said the weather has been ideal to keep air pollution levels low. Air 
quality has stayed steadily in the very good range, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Field agreed with other weather forecasters calling for more pleasantly warm 
and dry weather. "Look at it this way: This is probably one of the nicest 
places to be right now in the whole country," he said. County Rainfall

according to the county Flood Control District. Oct. 1 is the beginning of the

ELECTIONS / BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; THOUSAND OAKS' SCHILLO ENTERS RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo on Thursday announced his bid 
for an open seat on the Board of Supervisors, launching his campaign with 
pledges to transform county government. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by half a dozen friends noted for their fund-raising skills, 
Schillo said he was prepared to spend roughly $15,000 to win election in the 
Second Supervisorial District, which stretches from the Conejo Valley to Port 
Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be running for the seat to be vacated in January, 1995, by retiring 
Supervisor Maria VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only one other candidate -- taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings -- has 
officially announced plans to compete in the June election. But at least four 
other people are mulling bids, including Schillo's longtime rival, former 
Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing his candidacy, Schillo stressed the need for more jobs, less 
crime and better social services. But he also presented specific proposals to 
change the way the Board of Supervisors goes about governing Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than tailoring programs to meet a pre-established budget, he said, the 
supervisors should first lay out their priorities and then start crunching 
numbers to determine what's feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all backward now," Schillo said. "If we knew what the supervisors' goals 
were, we could hold them accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his push for more accountability, Schillo also called for the 
supervisors' weekly meetings to be televised -- and rebroadcast at night so 
citizens could tune in after work. 
</P>
<P>
 And he recommended that the board adopt a two-year budget cycle, instead of 
spending months arguing about fiscal matters every year. Thousand Oaks has 
switched to a two-year system, which many officials have found effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his budget idea, many of Schillo's proposals about reforming county 
government stem from his experiences over nearly 10 years on the Thousand Oaks 
City Council. During that decade, he has often been at odds with the Board of 
Supervisors he now hopes to join. 
</P>
<P>
 As a councilman, Schillo has repeatedly criticized the supervisors for 
neglecting Thousand Oaks and for asking the city's affluent taxpayers to 
subsidize services in other parts of the county. He has pushed for city 
redevelopment projects over the supervisors' strong objections, brushing aside 
claims that the Redevelopment Agency would divert much-needed funds from the 
county's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in launching his campaign, Schillo could not resist a plug for Thousand 
Oaks. He called on the supervisors to spend at least $1 million of the money it 
receives from a half-cent sales tax in Thousand Oaks, preferably by boosting 
the city's police services. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his reputation as an unflinching Thousand Oaks partisan, Schillo 
insisted that he could represent the entire district, from quirky Bell Canyon 
to feisty Oak Park to cash-strapped Port Hueneme. And he plans an intensive 
door-to-door campaign to tell voters just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all in the same boat as Thousand Oaks," Schillo said. Calling the 
region a "donor district," he said taxpayers in Thousand Oaks, Port Hueneme and 
the unincorporated pockets give more to the county than they get back in 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not right," Schillo said. "I realize that if elected, I would be 
representing the entire county, but I'm going to focus on the second district. 
There is so much to be done for this district -- we're starting at ground 
zero."  
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk declined to comment on Schillo's campaign, saying she hopes to 
"rise above" the fray. Several potential rivals also said they did not want to 
discuss Schillo's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't have any comment," Schaefer said. "I'm just really busy." 
Hinting that she will decide soon whether to enter the race, she said, "I am 
really pleased with all of the support that is out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential candidate, Ron Stark of the Oak Park Municipal Advisory 
Council who has been mulling a run for VanderKolk's seat, said he might 
consider instead throwing his support to Schillo. In a bid for Oak Park votes, 
Schillo promised to push for direct bus service between his city and Oak Park 
if elected. He also vowed to craft a plan for regional library service in the 
Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank would be a hard person to beat because he's got the name recognition in 
Thousand Oaks and that's where all the votes are," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo also has gained some publicity outside Thousand Oaks as chairman of 
the Ventura County Transportation Commission and the Ventura Council of 
Governments. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected in June -- or in a November runoff -- Schillo would take office in 
January. Schillo's term on the council is not up until 1996, so he will retain 
his council seat if unsuccessful in his supervisorial bid. If Schillo is 
elected, however, Thousand Oaks would probably hold a special election to fill 
his council seat.

 Student body right . . . or wrong: The alumni publication Trojan Family quotes 
columnist Art Buchwald, a onetime USC student, as saying: "Although I never 
participated on any of USC's great teams I did make a vital contribution to 
their athletic program: I took the English tests for the football team." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a serious charge and we call on the Los Angeles City Council to 
investigate, though, of course, Council President John Ferraro will have to 
absent himself from the proceedings. Ferraro was a USC football player when 
Buchwald attended.

 Fastest gun in L.A.: It looks like a big year for that noted Angeleno, Wyatt 
Earp, who died 65 years ago Thursday at age 80 at his modest Mid-City 
residence. His gunplay at the O.K. Corral has inspired two new movies, 
"Tombstone" and the yet-to-be-released "Wyatt Earp" (starring Kevin Costner). 
</P>
<P>
 But let's not overlook his L.A. years. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Glenn G. Boyer points out that "even in his 60s, Wyatt continued to be 
involved in his usual blend of gambling and adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1911, Earp and two other men "were arraigned in L.A. for operating a bunco 
game" at the Auditorium Hotel near Pershing Square, Boyer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Earp was later "absolved of complicity." It may be, Boyer says, that Earp 
"innocently strolled onto the scene where a couple of men, possibly his 
acquaintances, were running their racket."  
</P>
<P>
 Police, by the way, didn't know they had arrested a celebrity. Earp initially 
gave them an alias -- William Stapp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More on the Wild, Wild West Coast: The gunfighter spent his later period in 
the Southland as a miner, gambler, horse owner, real estate agent and screen 
adviser. More tidbits: 
</P>
<P>
 * Before the turn of the century, he raced horses at tracks up and down the 
coast, including the one at Exposition Park (now the site of the Coliseum). 
Occasionally, he rode in harness races himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * He learned to drive an automobile at the age of 70, his wife, Josephine, 
wrote. She said that on one mining trip through the desert, Earp pulled out a 
gun and shot a bull. It wasn't a drive-by, though -- the foolish animal had 
attacked the car. 
</P>
<P>
 * Screenwriters working on Westerns occasionally sounded him out for advice 
but, according to Josephine, he found most to be "damn fool dudes." 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1928, he voted for Al Smith for President at an L.A. precinct because, 
like Smith, he opposed Prohibition. Up until then, Earp had been a Republican 
(a law-and-order Republican, we scarcely need add). 
</P>
<P>
 * Earp and his wife lived in at least nine residences in L.A. -- all rentals. 
He died at 4000 1/2 W. 17th Street, near the corner of Washington and Crenshaw 
boulevards, with his boots off. Among the pallbearers at his funeral were 
Western actors Tom Mix and William S. Hart. miscelLAny:

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; WORKERS PICKET AT STATE HOSPITAL FOR 
INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 60 maintenance workers at Camarillo State Hospital picketed their work 
site Thursday in protest over the state's refusal to provide them with health 
care insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although medical and other personnel at the hospital have health care 
benefits, the maintenance workers do not because they work under contract for 
ServiceMaster, a private company with an $11-million-a-year contract to 
maintain the state's six development centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny Herrera, a maintenance worker for two years at Camarillo State Hospital 
who was on the picket line during lunch Thursday, said workers need the 
benefits to take care of their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people already have families, but I'm just starting mine," he said. 
"I would like to know that if something happened, I would have something to 
fall back on." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, who with his wife is expecting their first child in April, said the 
delivery will be covered by his mother-in-law's insurance. But after that, the 
family has no coverage for health care. They plan to apply for MediCal 
benefits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Arroyo, who has worked at the hospital for four years, said he takes his 
family members to Tijuana when they get sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cheaper there for the doctors and medicine and rooms, everything," he 
said. "But other workers have health care. Why not us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo said he plans to walk the picket line again next week when the action 
resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo demonstration was one of six at California Developmental Centers 
statewide to call attention to the plight of the workers, said Leo Valenzuela, 
spokesman for the Laborers' International Union office in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years the union has tried to get funding through the state budget 
for health care for the contract workers. But Gov. Pete Wilson rejected the 
provision each year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is still paying for it because these people are using the county 
facilities and clinics and MediCal," Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is scheduled to meet for the second time with a federal mediator in 
Sacramento on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to put pressure on them so they will soften up and start 
negotiating with us," Valenzuela said. JOANNA M. MILLER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DISTRICT PLANS FREE AFTER-CLASS PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to keep children off the streets, the Oxnard Elementary School 
District and community members are developing a pilot program that would allow 
youths to remain at school for recreational activities until late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The program may be implemented as early as September and would be free to 
children ages 6 to 12 at schools they attend or live near. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a big, big, problem with young kids, and we are going to work those 
problems through," said Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn, who is heading 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school district would provide the facility, the group working on 
the program is asking the community, and private and public organizations to 
provide staffing and funding. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost approximately $22,000 a year per school to run the after-class 
program. This cost includes staff salary, arts and crafts materials and 
liability insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 The McDonald's restaurant corporation already has agreed to donate $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which initially would be offered at two schools, would be 
administered by a nonprofit organization such as the Boys & Girls Club or the 
Oxnard's Recreation Department.  
</P>
<P>
 The centers would be staffed by high school students and local volunteers and 
supervised by college students who could earn child development credits.  
</P>
<P>
 During the program hours of 3 to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, students would 
have access to selected school areas to do homework or arts and crafts and 
practice sports.  
</P>
<P>
 The program was developed by residents and community leaders who worry that 
children with working parents tend to remain on the streets until their parents 
return home. 
</P>
<P>
 "All over our community, children are at risk because there is not enough 
parental supervision or program activities after school," said Richard 
Figueroa, an Oxnard physician who has helped develop the program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few months, the group, called Associates for Youth, plans to 
finish the proposal and submit it to the school district board for approval.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, a similar program at Rose Avenue School in Oxnard fell apart because 
the children had to pay a fee, organizers said. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BOY SHOT IN NECK MAY BE PARALYZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents of a boy shot in the neck were at a loss Thursday to explain why a 
neighbor allegedly forced his way into their home, chased the boy and shot him, 
possibly leaving the youth paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Natale, 14, remains in the intensive care unit of Ventura County Medical 
Center with no feeling below his shoulders, said his father, Bob Natale of 
Davis. His alleged assailant, Brian Adams, 21, is in the Ventura County Jail 
after turning himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the bullet fractured Kevin's vertebral column, and the slug 
remains lodged in his shoulder, his father said. Doctors still don't know if 
the boy will be paralyzed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just have to wait and hope for the best," Natale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin and his best friend were playing video games alone in the family's 
Ventura Keys home Wednesday evening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Adams rang the bell, then forced the door open while brandishing a 
9-millimeter handgun. He fired at least two shots as Kevin tried to run away, 
and his third shot hit Kevin in the neck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting comes after an April incident in which Adams allegedly punctured 
the tires on a car belonging to Kevin's family after Kevin accidentally hit 
Adams' car with a baseball while playing catch with his stepfather, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe (Adams) would hold a grudge for that long," said Kevin's 
father. "The attack appears to have come out of the blue. It definitely was 
unprovoked." 
</P>
<P>
 Zevart Adams, the alleged assailant's mother, said she was shocked by what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew nothing about any problems between the two," she said. "I knew 
something happened a few months ago, but I can't say anything more. I didn't 
even know there was a gun in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin's father was optimistic that his son would soon be able to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real athletic kid," he said while waiting for a doctor's report.  
</P>
<P>
 Natale was joined at Kevin's bedside by Kevin's mother, sister, stepfather and 
grandparents. His grandfather is former Ventura County Sheriff John MacIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of support," he said. "I know it means a lot to Kevin." SCOTT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BACK-TO-BASICS SCHOOL PLAN GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After getting rave reviews for their proposal for a new back-to-basics school, 
Ventura education officials have decided to move forward with their plan to 
open such a school as early as next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Unified School District board decided this week to pick a 
principal for the proposed school from among the current principals at the 
district's 17 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, board members agreed that Supt. Joseph Spirito should form a 
committee of parents and school staff to help decide which of the 17 elementary 
schools should be converted to a back-to-basics educational institution. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed by Spirito, the school would impose a rigid dress code, require 
parents to volunteer and enforce a strict homework policy. 
</P>
<P>
 T-shirts, jeans and shorts would be forbidden. Girls at the school would have 
to wear dresses or long pants, and boys' attire would be restricted to collared 
shirts and slacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Spirito last week revealed his plans to establish such a school, 
district officials have received much encouragement for the idea from parents 
and elementary school administrators, Spirito told the board Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all 8,000 elementary kids' parents want a school like this," he said to 
the board. "I'm not naive. But I can guarantee you we can fill one school like 
this, if not more." 
</P>
<P>
 Although board members gave their support to the proposal, Trustee Cliff 
Rodriguez said he wants to ensure that students from all neighborhoods in the 
city would have a chance to attend the new institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said he also would like to see a strict homework policy enforced at 
all of the district's schools. "If we're going to go up a notch, I'd want all 
the schools to go up." MAIA DAVIS

 A meal left unattended on a stove has been blamed for a house fire in Ventura, 
while an arsonist is believed responsible for a car fire that destroyed a 
nearby storage shed in El Rio, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two unidentified youths who stopped to fight the blaze that broke out at a 
home in the 6600 block of Ralston Street in Ventura on Wednesday were overcome 
by smoke, Ventura Fire Battalion Chief Michael Lavery said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured passersby were taken to Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, 
where one was treated for smoke inhalation and the other for breathing problems 
from asthma that was aggravated by the smoke, Lavery said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which began about 3 p.m. when a resident accidentally left food 
cooking on the stove, was confined to the kitchen area, although smoke and heat 
caused damage throughout the residence. Fire officials estimated the damage at 
$30,000 to the structure and $10,000 to its contents. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 7 p.m. Wednesday, county firefighters were summoned to the 2700 
block of Alvarado Street in El Rio, county fire spokeswoman Tracy Valencia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they arrived, firefighters found that a fire set in an abandoned car had 
spread to an adjacent hut, heavily damaging the storage shed and the engine 
parts stored inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said an arsonist had set the fire, which caused an estimated 
$10,000 damage to the Quonset hut and destroyed an estimated $5,000 worth of 
engine parts. The owner of the structure was not immediately identified, 
Valencia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters contained the fire within 20 minutes, she said. PATRICK McCARTNEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MOTORIST CHARGED IN FATAL ACCIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 41-year-old Oxnard man has been arrested on felony drunk driving charges 
after he slammed his pickup truck into a disabled vehicle and killed a 
24-year-old Ventura man, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 7:50 p.m. Wednesday on Vineyard Avenue north of 
Simon Way while Amanpreet Singh was pushing his Mitsubishi pickup truck in a 
southbound lane, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Garcia was driving south on Vineyard at high speed when he struck 
Singh's pickup truck from behind, the CHP said. The impact killed Singh 
instantly and threw his body 120 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's pickup truck then spun into the northbound lanes and stopped. While 
Garcia was standing in the middle of the roadway, his pickup truck was struck 
by a vehicle driven by 29-year-old Matthew Paul Klasen of Fillmore. Klasen 
suffered minor injuries but was not taken to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia suffered minor injuries and was treated at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center and released into police custody. He was being held Thursday in Ventura 
County Jail on suspicion of felony drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter 
with gross negligence. His bail was set at $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh was driving to his job at a convenience store on Wooley Road in Oxnard 
when he was killed, said Deputy Coroner Zelmira Isaac. 
</P>
<P>
 A CHP spokesman said the agency is looking for witnesses to the accident to 
corroborate information gathered from physical evidence at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP Officer Chris Day said he believes two youths between the ages of 13 and 
15 may have seen the accident. People with information should call Day at 
654-4571. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOOL BOARD EASES RULES FOR SPEAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning next month, the Simi Valley school board will change a longstanding 
policy to make it easier for the public to speak at board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Simi Valley Unified School District on Tuesday decided to 
allow latecomers to fill out and hand in speaker cards, which indicate their 
desire to speak on a particular issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, people who wanted to speak had to turn their speaker cards in to 
the board's secretary within moments after the 7 p.m. meetings began.  
</P>
<P>
 Starting Feb. 1, the cards will be accepted up to the time that the speaker's 
agenda item comes up for board discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives people more freedom to address the board," said board member Doug 
Crosse. "We came up with a better way." 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Carla Kurachi agreed. "A lot of times, people do watch 
(meetings) on television at home and decide they want to come down and speak," 
Kurachi said. BRENDA DAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 2 BANKS ROBBED IN SEPARATE INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lone robbers have struck banks in Fillmore and Ventura, bringing the number of 
bank robberies in Ventura County to four so far this year, the FBI said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A man described as having a noticeable scar above his left eye entered a 
branch of Household Bank on Telegraph Road in Ventura at 3 p.m. Wednesday and 
handed a demand note to a teller, said FBI Special Agent Gary Auer. 
</P>
<P>
 He fled after receiving an undisclosed amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber, who witnesses said appeared to be in his 30s and about 5 feet, 9 
inches in height and about 160 pounds, did not display a weapon, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before 6 p.m. Wednesday, a man entered the Wells Fargo Bank branch on 
Ventura Street in Fillmore, acted as if he had a gun in his pocket and demanded 
money from a teller, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 He fled on foot after receiving an undisclosed amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber disguised his appearance by pulling a knit cap down over his face, 
with eye holes cut from the material. Witnesses described the man as 5 feet, 10 
inches in height with a medium build. 
</P>
<P>
 No customers were in the bank at the time, and investigators are still 
evaluating film from a security camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Auer said the suspects do not appear to match the description of other 
suspects in recent Ventura County bank robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, we have two new players," Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 45 bank robberies in the county in 1993, and 98 in 1992. PATRICK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 2 SENTENCED FOR BANK ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men have been sentenced to federal prison in connection with separate 
Ventura County bank robberies, the FBI announced.  
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin James Greenspoon, 21, of Santa Barbara received a seven-year sentence 
for the July 27, 1993, robbery of a Ventura County National Bank branch in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspoon was identified as a suspect in the robbery from a description of 
the getaway vehicle. On parole from a forgery conviction, he was arrested on 
Aug. 20 when he appeared at the state parole office in Santa Barbara for a 
routine visit, said FBI Special Agent Gary Auer. 
</P>
<P>
 During plea bargaining, Greenspoon confessed to the robbery of Santa Barbara 
Bank and Trust in Santa Barbara one week earlier, Auer said. The FBI believes 
he may have been involved in two other bank robberies in Santa Barbara as well, 
Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspoon pleaded guilty to a single count of bank robbery Nov. 2 and was 
sentenced Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 7, Mario Fernando Lopez, 27, of Ventura was sentenced to four years 
and 10 months in the same court for the May 7, 1993, robbery of a Bank of 
America branch on Telephone Road in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 An anonymous call led investigators to Lopez, while fingerprints on a demand 
note left at the bank confirmed his identification as the robber, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was indicted for the May 7 robbery and another robbery at the same bank on 
April 26. He pleaded guilty in September to a single count of bank robbery.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; GADFLY FORMS GROUP TO EVALUATE 
COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He sits through every Thousand Oaks City Council meeting, offering comments 
and taking notes, and now perennial gadfly Ekbal Quidwai wants to gather other 
council junkies into a new citizens action group. 
</P>
<P>
 Quidwai, a Pakistani immigrant who has lived in Southern California for nearly 
23 years, has founded the Concerned Citizens of the Thousand Oaks City Council 
to analyze and influence the fractious politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to convene the group regularly to discuss the council's actions, 
debate upcoming issues and suggest items for future agendas. Already, more than 
a dozen people have expressed interest in joining, Quidwai said. The first 
meeting is scheduled at 7 p.m. Feb. 10 in the Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Quidwai's group joins a handful of other grass-roots organizations formed in 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah leads the Citizens Q of L Action Alliance, which is working 
on crime-fighting proposals. Our Town Forum gathers residents concerned about a 
potential anti-development bias in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups focus on specific areas of Thousand Oaks. The Heart of the City 
Committee looks at issues relating to the city's central neighborhoods, for 
example, and the Newbury Park Civic Organization and Residents to Preserve 
Newbury Park emphasize development issues in western Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Quidwai said he hopes his group will work "not on (the principle) of 'What's 
in it for me,' but for the common good. We want to see less divisive items on 
the agenda and more proactive measures, like longer library hours or cleaning 
up city streets." STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CONSERVATION GROUP REVEALS 14-POINT 
PLAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To ensure protection of 12,000 acres of parkland in and around Thousand Oaks, 
the Conejo Open Space Conservation Authority has established a 14-point program 
for the upcoming year. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's priorities include preparing a management plan for rugged Hill 
Canyon, which is under consideration as a site for a municipal golf course and 
trail system.Reacting to last fall's wildfires, the five COSCA trustees also 
plan to identify areas in danger of erosion or mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 To better acquaint the public with COSCA's land holdings, the group will 
prepare a resource guide describing the trail network around North Ranch. The 
trustees will also try to boost awareness of Wildwood Park facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key goal is to develop a maintenance plan to keep trails, fences and 
park buildings in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "The maintenance plan is a real nuts-and-bolts kind of job that's real 
important," said COSCA member Rorie Skei of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy. "We don't want it to fall by the wayside. Luckily, we don't have 
the community saying 'we can't have open space because it's too expensive to 
maintain.' But 10 years down the road, who knows what will happen. That's why 
we want to have this plan in place and operational." 
</P>
<P>
 Skei was reelected this week to head COSCA, a joint agency of the Conejo 
Recreation and Park District and the city of Thousand Oaks. The group meets 
every other month in public session at Thousand Oaks City Hall. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY TO DISCUSS USE OF RECYCLABLE 
GOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the urging of Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski, the Thousand Oaks City Council 
will consider requiring the use of recyclable material at all city-sponsored 
events, even if those paper plates or plastic cups are more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding up a plastic cup that is accepted in the city's curbside recycling 
program, Zukowski urged city staff to look carefully at each product purchased 
for city events such as Conejo Valley Days or the Civic Arts Plaza grand 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It still costs more to divert material from the landfill (for recycling) than 
it does to fill up the landfill," Zukowski said. "Obviously, something is wrong 
with the equation. We must encourage markets for the (recyclable) material we 
are diverting from landfills." 
</P>
<P>
 Buying recycled -- or recyclable -- goods for city events makes sense, 
Councilman Alex Fiore agreed, even if the environment-friendly product costs 
slightly more. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously to ask staff for a report on how the city can 
boost the market for recycled goods. STEPHANIE SIMON

PAY HIKE FOR COURT OFFICER DELAYED; GOVERNMENT: JUDGES SAY THEY WANT MORE TIME 
TO STUDY THE CONTROVERSIAL RAISE PROPOSED FOR SHEILA GONZALEZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County judges on Thursday postponed their decision to raise the pay of 
the county courts administrator until next month, saying they needed more time 
to study the controversial proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-judge committee has recommended Sheila Gonzalez's salary be raised, 
although committee officials and other key judges have refused to publicly say 
how much of a pay hike is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, 50, is Ventura County's courts executive officer, clerk and jury 
commissioner. She earns a base salary of $96,624, plus about $25,000 in perks 
and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months ago, the judges considered raising her salary by $23,000, but 
backed away from the pay hike at that time, saying the four-judge committee 
needed to compare her salary with those of her colleagues around the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In its analysis of comparable positions, the committee determined that 
Gonzalez deserves a raise given her extensive responsibilities, and forwarded a 
recommendation for a pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 But at its monthly meeting Wednesday, judges from the Municipal and Superior 
courts decided to delay the decision because several of them wanted to examine 
the various salary figures that the committee had compiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't surprised," said Superior Court Presiding Judge Melinda A. Johnson, 
who supports a raise for Gonzalez. "It's a big issue. I was sure there would be 
at least a few people who would wish to talk about it more." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Municipal Court Presiding Judge John R. Smiley refused to disclose 
how big of a raise is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the idea of a pay raise for Gonzalez has generated some criticism 
from a local taxpayer activist and several county officials, Smiley said the 
judges who asked for more time to consider the proposal are not necessarily 
bent on reducing the size of the proposed raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I frankly believe some of the people who wanted more time to think about this 
are genuinely considering proposing something higher than what the committee 
recommended," Smiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Smiley, Johnson nor Assistant Municipal Court Presiding Judge Barry B. 
Klopfer would say which judges asked to have the raise issue postponed. Klopfer 
and Smiley were two of the four members of the committee that made the 
recommendation to give Gonzalez a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley said the judges have no intention of disclosing the amount of any raise 
until the matter is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the public has an absolute right to know when, and if, we have a 
salary increase for Sheila," Smiley said. "But until that number is decided 
upon, it is sheer speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other judges said they suspect the amount may change at the next 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think judges as a group are used to making independent decisions," Klopfer 
said. "The fact that they wanted more time isn't a particular surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State law stipulates that the court executive officer's salary in each county 
be fixed by Superior and Municipal court judges and paid from the county 
general fund.

<P>
 Superior Court Judge James M. McNally did not attend Thursday's meeting. He 
was a critic of the proposal to give Gonzalez a $23,000 raise last May. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted after his colleagues made a decision to delay their vote until Feb. 
7, McNally said the extra time would be helpful for evaluating the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased to hear that we are going to get some time to look at these 
numbers," McNally said. He said he has not been informed of the size of the 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview before the judges' meeting, however, he said he would oppose 
any raise for Gonzalez that exceeded 5% of her salary, or about $5,000. Other 
critics have said they would oppose any raise of more than 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 California judges received a 5% raise last year, McNally said. He said 
Gonzalez should not receive more than a 5% raise because of the county's 
ongoing financial shortfall. He pointed out that county supervisors have 
delayed raises for other employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has nothing to do with Sheila Gonzalez," McNally said of his opposition to 
a raise of more than 5%. "We're not out of this economic wilderness yet."

GAY CIVILIAN WORKER AT NAVAL STATION DENIES TAKING NEW JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 A gay civilian employee at the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station said 
Thursday that the Navy lied this week when it announced that he had accepted a 
job at the base, ending his self-imposed leave from the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Swann, 35, of Port Hueneme said Thursday that he did not accept a 
job as a program analyst at the base's comptroller's office and that he and his 
American Civil Liberties Union attorneys are still negotiating a settlement 
with the Navy over his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did accept a call from one of their human resources department officers, 
but I did not in any way accept the job that they offered me," Swann, a former 
Marine Corps sergeant and Navy reservist, said Thursday during a brief 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Navy spokesman Alan Alpers, Swann was offered the analyst's 
job Wednesday morning and told officials that he would return to the base next 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can tell you is that we offered Mr. Swann the job and that he told us 
that he would accept the position," Alpers said. "We never said or implied that 
the case was settled or over. We just said that he accepted the job and we 
stand by that statement." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Swann, ACLU lawyer Alan Friel nor Alpers could explain Thursday why 
both sides had such widely varying opinions of Wednesday's events. 
</P>
<P>
 Swann worked at the base for 12 years as a missile program analyst before he 
left his post last June, claiming he was being harassed and physically 
threatened because of his sexual orientation and because of his support for a 
repeal of a ban against gays in the military.

SMALL OIL SPILL REPORTED OFF FERGUSON PIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A small amount of oil spilled into the ocean off the Ferguson Piers seven 
miles north of Ventura this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil Oil, which has operated at the site since 1928, is capping the nine 
wells there.As workers were preparing to cap one of the wells, 10 to 15 gallons 
of oil spilled into the water Wednesday, a company spokesman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the small size of the spill, four or five boats from Clean Seas in 
Carpinteria and a beach crew from Ecology Control Inc., an oil spill cleanup 
contractor that works for Mobil, went to the scene. A boom was placed around 
the oil at 10:30 a.m. and a skimmer picked up the spill within a few hours, 
said David Barger, a business team supervisor for Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure we responded promptly," said Barger, who drove out to 
the site from his office in Bakersfield. "We have a good track record there. 
The only other spill I remember was in 1991 when six gallons got into the 
water."  
</P>
<P>
 The state Lands Commission confirmed Barger's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Mobil started its operation on the piers, it has drilled 86 wells that 
have produced 14 million barrels of oil. But declining oil production at its 
nine remaining wells persuaded Mobil to abandon the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil is removing all of the drilling equipment and pumps from the piers and 
will plug each well with more than 100 feet of concrete. Each well will be cut 
off at the ocean floor so nothing protrudes from the ocean bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Barger said the oil was cleaned up by late Wednesday afternoon.

NOT EXACTLY A CITADEL OF ENLIGHTENMENT; MILITARY SCHOOL'S REFUSAL TO ADMIT 
WOMEN IS A MISTAKEN USE OF TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 151 years the Citadel still doesn't get it. The state-funded military 
college in Charleston, S.C., still arrogantly refuses to admit women into its 
cadet corps.The practice is discriminatory, outdated and just plain wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Faulkner, 18, was accepted last year as a Citadel cadet on the basis 
of her high school transcript, in which references to her gender were deleted. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Citadel learned Faulkner is female, it refused to let her attend the 
cadet classes, which are held during the day. (The college allows women to 
teach and to attend only evening and summer classes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner sued, challenging the Citadel's all-male policy. She won the right to 
attend day classes while her lawsuit was being heard and managed to register 
for classes before Supreme Court Justice William H. Rehnquist granted a stay on 
Wednesday, keeping her from actually going to school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citadel and Virginia Military Institute are the only all-male, 
state-supported military colleges in the United States. Both of the schools 
have been targets of federal lawsuits alleging exclusionary practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Public funds should not be used to support -- indeed, in effect to condone -- 
such practices. South Carolina state appropriations fund about 28% of the 
Citadel's operating budget for the cadet, summer and evening classes. The 
Citadel also receives federal funding for its ROTC program. 
</P>
<P>
 The college says its mandate for the cadet corps program is to provide men a 
liberal arts education in a strict military environment to foster leadership. 
However, only 30% of the corps graduates go on to military service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citadel is mistakenly using tradition in an effort to justify its 
separate-and-unequal policy. To exist in such a time warp and hold to such an 
appalling double standard today undermines the very tradition of leadership 
that the Citadel claims to perpetuate.

IS THERE A SECOND ACT IN NATO'S LIFE?; COLD WAR ALLIANCE STRUGGLES TO CLARIFY 
ITS MISSION IN NEW ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Testifying in 1949 before a skeptical Senate committee on the proposed NATO 
Treaty, Secretary of State Dean Acheson bluntly warned that "unity in Europe 
requires the continuing association and support of the United States. Without 
it free Europe would split apart." Remarkably, nearly half a century and 
hundreds of billions of dollars in defense outlays later, the political 
rationale underlying the American commitment to the 16-member organization 
continues to be based foremost on the perceived need to bolster Europe's 
cohesion and stability. 
</P>
<P>
 As a recent NATO statement put it, "the transatlantic partnership remains 
vital for European security and stability." Recast bluntly but not unfairly 
from diplomatese, what that suggests is that if NATO's chief "transatlantic" 
partner left the alliance, Europe might very quickly revert to its old habits 
of internecine conflict. It's because maintaining continental peace and 
stability is seen as directly affecting U.S. national security that President 
Clinton has promised to keep 100,000 American troops in Europe. The Europeans, 
needless to say, are delighted. But what neither they nor the Clinton 
Administration have yet provided is a coherent explanation of just what those 
troops are now supposed to do. 
</P>
<P>
 WOBBLY WAYS: Originally, of course, U.S. forces -- and especially the nuclear 
umbrella they provided -- had a mission that was clear and understandable to 
ally and foe alike: to defend Western Europe by deterring aggression from the 
Soviet Union. In that light the alliance succeeded. Aggression did not occur, 
the Soviet Union is no more, the Warsaw Pact has been dissolved, the threat of 
direct aggression from the East has all but disappeared. Mission accomplished. 
Now, having achieved its goal, NATO is casting about for a new role. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a stab at defining that role at its Rome summit meeting in 1991 when 
it identified instability in Eastern Europe as the major new challenge facing 
it. But given a chance to arrest instability in Bosnia -- and halt 
unconscionable abuses of human rights at the same time -- the alliance, to 
borrow a phrase from Margaret Thatcher, went wobbly. An organization that was 
ready to risk nuclear war in defense of its own principles and territory could 
not muster the political will to punish banditry in the Balkans. So much for 
boldly meeting new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO's credibility has not, of course, been wholly compromised. Witness the 
eagerness of four Eastern European states -- Poland, Hungary, the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia -- to join the club and be sheltered under its protective 
military umbrella. Wisely, NATO has decided that expansion eastward, which 
would put NATO forces smack on the borders of the former Soviet Union, is 
inadvisable at this time. Instead NATO has approved a stopgap U.S. plan, 
"Partnership for Peace," that offers limited forms of military cooperation to 
the four states. They have accepted it, if not enthusiastically. But it's clear 
that some -- Poland especially -- still are pressing for full membership. 
</P>
<P>
 AN EASTERN CHILL: The main reason for doing so is understandable. The rebirth 
of militant nationalism in Russia has cast a chill of fear over all nearby 
countries. The trouble is that to bring the four nervous eastern states into 
NATO now would be to say in effect that an anti-Soviet alliance had evolved 
into an anti-Russian one. Such a needless misstep could only boost the fortunes 
of those reactionaries in Russia who despise and seek to reverse the political 
and economic changes under way there. 
</P>
<P>
 What, then, is NATO to be all about, and what should it be doing to promote 
European stability and security? In 1990 NATO reaffirmed that it would remain a 
"defensive alliance." But, all important, it has yet to say against whom the 
alliance is directed or what means it is prepared to use. Such vagueness is 
plainly not a mark of confidence and strength but of worrisome confusion.

TRUE AIM FOR ANTI-CRIME SUMMIT; WILSON SHOULD FOCUS ON GUN CONTROL AS MUCH AS 
ON DEALING WITH CRIME AFTER THE FACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The issue that will draw Gov. Pete Wilson and more than 100 others to 
Hollywood Wednesday and Thursday is, indisputably, of utmost importance. 
Violent crime in our cities and suburbs is eroding society's sense of security 
and well-being; it literally is changing the way Californians live and the way 
they feel about their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime summit -- Wilson's idea -- is a good way to bring together the best 
minds in the state to talk about facts, funding and legislative strategies. And 
this is a particularly good time to talk about one of the best and most direct 
strategies for reducing gun crime: reducing the number of guns in circulation. 
However, a number of key figures actively seeking solutions to rising gun 
violence in California have yet to be invited. Some who have asked to 
participate have received a rather indifferent response from the governor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 We're concerned that the agenda of this two-day meeting may focus too heavily 
on options for dealing with criminals and their victims after the fact and not 
enough on preventing crime in the first place. We're especially worried that 
the governor and the participants he has invited may avoid discussing the best 
preventive of all, tight restrictions on private gun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun sales in California last year set a record; Californians purchased 665,229 
firearms -- about two-thirds of them handguns -- an increase of 22% over 1992. 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren attributes this new high in gun purchases to a loss of 
faith by Californians in government's ability to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
 This, then, is Wilson's moment: Yes, governor, lead a memorial ceremony 
honoring victims of violent crime, as you plan to do. Debate gang-prevention 
strategies and longer prison terms for repeat felons. But speak out loudly and 
clearly as well against the arms race under way in California's cities. Talk 
about the very real danger of gun accidents attendant to keeping guns in the 
home. Talk about the high risk that guns bought for protection will be used 
against their owners. Direct the attorney general to move much more quickly 
than he has to add new models to the list of assault guns already prohibited 
under state law. Hear from legislators, including those from the other side of 
the aisle, who seek limits on the sale of ammunition and on the sale and 
private ownership of the weapons themselves. Listen to the state's big-city 
mayors, who, like many of us, often go to bed dreading the body count at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, devote as much time to strategies for controlling guns as to ways of 
squeezing more prisoners into the state's already crowded correctional 
facilities. That's a summit agenda that would produce results.

CLINTON AND WHITEWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In 10 years in Congress I have never seen a more irresponsible piece of 
journalism than Lars-Erik Nelson's Column Left (Jan. 11) on the Whitewater 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson writes that over a recent breakfast I "talked easily about impeaching 
President Clinton" and engaged in "offhand, reckless speculation. . . ." He 
notes that "the very word impeachment puts his legitimacy as President in 
doubt," and adds "Partisan politicians like Armey are joined by the howling 
jackals of the press in using the sly weasel words of accusatory politics." 
</P>
<P>
 The first time I ever heard the word impeachment used in connection with 
Whitewater was when Nelson raised the prospect of impeachment at that 
breakfast. Nelson quotes me accurately as saying that "these things (political 
scandals) take off like an amoeba in all directions," but neglects to note that 
after he repeatedly pressed me on the prospect of impeachment, I repeatedly 
told the reporters present that I was not there to talk about impeaching the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the points I made: I don't know what an investigation will turn up, 
but the circumstances certainly merit one. I don't know if there's anything 
there that would lead to impeachment, and have never heard the prospect 
discussed by any Republican in Congress. Political manipulation of a 
government-guaranteed savings and loan for personal gain is a serious charge, 
and I think the President should be forthcoming with information. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's column is like the old "when did you stop beating your wife" line. He 
asks me about impeaching the President, I answer his question, then he blasts 
me for "talk(ing) easily about impeaching President Clinton." What a crock. I 
feel sorry for his readers. 
</P>
<P>

 * Why it is that, contrary to our system's having placed the burden of proof 
on the prosecution, the Clintons must prove their innocence -- to the 
satisfaction of clearly partisan Republicans and the so-called "liberal" press 
-- of incredibly vague, unspecified and wholly unsubstantiated allegations, 
based on nothing but speculative innuendo and accusatory conjecture? 
</P>
<P>
 And especially since Republicans, with their record of formal indictments and 
convictions, and legacy of insulting the public with thoroughly implausible 
denials of wrongdoing, have conveniently pardoned themselves from the rule of 
law, proclaiming that their self-serving conspiracies, cover-ups and sundry 
other violations of the Constitution were motivated by "patriotism," and the 
mainstream media just yawned? 
</P>
<P>
 Should an independent counsel be appointed to investigate the unspecified 
wrongdoing which the Republicans have suggested were behind Bill Clinton's 
student visa to Moscow? If not for that, then why for this (and vice versa)? 
Why isn't the press' focus instead on the monumental hypocrisy, pathological 
cynicism, and basic Joe McCarthy character which motivate the Republicans?

 * Apparently the NAFTA treaty has dissolved and all remembrance of it has 
died. It was so nice to see the two warring army's join and fight together for 
a common goal. But the civil war rages on; the Democratic army is digging in to 
protect itself from the Republican barrage. The new hill to be taken: 
Whitewatergate. Leading the troops is Gen. Bob Dole, who has been heard 
rallying the troops by yelling, "Remember Iran Contra." Oh, who could forget 
that victory, the "I don't remember" and "I wasn't present" battle cries rang 
out to keep the casualties to a single marine. 
</P>
<P>
 Long live the memory of Oliver North. 
</P>
<P>
 Will this battle have the same outcome? I believe so. Commander in Chief 
Clinton has his top tacticians and strategists scattering about collecting all 
the top secret documents. For if these documents were to fall into enemy hands, 
Gen. Dole may have a victory as profound as the one known as the "Battle of 
Tricky Dick."  
</P>
<P>
 While the armies bombard each other with accusations, slander and pointed 
fingers, little civilian girls get kidnaped and killed, commuters on subways 
get slaughtered, and the number of gun sales in Los Angeles continues to rise. 
It is time for both of the armies to put up the white flag and return to 
protecting, serving and being all that they can be for the citizens that 
enlisted them.

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Robert Kasten's column (Commentary, Dec. 27) provides a thoughtful analysis 
of why the United States should support Taiwan's participation in the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of the Republic of China on Taiwan have worked very hard to 
accomplish remarkable economic, political and social changes over the past 40 
years.Taipei has shared its success by providing economic aid to Latin 
American, African and other Asian countries. Even Washington has encouraged 
Taipei to participate in multilateral efforts to promote global prosperity. 
Taiwan belongs only to the people living there. Neglecting this population and 
its government is a gross violation of the universality of membership 
principles which the United Nations upholds. Taiwan's people deserve better 
than this.  
</P>
<P>
 As president of the Taiwan Benevolent Assn. of America, I feel the United 
States should add its vote to those who believe the Republic of China on Taiwan 
has earned a U.N. seat.

<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am writing regarding your Dec. 7 articles "Insurance Top Concern for 
Laguna Fire Victims" in Orange County and "Putting a Premium on Trust" in other 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
 These articles are described as part of a series that is focused on the lives 
of the Laguna Beach residents of nine homes destroyed on Buena Vista Way, five 
of which are insured by Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that these articles have no balance since they focus almost 
entirely on the particular complaints of an individual, insured by Farmers, to 
the near exclusion of other, satisfied residents of the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Most disturbing, the editing of the story read by the majority of your readers 
was absolutely inexcusable. This story did everything to create a negative 
impression among readers. From the headline, "Putting a Premium on Trust," to 
the text, millions of readers of this story were left with the unmistakable 
message that they cannot trust Farmers Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers is extremely proud of our response to the Southland fires -- our 
claims team and service to customers are second to none. We have expedited 
relief to hundreds of claimants and we are paying in excess of $80 million in 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 More than the harm done by these articles to Farmers' reputation as a 
business, which dates from our founding here in Los Angeles in 1928, we are 
concerned about the personal pain they have caused our agents and employees. To 
produce an effective response to a major disaster requires extreme efforts of 
many people. We have claims adjusters from around the country who left their 
homes and families on a moment's notice to arrive in Laguna Beach when the 
fires were still burning. 
</P>
<P>
 Our agents instantly began calling their customers and surveying the stricken 
neighborhoods to learn who needed assistance. They offered to do whatever was 
necessary, including taking people into their own homes. Hundreds of Farmers' 
employees, agents and district managers worked around the clock to provide 
service that was not contained in any job description. 
</P>
<P>
 We have highly motivated people who are committed to doing whatever it takes 
to bring our customers satisfaction. So it hurts to see their efforts 
discounted in a story focusing in such a negative way on one claim. Bear in 
mind that your stories concentrated on one of more than 1,700 claims we 
received, more than 100 of which were totally destroyed homes.

 * With regard to Allan Coleman's opinion that the Democrats are trying to drag 
us back to the '60s (letter, Jan. 5), I hope he's right and that they succeed. 
The '60s were an exciting time when we dared to achieve great things and 
actually succeeded sometimes. Such a contrast to current times!

PERSPECTIVE ON TRADE; EUROPE DRAWS AN ELECTRONIC CURTAIN; BARRIERS TO U.S.

<P>
 After seven tortuous years, Congress has four months to sort through the pile 
of compromises and issues shoved under the rug in reaching the 11th-hour 
closure on the Uruguay Round of GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade). Sticky sectors such as agriculture, textiles and financial services 
involving some of Congress' own pet subsidies and trade barriers can be tidied 
up relatively quickly with interpretations that suit the national interest. But 
no amount of housekeeping is going to smooth over the lump of audio-visual 
issues -- movies, television, popular music -- that the Europeans exempted from 
the most liberalizing trade agreement in history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration was right not to settle for a bad compromise in 
what the Department of Commerce calculates as America's second-largest net 
export earner. But neither the Administration nor Congress can afford to let 
Brussels sweep the so-called audio-visual issues under the trade carpet for 
very long. 
</P>
<P>
 If Europe's audio-visual policies were a simple matter of preserving "culture" 
or even subsidizing it, few would begrudge their behavior. Virtually every 
nation, including the United States, uses government funds to promote or 
preserve elements of culture through the audio-visual arts. However, under the 
terms of the European Union's (formerly the European Community) broadcast 
directive, countries are required to implement a timetable for policing and 
restricting "where practicable" the showing of programs with less than a 
majority "European content" in production, talent or locations. This leaves the 
EU bureaucrats in Brussels having to defend an Italian clone of "Wheel of 
Fortune" as preserving European culture while they block "Amadeus" as part of 
the Hollywood cultural invasion. The reasoning? Despite the clearly European 
focus of the award-winning fantasy about Mozart, its funding was not primarily 
European. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, only the French were aggressive enforcers of the restrictions 
on U.S. entertainment. Indeed, the millions of francs they fined the very 
popular independent TV channel (Canal Cinq) for showing too many American 
programs was in large measure the reason for its sudden demise. On the heels of 
the GATT agreement, France has now ordered that 40% of the music aired on 
French radio stations be French in origin, the other 60% European. So much for 
Cole Porter. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Even less restrictive countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany are 
scrambling to demonstrate that they are taking specific actions to restrict 
U.S. programming in preparation for October's five-year review of 
implementation of the 1989 broadcast directive. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term stakes in audio-visual policies are much higher than the very 
considerable trade interests of our television, film and record industries. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, technical advances in digitalization and signal compression are 
fast turning film, video and sound into the "software" that feeds not only 
traditional TV and movie fare but also the exploding markets in computer, 
telecommunication, cable and satellite industries -- industries that are 
becoming critical conduits to competitiveness in developing as well as 
developed countries. If cultural sovereignty can be used by governments to 
restrict trade in entertainment, this same principle can be used to restrict 
and therefore manage information in all its forms. To limit their tradability 
under the guise of cultural sovereignty casts a potentially long shadow over 
global free trade extending far beyond America's own economic self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important in the long run than multi-industry economic stakes are 
the basic political principles involved. The citizens of Europe and others 
whose governments attempt to restrict access to audio-visual services are being 
denied basic rights and freedom of choice. Indeed, the EU broadcast directive 
is in direct violation of basic tenets adopted by all member countries in the 
founding days of the United Nations (and later reaffirmed in the Convention of 
Europe). Article 19 of the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights not only accepts 
the basic human "right to freedom of opinion and expression" but explicitly 
states: "This right includes the freedom to hold opinions without interference 
and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media 
regardless of frontiers." 
</P>
<P>
 Most citizens of Europe undoubtedly would recoil at the thought that they have 
allowed their governments to promote what is tantamount to economic "jamming." 
Unlike the Soviet electronic jamming of the Cold War era, which attempted to 
block news and information broadcast from the West, the Europeans are "jamming" 
the airwaves with trade and regulatory restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 30 countries in other parts of the world agreeing to some form 
of liberalization in audio-visual trade, even the powerful Hollywood lobby is 
likely to support congressional approval despite the failure in reaching 
agreement with Europe. But given the Clinton Administration's avowed commitment 
to promoting both human rights and economic competitiveness, it cannot afford 
to merely come home and declare victory. It must commence a strategy that will 
engage the governments of Europe in recognizing that the rights of their 
citizens to information and ideas are as precious as any trade agreement in 
advancing global prosperity and growth.

RUSSIA HASN'T BEEN 'LOST' . . . YET; U.S. POLICY: INSTEAD OF OVERREACTING TO 
THE ZHIRINOVSKY THREAT, STEP BACK AND CRAFT A LONG-TERM PEACE STRATEGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELOR STURUA, Melor Sturua is a political columnist for Izvestia and 
visiting professor at the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey 
Institute of Public Affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Russians have a proverb: A muzhik (peasant) doesn't make the sign of the 
cross until he hears the thunder. The same holds true for the American 
political Establishment: It crosses itself only after the thunder has struck -- 
when the lightning has already done its damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at all of the so-called Great Debates on foreign policy: As a rule, they 
are conducted in past terms: Who lost Eastern Europe (the Yalta betrayal)? Who 
lost China? Cuba? And so on. Now we can smell in the air a new "who lost" 
debate, this time about Russia. And the role of thunder is being played by 
victorious ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody curses him, all right. But at the same time, there is a strong 
feeling that if Zhirinovsky didn't already exist, he'd have to be invented 
because everybody benefits from him, even if they won't acknowledge it. Boris 
Yeltsin uses the Zhirinovsky bugaboo to extract political and economic 
concessions from the West, and from the United States in particular. The 
Eastern European countries have converted the fascist buffoon into a Trojan 
horse they hope to ride into NATO. In short, everybody is happy with 
Zhirinovsky's picturesque existence, including the movers and shakers of 
American foreign policy (Strobe Talbott's elevation to the No. 2 position at 
the State Department is the latest example of this phenomenon). 
</P>
<P>
 But let's stop playing with Zhirinovsky's persona for a moment and remember 
that the future of mankind is at stake. History is not dead yet, and there are 
mind-boggling questions before us: Must the United States ease pressure on 
Yeltsin to reform Russia's economy as fast as possible? Must the United States 
put more emphasis on "therapy" and less on "shock"? Will de-emphasizing rapid 
economic change in favor of maintaining living standards save Russia from 
fascism and communism? Is the notorious "Partnership for Peace" just a 
euphemism for a new Munich, this time sacrificing the emerging democracies of 
Eastern Europe on the shaky altar of the old-fashioned Great Power condominium? 
Will the NATO membership of some Eastern European countries and some former 
Soviet republics strengthen or weaken democracy? And where does that leave the 
states not blessed with a NATO invitation?  
</P>
<P>
 If we don't have the right answers for them, and at the right time, these 
thunderous questions can ignite lightning answers without giving us even time 
to cross our bleeding hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 We are asking Hamlet's questions. And what does President Clinton say? "We're 
going to work hard to try to make everybody feel good about this approach" 
(Partnership for Peace). But trying to make everybody feel good is just 
courting disaster. Politics is not lovemaking. Unfortunately. 
</P>
<P>
 I certainly don't feel good. In fact, I feel afraid -- afraid because I 
already smell the very seductive aroma of appeasement in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Time is very precious and is running out. History, which is very much alive, 
gives us one more chance to have a productive great debate. I suggest as a 
venue the House Foreign Affairs Committee, so ably and wisely chaired by Rep. 
Lee Hamilton. I suggest that he invite the widest possible spectrum of 
political scientists and economists, from the scholars who, like Francis 
Fukuyama, proclaim the end of history and promise us the Golden Age, to those 
who, like me, fear a new Stone Age. To make these hearings as representative as 
possible, I suggest the participation of four waves of the best minds: first, 
American scholars, then Russian emigre scholars, then Russian scholars, and, 
finally, scholars from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace is too precious a commodity to leave it solely to diplomats and 
politicians. We scholars are maybe more irresponsible than diplomats, but, on 
the other hand, we are more independent and our ambitions are better suited for 
productive brainstorming. Maybe we don't know how to cook, but we sure know how 
to stir. The fateful decisions that affect the future of our civilization 
cannot depend on such trivial circumstance as who is President Yeltsin's tennis 
partner or President Clinton's former college roommate.

COLUMN LEFT/ DONELLA H. MEADOWS: HOW WE TALK CAN DETERMINE HOW WE LIVE; SOME 
WORDS ILLUMINATE SHORT- TERM GAIN, DISTRACTING ATTENTION FROM LONG-TERM 
CONSEQUENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in the 1970s when my feminist friends said they felt excluded by the word 
man -- as in "the future of man" -- I thought they were making a fuss over 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was easy enough to say people or humanity instead of man , so I did, 
and gradually my gender-deafness turned into sensitivity. I feel more a part of 
the future of humanity than the future of man. The words policeman and workman 
and congressman screen me out, while police and worker and member of Congress, 
however awkward, invite me in. 
</P>
<P>
 Words make a difference. Every public-relations person knows that, every 
general who calls killing civilians "collateral damage," every industrialist 
who is "creating jobs" rather than making profits and "downsizing" rather than 
uncreating jobs. The builders of garbage incinerators insist on calling them 
"trash-to-energy converters." The unborn person is a baby to those who want to 
prohibit abortion, but a fetus to those who want abortion to be legal. Words 
exclude or include, they wound or heal, they clarify or obfuscate or disguise. 
They set up patterns in our minds, and those patterns cause us to act, or not. 
Follow the rise and fall of words -- glasnost, crack, e-mail , junk bonds, 
biotechnology -- and you key into the evolution (or devolution) of history. 
Change words and you can change history.  
</P>
<P>
 Which is why the word sustainability is so important. I work in a global 
community in which sustainability is the central word, the highest value, the 
guide to the future of humankind. But it's not a word you hear in the news. The 
words sustainability, sustainable development or sustainable growth are 
beginning to bounce around the world, but they often cause confusion, 
especially in high places.  
</P>
<P>
 Sustainability . The ability to sustain, to keep going, to provide for the 
long term. Meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of 
future generations to meet their needs -- that's how the World Commission on 
Environment and Development defined it in 1987. In practical terms, 
sustainability means not cutting a forest faster than it grows, not pumping 
ground water faster than it recharges, not catching fish before they've had a 
chance to breed, not dumping wastes faster than nature can absorb or recycle 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 Just as the use of gender-neutral language makes you aware of how words can be 
used to put down women, the use of sustainability language tunes you in to 
words that illuminate short-term gain while distracting attention from 
long-term consequence. "That's progress," we say, as we pave over fertile 
fields. Everyone knows you can't stop progress. "Technology" is a magic 
incantation that will clean up any mess, and if technology won't do it, "the 
market" will. The most powerful, thought-stopping word of all is growth.  
</P>
<P>
 Growth is our cultural icon, our mantra, our grail. We sift through the 
economic indicators, looking, hoping, for signs of growth. We support the North 
American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
because they will bring growth. Environmental regulations should not be allowed 
to slow growth. Growth of what? For whom? How long can we keep it up? What will 
we do when it's over? Can we be sure it's harmless?  
</P>
<P>
 It is a step toward precise thinking to say man when you mean a male, woman 
when you mean a female and person or human when you mean both -- and it's a way 
to root out prejudicial thoughts that are no less oppressive for being only 
semiconscious. Similarly, it's a step toward precision and sustainability to 
say growth when you mean an increase in physical size and development when you 
mean, as the dictionary says, "to realize the potentialities of, to bring to a 
fuller, greater, or better state." Development means to get better, growth 
means to get bigger.  
</P>
<P>
 That kind of precision dethrones growth and turns it into something you might 
be either for or against, depending on what is growing. Growth of food for the 
hungry is good, as long as the Earth can support it. Growth of fishing boats in 
an overfished territory is a disaster. A light bulb that gives the same light 
using one-eighth as much electricity means negative growth worth celebrating.  
</P>
<P>
 The planet Earth develops, diversifies, evolves. It does not grow. The same 
must ultimately be true of the human economy, if it is to be sustained on and 
by this planet. Sustainable growth is neither desirable nor possible. But 
sustainable development, providing more services to human beings while putting 
less load on the environment, is entirely possible, if we develop the words to 
talk about it, understand it, act on it and bring it into being.

HORSE RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; IT'S STILL STRUB, BUT SERIES IS JUST NOT WHAT IT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Mel Stute can speak from experience about how tough it is to sweep the 
three-race Strub series at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Stute went into the 1986-87 series with Snow Chief, the Preakness winner and 
champion 3-year-old colt of 1986, but he was unable to win the first two legs. 
He finished second behind Ferdinand in the Malibu Stakes and lost to Variety 
Road and Broad Brush in the San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those first two races might have been too short for my horse, but then he won 
the big one," Stute said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1 1/4-mile Strub, Snow Chief beat Ferdinand by a neck, for the last 
major victory of his career, with Broad Brush finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the days. The Strub series brought together archrivals Ferdinand 
and Snow Chief, respective winners of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, and 
when Broad Brush shipped to California from Maryland, Santa Anita got the horse 
that had finished third in both of those races, too. Even Variety Road, the 
California-bred, was no piker. He raced until he was a 9-year-old, retiring 
with just under $1 million in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Strub series is flimsy by comparison. From a thin crop of 
3-year-olds -- Prairie Bayou, who died because of injuries suffered in the 
Belmont Stakes, will probably be voted division champion -- the seven-furlong 
Malibu on Dec. 26 had only one starter who ran in a Triple Crown race, and 
Sunday's field for the 1 1/8-mile San Fernando is not any deeper. Diazo, fifth 
in the Kentucky Derby and winner by a half-length in the Malibu, will be 
favored, and other than River Special, a leading 2-year-old in 1982, the six or 
seven other starters are belatedly trying to build their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Stute will have a horse in the field, and he figures that Bat Eclat's 
chances are as good as anybody's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he ran a big race in the Malibu," Stute said. "He closed a lot of 
ground. This race is longer and I think he's capable of doing a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight lengths behind and in last place after half a mile in the Malibu, Bat 
Eclat finished fourth, beaten by less than four lengths. The 3-year-old 
gelding, a California-bred like Snow Chief, has taken a left turn under Stute, 
returning to dirt for the Strub series after a campaign last year that was 
mostly on grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Bred and owned by Robert and Barbara Walter, Bat Eclat was sent to Stute last 
fall to run on grass in the California Cup Mile, but because of a technicality 
-- he had been scratched by a veterinarian from a race at Bay Meadows the week 
before -- he was not permitted to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after the Cal Cup, Stute ran Bat Eclat for an $80,000 claiming price 
at a mile on grass, and he won with a closing rush, paying $67.40. His time of 
1:34 was the same as Megan's Interco's winning clocking in the Cal Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Sticking to the turf, Bat Eclat won two allowance races before running in the 
Malibu, which was his first dirt assignment since last winter at Golden Gate 
Fields, where Noble Hay II did the training. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited about his chances and we'll be down for the race," Barbara 
Walter said Thursday. The Walters own Vine Hill Ranch, a 550-acre spread 60 
miles north of San Francisco, where Battonier, Bat Eclat's sire, and their 
three other stallions stand, along with dozens of broodmares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walters bought Battonier, winner of the 1978 Illinois Derby, for $60,000 
from a Preston Madden dispersal, and from his first crop in California they got 
Charmonnier, who was 28-1 when he beat Best Pal, at 2-5, in the 1991 Cal Cup 
Classic at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bat Eclat, Charmonnier is a gelding. Barbara Walter said that her 
husband, despite being a prominent breeder, still gelds many of their horses 
because he believes that there is an oversupply of stallions in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have a lot going for you to win important races," said Robert 
Walter, who bought Vine Hill 10 years ago. "You need a superior horse, you need 
money and patience, and you've got to have all the luck in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlucky has been River Special, who won the Del Mar Futurity, the Norfolk at 
Santa Anita and the Hollywood Futurity in 1992, then missed most of last year, 
including the Triple Crown, because of an injury. The colt was a model of 
consistency before his last-place finish in the Malibu, and will have to 
improve by more than 13 lengths against Diazo on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Diazo, winning the first two legs of the Strub series is as difficult 
as winning all three. The series is limited to horses foaled four years before. 
Since it began in 1952, only five horses -- Round Table, Hillsdale, Ancient 
Title, Spectacular Bid and Precisionist -- have swept the races, and other than 
that quintet only five have put victories together in the Malibu and San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Precisionist's sweep in 1985, the only horse to win the first two races 
has been On The Line, in 1988. He then ran third, behind Alysheba and Candi's 
Gold, in the Strub Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Belmonte is the last jockey to win the San Fernando in successive years. 
Starting in 1969, Belmonte won the stake three consecutive times, counting his 
dead heat with Autobiography against Triple Bend in 1972. . . . Chris McCarron, 
who won last year's San Fernando with Bertrando, will be riding Zignew in the 
$200,000 race Sunday. . . . Bill Shoemaker, who trains Diazo, was Spectacular 
Bid's jockey when they swept the Strub series in 1980. Shoemaker rode San 
Fernando winners eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasant Tango, unraced since his fifth-place finish in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic, is a San Fernando probable. . . . Another race on Sunday's card is the 
filly division of the California Breeders' Champion Stakes. . . . On Monday's 
Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Santa Anita will run the $150,000 Santa Monica 
Handicap for fillies and mares. . . . Winning her third in a row, Phoenician 
Miss rallied under Alex Solis to win Thursday's feature by a half- length over 
Pro or Con's Girl. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Anita's three-race series for 4-year-old fillies, Mamselle Bebette, 
who has already won the La Brea Stakes, will run against eight rivals Saturday 
in the $100,000 El Encino. Mamselle Bebette, who races for John Forsythe, drew 
the rail, and outside her, in order, for the 1 1/16-mile race will be Island 
Orchid, Vinista, Sensational Eyes, Alyshena, Golden Klair, Tricky Princess, 
Stalcreek and Supah Gem. The series finale is the La Canada on Feb. 5. Taisez 
Vous swept the races in 1978, as did Mitterand in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Peteski, the Canadian horse of the year for 1993, has been retired to stud. 
Winless in the United States, Peteski beat Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero and 
Belmont winner Colonial Affair in the Molson Million at Woodbine. A training 
injury resulted in Peteski being scratched from the Breeders' Cup Classic at 
Santa Anita in November. . . . Aqueduct, suffering from a horse shortage, is 
combining televised races from Gulfstream Park this season to beef up its 
cards. In 35-degree weather Thursday in New York, Aqueduct ran all seven of its 
live races, but all but one of the races in Florida, where the temperature was 
80, had to be canceled when the Gulfstream jockeys voted not to ride. The 
riders said that the Gulfstream track was too muddy after six consecutive days 
of rain.

FIXED HUBBLE'S SHARP PHOTOS CAUSE ELATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ebullient astronomers released the first sharp, focused images from the 
refurbished Hubble Space Telescope on Thursday as evidence that the astronauts 
who carried out five days of dramatic spacewalks to repair the telescope last 
month had accomplished their goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented detail in NASA photos of a spiral galaxy, a dense nursery of 
young stars and other distant celestial objects was proof that after three 
years of national ridicule and a costly repair mission, the orbital observatory 
is performing up to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble with Hubble is over," said Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, the Maryland 
Democrat who heads the Senate subcommittee responsible for financing the space 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a photograph of the spiral galaxy over her head like a trophy, she 
said: "We will be able to do 21st Century science." 
</P>
<P>
 NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the telescope's performance exceeded 
the agency's "wildest dreams." Presidential science adviser John Gibbons, 
calling the repairs "a superb example of the new NASA," made it clear that what 
the White House liked best about the rejuvenated telescope was that it had been 
fixed on time and within budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched three years ago, the Hubble Space Telescope was designed to see 
farther into the universe than any telescope ever built, using wavelengths 
blocked to astronomers on Earth. After it reached orbit, engineers determined 
that its primary mirror had been ground to the wrong prescription, a flaw that 
the manufacturer apparently had concealed from the space agency, according to 
congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 During an 11-day shuttle mission last month, a crew of seven astronauts 
installed a set of corrective optics designed to compensate for the Hubble's 
flawed mirror and also replaced the telescope's workhorse wide-field camera 
with a more sophisticated set of four cameras built by the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA flight controllers have not deployed all of the telescope's new 
instruments, but they said the new camera and corrective optics have been 
tested extensively since the repair mission and they are certain that the 
telescope is performing properly.  
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time," senior JPL scientist John Trauger said, "we know we can 
begin doing the kind of science you can only do with a telescope like this 
above Earth's atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 During Hubble's planned 15 years of operation, astronomers will scrutinize 
objects as close as asteroids, comets and planets within the solar system and 
as distant as quasars at the farthest and oldest reaches of the universe. More 
than 1,200 astronomers are scheduled to use the telescope this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers say the refocused Hubble will be able to provide final proof about 
the existence of black holes and, over the next three years, will allow them to 
calculate the true age of the universe. This spring, astronomers plan to use 
the Hubble to search for a black hole at the heart of galaxy M87.  
</P>
<P>
 Prior to a news conference Thursday, NASA officials treated Hubble's "first 
light" pictures -- the name given to an observatory's initial photos -- with 
the kind of secrecy usually associated with the rollout of a new car in 
Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
 Once the images were made public, agency officials in Washington and engineers 
at JPL could barely contain their elation, competing for superlatives to 
describe the new optics. 
</P>
<P>
 The corrected telescope, they said, was powerful enough to pick out a firefly 
8,500 miles away; to see "with clarity" objects 12 billion light-years from 
Earth.  
</P>
<P>
 "These corrected images are as perfect as engineering can achieve and the laws 
of physics will allow," said James H. Crocker, a Hubble scientist at the Space 
Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.  
</P>
<P>
 The photos released Thursday were taken with the camera designed by JPL. They 
included: 
</P>
<P>
 * An image of Eta Carinae, one of the most massive and luminous stars in the 
night sky, surrounded by an expanding ruby red shell of high-speed stellar 
gases. The refurbished Hubble detected the structure of the material closest to 
the star -- of intense interest to astronomers -- for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 * An image of the heart of a spiral galaxy called M100 in the Virgo cluster, 
showing that the telescope can resolve relatively small objects in a galaxy 
tens of millions of light-years away. The resolution is high enough to enable 
astronomers to make the crucial measurements necessary to gauge the size of the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
 * An image of a star nursery inside a giant cloud of gas in a neighboring 
galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud, revealing more than 3,000 stars in 
its central star cluster. In earlier, blurred Hubble images, astronomers could 
discern only several hundred.

MISTRIAL DECLARED IN CASE AGAINST ERIK MENENDEZ; COURTS: JUDGE RULES AFTER 
JURORS AGAIN SAY THEY ARE HOPELESSLY DEADLOCKED. SOME HELD OUT FOR FIRST-DEGREE 
MURDER CONVICTIONS. BROTHER'S JURY CONTINUES DELIBERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mistrial was declared Thursday in the murder trial of Erik Menendez after 
his jury reported it could not reach verdicts in the case that began as a 
simple whodunit but became dominated by impassioned claims of fear and 
molestation within the gates of a Beverly Hills mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg declared the mistrial 
Thursday afternoon after jurors said they could not reach unanimous agreement 
on any of the counts against Erik Menendez, 23, who, along with his older 
brother Lyle, was charged in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their 
multimillionaire parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In notes to the judge, the jury's foreman indicated that the panel had been 
divided on the emotional case from the moment deliberations began three weeks 
ago -- and that neither side had budged. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg sealed the jury's vote and ordered the 12 members not to discuss 
their deliberations in public until a second jury has completed its 
consideration of the charges against Lyle Menendez, 26. 
</P>
<P>
 But a short hearing in court revealed that some jurors held out to the end for 
first-degree murder convictions, while others embraced the bold defense that 
portrayed the brothers as the true victims in the Menendez household. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, clearly disappointed, declined comment on the mistrial. But Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti had vowed earlier in the week to retry either Menendez 
brother for murder if there were no verdicts in the six-month trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many viewed the deadlock as a victory for the defense, Erik 
Menendez's lead attorney, Leslie Abramson, measured her words after the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider it a victory. A victory would be if my client was free," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She vowed to defend Erik Menendez, who remains in custody without bail, a 
second time if possible. "I do not believe any jury will ever convict Erik 
Menendez of first-degree murder," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik and Lyle Menendez, portrayed by the media as tennis-playing playboys who 
enjoyed the good life with the help of family credit cards, were not arrested 
until seven months after the bodies of their parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and 
Kitty Menendez, 47, were discovered in the TV room of their home. The brothers 
encouraged authorities' belief that the killings likely were tied to Jose 
Menendez's dealings as head of a Van Nuys entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
 After the brothers were arrested, prosecutors contended that they killed out 
of hatred and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 At trial, the brothers admitted the slayings, but testified that they fired in 
self-defense, recounting years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that claim that polarized spectators -- including a nationwide TV 
audience -- into two groups: believers and skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
 The same dynamic apparently has been at work in the jury rooms. Two juries 
were selected to hear the case because some evidence was admitted against only 
one brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreman of the Erik Menendez jury, in a note sent to Weisberg early 
Thursday, said the panel had tried hard to break the deadlock it first reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But it just could not be done, according to the foreman, a dean at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, we have become more entrenched in our positions," his note said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg had given jurors a range of verdicts in the slaying of each parent -- 
from first-degree murder, which carries a potential death penalty, down to 
involuntary manslaughter, which means a prison term as short as two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During its 21st day of deliberations Thursday, the jury for Lyle Menendez 
asked for legal definitions relating to the lesser manslaughter charges. 
Although it began its work before the Erik Menendez jury, that panel has sent 
no notes indicating a deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Erik Menendez jury signaled its problems Monday, Weisberg ordered 
members to keep trying. Late Tuesday, the foreman sent a note with three 
questions about complex legal terms, suggesting that the jury was striving to 
break its deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the jury entered its 19th day of deliberations, the note Thursday 
morning quashed hope of a breakthrough. "Since our last report to you, we have 
been unable to move closer to any agreement," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg gave jurors new forms designed not so much to get a verdict, but to 
possibly pare down the charges that would be considered in a retrial -- by 
eliminating first-degree murder, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Relieving them of the more difficult chore of agreeing on one verdict, he 
asked the jurors to consider the question of guilt or innocence for each 
possible charge separately. If the jury was unanimous in acquitting Erik 
Menendez of first-degree murder, but remained deadlocked on the lesser charges, 
the prosecution then would have been foreclosed from seeking a first-degree 
conviction at a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
 After just a few hours more behind closed doors, however, the foreman sent out 
another note. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, at 3:40 p.m., jurors filed somberly into the courtroom, some still 
clutching their notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a packed court -- so filled that spectators had to draw lots to get a 
seat -- Weisberg read aloud the new note: "We are unable to reach unanimous 
verdicts." 
</P>
<P>
 He asked the foreman if there was any "reasonable probability" of a verdict. 
The foreman said no. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg then asked all 12 jurors the same question. Even before he finished 
the question, jurors were shaking their heads. He was met with a chorus: "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of following the usual routine of asking the foreman in open court 
about the results of votes taken in the jury room, Weisberg said he would ask 
the foreman to prepare a form listing any votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "These numbers here, this is how it's been the last three weeks?" Weisberg 
asked, keeping the figures to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty close," the foreman replied. 
</P>
<P>
 At that, Weisberg said: "The court finds the jury is hopelessly deadlocked." 
The judge scheduled a Feb. 28 hearing to set a new trial date. 
</P>
<P>
 The declaration of a mistrial, legal experts said, made winners of the defense 
-- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "One ought to remember the prosecution characterized this case as an open and 
shut, slam-dunk, first-degree murder with special circumstances," said Peter 
Aranella, a criminal law professor at UCLA. "So that makes this clearly a 
defense victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Pugsley, a Southwestern University criminal law professor, said a 
retrial will pose problems for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see enormous pragmatic difficulties in mounting a full-scale second 
prosecution, including financial and community resources," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead attorneys Abramson and Jill Lansing, who represents Lyle Menendez, are on 
record as saying that the Menendez estate, once estimated as worth $14 million, 
is virtually gone. "It remains to be seen whether they're willing to work for 
publicity from now on," Pugsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson also cited that factor outside court, saying she would have to be 
paid by the county at a retrial. "I can't go bankrupt in order to do it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to county records, two other defense lawyers were paid through the 
trial with public funds, routine for a death penalty case. Michael Burt earned 
$246,625 through Dec. 22 while Marcia Morrissey was paid $130,336. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors will have to muster support for a costly second go-round. One 
alternative would be a plea bargain, an arrangement Abramson said she might be 
open to -- if prosecutors agreed to merely a manslaughter conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, you have to ask yourself: Is there the public stomach for this kind 
of spectacle again?" Pugsley said. "For lack of a better word, this show." 
</P>
<P>
 The show was on full display Thursday. As attorneys left the courthouse, one 
TV cameraman fell to the ground amid the mob chasing Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg cautioned the Lyle Menendez jury to ignore the crush of media, saying 
there was likely to be news about "the co-defendant." He admonished jurors "not 
to be exposed" to any of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The note sent Thursday by the foreman of the Lyle Menendez jury, a postal 
worker, asked three questions suggesting that the panel was debating fine 
points of the law relating to manslaughter, and the defense contention that the 
brothers believed their lives were in danger when they blasted away at their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The first question said some jurors interpreted the instructions to mean that 
if a person kills in the "honest but unreasonable belief that he's in imminent 
peril," then that "excludes malice and therefore murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, malice must be present for a killing to become murder. Without 
it, a killing can only be manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors asked the judge if their interpretation of the law was correct. Yes, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also asked: "If a person . . . harbors malice . . . does the fact that he 
believed he was defending himself negate the malice aforethought?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the judge answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the note asked if an "honest but unreasonable belief" in imminent 
harm "in fact holds (the defendant) accountable to voluntary or involuntary 
manslaughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Weisberg answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Amy Wallace contributed to this report. Jury Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The jury weighing murder charges against Erik Menendez signaled its stalemate 
this week in three notes from the foreman. Van Nuys Superior Court Judge 
Stanley M. Weisberg asked the panel to continue deliberating after the first 
two, then declared a mistrial Thursday afternoon. Here is the text of the 
notes: 
</P>
<P>
 MONDAY 
</P>
<P>
 "We are deadlocked. Positions have essentially not changed after three weeks 
of discussion and debate. I see no hope for reaching agreement on any of the 
counts." 
</P>
<P>
 THURSDAY MORNING 
</P>
<P>
 "We remain deadlocked. Since our last report to you, we have been unable to 
move closer to agreement on any of the counts. If anything, we have become more 
entrenched in our positions. A poll taken this morning shows the jury believes 
there is no reasonable probability of our reaching a verdict or verdicts 
without violence to our individual judgments." 
</P>
<P>
 THURSDAY AFTERNOON 
</P>
<P>
 "We are unable to reach unanimous verdicts as to the charges in counts 1, 2 
and 3 and therefore have not signed any verdict forms."

COLUMN ONE; CAUGHT IN FALLOUT OF WASTE WAR; THE WARD VALLEY STANDOFF LEAVES THE 
STATE'S NUCLEAR MEDICINE INDUSTRY WITH NO PLACE TO DUMP ITS RADIOACTIVE TRASH. 
SOME FEAR THAT ACCIDENTS, RESEARCH CUTS AND HIGHER DRUG COSTS COULD RESULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind stairwells, beneath parking garages, in hundreds of spare rooms in 
hospitals and biotechnology laboratories across California, a slow but steady 
accumulation of radioactive refuse is giving a new urgency to the prolonged 
debate over how to dispose of nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to now, that debate has focused on the wisdom of burying nuclear power 
plant debris -- largely plutonium, with its 50,000-year half-life -- at Ward 
Valley in the Mojave Desert 20 miles from the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 Under heavy pressure from anti-nuclear activists, the Clinton Administration 
has put the Ward Valley project on hold by indefinitely postponing transfer of 
the property to California. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the decade-long standoff over Ward Valley has done more than deprive 
the nuclear power industry of a guaranteed sanctuary for spent plutonium. It 
has meant that California's research hospitals and biotech industry have no 
place to ship their radioactive trash -- the syringes used to treat terminal 
cancer patients with pain-killing radioisotopes, the residue from compounds 
used in AIDS therapy, or the carcasses of lab animals shot full of experimental 
radionuclides. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, experts warn, a crisis awaits the industry. Left unresolved, they 
say, the problem of what to do with nuclear waste could drive up the cost of 
certain drugs, lead to a reduction in medical research and put a damper on 
California's biotech industry -- one of the few bright spots during the state's 
protracted recession. 
</P>
<P>
 As the metal drums containing the waste multiply, the people responsible for 
its safekeeping are beginning to worry about the potential for accidents, 
vandalism or carelessness. Contamination by this low-level waste could pose an 
increased risk of cancer and infections. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 2,300 licensed users, big and small, of radioactive material 
throughout California, about half devoted to medicine or biomedical research. 
Virtually all of them generate some form of waste. For years, they were able to 
send long-lived waste to burial sites out of state. But that luxury is fast 
disappearing as long-distance disposal costs rise astronomically and as dumps 
in Washington state, Nevada and South Carolina close their gates to outsiders. 
Increasingly, users are being forced to store the material on their own 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuclear medicine was pioneered in California nearly 60 years ago when 
radioactive phosphorus was first used successfully to treat leukemia. Today, 
nearly 12 million Americans are given radioactive material to diagnose or treat 
illness every year. California's biotech industry leads the world in the 
marketing of radioactive drugs for the treatment of AIDS, cancer and a host of 
immunological disorders and infectious diseases. California companies account 
for more than half of the $6 billion in revenues generated by U.S. biotech 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many of these companies are in a scramble to find places to store the 
waste of nuclear medicine, most of which was slated to be dumped in desert 
trenches at Ward Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have sufficient capacity to store on site," said Bruce Wallace, head of 
environmental health and safety at Amgen Inc., of Thousand Oaks, the nation's 
largest biotech company. "But nothing we can build here will match a Ward 
Valley in terms of safety and stability." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the Ward Valley site fear the possibility of plutonium leaking 
from the dump and making its way into the Colorado River. Led by Sen. Barbara 
Boxer (D-Calif.), they are promoting the idea of an alternative. The leading 
candidate is an above-ground storage facility that could take a big chunk of 
the medical waste but would not be suitable for plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 However, prominent representatives of nuclear medicine reject the idea, 
arguing that because of its longevity, much of the waste they produce should be 
buried in a place like Ward Valley, which they think is safe for all forms of 
nuclear waste. They also worry that a search for an alternative site would bog 
down in yet another protracted battle with anti-nuclear groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't afford another 10 years of delays," said Carol Marcus, associate 
director of nuclear medicine at Los Angeles County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
"We can't afford another one year of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to see 55-gallon drums of this stuff toppling over in alleyways? . . 
. Because that's where we're headed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually none of the nuclear material used in hospitals or commercial 
laboratories compares with plutonium in terms of life span or toxicity. Much of 
the medical waste loses its radioactivity after a few days of storage and can 
be flushed safely down the drain. But there are a number of isotopes commonly 
used in hospitals and research facilities that take years and, in a few cases, 
centuries, to decay to a benign state. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting rid of that stuff is the challenge bedeviling practitioners of nuclear 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in West Los Angeles, Donna L. Earley, director 
of radiation and environmental safety, said she is forced to hold long-lived 
waste that she is not licensed to store by the state Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "My license won't allow anything with more than a 90-day half-life," Earley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 (Half-life is the time in which a radioactive substance loses half its 
radioactivity. Generally, a radioactive substance remains radioactive for 10 
times its half-life.)  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm breaking the law keeping tritium (12.3-year half-life) and carbon-14 
(5,730-year half-life) because I have no place to send it," Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are commonly used isotopes. Carbon-14 helps in the detection of 
infections, including AIDS, in blood banks. 
</P>
<P>
 One alternative for Earley and others is to cut back on research employing 
long-lived isotopes, and that, they say, is a real possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Earley said researchers at Cedars are deep into a 10-year study that tracks 
the effectiveness of drugs designed to dissolve blood clots in heart attack 
victims. The research involves the injection of five isotopes into laboratory 
pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Once dead, the radioactive pigs must be refrigerated until they can be placed 
in sealed drums and buried. Like any animal remains, the pigs cannot be stored 
long, even in refrigerators, before they begin to rot. Besides the stench and 
normal health hazards associated with decaying flesh, there is the potential 
for radioactive gases escaping from the carcasses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Until last January, Cedars sent its waste to a radioactive waste dump in 
Washington. Then that dump was closed to outsiders. With no place to dispose of 
the pigs, Earley does not know whether the research project will have to be 
altered or abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The storage problem is particularly acute at UC San Francisco, where 
radioisotopes play a vital role in one of the nation's largest AIDS research 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ara Tahmassion, the university's director of environmental health 
and safety, his office is spending 40% of its budget on waste disposal. Those 
costs have doubled in the past two years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he said, storage space on campus has shrunk to almost nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't get Ward Valley, I can store up to four months before I run out 
of space," Tahmassion said. At that point, he said, the university may have no 
option but to limit the use of radioisotopes.  
</P>
<P>
 There are many hospitals in the state that are not feeling the same pinch. 
Myron Wollin, the radiation safety officer for seven Southern California Kaiser 
Foundation hospitals, said those institutions use exclusively short-lived 
isotopes and, as a result, can easily store the waste in closets. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials must cope with the risks of stockpiling longer-lived 
radioactive waste. At USC, Leo Wade, vice president for environmental safety, 
said the school anticipates setting aside 2,220 square feet of additional space 
-- enough room for a house -- to store nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The storage space, which must be properly insulated, ventilated and monitored, 
will cost about $500,000, Wade said. "Every bit of it is money that otherwise 
would go to teaching or research," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade takes a measured view of the risks involved in storing dozens of barrels 
of nuclear waste in the middle of a big city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there are huge liabilities. I think it is a small liability 
that is going to get bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like a lot of his colleagues, Wade believes that nuclear medicine has become 
an orphan in the political storm raging over the Ward Valley site. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Ward Valley's opponents concede that if it were not for the specter of 
nuclear power plant waste -- of plutonium leaching its way into the Colorado 
River -- the dump would be up and running. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the waste were solely medical and biomedical, I believe there would have 
been no fight," said Dan Hirsch, whose anti-nuclear organization Bridge the Gap 
has masterminded Ward Valley opposition for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Hirsch is working with Boxer on a proposal for an above-ground 
alternative to Ward Valley. The plan calls for segregating waste, shipping 
medically related garbage to a giant storage facility in a location yet to be 
determined. Nuclear power plants would then be forced to hold on to their 
waste, as they are doing, until a burial site other than Ward Valley is 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though both sides in the Ward Valley battle agree that the future of 
nuclear medicine should not be compromised, their history of acrimony hinders 
their ability to come up with a solution. Neither side is inclined to trust the 
other.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I believe anything that Dan Hirsch has to say?" asked Marcus at 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. "He has been fighting the nuclear industry, in one 
form or another, for 10 years that I know of. And now he wants to help us? Give 
me a break." 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch, in turn, sees the Marcus camp as a stalking horse for the nuclear 
power industry. He argues that she and other outspoken representatives of the 
biomedical community exaggerate their needs -- inflating the volume of their 
waste -- in order to make a case for Ward Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over Ward Valley alternatives may hinge on the quantity and 
longevity of biomedical waste that must be disposed of. For years, the 
proponents of Ward Valley have said that radioactive refuse from hospitals and 
laboratories represents at least one-third of the radioactivity of the waste 
destined for the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, they argue, most of the radioactivity from medical and 
biomedical waste is emitted by long-lived isotopes that belong underground. 
Above ground, they would outlive the containers in which they were stored. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch, on the other hand, said there are enough ways to reduce long-lived 
waste to make above-ground storage practical for most medical and biomedical 
refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 He said nuclear power plants, which are temporarily storing their own 
plutonium waste, could take the most toxic and durable of the biomedical waste 
products. He maintains that the federal government is now capable of recycling 
some long-lived waste, such as tritium, which accounts for most of California's 
long-lived biomedical waste. And he argues that science is continually 
providing new, non-radioactive substitutes for many of the radioisotopes used 
in research. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Horner of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and others involved in the 
disposal and regulation of nuclear waste, regard Hirsch's proposals as 
unrealistic, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Power plants would have to be licensed to receive biomedical waste," Horner 
said. With their own waste piling up on site, he said, the utilities have 
little incentive to apply for a license to take care of other people's waste. 
"They want Ward Valley built. They don't want to become Ward Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the recycling of radioactive material, industry spokesmen say they 
already do what they can afford to do and are still stuck with significant 
quantities of waste. They dispute Hirsch's claim that the U.S. Department of 
Energy is prepared to recycle their radioactive residue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials also take issue with Hirsch's argument that non-radioactive 
substitutes can substantially reduce the need for radioisotopes in medical 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists want to have access to both approaches, said Bill Larson, a past 
president of the Southern California chapter of the Health Physics Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an either-or proposition," Larson said. "Almost everybody prefers 
multiple processes when they can have them. It means more parallel paths for 
tracking the same experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Larson spoke for many in the biomedical world when he argued that above-ground 
storage of nuclear waste represents a political rather than a practical 
solution to the problems of nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost of maintenance, the risks from fire and from earthquakes are greater 
above ground," he said. "Above ground storage only makes sense if you are 
trying to cut out plutonium -- in other words, if our goal is to end nuclear 
power. I don't think you are going to get a lot of people in my profession to 
sign on to that agenda." Radioactive Materials 
</P>
<P>
 Radioactive materials, such as radioisotopes, are widely used in some branches 
of medicine, including nuclear medicine and radiation therapy. Generally, a 
radioactive substance remains radioactive for 10 times its half-life. Some of 
these radioisotopes and their medical uses include: 
</P>
<P>
 RADIOISOTOPE: Barium-133 HALF-LIFE: 10.5 years MEDICAL USE: Calibration of 
equipment used in radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 RADIOISOTOPE: Carbon-14 HALF-LIFE: 5,730 years MEDICAL USE: Research studies 
of metabolism and detection of genetic abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
 RADIOISOTOPE: Cobalt-60 HALF-LIFE: 5.3 years MEDICAL USE: Radiation therapy 
for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 RADIOISOTOPE: Iridium-192 HALF-LIFE: 73.8 days MEDICAL USE: Radiation therapy 
for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 RADIOISOTOPE: Strontium-89 HALF-LIFE: 50.5 days MEDICAL USE: Easing of cancer 
patients' pain when the disease spreads to the bones. 
</P>
<P>
 RADIOISOTOPE: Natural uranium HALF-LIFE: 4.47 billion years MEDICAL USE: Some 
dental fixtures to provide color and brightness.

WAR ON SOUTHLAND'S BIGGEST MEDFLY INFESTATION EXPANDS; AGRICULTURE: MALATHION 
WILL BE SPRAYED OVER CORONA. THREE-COUNTY QUARANTINE WIDENED TO 1,461 SQUARE 
MILES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agriculture officials on Thursday announced a massive eradication effort and a 
1,461-square-mile quarantine area across three counties to battle the largest 
infestation of the crop-ravaging Mediterranean fruit fly in Southern 
California's history. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they said aerial spraying of malathion -- which generated a 
widespread public outcry four years ago -- will begin Jan. 24 over Corona, 
where a mated female Medfly was discovered in December. The discovery of a 
Medfly in Riverside County -- outside the already targeted eradication zone -- 
could presage its spread to rich agricultural lands, state and county officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new offensive overshadows the efforts to eradicate the Medfly in 1989-90, 
when widespread aerial spraying of malathion was believed to have eliminated 
the pest from the region. 
</P>
<P>
 This outbreak once again threatens to devastate the $18-billion California 
agriculture industry. Officials in Japan -- which annually buys about $300 
million worth of California citrus and other fruit susceptible to the Medfly -- 
are threatening an embargo on that fruit, citing fear of a Medfly infestation 
there, said Henry Voss, secretary of the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture. A statewide medfly infestation could cost the state economy $900 
million annually, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being pushed by our trading partners to put a lid on this problem 
before they have to put a quarantine on us," Voss said at a news conference in 
Corona. The spread of the Medfly "has developed to a point where it is a threat 
to the economic well-being of the state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To battle the Medfly in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties, more 
than 400 million sterile Medflies will be released weekly for two years 
beginning in March. The strategy relies on female Medflies mating with the 
sterile flies, creating sterile offspring that will ultimately doom the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said there were no plans to renew aerial spraying of malathion in 
the three-county quarantine zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Because laboratories in Hawaii cannot radioactively sterilize enough Medflies 
to blanket Corona all at once, aerial spraying will be done over that city, 
Voss said. The insecticide dose will be half the strength of that used in the 
1989-90 sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona officials complained that they were given no notice of the spraying 
before Thursday's public announcement, although Riverside County supervisors 
were given advance notice as a courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona City Councilman Jeffrey Bennett said the area targeted for aerial 
spraying has a population of about 90,000, and said it was clear to him state 
officials chose his community, rather than Los Angeles, for aerial spraying 
because Corona lacks the power of larger cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles has more political clout, and I resent that," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of the news conference, Bennett said angrily: "Your project 
has failed . . . (to eradicate the Medfly). This happens every year. What the 
hell is going on?" 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1990, agricultural officials said they hoped Southern California was 
rid of the Medfly, after they had quarantined a 1,300-square-mile area, done 
widespread aerial spraying of malathion and flooded the region with sterile 
Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1991, a pregnant Medfly was discovered in a peach tree near the 
Koreatown section of Los Angeles, and through 1992 more than 200 other Medflies 
were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 At most recent count, officials said Thursday, more than 400 Medflies have 
been discovered in the region. Among the more troublesome finds was the mated 
female Medfly in a Corona grapefruit tree two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 J. R. Reynolds, a regional director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
blamed the increase in Medflies on both the transporting of fly-infested fruit 
outside quarantine areas and continued illegal importation of infested fruit 
from Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the banned Asian fruit arrives here by way of teh Canadian province of 
British Columbia, which does not have a Medfly quarantine because of its cold 
winter climate, Reynolds said. Some of the fruit is unwittingly taken to 
California by travelers, and other fruit is smuggled here for sale at grocery 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large percentage of stores are selling fruit that is illegal in the United 
States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss characterized the current Medfly campaign as "proactive" in stopping the 
insect's spread across the state. A statewide infestation, he said, would cost 
the state $900 million a year in lost trade, related jobs and the increased 
costs for pesticides by growers and backyard gardeners wanting to keep their 
plants free of Medfly maggots. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss said he was braced for opposition to the aerial spraying. "I'm sure 
people won't be jumping up and down and be happy over this," he said. Three 
helicopters will spray the malathion while flying about 500 feet above the 
ground. The helicopters will be "very intrusive," he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the larger Los Angeles Basin quarantine area already is stocked 
with sterile Medflies, he said, it would be counterproductive to spray 
malathion there. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona will be blanketed by a mist composed of 10% malathion and 90% corn 
syrup-based bait. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of malathion has been challenged because of its unknown long-term 
effects and questions of whether, at high doses, it is carcinogenic. But the 
California Department of Health Services said that a health risk assessment 
after the 1989-90 sprayings showed no significant health effects on those 
exposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people experienced mild, short-term skin irritation but "it was concluded 
that it is very unlikely malathion causes major chronic health effects such as 
cancer and birth defects," according to a statement issued by the state and the 
Malathion Public Health Effects Advisory Committee. "Concerns about eye disease 
were found to be unwarranted, and pesticide poisoning and other serious effects 
did not occur." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement acknowledged that the anger and anxiety created by aerial 
spraying of malathion, a common garden insecticide, is "an important public 
health consideration" in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss said malathion will be sprayed over Corona eight to 10 times, starting 
Jan. 24 and ending in late June. Each application will take three to four 
hours, he said. The effort will cost between $750,000 and $1 million, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the completion of the sprayings, if no Medflies are found, the existing 
2,400-acre quarantine area around Corona will be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 A multiagency task force will hold a public meeting on aerial spraying at 6 
p.m. Tuesday at the county library in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of sterile Medflies in the Los Angeles Basin quarantine area will 
continue weekly through December, 1995, and will cost about $70 million. If 
deemed successful, the quarantine would be lifted in early 1996, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The female Medfly lays its eggs in ripening or ripe fruit and the larvae feed 
on the fruit pulp, rotting it. The emerging flies can live up to four weeks in 
the summer and up to three months in the winter.

INFLATION RATE UP ONLY 2.7% IN 1993; RETAIL SALES STRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time since the mid-1980s, the nation's economy is facing the New 
Year with the best of both worlds in store -- healthy growth with low 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to government reports released Thursday, consumer prices last year 
crept up at their slowest pace in seven years, while retail sales in 1993 
posted their strongest gain since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time businesses from home builders to car makers had such a promising 
economic outlook was in 1986, when collapsing oil prices helped keep inflation 
low while the economy grew at a 3% pace, about the same as now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department reported that the widely watched consumer price index, 
held down by low energy and tobacco prices, rose only 2.7% in 1993, making the 
inflation rate over the last three years the lowest since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that national retail sales -- led 
by home furnishings, autos and other durable goods -- rose 6.2% to $2.08 
billion in 1993, a further sign that low interest rates have boosted the 
housing market and purchases of everything from building materials to 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was likely to further ease pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to 
stem inflationary pressures by raising interest rates, economists said. Some 
analysts argue that raising interest rates could derail economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has maintained that interest rates do not need to 
be raised because inflation is under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, most economists expect that the nation's gross domestic product will 
show a healthy increase of about 3% in 1993 when final figures are released 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic news is in part a validation of the Administration's policies, 
said Gene Sperling, deputy assistant to the President for Economic Policy in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hope . . . was that if we had a strong but balanced deficit-reduction 
plan, that was seen as credible by the markets, we could keep interest rates 
and inflation low, and that would spur the investment side of the economy," he 
said. "And that is what is happening: It's very much an investment-led 
recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Labor Department also reported Thursday that the number of new 
claims for state unemployment insurance benefits fell 1,000 last week to 
354,000. The fall was smaller than expected, but economists added that overall 
job trends have been encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 The national figures on inflation and sales did not make distinctions among 
regions of the country, though economists believe that recession-racked 
California continues to lag the rest of the nation in recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 But executives here believed the upturn nationally will eventually help pull 
the Golden State out of recession. Most analysts are predicting a turnaround in 
the second half of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a significant spillover to companies situated in the Southern 
California market," said George H. Benter, president of City National Bank in 
Los Angeles. "We don't see an immediate turnaround for the market here, but 
they are positive signs for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Low prices are good news not only for consumers, but for businesses. "When you 
have low inflation and high growth, it allows manufacturing companies to . . . 
provide more competitive products to the customer," said Michael C. Gibson, 
president of Moorpark-based Kavlico Corp., maker of sensors for automotive, 
aerospace and industrial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more competitive we can be when we're procuring, the more competitive we 
can be selling, and that . . . opens more markets. And that ultimately means 
more jobs," added Gibson, whose company is making a successful transition from 
defense contract work to commercial production. 
</P>
<P>
 The CPI, which edged up just 0.2% in December on a seasonally adjusted basis, 
showed the slowest growth in 1993 since a 1.1% increase in 1986. In 1992, the 
index rose 2.9%, and in 1991 it rose 3.1%, for an average rate of growth over 
the last three years of 2.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 "This three-year period (had) the slowest rate of inflation over an extended 
period, since . . . the three years ending in 1967, when the annual rate was 
2.8%," said Patrick Jackman, chief economist at the Labor Department's Bureau 
of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The inflation rate is being held in check by low energy prices, especially for 
crude oil, which are at their lowest levels in years. Such low prices are 
likely to persist through much of 1994, particularly if Iraq is allowed to 
resume shipments of oil onto world markets, Jackman said. Energy prices 
translate into transportation costs, which are passed on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The core inflation rate, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, 
rose 0.3% in December and 3.2% for the year -- the lowest level in 21 years. 
Food costs were up 2.9% for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The inflation news meant that the Fed could relax a little. On Thursday, John 
LaWare, a member of the Fed, reportedly said the central bank's current 
monetary policy would be one of "very watchful waiting."  
</P>
<P>
 But "it doesn't mean the Fed can shut down its radar," said Robert G. 
Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "The economy has 
enough strength, and inflation is sufficiently alive, that they have to be 
concerned that the next step would be a worsening of inflation." Some analysts 
expect the Fed to bump short-term rates in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The government reported that retail sales grew 0.8% in December -- to a 
seasonally adjusted $180.6 billion, 6.9% higher than sales in December, 1992. 
That was stronger than the expected 0.3% to 0.4%, and marked the ninth straight 
month of increases.

INJURY TO KERRIGAN. NO WARRANT ISSUED FOR TONYA HARDING, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
 National figure skating champion Tonya Harding's bodyguard and another man 
were arrested Thursday in Portland, Ore., and charged with conspiracy in the 
attack on Olympic rival Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Eric Eckardt, 26, the bodyguard, and Derrick Brian Smith, 29, were 
arrested and held on $20,000 bail. But the two arrests were not expected to 
close the case of one of the more bizarre attacks on a sports figure. An 
official of the Multnomah County Sheriff's Department said more arrests were 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sources said Eckardt has told authorities that Harding's former 
husband, Jeff Gillooly, asked him to arrange last week's attack on Kerrigan at 
the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Thursday that no arrest warrant was issued for Harding, who 
has denied any involvement in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a former Portland resident, moved to Phoenix about five months ago, a 
prosecutor said. Authorities did not explain what role Smith played in the 
alleged plot but Fox News reported that Smith was the getaway driver after the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt, in handcuffs, was brought to the Portland jail in an unmarked car. He 
did not answer reporters' shouted questions. Smith followed half an hour later, 
also handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC News reported that a Portland man, identified as Shane Stant, was 
suspected of being Kerrigan's attacker at Detroit's Cobo Arena. The assailant 
escaped after hitting Kerrigan with a metal baton above her right knee as she 
left a practice session. Kerrigan had to withdraw from the figure-skating 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, 23, then won the championship and was named to the U.S. Olympic team. 
The other Olympic spot normally would have gone to the second-place finisher, 
Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance, but the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. named 
Kerrigan to the team, presuming that she is able to compete in the Winter 
Olympics next month in Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, doctors in Boston said Kerrigan's injured right knee showed 
improvement after two days of physical therapy. She has refused to comment on 
the police investigation, but her father, Daniel Kerrigan, said the attention 
would not affect her Olympic performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's agent, Jerry Solomon, told "Larry King Live" on CNN: "She's doing 
great . . . . She's in the pool everyday. She's doing hydrotherapy. Her range 
of motion in her knee is almost back to full range of motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is every reason to believe she'll be OK for the Olympics physically. As 
far as the emotional and mental side, I know she'll be OK that way because she 
is very strong and she's mentally tough and she's a great fighter," Solomon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan won a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation into the attack on Kerrigan has taken local police and the 
FBI to four states and spawned a cottage industry of rumors and falsehoods. 
</P>
<P>
 When Harding's name surfaced this week in connection with the incident, she 
called the allegations ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys know me better than that," Harding said. "I had my hopes for a long 
time of competing against Nancy and proving I'm as good as her and better." 
</P>
<P>
 But within a few days, stories implicating Harding's former husband and her 
bodyguard surfaced. Harding and Gillooly were divorced Aug. 28, but reconciled 
and have lived together since October. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Harding nor Gillooly were seen publicly Thursday. They have not been 
at their Portland home since Tuesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first breaks in the case came Saturday when a woman from out of 
state called the Detroit Police Department, insisting on talking to Deputy 
Police Chief Benny Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Thursday, Napoleon said the woman told him that she had 
heard a taped conversation regarding the planned attack on Kerrigan several 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the woman identified four people and he gave the names to the FBI. The 
plot allegedly involved Eckardt, Gillooly, an Eckardt acquaintance in Phoenix 
and a Portland man who attacked Kerrigan for $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Portland, a private investigator, Gary Crowe, said the FBI 
learned of the alleged plot from a local minister, Eugene C. Saunders. Crowe 
said Saunders came to him for advice after speaking with a friend who played 
him a tape recording of men alleged to be Gillooly, Eckardt and the 
unidentified Arizona man discussing Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders, 24, was a classmate of Eckardt at Pioneer Pacific College in 
Wilsonville, Ore. Another student taking the paralegal course, Russell Reitz, 
told authorities that Eckardt asked him last week if he would be willing to 
kill someone for $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I wouldn't and then he asked me if I would break somebody's legs 
for $65,000," Reitz said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reitz refused, and went to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit police believe that they have the weapon, a collapsible metal baton, 
that was used to attack Kerrigan. A resident found it in a trash can behind the 
arena that was used for practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Schiller, executive director of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said 
Harding's participation in the Olympics would not be affected by the attack on 
Kerrigan because "there's no indication that Tonya's involved at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Figure Skating Assn. in Colorado Springs issued a statement saying it 
would not comment on speculation about the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt and Smith face up to 10 years in prison and a $100,000 fine if 
convicted on the conspiracy charge.

LITTLE BIRD, BIG SUCCESS; PLAN TO SUPPLY MORE WATER TO ORANGE COUNTY ALSO 
PROTECTS ENDANGERED BELL'S VIREO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 At first glance, the Prado Dam seems to have little connection with birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretching behind the 566-foot-tall structure fronting the Riverside Freeway 
is a broad basin -- dry and brown this time of year -- that helps supply much 
of the water for about 2 million Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 About a mile away lies a 124-acre forest of willow trees gently swaying in the 
breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 It is to this peaceful patch of forest near the border of Orange and Riverside 
counties that the least Bell's vireo -- a tiny songbird listed as endangered by 
federal and state officials -- is expected to return to nest in March, after 
wintering in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was atop this dam on the Santa Ana River that various county, state and 
federal officials gathered this week to dedicate an agreement deemed by many as 
a triumph for bird and humankind. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is wonderful," said Philip L. Anthony, president of the Orange County 
Water District, which provides water for much of Orange County. "It's one of 
the biggest and best water conservation projects in years." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement signed Tuesday is between the water district -- which owns 2,400 
acres behind Prado Dam -- and the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the 
facility. Its purpose: to significantly boost the amount of water available to 
Orange County residents in exchange for a preserve that could help save the 
songbird. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is proof that man and wildlife can coexist," Rep. Ken Calvert 
(R-Riverside) told the dignitaries. "It shows that water management and 
environmental issues are not mutually exclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement marked the culmination of years of negotiations between the two 
government agencies. Built in 1941 primarily to control flooding, the dam has 
for many generations also caught enough rainwater to supply about 75% of the 
water consumed by residents of north and central Orange County. The rest of 
their water, district officials say, generally comes from either the Colorado 
River or Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, political and environmental concerns have put the future of 
such imported water in doubt. About six years ago, water district officials 
began negotiating with the corps for permission to increase the amount of water 
the county could store in the Prado Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1986 environmental impact statement indicated that use of the basin had 
seriously jeopardized the existence of the least Bell's vireo, a four-inch-high 
songbird that nests in the lower branches of the area's willow trees. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for its permission to increase the amount of stored water, the 
corps -- working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- asked the Orange 
County Water District to set aside acreage as a natural songbird habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the mid-1980s, the district has spent about $1.5 million to plant 
thousands of willow trees on 124 acres at the far end of the basin and to trap 
cowbirds, which prey on the vireo's young, said James A. Van Haun, executive 
assistant to the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he said, the number of known songbirds has increased from 19 
nesting pairs in 1986 to 123 last year. Eventually, Van Haun said, the district 
plans on setting aside 300 acres as vireo habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new agreement, the level of rainwater allowed to be stored in the 
basin from March 1 to Sept. 1 will increase to 498 feet above sea level -- 
enough extra water to meet the needs of about 120,000 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, Van Haun said, the Army corps did not allow the water to exceed 
494 feet above sea level, although that rule was waived on several occasions in 
recent years because of emergencies. Eventually, he said, the water district 
hopes to raise the maximum allowable level to 505 feet, an increase of about 
29,000 acre-feet, or enough to serve 150,000 people a year. One acre foot is 
326,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a lot of water," Van Haun said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Water is the lifeblood of California," Packard, one of the signers, said. 
"Without water we would live in a desert. This is a great water conservation 
project." Water for the Birds 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for more water storage behind Prado Dam, the Orange County Water 
District has paid the Army Corps of Engineers $1 million and set aside 124 
acres as habitat for the least Bell's vireo. A look at the endangered songbird 
that nests in willows in the flood plain behind the dam. 
</P>
<P>
 Least Bell's vireo: Vireo bellii pusillus . Status: State and federal 
endangered species. Habitat: Creeks and rivers, mainly found at Prado Dam and 
Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base. Diet: Mostly insects. Population: About 300 
pairs. Brood: Three to five eggs in nests usually suspended from branches. 
Dangers: Besides rapidly losing habitat, the elusive vireo is a victim of brood 
parasitism by cowbirds. Cowbirds lay their eggs in the vireo's nest, and 
cowbird chicks often displace the smaller vireos.

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / GLENN F. BUNTING: WHERE FAIR PLAY IS EARMARKED FOR 
FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 73-year-old, cigar-chomping Democratic congressman with three decades of 
House service would seem perfectly positioned to snatch all kinds of 
legislative goodies for his constituents back home. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Rep. George E. Brown Jr. seized the reins of the House Science, Space 
and Technology Committee in 1990, community leaders in his San 
Bernardino-Riverside district could be excused for counting on millions of 
dollars in federal high-tech facilities and thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown, a physicist by trade and a free spirit by nature, doesn't operate 
like a traditional pol. He firmly believes in -- get ready for this -- "playing 
by the rules," a motto Brown pursues with such vengeance that many colleagues 
have branded him a traitor and an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 "George is kind of an enigma in Washington," said Rep. Robert T. Matsui 
(D-Sacramento). "He is an old curmudgeon but at the same time he has a lot of 
conviction. He has never let politics or the fear of any member interfere with 
what he truly believes in. He is a unique guy in that respect around here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First elected to the House in 1962, Brown has been chastising colleagues for 
allocating federal funds to pet projects with little justification. This 
process, known as "earmarking," is usually initiated by high-priced lobbyists 
and arranged behind closed doors without the knowledge of most members of 
Congress or any built-in safeguards to ensure that the money is well spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Earmarks, Brown says, "are like mushrooms -- they grow best in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Brown watched in disgust as "a good friend," Rep. Jamie L. Whitten 
(D-Miss.), the former Appropriations Committee chairman, manipulated the House 
spending process to win federal grants for his constituents and his friends on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 When he took over as chairman of the Science Committee three years ago, Brown 
sought to halt awards of large science grants to the favorite college campuses 
of influential lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 He failed miserably. Academic earmarks more than doubled between 1990 and 
1992, from $248 million for 252 projects to $708 million for 499 projects, 
according to the Congressional Research Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of the 10 universities that received the most academic earmarks was 
remarkably similar from year to year, Brown found. While California's major 
research universities were shut out, the list included smaller campuses in the 
home state of influential Sen. Robert C. Byrd -- tiny Wheeling Jesuit College 
and the University of West Virginia received $40 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's fight against earmarks has the full support of California university 
officials. They argue that California campuses will garner more federal funding 
if allowed to compete fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was particularly infuriated by shenanigans he uncovered in the final 
months of the 1992 legislative session, when 10 members of a House-Senate 
conference committee inserted $95 million in an energy spending bill for 
projects in their own districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown led a successful fight on the House floor to let all universities and 
colleges compete for the $95 million. But his triumph was short-lived. Months 
later, during the last days of the legislative session, Brown discovered the 
same 10 projects buried in a 1,000-page defense spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
 An attempt to mount another challenge fell apart when the House leadership and 
rules committee sided against Brown. "It was all greased," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Brown mustered support to pass House rules changes that require 
disclosure of earmarks in advance. He also held oversight hearings that exposed 
egregious cases. 
</P>
<P>
 These measures helped produce a 1994 federal budget that cut in half the $750 
million in academic earmarks set aside the previous year, Brown said. At the 
same time, funding for authorized National Science Foundation programs jumped 
from $40 million to $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown paid a political price for his war on earmarks, aides say. After 
being warned by House appropriators that any requests for his district would 
face harsh scrutiny, Brown saw $10 million in previously approved funding for 
improvements to Ontario International Airport scrapped from this year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Such retaliation will not stop Brown from further embarrassing colleagues who 
engage in earmarking. "They have no support in principle for what they are 
doing, and they damn well know it," he said.

ARCHDIOCESE ASSAILS PRIEST'S CLAIM THAT PASTOR FRAMED HIM; TRIAL: ATTORNEY FOR 
FATHER DAVID PIROLI, WHO IS ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLING COLLECTIONS, SAYS FORMER HEAD 
OF CHURCH IN SIMI VALLEY STOLE MONEY AND PLANTED IT ON HIS CLIENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reacting angrily to a Simi Valley priest's allegation that he was framed for 
embezzlement by another priest, the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles 
attacked the claims Thursday as "a gross injustice" made without 
substantiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Father David Dean Piroli, 37, is on trial for charges that he embezzled 
$60,000 in donations from two Ventura County churches -- St. Peter Claver in 
Simi Valley and Sacred Heart in Saticoy.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, attorney Richard Beada said in court he will defend Piroli with a 
countercharge -- that Father James McKeon, former pastor at St. Peter Claver, 
was stealing the money and planted the cash in Piroli's car and rectory rooms 
because the younger priest was about to blow the whistle on him. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon had access to the same collection money and church bank accounts as 
Piroli, Beada argued, and was worried that Piroli was going to report to the 
diocese that he was skimming so much cash that "the church (was) on the verge 
of collapse."  
</P>
<P>
 Beada also told the court he would have witnesses testify that McKeon was seen 
at a West Hollywood gay bathhouse, and he gave the judge a videotape that he 
said proved that assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon apparently was stealing money from the church to support this activity, 
Beada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele said he would allow Beada 
to use the counterallegations to defend Piroli, but he refused to let jurors 
see or hear any evidence on allegations of homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon has declined to comment. But on Thursday, Father Gregory Coiro, 
spokesman for the archdiocese, issued this statement:  
</P>
<P>
 "As the victim of the crimes for which Father David Piroli is on trial, the 
archdiocese is reluctant to comment on the case, which is being competently 
prosecuted by the Ventura County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, considering allegations made by the defense attorney, Richard 
Beada," the statement said, "we must declare in no uncertain terms that we are 
just as appalled as Assistant Dist. Atty. Mary Peace, who called Mr. Beada's 
assertions 'outrageous and unsupported.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The statement concluded: "It is a gross injustice when an individual, who is 
not on trial, is victimized in open court by allegations that are 
unsubstantiated and which are so defamatory of one's good name." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection continued Thursday, and testimony is expected to begin next 
week. Piroli faces two felony counts of grand theft.

$5-MILLION ART COLLECTION OFFERED TO SMALL MUSEUM; PHILANTHROPY: BUT GIFT FROM 
SANTA BARBARA MAN WOULD REQUIRE AN EXPENSIVE MOVE BY CONEJO VALLEY FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Barbara art collector has promised to donate paintings, sculptures and 
carvings worth $5.5 million to the Conejo Valley Art Museum -- but only if the 
museum can move to a new location, which could cost millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Now located in a cramped storefront in the Janss Mall, the Conejo Valley Art 
Museum operates as a gallery, displaying new exhibits every few months. From 
delicate Ukrainian painted eggs to contemporary paintings of the Grand Canyon, 
the museum sponsors both foreign and local artists, but has no collection of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
 To help the museum establish permanent displays, donor Charles Craig has 
offered an eclectic assortment from his renowned personal collection. His gift 
would include contemporary abstract works -- huge painted canvases and glass 
sculptures -- as well as African carvings dating to 500 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection includes modern works by Stanley Boxer, an abstract artist who 
became known as a sculptor of paint; David Burliuk, founder of Russia's 
futurist art movement; Norman Bluhm, an abstract Expressionist; Suzanne 
Duchamp, another abstract artist; and Max Weber, a Cubist painter. Some of the 
canvases are just slightly bigger than a notebook, while others are 70 feet 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig's donation also includes ancient wooden, stone and clay sculptures from 
Asia, Africa, South America and the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 The collector's South American holdings came under scrutiny by the U.S. 
customs office a few years ago. Federal officials raided Craig's home in 1989 
and seized some Peruvian artifacts deemed to be Peruvian national treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 The customs officials also targeted six other Southern California dealers and 
collectors and sent 123 of the most valuable artifacts back to Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the museum board, Maria E. Dessornes, said she believes the 
artworks confiscated from Craig were later returned to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum displayed some of Craig's collection of drawings and watercolors in 
an exhibit last year, which received positive reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a well-known collection, with some very important pieces," said Paul 
Perrot, director of the Santa Barbara Art Museum, which has received several 
small donations from Craig in the past. Perrot could not speculate why Craig 
chose to offer so many works to a Thousand Oaks museum, saying only, "It's an 
exciting moment for them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Craig's pledge comes with significant strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Conejo Valley Art Museum can receive the donation, Dessornes and 
other board members must find a new facility big enough to house the 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimating the space requirements at 25,000 square feet, Dessornes has 
requested help from the Thousand Oaks City Council. Ideally, she said, a new 
Conejo Valley Art Museum could become a centerpiece of the Civic Arts Plaza, 
the $64-million performing arts and government center under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have the performing arts there, so to round it out, we need the 
visual arts," Dessornes said. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, city officials agree. They would love to see a museum at the Civic 
Arts Plaza site, particularly on the eight acres set aside for private 
development next to the massive public building under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in practice, they doubt they can help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't see where the finances might come from," Councilman Alex Fiore 
said. "My initial reaction is, they're really asking a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 With an annual budget of just $50,000 a year, the museum cannot afford to 
lease space in the new Civic Arts Plaza, Dessornes said. The museum's trustees 
would be prepared, however, to raise money for a new building, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But arts experts estimated that a 25,000-square-foot facility would cost close 
to $10 million to build.

 In a victory for a cancer victim suing the operators of the San Onofre nuclear 
power plant, a judge Thursday allowed an expert on the causes of cancer to 
testify that her cancer was caused by radiation leaks from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony of Dr. Harry B. Demopoulos on behalf of Rung C. Tang brought 
vigorous protests from attorneys for Southern California Edison Co., who 
derided his credentials, his experiments on rats and cats, and his relationship 
to celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing in the arena of rank speculation that we have been wallowing in 
from day one," Edison attorney Stephen G. Blitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge Rudi Brewster overruled Blitch's objections and 
allowed the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Demopoulos, a professor at New York University Medical School and author of 
the book "Cancer and the Environment," said that Rung contracted myelogeneous 
leukemia because of her work as a Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspector at 
San Onofre during 1985 and 1986. Rung is suing Edison for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Demopoulos spent several hours explaining the criteria used to determine 
cancer causation, including proximity to a known carcinogen, instances of the 
carcinogen in the workplace or environment, and the duration of those 
contamination episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Tang worked close to radiation, that the radiation got loose 
throughout the plant and that the contamination lasted for many months. He 
added that she had no history of cancer in her immediate family and no known 
exposure to significant amounts of radiation other than her work at San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
 As a hush fell over the jury, Demopoulos described the life of a cancer 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "They no longer consider themselves a human being," he said. "They consider 
themselves stamped with a label that is dehumanizing." 
</P>
<P>
 Radiation is the only known cause of myelogenous leukemia but cancer 
specialists say that there must be other causes because thousands of people 
with no known exposure to radiation get the disease. Blitch promised to call an 
expert who will testify that "99.9% of chronic myelogenous leukemia causes are 
unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 Blitch noted that Demopoulos is not an tumor or blood disease specialist, that 
his medical research has not involved radiation or nuclear safety and that he 
has treated only a handful of leukemia patients. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that although Demopoulos, a pathologist, maintains a clinical 
practice, he has found time to treat Clint Eastwood, Muhammad Ali and Sylvester 
Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
 Blitch argued that while Demopoulos' theories about the causes of cancer may 
be accurate in a general sense, they cannot be applied to a specific patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Tang's lawyer, Suzelle Smith, read from Demopoulos' resume, which includes 92 
articles in medical journals, training in radiation at the Armed Forces 
Institute of Pathology and training at the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Tang, 44, is recuperating from a bone marrow transplant and too weak to attend 
the trial. At the time Tang worked at San Onofre, the plant had continual 
problems with leaking fuel rods and microscopic particles called "fuel fleas" 
and was fined by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for radiation safety 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a maintenance worker received a dose of radiation 100 times larger 
than considered safe and later was found to have suffered chromosome damage, 
according to Nuclear Regulatory Commission reports read to the jury by 
Demopoulos. Tang worked in the same area as that worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorneys argue that Tang also was exposed to radiation and suffered 
chromosome damage that became cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 She was found to have leukemia in late 1992, six years after leaving San 
Onofre. Demopoulos testified that the latency period -- that is, the time 
between exposure and onset -- for radiation-caused leukemia is three to 10 
years.

MIDEAST; LIKUD FIGHTS PLO PACT WITH SCATTERSHOT 
</P>

<P>
 As the jet flew the 50 Israeli mayors, business leaders and professors east 
from Tel Aviv, the guide explained just how close the Israeli communities below 
would be to autonomous Palestine under the accord on self-government. He asked 
what this would mean for their security. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last house in Kfar Sava is just 200 meters from Qalqiliya," the narrator 
said, pointing out how the old "green line," the frontier between Israel and 
Jordan before the 1967 Middle East War, had faded away between Kfar Sava in 
Israel and Qalqiliya on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 At the microphone was Benjamin Netanyahu, chairman of Israel's opposition 
Likud Party. He was seeking allies among influential Israelis, mostly from 
outside his party, against the autonomy agreement with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government (of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin) is going to establish a 
Palestinian state here," Netanyahu warned, his voice deep, mellifluous and 
persuasive. "They don't admit it in public, but MKs (members of Knesset, the 
Israeli Parliament) are talking about it in the corridors." 
</P>
<P>
 Likud's mission now, Netanyahu said, explaining the party's plans for the 
weekly flights from Tel Aviv to Jericho and back, is "to expose what the 
government is trying to conceal from the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Netanyahu, regarded here as the "master of the sound bite" for his ability to 
articulate his views succinctly, appeared in good form on the inaugural flight 
and to have recovered from his own surprise at the agreement last August and 
from Likud's inability to block it in the Knesset. 
</P>
<P>
 But Likud remains a troubled, divided party under Netanyahu's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Although senior members of Rabin's Labor Party concede that opinion polls show 
that Likud would win an election now, political commentators and campaign 
consultants say they doubt Likud would actually be able to do so -- especially 
if Rabin called for an early vote after securing peace agreements with Syria 
and other neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its bitter opposition to the autonomy accord, Likud has had little 
success in putting forward an alternative.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Netanyahu, demonstrating Likud's uncertain approach, last week reversed his 
position on the accord with the PLO, telling Jewish settlers on the West Bank 
that a government he led would not be bound by it -- after insisting for four 
months that it would be a diplomatic and legal obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He moves, flustered, from opinion to opinion, from act to act, trying to seem 
at one and the same time like a smooth yuppie . . . an authoritative opposition 
leader . . . and an extremist," the respected liberal commentator Nahum Barnea 
wrote in Yediot Aharonot, Israel's most-read newspaper. "Every intelligent or 
bad idea that has come up in recent months in the right-wing parties has found 
itself immediately in Netanyahu's mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Likud's problems go beyond Netanyahu, although he won the chairmanship last 
spring as the leader most likely to take the party back to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Likud had hoped to become the rallying point for an alliance of forces opposed 
to the accord and, thus, benefit politically. But those forces have remained 
largely separate and divided -- the settlers movement on the West Bank and in 
the Gaza Strip, the ultra-religious and other political parties that are far to 
the right of Likud. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has dismayed Likud's supporters and potential allies the most has 
been renewed quarreling among party leaders, particularly between Netanyahu and 
his two principal rivals, former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and former 
Foreign Minister David Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon last week announced his intention to seek the premiership, within Likud 
or outside it, at the next election.  
</P>
<P>
 Netanyahu himself dismisses the in-fighting. "The constant fomenting of 
internal discord is something the Likud has suffered from for more than a 
decade," he said, recalling the intrigues against Menachem Begin, then Yitzhak 
Shamir. "Now it is apparently my turn." Israel's Scattered Opposition 
</P>
<P>
 After Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin stunned the world by reaching an 
accord with Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, analysts 
expected foes of the pact to galvanize around the opposition Likud Party and 
its leader, Bejamin Netanyahu. It hasn't quite worked that way. Now, many 
within his party are grumbling about his leadership. Who is Netanyahu and who 
are his challengers?

ITALY PREMIER QUITS, SIGNALING END OF ERA; GOVERNMENT: THE 73-YEAR-OLD FORMER 
CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR'S TECHNOCRAT REGIME HAD SEEN THE COUNTRY THROUGH A PERIOD 
OF CRITICAL CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi resigned Thursday, sounding the death 
knell for an old-pals political system that transported Italy from war-racked 
fascism to prosperous but corruption-scarred democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's 52nd postwar government passed quietly in a half-hour meeting on a 
springlike afternoon between Ciampi and his friend President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro at the Quirinale Palace overlooking the Eternal City. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was great ferment beneath the surface: With mainstay parties tarred 
by unprecedented scandal and the political center up for grabs, spring 
elections could bring left-wing parties to national power for the first time -- 
chief among them the former Italian Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalfaro received without public comment the resignation of the 73-year-old 
former central bank governor, whose eight-month technocrat government has 
weathered a period of critical change while enacting some remarkable reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian president meets leaders of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies 
today as a prelude to dissolving Parliament. Observers believe Scalfaro will 
ask Ciampi to remain at the head of a caretaker government until elections are 
held. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts expect Scalfaro to set the election for March 27 and to have 
completed the transition details by Sunday so that Italy starts the business 
week with a caretaker government in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The forcing of an early election underpinned an opposition no-confidence 
motion in Parliament, which Ciampi called "an invitation to resign." The motion 
was withdrawn Thursday after two days of debate, but by then Ciampi had decided 
to go even without it. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent, low-key banker who had never held political office or had any 
party affiliation has always portrayed himself as a transition figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalfaro named him as a compromise leader acceptable to all sides after a 
referendum last April pulled the rug from under center-right political parties 
that have ruled Italy without interruption since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The referendum demanded electoral reform to replace a proportional system that 
resulted in an unending procession of weak coalition governments. They in turn 
produced a system of party control that extended not only to Parliament but 
also to a national web of state-controlled enterprises from banks to television 
channels to huge industrial conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
 The system came to depend on a foundation of illegal patronage and kickbacks 
for government contracts. A two-year investigation of massive political bribery 
has uncovered billions of dollars in nationwide payoffs involving all major 
parties and many of Italy's largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 business people, politicians and bureaucrats are under 
investigation or in jail. More than 200 senators and deputies must face 
magistrates with hard questions to ask once their present parliamentary 
immunity expires. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Ciampi, a mulish Parliament whose majority parties have lost public 
confidence reluctantly approved a reform under which three-quarters of the 
seats in both the chamber and the senate will be filled by the candidate who 
wins the most votes in a given district. The change is intended to place more 
responsibility on individual politicians and loosen the vise-grip of party 
barons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The path is cleared," Ciampi told a year-end news conference, saying that he 
would leave office once the 1994 budget had been approved. Opposition forces 
joined with Ciampi supporters to pass it and new taxes aimed at reducing the 
largest state deficit and debt in the European Union (formerly the European 
Community). 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Ciampi's government also launched privatization of large 
government holdings, beginning with banks. It began reform of Italy's bloated 
and inept public administration and won agreement on labor costs that pleased 
entrepreneurs but alarmed unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation sank to around 4%, its lowest level in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Democrats, the largest party and the dominant partner in every 
postwar government, had hoped to delay elections until June to give themselves 
a chance to regroup from scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 But pressures for an early vote grew inevitable after municipal elections in 
December, in which candidates supported by the Democratic Party of the Left, 
the former Communists, swept major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Votes for candidates backed by Christian Democrats and their coalition allies 
shrank embarrassingly almost everywhere. An insurgent northern-based populist 
movement, the Northern League, and the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, 
profited from the protest vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that the former Communists, who now call themselves social 
democrats, are the likely victors of a spring election. In postwar decades, 
Italian Communists served as mayors of virtually every major Italian city, but 
while the party was Italy's second-largest, it was always a bridesmaid -- 
denied a share of national power in all 52 governments.

PARTICIPANTS IN '50S SCHOOL RADIATION TEST TELL OF FEARS; ETHICS: FORMER 
STUDENTS AT AN INSTITUTION FOR THE RETARDED TESTIFY ABOUT POSSIBLE LASTING 
EFFECTS FROM A FOOD EXPERIMENT. HEARINGS MAY BE STORMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two former students at a Massachusetts school for the mentally retarded told 
federal lawmakers Thursday that their excitement over taking part in a 1950s 
school Science Club had turned to fear since they learned that club members 
were fed cereal laced with radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony of two subjects of radiation experiments marked a dramatic 
opening to what is expected to be a season of stormy congressional hearings on 
some three decades of human experimentation involving radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 His voice cracking, Austin LaRocque, a 47-year-old building superintendent who 
participated in a four-year series of experiments, told lawmakers that he 
feared the experiments could have lasting effects on him and on his three 
healthy children. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was your son, would you have accepted it?" LaRocque, who is mildly 
retarded, demanded of Dr. A. Bertran Brill, director of nuclear medicine 
research at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing what I know now, I would honestly say yes," Brill told LaRocque. But 
"at that time, I don't know," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Brill told the Senate hearing chaired by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that 
the 1951-54 experiments at the Fernald State School for the mentally retarded 
here exposed subjects to extremely low doses of radiation. He defended the 
experiments as motivated by a desire to find out about childrens' nutritional 
needs rather than to serve Cold War military goals. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than four decades of secrecy, the government's use of human guinea 
pigs in radiation experiments after World War II has been revealed by Energy 
Secretary Hazel O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration witnesses at Thursday's hearing told lawmakers that 
they would turn over federal records of the experiments, but they cautioned 
that it probably would be time consuming to collect the records and that the 
information provided probably would be spotty. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Marty Albert, director of medical research services for the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, told lawmakers that "there's a good chance a lot of those 
records are just plain lost." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very aware of the enormity of the task we confront," added Dr. Tara 
O'Toole, the assistant energy secretary who is overseeing the gathering of 
documents. "This is going to be painful," she said, but necessary to "do right" 
by the many subjects who were uninformed and sometimes misled by scientists 
whose studies were underwritten by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to parents or guardians of experiment subjects, for instance, 
Fernald administrators said that the proposed study "will cause no discomfort 
or change in their physical condition, other than possible improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 LaRocque and a fellow Fernald student, 49-year-old Charles Dyer, said that 
members of the Science Club were eager to participate because they were fed 
special food and taken on trips off the school's campus. Dyer recalled that he 
was given a Mickey Mouse watch by researchers and invited to a party at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which conducted the experiments under 
federal sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They said it would benefit us by taking our vitamins and stuff. And I said, 
'Su" said Dyer, now a truck driver with two children. "They took advantage of 
us because we were young." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who attended the hearing, said that Dyer and 
LaRocque had been "unwittingly drafted as foot soldiers in the Cold War." 
Markey and Kennedy proposed legislation that would strengthen protection for 
human subjects in medical experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. J. David Litster, a physicist who is conducting a technical review of 
experiments by MIT researchers, said that the dose of radioactive iron 
administered at Fernald statistically would result in one additional cancer 
death in a population of 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But medical ethicists deplored the absence of the subjects' informed consent 
and the choice of an institutionalized population of children for the 
experiments.

MEDICAL COSTS ROSE 5.4% IN 1993, SLOWEST GROWTH RATE IN 20 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The steady increase in medical prices, a primary force fueling the health care 
reform debate, tapered off markedly last year, the Labor Department reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Its latest consumer price index found that medical costs rose by 5.4% in 1993 
-- the slowest growth rate in 20 years. But that still was twice the rate of 
the overall increase in consumer prices for last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department report heightened concerns among health care reform 
advocates that the trend threatens to take the steam out of the movement. But 
the news cheered many in the health care industry, who cited the data as proof 
that there is no need for the sweeping reforms sought by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real question is, what caused this (slowdown) and whether this will be 
sustained," said Dr. Edith Rasell, a physician and health economist at the 
Economic Policy Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Some health economists have speculated that the slowdown is artificial -- that 
is, doctors, drug firms and other medical providers have deliberately 
restrained price increases as a way to stave off comprehensive health care 
reform. Princeton economist Uwe Reinhardt has called the phenomenon "the 
Hillary factor," a reference to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who led 
development of the Administration proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another theory," said Rasell, "is that there is now more competition and that 
it is finally working and prices are under control." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause, however, Rasell said that medical inflation at twice the 
rate of the rest of the economy is still too high. 
</P>
<P>
 The CPI also showed that pharmaceutical prices rose by 3.1% -- a drop of more 
than half from the 6.4% growth rate in 1992 and the lowest increase in nearly 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cost control is happening even before any enactment of health care reform," 
said Gerald J. Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over controlling health care costs also surfaced Thursday as 
more than 550 economists urged Clinton to abandon his plan to limit the rate of 
growth of insurance premiums. They warned that any attempt to impose stringent 
controls on health spending may result in long waits for services and a 
deterioration in care. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton Administration quickly disputed the economists, who released a 
letter that they have sent to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the signers were many conservative thinkers associated with the Ronald 
Reagan and George Bush administrations, including Michael J. Boskin, chairman 
of the Council of Economic Advisers under Bush; William A. Niskanen, a council 
member under Reagan; and two other Reagan economic officials: Martin Anderson 
and Steve Hanke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Price controls produce shortages, black markets and reduced quality," their 
letter stated. "You insist that your health care plan avoids price controls. We 
respectfully disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of Administration officials rebutted the economists, arguing that a 
cap on insurance premiums is intended only as a backup mechanism in the event 
that market incentives and competition fail to work.

4 BLACK FAMILIES ARE MOVED INTO ALL-WHITE HOUSING PROJECT IN TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIANNE HART and RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal officials Thursday moved four black families into an all-white public 
housing complex in Vidor, Tex., that had been seized by the government when an 
earlier integration attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Police stood guard as three moving vans and at least three carloads of black 
motorists drove up to the 74-unit complex. Housing and Urban Development 
officials said four families -- two single women with children, one single 
woman and one single man -- moved into the complex before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The action fulfills a promise by HUD Secretary Henry G. Cisneros last fall to 
compel integration at the project about 80 miles east of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Vidor is the most visible of dozens of East Texas housing projects ordered 
integrated by federal District Judge William Wayne Justice nearly a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said Vidor represents broader HUD plans to comply with the court 
order in coming months. "The four families who moved into the Vidor site today 
will be followed by other minority families in Vidor and in 69 other public 
housing projects in 36 counties across East Texas," he said at a Washington 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous attempt to integrate the Vidor complex failed in September when the 
last of its black residents, 37-year-old Bill Simpson, left after complaining 
of a hostile atmosphere. Less than 24 hours later, Simpson was shot to death in 
nearby Beaumont, Tex., in an incident police said was unrelated to the Vidor 
integration effort. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD took control of the complex in October, citing the failure of the local 
housing authority to desegregate the complex during its 36-year tenure. If 
Simpson had "not been intimidated out of his housing unit, he'd probably still 
be alive today," Cisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vidor, population 11,000, is a particular flash point because of the 
longstanding presence of the Ku Klux Klan, which has insisted that the 
community does not need or want integrated public housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vidor Mayor Ruth Woods has protested that the town is unfairly portrayed 
as a bastion of racism and that most residents are ready for the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just anxious to get this (integration) done and over with," Woods has 
said. "Nobody wants this to work more than I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lowe, the grand dragon of the Texas Ku Klux Klan, said he is planning 
rallies in coming months to protest federal integration of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 A security system will limit access mainly to residents and their guests. One 
resident told reporters that the new families were welcomed by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart reported from Houston and Delgado from Washington.

WITH CHIAPAS CEASE-FIRE, POLITICAL FALLOUT BEGINS; MEXICO: THE SAME SEMI-FEUDAL 
POWER STRUCTURE THAT SHUT OUT REBELLIOUS INDIANS HAS LONG DELIVERED THE VOTE 
FOR PRI.

 The fighting appeared to have halted in southern Mexico on Thursday, but the 
political fallout from 12 days of guerrilla warfare has barely begun. 
</P>
<P>
 The uprising that cost more than 100 lives, observers say, is an indictment of 
a semi-feudal system that has left many Indians feeling powerless, with no way 
to resolve their problems by peaceful means. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that same system is what guarantees that Chiapas, the state bordering 
Guatemala, turns out a solid majority for the ruling party election after 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 With a presidential vote upcoming in August, analysts said, politicians may be 
reluctant to dismantle the power structure in a state that has become known as 
a strategic reserve of votes for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 But they seemingly have little choice. "Chiapas may be a mother lode of votes 
for the PRI, but it could also be its tomb," warned Cecilia Romero, assistant 
secretary general of the National Action Party, the major right-wing opposition 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the government appeared to be moving toward peace with the rebels by 
meeting two of their demands for negotiations -- calling a unilateral 
cease-fire Wednesday and recognizing them Thursday as a "political and military 
force" -- the consequences of the uprising were becoming more clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides crowding the presidential campaign off the front page, the rebels have 
changed the focus of the debate, pushing issues of poverty and unequal 
distribution of wealth into the foreground. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the violence in Chiapas has pointed out the pitfalls of what critics 
of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari call Salinas - troika: perestroika 
(restructuring) without glasnost (political openness or reform) .  
</P>
<P>
 Salinas' fast-track, free-market economic reforms contrast sharply with the 
lack of change in a political patronage system that has kept his party in power 
for six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas supporters have argued that economic change had to precede political 
shifts to avoid the risk of social upheaval. The appearance of the Zapatista 
National Liberation Army in Chiapas, combined with the immediate support the 
group received from urban guerrillas setting off bombs in the capital and other 
cities, makes that reasoning seem dubious now, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom and democracy lead the list of the rebels' demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiapas' Indians are governed by traditional leaders -- caciques (political 
bosses) who are closely tied to the PRI. Those who live outside their ancestral 
villages generally work for large cattle ranches whose owners also have close 
PRI alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1991 midterm congressional elections, more than three-fourths of 
Chiapas voters cast ballots for the ruling party, according to the Federal 
Electoral Institute. That compares with 60% nationwide. In four remote 
communities, the PRI won 100% of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those high percentages raise suspicions of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Dabrowski -- of the campaign of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, an opposition 
party presidential candidate -- observed that, "Almost everyone has pointed to 
the political closure, not allowing a legal means of expression, as being at 
the root of the violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Those lessons have resulted in a major victory for the progressive wing of the 
PRI, evident in the appointment of human rights advocate Jorge Carpizo 
MacGregor as Mexican interior minister, said Roderic Camp, a political 
scientist at Tulane University. Carpizo, who replaces an old-style PRI 
politician, will be responsible not only for domestic policy in the current 
crisis but also for organizing and certifying the legitimacy of the August 
presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "His personal integrity is such that he would not be willing to certify an 
election that was broadly fraudulent," said Camp.  
</P>
<P>
 That increases the pressure on PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio 
to win cleanly at the same time the focus of the campaign is shifting to 
issues, such as social concerns, that may not favor his party or him 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
 As social development minister, Colosio was in charge of the Solidarity 
anti-poverty program, which was supposed to solve the desperate problems of 
starvation and illness that the Zapatistas say are at the heart of their 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the embarrassment, Salinas has called on skilled negotiator Manuel 
Camacho Solis to reach an agreement with the rebels. Many Mexicans felt that 
the popular former Mexico City mayor should have been his party's presidential 
pick. "Colosio looks less and less like a good candidate," said Castaneda. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the violence has made left-leaning Cardenas look less 
radical. "People are starting to ask, what's worse," said Castaneda, "Cardenas 
or the guerrillas blowing up the whole place?"

YELTSIN ALLY IS ELECTED SPEAKER OF UPPER HOUSE; RUSSIA: SHUMEIKO'S VICTORY 
INDICATES THAT THE NEW PARLIAMENT WILL BE MORE CONCILIATORY THAN THE ONE THE 
PRESIDENT DISSOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Lawmakers elected a close ally of President Boris N. Yeltsin as Speaker of 
Russia's equivalent of the U.S. Senate on Thursday in a sign that the 
legislative body will be more conciliatory than the old Parliament, which 
Yeltsin dissolved in September. 
</P>
<P>
 First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir F. Shumeiko, a former factory director 
whom Yeltsin has called on for such dirty tasks as closing down newspapers and 
seeking to ban opposition parties, won the Speaker's post with 98 votes in the 
178-seat Federation Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumeiko did not hide that he is the Russian president's man, commenting, "It 
is unlikely that our relations will be complex -- Boris Yeltsin and I share the 
same point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Duma, the lower chamber of Russia's new Parliament, it was a 
different story, with ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky turning the 
Speaker's race there into a parliamentary circus. At one point, when 
Zhirinovsky was speaking and he was interrupted by noise from the hall, he 
exploded, "Shut up!" 
</P>
<P>
 When Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais pointed at his watch, indicating 
that time was up, Zhirinovsky shouted, "You'll be showing your watch in your 
cell in Lefortovo (prison), Mr. Chubais!" 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky withdrew his candidacy for Speaker, although he had argued that 
because his party had won more votes than any other in Dec. 12 elections, the 
post should automatically be his. Instead, he said menacingly, he would wait 
for the 1996 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, neither of the candidates left in the race -- which continues 
today -- was likely to please Yeltsin: One had led the Communist faction in the 
old Soviet legislature, the other was a champion weightlifter and writer who 
has undergone a vivid transformation from liberal to hard-line patriot. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was good news for the Russian president. In the official count of 
each faction's membership, the pro-reform Russia's Choice came out first with 
76 deputies, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. The combined opposition of 
Communists and Zhirinovsky's nationalists totaled only 163 seats, far from a 
majority in the 444-member body. 
</P>
<P>
 In the more decorous Federation Council, the battle over Shumeiko's election 
laid bare the chamber's main division: One camp tends toward supporting Moscow 
and the central government, while the other leans toward regional interests. 
Shumeiko's rival, a factory chief from the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, 
trailed by only two votes in an earlier round of voting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shumeiko observed: "We shall try not to let the elections result in a 
split of the chamber." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin accused the last Parliament of constantly acting to block his attempts 
at reforms and dissolved it on Sept. 21. When lawmakers armed themselves and 
opposed him, he brought in tanks and troops to clear their headquarters, the 
White House, in fighting that killed scores of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide balloting on Dec. 12 produced a new Russian constitution that gave 
the president more power and Parliament less. It also provided for a new 
Parliament, known as the Federal Assembly, with the Federation Council as its 
upper chamber and the Duma as the lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumeiko served as deputy Speaker in the old Parliament and was known as a 
relative moderate. After shifting from Parliament to the government, he was 
accused of corruption and suspended during an investigation, but beat back the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The parliamentary races came amid jostling for government posts that, although 
going on behind the scenes, appeared at least as critical for Russia's 
political future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin issued a decree on slashing the government Monday; since then, the 
fate of virtually all Russian ministers has been up in the air. Even economic 
mastermind Yegor T. Gaidar, who has plotted the course of Russia's reforms, had 
no guarantee that he would remain a deputy prime minister, although Yeltsin has 
pledged that Gaidar would remain in the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Singled out by Russian media for probable axing was Finance Minister Boris G. 
Fyodorov, an adherent of Gaidar's school of tight monetary policy. Although 
Yeltsin has vowed that reforms will continue, he has also indicated that the 
December election results convinced him that social spending must be increased, 
even if that means an increase in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 From a group dominated by Gaidar's team of young reformers, the Russian 
Cabinet appears likely to turn into more of a coalition government. Despite 
complaints from reformers, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin has said that 
he plans to retain Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zaveryukha, who is aligned 
with the pro-Communist Agrarian Party and opposes Yeltsin's land reform, in his 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernomyrdin said that he would announce the members of the new Cabinet on 
Monday.

CLINTON COUNCIL TARGETS ENVIRONMENT, ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Depending on one's point of view, President Clinton's new Council on 
Sustainable Development convened in Seattle on Thursday either to lead America 
toward a future in which jobs and nature both flourish, or to indulge in a 
political fairy tale and distract the nation from its implacable economic and 
environmental demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Composed of five members of Clinton's Cabinet and leading industrial and 
environmentalist figures, the council will seek practical ways to shape America 
in Clinton's vision -- satisfying the needs of today's generation without 
sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday the council may recommend sweeping legislation and regulatory reform. 
On Thursday, it took a first step, unveiling a set of nine principles to guide 
its work. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft statement, written by a task force of some of the more 
environmental-minded of the council's 27 members, struck a tone that is sure to 
generate debate, if not results. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps its boldest call was seeking an end to poverty as an essential 
component to economic and environmental well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 But others were just as far-reaching: redesigning the free-market system to 
factor into goods the environmental costs of their production. And altering the 
burden of proof in economic decision-making so that potential environmental 
dangers are given weight "even in the face of scientific uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
 The council draft also proposed adding environmental quality as an essential 
component to national security, along with military defense and economic 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore urged the council via satellite hookup to "be bold . . 
. be practical" in trying to formulate policies that are cleaner for the 
environment and cheaper for industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimists might be pleased to hear Nature Conservancy President John Sawhill 
speaking about environmentally friendly "development" or Dow Vice President 
David T. Buzzelli adding up the favorable investment returns for eliminating 
pollution rather than just trying to control it. 
</P>
<P>
 But pessimists, including some council members, worried that even a bold start 
by the council fell far short of the challenge facing America and the world. 
National Wildlife Federation President Jay D. Hair noted that the council had 
not yet shown any willingness to tackle energy conservation policy or global 
population stabilization "without which we have nothing."

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; CLINTON A GLASS ACT AS VODKA FLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A leader needs intestinal fortitude for the hard work of summits, and perhaps 
fortitude of the liver as well. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has the endurance of a draft animal when it comes to doing 
without sleep, but this jaunt to Eastern Europe is also testing his ability to 
absorb vodka in a region where real men are expected to down it by the glass. 
</P>
<P>
 In the diplomatic equivalent of a drop-by in Kiev on Wednesday night, Clinton 
politely matched Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk belt-for-several-belts. On 
Thursday night, he moved on to Moscow, where the schedule called for a "working 
dinner" with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin that threatened to turn into a 
"drinking dinner," one aide joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides insisted Clinton could take it, but when he arrived in Moscow in the wee 
hours of Thursday after his session with Kravchuk, the President headed for a 
restorative session in the sauna. Hours later, in his first encounter with 
Yeltsin at the Kremlin, Clinton -- who had only about three hours' sleep -- was 
"a little bleary," the official conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In their first day in Moscow, the Americans traveling with Clinton witnessed a 
bit of the casual attitude toward work that challenges Russian efforts to 
develop a free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 A shuttle bus had been set up to relay White House staff and press between the 
two hotels where they are quartered, but it was largely put out of action by 
drivers whose labors seemed to be guided more by their whims than their 
instructions. Coffee and lunch breaks, not to mention the disco music playing 
in one hotel, seemed to consume most of their time. 
</P>
<P>
 One driver had installed a portable television set beside the steering wheel 
and couldn't seem to tear his eyes from a soap opera as he piloted his 
lumbering vehicle across the traffic-choked and ice-slick boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there were also signs of stirring capitalist initiative. Moscow's IPCC-M 
Bar and Grill joined a number of taverns in the formerly Communist and free 
worlds that have tried the marketing gimmick of inviting Clinton to play his 
saxophone on their premises. It doesn't always work, of course, but it can be 
counted on to generate attention. "Isn't it time you blew off a little steam?" 
the cafe asked Clinton, and music lovers, in a flyer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They have lost their savings, their incomes and some even their homes. But in 
this winter of hardship, Russians will have bananas. Or at least pieces of 
bananas. Chiquita Brands International Inc. is handing out 10 million of its 
bananas in this depressed nation. That's only one for every 17 Russians, but 
the company plans to concentrate its effort by giving them to Muscovite 
children, hospital patients and the poor. At a promotional cocktail party, 
State Department officials and press ate bananas and mingled with young Russian 
women wearing Carmen Miranda-style, plastic-fruit headgear. 
</P>
<P>
 The project taught the company a lesson about Russian power structure that 
might be useful to Clinton as he tries to cultivate Yeltsin. Chiquita first 
approached officials of the national government to arrange the gift, but then 
switched the effort when city officials told them there was no point. "Why mess 
with them?" a city official asked. "They have no money, no power." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Moscow supper club owned by a New Yorker ran an ad in the English-language 
Moscow Times on the eve of Clinton's arrival listing the "Top 10 Reasons Bill 
Clinton Should Eat at Manhattan Express." Aside from reason No. 9 ("Neil Bush 
was here so we need a bigger Democrat to tip the scales the right way"), there 
were many references to the President's second priority on his Moscow trip: 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 "10. We are closer to the Kremlin than McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 "8. Pizza Hut only allows one trip to the salad bar." 
</P>
<P>
 "5. We'll send out for jelly doughnuts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was also a lot of talk in the Russian papers about where Clinton would 
sleep and change clothes during his three nights in the Russian capital. His 
decision to spend the first two nights in the American-run Radisson 
Slavjanskaya Hotel instead of at Spaso House prompted the Itar-Tass headline: 
"Clinton Prefers Flashy Hotel to Ambassador's Residence." The Itar-Tass 
reporter was miffed when hotel authorities would not tell him what floor 
Clinton's $800-a-night suite was on. 
</P>

AT YELTSIN DACHA , DINNER GUESTS PUCKER UP FOR . . . MOOSE LIPS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Macbeth's witches had their eye of newt and toe of frog. But moose lips? 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin had President Clinton and aides out to his 
country dacha southeast of Moscow for a three-hour summit feast Thursday night, 
and if some elements of the evening were familiar, others were like nothing the 
man from Hope, Ark., had ever seen before. But then neither had the most 
cosmopolitan of his aides. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening started with some sober talk of Russian politics and East-West 
issues, but when it came time for dinner, the menu featured a traditional 
Russian delicacy: moose lips. "And I don't mean a chocolate dessert," a senior 
presidential adviser said later in a briefing for reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, how were they? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was . . . it was good," the aide replied, and after just the slightest 
pause for the diplomatically correct word, he added, "It was unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 Other elements of the menu were more conventional. Roast suckling pig (two of 
them). Duck in red wine. Caviar. Vodka, wine and lots of mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
 The dacha , named Novoye Ogaryevo and built just before the turn of the 
century for an uncle of the last czar, is an elegant, three-story, yellow brick 
and stone affair nestled in the woods on an expansive estate and surrounded by 
a tall wall and iron fence. "Nice little digs you have," Clinton remarked as he 
met Yeltsin at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lighted Christmas trees could be seen here and there on the snow-covered 
grounds and in one of the drawing rooms inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Before dinner, a string quartet serenaded the distinguished company. After the 
feast, there was the now-ritualistic surprise: Of all things, the dacha turned 
out to have a saxophone. And soon the President was warming up. 
</P>
<P>
 Unexpectedly, the pianist from the string quartet in the adjoining room began 
to chime in, picking up on the notes and musical phrases the President was 
playing before he launched into his recital. Clinton responded, and soon an 
impromptu jam session was under way, though the two musicians were in different 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Clinton stopped and suggested the entire company move into the room 
with the piano. Out trooped the dignitaries, and the performance resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's finale was his signature renditions of "Summertime" and "My Funny 
Valentine," in C minor.

NEW VISION FOR THE OLD WORLD; U.S. FOCUS SHOWS SUBTLE SHIFT TO NEXT GENERATION; 
POLITICS: WHILE CLINTON IS CLEARLY BACKING YELTSIN, THE AMERICAN IS HEDGING HIS 
BETS BY RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH UP-AND-COMING LEADERS.

<P>
 President Clinton's first summit visit to Russia on Thursday reflected two 
concerns that have come to dominate U.S. policy toward its troubled former 
adversary: keeping up the pace of economic reforms to erase the legacy of 
communism at any cost, and quietly preparing for the day when President Boris 
N. Yeltsin is no longer in power. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, Clinton's hopes for Russia remain solidly with Yeltsin, and 
the President spent almost eight hours extolling his leadership and bonding 
with the Russian leader, including a brisk 20-minute walk through snowy Kremlin 
courtyards and a three-hour-long banquet that boasted caviar and braised moose 
lips. 
</P>
<P>
 But in more subtle ways, Clinton and his aides are beginning to focus as well 
on the next generation of Russia's leaders -- from Yeltsin's own lieutenants to 
the rising stars of the newly elected Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theme of this summit is: Beyond Yeltsin," said Andrei Kortunov, a leading 
Russian expert on East-West relations. "It isn't explicit. But if you look at 
Clinton's agenda, the people he is meeting and the things he is saying, it 
shows that the Americans are moving away from their dependence on one man and 
preparing for what comes later." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official agreed. "Yeltsin won't be around forever," he said. "We 
want to do what we can to support all the forces of reform, so that after 
Yeltsin is gone the process will continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is not abandoning Yeltsin; far from it. Indeed, critics in both Moscow 
and Washington complain that the Administration still relies too much on the 
Russian leader. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yeltsin's health has been notoriously uneven. Some U.S. officials doubt 
that he will run again after his term ends in June, 1996; some Russians wonder 
whether he will survive until then. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, officials noted, one of Clinton's most important events on Thursday was 
a reception at Spaso House, the residence of the American ambassador here, 
where the President met dozens of members of the new Russian Parliament -- 
including, along with reformers, one unreconstructed Communist and a polite 
young associate of fiery ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, whose party 
shocked many with its strength in December's parliamentary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky, who has proposed reconquering all the lands of the old Russian 
Empire including Alaska, was pointedly not invited. But by welcoming one of his 
followers, Clinton sent a signal that the United States is willing to work with 
Russian nationalists if they moderate their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton and his aides have been carefully cultivating the 
next generation of leaders in Yeltsin's camp -- while trying not to play 
favorites. At a briefing for reporters Thursday, one senior Administration 
official lavished praise on Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, a leading 
voice for economic reform -- and then added guiltily: "I meant to say some nice 
things about (Prime Minister Viktor S.) Chernomyrdin," Gaidar's main rival in 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
 To many Russians, the main message of Clinton's visit is still an endorsement 
of Yeltsin that U.S. officials hope will bolster his standing against 
Zhirinovsky, the resurgent Communists and other extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The visit means that the West's confidence in Yeltsin remains valid after the 
(parliamentary) election," said Mikhail Berger, an editor of the leading 
newspaper Izvestia. "This is very important for Yeltsin's team. It suggests to 
Russians that nothing terrible has happened, everything is going its due 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Berger said, Clinton appears to be "boosting Chernomyrdin as 
the most likely successor" to Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel G. Bunich, a leading reform economist who is critical of Yeltsin, said 
Clinton has done a good job of widening his contacts within the government but 
has not reached out enough to the opposition. "He's still betting all his money 
on one horse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a larger sense, the proliferation of American contacts with Moscow's 
politicians reflects the gradual normalization of U.S.-Russian relations -- 
from the Cold War, when a cordial handshake between a President and a Soviet 
leader seemed to spell the difference between peace and war, to the kind of 
routine relationships the United States carries on with most countries in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 That change was reflected as well in Clinton's agenda for this meeting. The 
U.S.-Soviet summits of the Cold War focused on avoiding confrontation and 
averting the danger of nuclear war; the U.S.-Russian summits following the 
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 centered on launching economic aid 
programs to move the former Communist states toward Western-style capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the focus has moved once again -- to making existing Western aid programs 
work, especially in easing the privation suffered by ordinary Russians as old 
economic structures die. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russian-American relations have passed the period when their relations 
focused on humanitarian and other assistance to Russia at the initial stage of 
reform," said Georgy Mamedov, deputy foreign minister. "Now they have moved on 
to macroeconomic partnership, support for structural reform in Russia, 
transformation of relations between Russia, its neighbors and large countries 
of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The tone of the meetings has changed as well, U.S. and Russian officials said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "What was different about today's meeting? There were no cold faces and frozen 
formal phrases that were so typical of summits past," said Dmitry V. 
Ardamatsky, a presidential spokesman.

NEW VISION FOR THE OLD WORLD; ODD MIX OF OLD AND NEW MINGLE AT EMBASSY FETE; 
RUSSIA: THE CROWD AT THE EVENING RECEPTION IS SO DIVERSE THAT CLINTON 
CONGRATULATES THE GUESTS FOR TOLERATING EACH OTHER.

 You would never expect to see them in the same room: a black-clad poet of the 
1960s and a ruddy neo-Communist of the 1990s, a 25-year-old banker standing in 
for jingoist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and the sage old architect of perestroika 
. 
</P>
<P>
 But President Clinton had wanted to meet with the New Russia at the Thursday 
evening reception held amid the pillared glories of Spaso House, the 
mansion-residence of the U.S. ambassador in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was just what he got: a group so varied and, in many cases, 
politically opposed that he actually congratulated them in a brief address for 
tolerating each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the reception "an extraordinary and unprecedented gathering," Clinton 
told about 200 guests he was "glad to see you all getting along so well." 
</P>
<P>
 For Clinton, the diversity of his guests was a positive sign that his 
Administration is trying to avoid past mistakes -- such as the U.S. Embassy's 
habit of concentrating all its efforts on cultivating one group of politicians 
when another was clearly on its way up. 
</P>
<P>
 In America's democratic system, for political foes to socialize together is 
routine. Indeed, the ability of political leaders to fight the bitterest of 
policy battles while remaining united in their commitment to society's 
underlying values is the essence of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a measure of how far Russia's leaders have to go in understanding 
the nature of the democratic system they are committed to adopting that the 
scene at Spaso House was anything but routine. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country where political enemies from earliest times until the recent past 
imprisoned, tortured and killed their opponents, it seemed bizarre to many of 
those at Spaso House to see sworn enemies of the past mingling and sampling 
crustless caviar rounds together. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have the sheep and the wolf in the same cage," talent agent Victoria 
Pavlova said. She singled out Bella Akhmadulina, a beloved dissident poet who 
became famous during the cultural thaw of the 1960s, and Gennady A. Zyuganov, 
leader of the revamped Communist Party of Russia and its healthy faction in the 
new Russian Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pluralism," Pavlova's husband, Vitaly, told her. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Embassy's pluralism went only so far. It invited leaders of all 
Russia's prominent new parties except for Zhirinovsky, who was being 
determinedly snubbed even though his misleadingly named Liberal Democratic 
Party made a strong showing -- second only to that of the pro-Yeltsin Russia's 
Choice -- in last month's election for parliamentary seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials even worried aloud that Zhirinovsky, in his 
aggressive manner, might try to crash the party. They were prepared; at least 
eight guards in dark suits manned the metal detector at the entry to Spaso 
House.  
</P>
<P>
 There was no way Zhirinovsky could be invited; Vice President Al Gore has 
denounced him as "reprehensible" for his racist remarks and his position that 
Russia should expand into the Baltics and toward the Indian Ocean. He has also 
advocated bombing Germany and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the election results showed that his ever-scowling 
countenance must be considered, sadly enough, the face of the New Russia, at 
least in part. 
</P>
<P>
 So protocol whizzes compromised and invited one of Zhirinovsky's lieutenants, 
Alexei Mitrofanov. But instead of Mitrofanov, Zhirinovsky was represented by 
Maxim Travkin, a 25-year-old banker. 
</P>
<P>
 Travkin explained that he was not an official member of Zhirinovsky's party 
but just a friend, and he had come mainly to report back on what occurred. 
Zhirinovsky would not have come where he was not invited, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky, meanwhile, vented his spleen at another venue, the Duma, or lower 
house of the new Russian Parliament, where he is already making his mark as one 
of the most vocal of members. 
</P>
<P>
 He repeated earlier remarks that Clinton was giving him "a big gift" by 
snubbing him, because being rejected by American leaders would make him more 
popular among Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Communist Party is also not particularly welcoming of Western aid and 
influence. But that did not keep party leader Zyuganov or prominent opposition 
deputy Sergei N. Baburin from being invited to the embassy reception. Nor did 
past anti-American statements keep away Alexander Yakovlev, the venerable 
former Communist Party ideologist who helped conceptualize perestroika , the 
reforms beginning in the mid-1980s that broke down Soviet Communist rule.

BUSH ARRIVES IN CHINA ON GOODWILL VISIT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President George Bush began a private goodwill visit to China on 
Thursday as the Clinton Administration and Beijing continued to trade sharp 
words over human rights and trade privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 China's official New China News Agency said Bush arrived with an entourage 
including former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, and was greeted at 
the airport by Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese officials said Bush had requested that his six-day visit be kept 
low-key, and there were no preparations for media access to the former American 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, widely regarded here as a "friend of China," is expected to meet Chinese 
leaders such as President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng during his trip.

THAILAND AND CAMBODIA SIGN TREATY OF COOPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thailand and Cambodia signed a treaty Thursday aimed at ushering in a new era 
of mutual trust and cooperation after months of strained relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Cambodia's two prime ministers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, and 
visiting Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai signed the document, which covers 
border security, business agreements and bilateral aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuan's visit is the first by a Thai prime minister since Cambodia gained 
independence from France in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty calls for future disputes over border security to be handled by a 
Joint Commission for Bilateral Cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The criminal and illegal activities by armed individuals and groups on and 
along the Thai-Cambodian border, affecting the security of both countries, 
should be looked at seriously," the treaty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuan had earlier assured his Cambodian hosts that his country was not 
supporting the Khmer Rouge guerrillas, the last group resisting a U.N.-brokered 
pact to put an end to 13 years of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Cambodian army commanders and U.N. officials have accused the Thai army of 
supporting recent attacks by the rebels in northwest Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the treaty, Thailand promised $1.2 million in aid to help Cambodia 
improve public health, education, agriculture, banking, civil aviation, science 
and technology.

 The NAACP and others are planning to counter the Ku Klux Klan's protests this 
weekend against the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday, including 
demonstrations in some klan leaders' neighborhoods. Rallies at state capitols 
in Ohio, Colorado, Arkansas, Kansas, Alabama, Florida, Texas and Illinois are 
being organized by the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan's national office in 
Harrison, Ark. However, some NAACP chapter presidents said 
counterdemonstrations would only give the klan more attention because of 
increased media coverage.

WOMEN WILL GET LIMITED COMBAT ROLES; MILITARY: NEW PENTAGON POLICY WOULD ENABLE 
THEM TO SERVE IN SUPPORT JOBS. HOW FULLY ARMY, MARINE CORPS WOULD CARRY OUT THE 
PLAN IS KEY ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon announced a new policy Thursday that would allow women to serve 
in some combat support jobs but skeptics immediately questioned how fully the 
Army and Marine Corps -- both of which are reluctant to make sweeping changes 
-- would carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, which will take effect Oct. 1, women still would be barred 
from direct ground combat assignments. But they no longer would be excluded 
from assignments because they are dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Although preliminary figures were sketchy, the Army estimated that the change 
eventually could open an additional 7,000 jobs to women on active duty and 
11,000 more slots in the reserve and National Guard. The Marine Corps had no 
comparable estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials said that the two services probably would not decide until 
early May specifically which jobs would be opened to women. Thursday's order 
merely directed them to open up more noncombat slots to women and to work out 
the details by May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulation was part of a continuing effort by outgoing Defense 
Secretary Les Aspin to broaden opportunities for women in the service. Last 
April, Aspin opened the way for women to serve as combat pilots and to serve in 
more sea-going billets in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper reflects last-minute adjustments ordered by Aspin, who had feared 
that an earlier draft might have allowed the Army and Marine Corps to reduce 
the number of jobs available to women. The two services had heavily influenced 
the writing of the document. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference called to announce the new policy, Aspin said that he had 
discussed the order with the man named to be his successor, Adm. Bobby Ray 
Inman, and that Inman effectively had endorsed the plan. "So there is no 
disconnect," Aspin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Army Maj. Lillian Pfluke, a 1980 West Point graduate who has served for 13 
1/2 years as an ordnance officer, expressed skepticism about whether the 
services would fully carry out the spirit of Aspin's new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Aspin has done great things for women in the service but I am very 
apprehensive" about how far the services will go in filling in the details on 
the policy, Pfluke said. "The key to this is in the interpretation and it is 
very, very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Binkin, a Brookings Institution military manpower expert, agreed. 
Binkin said that the latest policy is "not a radical departure from what 
previously had been in place. I'm not sure it's going to open up that many 
opportunities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as soon as Aspin completed his announcement, the Army issued a 
statement saying that it had decided to allow women to serve in a variety of 
combat support jobs, ranging from chemical warfare reconnaissance units to 
division-level military police. 
</P>
<P>
 But the service said that it would continue to bar women from serving in field 
artillery and multiple-launch rocket system crews and in some aviation slots 
because such jobs would bring them too close to the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The push to open more jobs to women in all four services has been under way 
since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when women served successfully throughout the 
combat zone in jobs as truck drivers, mechanics and as helicopter pilots -- 
often entailing as much risk as infantry troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the steps that Aspin has taken on his own, Congress voted last summer 
to eliminate a longstanding rule that had prohibited women from serving on 
combat vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy Secretary John H. Dalton has announced plans to begin assigning women to 
aircraft carriers this year.

 A train carrying circus performers and animals derailed Thursday at a 
crossing, killing two people and injuring 14 others, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen cars jumped the tracks shortly after 9 a.m. as the 53-car train 
traveled across Florida from St. Petersburg to Orlando, where the Ringling 
Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus was to open tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show always goes on. I suspect we will be late, but the show always goes 
on," said David Cohen, the circus manager and a passenger on the train. 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore Svertesky, 39, an elephant trainer, was killed in a housing car, Polk 
County Sheriff's Maj. Grady Judd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceslee Conkling, 28, who performed as a clown, was found dead in another car. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen circus workers were treated at a hospital and released. None of the 
25 children on board was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars that jumped the tracks carried staff, performers and equipment, said 
circus spokesman Rodney Huey.

RENO BEGINS HUNT FOR WHITEWATER COUNSEL; INQUIRY: ATTORNEY GENERAL IS 
INFORMALLY QUESTIONING COLLEAGUES ABOUT CANDIDATES. FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY IS 
UNDER 'SERIOUS CONSIDERATION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno on Thursday launched what aides described as a highly 
personal search for a special counsel to investigate the role of President 
Clinton and his wife in the Whitewater real estate and banking affair, asking 
Justice Department colleagues about possible candidates for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 While some officials want a counsel to be selected by the end of the week, 
Justice Department sources cited the time-consuming inquiries that would have 
to be conducted for any potential conflicts in a prospect's legal practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to pick the special counsel and then have the individual 
forced to withdraw because you find out he represented savings and loans in 
Arkansas," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, one official said he would not rule out the possibility that 
Reno could make a selection this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among candidates said to be under "serious consideration" are Dan K. Webb, a 
former Ronald Reagan Administration U.S. attorney. Webb caught attention with 
his dogged questioning of the ex-President in videotaped testimony during the 
Iran-Contra investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's also the retired-judge category," said a department official familiar 
with the search. "But there's concern about picking a person who can really hit 
the ground running and a retired judge may not fit that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll probably pick a white male Republican over the age of 55, probably 
some retired judge," said Victoria Toensing, a former deputy assistant attorney 
general. "That seems to be the image of what they're looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons invested in the Whitewater Development Corp., an Ozark Mountain 
vacation resort, with a friend, James B. McDougal, and his wife, Susan, in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal owned Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, an Arkansas thrift that was 
seized by federal regulators in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of at least $47.6 
million. The real estate deal went sour as well and the Clintons, by their 
account, lost $68,900. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have questioned whether the Clintons may have benefited improperly 
from the relationship or whether the savings and loan was permitted to operate 
longer than it should have because of friendship between the Clintons and 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials insisted Thursday that Reno had no advance 
knowledge that the White House would ask her to reverse her oft-stated position 
and name a special counsel, saying that she learned of the decision officially 
only 10 minutes before it was announced on television. Thus, she had no list of 
prospects at hand, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said early Thursday that 
Clinton made the decision to seek a special counsel after conferring Tuesday 
night with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and senior aides in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President slept on it overnight and decided to go forward," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers interested in the job, including a former assistant attorney general 
during the Gerald R. Ford Administration, sent resumes to Justice Department 
acquaintances with the expectation that they would be sent on to the attorney 
general. Those who could cited their Republican credentials on the theory that 
Reno is unlikely to choose a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 One prominent Republican proposed the name of a well-known Florida attorney to 
a department official, but the name was not passed on because the individual 
was a longtime associate -- and a one-time employer -- of Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, Reno informally sought information about potential 
candidates from officials who stopped by her office. In one case, when 
information she gleaned seemingly met with her approval, she asked the official 
who supplied it to contact the candidate in question to find out about his 
availability and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 While the search progressed, congressional Republicans on Thursday continued 
their calls for legislative investigations into the Whitewater affair. But 
Democrats remained cautiously optimistic that they could maintain enough party 
unity to quash those demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large the members appear pretty satisfied with the special (counsel)," 
said one House leadership aide. But the aide added that if new revelations 
surface, "things could change on a dime." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on several morning television shows Thursday, Rep. Jim Leach 
(R-Iowa), the GOP point man on the issue, insisted that congressional hearings 
are necessary to provide "full disclosure" for the public. "Hearings are a 
better way of letting the public understand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Pinder, an aide to Leach, said the Republican staff on the House Banking, 
Finance and Urban Affairs Committee would continue its own investigation into 
the tangled financial affair. He also said Republicans would seek to force a 
recorded vote on whether to conduct congressional hearings, either through the 
Banking Committee or a special select committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody will force a vote on this one way or the other, and you tell me who 
is going to vote against it," Pinder said. 
</P>
<P>
 But aides to several freshman Democrats on the Banking Committee -- considered 
by both the GOP and the House leadership as the most likely to support an 
independent investigation -- said Thursday they will be satisfied with the 
appointment of a special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Scofield, an aide to Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, said the Illinois Democrat 
believes that "the idea of a special prosecutor is to take politics out of it. 
So why have a committee get involved?" 
</P>
<P>
 Republican strategists said their best chance to change that dynamic would 
come if further revelations raise new doubts about the Clintons' behavior in 
the case.

N.Y. STATE POLICE CHIEF IS PICKED TO HEAD DEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling him "street-smart, tough and an able administrator," the Clinton 
Administration on Thursday nominated New York State Police Supt. Thomas A. 
Constantine to head the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 At a ceremony at the agency's headquarters in Virginia, Constantine, 55, said 
he began his career as a 20-year-old cadet living in a police barracks and 
worked his way up through the ranks to head the 4,800-member state police 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that people do not have to be victims of crime. I abhor bullies and 
I abhor predators," he said in explaining why he chose police work. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he looks forward to heading the nation's lead agency in the 
fight against the "tyranny of violence" caused by illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a degradation caused by drugs and violence that I would never have 
thought possible when I started in law enforcement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said Constantine's selection was a testament to the way 
in which he "brilliantly led and administered an agency slightly larger than 
the DEA." About 3,700 DEA agents are deployed in all 50 states and 53 other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Constantine appears to have emerged unscathed from an evidence-tampering 
scandal within the New York state police force. Since 1992, three troopers have 
pleaded guilty to falsifying fingerprints and three others have come under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Said to be stunned by the news, Constantine called it the worst scandal to hit 
the state police force, and he has been credited since then with working 
effectively to weed out corrupt troopers.  
</P>
<P>
 Substituting for President Clinton, who was in Moscow for the summit, Vice 
President Al Gore praised Constantine as the "very best" person for the job, 
someone whose career has been marked by "sheer professionalism and a commitment 
to excellence. He's also got heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Gore's "reinventing government" project had suggested last summer 
that the Justice Department merge the DEA into the FBI. Both Gore and Reno were 
concerned about overlap and lack of coordination between the several agencies 
that deal with narcotics.

VENTURA SCHOOL OFFICIALS SAY COACH HAD SEX WITH STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura High School's swimming coach had sex with two female students and made 
advances and sexually suggestive comments to others, school officials said in a 
document filed Thursday with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dale Hahn also raised the grade of one of the girls he slept with to an 
A when it should have been a C or a D, according to the formal list of 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the document accuses him of once discussing sex with his 
chemistry class for an entire period and purchasing alcohol for students, and 
recounts how he was warned repeatedly about yelling profanities while coaching 
the water polo and swim teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn, who has been on paid leave since December, said Thursday, "There is 
nothing I want to say" about the allegations. His lawyer insisted there is no 
merit to the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police said they began an investigation of Hahn after they were 
contacted by school officials last month. Sgt. Bob Anderson said detectives 
plan to begin interviews in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations mark the second sex scandal at Ventura High School in the past 
18 months. Football Coach Harvey Kochel, who had won more games than any coach 
in the school's history, was convicted in January, 1993, of having unlawful sex 
with a 15-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn, 44, has taught science and coached swimming at Ventura High for 20 
years. He is divorced and has two sons, said Richard Schwab, his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-page list of 90 allegations by the Ventura Unified School District was 
filed with the state Office of Administrative Hearings on Thursday as the 
district's first step toward firing Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Mary Jo McGrath said she was hired by the school district to 
investigate Hahn after a female student told another Ventura High teacher of 
flirtatious comments Hahn allegedly had made. 
</P>
<P>
 The document said Hahn asked the girl, "Have you ever considered going out 
with me?"  
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said she found a former student who allegedly had a sexual 
relationship with Hahn when she was a senior, in the 1988-89 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 A male student told investigators that a female friend said she had slept with 
Hahn last fall, the document said.

ENROLLMENT DROPS 8% AT STATE PUBLIC COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enrollment in California public colleges and universities decreased 8% in the 
past year because of student fee increases, fewer class offerings and budget 
cuts, a San Jose-based research group reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop of more than 160,000 students was the steepest for any state and 
shows that the "message of discouragement" is replacing the historic open-door 
promise at California community colleges, Cal State and the University of 
California, said Patrick M. Callan, executive director of the California Higher 
Education Policy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Callan said statistics collected by the nonprofit center show that enrollment 
in the three systems dropped from 2,030,238 in fall, 1992, to 1,868,553 last 
fall. The community colleges lost 137,000, Cal State 22,000 and UC 2,700, the 
center found. 
</P>
<P>
 Total enrollment in the state's colleges and universities began to decline 
three years ago. Callan blamed this academic year's losses on the stiff 
increase in student fees and institutional downsizing, which has prompted 
community colleges and some Cal State campuses to discontinue class offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 Callan also said it was significant that the number of high school students 
taking college eligibility courses has declined, even as the high school 
population is increasing.

FOSSIL REVEALS ANCIENT WHALE WAS ABLE TO MOVE ON LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Researchers have found the fossil remains of an ancient relative of the whale 
that was able to propel itself on land. 
</P>
<P>
 "This critter is a missing link between land animals and modern whales," said 
J.G.M. Thewissen, a paleobiologist at Northeastern Ohio Universities College of 
Medicine in Rootstown, Ohio. "It is a very complete specimen and has enough of 
the anatomy to teach us something about how the animal moved on land." 
</P>
<P>
 A report on the discovery is to be published today in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
 Thewissen said the fossil was found in deposits left by an ancient sea that 
once existed in Pakistan. Fossils found nearby suggest that the whale died 
about 50 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was about the size of a big male sea lion and probably weighed 600 to 700 
pounds," Thewissen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fossils of the land-dwelling ancestors of the modern whale have been 
found, but Thewissen said this is the first with enough fossils of the legs, 
vertebrae and tail to show how the animal was able to move on land and in the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal, which Thewissen calls Ambulocetus natans, had large rear feet with 
fully developed legs. In front, the feet are short, stubby and joined almost to 
the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the whale moved by bumping along on its chest and abdomen, 
lifting itself just enough to lurch forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambulocetus natans had the teeth of a carnivore, but because it was so awkward 
on land it probably was unable to catch prey out of the water. For this reason, 
Thewissen speculates that the whale ancestor lived on marine life, as do modern 
whales. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern whales are thought to have developed from animals that lived on land 
and slowly, over thousands of generations, evolved to the oceangoing mammal 
known today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The oldest skeleton that is a marine whale is about 40 million years old," 
Thewissen said. That skeleton is 40 to 50 feet long and had tiny hind feet 
inadequate for moving on land. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambulocetus natans lived about 10 million years before that, but Thewissen 
said there are a number of missing links in the evolutionary chain to the 
modern whale.

DEFENSIVE DRIVING; VEHICLES: A CAR FOR ROAD WARRIORS IS UNVEILED AT L.A. AUTO 
SHOW. ITS LOOKS ARE PLAIN -- LIKE A RETOOLED POLICE CAR -- BUT IT'S DESIGNED TO 
LEAVE OCCUPANTS UNSCATHED EVEN AFTER A HAIL OF GUNFIRE. 
</P>

<P>
 So it has come to this, finally, ultimately, inevitably. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked away in a remote exhibition hall at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, 
showcased by a snappy backdrop of graffiti and razor wire, looms the Defender, 
a car made in Los Angeles, for Los Angeles, a car you can drive to the 
apocalypse and supposedly live to tell the tale. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the ultimate car for the true urban warrior, or the truly paranoid, or 
any variation thereof. All for a price that the masses might be able to afford. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defender's base price, including cellular phone and no-sweat leather 
steering wheel (for white-knuckle grips) is only $12,777. For a bulletproof 
version, add another $20,000, more or less. 
</P>
<P>
 The other guys (yes, there is a competitive market for this stuff) say that 
once you supply the car, they'll bulletproof it for maybe $70,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal was to build an economical, utilitarian beginning point for the 
average person that will give maximum reliability in any environment," says 
Marcus Hays, who designed the thing. "Remember, reliability means security." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Defender -- no relation to the comparatively effete Defender made by 
Land Rover -- is not what you would expect. Which, you see, is the point. This 
is the '90s, when ostentation is not only unfashionable, it could get you 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Defender is a retooled, reinforced cop car -- with such options as a 
retractable bullet screen behind the grille (prevents debilitating hits to the 
radiator) and "run-flat" tires (allows high-speed getaways even when riddled 
with bullets) -- that will win no beauty prize. It's ugly, or maybe you'd just 
call it plain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly!" Hays says, squealing, practically jumping up and down. Hays is one 
of three partners who own Performance Coachworks. Their small Chatsworth 
factory is where the Defenders emerge from the bodies of 1990 Chevrolet 9C-1 
Police Interceptors, heretofore unavailable for sale to the public.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old company has reportedly armored everything from Cadillacs to 
Mercedeses to Fords until they would suit the likes of James Bond or Mad Max. 
</P>
<P>
 (Note to the uninitiated, the innocent and the old school: In '90s U.S. 
security lingo, an armored vehicle is sleek, not a military tin can. Level 2 
will repel 9-millimeter bullets, Level 3 will stop a .44 magnum, and a Level 4 
is supposed to beat out NATO rounds.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not attract attention," Hays says of his Defender, which is making 
its world debut this week at the Los Angeles Convention Center. "This is for 
people who want to get from point A to point B without fanfare. It's 
essentially an armored taxicab." 
</P>
<P>
 Other descriptions, too, spring to mind. This is the evil cousin of the 
battered Volkswagen with a hand-lettered sign letting crooks know the radio is 
already gone. This is a car that doesn't shout, but gravely hints, "Beware." 
</P>
<P>
 "You drive Wilshire at rush hour onto the freeway, people will yield and wave 
you through," Hays says, citing one of his many research and development runs 
on the streets of L.A. He hasn't exactly impersonated an officer, but people do 
tend to think he is The Law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take high-speed runs on the freeways, keep entirely in the left lane and 
gauge other vehicles' reactions. I've never been ticketed, but I've gotten a 
lot of salutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only car where people run from me when I operate it. So it's a 
good starting point. Of course, it's a double-edged sword. Police have been 
shot at in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 And you don't even have to wear the optional Tactical Night Finder goggles to 
get that effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the car's manufacturers think the Defender is going to be big, 
especially in Los Angeles, and even among those who have never seen a "Road 
Warrior" movie in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the weekend, we almost needed oxygen to breathe, there were so many 
people around here," said Performance Coachworks partner Andrew Alenick, who's 
on the financial end. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently no other company in this specialized security market has come up 
with a model designed for everyday people who might equate a jaunt to the ATM 
with, say, a British diplomat's call on the IRA.  
</P>
<P>
 Another local company that armors vehicles, Fountain Valley's Classic 
International Armoring, is sticking with the very high-end crowd for now. A 
spokesman says the company does a lot of work for the Saudi royal family. Their 
cheapo goes for about $40,000, and top of the line will set you back $170,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Cincinnati, Bill O'Gara, president of the nation's largest and oldest 
armored-vehicle manufacturer, O'Gara Hess & Eisenhardt, says his company saw 
the trend for the domestic market in the mid-'80s and designed its Personal 
Security Vehicle, which was "geared to prevent against random acts of violence, 
the smash and runs." 
</P>
<P>
 But because his company is not used to retail, O'Gara says they had trouble 
filling the initial 25 to 30 orders and gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 Then about two years ago, O'Gara says the worried calls started coming again. 
The Los Angeles riots, the Exxon kidnaping and a particularly heinous 
carjacking in the suburbs of Washington sparked renewed demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first we didn't do anything," says O'Gara, who tools around in an 
unarmored Volvo himself. "I guess we hoped it would go away. But we kept 
receiving phone calls, so we took a package that had been sent to Brazil, which 
was having a kidnaping problem, and repackaged it and called it the Personal 
Security Vehicle 2." 
</P>
<P>
 He says the company sold 25 armored PSV-2s last year. The prices range from 
$40,000 to $70,000 and that doesn't include the price of the car -- Jeeps are 
big -- which the customer supplies. Bulletproofing takes about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, O'Gara says his company is working with major car 
manufacturers to find ways to incorporate some security measures, such as 
protection on the side front windows, into cars you'll one day be able to buy 
on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which is good news to the guys at Performance Coachworks, who say they 
are working on something they call the Eluder, which will be geared to those 
who like a real performance car. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Defender, they stress, is any slouch. Hays says he has tentative 
orders from 100 people who have seen the Defender at the auto show. 
</P>
<P>
 And a representative for a police force in a foreign capital (one you've 
definitely heard of but which can't be mentioned here) smiles mysteriously when 
asked about his plans to pick up 300 of the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will say that in the United States, even though they are not law 
enforcement, these cars will give more police presence on the street," he says 
as he stands next to the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that people are going to steal," adds passerby Rene 
Balderrama, who seems sold on the Defender even without a test drive. "And it's 
economical to work on." Balderrama drives a Mercedes now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look at it!" gushes Raul Gonzalez, who drives his Buick from Laguna 
Hills to Downtown Los Angeles every workday. "People will stay away from it. It 
looks like an official car. And you go look at a $280,000 Aston-Martin and it 
has a rubber hose (under the hood.) This has steel lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Hays touts such ruggedness as an integral part of the Defender's appeal, 
noting that the last thing you want on the freeway is a hose coming loose. With 
regular, routine servicing, he claims the car will last 350,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 But where a safety-conscious Volvo plays up the crash dummies big, Performance 
Coachworks is planning a slightly different approach to calm an anxious 
public's security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To coincide with a planned first meeting of the Defender owners club in two 
months, the company will make a video that it predicts will become an important 
sales tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get four water-filled dummies and then riddle the car with a 
variety of weaponry," Hays says. "Then we're going to remove the dummies and 
see if they spring any leaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that such a pitch was working on every visitor eyeing the Defender at the 
auto show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't consider buying it, because I live in a nice suburb," said Rod 
McInnis, who drives a '66 Mustang. "Upland. It's the city of gracious living." 
</P>
<P>
 "You really don't need it if you don't drive in the wrong neighborhoods," said 
his friend, Scott MacKay. "It's a sad testament to our society -- or else a 
cheap way to make a buck."

SKINHEADS GET PRISON FOR BOMBINGS, PLOT; COURTS: CHRISTOPHER DAVID FISHER, 20, 
IS SENTENCED TO MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS AND CARL DANIEL BOESE, 17, RECEIVES ABOUT 
FIVE YEARS. GROUP HAD PLANNED TO BOMB FIRST AME CHURCH.

<P>
 A federal judge Thursday sentenced one member of the Fourth Reich Skinheads to 
nearly five years in prison and another to more than eight years, brusquely 
dismissing claims that they never meant to hurt anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were sending absolutely the wrong message," U.S. District Judge William 
Matthew Byrne Jr. said of Christopher David Fisher, 20, and Carl Daniel Boese, 
17. "Hopefully, what occurs in this courtroom sends a different kind of 
message." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, who received the longer sentence, and Boese were leaders of a group of 
skinheads who used pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails on a number of residences 
and synagogues and who plotted an attack on the historic First African 
Methodist Episcopal Church in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The skinheads hoped that their attacks would help spark a race war, but an FBI 
agent and informant had infiltrated the group. Agents arrested three members in 
July -- an event that captured national attention. The third suspect is 
awaiting trial in state court. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents of both young men were in the courtroom Thursday, and Fisher cried 
as he tried to explain his actions to the the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last six months, I've had a lot of time to soul-search and think about 
what I've done," he said, as his mother and father bowed their heads and his 
younger brother watched with rapt attention. "I don't think that I would have 
done that attack on the AME Church, but I can't deny the seriousness of what we 
said." 
</P>
<P>
 Boese displayed no emotion, insisting that he "never wanted to hurt anybody" 
and only sought to "do good." When Byrne announced his sentences, Boese 
shrugged and glanced over his shoulder at his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of Simon Wiesenthal Center, said the 
judge's sentences -- 57 months for Boese and 97 months for Fisher, followed by 
three years' supervised release for both -- would have the right effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious sentence and a very sobering one," said Cooper, who was 
one of the organizers of a series of counseling sessions that the skinheads 
attended last month. "Today's sentence is a message that society is going to 
take this kind of conduct seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher and Boese pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and as part of those 
pleas agreed to accept sentences slightly longer than those imposed by Byrne. 
The judge said federal sentencing guidelines forced him to give out shorter 
sentences than he might have imposed, but that he selected the longest sentence 
that he believed he could justify legally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sentence, of necessity, needs to be severe," Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Marc R. Greenberg, who prosecuted the case, said he was 
satisfied with the sentences. Lawyer Anna Ho, who represented Fisher, said an 
appeal of her client's sentence is under consideration. Corey House, Boese's 
attorney, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho and House had argued that short prison terms, combined with intensive 
counseling, would be enough to teach their clients a lesson without ruining 
their chances for rehabilitation. Boese and Fisher have undergone three days of 
innovative counseling organized by Greenberg and a number of prominent African 
American and Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that counseling, Fisher, Boese and other members of the Fourth 
Reich Skinheads met a federal judge, discussed their views with student 
counselors, met with two Holocaust survivors and, for the first time, sat down 
with the Rev. Cecil Murray, pastor of First AME Church and the target of one of 
their assassination plots. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting with Murray was especially emotional and ended with the minister, 
Boese and Fisher in tears. Murray forgave the youths and said later that he 
believed the meeting had a profound effect on all the participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg was the force behind the counseling program, and he received a 
letter this week from Fisher thanking him. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, who first addressed the letter to "Mark Greenbird," before scratching 
out the last name and spelling it correctly, wrote: "As far as I go, will 
probably never see you again because I'm staying out of trouble and trying very 
hard to get a job. . . . I'll just keep this short and just say, 'Thank you 
Mark Greenberg, I appreciate what you've done' and my deepest apologies for 
what I've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher also expressed his appreciation for the counseling sessions in a letter 
to Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
 "God has forgiven me. Cecil Murray has forgiven me," Fisher wrote. "I am 
working on forgiving myself. I can only pray that society can forgive me too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Thursday's hearing, Greenberg said he believes that Fisher has shown 
remorse and a genuine desire to change. But the prosecutor was less impressed 
by Boese's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's as bad, if not worse, than he was when he was arrested," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 House acknowledged that her client's racial views, which were captured on 
audio and videotape recorders during the undercover investigation, were 
"distasteful and heinous." She described Boese as very immature emotionally and 
said he had told a psychologist that he imagined that once he was in prison, he 
would have the chance to engage in philosophical discussions about race with 
other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 House called that a distorted fantasy of prison life. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their arguments for leniency, the lawyers for Fisher and Boese 
urged the judge to help them arrange for the defendants to serve their 
sentences in minimum-security prisons. The combination of their clients' ages, 
their notoriety and their association with racist views could otherwise subject 
Boese and Fisher to harm while in custody, the attorneys argued. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One doctor who examined Fisher warned that putting him into the general prison 
population could endanger his safety and chances for rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would promptly be taken over and thus protected by the white supremacists 
(perhaps with sexual subjugation as the price)," Louis Jolyon West wrote of 
Fisher. "The alternative might be his death by assassination." 
</P>
<P>
 Although judges cannot usually request a prison assignment for the defendants 
they sentence, Byrne agreed to meet with attorneys and to consider drafting a 
special request to the Bureau of Prisons. Greenberg said prosecutors had no 
objection to that arrangement, and Byrne scheduled a hearing for next week. 
</P>
<P>
 As Thursday's hearing concluded, Boese and his family quickly left the 
courtroom, declining comment as they hustled through the courthouse corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, who has been in custody since his arrest, was allowed to speak briefly 
with his father before he was escorted away by U.S. marshals. Fisher was 
shackled and handcuffed and led from the courtroom. His girlfriend, who has 
attended many of the hearings, waved a tearful farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love you," she said as he passed, flanked by marshals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love you too," Fisher responded.

COALITION ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR AIDS MEMORIAL WALL ON EASTSIDE; HEALTH: 
SUPPORTERS HOPE THE MONUMENT WILL BREAK DOWN A 'WALL OF DENIAL' IN LATINO 
COMMUNITY ABOUT THE DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans were announced Thursday for "The Wall -- Las Memorias," a proposed 
memorial to be built on Los Angeles' Eastside to alert the Latino community to 
the deadly threat of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Escareno, whose 25-year-old daughter died of AIDS, hopes to see it built 
soon "so that grandmothers won't have to hear their 3-year-old grandson asking, 
'When is my mother coming home?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The monument has yet to be designed or funded, but Escareno was on hand to 
express hope that the project will "break down the wall of denial" over AIDS in 
the Latino community. Newly reported cases of AIDS are increasing faster among 
Latinos in Los Angeles than in any other ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of all AIDS cases reported in the county in 1993 were among Latinos, 
up from about one-fifth in 1988, according to preliminary county health 
department figures. Last year in the county there were 548 deaths of Latinos 
with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles joined gay organizations and 
local groups and officials, including City Councilmen Richard Alatorre and Mike 
Hernandez, in endorsing the project at the proposed site of the memorial, Plaza 
de la Raza in Lincoln Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial is envisioned as a semicircular wall with murals depicting Latino 
culture and listing 2,000 Latinos who have died of AIDS. Planners hope to 
sponsor a contest in local high schools to select designs for the murals. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that Latinas account for a disproportionately high share of the 
women countywide who have AIDS or the human immunodeficiency virus that causes 
the deadly disease, and that many are passing the virus to their babies during 
pregnancy. Forty-two percent of the children in the county who have AIDS are 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials believe those statistics reveal only part of the problem. 
Latinos, more than any other group, seek treatment only in the late stages of 
the disease, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say ignorance, denial, shame and cultural and religious biases all 
contribute heavily to the spread of AIDS. Another factor is that illegal 
immigrants fear capture and deportation and do not seek testing or care for 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go to a funeral on the Eastside and ask what did the person die of . 
. . sometimes (you're met with) silence," said Richard Zaldivar, an El Sereno 
activist leading the effort to build the memorial. "We're not supposed to have 
this disease on the Eastside. We always believed it belonged on the other side 
of town. But that's not true anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Father Peter Liuzzi, the archdiocese's liaison to the lesbian and gay 
community, said he hopes the monument will "educate and sensitize the Latino 
community about the reality of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Catholic Church is committed to education and prevention and outreach of 
compassion and solidarity with those who are infected by this disease," said 
Liuzzi, who has lost two cousins to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that warnings often are in English rather than Spanish, 
said Dr. Aliza Lifshitz of the County AIDS Commission. Seeking to change that, 
federal health officials last week released controversial new commercials -- in 
English and Spanish -- that promote condom use to reduce the risk of AIDS 
transmission. Officials hope the public service announcements will be broadcast 
on stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, the Latino community has always organized against enemies, 
such as immigration raids, social injustice and discrimination," said Herbert 
Siguenza of the comedy group Culture Clash. "AIDS is our new enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know a lover, a relative, a friend who has died of AIDS," he said. 
"And if you don't, you will."

ACLU WEIGHS SEGREGATION OF PITCHESS INMATES; JAIL: GROUP SAYS SEPARATION OF 
LATINO AND BLACK PRISONERS MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO STOP RACIAL FIGHTS AT THE 
COUNTY LOCKUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a history of staunch opposition to racial segregation, American Civil 
Liberties Union leaders said Thursday that keeping blacks and Latinos apart in 
Los Angeles County jails may be the only way to defuse explosive tension that 
has erupted into prisoner brawls in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the compelling state interest of keeping prisoners free of harm, 
we believe it might be constitutionally permissible" to separate black and 
Latino inmates, said Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Local ACLU legal director Paul Hoffman said he agreed and that the ACLU is 
examining the constitutional ramifications of such a policy at the request of 
the county Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Although top Sheriff's Department officials said they are not yet seriously 
considering long-term segregation, they acknowledged that they asked Ripston, 
Hoffman and other ACLU officials Tuesday to discuss the feasibility of enacting 
such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting came in response to the largest brawl at the mammoth Peter J. 
Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic. As many as 1,000 inmates rioted for hours 
Sunday, swinging homemade knives and broken broomsticks at each other. Eighty 
inmates were injured, including 24 who were taken to hospitals, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, fights have broken out between blacks and Latinos at court lockups 
in the county and at Pitchess. The two groups have been kept mostly separate, 
and both sides have warned that more fighting will occur if they are put 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, two African American inmates broke free of their handcuffs and 
injured six Latino and white inmates who were shackled as a bus carried 55 
prisoners to San Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of keeping the Castaic facility segregated has weighed heavily 
with Sheriff's Department officials. They say they do not want to resort to 
such drastic measures, but are in the untenable position of trying to force 
inmates to get along. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Robert J. Spierer, who is in charge of the facility, confirmed that the 
department asked the ACLU to meet and discuss the issue. But he said the 
department still believes that segregating the inmates would be bad policy and 
possibly unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a policy also would be a procedural nightmare, he said, because of the 
number of inmates -- about 21,000 countywide -- and the fact that so many need 
to be transported from the Pitchess facility to courthouses every day. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Spierer said, the department has resisted calls for segregation 
for years, even though racially motivated fights have been commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, if that is the only way we can protect the inmates, then we will 
have to consider it," Spierer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spierer said jail officials are trying to slowly re-integrate inmates at 
Pitchess by moving troublemakers to other wings and buildings and by moving in 
new inmates. He said the department considers permanent segregation potentially 
dangerous because it would allow blacks and Latinos to devise plans to attack 
each other when put together in non-segregated holding tanks and buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ACLU has long opposed nearly all types of segregation, Ripston 
and Hoffman said it was the seriousness of the problem -- and the prolonged 
nature of the racial conflict -- that caused the civil rights organization to 
re-examine its position.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK; MAN GETS LIFE 
IN 2 KILLINGS AFTER ROSEBUSH DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Burbank man who shot two women to death and wounded two others in a rampage 
touched off by a verdict in a dispute over the pruning of a rosebush was 
sentenced Thursday to life in prison without the possibility of parole -- and 
an additional 17 years to precede the life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that Thomas Paul Humenik, 27, displayed a high degree of cruelty, 
Pasadena Superior Court Judge Thomas W. Stoever stopped just short of issuing 
the maximum allowable sentence of 19 years and four months in addition to life. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a jury found Humenik guilty of one count of first-degree murder, 
one count of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, a verdict 
that made Humenik eligible for the death penalty. However, that jury 
recommended life in prison without the possibility of parole, precluding 
Stoever from issuing the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings occurred on the same day in 1992 that Humenik was found guilty of 
misdemeanor battery against Don Boyd, his 75-year-old neighbor. Boyd said he 
was pruning roses between their two houses when Humenik accosted him. Humenik 
was put on probation and fined $810. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony in the murder trial, soon after Humenik returned home 
from court, he went into his bedroom to get a rifle as the four victims 
gathered on Boyd's patio. Boyd's wife, Merle, 73, was one of the two killed.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LAPD 
OFFICER CHARGED WITH RAPE AT GUNPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 12-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department was charged Wednesday 
with raping a woman at gunpoint on a San Pedro street while off duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Gerber, 42, was arrested at his home Wednesday afternoon after police 
investigated a claim by a 33-year-old woman that he had forced her "to commit 
an illegal sexual act" with him on West 7th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Cmdr. Dave Gascon said that the woman reported the crime immediately to 
Harbor Division police, who traced Gerber through his car license plate. Gerber 
is a patrol officer in that division. 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon said Gerber was not in uniform "and his employment was not a factor in 
the crime." Gerber was scheduled to be arraigned this morning in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court on charges of kidnaping for a sexual purpose and felony 
assault.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 2 AIDES TO 
MAYOR RIORDAN FORCED OUT OF THEIR JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two aides to Mayor Richard Riordan were forced out this week, bringing to five 
the number of mayoral assistants to leave in the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we go along there will be people coming and going," said chief of staff 
William McCarley."Organizations change over time. That happens in a healthy 
dynamic organization." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarley disputed suggestions among some workers in City Hall that the mayor's 
office was losing its ethnic diversity with the loss of Asian, African American 
and Latino aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Garfield, assistant deputy mayor for public safety, submitted his 
letter of resignation Thursday, effective Feb. 24, after being told to seek 
another position. Assistant press secretary Tom Kruesopon was also forced out. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who have left include Deputy Mayor Jadine Nielson, who was Riordan's 
campaign manager; Deputy Mayor Al Villalobos, who faced questions about his 
business dealings, and Janice Berman, director of intergovernmental affairs.

 Long Beach police officers shot and killed a gun-waving motorist Wednesday 
afternoon after he crashed his car into two other vehicles, then jumped out and 
pulled the weapon, a Police Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Karen Kerr said the man, who had not yet been identified, drove a mile 
down the wrong side of Atlantic Boulevard before slamming into the other cars 
and injuring their occupants.Police were told by bystanders that the man was 
brandishing a gun at the crash site at Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were scores of people at the intersection, including a lot of children 
from a nearby school, and he was alternately raising and lowering the gun, 
fingering it and pointing it at the crowd," Kerr said. "And when the officers 
arrived, he refused to put it down although they ordered him in English and 
Spanish to put it down. That's when the officers fired."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
NEW CHALLENGES MOUNTED TO LANDFILL EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The complicated legal maneuvering surrounding the proposed expansion of 
Sunshine Canyon landfill dragged on this week with new challenges from Los 
Angeles city officials and San Fernando Valley homeowners -- including a 
request for the dump operator to pick up its opponents' legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Expansion of the dump north of Granada Hills was attacked on a number of 
fronts in legal documents, adding new dimensions to the complex fight that has 
been waged in courtrooms and hearing rooms for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 A 58-page petition filed by the city and the North Valley Coalition of 
Concerned Citizens seeks to overturn the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors' third approval of the dump expansion last November. Two prior 
approvals were overturned by judges on technical grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether to allow the now-idle landfill just north of Granada Hills 
to expand by 17 million tons as part of a 10-year plan to increase the county's 
waste disposal capacity. The dump has been closed since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Most issues raised in the petition are longstanding complaints of negligence 
and oversight that dump opponents have leveled for years against the county and 
the landfill's operator, Browning-Ferris Industries.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WACHS 
CALLS FOR 'SUMMIT' ON LOW POLICE MORALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Councilman Joel Wachs has called for a "summit" meeting of city and 
community leaders in an attempt to resolve the problem of low morale in the 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs's proposal was in response to reports that police -- frustrated by the 
lack of a pay raise and perceived lack of support from superiors -- are issuing 
fewer citations and submitting poorly investigated cases to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs said he hopes to bring together Mayor Richard Riordan, police officers, 
citizen groups, the police commissioner and others in an attempt to improve pay 
and working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley councilman suggested that officers should be given a 
raise and better equipment, but did not say how he would pay for those 
improvements.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; MAN PLEADS 
NOT GUILTY IN 3 HALLOWEEN SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A reputed gang member arrested in the Halloween slayings of three Pasadena 
teen-agers has pleaded not guilty to murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon Bowen, 22, offered the plea in the shooting deaths of Reggie Crawford, 
14; Stephen Coats Jr., 14, and Edgar Evans, 13, who were gunned down as they 
were leaving a Halloween party. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men earlier pleaded not guilty in the case, and police are searching for 
a fifth suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the five mistakenly shot the youths -- who had no known gang ties 
-- while seeking retaliation for the fatal shooting of a fellow gang member a 
few hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys were in a group of 10 walking home from a party about 10 p.m. when 
gunmen jumped from bushes and started shooting. Three other boys were wounded.

PROPOSAL TO CLOSE UCLA NURSING SCHOOL ASSAILED AT HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's medical community came out in force Thursday night to attack 
efforts by UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young to abolish the university's 
undergraduate School of Nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the critics at a hearing on the budget-driven proposal to cut the 
nursing school were the administrator of a Skid Row mission, state nursing 
regulators, numerous representatives of hospitals and health maintenance 
organizations and local physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Young announced the proposal, which would also reduce graduate nursing 
programs, last June as part of a package of budget cuts to downsize and 
restructure programs in the schools of nursing, architecture, public health, 
library science and social welfare. He hopes to save $8 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus hearing on the nursing program was the first of several planned by 
ad hoc committees of the university's Academic Senate, which makes 
recommendations to the chancellor. Although Young is not bound to follow the 
recommendations, they are expected to heavily influence his decision, which is 
due by July 1, the start of the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget plan calls for a cut of $1.3 million in the nursing school's 
$3.1-million annual operating budget.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend that abolishing undergraduate nursing runs counter to national 
health reform efforts to increase the number of advanced-practice nurses. They 
say it would jeopardize two UCLA clinics run by nurses on Downtown's Skid Row 
and would leave Los Angeles County hospitals with a big hole to fill at a time 
when other nursing schools are turning away students because their classes are 
full. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard J. Steckel, director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer 
Center, said the proposed budget cuts "will have Draconian effects." 
</P>
<P>
 Steckel also told the hearing that the proposal "flies in the face of a 
national trend and a national need, and one which a research university like 
ours is best suited to meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Takahashi, a nurse and a consultant to the state Board of Registered 
Nursing, called the plan shortsighted, noting that it would have a particularly 
negative effect on the training of advanced-practice nurses.  
</P>
<P>
 Advanced-practice nurses are the highly skilled medical practitioners who 
perform many medical procedures once left solely to physicians. Much of the 
push over ways to make health care more affordable has included calls for 
increased use of such nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the anticipated changes that will come about with health care reform, 
advanced-practice nurses will be needed now more than ever before," Takahashi 
said. "The plan does not take into consideration the health needs of not only 
the state but of the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA administrators did not speak at the hearing. But Vice Chancellor Claudia 
Mitchell-Kernan defended the cuts in comments shortly before the session began, 
noting that the university is scaling back many of its professional schools, 
and administrators believe there are other avenues, including the California 
State University system, through which to obtain undergraduate nursing 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "With tight budgets we really have to look to those things we do best and 
uniquely," Mitchell-Kernan said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 100 students enrolled in the undergraduate program, and about 
250 more in doctorate or master's degree programs. Counting elimination of 
undergraduate training and cuts in the graduate programs, the nursing school 
would lose about half its current enrollment if the budget plan goes through. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA nursing officials say the proposed budget cuts are so deep that they 
could threaten the existence of the two highly regarded Skid Row clinics, at 
the Union Rescue Mission and the St. Francis Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinics depend on the nursing school or administrative and staff support 
for such things as billing, grant applications and data collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Currie, president of the Union Rescue Mission, said the UCLA clinic 
offered "a critical service to a population with an acute need."

IN 3RD TRIAL, LAPD OFFICER IS CONVICTED OF STORE ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After three trials, a Los Angeles police officer was found guilty Thursday of 
masterminding the robbery of a check cashing store in the South Bay, but a jury 
deadlocked on counts involving a second robbery in the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury convicted Officer Bobby Rydell Marshall, 36, of three felonies -- 
grand theft, second-degree robbery and second-degree burglary -- in the 
September, 1989, robbery of an Anytime Check Cashing outlet in Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, who is suspended without pay and will probably be fired, could be 
sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. He had been free on bail, but Superior 
Court Judge Paul Gutman sent him to county jail on Thursday to await 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Two previous juries had deadlocked on all the charges against Marshall, one in 
favor of acquittal and the other in favor of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the jury deadlocked on charges involving the November, 1989, 
robbery of an Anytime Check Cashing outlet in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdict, jurors would not say whether the majority favored 
conviction or acquittal on the three felony counts stemming from the Torrance 
incident. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Efrem Grail said they told him they had 
deadlocked 7 to 5 on one count in favor of conviction and 11 to 1 on the other 
two in favor of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall's attorney, Edward A. Esqueda, said his client "feels confident that 
we will prevail on an appeal and he still emphatically denies any wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall has maintained since his 1992 arrest that the charges are punishment 
for his public criticism of the Los Angeles Police Department after the Rodney 
G. King beating case, for his 1991 statements to the Christopher Commission 
about racism and misconduct in the LAPD, and because he wrote a memoir of his 
11-year career titled "Inside the Blue Klux Klan." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the trials, Grail has dismissed Marshall's claims as an attempt to 
hide his wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 One juror, however, a woman who declined to give her name, said it seemed to 
her that Grail was conducting a witch hunt and that other prosecutors who had 
observed the trial were "out to get Marshall." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless she said, some evidence against him was compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other jurors cited evidence indicating that Marshall had used his 
patrol car computer on more than one occasion to get information on the victims 
before the robberies and had accepted more than 125 phone calls from a prison 
inmate who confessed to the robberies and is serving a 14-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 That witness, Gregory Sims, had been in prison two years when police 
interviewed him in June, 1991. Sims implicated Marshall and his wife, who at 
the time of the robberies was engaged to Bobby Marshall and worked at the 
Lawndale check cashing store. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Marshall was at one time charged with being an accomplice in the 
Lawndale robbery, but was acquitted of all charges last year during her 
husband's second trial.

EX-LAWYER GETS 12-YEAR PRISON TERM IN INSURANCE SCAM; FRAUD: LYNN STITES WAS 
THE MASTERMIND OF A RING OF ATTORNEYS THAT USED THE COURT SYSTEM TO BILK 
COMPANIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former fugitive attorney Lynn B. Stites was sentenced Thursday to more than 12 
years in prison for his role as mastermind of "the Alliance" insurance fraud 
and legal corruption scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Stites was convicted in October of racketeering and mail fraud charges 
stemming from his involvement with a secret network of Los Angeles area 
lawyers. Even with credit for 14 months in custody, Stites must serve at least 
10 years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines that limit time off for 
good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to imposing the prison term of 12 years and seven months, U.S. 
District Judge Clarence C. Newcomer confirmed a forfeiture verdict allowing the 
federal government to seize Stites' assets or future earnings of up to $50 
million -- the amount insurers supposedly lost because of his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring successful appeals by Stites and others convicted in the scheme, 
Thursday's sentencing may be the final act in a case that emerged as one of the 
largest criminal prosecutions of lawyers in U.S. history. Prosecutors described 
it as the largest fraud scheme ever that "involved the use of the United States 
legal system as a means to defraud insurance companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Stites, who formerly practiced law on the Westside and in Woodland Hills, was 
described as the scheme's organizer and main beneficiary. Prosecutors said that 
a ring of attorneys under his direction had bilked insurance companies of tens 
of millions of dollars in legal fees with complex litigations in Los Angeles, 
Orange and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen other lawyers previously received sentences ranging from probation and 
fines to 46 months in prison. Five law firm employees and clients also entered 
guilty pleas. The one remaining defendant -- Stites' former bookkeeper Roberto 
Rufino -- vanished with Stites when they were indicted in 1990 and has not been 
caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his capture in November, 1992, Stites spent more than 2 1/2 years in 
hiding under several assumed names -- frequenting the ski slopes of Colorado 
and renting a bay-view condominium in Miami Beach, where he also purchased a 
string of hurricane-damaged boats to refurbish and sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite extensive contacts with family members, he might have remained at 
large had he not raced through a speed trap in southern Illinois and then 
aroused the suspicion of a state trooper -- who spotted a pile of cash in 
Stites' sports car, obtained a search warrant and found Stites' real name among 
false identity papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing pale and gaunt Thursday in a green prison jumpsuit, Stites addressed 
the court for more than 10 minutes -- breaking a five-year public silence that 
had endured throughout the investigation and trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got too much involved in my own ego -- the money, the power," he told 
Newcomer before sentence was pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is any man who is truly broken . . . it's me," he said. "I've made a 
lot of mistakes, and I'm certain . . . I'll pay for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to steady his voice, Stites said he most regretted the damage he 
had done to friends and family, including his children. "They've seen their 
father vilified as a criminal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in pronouncing sentence, Newcomer invoked the harm to families of Stites' 
colleagues who were "drawn into the web which he created." 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomer did grant one of Stites' requests -- recommending that Stites be 
imprisoned "where his educational background and his skills might be utilized 
as fully as possible in an education program for other inmates." 
</P>
<P>
 Stites and his cohorts, who carried out the scheme between 1984 and 1988, 
became known as "the Alliance" after a client of one of the lawyers used the 
term in a conversation secretly taped by a government informant. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike traditional insurance scams involving staged traffic accidents or false 
medical claims, Stites and his associates were involved in genuine legal 
disputes. According to prosecutors, what made the scam ingenious was their use 
of standard legal procedures -- such as legal discovery and the filing of cross 
claims -- to prolong and expand cases for the sole purpose of reaping huge 
legal fees from insurers obliged to pay legal defense costs for policyholders.

WOMAN'S DEATH MAY BE LINKED TO OTHER KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The slaying of a woman whose body was discovered in an Ontario park is being 
investigated for links to three other killings in which the bodies of black 
women in their 30s were dumped in the East San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ontario victim, whose name was not released, was discovered fully clothed 
in San Antonio Park at 5 a.m. Wednesday, Ontario police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona police, who are investigating the other cases, said a preliminary 
investigation suggests that the slaying is probably unrelated to the other 
three. But investigators will wait for the San Bernardino County coroner's 
office to fix the cause of death before ruling out a link, Pomona Police Lt. 
Leon Sakamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other victims were Helen Hill, 36, of Covina; Donna Goldsmith, 35, of 
Montclair, and Cheryl Denise Sayers, 34, of Pomona.

EX-O.C. MAN, 2ND SKINHEAD SENT TO PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Thursday sentenced one member of the Fourth Reich Skinheads to 
nearly five years in prison and another to more than eight years, brusquely 
dismissing claims that they never meant to hurt anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were sending absolutely the wrong message," U.S. District Judge William 
Matthew Byrne Jr. said of Christopher David Fisher, 20, of Long Beach and Carl 
Daniel Boese, 17, formerly of Huntington Beach. "Hopefully, what occurs in this 
courtroom sends a different kind of message." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, who received the longer sentence, and Boese were leaders of a group of 
skinheads who used pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails on a number of residences 
and synagogues, including the Temple Beth David synagogue in Westminster. The 
group also plotted an attack on the historic First African Methodist Episcopal 
Church in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The skinheads hoped that their attacks would help spark a race war, but an FBI 
agent and informant had infiltrated the group. Agents arrested three members in 
July -- an event that captured national attention. The third suspect is 
awaiting trial in state court. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents of both young men were in the courtroom Thursday, and Fisher cried 
as he tried to explain his actions to the the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last six months, I've had a lot of time to soul-search and think about 
what I've done," he said, as his mother and father bowed their heads and his 
younger brother watched with rapt attention. "I don't think that I would have 
done that attack on the AME Church, but I can't deny the seriousness of what we 
said." 
</P>
<P>
 Boese displayed no emotion, insisting that he "never wanted to hurt anybody" 
and only sought to "do good." When Byrne announced his sentences, Boese 
shrugged and glanced over his shoulder at his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of Simon Wiesenthal Center, said the 
judge's sentences -- 57 months for Boese and 97 months for Fisher, followed by 
three years' supervised release for both -- would have the right effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious sentence and a very sobering one," said Cooper, who was 
one of the organizers of a series of counseling sessions that the skinheads 
attended last month. "Today's sentence is a message that society is going to 
take this kind of conduct seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher and Boese pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and as part of those 
pleas agreed to accept sentences slightly longer than those imposed by Byrne. 
The judge said federal sentencing guidelines forced him to give out shorter 
sentences than he might have imposed, but that he selected the longest sentence 
that he believed he could justify legally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sentence, of necessity, needs to be severe," Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Marc R. Greenberg, who prosecuted the case, said he was 
satisfied with the sentences. Lawyer Anna Ho, who represented Fisher, said an 
appeal of her client's sentence is under consideration. Corey House, Boese's 
attorney, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho and House had argued that short prison terms, combined with intensive 
counseling, would be enough to teach their clients a lesson without ruining 
their chances for rehabilitation. Boese and Fisher have undergone three days of 
innovative counseling organized by Greenberg and a number of prominent African 
American and Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that counseling, Fisher, Boese and other members of the Fourth 
Reich Skinheads met a federal judge, discussed their views with student 
counselors, met with two Holocaust survivors and, for the first time, sat down 
with the Rev. Cecil Murray, pastor of First AME Church and the target of one of 
their assassination plots. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting with Murray was especially emotional and ended with the minister, 
Boese and Fisher in tears. Murray forgave the youths and said later that he 
believed the meeting had a profound effect on all the participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg was the force behind the counseling program, and he received a 
letter this week from Fisher thanking him. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, who first addressed the letter to "Mark Greenbird," before scratching 
out the last name and spelling it correctly, wrote: "As far as I go, will 
probably never see you again because I'm staying out of trouble and trying very 
hard to get a job. . . . I'll just keep this short and just say, 'Thank you 
Mark Greenberg, I appreciate what you've done' and my deepest apologies for 
what I've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher also expressed his appreciation for the counseling sessions in a letter 
to Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
 "God has forgiven me. Cecil Murray has forgiven me," Fisher wrote. "I am 
working on forgiving myself. I can only pray that society can forgive me too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Thursday's hearing, Greenberg said he believes that Fisher has shown 
remorse and a genuine desire to change. But the prosecutor was less impressed 
by Boese's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's as bad, if not worse, than he was when he was arrested," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 House acknowledged that her client's racial views, which were captured on 
audio and videotape recorders during the undercover investigation, were 
"distasteful and heinous." She described Boese as very immature emotionally and 
said he had told a psychologist that he imagined that once he was in prison, he 
would have the chance to engage in philosophical discussions about race with 
other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 House called that a distorted fantasy of prison life. 
</P>
<P>
 Boese, who was born in Huntington Beach, grew up in Ontario but returned to 
Orange County a year ago and attended Marina High School, where he was enrolled 
in honors and advance-placement classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In March he was arrested on suspicion of etching a swastika in the school's 
lawn, raising a Nazi flag and burning material in the school. Shortly 
afterward, he left Huntington Beach and moved in with his father in Crestline. 
</P>
<P>
 He said during the trial that he met Fisher through a telephone number listed 
in the White Aryan Resistance newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 The two hit it off instantly, Boese told the judge in October, because they 
thought of themselves as staunchly conservative and hostile to blacks and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, the church-going son of academicians described as liberals, grew up in 
a home where racial tolerance was encouraged and practiced, according to those 
who know the Fisher family. 
</P>
<P>
 But during his first year in college, he organized first the White Youth 
Alliance and later the Fourth Reich Skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers for Fisher and Boese urged the judge to help them arrange for the 
defendants to serve their sentences in minimum-security prisons. The 
combination of their clients' ages, their notoriety and their association with 
racist views could otherwise subject Boese and Fisher to harm while in custody, 
the attorneys argued. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One doctor who examined Fisher warned that putting him into the general prison 
population could endanger his safety and chances for rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would promptly be taken over and thus protected by the white supremacists 
(perhaps with sexual subjugation as the price)," Louis Jolyon West wrote of 
Fisher. "The alternative might be his death by assassination." 
</P>
<P>
 Although judges cannot usually request a prison assignment for the defendants 
they sentence, Byrne agreed to meet with attorneys and to consider drafting a 
special request to the Bureau of Prisons. Greenberg said prosecutors had no 
objection to that arrangement, and Byrne scheduled a hearing for next week. 
</P>
<P>
 As Thursday's hearing concluded, Boese and his family quickly left the 
courtroom, declining comment as they hustled through the courthouse corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, who has been in custody since his arrest, was allowed to speak briefly 
with his father before he was escorted away by U.S. marshals. Fisher was 
shackled and handcuffed and led from the courtroom. His girlfriend, who has 
attended many of the hearings, waved a tearful farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love you," she said as he passed, flanked by marshals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love you too," Fisher responded.

BLACK UCI COACH STANDS UP FOR BOYCOTT; SPORTS: BAKER WILLING TO PAY PRICE TO 
JOIN PROTEST OF BASKETBALL SCHOLARSHIP CUT SEEN AS NCAA RACIAL BIAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking a stand for his beliefs is nothing new to Rod Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 As a student at College of the Holy Cross, he was among those occupying a 
building for two days during a 1972 protest of the school's minority hiring and 
scholarship policies. So the UC Irvine men's basketball coach has no qualms 
about boycotting games, whether it's only one or an entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of a boycott by the Black Coaches Assn. perhaps this weekend 
emerged Tuesday after the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rejected a 
proposal to increase the number of men's basketball scholarships allowed at 
each school. 
</P>
<P>
 While supporters of the existing limit saw the issue as primarily financial, 
the black coaches' group sees it as another step by the NCAA to limit the 
participation of black athletes and called it a slap in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be a Rhodes scholar to see who is hurt by this," said 
Baker. "If we (blacks) make up the majority of the pool of Division I players, 
then we're the ones who will be most hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Coaches Assn. has voted to stage a boycott, but the timing and 
nature of the protest is apparently still undecided. Many college 
administrators anticipate it will happen Saturday, anniversary of the birth of 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear which coaches and players will participate. Baker, who has been 
in almost hourly contact with members of the BCA executive committee, said a 
final decision on the timing and course of action has yet to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine is scheduled to play the University of Nevada, Reno, Saturday night in 
Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's basketball scholarship limit for Division I schools has been an 
issue for several years. It dropped from 15 per school in 1991-92 to 14 last 
season to 13 this season -- one part of a cost-containment package developed by 
the NCAA Presidents Commission. On Monday at the NCAA convention in San 
Antonio, representatives of the Division I schools rejected the proposal to 
increase the limit to 14 scholarships per school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are many, blacks included, who question why the BCA is making such an 
issue about a single scholarship. Cal State Fullerton President Milton Gordon 
and UCI Faculty Athletic Representative Dr. Lyman Porter voted to maintain the 
Division I scholarship level at 13 and Gordon, who is black, said it is not a 
racial issue, merely another cost-containment measure that is a sign of the 
economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baker, 41, a member of the BCA since its inception in August of 1987 when 
it was a loose collection of 30 coaches, says the vote is symbolic of something 
much more insidious than a minor fiscal decision. And to all those pragmatists, 
he has a most idealistic response. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of people 20, 30 years ago who put a lot on the line so I 
would be able to vote, be able to go to college, be able to have this job, be 
able to do so many things that my parents, and certainly my grandparents, 
weren't able to do," he said. "And there comes a time for each of us when there 
are things you have to do because, if you don't do them, you can't face 
yourself in the mirror in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you let something like this happen and know that you could have done 
something about it," he said, "how can you look at yourself in the mirror?" 
</P>
<P>
 Baker and other members of the BCA see the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
decision to continue limiting scholarships as a direct blow to minority rights, 
a slap in the face, and they're not about to turn the other cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's just the dollars and cents of it, well, is that one scholarship going 
to solve everything?" he asks. "Is everyone going to be in the black -- which 
is an ironic way of putting it, don't you think? -- because of that one 
scholarship? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I hear guys on the radio talk shows saying, 'Oh, well, who gets that 14th 
scholarship anyway?' But the quality of the athlete is not the point. It's a 
chance for a minority player to get an education, to get an opportunity. Can I 
tell you that our 14th guy would have been black? Of course not. But somebody 
else's 14th guy would have. And a whole bunch of those 14th guys would have. 
That's the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker wonders why the NCAA has ignored cost-cutting alternatives -- including 
limitations on off-campus scouting and a reduction in the recruiting calendar 
-- proposed by the National Assn. of Basketball Coaches, and why it has 
rejected a football playoff, which would net member institutions thousands of 
dollars apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that fiscally prudent?" he said. "Is it just money? I would hate to think 
it's something else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's resolve can't be shaken by opponents of the boycott who say current 
players will be the only ones really hurt by such an action. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're only in college for a certain amount of time, but does that mean you 
never make a stand?" he said. "You only live so long, so does that mean you 
never make a stand in your life? I just don't buy that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine coach says he will hold a meeting with his players today before the 
team flight to Reno to discuss the issues involved and allow them to make their 
own decision when and if the BCA calls for a nationwide boycott. The team could 
play the game with an assistant coach in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, I've only talked about it with a couple of guys who have come to me, 
but we'll have an open forum and it will be their decision," Baker said. "It 
will be my recommendation that it will be all or none, as far as the team is 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not drawing the line about me, though. I will make a decision for myself 
and they will make a decision as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also contend that the boycott will do more damage than good, 
exacerbating current fiscal woes by forfeiting television revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's all said and done," Baker said, "hitting people in the pocketbook 
is usually what makes them understand the quickest." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he hasn't even considered the ramifications to his wallet. Irvine 
Athletic Director Dan Guerrero said it would be premature to discuss 
contractual matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very minor consideration, anyway," Baker said. "In fact, it's not 
even an issue. There are certain things that supersede personal finances. And 
if I were to be fired from this job for doing what I feel I have to, then how 
important is this job?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Baker, who lives in Irvine with his wife, Deborah, son, Zachary, 5, and 
daughter, Rachel, 3, went home after an early morning practice Thursday to take 
his children to school and returned to his office with the reasons for his 
resolve more clear than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American dream, as best as I can tell, is that you work hard to make this 
country a better place for those who come after you," he said. "My parents 
worked very hard so I could have more opportunities than they had. And it's my 
responsibility to make sure my kids have a better opportunity to make the most 
of their lives than I had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, because I'm a Division I basketball coach, I have the forum to do 
something and I can't pretend that's not the case. People say it's just one 
scholarship. Well, 12 years from now, Zachary's only going to need one 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if someone says, 'Oh, Rod Baker's only worried about his own kids,' 
that's . . . right, that's exactly what I'm thinking about." Profile: Rod Baker

JAIL SEGREGATION MAY BE NECESSARY, ACLU OFFICE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a history of staunch opposition to racial segregation, American Civil 
Liberties Union leaders said Thursday that keeping blacks and Latinos apart in 
Los Angeles County jails may be the only way to defuse the explosive tensions 
that have erupted into riots in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the compelling state interest of keeping prisoners free of harm, 
we believe it might be constitutionally permissible. We now feel that," said 
Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California. Local 
ACLU Legal Director Paul Hoffman agreed and said the ACLU is examining the 
constitutional ramifications of such a policy at the request of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Although top sheriff's officials said they are not yet seriously considering 
long-term segregation, they acknowledged asking Ripston, Hoffman and other ACLU 
officials to discuss the feasibility of enacting such a policy during a meeting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That meeting was arranged in response to the largest riot ever at the mammoth 
Peter J. Pitchess jail in Castaic, which occurred last Sunday. As many as 1,000 
inmates rioted for hours, swinging homemade knives and broken broomsticks at 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty inmates were injured in the melee, including 24 who were taken to 
hospitals, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, a series of fights have broken out at court lockups throughout the 
county and at Pitchess, especially when sheriff's deputies tried to 
re-integrate blacks and Latinos against their will. The two races have been 
kept mostly separate, and both warring sides have warned that more rioting will 
occur if they are put back together. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, two African American inmates broke free of their handcuffs and 
injured six Latino and white inmates who were still shackled as a bus carried 
55 prisoners to San Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of keeping the Castaic facility segregated has weighed heavily 
on the minds of sheriff's officials. They say they don't want to resort to such 
a drastic measure, but they would otherwise be in the untenable position of 
trying to force inmates to get along when they don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Robert J. Spierer, who commands the facility, confirmed that the 
department did ask the ACLU to discuss the issue. But he said the department 
still believes that segregating the inmates would be bad policy and possibly 
unconstitutional. It would also be a procedural nightmare, he said, because of 
the sheer number of inmates -- about 21,000 countywide -- and the fact that so 
many of them need to be transported to and from the Pitchess facility to 
courthouses around the county every day. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Spierer said, the department has resisted calls for segregation 
for years, even though fights and racially motivated riots have been 
commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would basically amount to us almost throwing in the towel, and we prefer 
not to do that," Spierer said. "However, if that is the only way we can protect 
the inmates, than we will have to consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not considering it seriously right now," he added. "We were just 
looking at options." 
</P>
<P>
 Spierer said jail officials are still trying to slowly re-integrate inmates in 
the North County Correctional Facility at Pitchess -- the site of Sunday's riot 
-- by moving troublemakers to other jail wings and buildings and moving in new 
inmates. He said the department considers permanent segregation potentially 
dangerous because it would allow blacks and Latinos to devise plans to attack 
each other when reunited in non-segregated holding tanks and buses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd still have problems when we put them together," he said. "It is a 
near-impossibility to segregate (completely), and we would increase the 
likelihood of violence when they are in shared facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Spierer cited Thursday morning's bus incident as proof. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred about 7 a.m. as the bus approached the courthouse, 
traveling southbound on the Golden State Freeway. A sheriff's spokeswoman said 
two of the nine black inmates who were sitting in the back of the bus slipped 
off their handcuffs. One man began stabbing white and Latino inmates with a 
6-inch sharpened nail, she said, while the other beat them with his fists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of the inmates was seriously hurt, but three were treated at local 
hospitals for puncture wounds and lacerations and later released, said 
Sheriff's Deputy Irma Becerra. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ACLU has long opposed nearly all types of segregation, Ripston 
and Hoffman said it was the seriousness of the riot -- and the chronic nature 
of the racial conflict -- that led the powerful civil rights organization to 
re-examine its position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the background on which we based past decisions comes out of the 
South, where black prisoners were kept from white ones, which is wrong. It is 
unconstitutional," Ripston said. "But this issue is different. This one 
involves the safety of inmates." 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU has no authority to direct Sheriff's Department decisions or policy. 
But sheriff's officials are influenced by the group's stands because of its 
successful lawsuits filed to protect the rights and safety of jail inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, the ACLU won a court order forcing the Sheriff's Department 
to modify certain procedures, including addressing the problem of overcrowding. 
The ACLU was given authority under that judgment to monitor conditions at 
county jails and continues to inspect them and counsel sheriff's officials on 
such issues as overcrowding and racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Segregation probably would not be needed throughout the jail system, although 
Ripston said the group is considering supporting such a policy at county jails 
other than Pitchess, including the downtown Los Angeles jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Spierer, the Pitchess commander, said department officials did not expect the 
ACLU, given its historic anti-segregation stance, to be so supportive of 
keeping blacks and Latinos apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a bit surprised that they were as open to it and more willing to 
consider it as a possibility than we were," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripston said any formal policy on jail segregation would have to be considered 
by the ACLU's 24-member executive committee and that she plans to test the 
waters with members of the panel in the near future.

WAR EXPANDS ON LARGEST SOUTHLAND MEDFLY INFESTATION; AGRICULTURE: MALATHION 
WILL BE SPRAYED OVER CORONA. THREE-COUNTY QUARANTINE WIDENED TO 1,461 SQUARE 
MILES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agriculture officials on Thursday announced a massive eradication effort and a 
1,461-square-mile quarantine area across three counties to battle the largest 
infestation of the crop-ravaging Mediterranean fruit fly in Southern 
California's history. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they said aerial spraying of malathion -- which generated a 
widespread public outcry four years ago -- will begin Jan. 24 over Corona, 
where a mated female Medfly was discovered in December. The discovery of a 
Medfly in Riverside County -- outside the already targeted eradication zone -- 
could presage its spread to rich agricultural lands, state and county officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new offensive overshadows the efforts to eradicate the Medfly in 1989-90, 
when widespread aerial spraying of malathion was believed to have eliminated 
the pest from the region. 
</P>
<P>
 This outbreak once again threatens to devastate the $18-billion California 
agriculture industry. Officials in Japan -- which annually buys about $300 
million worth of California citrus and other fruit susceptible to the Medfly -- 
are threatening an embargo on that fruit, citing fear of a Medfly infestation 
there, said Henry Voss, secretary of the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture. A statewide infestation of the Medfly could cost the state economy 
$900 million annually, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being pushed by our trading partners to put a lid on this problem 
before they have to put a quarantine on us," Voss said at a news conference in 
Corona. The spread of the Medfly "has developed to a point where it is a threat 
to the economic well-being of the state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To battle the Medfly in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties, more 
than 400 million sterile Medflies will be released weekly for two years 
beginning in March. The strategy relies on female Medflies mating with sterile 
flies, creating sterile offspring that will ultimately doom the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said there were no plans to renew aerial spraying of malathion in 
the three-county quarantine zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said there were no plans to renew aerial spraying of malathion in 
Orange, Los Angeles or San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, sterile flies will be released not only in areas already 
affected, such as Westminster, Garden Grove, Fountain Valley, Tustin, Santa 
Ana, Anaheim and Orange, but in most other areas north and east of the county, 
all of which are now included in the quarantine area, according to Thursday's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Because laboratories in Hawaii cannot radioactively sterilize enough Medflies 
to blanket Corona all at once, aerial spraying will be done over that city, 
Voss said. The insecticide dose will be half the strength of that used in the 
1989-90 sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona officials complained that they were given no notice of the spraying 
before Thursday's public announcement, although Riverside County supervisors 
were given advance notice as a courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona City Councilman Jeffrey Bennett said the area targeted for aerial 
spraying has a population of about 90,000, and said it was clear to him that 
state officials chose his community, rather than Los Angeles, for aerial 
spraying because Corona lacks the power of larger cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles has more political clout, and I resent that," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of the news conference, Bennett said angrily: "Your project 
has failed to date (to eradicate the Medfly). This happens every year. What the 
hell is going on?" 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1990, agricultural officials said they hoped Southern California was 
rid of the Medfly, after they had quarantined a 1,300-square-mile area, done 
widespread aerial spraying of malathion and flooded the region with sterile 
Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1991, a pregnant Medfly was discovered in a peach tree near the 
Koreatown section of Los Angeles, and through 1992 more than 200 other Medflies 
were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 At most recent count, officials said Thursday, more than 400 Medflies have 
been discovered in the region. Among the more troublesome finds was the mated 
female Medfly in a Corona grapefruit tree two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 J. R. Reynolds, a regional director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
blamed the increase in Medflies on both the transporting of fly-infected fruit 
outside quarantine areas and continued illegal importation of infected fruit 
from Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the banned Asian fruit arrives here by way of British Columbia, which 
does not have a Medfly quarantine because of its cold winter climate, Reynolds 
said. Some of the fruit is unwittingly taken to California by travelers, and 
other fruit is smuggled here for sale at grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large percentage of stores are selling fruit that is illegal in the United 
States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss characterized the current Medfly campaign as "proactive" in stopping the 
insect's spread across the state. A statewide infestation, he said, would cost 
the state $900 million a year in lost trade, related jobs and the increased 
costs for pesticides by growers and backyard gardeners wanting to keep their 
plants free of Medfly maggots. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss said he was braced for opposition to the aerial spraying. "I'm sure 
people won't be jumping up and down and be happy over this," he said. Three 
helicopters will dispense the malathion while flying about 500 above the 
ground. The helicopters will be "very intrusive," he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the larger Los Angeles basin quarantine area already is stocked 
with sterile Medflies, he said, it would be counterproductive to spray 
malathion there. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona will be blanketed by a mist composed of 10% malathion and 90% corn 
syrup-based bait. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of malathion has been challenged because of its unknown long-term 
effects and questions of whether, at high doses, it is carcinogenic. But the 
California Department of Health Services said that a health risk assessment 
after the 1989-90 sprayings showed no significant health effects on those 
exposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some individuals experienced mild, short-term skin irritation but "it was 
concluded that it is very unlikely malathion causes major chronic health 
effects such as cancer and birth defects," according to a consensus statement 
issued by the state and the Malathion Public Health Effects Advisory Committee. 
"Concerns about eye disease were found to be unwarranted, and pesticide 
poisoning and other serious effects did not occur." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement acknowledged that the anger and anxiety created by aerial 
spraying of malathion, a common garden insecticide, is "an important public 
health consideration" in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss said malathion will be sprayed over Corona eight to 10 times, starting 
Jan. 24 and ending in late June. Each application will take three to four 
hours, he said. The effort will cost between $750,000 and $1 million, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the completion of the sprayings, if no Medflies are found, the existing 
2,400-acre quarantine area around Corona will be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 A multiagency task force will host a public meeting on aerial spraying at 6 
p.m. Tuesday at the county library in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of sterile Medflies in the Los Angeles Basin quarantine area will 
continue weekly through December, 1995, and will cost about $70 million. If 
deemed successful, the quarantine would be lifted in early 1996, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The female Medfly attacks ripening or ripe fruit. The insects lay eggs in the 
fruit and the larvae feed on the fruit pulp, rotting it. The emerging flies can 
live up to four weeks in the summer, or up to three months in the winter.

WOMAN GETS OK TO SUE O.C. HOTEL IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Massachusetts woman who slipped and fell in a bathtub in an Anaheim hotel 
room can sue the hotel owner in Massachusetts, the state Supreme Judicial Court 
ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was hailed by the woman's lawyer, who said it would make it easier 
for Massachusetts residents to sue out-of-state corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sweeping victory for Massachusetts plaintiffs," said Wendy 
Sibbison, the attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiff, Claire Tatro, attended a conference in 1988 at the Quality 
Hotel and Conference Center in Anaheim. Tatro said that during her stay, she 
slipped in the bathtub, hurting her back. The injury required surgery, 
resulting in medical bills totaling $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Tatro filed suit against the hotel's parent firm, Manor Care Inc., in 
Hampden County Superior Court. But a judge sided with Manor Care's motion to 
dismiss the suit, arguing that the Massachusetts court had no jurisdiction over 
the company in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 But the high court disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 In its unanimous opinion, the court said the hotel conducted business in 
Massachusetts by seeking customers from this state and by entering a 
reservation contract with Tatro. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the court said the woman's complaint arose from the hotel's 
transaction of business in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 If the defendant had not been soliciting business in Massachusetts and had not 
agreed to provide Tatro with accommodations, "the plaintiff would not have been 
injured in a room of the hotel," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sibbison said plaintiffs need the ability to file such lawsuits in their home 
states because it can be difficult and expensive for them to travel across the 
country to pursue their claims. Also, she said the plaintiffs' Massachusetts 
lawyers might not be familiar enough with the laws in other states, putting 
them at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 By forcing the plaintiff to file suit outside Massachusetts, "the defendant 
holds the cards," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court echoed this sentiment, saying the hotel has the resources to 
defend itself in Massachusetts.

BOYCOTT IS NEAR 'NUCLEAR'; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BCA'S WASHINGTON TRYING TO GET 
ARBITRATION FROM CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drake University basketball Coach Rudy Washington, executive director of the 
Black Coaches Assn., said he will meet today in Washington with members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus in hopes of getting an arbitrator to mediate the 
ongoing dispute between his group and NCAA leaders over scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters after his team's game at Tulsa on Thursday night, 
Washington said the BCA will move ahead with plans to stage a series of 
boycotts, beginning with Saturday's games, if the matter cannot be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's right on the verge of being nuclear," he said. "If we can't come to some 
kind of terms, I'm really afraid of the season itself (being lost). . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We're reasonable men, and I think the NCAA is reasonable. But, again, we were 
made promises that weren't kept." 
</P>
<P>
 BCA leaders said Tuesday the group will stage the walkouts to show displeasure 
with NCAA convention delegates' rejection of a proposal that would have 
restored the scholarship limit in Division I men's basketball to 14. NCAA 
cost-containment initiatives have reduced the number of scholarships from 15 in 
1991 to 14 last year and to 13 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The BCA believes the delegates' failure to approve the scholarship proposal 
will serve to further limit blacks' access to higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington and other BCA leaders have refused to provide details of the 
planned disruptions except to say that players will be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ft. Worth Star-Telegram, quoting an unidentified source with knowledge of 
the BCA's intentions, reported Thursday that the group has targeted nine games 
-- including USC's matchup with Washington State at Pullman -- scheduled for 
Saturday, the birthday of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King. In each 
of the targeted games, minorities coach both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some games will be delayed, some won't be played, at some games the teams 
will leave at halftime," the newspaper quoted its source as saying. "There will 
be a variety of things that will occur throughout the season. There won't be 
any games where just one team is involved, so there won't be any forfeits." 
</P>
<P>
 There were signs Thursday, however, that the BCA was preparing to engage in a 
milder form of protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press, quoting an unidentified source, reported that several 
high-profile black coaches, including USC's George Raveling, would walk off the 
court just before their teams' games Saturday and that players would not be 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "My take on it, from people around the country, is this (boycott) may not come 
off at all," said Mike Gilleran, West Coast Conference commissioner. "The 
reaction nationally apparently hasn't been what the coaches would have wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Another college athletic official, who asked not to be identified, said: 
"There's a feeling (the boycott) isn't going to be as widespread as reported." 
</P>
<P>
 One factor that could be forcing the BCA's hand is the lack of a statement of 
support from the National Assn. of Basketball Coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in conference most of (Wednesday) night and (Thursday)," Duke 
Coach Mike Krzyzewski, a member of the NABC board, said after his team's game 
with Wake Forest Thursday night in Durham, N.C. "No decision has been made." 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor is pressure from college chief executive officers, some of whom 
reportedly have threatened to take a hard line against coaches who pull their 
players off the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Fort, North Carolina A&T chancellor, told the Greensboro (N.C.) News 
and Record that, while he is sympathetic toward the BCA, his school's coaches 
and players will not participate in a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with the Nashville Tennessean, Tennessee State Coach Frankie 
Allen, a BCA member, said he would not participate in a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be easy for me to go along with boycotts, but I have a commitment to 
this university and the 14 players I coach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, commissioners from the 33 NCAA Division I conferences, meeting via 
conference call Thursday, discussed a variety of scenarios, including the 
prospect of games that would be canceled because both teams refused to play. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA playing rules stipulate that, in such a case, the referee declares "no 
game" and refers the matter to the conference involved for appropriate action. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, the consensus among the commissioners was that 
conferences should tag both teams in such instances with forfeit losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "That seems logical to me," Gilleran said. "If both teams don't show, it 
should be a double forfeit. I don't know another way to do it. Rescheduling is 
not an option." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic directors, athletic faculty representatives and senior administrators 
for women's sports from Pacific 10 Conference schools will participate in a 
conference call today to discuss the situation. Following that meeting, Pac-10 
CEOs will also meet via conference call. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Hansen, Pac-10 commissioner, declined comment when asked what course of 
action he will recommend to the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Corrigan, Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner and president of the 
College Commissioners Assn., said: "We're all hopeful that we don't need these 
procedures. There are other forces at work out there."

BRUINS BOUNCE BACK FROM TERRIBLE START; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: WASHINGTON STATE 
JUMPS TO 23-6 ADVANTAGE, THEN FALLS AT THE FINISH, 81-79. UCLA IMPROVES TO 
10-0.

 What might happen in UCLA's game Saturday at Washington? 
</P>
<P>
 A boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened in the Bruins' game Thursday night against Washington State? 
</P>
<P>
 They got caught . . . well, almost. 
</P>
<P>
 The unbeaten Bruins, who trailed by 17 points in the first six minutes, won 
their 10th consecutive game by downing Washington State, 81-79, at Freil Court. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it wasn't especially pretty, but it was clearly effective. The No. 
5-ranked Bruins didn't relegate the Cougars to an 0-3 Pacific 10 Conference 
start until the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 With UCLA clinging to a 77-76 lead, Charles O'Bannon blocked Eddie Hill's 
shot. Tyus Edney got the ball and was fouled intentionally by Tony Harris, 
which resulted in a technical foul and two free throws by Edney as well as 
possession of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney made them both, George Zidek made two more and that was enough for UCLA 
to withstand Hill's three-pointer with 1.3 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon led UCLA, 3-0 in the Pac-10, with 18 points and nine rebounds. All 
five Bruin starters scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Down by 10 points at the half, UCLA caught up at 51-51 on two free throws by 
Rodney Zimmerman, fell behind and caught up again at 58-58. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until Edney's driving layup with 4:08 left that UCLA got its first 
lead, 72-71. 
</P>
<P>
 But even after Cougar standout Mark Hendrickson, a 6-9 forward, fouled out 
with 3:36 to go, UCLA couldn't pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they squeaked away, but left the court with their arms raised in 
triumph. They didn't leave it that way at the end of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you could say Palouse, the Cougars had run off to a 23-6 lead and the 
Bruins seemed to be in a state of shock. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, except for a couple of one-handed rebound dunks by Ed O'Bannon 
and Charles O'Bannon, the only glimmers of emotion produced on UCLA's end of 
the court were the sideways glance Zimmerman shot at Harrick and Harrick 
pushing away assistant coach Mark Gottfried when Harrick was arguing a call. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say it wasn't exactly UCLA's finest moment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins missed eight free throws, had eight turnovers, missed 21 of 33 
shots and finished the first half extremely fortunate to be trailing by only 
45-35. 
</P>
<P>
 As for UCLA's vaunted running game, it produced exactly two points in the 
first half, those coming on a steal by Edney and his assist on Ed O'Bannon's 
dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 That brought the Bruins to within 34-25, which is as close as they got in the 
half except for the first couple of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Harrick expects Saturday's game at Seattle to proceed without 
incident, despite indications that the Black Coaches Assn. will stage some sort 
of action to protest the NCAA decision on scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick said no one from the BCA has contacted him about a possible action and 
neither has he spoken with UCLA Chancellor Charles Young or Athletic Director 
Pete Dalis to receive any instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is what I read in the papers," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Harrick said he is "genuinely sympathetic" to the BCA stance on the 
scholarship issue, he also said, "Not everything in life is fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick indicated that the National Assn. of Basketball Coaches might be a 
better forum to work on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our NABC had fought and lobbied and worked very, very hard to get 
one more scholarship rule passed. And it didn't. It's upsetting, but you've got 
to go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NABC wants to go by what the NCAA says. They are the governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 'I'll do what the NCAA says." 
</P>

TROJANS HOLD ON FOR 53-46 VICTORY; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: DESPITE RAVELING'S 
RECENT INVOLVEMENT WITH BLACK COACHES ASSN., THEY 'KEEP FOCUS' AND SURVIVE 
WASHINGTON RALLY. 
</P>

<P>
 For 22 minutes Thursday night at Hec Edmundson Pavilion, USC played some of 
its best basketball of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Trojans built a 16-point second-half lead over Washington, the 
Huskies came back to trail by only three before Tremayne Anchrum's put-back of 
an offensive rebound with 3:14 to play ended the rally to secure a 53-46 USC 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans improved to 10-2 overall, 3-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference. The 
Huskies fell to 2-10 and 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach George Raveling thought that under the circumstances the Trojans did 
quite well. Raveling, involved in the Black Coaches Assn. protest and planned 
boycott, spent most of theweek on the telephone and being interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proud of the way these kids were able to keep their focus," Raveling 
said. "I'm happy it turned out this way. I think the kids wanted to protect the 
old man." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling would not commit on whether the scheduled game with Washington State 
will be played Saturday at Pullman, Wash. But he will hold a news conference 
today at noon at the team hotel in Moscow, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies made three three-pointers early in the game, but their shooting, 
except for that of junior forward Scott Didrickson, was atrocious as the Bruins 
opened a 36-22 halftime lead. Didrickson was four of five in the half, the rest 
of the team two of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, the Trojans, after making two baskets in the first two 
minutes, went six minutes without scoring and made only five more points in the 
next 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 They wound up with only 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans might have had an easier time if they could have done well from 
the free-throw line. They thought the problem was solved last Saturday when 
they shot 81% from the line against Oregon. Against the Huskies, they were six 
of 19. Lorenzo Orr, who had eight points to trail Brandon Martin for scoring 
honors by a point, missed all four attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Didrickson, with all his points coming in the first half, led all scorers with 
11, the only player in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, with Jamie Booker giving the team momentum, ran off a 9-2 streak 
late in the game that closed the gap to 47-44 before Anchrum put back a Burt 
Harris miss to make it 49-44, and Washington didn't score again until they made 
two free throws with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling was lavish in his praise of new Washington Coach Bob Bender, only 36 
and coaching a team missing all of last year's top players. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is getting as much out of his talent as anybody possibly could," Raveling 
said. "They don't win very often, but they are a tough team to beat. They give 
everyone a battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, who shot 39.7% from the field, shot 31.6% from the free-throw 
line. The Huskies shot 27.3% and 60%.

MIKE DOWNEY: CAN YOU MAKE UP STUFF THIS BIZARRE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suppose a paperback writer approached a publisher with a preposterous plot. 
The subject is skating. The scene is the Winter Olympics. A winsome young woman 
from New England is assailed by a crazed stranger before a performance. Unable 
to skate, she must sit helplessly as her nemesis, a saucy spitfire from the 
Pacific Northwest, spins, wins and grins. 
</P>
<P>
 But when police investigate, the winner's ex-husband and bodyguard are accused 
of a conspiracy to hire the crazed stranger. And one report, probably 
erroneous, even had the skater herself suspected of complicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot sickens. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe the publisher pushes the author out of the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe, just maybe, the publisher gets the agents of Julia Roberts and 
Sharon Stone on the phone and begins haggling over the movie rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Is truth truly stranger than fiction? Let me tell you about a worst-selling 
novel of 10 years ago, "Death Spiral," written by one Meredith Phillips and 
published by Perseverance Books of Menlo Park, Calif., which happened to 
coincide with an actual Winter Olympics that was held that year during happier 
days in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. Let me tell you the story in a nutshell and then 
you tell me which, truth or fiction, is the nuttier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cold war on ice," reads the back cover, "as love and defection breed 
murder at the Winter Olympics. Who killed world champion skater Dima Kuznetsov, 
the 'playboy of the eastern world' -- old or new lovers? Hockey right-wingers? 
Jealous rivals? The KGB? Will skating sleuth Lesley Grey discover the murderer 
before she herself is hunted down?"  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, that unlucky Lesley Grey. It was a dark and stormy night. And this was one 
tricky assignment, even for the most hard-boiled of skating sleuths. Yet the 
most bizarre twist to me is a blurb on the paperback that invites readers to 
come along for a merry spin on this rink of danger and intrigue, the one that 
reads: "Meredith Phillips understands the competitive skating world, and writes 
an intense and gripping story about it. If you like skating, you'll love 'Death 
Spiral.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Who is this quote from? 
</P>
<P>
 It is from Richard Dalley, a former figure skater who was among the 
competitors in those 1984 Olympic Games, where he and his partner, Carol Fox, 
placed fifth in ice dancing. Dalley already was a mature 26 when he and his 
skatemate, who was nearly a year older, returned home to their birthplace of 
Detroit from their world travels. Their story was neither intense nor gripping. 
All of their spirals had been pleasant ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, Richard Dalley was the event director of last week's U.S. 
Figure Skating Championships right there in Detroit, the rotor city. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about one for the books. 
</P>
<P>
 From now on, should anyone author a mystery about figure skaters and request a 
blurb from Richard, chances are it will be unprintable. The poor guy had done a 
splendid job preparing everything for the arrival of the most skillful skaters 
in the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a snowstorm hit. Then the blizzard knocked out heat and electricity in a 
headquarters hotel. Then one of the defending dance champions, Renee Roca, 
collided with another skater at practice and broke her left wrist. Then popular 
pairs skaters Natasha Kuchiki and Rocky Marval were denied a trip to the 
Olympics by the peculiar judgment of the judges. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which paled next to the biggest story on ice, the unfathomable ambush 
of Nancy Kerrigan by some cretin with a crowbar. Followed by a citywide police 
dragnet. Followed by the triumphant performance of Tonya Harding, the 
hard-talking, hot-rodding, pool-playing asthmatic (and fiction writer's dream) 
whose sentiment toward Kerrigan was principally the desire to "whip her butt," 
a skater who speaks not the demure language of an ice princess but the 
snap-crackle-pop talk of a hockey player. 
</P>
<P>
 All the elements are there, including winter's. Great comedy. Great tragedy. 
In one corner you have Kerrigan, the welder's daughter whose mother is legally 
blind. In another corner stands Harding, who overcame coughing fits to qualify 
for the Olympics and then say: "I made it! I'm the Tonya Harding that everyone 
always believes in." And betwixt and between stand some highly unusual 
suspects, who could be falsely accused or could, depending on the outcome, turn 
Tonya's victory from a possible Olympic one into an astoundingly Pyrrhic one. 
</P>
<P>
 Who, in fact or fiction, could have foreseen such a thing? 
</P>
<P>
 Disfigure skating. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the most amazing story of this or any other year, this story of 
a possible conspiracy to keep a skater from skating, this story of a run-by 
kneecapping, this story that will make me refrain from ever again calling any 
other story implausible. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw a "Twilight Zone" once. It was about a boxer. Lee Marvin was his 
manager. The boxer was a robot. He had to box a better robot. But when Lee 
Marvin's robot broke, Lee Marvin had to pretend he was a robot, climb into the 
ring and box the better robot. 
</P>
<P>
 I now believe this actually happened.

THEY MAY HAVE STRUGGLED AT TIMES, BUT IT SEEMS THE BUFFALO BILLS ARE BACK ON 
THEIR GAME AND ONCE AGAIN . . .; RUNNING ON SUPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Before we go any further, the Buffalo Bills would like to get a few things 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Buffalo media: We are not the bickering Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Raiders: We are not cocky. 
</P>
<P>
 To those across the country who do not want to see the Bills in yet another 
Super Bowl: We are not planning on staying home. 
</P>
<P>
 If it sounds as if there's a large chip on the collective shoulders of the 
Bills, that's understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Buffalo finished the regular season with a 12-4 record and home-field 
advantage throughout the AFC playoffs, it has been a rough year for the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's new? 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid '80s, Buffalo was a bad team. Over a period of four seasons, 
beginning in 1984, the Bills won a total of 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, they got respectable. Then, they got good. Then, they got great. 
</P>
<P>
 But they couldn't shake the losing image. 
</P>
<P>
 For each of the last three seasons, Buffalo has made it to the Super Bowl. And 
each time, the Bills have lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that they finished ahead of 26 other teams. Never mind that the 
Miami Dolphins are the only other team in NFL history to have made it to the 
Super Bowl three times in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo couldn't win the big one. And it hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how much the Bills talk about winning them one at a time, the Super 
Bowl is always in the back of their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo defensive end Bruce Smith was asked about it after practice at Rich 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium on Thursday. Surrounded by reporters from around the country, Smith 
was in a good mood, talking easily about everything from his new potato-chip 
commercial to the predicted bad weather for Saturday's AFC playoff game against 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Smith was asked about the importance of finally winning a Super Bowl, 
he got very serious in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It needs to be done with a great deal of urgency," he said. "We've been at 
bat three times, and we've struck out each time." 
</P>
<P>
 If you have to lose three consecutive times in the national spotlight, it at 
least helps to have as your coach a thoughtful, philosophical leader who has a 
real talent for putting the ups and downs of sports into perspective. The Bills 
have such a man in Marv Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You agonize about it, but not for as long as people think," Levy said of the 
Super Bowl losses. "It hurts like hell for three days, maybe for a week, maybe 
for 10 days. Then, you forget about it and go back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to our team at the beginning of this season and I said, 'You know 
something? Winning the Super Bowl is not our goal. Our goal is to win next 
Sunday. And if you keep winning next Sunday and next Sunday and next Sunday, 
winning the Super Bowl will be the result." 
</P>
<P>
 But it proved harder for Buffalo to win each Sunday in 1993 than in seasons 
past. The club's once highly potent offense was impotent at times. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the team that intimidated opponents with the no-huddle offense, with 
long bombs by quarterback Jim Kelly, with the speed and hands of receivers 
Andre Reed and James Lofton, and with the legs of Thurman Thomas and Kenneth 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the last four seasons, the Bills led the AFC in points scored, 
leading the entire league in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But not this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo finished fourth in the AFC and seventh in the NFL with 329 points, 52 
fewer than a year ago and 129 fewer than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened? 
</P>
<P>
 Several things. With Bill Brooks replacing Lofton, who became a free agent 
after last season, the Bills have not had as many long plays downfield. Thomas 
has not been as involved in the passing game. Changes in the offensive line 
caused disruptions at times. 
</P>
<P>
 It all came to a head for Buffalo when the Raiders were here in early 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed had just been fined for criticizing the coaches. Thomas was also 
criticizing the offense. Kelly was criticizing teammates for not putting a full 
effort into every play. 
</P>
<P>
 It brought back memories of earlier stormy times in Buffalo, when the team was 
known as the bickering Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Raider game, the Bills' third loss in four games, Thomas exploded at 
the Buffalo media. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no damn controversy around the Buffalo Bills," he said. "We're a 
good team and if you don't like it, you don't have to write about it. There's 
no bickering Bills going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Bills are no longer bickering. Of course, winning their last four 
games -- and scoring 47 points against the Dolphins -- relieved a lot of 
worries. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also after the Raider game that defensive tackle Nolan Harrison accused 
the Bills, specifically Thomas, of being cocky and arrogant. Thomas swaggered 
into the end zone on an easy touchdown run that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any cockiness about anything that we do," Buffalo 
linebacker Darryl Talley said. "We play aggressive football and we get excited. 
Now if somebody misconstrues that as being cocky, I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bills played their final regular-season game at Indianapolis, someone 
hung a banner in the Hoosier Dome that read, "Like it or not, they're 
baaaaack." 
</P>
<P>
 That they are. Despite the struggles and the controversy, Buffalo managed to 
win the AFC East title and finish with one more victory than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bickering, battling, boastful. . . . Say what you want about them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills have heard it all. But they keep coming back, still hoping to 
someday hear three very different words: Super Bowl champions.

 It is hardly the elixir to all of their bullpen woes, but the Angels acquired 
what they believe will be invaluable experience Thursday when they signed 
left-hander Craig Lefferts to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts was guaranteed $400,000 in 1994 and can earn $900,000 in incentives 
if he appears in 68 games or pitches 90 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts, 36, the Texas Rangers' opening-day starter last season, becomes the 
Angels' first free-agent signee of the winter. He will be used primarily as a 
middle reliever and setup man, but also can be a spot starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're realistic about everything," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said, 
"but we think he can help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts, who made eight starts and 44 relief appearances last season for 
Texas, was 3-9 with a 6.05 ERA.  
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts fills the void left by Steve Frey, who signed with the San Francisco 
Giants. BOB NIGHTENGALE

NHL ROUNDUP; RECCHI SPURS FLYERS PAST BRUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Recchi had two goals and an assist to lead the Philadelphia Flyers to a 
6-2 victory over the Boston Bruins on Thursday night at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flyers, who have won two in a row for the first time since Nov. 26, are 
13-2-2 against Northeast Division opponents. Boston, which entered the game as 
the NHL's best road team, dropped its third straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia's offense finally came to life after managing only 30 goals in 
its last 15 games. The Flyers scored more than four goals for the first time 
since Dec. 2. They are 18-4-2 when scoring four or more goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 1, Tampa Bay 0 -- Jeremy Roenick scored a power-play goal in the first 
period and Ed Belfour made it stand up at Chicago for his 19th shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Belfour made 20 saves -- including three on breakaways late in the second 
period -- to earn his first shutout since Dec. 19 and third of the season. 
Chicago's victory ended a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing goaltender Daren Puppa was nearly as good as Belfour, making 28 of 29 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Roenick was set up when defenseman Steve Smith jarred the puck away from Joe 
Reekie, who was attempting to clear during Chicago's power play. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Murphy pounced on the loose puck and passed it to Roenick. Roenick sent 
the puck under the pads of Puppa at 16:03 for only his fourth goal in the last 
21 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 4, Dallas 3 -- Glenn Anderson's goal with 13.8 seconds left in 
overtime gave the Maple Leafs the victory at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who was coming out of the penalty box, took Doug Gilmour's pass and 
fought off Derian Hatcher's check to fire a shot past Darcy Wakaluk. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 6, Edmonton 4 -- Jeff Brown scored the Blues' third power-play goal 
of the night midway through the third period for the game-winner at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan Shanahan had a goal and three assists and Craig Janney had a goal and 
two assists for the Blues, who are 9-1-2 in their last 12 games against the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis was three for five on the power play as Janney and Brett Hull also 
scored with the man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 2, Pittsburgh 2 -- Goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck made 39 saves as the 
Panthers held on at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite blowing a 2-0 lead, the Penguins remained unbeaten in overtime at 
4-0-10. They have more overtime games and points than any other NHL team. They 
have played four consecutive overtime games, winning two and tying two.

<P>
 Sacramento King rookie guard Bobby Hurley said Thursday that he hopes to play 
basketball again next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Arco Arena for the first time since his near-fatal car accident on 
Dec. 12, Hurley said doctors have told him the goal is achievable. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my goal," Hurley said at his first news conference since the crash. "I 
think it will take maybe two or three months before I'll be able to shoot a 
basketball. After that, maybe four months before I actually start playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurley looked gaunt and weak, but walked unassisted from the parking lot to 
the news conference, stopping to autograph a basketball for a fan. Golf

 Robin Freeman, making the most of his new life on the tour, capped a 
nine-under-par 63 with a last-hole eagle for a three-shot lead in the opening 
round of the Hawaiian Open. Freeman's bogey-free round over the Waialae Country 
Club course in Honolulu was the best of his four years on the PGA Tour. He is 
the only golfer to lead the tour's qualifying school twice -- in 1988 and last 
year. Brett Ogle and Craig Parry shared second at 66. Tennis

 Defending champion Pete Sampras moved into the final of the New South Wales

final.

<P>
 Michael Jordan, craving a new challenge only months after retiring from the 
Chicago Bulls, wants to play baseball with the Chicago White Sox and has been 
working out at Comiskey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to spring training for one reason and that's to make the team," 
Jordan was quoted as saying in Thursday's editions of the Chicago Tribune. 
"This is no fantasy. I plan to be in Sarasota by mid-February." 
</P>
<P>
 White Sox General Manager Ron Schueler, who said a decision on whether to 
invite Jordan to spring training will be made next month, said that the 
likelihood of Jordan making the team this season "is at best a longshot." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph C. (Mule) Sprinz, a San Francisco Seals catcher known for trying 
unsuccessfully to catch a baseball tossed from a blimp, has died at 91. The 
first ball dropped 800 feet from the "Volunteer" during the 1939 World's Fair 
on Treasure Island hit and broke a bleacher seat. The second ball glanced off 
Sprinz's glove and hit him in the face. Sprinz fractured his jaw and lost four 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Jim Deshaies left the San Francisco Giants and signed a one-year 
contract with the team that traded him to the Giants Aug. 28, the Minnesota 
Twins. . . . Outfielder Daryl Boston, who played for the Colorado Rockies last 
season, signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees. Miscellany

 At least one Wisconsin travel agent made a midnight connection carrying a 
suitcase full of cash to get customers into the Rose Bowl, Wisconsin Attorney 
General James Doyle said. "Trying to get tickets was much like trying to make a 
drug deal," Doyle said by telephone to two California Assembly committees 
investigating the Rose Bowl ticket distribution system. Many fans paid $500 or 
more for a ticket or got stuck without tickets they ordered. . . . China's Wang 
Junxia, who set world records for the women's 3,000 meters and 10,000 meters 
last year, won the 1994 Jesse Owens International Trophy Award. . . . Marty 
Hawkins, the former women's basketball coach at Loyola of Chicago, filed a 
lawsuit against the school, contending he was fired because he spoke out for 
gender equity in Loyola's athletic programs. . . . Richard Park, 17, of Rancho 
Palos Verdes was rated the 10th-best prospect in June's entry draft in mid-term 
rankings issued by the NHL's Central Scouting Bureau. No California-bred player 
has ever been drafted in the first round and none has been rated this high 
since the NHL began keeping data in 1974.

MORNING BRIEFING: CLEMENS TO PADRES TO ASTROS? PUT THIS IN COLD STOVE LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the trade rumors involving the Houston Astros this winter, longtime 
baseball writer Neil Hohlfeld of the Houston Chronicle cites this one as the 
most ludicrous: 
</P>
<P>
 The Providence Journal reported that the Boston Red Sox are talking about 
trading Roger Clemens and third baseman Scott Cooper to the San Diego Padres 
for pitcher Andy Benes and outfielder Derek Bell. Given the Padres' fire-sale 
mania, the report noted that the prospect of the club taking on the remaining 
$16-million of Clemens' contract appears a little curious. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rumor, which has been denied by the teams, went on to note that if 
Clemens and the Padres seem an unlikely match, Padre General Manager Randy 
Smith might engineer a three-way deal that would ultimately land Clemens, a 
Texan, with the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 Writes Hohlfeld: "Since the Astros are looking to slice their payroll, it's 
highly unlikely that General Manager Bob Watson would add Clemens' huge salary. 
Not if he wants to keep his job, anyway. The Astros may still trade pitcher 
Pete Harnisch for a low-cost outfielder before spring training, so the very 
idea of picking up Clemens' salary is absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which NFL team holds the record for most points in a championship 
game? 
</P>
<P>
 Oprah, bonbons and the mall: Jennifer Capriati is on a scheduled five-month 
break from the tennis tour, reportedly because of a nagging elbow injury. But 
Darrell Fry of the St. Petersburg Times writes that those close to Capriati 
believe she has given up being a millionaire tennis pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Thompson, the director of coaching where Capriati trains, told Fry, "I 
think she played before because she thought she was supposed to. I don't think 
she wants to play right now. She's not into it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe she should take a break before she really starts to hate the game. And 
maybe after a while, when she gets sick of going to the mall and all that, 
she'll come back." 
</P>
<P>
 He loves the place: Unless there is a playoff meeting, the Dallas Stars played 
their final game recently in Chicago Stadium, and Dallas' Shane Churla says he 
will miss the place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love playing there," Churla said. "Some guy once threw a trailer hitch at 
me. They're a different breed of fan, but that gets me going. I won't miss the 
cockroaches. I wonder how long it will take before they cross the street (to 
the new arena)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawks and the Bulls will play in the new arena next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong direction: So what is television commentator John Madden's preoccupation 
with "directional punting?" That's what Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post 
wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madden spent more time on directional punting in this one Giants game than 
Les Aspin spent on Mogadishu. Meanwhile, Mike Horan, Mr. Directional Punter 
himself, got a punt blocked by his teammate's keister! Does that make him a 
're-directional punter?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Enough already with directional punting. If you want to punt the ball to the 
sideline, for heaven's sake, just turn and face the sideline." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The Chicago Bears, with a 73-0 victory over the Washington 
Redskins in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Ray Ratto of the San Francisco Examiner, on the trade that sent New 
York Met Vince Coleman to the Kansas City Royals for Kevin McReynolds: "Vince 
Coleman for Kevin McReynolds raises the question: 'Is there deja vu in hell?' "

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; TRAPP FINED $7,500 FOR ROLE IN BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rookie cornerback James Trapp was fined $7,500 by the NFL Thursday for 
fighting against the Denver Broncos while in street clothes last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapp was inactive for the game but was in the bench area when fighting broke 
out in the second quarter. He quickly joined the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 The $7,500 fine equals what Trapp would have received for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL said Trapp was also informed that if he is declared inactive for any 
other postseason games, he will be prohibited from being in the Raiders' bench 
area or elsewhere at field level. The league also said that any other fines 
resulting from the fight will be announced next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapp, who has been inactive the last three weeks because of a groin injury, 
practiced this week and might play Saturday at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last time fullback Steve Smith played at Buffalo, he limped away with an 
ankle injury that has plagued him since. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who has rushed for only 156 yards this season and did not carry the 
ball against Denver, did not practice this week but will play Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing the same thing with Smitty that we've done the last five weeks," 
Coach Art Shell said. "We let him rest during the week and see how he is on 
(game day). Last week, he came in and played some for us." 
</P>
<P>
 With leading rusher Greg Robinson, who also was injured Dec. 5 at Buffalo, at 
least a week away from returning to the lineup, the Raiders will start Ty 
Montgomery at tailback and Napoleon McCallum at fullback for the second 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders seem to have an edge over Buffalo when it comes to special teams. 
Punter Jeff Gossett averaged 41.8 yards a kick during the regular season and 
42.5 in the Raiders' playoff victory over Denver. Buffalo punter Chris Mohr 
averaged 40.4 during the season, 38.4 in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' Tim Brown was among the NFL leaders in punt returns with an 11.6 
average. Russell Copeland leads Buffalo with an 8.8 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket Ismail, who will play despite a neck injury, led the AFC in kickoff 
returns with a 24.2 average. Copeland led the Bills at 18.2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' biggest edge is in field-goal kicking. Jeff Jaeger led the NFL 
with 132 points and a league record-tying 35 field goals. The Bills rely on 
Steve Christie, who had 105 points and 23 field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Eddie Anderson did not practice this week because of a toe injury but 
is expected to play Saturday. If he can't, the Raiders will start Ricky Dixon, 
a six-year veteran who started Super Bowl XXIII for Cincinnati. Rookie safety 
Patrick Bates, who has not played since Dec. 12 because of a thigh injury, is 
expected to be activated. LONNIE WHITE

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: CHANDLER WARMS UP IN THE BOOTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Chandler knows something about playing in Buffalo, where the Raiders will 
endure the cold and wind Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, now a Raider radio commentator, was a wide receiver for the Bills 
for nine seasons before finishing his career with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 It was common for Chandler to play in single-digit temperatures during his 
Buffalo days. But, he says, he never got used to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Bills have an advantage, it's only psychological," Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say it's an advantage for the Bills whenever a team from a 
warm-weather climate comes to Buffalo to play because the Bills are used to the 
cold. When you play for the Bills, you go along with that theory because it 
might give you an edge. But you're just as cold as the other guy. I froze to 
death all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I think the warm-weather team has the advantage. They get to 
practice all week in normal conditions. They get to work up a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was with the Bills, a lot of times (quarterback) Joe Ferguson and I 
would end up playing catch on a racquetball court." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add cold weather: Chandler says the coldest weather he played in was at 
Cleveland, not Buffalo. It was a 1980 playoff game, when he was with the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind-chill factor was about minus 50," he said. "After the temperature 
gets below 20, it really doesn't matter how low it gets. It's the wind that 
kills you." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the most memorable thing about that game in Cleveland, besides Mike 
Davis' game-saving interception in the end zone of a pass by Brian Sipe, was 
Raider center Dave Dalby coming out on the field before the game to greet his 
friends on the Browns wearing only a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cold, what cold?" Dalby said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Chandler: He has been a standout on the Raiders' new broadcasting team 
that includes veteran play-by-play announcer Joel Meyers and newcomer Mike 
Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler's experience has shown. The former USC star was a football 
commentator for NBC and a sports reporter for Channel 7 before getting out of 
sports for a while and serving as co-host of Channel 2's "2 on the Town." He is 
now also the host of the critically acclaimed "Amazing Games" series on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler figures as a candidate for one of Fox's football commentating 
positions next season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Fox: The network made an announcement this week, but it wasn't the hiring 
of John Madden, who appears headed for ABC's "Monday Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox named George Krieger, a former HBO sports vice president, as executive 
vice president of its new sports division. Krieger has been working in business 
development for Fox since July of last year and was previously a senior vice 
president in 20th Century Fox's home video and pay-television division. 
</P>
<P>
 If Madden is out of the picture for Fox, a good choice as its lead commentator 
would be Pat Haden, regarded by some as the second-best in the business behind 
Madden. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was Haden outstanding on TNT during the first half of the season, but 
he has done just as well on CBS radio the second half. He and radio partner 
Howard David are tremendous together. 
</P>
<P>
 David and Haden will be in Buffalo Saturday for CBS radio, but their broadcast 
will be blacked out in Los Angeles to protect Raider flagship station KFI. They 
will also be in Houston on Sunday for the Oilers and Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Buck and Hank Stram will announce the other two playoff games for CBS 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More former Bills: The NBC announcing team on Saturday's 9:30 a.m. 
Raider-Buffalo telecast will be Marv Albert and Paul Maguire, and working the 
sideline will be O.J. Simpson and Cris Collinsworth. Maguire is a former punter 
and linebacker for the Bills and, you may recall, Simpson was a running back 
for the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Maguire, who was with the Bills from 1964 through '70, still lives in Eden, 
N.Y., a Buffalo suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Playoff apathy: Certainly the weather in Buffalo has something to do with it, 
but the Bills, despite a 24-hour extension, were still 6,000 tickets shy of a 
sellout at 6 p.m. Thursday. The Bills were granted another 24-hour extension to 
sell out and lift the local television blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills' playoff game last year against Houston, the comeback game, was also 
blacked out in Buffalo. Capacity at Rich Stadium is 80,290. 
</P>
<P>
 In Detroit last weekend, the Lions fell 25,000 tickets short of selling out in 
time to lift the blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the Raiders were able to sell enough tickets to lift the blackout for 
their game against Denver last Sunday, although they needed two extra days and 
probably wouldn't have sold out if the Coliseum capacity were still 92,488. 
</P>
<P>
 TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 KMPC's Joe McDonnell said Wednesday that the attack on Nancy Kerrigan was not 
a major story because it was figure skating. Ridiculous. It was a huge story 
even before Tonya Harding's former husband and her bodyguard became involved. 
McDonnell had to do an about-face Thursday, when he was all over the story and 
even did an interview with Gary Crowe, the private investigator involved in the 
case. McDonnell might try broadening his horizons beyond basketball, football 
and baseball. It might also broaden his listening audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Latest on the sale of KMPC to Capital Cities is that the sports format may be 
around until the end of April, a source said, and maybe longer if ratings 
continue to climb. . . . XTRA's Lee Hamilton makes a point that if you combine 
the shares of XTRA and KMPC, they bode well for sports-talk radio in Los 
Angeles. In the fall Arbitron book, according to Hamilton, the overall share in 
Los Angeles for men 18-plus was 1.4 for KMPC, 1.6 for XTRA. Together, that's a 
respectable 3.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Mason quit XTRA last Friday to pursue other non-sports broadcasting 
interests. His nighttime partner on "Too Much Show," Rick Schwartz, will now do 
the show solo. "We'll still do wacky stuff and have fun," he said. "But we'll 
also give the show more of a sports flavor than it's had." . . . XTRA sent 
Schwartz to Buffalo. He did Thursday night's show from Buffalo radio station 
WGR and will do tonight's show there, too. Steve Springer, who covers the 
Raiders for The Times, will be Schwartz's first guest tonight. . . . The L.A. 
media are well represented in Buffalo. KROQ-FM even sent Michael (the 
Maintenance Man) Burton to file reports for "Kevin and Bean," the station's 
popular morning show with Kevin Ryder and Gene (Bean) Baxter. 
</P>
<P>
 Reader R.E. Mucko of Covina complains that XTRA, which carried NBC radio's 
Rose Bowl coverage, left the game before its conclusion to pick up the Kings' 
pregame show. Interestingly, Mucko was the only one to complain. Tells you how 
many people were listening to the game on XTRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Doug Christie, an aspiring broadcaster, will be Al Epstein's guest 
commentator on the radio broadcast of Saturday night's Pepperdine-St. Mary's 
game on XTRA (670 only). . . . TBS offers live coverage of the Hawaiian Open 
golf tournament today at 5 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday at 4:30. Vin Scully and 
Bobby Clampett call the shots, with Don Sutton and Donna Caponi serving as 
on-course reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Slater and Ram teammate Jerome Bettis were guests of Arsenio Hall 
Tuesday night. Slater was also a recent in-studio guest on KMPC. It would seem 
a broadcasting career awaits him if he wants it. . . . The Southern California 
Sports Broadcasters Assn. has named Sam Balter as its fourth Hall of Fame 
inductee. Balter, to be honored Feb. 9 at a luncheon at Lakeside Country Club, 
is the group's fourth inductee. The others are Tom Harmon, Bob Kelley and Fred 
Hessler. 
</P>

 Not only is Channel 2 planning to continue its locally produced "L.A. Football 
Co.," but CBS says it will retain "The NFL Today" and expand it to one hour 
next season. However, Terry Bradshaw figures to be long gone by then and Greg 
Gumbel might be gone, too. Gumbel's CBS contract expires in September. . . . 
Pat Summerall and John Madden will be in San Francisco Saturday for the Giants 
and 49ers. Jim Nantz and Randy Cross will work CBS' coverage of the Green 
Bay-Dallas playoff game Sunday. NBC's Dick Enberg and Bob Trumpy draw Sunday's 
Kansas City-Houston game.

teamed up to create a series of Super Bowl-related programming. One of the 
shows in the series, "Who's the Boss?" which focuses on coaches and referees,

-- outstanding. Steve Sabol is the host. . . . Roy Firestone, who continues to 
attract top guests for his "Up Close" show on ESPN, is scheduled to have Cowboy 
Coach Jimmy Johnson and wide receiver Michael Irvin on together via satellite

 Daly report: John Daly, in an interview with Ann Liguori on her national 
television show, "Sports Innerview," had this to say about why he picked up his 
ball and walked off during a tournament in Maui last Nov. 7: "If I'm playing 
bad and I'm going to walk off a golf course, I'm not going to walk up to one of 
the officials and say, 'Hey, my arm's hurt.' I'm not going to lie about it." 
Daly also told Liguori that former Cowboy Thomas Henderson, whom he met during 
a three-week stay at a treatment center in Tucson, has helped him battle 
alcoholism. Liguori's show was on Prime Ticket Thursday and will be repeated 
Sunday night at 9:30.

 A quarterfinal round of a national Dick Vitale sound-alike contest will be 
held at the UCLA student union next Thursday at noon (limit is 50 entrants). 
Before you snicker, consider that the sponsor, Mountain Dew, will donate $5,000 
to the V Foundation, a cancer research fund established by ESPN last year on 
behalf of Jim Valvano. Vitale will be on hand at Thursday's contest to serve as 
a judge. He will work that night's UCLA-Arizona game for ESPN.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; USC BEATS WASHINGTON IN KEY TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cheryl Miller got her biggest win as a head coach and Lisa Leslie had one of 
her best games as USC beat 16th-ranked Washington, 81-70, at USC's Lyon Center 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory -- which ended a nine-game Washington win streak -- put the 
Trojans alone atop the Pacific 10 standings.USC is 10-1 overall and 3-0 in the 
conference. The Huskies dropped to 10-2 and 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, the 6-foot-5 senior post player, dominated against what Miller called 
the best team the Trojans have played this season. Leslie had 25 points on 
10-of-15 shooting from the field, 20 rebounds, six assists, three blocked shots 
and five steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington led for most of the first half, until Leslie's backup, Michelle 
Campbell, scored on a follow with two seconds left to give USC a 39-37 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington regained the lead only briefly after the break. It reached 50-46 
with 12:53 left, but USC's Jody Anton made three free throws, got a steal and 
Tina Thompson scored a layup that put USC up by 51-50. The Huskies never led 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, USC had a 19-point lead after a four-minute, 15-1 burst in the home 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, however, praised Washington's defense, which produced 27 USC 
turnovers.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was the best team we've played; they're much better than Iowa," said 
Miller, whose team lost a controversial, one-point game to second-ranked Iowa 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie was all over the court, diving for loose balls and steals -- and 
avoided her customary foul trouble (she had two personals). 
</P>
<P>
 "I was determined for once not to get in foul trouble in a big game," she 
said. Lorenzo (Orr, the USC men's team star who is her boyfriend) told me not 
to try to block the shot of the player I'm guarding, and it worked."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE ROUNDUP; CAL WORKS OVERTIME TO 
SURPRISE ARIZONA

 Lamond Murray knew he would be getting a pass from Jason Kidd in the final 
seconds of regulation after sixth-ranked Arizona missed a free throw while 
holding a three-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray took the pass and made a three-point shot from the left wing with 3.5 
seconds to play to force overtime. He then made three free throws in the final 
minute of overtime as 19th-ranked California defeated the Wildcats, 98-93, on 
Thursday night at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was good as soon as it left my hand," said Murray, who scored 33 
points. "That's the shot I have to take in that situation, and I stepped up to 
take it. I wanted the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Lute Olson said his team also knew Murray, the leading scorer in 
the Pacific 10 Conference, would be getting the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had great pressure on him, and he still just drilled it in 
there," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Owes, who was guarding Murray on the play, said he didn't jump for a block 
because he was afraid of getting a foul and giving up a four-point play. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, the nation's assist leader, had a triple-double -- 17 points, 11 
rebounds and 11 assists -- and four steals as Cal improved to 10-2 overall and 
3-0 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona is 12-2 and 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 After Cal overcame an 11-point second-half deficit, Kidd tied the score with 
1:33 to play in overtime on a dunk off Anwar McQueen's steal, and Murray made 
the go-ahead free throw with 52 seconds remaining, then added two more free 
throws with 25 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Akili Jones made two free throws to finish the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never let down," Kidd said after Cal dealt Arizona only its third loss in 
its last 103 games in the McKale Center. "When you play at McKale, everybody 
says once you get down, you're down forever. But we proved a point to the 
Pac-10 tonight. If you try, maybe it'll just go your way this time, if you keep 
trying and don't give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cal Coach Todd Bozeman: "Everyone made a big deal on how McKale is such a 
tough place to play. Our players just didn't pay attention to any of that. They 
just wanted to come out and play." 
</P>
<P>
 Khalid Reeves led Arizona with 23 points and teammate Damon Stoudamire scored 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State 78, Stanford 67 -- Stevin Smith scored 19 points to lead the Sun 
Devils (6-5, 1-1) over the Cardinal (9-3, 2-1) at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended the Sun Devils' two-game losing skid. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State trailed, 11-7, in the opening six minutes, but Smith scored 13 
points to spark a 31-6 Sun Devil run over the next 11:35. 
</P>
<P>
 During Arizona State's run, Stanford was held without a field goal for spans 
of 5:34 and 7:11. The Cardinal, which made three of its first four shots, made 
only 25.9% of its shots in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith scored 16 of his points in the first half, and sophomore forward Ron 
Riley added eight as Arizona State took a 38-20 halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State extended its lead to 48-28 before Stanford rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 Brevin Knight scored 17 points for Stanford, all in the second half. Teammates 
Brent Williams and Andy Poppink also scored 17.

KERRIGAN MIGHT SKATE THE WEEK BEFORE OLYMPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If she is physically able to skate, Nancy Kerrigan will make her return to the 
ice in an exhibition at Boston College the week before the Winter Olympics 
begin on Feb. 12, CBS announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Gentile, the network's senior vice president of production, said the 
exact date has not been set, but CBS will televise the exhibition in prime 
time, probably on a one-day tape delay.He guessed it would be after Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's skating competition at the Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, is 
scheduled for Feb. 23 and 25.  
</P>
<P>
 Gentile said Kerrigan will first have to be cleared to skate by the U.S. 
Figure Skating Assn. He said arrangements for the exhibition were made through 
ProServ, the agency that represents Kerrigan, and that other skaters will also 
take part. 
</P>
<P>
 An unspecified rights fee was paid to ProServ, according to Gentile. LARRY

COPING WITH THE CONFUSION; DESPITE MEDIA MOB, KERRIGAN AND FAMILY SEEM TO BE IN 
CONTROL OF THE SITUATION

 Early Thursday morning, the front door to the Kerrigan family's modest home 
opened, bringing the dozens of reporters at the end of the snowy driveway to 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of a comment on the attack that left daughter Nancy, 24, unable to 
defend her U.S. figure skating title in Detroit last week, what was offered 
were a platter of muffins and bagels and copious cups of good, hot coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought you guys could use this," said Nancy's older brother, Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the kind of family Nancy Kerrigan comes from. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Dan, is a welder who worked two jobs for years to pay for figure 
skating lessons for his only daughter. Nancy's mother, Brenda, is legally 
blind. She often sits inches from a special TV to watch the blurred image of 
her daughter on ice. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, with the house under virtual siege by reporters from around 
the world, her brothers, Mike and Mark, have often served as the polite 
spokesmen for a family that is as confused as anyone else about why this 1994 
Olympic gold medal hopeful was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrapped in a leather cheerleader's jacket as she left for her daily physical 
therapy at a hospital not far from this working-class community north of 
Boston, Kerrigan herself waved serenely at reporters. But with questions flying 
at her, she simply smiled and said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, her father emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 "How's she doing?" came the chorus from his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically she's doing good," Dan Kerrigan said. "Physically, she's doing 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan said his daughter, not surprisingly, was distracted by the crowd 
outside the house. Some neighbors agreed, grousing over their snow shovels that 
their local skating champion was being held prisoner by all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dan Kerrigan was confident that his daughter would soon be back on the 
ice. Nancy trains two hours away, on Cape Cod, where fellow skaters praise her 
persistence as wellas her grace and athletic prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the house, Dan Kerrigan stepped aside for yet another delivery of 
flowers and balloons. The family still has big hopes for Lillehammer, Norway, 
site of next month's Winter Olympics, he indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's working her butt off to get back in line," Dan Kerrigan said. Then he, 
too, smiled and waved.

HOLLYPARK IS NEAR DEAL FOR PIMLICO, LAUREL; PURCHASE: PRICE FOR 80% EQUITY 
INTEREST IN MARYLAND TRACKS WOULD BE $15 MILLION. HOLLYWOOD PARK WOULD ALSO 
ASSUME MOST OF REPORTED $40-MILLION DEBT. HUBBARD'S INFLUENCE WOULD INCREASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood Park is close to completing a deal to buy Pimlico Race Course, the 
home of the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore, and Pimlico's sister track in 
Laurel, Md., sources close to the sale said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 R.D. Hubbard, board chairman of Hollywood Park, could not be reached for 
comment, but Maryland sources said that the sale would leave the Inglewood 
track with an 80% equity interest in Pimlico and Laurel. Hollywood Park will 
reportedly pay about $15 million for its share and assume most of the tracks' 
debt, which has been reported at $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pimlico, the second-oldest track in the country, was opened in 1870 and has 
hosted the Preakness, the middle leg of racing's Triple Crown, for 118 years. 
Pimlico is located in the heart of Baltimore, and Laurel, which opened in 1911, 
is located near Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1952, Laurel's signature race has been the Washington D.C. 
International, once a fixture on the calendar for international grass horses 
but a race that has been squeezed out of prominence by other races in the past 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Frank De Francis and his partners bought Laurel in 1984 for $16 
million and two years later acquired Pimlico for $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Since De Francis' death in 1989, his son, Joseph A. De Francis, a 1982 
graduate of the UCLA School of Law, has run the Maryland tracks, but his 
father's partners, brothers Robert T. and Tommy Manfuso, objected to the 
younger De Francis' operating style and retreated from the day-to-day details. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the Manfuso brothers brought the feud to a head by activating a 
buy-sell clause in their contract with De Francis. By next week, De Francis 
would have been obligated to either sell the track to the Manfusos or buy out 
their interest for the same price that they offered him. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Hollywood Park's $15-million payment, the Manfusos are expected to 
receive more than $8 million to complete their buy-sell agreement with De 
Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 De Francis will reportedly remain as president of the tracks with a multiyear 
contract. The De Francis family and other shareholders will wind up with a 20% 
interest in the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryland tracks have struggled in recent years, and De Francis has been 
accused of letting the backstretch area at Pimlico deteriorate and not 
maintaining customer comforts at either track. According to the Manfusos, 
Laurel has operated at a loss of $6.7 million since 1990. A source close to the 
pending Hollywood Park purchase said that Pimlico showed a profit of about $2 
million last year, much of it the result of national television rights that the 
track was paid by ABC for the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been overlaps between the Maryland track executives and Hubbard 
since Hubbard ousted Marje Everett as chairman of Hollywood Park in 1991. De 
Francis and Hubbard were part of different groups that sought a Texas racing 
license in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area. The group now planning to build a track 
there no longer includes Hubbard or De Francis, although Hubbard Enterprises, a 
private company, has a management contract with the new track. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert T. Manfuso, who owns a small amount of stock in Hollywood Park, has 
been a member of Hubbard's board, but Manfuso recently resigned that post. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without Texas, the Maryland deal could make the 58-year-old Hubbard the 
most influential track operator in the United States. Besides his stake of 
about 14% in Hollywood Park, Hubbard is a majority owner of Ruidoso Downs in 
New Mexico, he owns a greyhound track in Portland, Ore., and has a 60% interest 
in the Woodlands, a facility that races horses and greyhounds in Kansas City, 
Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear how the sale of Pimlico and Laurel will affect De Francis' 
interest in building a track in nearby Virginia. The Maryland tracks have been 
one of several groups applying for racing licenses in Virginia, which currently 
does not have parimutuel racing. 
</P>
<P>
 De Francis has had recent conversations with Jack Kent Cooke, owner of the 
Washington Redskins, about building a new football stadium adjacent to the 
Laurel track. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park's imminent purchase of the Maryland tracks comes about two 
months after its board approved in principle the purchase of the Woodlands. 
Business there has fallen off dramatically since it opened in 1989, but Hubbard 
believes that by buying the Woodlands, Hollywood Park will be strategically 
placed for the legalization of casino gambling, which might be placed on a 
referendum there next fall. Hubbard plans to open a card club at Hollywood Park 
in February or March.

CONDITION OF LUKAS IS UPGRADED TO FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thoroughbred trainer Jeff Lukas made further progress Thursday from injuries 
suffered when he was hit by a runaway horse Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 His condition has been upgraded to fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas, 36, had been listed in serious but stable condition since he was moved 
recently from the surgical intensive care unit at Huntington Memorial Hospital 
to a private room. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely doing better," said trainer Randy Bradshaw, a former Lukas 
assistant and family friend. "He did have some help brushing his teeth and 
shaving, but that's certainly to be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still very weak, but I'm sure he'll continue to get stronger. Being in 
bed for 30 days takes its toll, your muscles deteriorate. It'll take time to 
get his strength back." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas is the only son of Eclipse Award-winning trainer Wayne Lukas, who said 
Wednesday that Jeff had been taken off all life-support systems and he had 
gradually come out of his coma.

23 the Bullets have posted back-to-back victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket guard Vernon Maxwell, who was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat 
last week, returned from a three-game absence, scoring 10 points on four-of-10 
shooting in 20 minutes as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 107, Phoenix 88 -- David Robinson had 27 points and 16 rebounds at

MIKE PENNER: BOWDEN HAS TITLE TO GO WITH CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bobby Bowden was standing in the Green Room of the Anaheim Hilton and Towers 
the other day, demonstrating how he finally won a national collegiate football 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 There was not a chalkboard in sight. Nor a football. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just Bobby, chucklin' and joshin' and spinnin' tales and pattin' a 
sportswriter on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where you from?" Bobby asks, as neighborly as can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "How long you been out here?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't I talk to you in Atlanta?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby is just being Bobby, which, according to many college football 
observers, had more to do with Florida State's No. 1 ranking than Charlie Ward 
being Charlie Ward. Writers and fellow coaches vote in the two polls that 
decide such matters, and Bowden is beloved by both. Lou Holtz, on the other 
hand, is not. Yet Holtz has the only football team in the country that beat 
Florida State last season, a team that finished 11-1 and won its bowl game -- 
and finished behind Florida State in every poll that is influenced by the human 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it just because most humans would rather split a plate of biscuits and 
gravy with Bowden? Because most humans prefer Santa to Scrooge? 
</P>
<P>
 Did the force of Bowden's personality sway an entire election? 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have, it could have," Bowden admits, nodding as the question is put 
to him. "I don't know. This stance I take with the media is not a planned 
stance. I do not have a plan to win the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to treat them like everybody else. I try to treat them like my daddy 
taught me . . . be friends with everybody, because my daddy was that way. My 
daddy, he'd walk in the door and his hand would go out like this and he'd shake 
hands with everybody in the room. That stayed with me when I was a kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of the coaches say, 'Bobby does that to get votes and all that.' 
I do not." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, it does seem like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden was in town to take delivery of the championship trophy that had eluded 
him for the first 41 years of his coaching career. It's like they always say: 
The 42nd time's the charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's more a relief for me than anything else," Bowden says. "Before, 
it was kinda like, 'When's he gonna win one? Is he ever gonna win one? Well, 
geez, he's had four chances, what's the matter? What's he missing?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, I'd get kind of embarrassed. Every time I'd see one of my coaches, 
I'd kind of put my hand over my face and try to hide. I know what they were 
thinking: 'Why don't you win one once so we can shut that up?' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Bowden finally broke through two weeks ago, a different type of clamor 
arose, with Holtz doing most of the stoking, and shutting that up may be 
mission impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame Lou at all," Bowden says. "Lou, I really like Lou. I saw him 
here a couple days ago and he and I talked for 30, 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Lou, you probably had the best ball team in the country. I sure 
didn't want to play you again.' You exchange pleasantries . You know how it is 
-- we exchanged pleasantries, like nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have absolutely no resentment toward him. He had a very good point in his 
regard to winning it. (But) I really felt like you should take it on the 
overall season and not base it on one game. 'Who was the best in all of 1993?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's the one thing Florida State did. For 13 games, we played like 
maybe the best team in the country. The day we played Notre Dame, they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden notes, however, that Holtz's view of the situation changed dramatically 
between Halloween and New Year's Day. In October, Holtz was fretting over 
whether his boys could handle Navy. By early January, Holtz had declared his 
boys the best in the land and wondered why the rest of the land wasn't in 
unanimous agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kidded him about that the other night on Jay Leeno ," Bowden says, drawl 
getting the best of him. "I was on Leeno and Jay asks me, 'Well, Lou Holtz says 
his team in the best in the country, how do you reply to that?' 
</P>
<P>
 "So I was tryin' to be halfway funny, and I said, 'Well, you know when we 
played Notre Dame, Lou said we were the best team he'd ever seen. Lou said we 
might be the best team he'd seen in 10 years. Lou said we might be the best 
team he'd seen in 20 years. Lou said that he didn't know if they could hold us 
to 40.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Lou did so good a job selling us, they voted us the national championship.' 
He was the oversale." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden tosses his head back and cackles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to play him next year, so I got to break him of that somehow. That 
rascal. He is the master . . . he is the master of making your kids think 
they're better than they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose they had played again this season, in a winner-takes-all championship 
game that the masses in and outside of South Bend are now pressing for. 
</P>
<P>
 Could Florida State have beaten Notre Dame in a January rematch? 
</P>
<P>
 "We might-could," Bowden says. "At least we'd have the advantage of playin' 
them with our kids at their peak. He did get a week of practice on us (in the 
November game). In a week's time, you can put in some things you can't do in 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I couldn't predict we would beat them. We had the kind of ballclub this 
year, though, that if I was a betting man and I was neutral, I would bet on 
whoever had Charlie Ward. You put him on a lot of teams and they're gonna win." 
</P>
<P>
 Stupendous Bowl '94 didn't come off, although Bowden sees a four-team college 
football playoff in the near future. "It won't be because of the debating," 
Bowden says, "it'll be because of money. You schools want us to help pay some 
bills, we'll get you a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the debating and the arguing, I think, are probably healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 For Florida State it has been. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything else being equal, as it stands now, this year you had to bet on 
whoever had Bobby Bowden.

COTTON KEEPS HIS COOL; MATER DEI FRESHMAN TRANSFER ABLE TO TUNE OUT THE 
APPLAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Schea Cotton makes people nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei's opponents are wary. They all knew of his reputation even before 
the 6-foot-5, 215-pound freshman transferred from Bellflower St. John Bosco in 
December. It's not often a freshman can create such fear, but Cotton is not an 
ordinary freshman . . .  
</P>
<P>
 . . . And that's why Monarch Coach Gary McKnight is careful, even guarded. 
It's an uneasiness that's understandable, because everyone -- and that means 
everyone -- is predicting great things from Cotton . . .  
</P>
<P>
 . . . And that makes Cotton's parents skittish. Their son is talented, they 
know that. At 15, he is already coveted by college coaches. James Sr. and 
Gaynell are leery of publicity, to the point where they rarely grant interview 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
 So everyone, from family to friends to foes, seems to be on edge. Everyone, 
that is, except Schea Cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to stay away from all that stuff," Cotton said. "I play for myself. You 
have to keep yourself happy first of all. I'll deal with everything else 
later." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it might be later than he thinks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, Cotton has no one to blame but himself for all this attention. He 
does things that no 15-year-old should be able to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Dana Hills last week, Cotton took a lob pass on the base line and 
rammed home a dunk. "A seven on the Schea Cotton scale," according to 
</P>
<P>
 Monarch reserve guard Kevin Augustine, a long-time friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Cotton drilled back-to-back three-pointers. So he's a threat, 
inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to believe he's a high school kid, then you realize he's only a 
freshman and go, 'Wow!' " Dana Hills Coach Jim Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Orange Coach Richard Bossenmeyer: "It's one thing for a kid to dunk off a 
fast break. But this kid grabs rebounds and powers it right through. There 
aren't strong-enough superlatives to describe him." 
</P>
<P>
 In eight games with Mater Dei, Cotton has averaged 18.3 points and 9.1 
rebounds. Outstanding numbers for a kid playing on an extremely talented team, 
one that includes Arizona-bound guard Miles Simon, who is averaging 20.2 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen a kid that does the things (Schea) does," said McKnight, 
who has coached more than his share of talented players at Mater Dei. "He has 
college-type moves, and he has a man's body. I sometimes forget that he's only 
a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
 That can slip your mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at his tender age, Cotton can mean a lot to a program, even one as good 
as Mater Dei's. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he arrived, the Monarchs were undefeated and playing well. But they 
were not recognized by USA Today in its national poll. That changed when Cotton 
changed schools. As of last week, Mater Dei was ranked 15th and was No. 2 in 
the West, behind Los Angeles Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton was the only high school freshman invited to the Nike Career 
Developmental Weekend, which featured 37 of the country's top prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 With such accolades, it's difficult to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get things out of proportion and they forget how old I am," Cotton 
said. "They look at my size and think I'm a man. But you know, I still have the 
mind of a teen-ager. I'm liable to make mistakes, but people don't think I 
should." 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of the reasons the Cottons have tried to keep their son out of the 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 According to McKnight, the family turned down invitations to two prominent 
summer basketball camps when Cotton was in eighth grade -- camps that usually 
only bother with high school juniors and seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations have been building since Cotton began playing basketball. It has 
always been obvious that he is a cut above the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got the instinct or whatever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton was a superior player by the time he was in junior high school. He was 
already dunking when he was in the seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard Schea could dunk," said Augustine, who has known Cotton since 
elementary school. "We had a water break during practice one day. One of the 
guys said, 'Let's see if you can do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cotton: "They wanted to see it. I made believers out of them. I guess 
dunking is a big thing to those who can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton's development also was helped when he was held back in the sixth 
grade,when his family moved from San Pedro to Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaynell Cotton said their concerns about gang problems led them to put their 
son at St. Irenaeus Catholic School in Cypress. Since the school did not have 
any openings for a seventh-grade student, Cotton repeated the sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We enrolled him at a public junior high school, but he was chased by boys the 
first week," Gaynell Cotton said. "One day, a boy showed Schea a knife. It was 
to show Schea that he was going to need something to protect himself." 
</P>
<P>
 But some coaches have speculated that the Cottons held their son back for 
basketball reasons. Such talk, Gaynell Cotton said, has led the family to avoid 
interviews. She said they have also remained aloof to keep their son's feet on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball is not a one-person sport," Gaynell Cotton said. "If it was, it 
would be golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard about kids who get too much publicity and, all of a sudden, their 
heads are as big as a gym. So far, knock wood, Schea has kept a level head. 
That's why we haven't spoken to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, attention was unavoidable when Cotton left St. John Bosco. 
</P>
<P>
 James Cotton Jr., Schea's older brother, played two seasons at St. John Bosco. 
But Schea played in only four games for the Braves, averaging 14.5 points, 
before leaving.  
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't play under Coach (Brian) Breslin," Cotton said. "My brother had 
success there, but I just felt uncomfortable. When I'm uncomfortable, I don't 
play to my ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton said he wanted to attend Mater Dei all along, but his parents preferred 
that he go to St. John Bosco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt as parents that his brother went there, so Schea would not be a 
stranger," Gaynell Cotton said. "The school had great academics. Also, there 
were no girls, so Schea could keep focused. But he was unhappy with the 
basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always said that you have a social life, academics and basketball. If 
one is out of balance, then all three are out of balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Breslin said Cotton never talked to him about leaving. But Breslin said he 
spoke with Cotton's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought it was in Schea's best interest," Breslin said. "I'm a parent 
myself. It's their responsibility to make those decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have not been so generous. Cotton's transfer raised plenty of eyebrows, 
not to mention a few questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The family, who had moved back to San Pedro two years ago, then moved to 
Huntington Beach last month. Southern Section officials said the move was 
verified, which made Cotton immediately eligible at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw (Mater Dei) before Cotton arrived and they were a very, very fine 
team," an Orange County high school coach said. "But, if they had one weakness, 
it was (at the small forward). Cotton has filled that. It's amazing how it 
worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Schea Cotton: "This is where I am. I don't look back." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Cotton has looked ahead. The goal, he said, is to be an impact player 
in the NBA. It's a lofty aspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a long way to go," Cotton said. "That's why I don't worry about all 
the publicity. If people show me articles, I say, 'That's fine.' But I'm not 
going to be showing you my photo and bragging on it. I have to keep a cool 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 He'll let others do the fretting.

LEFFERTS, 36, SIGNS FOR ONE YEAR WITH ANGELS; BASEBALL: LEFT-HANDER WILL BE 
USED PRIMARILY AS MIDDLE RELIEVER OR SETUP MAN BUT MIGHT BE A SPOT STARTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It hardly is the elixir to all of their bullpen woes, but the Angels acquired 
what they believe will be invaluable experience Thursday when they signed 
left-hander Craig Lefferts to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts is guaranteed $400,000 in 1994 and is eligible to earn a total of 
$900,000 in incentives if he appears in 68 games or pitches 90 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts, 36, the Texas Rangers' opening day starter last season, becomes the 
Angels' first free-agent signee of the winter. He will be used primarily as a 
middle reliever and setup man, but also can be a spot starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're realistic about everything," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said, 
"but we think he can help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts, who made eight starts and 44 relief appearances last season for 
Texas, was 3-9 with a 6.05 earned-run average. He became a free agent after 
last season when the Rangers did not exercise the option on his $1.1-million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "My numbers were bad," said Lefferts, who was 2-4 with a 3.86 ERA in relief, 
"but they don't show what I could do. I'm looking forward to pitching a whole 
lot of innings, and providing leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts not only becomes the oldest member of the Angels, but his 666 career 
games are twice the combined total of the entire Angel bullpen. Lefferts fills 
the void left by Steve Frey, who signed with the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve's departure opened up a slot," said agent Steve Comte, who also 
represents Frey. "If you look across the board, Craig was the best left-hander 
available. I honestly believe that Craig wants to prove to people that last 
year was an aberration." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi also had contract negotiations Thursday with free-agent left-hander Bob 
Patterson and Angel reliever Joe Grahe, who's eligible for salary arbitration. 
Grahe is expected to file today for arbitration if no agreement is reached, and 
exchange salary figures Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels still are holding out hope of signing free-agent reliever Gregg 
Olson. They have offered an incentive-laden proposal that could turn into a 
four-year contract if Olson remains healthy. Jeff Moorad, Olson's agent, said a 
decision is expected to be made within a week.

GIRLS' ROUNDUP; ROBBINS COMES UP BIG IN MARINA'S VICTORY OVER SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Junior forward Shandy Robbins had a career-high 32 points and added 14 
rebounds as Marina beat Santa Ana, 55-43, in a Sunset League girls' basketball 
game Thursday at Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins' previous high was 24 points earlier this season. Marina (11-5, 4-1 in 
league) is the sixth-ranked team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Karina Gonzalez had 11 points for Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Sunset League games: 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 61, Edison 52 -- Jen Ludwicki, a sophomore forward, scored 19 
points for host Fountain Valley (12-4, 4-1), the fifth-ranked team in the 
county. Marie Philman had 29 for Edison (10-6, 1-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 60, Huntington Beach 46 -- Freshman guard Jennifer Tuiolosega 
scored 22 points, including four three-pointers, for No. 7 Ocean View (15-3, 
4-1). Monica Geraci had 16 points for visiting Huntington Beach. 
</P>

BOYS' ROUNDUP; PACIFICA ENDS KENNEDY'S STREAK AT 37 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kennedy's 37-game Garden Grove League winning streak ended Thursday night with 
a 95-81 loss to a Pacifica team that was a good as advertised. But afterward, 
the visiting Fighting Irish weren't conceding anything to the fifth-ranked 
Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any team can be beaten on any given night," Kennedy senior guard Wes Morris 
said. "They just happened to be the better team tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica was certainly the deeper team and the better perimeter-shooting team. 
The Mariners came at Kennedy in waves as Pacifica Coach Bob Becker used 11 
players liberally. The Mariners led, 45-44, at halftime, but wore down Kennedy 
in the second half with their size and their relentless three-point shooting 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Teague (19 points, four three-pointers) broke the game open by hitting 
two three-pointers from the corner in Pacifica's 13-0 run that opened the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of my favorite shots to shoot on the floor," Teague said. "I just 
thank my teammates for getting me the ball and God for letting the ball go in." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kennedy Coach John Mayberry: "It's funny because at halftime I told our 
team to watch out for 30 (Teague) and 54 (Chris Vlasic)." 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic did much of his damage after halftime too. Saddled with three fouls in 
the first half, Vlasic scored 11 of his 19 points after halftime and also 
grabbed six of his nine rebounds after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fighting Irish (5-10, 3-1 in league) closed to within five points twice in 
the fourth quarter, but every time they got close Pacifica (13-1, 4-0) would 
usually counter with a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can shoot, and they don't stop shooting," Mayberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Morris (18 points, six steals) wasn't convinced of anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "They outplayed us, but I just can't wait to play them again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Academy League: 
</P>
<P>
 St. Margaret's 88, Vista Cal Lutheran 30 -- Damian Raibon scored 16 points to 
lead three St. Margaret's players in double figures. St. Margaret's is 10-3, 
2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Metro League: 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Shores 54, Colton Christian Center Academy 53 -- Josh Kalb scored a 
layup with eight seconds left to give host Pacific Shores the victory. Kalb had 
a team-high 15 points for Pacific Shores (5-4, 3-2).

SOUTH COAST LEAGUE GIRLS' ROUNDUP; TIME IS ON SAN CLEMENTE'S SIDE IN BEATING 
COUGARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Capistrano Valley's first-half confusion reappeared at the most inopportune 
time Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pivotal South Coast League girls' basketball game against San Clemente at 
Capistrano Valley, the Cougars tried to take a last-second shot, but time was 
on the Tritons' side. 
</P>
<P>
 Final score: San Clemente 55, Capistrano Valley 54. 
</P>
<P>
 To set up the victory, San Clemente ace Michelle Macintyre had scored with 
less than a minute to play for the one-point edge. Capistrano Valley's Susan 
Scott, who made nine of her first 13 free-throw attempts before missing three 
in a row, was fouled and stepped to the line for two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 She missed both. San Clemente subsequently gained possession on a jump ball 
situation, and after letting the clock run down, the Cougars fouled Alicia 
Waldner, who missed the front end of the one-and-one. 
</P>
<P>
 With eight seconds left, Capistrano Valley's Jennifer Garrett rebounded the 
missed shot, hurriedly brought the ball up court, but was double-teamed. By the 
time she broke free, the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she thought she had more time," said Scott, who led all scorers with 
29 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Scott said it was an uncharacteristic game for the Cougars. "We were confused, 
we were nervous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente was not. The Tritons (12-4, 2-1) hadn't defeated Capistrano 
Valley (8-5, 2-1) in nine attempts over the previous two seasons and agreed it 
was high time to turn the tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine times in a row, we really wanted to change that. We wanted it so bad and 
we knew we could do it," said Macintyre, who led the Tritons with 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley led early in the game, but San Clemente outscored the 
Cougars, 20-14, in the second quarter to take a 27-24 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, the Tritons took a six-point lead three times, but the 
Cougars came back and even pulled ahead, 54-53, on a layup by Scott with 1:01 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente employed a full-court press that dogged the Cougars throughout 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense played real well," Macintyre said. "Everyone seemed to step it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 For San Clemente, Kate Turnbull had 17 points. Teammate Jenny Geminert, who 
sat out much of the second half in foul trouble, added seven. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills 59, Mission Viejo 41 -- Karun Grossman scored 34 points, including 
19 of the team's 22 first-half points, to lead Dana Hills (12-4, 2-1). Courtney 
Okura scored 12 points for Mission Viejo (0-3 in league). 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 86, El Toro 32 -- Adrienne Botana scored 16 points to lead five 
Mater Dei players in double figures. Mater Dei is 13-2, 3-0; Host El Toro is 
5-9, 0-3.

PREP NOTES: RULES COMMITTEE OKS WEARING CERTAIN CASTS DURING GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High school football players will be permitted to wear some kinds of casts and 
splints during games, under a rules change adopted by the National Federation 
Football Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also made two changes in sportsmanship rules during its meeting 
last weekend in Point Clear, Ala., the National Federation of State High School 
Assns. announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule changes go into effect for the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee voted to allow casts or splints made of hard, abrasive or 
unyielding substances for the hand, wrist, forearm or elbow if they are covered 
with half-inch thick, closed-cell polyurethane and is approved in writing by a 
licensed physician. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA has had a similar rule for 10 years, and a half-dozen states 
experimented with the new high school rule last season. 
</P>
<P>
 In another change, any substitute who leaves the team box and enters the 
playing field during a fight will be ejected. Taunting and any delayed, 
excessive or prolonged act by which a player attempts to focus attention on 
himself will also be penalized as unsportsmanlike conduct for 15 yards.

COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL PREVIEW; CSUN TAKING HITS BEFORE FIRST VOLLEY FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge men's volleyball team has been practicing twice a day 
for the past two weeks, but its fate this season might be determined elsewhere 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Three key members of the team, including top recruit Jason Hughes, are 
enrolled in interim classes, struggling to regain their academic eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, left-side hitter Cameron Green and middle blocker Ed Bond will be 
sidelined when Northridge opens its season today with pool play at the UC Santa 
Barbara tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three, only Hughes, a freshman hitter from Royal High, is a starter. 
But Green and Bond are top reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "With young teams you have inconsistencies, and that's where depth becomes a 
bigger factor," said Coach John Price, who last season guided Northridge to a 
23-10 record and a berth in the NCAA title match. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if the Matadors are anything, they are young. Of 19 players on the 
roster, 14 are freshmen or sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Northridge has been toppled from the ranks of collegiate giants. 
Despite being ranked among the top four in the final poll the past four 
seasons, the Matadors begin the season unranked by one publication and tabbed 
ninth by another. 
</P>
<P>
 Price considers the snub a "lack of respect thing," but the players say they 
have grown accustomed to working their way up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a chronic thing with our team," said Gary Reznick, one of two seniors 
bidding to take over for Matt Unger at setter. "Every season we come out either 
low in the polls or not in them at all. And we always come out with something 
to prove." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge faces this season without Coley Kyman, a three-time All-American, 
anchoring the middle. And without two-time All-Americans Ken Lynch and Axel 
Hager as front-line bookends. And without the fiery Unger running the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the other side, that's why we are where we are in the rankings," Price 
said. "We lost our four best players. If you think about it logically and 
rationally, we've done nothing to deserve being higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Middle blocker Craig Hewitt and left-side hitter Peter Piexoto are the only 
returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both good players, but hardly household names, even in the volleyball 
community," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt, a 6-foot-7 senior, last season had a .447 attacking percentage -- 
remarkably similar to the success-ratio Kyman enjoyed with a team-best .453 
hitting average. Kyman often was double-teamed while Hewitt hit against one 
defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Price expects Hewitt and Piexoto to contribute consistently now that they have 
moved into leadership roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Another on-court leader will be the survivor of a duel at setter between 
Reznick and Chris McGee, both fifth-year seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Reznick was a starter as a freshman and Unger's understudy the following two 
seasons before redshirting last year. McGee redshirted his first season, was 
third setter the next two campaigns and was Unger's backup last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They both will play and get their chances," said Price, who plans to 
alternate the two today and Saturday in the tournament. "The winner will be 
whoever is most consistent during January." 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Urcan, a redshirt sophomore, replaces Kyman in the middle. Collin Smith, 
a freshman from Soquel High near Santa Cruz, steps in for Hager. 
</P>
<P>
 Urcan's quick hitting skills make him a prime offensive threat, but at 
6-foot-4 he is somewhat short for a top blocker. Smith, also 6-4, was voted 
most valuable player on a U.S. Junior National Team that toured Canada last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 When -- or if -- Hughes becomes eligible, he is likely to take over at 
opposite hitter, a spot patrolled for the past four seasons by Lynch. Hughes is 
6-7 and already fairly polished. Price considered him "the best high school 
player in the country last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the team's youth, Price is convinced the Matadors have enough talent 
to repeat their Cinderella script of last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to do what we did last year," he said. "To get better as the year 
goes on and peak at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA last season earned the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation's automatic 
berth to the final four. Northridge, MPSF tournament champion, also advanced to 
the final four. The Bruins defeated the Matadors in the NCAA championship match 
before a crowd of 8,482 at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said UCLA, which is top-ranked again this season, is poised for a repeat 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA is head and shoulders above everybody else," he said. "They have the 
best talent every year." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, Brigham Young and USC have the most experience in what should be a 
rebuilding year for many of the nation's perennially strong programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is among those programs, but Matador players believe their 
preseason ratings are not indicative of the team's talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys were pretty upset about the rankings, but to me it only means 
that we have a lot to prove and nothing to lose," McGee said.

HASTE LAYS MOORPARK'S WINNING STREAK TO WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As hard as he tried, Moorpark College basketball Coach Al Nordquist could 
barely camouflage his disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 It's doubtful anyone in his position could have. 
</P>
<P>
 Not when your team slips and lets a commanding lead vanish. Not when you can 
smell another victory in what has been a successful season so far for the 
Moorpark College men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, despite leading by 14 points early in the second half Thursday 
night, lost a Western State Conference interdivisional game, 96-87, to Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat snapped a 10-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we let the tempo get away from us (in the second half)," Nordquist 
said. "We let it get to a faster pace than we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 With the faster tempo, the Raiders (17-5, 4-1 in conference play) had problems 
stopping the transition game of Santa Monica (14-6, 4-1). The Raiders also 
hurried their shots instead of working the ball around with the crisp passes 
that opened scoring opportunities inside the key early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark led at the half, 47-39, and went on an 8-2 run after intermission to 
take a 55-41 advantage. Guard Jaime Jaquez (eight points) and center Rahmid 
Stinson (17 points) each scored four points in the rally, many thanks to 
excellent passing by the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorpark inexplicably started to force some shots and allowed the Corsairs 
to get back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying to penetrate and do it all by ourselves rather than being 
patient," Nordquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 The slower tempo worked well for Moorpark in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for the open man constantly, the Raiders shot a blazing 51.5% from the 
field in the first 20 minutes of play and no one benefited more from the 
controlled tempo than guard Sean Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore from Agoura High scored 21 of his game-high 30 points in the 
half, including an NBA-range three-point basket at the buzzer. It was the 
fourth consecutive three-pointer in the half for Martin, who had six in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we weren't putting up much resistance in the first half," Santa 
Monica Coach John McMullen said.  
</P>
<P>
 But sophomore guard James Gray and freshman guard Davy Fortson led the Corsair 
uprising in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray scored 13 of his team-high 25 points in the second half and Fortson had 
12 of his 18 points in the period to rally Santa Monica. Gray's backhanded slam 
with 10 seconds to play gave the Corsairs a 94-82 cushion before Fortson hit 
two free throws and got two more points on a dunk as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to extend our defense so they couldn't pick us apart with all those 
inside passes," McMullen said. "I feel fortunate we found a way to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Corsairs helped their cause with 24-of-25 free-throw shooting.

LUBSEY LEADS MASTER'S TO EASY VICTORY; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: HE SCORES 18, MOSTLY 
FROM INSIDE, AS MUSTANGS RIP POINT LOMA NAZARENE, 112-76. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Need a few examples of how dominant The Master's College was in Thursday's 
nonconference men's basketball game against visiting Point Loma Nazarene? 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs hit 56.8% of their shots from the field in the first half to take 
an 18-point lead at intermission, then topped that mark in the second half 
(58.3%), despite clearing their bench with six minutes left in a 112-76 blowout 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Colin Lubsey scored 18 points for The Master's (16-3) while connecting 
on seven of 10 shots from the field. Three of Lubsey's seven baskets came on 
dunks and another three were layups. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubsey scored his final points on a three-point play with 10:45 left in the 
game to give the Mustangs a 79-53 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 During one stretch in the second half, The Master's scored 10 baskets on 13 
possessions and none of the Mustangs' shots came from further than three feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a good night for us," The Master's Coach Bill Oates said in a 
massive understatement. "Everyone got to play. Everyone contributed. . . . 
There are certain things we could have done better, but overall, it was a good 
game for us. We shot the ball well. We boarded well and we shared the ball 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Lubsey concurred with his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real nice game," he said. "It was a lot of fun. It was really a team 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The win was the fifth in a row for the Mustangs and their 12th in the last 13 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Pt. Loma Nazarene (8-9) took a 2-0 lead on a basket by Eddie Morgan, but even 
then it became obvious that the Crusaders were going to be in for a long night 
as Morgan's points came after a Taylor Golonka shot was blocked by Lubsey. 
</P>
<P>
 The final play of the first half put an exclamation point on the Mustangs' 
dominance as Mike Penberthy hit a two-point shot at the buzzer while being 
fouled.  
</P>
<P>
 He converted the free throw with no time left on the clock to give The 
Master's a 52-34 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs scored at will to start the second half, but less-than-stellar 
defense allowed the Crusaders to stay within 18 to 20 points until The Master's 
went on an 18-8 run to take an 81-53 lead with 10:25 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Master's made seven of eight shots from the field during that stretch, 
which was capped by a Penberthy layup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to back off in a game like this," Lubsey said. "But then you have 
to get your head back on straight and that's what we did. We started hitting 
the boards, getting out on the break, passing the ball and running our 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
 All 12 Mustang players scored, led by Emeka Okenwa with 19 points, Lubsey, 
Rogerio Soares (17) and James Mosley (15). 
</P>
<P>
 Okenwa added a game-high 15 rebounds with point guard Andy Thompson 
contributing eight points and a game-high 11 assists.

HAMBLIN PLAYS OUT DREAM; VILLAGE CHRISTIAN ATHLETE OVERCOMES BROKEN NECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moments after sinking a baseline jump shot Tuesday night against Marshall 
Fundamental, Village Christian High's Pat Hamblin realized the dream he had 
been replaying in his mind since August. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just a simple 12-foot shot that hit nothing but net, but it meant much 
more to Hamblin than the first two points of his varsity career. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five months ago, doctors told Hamblin -- a two-sport athlete -- he could 
forget about playing basketball and baseball during his senior year. Last 
summer in San Diego, Hamblin ran into the ocean surf only to be carried out -- 
strapped to a stretcher -- by four lifeguards minutes later. Hamblin had 
suffered a broken neck. He was placed in a full-torso brace and was scheduled 
to undergo surgery by the first of the year. Doctors predicted his 
post-operative rehabilitation would last a full year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hamblin, a 6-foot, 190-pound guard, proved the prognosis wrong when he 
stepped on the court five months after the accident and promptly sank a jump 
shot. He just as promptly celebrated by passing out high-fives at midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit the shot and I was at half court when I realized what I had done," 
Hamblin said. "Envisioning that and then having it happen was really neat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Village Christian crowd erupted with cheers when Hamblin sank the shot. 
Not because the shot had anything to do with game -- the Crusaders led by 30 
points with less than two minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went nuts because most of the people here know the story behind Pat," 
said Mike Plaisance, the school's athletic director and football coach who 
attended the game. "He is such a dynamic kid. Through it all he's been really 
positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamblin's road to recovery began five months ago, shortly after the accident 
on Aug. 3. Hamblin and three of his friends drove to San Diego for a few days 
of sun, surf and a baseball game between the San Diego Padres and San Francisco 
Giants at Jack Murphy Stadium. After arriving in San Diego, the group headed to 
Silver Strand Beach in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
 During a mud fight near the shoreline, Hamblin bolted for the water to escape 
his mud-flinging friends. As he ran into the surf, a knee-high wave tripped him 
and sent him headfirst into the wet sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamblin immediately knew something was wrong. When he called for help, his 
friends ignored him, thinking he was acting. "None of my friends came because 
they thought I was fooling around," Hamblin said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, someone nearby heard Hamblin's distress call and tracked down a 
lifeguard, who instructed Hamblin to stay put in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Three more lifeguards arrived and placed Hamblin in a neck brace from his chin 
to his upper abdomen and then strapped him to a board. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was on the backboard, I didn't realize the severity of it," said 
Hamblin, who continued to joke with the lifeguards throughout the ordeal. 
"While I was on the backboard, I was telling the guys, 'You people sure don't 
look like the people on 'Baywatch.' " 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays and other tests revealed that Hamblin had broken his sixth vertebra. 
But Hamblin still didn't get the picture until the doctor said, "You broke your 
neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Only then did Hamblin understand how close he came to permanent paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of times I'd really get down," he said. "(I thought) why is this 
happening to me? I had to realize God is in control. Why ever this happened, 
there's a reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamblin remained in an upper-torso brace 24 hours a day for 2 1/2 months, but 
the cast was removed nearly six weeks earlier than expected. He healed so well, 
doctors canceled plans for reconstructive surgery. Hamblin attributes the quick 
recovery to prayer and his religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what helped me out a lot was when other people started hearing about 
it and people started praying about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After he spent several games sitting on the bench in street clothes and being 
mistaken by referees for a Village Christian basketball coach, Hamblin worries 
about getting more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there's no more extenuating circumstances," Hamblin joked. 
</P>
<P>
 And for that, he is thankful.

KERRIGAN ATTACK A BLACK MARK FOR SPORT, CHIN SAYS; FIGURE SKATING: FORMER 
OLYMPIAN ALSO ASSAILS IMMATURE ATHLETES WITH UNREALISTIC ATTITUDES WHO PAY 
LITTLE HEED TO ELEGANCE AND CHARM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When figure skater Nancy Kerrigan was attacked and injured last week and 
forced out of the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, she was not the only 
casualty. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport also suffered as a result of the assault and the reports that four 
men associated with U.S. champion Tonya Harding might have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the view of former Olympian Tiffany Chin of Toluca Lake. Chin, 
26, who teaches children at the Iceoplex in North Hills, was a freestyle skater 
who placed fourth in the 1984 Olympics and competed for 11 years before 
retiring in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 She shares the outrage that others have expressed about the incident and likes 
little about the sport now, saying that spoiled skaters and twisted attitudes 
have robbed the sport of much of its charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have changed a lot," she said during a break between lessons Thursday. 
"It used to be that class and elegance and charm were associated with the 
sport. That doesn't exist anymore. Before skaters were more groomed and 
polished. Now they are willing to say harsh things." 
</P>
<P>
 Chin faults immaturity among current skaters who often experience success at 
an early age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's because kids get to the top faster and at a younger age," Chin 
said. "Champions used to be 18 and 22; now they're real young. You get them at 
that rebellious stage and they don't realize the impact they have on kids. 
There seems to be a general disregard for role models." 
</P>
<P>
 Iceoplex General Manager Susan Bernes says the competition is fierce among 
prominent skaters. Bernes was on the U.S. national figure skating team in 
1966-67 and skated professionally with the Ice Follies for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You basically give up your life," she said. "Your whole life is focused on 
skating. You get up at 4 in the morning to skate and you go until it hurts. 
There's a lot of pressure to win." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pickwick Ice Skating Center in Burbank, skaters and their coaches 
appeared uneasy when they spotted reporters. A television news crew interviewed 
an instructor while young skaters watched and mumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 David Liu, 28, is a two-time Olympian from Taiwan training for the upcoming 
World Championships in Japan. He hesitated before talking about the incident, 
saying he is a friend of both Harding and Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly it's very competitive, but it's different off the ice," Liu said. 
"But I think it's more cutthroat with the women than the men." 
</P>
<P>
 Chin fears that the Kerrigan incident will discourage young people from the 
sport. Already, she sees promising skaters questioning their commitment. 
</P>

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: FOWLER RETURNS TO HEALTH, BASKETBALL

 Thirteen months ago, Dennis Fowler left Stanford Medical Center in a 
wheelchair and made a vow to play basketball again -- that is, if he could walk 
properly after his left leg had to be reconstructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler, a sophomore at College of Notre Dame in Palo Alto who played at Agoura 
High, suffered a broken tibia and fibula in a November, 1992, car accident. But 
his most crucial injury -- one that threatened his mobility for life -- was a 
splintered shin. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in the trauma room, there was no mention of basketball," said 
Fowler, a 6-foot-2, 150-pound guard. "I asked if I'd ever be able to walk 
again. I figured if I could walk . . . I could play basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler returned to Notre Dame in September with a severe limp, but last Friday 
he made a stirring return to basketball when he played the final four minutes 
of a 91-71 victory over Sonoma State. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first 30 seconds, he hit a three-pointer," Coach Pat Fuscaldo said. "It 
was pretty amazing. It was the first time he'd stepped on a court in two years. 
He goes one for one from the field and gets two assists in four minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a blowout game and a couple of guys asked the coach to play me," 
Fowler said. "A lot was going through my mind then. I was thinking about the 
accident, my family and all the friends who stuck by me. But when I ran up to 
the scorer's table -- and I heard everybody in the stands cheering -- my mind 
was on only basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as soon as I made that shot, it all reverted back to everything I went 
through. I knew I'd be calling my parents right after the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The injuries -- suffered in a high-speed freeway crash -- forced Fowler to 
redshirt last season. Fuscaldo planned to have Fowler apply for a medical 
redshirt this season, but then Fowler started making rapid progress. 
</P>
<P>
 He went from jogging with the team occasionally in September to participating 
in the team's first practice on Oct. 1. But as late as mid-November, Fowler 
couldn't play defense -- he couldn't slide or jump, and he had to avoid 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was about the anniversary of the accident -- Nov. 28, when teammate and 
former Reseda High player Jeff Gilmore fell asleep at the wheel while Fowler 
slept in the back seat of the car that flipped on a freeway near the campus -- 
that Fowler suddenly showed improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started doing a great job on the scout team," Fuscaldo said. "He was 
getting stronger and stronger every day. And he kept scoring (against) the 
first team. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time of his accident, I thought his injuries were not just career 
threatening but life threatening. He wasn't looking too good." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler and his family convinced Fuscaldo in December to drop the medical 
redshirt idea and let him play. Fuscaldo said Fowler's playing time will 
increase as he gets stronger, but Fowler won't be 100% until a metal rod in his 
leg, a plate on his outer ankle and pins and screws in his ankle and knee are 
removed. The Argonauts entered the week 7-6, 2-0 in the Division II Northern 
California Athletic Conference.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know I have a lot of support, and I realize basketball is not the most 
important thing," Fowler said. "But I'm just glad I'm back to where I can play. 
I'm just satisfied with making it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: Cal Poly Pomona's Bobby McRae (Cleveland) ranks second on 
the team in assists with 38 but has struggled as a scorer. He is shooting 29.2% 
from the field and averages 5.1 points a game. . . . Michelle Kerzie 
(Paraclete) has the second-highest free-throw shooting percentage (83.3%) for 
the Cal Poly Pomona women. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis-Clark senior forward Kurt Schwan (Westlake) is averaging 6.7 points and 
5.7 rebounds. . . . Azusa Pacific senior Shannon Solway (Simi Valley/College of 
the Canyons) leads the Cougars in rebounding average (eight) and assists (43). 
She ranks second in field-goal percentage (44.8%) and scoring average (12.8). 
Azusa Pacific entered the week 15-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Reggie Phillips (Ventura College) is shooting 54.8% from the field and 
is averaging 15.8 points for Cal State Bakersfield (13-2), the defending NCAA 
Division II champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Westmont guard-forward Mike Spears (Hueneme) ranks fifth in the Golden State 
Athletic Conference in field-goal percentage (57.7%) and ninth in free-throw 
percentage (77.1%). In a five-point loss to Hawaii Pacific last week, Spears 
was matched against Louisville transfer John Strickland, a prospective NAIA 
All-American. Spears scored 15 points and grabbed seven rebounds.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: FANS PUT TEAM DOWN FOR COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That wasn't a typographical error. The Alemany High boys' basketball team 
really lost, 43-13, to St. Bernard last week. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, Coach Robert Webb's players couldn't seem to understand 
patience on offense, so he forced it on them. Against St. Bernard, he required 
the players to make 10 passes before they could take a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans were counting (the passes)," Webb said. "The fans were booing us. 
That's a nice home-court advantage for you. It's not what everyone wants to 
see, but when you are dealing with what I am dealing with, you have to." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, an Alemany player stepped to the free-throw line and an 
elderly fan stood up and yelled at Webb, "You're not going to let him shoot 
that, are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Webb, who is 25 and in his first season as a head coach at any level, said his 
players now understand the need for patience and he has relaxed the mandatory 
10-pass rule, but he still wants to keep games as slow as possible for the 3-11 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may think I'm nuts, but it was working," Webb said. "We executed our 
offense. I was very happy with 12-6 at halftime against (St. Bernard). That 
half was a moral victory for us. The reality is you do what you have to do to 
stay in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who don't understand the game think I'm an idiot and some people who 
do understand basketball think I'm an idiot." TRI-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Heart, Soul, Knee 
</P>
<P>
 The Tri-Valley figured to be a two-team race between Oak Park and St. 
Bonaventure. But since the Seraphs lost their point guard to a serious knee 
injury, it has been all Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Dunst, a 6-foot senior who was a second-team all-league selection last 
season, is recovering from reconstructive surgery after suffering torn 
ligaments in his right knee while making a layup against Providence. St. 
Bonaventure (8-5) was 3-0 at that point, but the Seraphs have dropped five of 
10 since losing what Coach Marc Groff called the heart and soul of his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of those enthusiastic, fiery, competitive kids," Groff said of 
Dunst, who was averaging 10 points a game when he was injured. "We're not 
playing with the same enthusiasm now. We're just quiet kids without Scott. You 
can't coach enthusiasm. You can't make kids breathe fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to put into words the abstract things a kid gives you. They don't 
show up in statistics. But Scott was our on-floor coach." FRONTIER LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 No Fun for Sebek 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Sebek set Nordhoff's single-game scoring record this season with 40 
points against St. Bonaventure. He is the second all-time leading scorer at the 
school, and he averages 25.3 points per game. But for Sebek, basketball games 
have been about as enjoyable as midterm exams because the Rangers are 
struggling at 4-10, 0-2 in league play.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost some easy games, and some close games that we should have won 
easily," said Sebek, a senior guard. "I'm not used to losing so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Sebek said Nordhoff is switching from a man-to-man defense to a zone this 
week, in part because its players have trouble matching other teams' size and 
quickness.  
</P>
<P>
 With his shooting prowess, does Sebek feel pressure to carry Nordhoff's 
scoring load? 
</P>
<P>
 "A little pressure," he said. "I don't want to shoot as much as I am." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark has taken a "bomb's-away" approach to the season by launching 210 
three-point shots, an average of 14 per game. The Musketeers have hit 39% of 
their long shots, led by senior guard Micah Hanson, who has made 40 of 101 
(39.6%). 
</P>
<P>
 Center Jeff Barry (14-34) and forward Mike Newbill (12-29) are most successful 
from long range, each shooting 41%. Around the Leagues . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Reseda has jumped out of the gate with a record of 14-0, but the team has 
some work remaining if it expects to be considered the best in school history. 
The Regents finished with a mark of 24-1 in 1982-83 under Coach Bill Hughes and 
defeated Canoga Park in the City Section 3-A Division final, 54-41. Reseda also 
won the championship the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oak Park has four starters averaging in double figures in scoring after 15 
games: Shawn Williams (16 points), Brandon Creason (14), Ryan Garth (12.9) and 
Nick Rattray (11.6). 
</P>
<P>
 * Until last week's 49-39 loss to Santa Clara, Oak Park had a 5-0 record 
against Frontier League teams. The Eagles had beaten Calabasas, Moorpark 
(twice), Nordhoff and Santa Paula by an average of 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * El Camino Real senior Charles Adams, an All-City Section selection, leads 
the team in free-throw percentage. However, Adams made only 18 of 39 (46.2%) 
from the line entering play this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thousand Oaks forward Jason Hartman leads the Marmonte League in rebounding 
with an average of 12.4, and 6-11 center Paul Brandt leads the league in 
blocked shots (2.3). 
</P>
<P>
 * Rio Mesa forward Dorian Carson leads the Channel League in rebounding 
average (10.2). 
</P>
<P>
 * All but two of the 23 goals scored by the Sylmar boys' soccer team have been 
put in the net by someone named Cabrera. There are four Cabreras on the team: 
Gubini, Saul, Israel and Juan Carlos. The last three are brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 * St. Genevieve has moved its scheduled home games from Birmingham High 
because Coach Dan Donovan no longer wants to use the school's old gym, which is 
small and has a leaky roof. The Valiants' games are being played at various 
Valley schools such as Notre Dame and Alemany.

CAMARILLO PINS 45-21 DEFEAT ON THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Camarillo High wrestling Coach Ron Wilson might not like to hear this 
assumption, but his team has unofficially been handed the Marmonte League 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerfully efficient Scorpions routed defending league co-champion 
Thousand Oaks, 45-21, Thursday night. Last week, Camarillo thrashed Royal, the 
other defending champion, by a similar score. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll win it now," Thousand Oaks Coach Larry Mortensen said. "I don't see 
anybody standing in their way." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently not. But Wilson was not ready to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be real easy to get complacent after we've beaten the two league 
champs, but I really try to keep the kids focused," he said. "I really beat 
them down (in practice) the next day after meets and let them know it's not 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wilson was as impressed as anyone with the Scorpions' dominating 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a phenomenal turnaround for our kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crucial for Camarillo (9-1, 2-0 in league meets) was its control of the lower 
weight classes. In the opening match at 103 pounds, Scott Weisse set the tone 
with a hard-fought pin with 42 seconds left in the first overtime against 
Thousand Oaks' Thanh Tran. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first four matches, Scorpion wrestlers had registered two pins 
(Weisse and 125-pounder Rich Osler), two lopsided decisions (Ron and Rick 
Peterson at 112 and 119 pounds) and enjoyed a 19-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually we look at the lower weight classes to get some wins for us," Lancer 
assistant Emanuel Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks had some success in the middle weights. The Lancers (1-2 in 
league meets) got pins by Kirk Olivas (130 pounds) and Parry Wu (135 pounds) in 
the next two matches to pull to within 19-12, but that was as close as they 
could get. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo 140-pounder Jesse Munoz defeated flu-stricken Fred Birckhead, 11-4, 
to stretch the lead to 22-12. Birckhead was severely dehydrated after the 
match. He appeared woozy and had trouble walking for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the remaining Lancers were similarly staggered. Camarillo 
won four of the final five weight classes on three pins and a 15-point 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got good guys all the way through," Mortensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Renteria (152 pounds) pinned Lancer Jared Pace in 1 minute 13 seconds. 
Pace's brother Josh exacted a measure of retribution by pinning Scorpion Adam 
Rudd in the next match (160 pounds). 
</P>
<P>
 But after that, it was all Camarillo, in stunningly easy fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Head-shaven, thickly-muscled Darren Hatch defeated Brandon Savage, 19-4, at 
171 pounds. At 189 pounds, Travis Zurkle pinned Alex Pappas in the third period 
and in the heavyweight category, Jason Cundiffer pinned Mike Martin in only 39 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Wilson voiced surprise at the lopsided score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousand Oaks is a top team," he said. "But we've been pretty impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 That much, at least, he would admit to.

DIGEST: ELIGIBILITY APPEALS FAIL FOR 2 CHATSWORTH PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Appeals filed by two former Faith Baptist High baseball players seeking 
athletic eligibility have been denied, it was announced Thursday.

Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Strauther, a senior high schools division administrator with the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, heard appeals Wednesday and upheld the earlier 
decision.

HEY, ISN'T THAT COACH KOSHALEK?; MOCA'S DIRECTOR VISITS THE 49ERS TO RECHARGE 
HIS CREATIVE BATTERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want to know what really happened behind the scenes with the San 
Francisco 49ers late in the regular season, ask Richard Koshalek. 
</P>
<P>
 He should know. After all, he's director of Los Angeles' Museum of 
Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
 It is safe to say that the idea of consulting the mild-mannered and 
bespectacled arts executive on 49ers strategy never occurred to the 
sportswriters typing away in the press box as the team was busily losing its 
Jan. 3 game against the Philadelphia Eagles on a chilly Monday night at 
Candlestick Park. That perpetually cranky crowd, canceling out their diet Cokes 
with bags of greasy potato chips and fretting over deadlines, never knew there 
was a most unlikely football expert sitting right behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 49ers coach George Seifert had just pulled star quarterback Steve Young off 
the field and replaced him with Steve Bono, just as he had during the Christmas 
Day game against the Houston Oilers. Then, the Steve-switch had led to 
widespread press speculation that there was bad blood between coach and player. 
But "it was all decided at the beginning of the (Oilers) game, that (Seifert) 
was going to take out Young," Koshalek offered cheerfully, intently watching 
the action on a press box video monitor, bundled up in a bright red 49ers 
jacket and cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Seifert) did it for two reasons: One, he didn't want Young to be injured 
before the playoffs, and second, he wanted Bono to get some playing time before 
the end of the game," Koshalek continued. "So it was all decided. It had 
nothing to do with the score, it had nothing to do with being ahead or behind 
or anything. It was truly decided before the game that Young was coming out 
before the third quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 In an odd marriage of the non-profit arts world and gazillion-dollar 
professional sports -- made possible by a foundation grant designed to recharge 
his creative batteries -- Koshalek has become an unlikely team insider. Instead 
of spending December and early January at MOCA, attending genteel exhibition 
openings and cajoling major donations for the museum from board members and 
trustees, Koshalek was following the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 On a month-long sabbatical from the museum (he returned to work Monday), 
Koshalek received red-carpet treatment from the team. "I've done everything I 
could possibly do -- I mean, except for suiting up and going through a 
practice," he said. "I've seen the workout sessions, I've met with the coach, I 
rode the plane coming back from Detroit (for the Dec. 19 game against the Lions 
at the Silverdome), I've gone through the quarterbacking strategy, sat in on 
the post-game interviews . . . the whole thing has been quite extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the plane coming back from Detroit, I sat next to George Seifert, and he 
opened up the playbook , and (started) going through the plays. . . . The 
player's playbook, that's his life. It's absolutely fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 Koshalek has become a font of personal tidbits about the team. Seifert, whom 
Koshalek describes as extremely superstitious, is a big fan of rocker Billy 
Idol and salmon fishing. One star player -- Koshalek asked that his name not be 
revealed -- always brings dirt from the field at Candlestick Park to away games 
and rubs it into the football for luck. All players take private hotel rooms on 
the road except Steve Young and tight end Brent Jones, who room together. "Each 
player goes through his own little ritual before the game," Koshalek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koshalek's football experience is part of a 3-year-old program called the 
Avocational Adventure Grants. Sponsored by Los Angeles' Durfee Foundation and 
offered by invitation only, the grants allow senior members of non-profit 
Southern California institutions to pursue an "avocational interest." It is 
hoped that providing sabbaticals to executives at institutions with no such 
programs will encourage them to stay in their current posts rather than 
changing jobs to get some needed time off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like running away to join the circus," Koshalek, 52, said happily. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Koshalek is running away, who is running MOCA? "I have no idea. I 
have no idea what they are doing. I should call." He laughed. "But it's going 
very well. It's holiday time, so it's our quiet time." 
</P>
<P>
 Koshalek said that grantees are not required to submit a report on their 
adventure or prove its relevance to their work, but noted he had discovered 
some similarities between his job and that of the 49ers head coach. "(Seifert) 
says, 'Richard, how do you find artists whose work is of value?' I said: 'We 
have lists of people, we do our research, we talk to a lot of people, and we 
sort of come up with a final list.' And he said: 'That's the same way we draft 
football players.' " 
</P>
<P>
 An Avocational Adventure grantee is the architect of his or her own adventure. 
For Koshalek, a Wisconsin native who grew up playing high school football and 
attending college games in Madison with his father, his dream was to follow a 
professional team. He acknowledges that the 49ers were more than a little 
surprised that an arts executive knew so much about the game. Finding the 
Durfee Foundation receptive to the idea, Koshalek called a friend, downtown 
attorney Frank Rothman, who represents the National Football League, and asked 
for help in finding the right team.  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Richard's personality and I knew the personality of 49ers president 
Carmen Policy," Rothman said. "I just knew those two would meld. (Policy) is a 
very sophisticated, culturally intelligent man. I knew he would understand when 
he got a call from the director of a contemporary art museum. Others sports 
people are not so interested in contemporary art." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman did not want to pair Koshalek to the Los Angeles Raiders because "I 
thought it might be nice if . . . he got to be with a Super Bowl team. I 
thought, it's possible that that may happen for the 49ers. It wouldn't probably 
happen for the Los Angeles team." 
</P>
<P>
 Former 49er wide receiver R. C. Owens, who joined the ranks of team management 
14 years ago as executive assistant and alumni coordinator, says the team has 
never allowed a glimpse behind the scenes to "see it all, if you will. 
(Koshalek) has had a chance to be in the dressing room, hear the coach's 
pre-game speech . . . and see how the players are writhing with intensity to go 
out on the field to play and hopefully get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Policy agreed: "In some ways, what (Koshalek) did is unique. You have to have 
the right individual who does not represent a distraction, who is not 
threatening, in a sense, to really let the barriers down. We were permitting 
him to come into the inner sanctum." 
</P>
<P>
 Policy acknowledged he was shocked to see Seifert open up the playbook for 
Koshalek. And he praised the museum director for avoiding a common tendency to 
stereotype athletes and coaches as dumb. "Here is Richard, carrying on this 
football conversation with George Seifert, and they'll lapse into a 
conversation about art," he said. "It was quite intriguing." 
</P>
<P>
 Policy said he has paid a visit to MOCA. "I was there for the John Cage 
exhibit, and I was really impressed with the way the gallery ran -- even though 
I was not impressed with some of their, er, terribly valuable pieces," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Koshalek said he was indeed impressed by the intelligence of team 
members, he was also struck (no pun intended) by the impact of bodies against 
bodies. "It's a high decibel event," he said. "On the field, it's totally 
different from up here (in the press box), totally different from watching it 
on television. You magnify it 100 times -- the impact, the hits, the total 
effort that goes into it." Koshalek pulled a small, pale-green packet of 
smelling salts from his pocket. "On the bench, there's a lot of this going on," 
he said, waving it under his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Koshalek was fascinated to watch the linebackers soberly taping their pads to 
their bodies with double-face tape before the game to make sure their shirts 
will fit skin-tight. "The concentration and concern that's on their faces -- 
sometimes I said: 'That looks like fear,' " Koshalek said. "And one of the guys 
said: 'Damn right it's fear!' 
</P>
<P>
 While offering a standing invitation for the 49ers to come to MOCA, Koshalek 
said he has no plans to tap into football money in the museum's perpetual 
search for board members and donors. "This was just for me," he said.

DOMINGO COMES HOME TO 'EL GATO'; MUSIC: THE TENOR IS RETURNING TO HIS ROOTS IN 
THE MUSICAL-THEATER IDIOM KNOWN AS ZARZUELA. BOTH HIS PARENTS SANG THE SPANISH 
OPERAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Placido Domingo makes his triumphant entrance in "El Gato Montes" (The 
Wildcat) at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Saturday, the moment 
will represent a homecoming for the Spanish tenor both onstage and off. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Costa Mesa performance, and in five of six subsequent performances at 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion beginning Wednesday, Domingo is returning to his 
roots in the Hispanic musical-theater idiom known as zarzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother and my father met singing zarzuelas," he explained during a break 
in "Gato" rehearsals earlier this week. "My mother used to declare her love to 
my father every night in the work and, after three months, my father said that 
he'd heard it so much that he accepted it. So they got married." 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Domingo said, "the world of zarzuela was so important and so big 
in Spain that when my mother was offered the possibility of becoming an 
(operatic) soprano -- singing Tosca and other dramatic repertory in Barcelona 
-- she couldn't go and do it. My father was also a voice lost to the world of 
opera. They wanted him to be a Wagnerian tenor, but because of his commitment 
to this wonderful (zarzuela) music, he was not able." 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo, who turns 53 next Friday, said that his mother was singing zarzuelas 
while pregnant with him, so he heard the music even before his birth. He grew 
up backstage, helping out by doing everything from setting up the sheet music 
for the orchestra to singing child roles. He also conducted the backstage 
chorus and eventually made his debut as a zarzuela baritone (he subsequently 
made his operatic debut in 1961). 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, however, his family was living in Mexico and, in his words, "the 
golden age for the zarzuela had passed. There were more possibilities for opera 
in Spain then and I was very much tempted. But at the beginning, it seemed like 
I would follow the same steps as my parents: singing zarzuelas all my life and 
probably not becoming as well known." 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo has long included zarzuela arias in his concerts and, at the end of 
1991, recorded "El Gato Montes" for Deutsche Grammophon. The following year 
found him singing "Gato" in Seville at Expo, the world's fair, in a staging by 
Emilio Sagi that was subsequently seen in Madrid, Japan and now reaches 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented in Costa Mesa under the auspices of Opera Pacific, it will be a Los 
Angeles Music Center Opera production at the Pavilion, and Domingo is proud 
that it will be the first Spanish-language work in the Music Center Opera's 
history. Justino Diaz and Veronica Villarroel are featured along with Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo's enthusiasm for the project can be partly explained in terms of 
national pride and nostalgia for his youth. "There are very few Spanish 
operas," he said, "and I would like the public to know them. As much as I can 
present Spanish music around the world, I will do it." He also mentioned "the 
great Spanish community around (Southern California)" and the prospect of 
"bringing a new generation to the opera." 
</P>
<P>
 However, in a year when Domingo is singing everything from Offenbach in Vienna 
to Wagner in Milan, his commitment to "Gato," a comparatively little-known 1916 
music-drama by Manuel Penella largely stems from the high quality he finds in 
the work itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first act, for me, is perfect," he said. "You can compare it to any first 
act of any grand opera. It has inspired music, a beautiful atmosphere. It has a 
comic scene for the priest, then the drama gets deeper and there are beautiful 
duets for the soprano and the tenor, plus a wonderful scene for the baritone. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel a lot of Puccini in it," he said. "You really have to compare it to 
the verismo works: It requires that you do a lot of acting. But the music is so 
beautiful by itself that if you could hear the first act only in a concert 
version, you would still be thrilled by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone familiar with Bizet's "Carmen" would also be intrigued by a number of 
similarities -- the central rivalry, for example, between a bandit and a 
bullfighter for the love of a Gypsy. There's also a dramatic prophecy of doom, 
a climactic scene outside a bull ring and constant infusions of local color. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Sagi acknowledged that "we are in the same place and with the same 
background (as "Carmen"). We are neighbors. But the characters are completely 
different." So is the deployment of vocal resources. In "Carmen," of course, 
Domingo always sings the obsessed outlaw/lover. But in "Gato," that role goes 
to the baritone while Domingo gets to play the bullfighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Domingo, Sagi comes from a zarzuela family: "My grandfather was a very 
famous singer," he said, "and my uncle has sung with the mother of Placido 
Domingo." Since 1990, Sagi has been director of Teatro Lirico Nacional La 
Zarzuela in Madrid, an institution that he believes has been instrumental in 
upgrading the status of the genre both in Spain and internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Before "Gato," he directed Domingo in Puccini's "La Fanciulla del West" in 
Madrid, finding the tenor "a big pleasure to work with because he always 
listens to you, and is very eager to do all the things you want on the stage." 
</P>
<P>
 To Sagi, the greatest difficulties in staging "El Gato Montes" involve 
conveying the atmosphere of Andalusia and also "finding a balance between the 
real and the non-real," specifically the naturalism of the early scenes versus 
the stylization demanded later on. "You can't show the public in a naturalistic 
way all the things that Penella asks you (in the final scenes)," he said. "You 
must try to catch very strong images to be as powerful as the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish-speaking opera enthusiasts will notice that the Andalusian atmosphere 
is expressed partly through language -- the distinctive elisions and shifts in 
pronunciation of that region -- along with what Domingo calls "the turns in the 
voice that come from the flamenco, and that reveal a Moorish influence." Like 
Sagi, he is concerned with the difference between the early scenes of the work 
and the ending. "I would have developed the last act a different way," he said. 
"I would have made it a little more important, a little longer. But in many 
zarzuelas, the first act is strong and then perhaps it grows weaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe maestro Penella didn't have enough for the ending and just cut it 
short. But I think there is enough there for the public to really understand 
the work and to appreciate the color of Spain and Andalusia in it, and the 
feeling of the bull ring." 
</P>
<P>
 For the final performance, on Jan. 29, Domingo is scheduled to be replaced by 
zarzuela specialist Antonio Ordonez. Originally, Domingo explained, he was due 
in Japan for yet another "Three Tenors" concert with Luciano Pavarotti and Jose 
Carreras at the end of the month. And even after that event was switched to Los 
Angeles in July, he felt it "a good policy" to engage a major artist as a cover 
here -- and to give that artist a performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we're doing 'Tosca,' or 'Carmen,' " he said, "where a tenor who 
knows the part can fly here in three hours to substitute for somebody who is 
sick. If I catch a cold, there are seven performances and, obviously, nobody 
knows the part." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line on Ordonez from Domingo, who serves as ongoing artistic 
consultant to the L.A. Opera and its occasional conductor as well as periodic 
star tenor: "He's a wonderful singer so I think the public will be very, very 
happy."

 Streisand Funds Kelley Memorial: Barbra Streisand will memorialize "the spirit 
and optimism with which Virginia Clinton Kelley fought the breast cancer that 
took her life" with $200,000 in seed money to create the Virginia Clinton 
Kelley Breast Cancer Research and Education Fund at the Arkansas Cancer 
Research Center, part of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. 
Kelley, the mother of President Clinton, died in her sleep Jan. 6. According to 
the university, she spent her last weekend in Las Vegas attending Streisand's 
concerts there, and was informed of Streisand's contributions and plans for the 
fund prior to her death. And Streisand reportedly spoke to Kelley just before 
she went to sleep on the night she died. Said Streisand: "I am deeply saddened 
by her passing, but she died as she lived, with grace and dignity, full of 
enthusiasm and the joy of life. . . . (She) leaves her optimism, tenacity and 
compassion as a legacy to her son, to the nation and to all of us privileged to 
have known her." President Clinton has requested that memorial gifts in his 
mother's name be made to the new fund.

 'Tales' Rates With Viewers: Armistead Maupin's three-night "Tales of the City" 
-- the controversial six-hour PBS miniseries about the lives and loves of a 
diverse cast of 1970s San Franciscans -- carried an estimated 7% of the 
national viewing audience, according to early Nielsen ratings. The ratings were 
double what PBS usually gets in prime time but would be considered low for a 
commercial network. In Los Angeles, "Tales," based on Maupin's international 
best-selling novel derived from his long-running San Francisco Chronicle 
column, drew between 250,320 and 290,371 homes each night, ranging from 7% to 
9% of the viewing audience. San Francisco's numbers were much higher, drawing 
21% to 28% of viewers -- topping all four networks on Monday and Wednesday and 
trailing only ABC on Tuesday.

CBS' STRINGER EASES STANCE OVER LOSS OF NFL GAMES; TELEVISION: CONCERNED ABOUT 
REPORTS HE WOULD PUNISH FOX, HE SAYS HIS ANGRY COMMENTS WERE INTENDED TO SERVE 
AS INSPIRATION FOR A NETWORK ACCUSED OF COMPLACENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Howard Stringer, CBS Broadcast Group president, sought Thursday to defuse 
reports running through the television industry that he is angry and intends to 
punish the Fox network for luring away CBS' professional football franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, his harsh comments at an affiliates meeting in Carlsbad Monday were 
intended to be a motivational speech, he told a meeting of TV critics in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got riled up down there because I wanted to use what had happened as a kind 
of notice on the bulletin board -- to my own staff and the affiliates -- that 
16 Sundays does not a season make," Stringer said. "When Fox executives called 
us complacent, I just wanted to banish all sense of complacency and use it as 
an opportunity to make us aggressive and competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he said, he didn't want to let CBS affiliates feel sorry for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringer said that if CBS had matched Fox's purchase price of $1.58 billion 
for four-year broadcast rights to the NFL's National Conference games, the 
network would have lost $160 million to $200 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "How Fox will shift its offshore billions, I don't know," Stringer joked. 
"That's hard for me to judge, and I wish them well." 
</P>
<P>
 Stringer has no beef with Fox, he said, he's just upset over losing the 
personal relationships with longtime CBS personnel such as announcers Pat 
Summerall, John Madden and Terry Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "That made me mad -- that's true," he said. "I'm not angry at Fox. They simply 
did to us what we, in effect, did to NBC on baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, CBS must come up with some programming to fill Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS intends to return 90 minutes of what is now the football block to its 
affiliated stations, which they can fill with local or syndicated programming. 
As for the rest, "Loss is an opportunity," Stringer said. He already has been 
pitched everything to fill the slot "from Martha Stewart, to interactive, to 
bizarre sports -- which we won't be doing -- to family movies, to multiplex 
programming." 
</P>
<P>
 He did not rule out the idea of getting involved in developing a new 
professional football league, but said it would be very complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringer maintained that CBS will retain its position as the No. 1 network 
this season, even though ABC is close behind, based on the strength of the 
Winter Olympics in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Olympics, given the Nancy Kerrigan situation . . . is going to be a 
fantastic Olympics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a separate meeting with the TV critics Wednesday night, Jeff Sagansky, CBS 
Entertainment president, firmly stated that the broadcast networks have no 
intention of yielding to congressional pressure to develop a voluntary ratings 
system to address TV violence. Last week, representatives from the cable-TV 
industry agreed in principle to such a system and to establish an outside 
monitor for violent content. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we need a ratings system," said Sagansky, who added that CBS 
instead is working hard to minimize necessary violence in its programs and to 
reduce the overall level of violence. He said that seven of the 10 
highest-rated movies this season aired on CBS, and none of them was based on a 
true-crime story. "We don't rely on feature films and the harder-action and 
harder-edge shows that cable does. We're in a different business. We're 
broadcasters." 
</P>
<P>
 Stringer suggested that it's about time the rest of the TV industry step up: 
"For whatever role we play in violence, we have done our part. Now go out and 
worry about syndicators for a while, the cable industry for a while, all the 
people who are ducking under the general blanket indictment of network 
television -- which in Washington passes for all television." 
</P>
<P>
 Stringer said he would like to see a more sophisticated discussion on violence 
in America, which is one reason why he commissioned a three-hour prime-time 
documentary on the subject for later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In other programming news, Sagansky said that Tom Arnold's new series, "Tom," 
will debut after the Winter Olympics on Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m., now the home 
of "Hearts Afire," the John Ritter-Markie Post sitcom, which will be given a 
shot at reviving its sagging ratings by moving in April to Mondays at 9:30 
p.m., after "Murphy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky announced several new prime-time projects in development at CBS, most 
notably a live dramatic broadcast in the spirit of "Playhouse 90." Francis Ford 
Coppola will direct "Top of the Ninth," about a major-league baseball pitcher 
at the crossroads of his life, in an actual baseball stadium sometime in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Producers working on drama series candidates for CBS are "Picket Fences" 
creator David E. Kelley, "Northern Exposure" creators Joshua Brand and John 
Falsey, "Law & Order" creator Dick Wolf, "China Beach" co-creator John Sacret 
Young and "Magnum, P.I." creator Don Bellasario, who will return to Hawaii for 
his project. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy development at the network includes a series starring Cybill Shepherd 
as a downwardly mobile woman, Dolly Parton as a TV cooking show host and a 
project from Rob Reiner about bedtime stories come to life. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about Rush Limbaugh in prime time? Eric Ober, CBS news president, 
confirmed Wednesday that negotiations are underway with the conservative media 
star to provide regular commentary on a new newsmagazine this spring. Ober 
assured TV critics that there would also be a liberal viewpoint presented. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe in fairness and accuracy and balanced presentation," Ober said, 
"and we have always tried to balance out commentary positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he might put on Limbaugh-nemesis Howard Stern as a counterpoint, Ober 
said: "I've never considered putting Howard Stern on the air for any reason."

HOME TECH / LASER BIN: PLAYBOY ENTERS THE INTERACTIVE ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've started taking your first baby steps down that highly touted 
information superhighway, you may bump into some familiar figures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And depending on your viewpoint, you may be salivating, or cursing. 
</P>
<P>
 Playboy, which plunged into the market early in the game via a pay-TV channel, 
audio and video tapes and CDs, has jumped into the laser disc video revolution 
with both feet, and most other body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The empire, founded by a man whose wardrobe was defined by silk pajamas, is 
now presided over by his daughter, who has found even more imaginative ways to 
bring all those provocative -- some would say licentious -- images in the 
vaults into the '90s realm of laser discs, CD-ROMs and other interactive 
formats. 
</P>
<P>
 If you thought the Philips CD-1 was a machine designed just to teach your kids 
how to spell and count, think again. "Playboy's Complete Massage" ($25), made 
exclusively for the interactive Philips CD-I Digital Video, provocatively 
promises to draw "upon the therapeutic and sensual expertise of the masters, 
unites timeless techniques with new age technology for a truly erotic 
experience." The CD-I program promises to "inspire you to explore and enjoy new 
sexual possibilities by arousing your intimacy and heightening your ecstasy." 
You might want to put the kids to bed first. 
</P>
<P>
 The less tactile "Playboy Electronic Datebook" ($40) includes 50 nude or 
partially clothed "girls" from the 1950s to the 1990s. A click-and-drag formula 
lets you organize your meetings, vacations and appointments around your 
favorite Playmates: that famous Marilyn Monroe nude calendar photo, or others 
named Debra Jo, Candy, Erika, Jessica or . . . LaToya. 
</P>
<P>
 Playboy Video offers laser discs featuring everything from the Playmate of the 
Month to the documentary on Playboy founder and editor, "Hugh Hefner: Once Upon 
a Time" ($20), put together by "Twin Peaks" producers David Lynch and Mark 
Frost. The film, released to theaters before its video release, includes home 
movies of Hefner as a kid, glimpses into the Playboy Mansion, hokey clips of 
Hefner's first TV appearances and interview statements from close and 
not-so-close friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Playboy's "Inside Video" series (around $35) offers ribald tales. Playboy 
calls them "unusual sexy tales of haunting passion and obsession, of intrigue, 
sensuality and eroticism." Others might characterize them as boring soft porn. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems every time technology moves forward, adult entertainment gets in line 
first. The laser revolution is no exception. These electronic adult titles are 
just the beginning. Penthouse already is providing raunchier offerings. And 
various computer software companies are producing such best-selling titles as 
"Virtual Valerie" with contents impossible to accurately describe in a family 
newspaper. Not to mention video games well-bashed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the technology, though, the viewing and purchase pattern may 
well stay the same: Men will rush out to buy new toys (laser disc and CD-ROM 
players) to savor age-old fantasies, then justify the purchase by buying 
educational programs for children and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Playboy even hooked up with IBM to create one product that could prove to be 
illuminating for the entire family. It's a new CD-ROM called "The Playboy 
Interview, 1962-1992" ($70). When Miles Davis appeared as the first "Playboy 
Interview" in 1962, Playboy says that the idea of storing entertainment on a 
spinning disc was something out of an H.G. Wells novel. But now, 32 years 
later, we get not only the full text from interviews with 352 personalities 
ranging from Malcolm X to Martin Luther King Jr., from Orson Welles to Woody 
Allen, but also 1,000 photos, video clips from a 30th-anniversary party, a 
tutorial and library. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we are in gear for the 21st Century.

JAZZ NOTES: NEA HONORS BELLSON, JAMAL AND MCRAE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louie Bellson's lithe, precise explosions from the drum set, the deft touch 
and just-so note placement of pianist Ahmad Jamal, the liquid luxury of Carmen 
McRae's contralto -- these three distinctive sounds from the jazz world have 
moved audiences for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bellson, Jamal and McRae are being honored for their lengthy 
contributions to music and American culture by being selected for the 1994 
American Jazz Master Fellowships, the lifetime achievement awards presented by 
the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The artists, who join such past recipients as Dizzy Gillespie, Ella 
Fitzgerald, Sonny Rollins and Art Blakey, will be honored tonight at a ceremony 
in Boston. NEA Chair Jane Alexander will present the one-time-only fellowships 
of $20,000 each to Bellson, Jamal and McRae. 
</P>
<P>
 "These colossal talents have helped write the history of jazz in America," 
said Alexander recently in announcing the awards. "They have distinguished 
themselves as musicians, composers and teachers, blending their unique style 
with a commitment to preserving and passing on a musical tradition that is 
proudly American." 
</P>
<P>
 The awards ceremony will be part of the annual meeting of the International 
Assn. of Jazz Educators. The Billy Taylor Trio, Sheila Jordan and Joe 
Henderson's quartet are the featured performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellson is regarded as one of the finest drummers to come out of the swing 
era. He worked with Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey and Duke Ellington, has led his 
own bands and has written numerous compositions, including the classic "Skin 
Deep" and his recent magnum opus, "Tomus." 
</P>
<P>
 McRae, who worked as a soloist from the mid-'50s until the late '80s, when a 
recurring bronchial ailment forced her retirement, is acclaimed for being one 
of the most distinctive of jazz vocalists, a singer who can make even the most 
innocuous material come alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal, who has spent most of his four-decade career as leader of his own trio, 
has proven to be one of the most influential pianists in jazz, leaving his mark 
on such artists as Miles Davis and current sensation Benny Green. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a thrill to be selected," says Bellson, who lives in the San 
Fernando Valley. "I think of when I was a kid, picking up records by Duke (and) 
Basie hoping I'd have a chance to meet them. And then to play with them, and 
then get this award, well, I have to pinch myself. I'm so glad to have been in 
that era of music where they were all heavyweights. There are beautiful things 
happening today, but that was a golden era." 
</P>
<P>
 Avant Guardian: Anyone who watched tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders on the 
bandstand with John Coltrane's quintet in the mid-'60s will probably never 
forget him. Sanders would bend backward and blow streams of notes, or issue 
wild shrieks through his instrument that sounded like an elephant set to 
charge. These notes were often followed by deep, soothing tones. His 
performances exemplified an era when experimentation was at its zenith, and 
Sanders was one of the most notable members of jazz's avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a wonderful period with a lot of energy," Sanders says of jazz's 
mid-to-late '60s. "Nobody ever told me that I had to play this way or that way. 
I just did it any way I wanted to do it. We started when we started, ended when 
we ended." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, whose career is on an upswing after some inactivity during the '80s, 
has relaxed somewhat, but don't expect him to completely turn his back on his 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to be an all-around musician, play everything," says the 53-year-old 
artist, who leads a quartet at Catalina Bar & Grill beginning Tuesday for a 
six-night stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders said his current performances mix lyrical originals with pop and jazz 
standards but he adds that he still favors lengthy renditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you play long, rather than short solos, you will get into something," he 
says. "And I like the rhythm section players to play long, too. I want them to 
motivate me, so that I can jump in there and play some more. I don't want to 
just end it." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing with Sanders at Catalina will be pianist William Henderson, bassist 
Jeff Littleton and drummer Ralph Penland. 
</P>
<P>
 Critic's Choice Ravi Coltrane, the great saxophonist's son, will be showcased 
when drummer Gerry Gibbs -- son of the noted vibist Terry Gibbs -- plays a pair 
of three-night stands at the Club Brasserie. The N.Y.C.-based Gibbs will employ 
pianist Billy Childs Thursday through Jan. 22, and pianist Patrice Rushen, Jan. 
27-29. Bass ace Andy Simpkins will be on hand for all six nights. . . . Pianist 
Benny Green makes a brief solo appearance Saturday from 2 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. at 
the Virgin Megastore, 8000 Sunset Blvd., in Hollywood. Information: (213) 
650-8666.

'BANQUET,' 'RUBY' LEAD '93 SPIRIT NOMINEES; MOVIES: BOTH WIN SPOTS IN THE BEST 
FEATURE AND FIVE OTHER CATEGORIES IN THE 'ALTERNATIVE OSCARS' FOR INDEPENDENT 
FILMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With six nods each, "Ruby in Paradise" and "The Wedding Banquet" lead with the 
most nominations for the 1993 Independent Spirit Awards -- frequently dubbed 
"the alternative Oscars." 
</P>
<P>
 They are among the five nominees for best feature film -- the others are 
"Equinox," "Much Ado About Nothing" and "Short Cuts." To qualify, movies must 
be produced with financing from outside the Hollywood studios. 
</P>
<P>
 In the category of best feature film by a first-time director is "American 
Heart," which had four other nominations, including best actor to Jeff Bridges, 
who portrays an ex-con. Other first feature nominees are "Combination Platter," 
"El Mariachi," "Mac" and "Menace II Society." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of this year's nominations -- made by a committee of the 
governing body, the Independent Features Project West -- was postponed from 
earlier this week due to a controversy over the eligibility of Gramercy 
Pictures' drama "A Dangerous Woman," starring Debra Winger. The IFPW board 
determined that the film, which initially had received two nominations, had 
been partially funded by Universal Pictures and thus was not eligible, 
according to IFPW President Cathy Main. Gramercy is jointly owned by Universal 
Pictures and Polygram. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Gramercy President Russell Schwartz said the IFPW's rules "make 
no sense. They are as archaic as the (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences') foreign language rules." Schwartz said that Universal's only 
involvement was to guarantee a bank loan to the filmmaker. Its money was not 
used, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spirit Awards show, which will be held (but not televised) on March 19 at 
the Hollywood Palladium, is intentionally more offbeat and informal than the 
black-tie Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Oscar show, which 
follows two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 The nominations for best feature film are: 
</P>
<P>
 "Equinox," from I.R.S. Media. The film noir fairy tale about good and evil 
twins stars best actor nominee Matthew Modine. Director Alan Rudolph was not 
nominated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much Ado About Nothing," from the Samuel Goldwyn Co., is director Kenneth 
Branagh's adaptation of the Shakespeare comedy, although he was not nominated 
for best director. The film also brought a best actress nomination for Emma 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruby in Paradise," from October Films, earned six nominations including two 
for Victor Nunez for direction and screenplay and for Ashley Judd as best 
actress for her portrayal of a woman who leaves her rough life in the mountains 
of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short Cuts," a weaving of stories about 22 people in Los Angeles, is from 
Fine Line Features. It was also nominated for Robert Altman's direction and for 
his screenplay, co-written with Frank Barhydt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wedding Banquet," from the Samuel Goldwyn Co., received six nominations, 
including nods for director Ang Lee and actors Mitchell Lichtenstein and May 
Chin. The comedy, set in New York's Chinese American community, is about a 
refugee who needs a green card and a man who feels the need to hide his 
homosexuality from his Old World parents.

THEATER BEAT: 'TINA MARIE' HAS SOME GROWING UP TO DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You won't mistake Tina Marie for Norma Desmond. Nor will you confuse "Happy 
Birthday Tina Marie" with "Sunset Boulevard." Although both are forgotten film 
stars, Tina is living proof of Norma's famous comment: "I'm still big. It's the 
pictures that got small." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Odyssey, Craig Thornton's black comedy boasts an impressive cast, 
anchored by Rhonda Aldrich's intolerably self-indulgent Tina. On the former 
teen idol's 36th birthday, Tina mourns her hit pictures, such as "College Co-Ed 
Massacre." "I am holding my breath," Tina screams at her guests, "until I get 
to play a battered wife!" 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton aspires to playwright Joe Orton's level of farce. Tina's mother (a 
strong but bafflingly conceived Sandy Martin) is murdered with a pogo stick, 
then stuffed into a closet, only to tumble out like the corpse in Orton's 
"Loot." Resembling a twin to Orton's outrageous hustlers, Tina fondles Barbie 
dolls and uses male prostitutes as if they're sexual toys. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orton insisted that motivation must remain strictly in character. Here, 
characters emerge without much logic, then exit when it's convenient for the 
playwright. The sudden arrival of Tina's welfare-cheat mother from Ohio is 
absurd. When Tina's agent (an amusing Ron Litman) and manager (a droll and 
shrewdly underplayed Sheila Traviss) fall prey to her mother's obvious 
manipulation, we've left Tinseltown and arrived in Never-Never Land. The 
amusing antics of another fallen child star, Skippy (a delicious Chuck LaFont), 
get eclipsed by his ridiculous rape of the preposterous callboy (Adam Biesk). 
</P>
<P>
 There are flashes of brilliance and wit in both the writing and acting, but 
director Gretchen Somerfeld would be wise to order revisions. "Happy Birthday 
Tina Marie" needs development through a workshop before it's ready for a 
close-up. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Happy Birthday Tina Marie," Odyssey Theatre, 2056 Sepulveda Blvd., West 
L.A. Wednesdays-Thursdays, 8 p.m., Sunday matinees, 4 p.m. Ends Feb . 6. $13. 
(310) 477-2055. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. 'Bomb' Visits Future 
Decimated by AIDS 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Bomb" bombs so utterly that you wish it could be dismissed without 
further comment. Alas, Open Fist Theatre's producers claim this is the first 
play about AIDS by a woman with AIDS. Former television scriptwriter Roxy 
Ventola began writing "After the Bomb" some eight months after losing her 
husband and 2-year-old daughter to the disease. Although it's painfully obvious 
this is Ventola's first play, Connie Chung screened rehearsals for the 
television program "Eye to Eye." 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Bomb" is set in the 21st Century. An emcee announces that the 
plague decimated entire countries. Fragments of plays have been discovered in 
the ruins of a former capital called Washington. These were created by AIDS 
carriers interned in camps. Now, a formally dressed pianist and flutist offer 
saccharine musical accompaniment to the fragments by "terminal internees." 
</P>
<P>
 The focus is muddled, even when a so-called Black Widow explains how she's 
deliberately infecting government leaders (including the United States 
President) in order to force the rich and powerful to fund a cure. (Playwright 
Michael Kearns brilliantly conceived a similar crusader in last year's "off.") 
The most memorable character (and performance, by Marc Sandler), is a doctor 
christened "Hero" wearing a cloak made from the AIDS quilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Ziad H. Hamzeh orchestrates the 28-character sketches as if they were 
a futurist "Marat-Sade." Bedlam rules pieces with titles such as "Fever." The 
company, dressed in hospital gowns, forms an ensemble evoking memories of '60s 
Theatre of Cruelty experiments. Unfortunately, the underlying sentimentality 
and overwhelming self-indulgence cancel out the aesthetic ambition. "Bomb" 
resembles an after-school television special by Antonin Artaud, or a Sunday 
School church pageant by "Star Trek" fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
 * "After the Bomb," Open Fist Theatre, 1625 N. La Brea Ave . , Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., indefinitely. $15. (213) 882-6912. Running time: 2 
hours, 15 minutes. 'Crucible' Revival Is Up to the Test 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It can be a pleasure to see a well-made play well-done, and Company of Angels 
interprets contemporary American classics as well as any theater in Southern 
California. Its current revival of Arthur Miller's "The Crucible" is crisply 
staged, reverently performed and faithful to the playwright's text. Miller's 
occasionally long-winded sermon on Salem's witch trials still stumbles toward 
the end; the last act struggle of conscience by John Proctor (a stiff Glen 
Lutz) rarely works. But in our age of politically correct thinking, the play's 
relevance survives. 
</P>
<P>
 Director James F. Engelhardt wisely restricts the pace of his large cast, 
maintaining a sense of stately order within the narrow stage. Designer Kenneth 
R. Klimak's simple set of wooden beams and planks poetically evokes the 
wilderness frontier just beyond Salem's borders in 1692. Standout performers 
include Maeve Odum as the confused servant girl Mary Warren and Ted Laufer as 
the well-meaning minister torn between dogma and humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Crucible," Company of Angels, 2106 Hyperion Ave., Silver Lake. 
Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 4 p.m. Ends Feb . 27. $12-$15. (213) 
466-1767. Running time: 2 hours, 50 minutes. 'Aces Wild' Filled With 
Contradictions 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Diana Shapiro's "Aces Wild" at Theatre Geo is a contrived, improbable 
melodrama about a career woman (Barbara Whinnery) coming to terms with 
childhood abuse. It's politically correct, socially responsible and 
well-intended while abusing the audience with stereotypes, cliches and hokum. 
</P>
<P>
 The plodding narrative depends on a gimmick that belongs to B-horror films. 
Shortly after her boyfriend (Brian Patrick Clarke) proposes marriage, 
Whinnery's Kate hears a knock at the door. It's a street urchin calling herself 
"Ace" (an over-the-top Shapiro), who at 3 a.m. has come to rent a room. There 
is no room for rent, declares the baffled Kate, but proceeds to offer the total 
stranger -- an obvious runaway from abusive parents -- space on her sofa and in 
her heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The first act meanders clumsily and obviously toward the anticipated 
realization; the second act strains to manufacture a therapeutic breakthrough 
for Kate. Yes, she forgives and heals the child within herself, but at what 
cost to dramatic truth? 
</P>
<P>
 * "Aces Wild," Theatre Geo, 1229 N. Highland Ave., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Feb. 27. $12-$15. (213) 
466-1767. Running time: 2 hours. 'Heart' Pays Homage to Welsh, Irish Poetry 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Secrets of the Celtic Heart" is "directed, concocted and distilled" by Brian 
Mallon, which is a refreshingly unpretentious claim for Mallon's labor of love. 
At Largo, his homage to 3,000 years of Welsh and Irish poetry is impeccably 
realized. Mallon wanders into the bar carrying a battered trunk, then occupies 
a candle-lit nook piled with old books. Without comment, he begins reciting 
lush, alliterative language. His selections range from 5th-Century B.C. Druid 
speeches and medieval Gaelic songs to Dylan Thomas poems. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallon resembles the pre-fame Richard Burton reciting in pubs. His lyrical 
voice possesses a clarity that translates even an opaque Gerard Manley Hopkins 
poem into vivid enchantment. "Secrets of the Celtic Heart" may not appeal to 
the majority, but those who relish the sound of language beautifully spoken can 
conjure intoxicating visions out of the Celtic twilight. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Secrets of the Celtic Heart," Largo, 432 N. Fairfax Ave., Los Angeles. 
Tuesdays, 7:30 p.m. Ends Jan. 25. $5. (213) 852-1073; (213) 852-1851. Running 
time: 1 hour, 20 minutes.

THEATER REVIEW; LARGER VENUE, SAME 'CRAZY TUNES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Steve Allen used to read rock lyrics aloud, for comic effect, you could 
get the impression that the popular songs of previous generations were so much 
more sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It ain't necessarily so. Take a gander at "Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes," a 
lighthearted, lightheaded revue of novelty songs from the '20s, '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll hear "Lookie, lookie, lookie/They call me Cookie" in this wacky 
songfest, now at the 500-seat Westwood Playhouse after a long run at 
sub-100-seat theaters in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, "Crazy Words" revives preposterous little ditties that snap, 
crackle and pop. These moments make you long for the days of vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are other songs that couldn't be redeemed by all the comic 
exertions in the world -- so this is why vaudeville died. Fortunately, the show 
flits through dozens of songs, so the real stinkers don't linger long. 
</P>
<P>
 The program for the show might have been a valuable reference tool (as was the 
program for a revue of more substantial songs, "Broadway Sings Out," from the 
same producer). Unfortunately, this one doesn't even include song titles, let 
alone other information. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the narration, written by the show's creators Milt Larsen and Gene 
Casey, provides slim glimpses of the context of some of these songs. It's 
spooned out in easygoing doses by crusty-voiced Mary Gillis, whose eyes suggest 
she's on the verge of a wisecrack even when she's not. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't a show for anyone who's especially sensitive to ethnic stereotypes. 
But at least narrator Gillis points out that the songwriters didn't always know 
what they were writing about. With most of these ethnic songs, the breezy 
format encourages laughs at the expense of the songwriters, not at the groups 
being stereotyped. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the show veers away from any conspicuously blue material. 
This show is crazy, but it isn't Dr. Demento. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Henry Ford Apologized to Me" -- composed after the auto tycoon said he 
was sorry for some anti-Semitic slurs, and sung in a heavy Yiddish accent -- 
makes a satirical point. Harold Rome's "Nobody Makes a Pass at Me" takes a dig 
at Madison Avenue overkill. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, this is an evening for just being silly. A cast of four is actively 
accompanied by pianist Dale Phillips -- appropriately enough, at an upright, 
not a grand. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Pamela Hall is also in the cast, but she lets the others have the 
show's best moments. Hall's small, sweet voice doesn't carry well in the more 
ramshackle numbers. Her all-black, short-skirted outfit, though garnished with 
color on several occasions, is too severe and restrained (the otherwise 
unidentified Diane Ross gets costume credit). 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis throws herself into her solos with no inhibitions intact. She sings "To 
Hear Veronica Play Her Harmonica on the Pier in Santa Monica" with red boa 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Pedersen swaggers with flair in "I Never Knew Our Romance Had Ended 
Until You Poisoned My Food," and he also dishes the dirt with the proper relish 
in "Don't Bring Lulu." In another number, he gets to wear googly glasses -- 
perhaps a first for the Westwood Playhouse? 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Leviton's first solo is an overdone caricature of a Gypsy violinist, but 
he recovers in time to provide many of the show's best goofy faces and sound 
effects -- note his lip-syncing in the imperishable "One Meatball." His singing 
voice carries better than anyone else's, and his comic timing enriches his 
spoken gags. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Woodward's set fits well into the spirit of the evening -- glittery but 
cheap, tacky but bright.

ART REVIEW; TWO MASTERS SEE PURITY FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Goode and John McCracken each have small solo shows at the L.A. Louver 
Gallery. The two L.A. masters make art that looks abstract to the eye. The mind 
sees other things. Both artists contemplate the idea of purity. 
</P>
<P>
 Purity is supposed to be about the absence of complexity. Few things appear 
simpler than McCracken's sculpture. He still makes rectilinear solids. There 
are 10 of them this time. Each hangs horizontally on the wall about chin high, 
vaguely resembling a shelf. But they are too thick and too shallow to store 
things, so what are they doing there? They seem very solid and strong, almost 
extruded from the wall like the ends of heavy beams hidden behind the dry wall. 
Maybe they're holding up the building. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is something else. Each work is painted one color, polished to such 
a smooth sheen that it picks up reflections from the surroundings. Depending on 
the hue, light softens the edges and surfaces of pieces differently. The black 
"Multiplex" appears hollow in the center. The red "Starlight" seems to have no 
top. Does the blue "Horizon" glow from within? They appear to float, as if 
levitated. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its Gregorian starkness, McCracken's sculpture seems to entertain the 
notion that it is impossible to make anything so plain-spoken that it does not, 
in the end, evoke its opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 Goode dwells on the notion of purity defiled. Four "Pollution Paintings" at 
L.A. Louver set a theme that is also carried on in a series of some 30 tiny 
collages on view across the street at Bobbie Greenfield Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 These days everybody is terrified of impurity. Lungs are attacked by smoke and 
fumes. Viruses gnaw at immune systems. Politicians are on the take. 
</P>
<P>
 Goode makes clear he is thinking of environmental pollution in titles like 
"Bangkok" and "Bucharest." What he has to say about it may surprise certain 
pristine viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 A poisoned ecology may be killing us, but it sure is pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody with eyes has noticed how particularly noxious days can produce 
sunsets of eerie beauty. During riot and conflagration Angelenos stay glued to 
the TV because, truth to tell, the visual spectacle of disaster is hypnotic. 
</P>
<P>
 Goode has never painted with more subtle and biting felicity. In "Miskolc" and 
"Laguna Beach" strange blob shapes float on air like liquid about to turn to 
ash. 
</P>
<P>
 There is too much philosophical intelligence and aesthetic detachment in these 
works to take them for social commentary. If we suspect that Goode has somehow 
matured to a long Asian view of things, he's happy to confirm it. His exquisite 
small collages are signed with his name in English and then translated into a 
Japanese chop mark. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; AN UNEVEN BUT SEDUCTIVE 'LES MISERABLES' IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 H oo. Hah. Arrrrgh. The convicts grunt and toil in the opening scene of "Les 
Miserables." But when prisoner 24601 breaks away from the gang, we know it's 
going to be his show. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sorta. 
</P>
<P>
 Because no matter how buff your Jean Valjean may be -- and this touring 
production at the Pasadena Civic boasts the able-voiced Donn Cook, with his 
near-operatic timbre and impressive range -- it's never really the poor schmo's 
show. The evening, and the spectacle, belong to the designer (John Napier) and 
the director-adaptors (John Caird and Trevor Nunn). 
</P>
<P>
 Which isn't so bad -- especially if you've never had an eyeful of such an epic 
extravaganza before and you can check your gray matter at the door. Few shows, 
after all, so encapsulate the seductive powers of the mega-musical, that 
phenomenon of the past decade, like Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg's 
schnitzelization of the Victor Hugo novel about the French urban poor in the 
early 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's a more lavish touring production than many, this "Miz" pales 
next to the original. Many of the secondary cast members, in particular, can 
neither act their roles nor put a dent in the Civic's daunting acoustics. And 
the show itself, for all its pomp, has only about four basic tunes, not to 
mention lyrics that double park cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when Valjean and his nemesis Javert (David Masenheimer) set off on 
their epic chase -- like Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner in frock coats -- 
"Les Miz" knows its biz. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the center of the biz is the set's huge rotating disc. Whatever 
problems "Les Miz" may have get lost in the waltz when the orchestra swells, 
the singers belt, and a cascade of wretched refuse whirls by on their Lazy 
Susan of the lumpen proletariat. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Les Mise rables," Pasadena Civic Auditorium, 300 E. Green St., Pasadena.

ABC AIRS CLINTON FOOTAGE SHOT BY NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Footage of President Clinton abruptly ending an interview with NBC reporter 
Jim Miklaszewski aired on ABC's "Nightline" Wednesday night, but not on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 The interview took place in Prague on the day when the White House agreed to 
ask for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate questions about the 
Whitewater real estate and banking affair involving President and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "NBC Nightly News" aired Clinton's strongly worded response to Miklaszewski's 
first question about Whitewater -- in which he blamed the press for presuming 
him guilty "with no evidence" -- but did not include the footage that followed, 
when Miklaszewski, who had been told he could ask two questions, began to ask a 
followup. The President stood up, took off his microphone and said, "You've had 
your two questions. I'm sorry you're not interested in the trip." 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought that the first answer -- which was part of a separate, hard-edged 
investigative story about Whitewater -- was the central element of the 
interview," "NBC Nightly News" executive producer Jeff Gralnick said Thursday, 
"and that showing his (cutting short the interview) might be perceived as a 
cheap shot by the press."  
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "Nightline" got permission from NBC to air the footage later that 
evening as part of a story about reporters traveling with Clinton on his 
European trip and bringing up the Whitewater matter.

FOUL GETAWAY; INMATE'S ESCAPE IN GARBAGE TRUCK BACKFIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-year-old inmate who escaped from prison Thursday by stowing away inside a 
garbage truck received a jolt when he was compacted into a bale of trash and 
dumped in a local landfill in front of an oncoming tractor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tractor closed in on the trash mound in which prisoner Steven Brigida 
had been discarded, the tractor driver heard a panic-stricken cry for help. The 
driver slammed on the brakes and summoned his supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigida was turned over to prison guards and Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies, who took him to Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center for 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigida was in fair condition Thursday but the nature of his injuries could 
not immediately be determined, said Kenn I. Hicks, a spokesman for the 
California State Prison in Lancaster. The inmate was serving a sentence of life 
plus eight years for attempted murder, auto theft and burglary, Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Muller, general manager of Waste Management of Lancaster, which operates 
the dump, said the prisoner is lucky to have survived inside a truck that 
compresses garbage into a bale four or five times smaller than the original 
load. 
</P>
<P>
 "The load comes out (shaped) like a loaf of bread," Muller said. "He was 
fortunate he was in the middle of the load. He was fortunate he wasn't hurt 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
 At about noon Thursday, tractor operator Joe Soliz spotted the inmate while 
breaking up garbage that had just been picked up at the prison, Muller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As (Soliz) was pushing the load over to spread it out, this man popped out in 
front of him," Muller said. "He grabbed his ankle and hopped and yelled and 
then rolled down the pile of trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was definitely hurt. He alerted us that he was a prisoner. I think his 
(escape) plan was gone by then." 
</P>
<P>
 Brigida had apparently climbed inside a prison garbage bin that was hoisted 
above a truck and then dumped into the vehicle, Muller said. Prison guards 
always escort trash trucks in and out of the facility, but the guards 
apparently did not see Brigida drop into the vehicle, prison officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people don't realize what goes into a garbage truck," Muller said. "I'm 
not sure what he was thinking when he went in there. I wouldn't go in there." 
</P>
<P>
 He was dressed in a blue denim prison uniform when he turned up at the 
landfill, Muller said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the landfill reported that an inmate might be at the dump, the prison 
began an emergency inmate count to determine whether an escape had occurred, 
prison spokesman Hicks said. The prison remained in a lock-down through 
Thursday evening, meaning that inmates could only leave their cells for meals. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison houses about 4,000 prisoners. Hicks said the staff had launched an 
investigation to determine how Brigida was able to hide in one of the garbage 
bins that are stored in a restricted area. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's incident was the fourth escape since the Lancaster prison opened 
last February. 
</P>
<P>
 In July two minimum-security prisoners walked away from their barracks but 
were quickly recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a high-security prisoner, convicted murderer Eric Rene Johnson, 
23, escaped by scaling a block wall and two chain-link fences without being 
seen by guards. He was recaptured about five hours later outside a market, 
several miles from the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident triggered an outcry from city leaders and community members, who 
were concerned about the safety of people living near the prison. The escape 
prompted the city to halt its efforts to have a second state detention center 
locate in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's flight also caused the prison's administrators to tighten security 
procedures and to vow that they would notify local sheriff's deputies and 
community leaders more promptly if another escape occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster Assistant City Manager Dennis Davenport, a member of the prison's 
advisory committee, said he was notified during the noon hour Thursday 
regarding the latest escape. He said he was pleased about the prompt 
notification, but he reserved any comment on the circumstances of the escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll wait to hear what all the facts are before we make any judgments," 
Davenport said.

MOLESTATIONS SPUR START OF SAFE HOUSE PROGRAM; CRIME: WEST VALLEY OFFICERS 
BEGIN EFFORT TO TRANSFORM PRIVATE HOMES INTO CHILDREN'S SANCTUARIES MARKED WITH 
GREEN TRIANGLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following more than two dozen attacks by a serial child molester, police have 
launched a program to convert private homes in the western San Fernando Valley 
into sanctuaries, marked by a green triangle, where children can flee for 
refuge in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hoped that the Safe House program, which officers began implementing 
Thursday at Winnetka Elementary School, will be in effect by June at all 32 
elementary schools in the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley Division, 
in cooperation with parents and school administrators, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Modeled after a program begun at Erwin Street Elementary School in Van Nuys in 
November, 1992, it identifies prescreened safe houses or apartments with a 
six-inch florescent green triangle in the window and a smaller one painted on 
the curb next to the address. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a child is on any street, there should be a place that child can run," 
said Stephanie Tisdale, a senior lead officer who is organizing the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be a safe place on every street." 
</P>
<P>
 The safe houses will be chosen by police, who will check volunteers for 
criminal records and require two recommendations, preferably by neighbors, 
Tisdale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers must agree to remain at home from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and between 2 
p.m. and 4 p.m. when children walk to and from school. In addition, the 
triangles will be numbered through a complex system under which officers will 
be able to spot unauthorized triangles that might be placed to lure children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Erwin Street Elementary School program, which West Valley police describe 
as the model for their own, was established by police and parents in the 
neighborhoods around the school after two girls were followed home from school 
by men who tried to lure them into a car. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 25 designated safe houses in the neighborhoods around Erwin Street 
School, and even though none has ever been used, organizers believe their 
existence is an asset to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that by increasing community awareness, we are actually improving our 
neighborhood," said Van Nuys Safe House coordinator Sari Pill-Kahan. "When 
people pay more attention to what is going on, there is a tendency to pick up 
garbage and paint out graffiti. We are getting people to care about their 
neighborhoods again." 
</P>
<P>
 Tisdale said that is precisely the goal of West Valley police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole purpose is to get back to a community kind of living," Tisdale 
said. "This is just another step in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly two dozen parents who showed up for the Safe House meeting at 
Winnetka Elementary School Thursday evening greeted the idea with a mixture of 
enthusiasm and resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really sad that we have to do something like this," said Lorraine 
Ronzio, who has a son attending first grade at the school. "But between the 
gangs, violence, molesters and kidnapings, we have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Gonzales, who attended Winnetka Elementary School as a child, now has two 
daughters who go there. She said she would never allow them to walk to school 
alone as she did when she was a little girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be you could let kids play outside until dinner time," Gonzales 
said. "Now I won't even let them walk around the corner." After hearing Tisdale 
describe the program, Gonzales said she would definitely turn her home into a 
safe house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great idea," she said. "Especially since they really check out 
the people." 
</P>
<P>
 The police program was developed as administrators, teachers and parents 
throughout the Valley look for ways to increase safety around their campuses 
after a series of attacks by a molester in the fall. A handful of schools have 
already implemented various safety programs and many others are meeting to 
devise plans that will fit their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Villasenor, principal of Winnetka Elementary School, called the Safe 
House program "terrific . . . anything we can do to make kids feel safer is a 
good thing."

FIRE VICTIMS RETURN TO SCENE OF DESTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Thalia Diamantopoulos stared at a 2-foot high mound of blackened debris in the 
middle of her apartment's living room floor Thursday, looked at the sky through 
the spaces in the charred beams of what used to be her ceiling and thanked God 
for her good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 A fire that Wednesday skipped through her building at 19916 Roscoe Blvd. and 
into an adjoining building, causing $350,000 in damages, had spared the lives 
of Diamantopoulos, her 6-year-old son, and everyone else in the two buildings, 
she explained. What's more, she said, while some neighbors had lost everything, 
her most important belongings seemed to have been spared. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks worse than I feel it is," she said. "I came in last night and I just 
burst into tears because all the books that Billy had since he was a baby were 
not touched, and they were the most important part. They weren't even dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the 64-unit, two-building complex made their way around the burnt 
wreckage that littered the two courtyards and tried to assess their losses 
Thursday, many of them seeing their homes for the first time since the blaze 
broke out the previous afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said 36 apartments sustained fire and water damage during the 
blaze, which summoned 19 fire companies and about 100 firefighters to the 
Cordon Apartments. The complex managers, however, said the most serious damage 
was to five apartments in each building that were gutted by fire and four units 
in each building that suffered water damage. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries in the fire, which was fueled by a wood-shingle roof 
and 25 m.p.h. winds, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the cause of the blaze was still under investigation, 
although Assistant Fire Chief Jim Young said Wednesday that there were 
unconfirmed reports by neighbors that bottle rockets and other fireworks had 
been heard in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross workers said 75 people registered Wednesday at an emergency shelter 
set up around the corner from the apartment complex, but only about 20 people 
ended up spending the night in the converted gymnasium. None of the roughly 250 
tenants were allowed to return home Wednesday night, although some were 
escorted in by firefighters to retrieve essential items. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter was expected to remain open at least through this morning, said 
Peggy Ayala, the Valley's Red Cross area supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants on the bottom floors who suffered water damage are expected to be back 
in their apartments by Tuesday, said Sue Smith, the complex's assistant 
manager. Those who were burned out were relocated into vacant units at the same 
site or into another property on Saticoy Street that is owned by the same 
company, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The burned apartments, however, could take anywhere from three to six months 
to renovate, Smith said, depending in large part on whether rain hampers 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 JoAnne Benson, who shared an apartment with her brother in one of the 
buildings, stopped by the center Thursday to see what kind of assistance she 
could obtain. She and her brother spent the night Wednesday in Benson's 
daughter's apartment but were unsure where they were going to stay during the 
coming weeks, while their waterlogged apartment undergoes renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can stay probably tonight, but then I don't know," Benson said between 
bites of a submarine sandwich provided by the Red Cross. "She has a single 
(bedroom apartment) and there are already four people." 
</P>
<P>
 Benson said she has no plans to relocate and hoped she would soon be allowed 
to move back into her home of two years. "I loved that apartment," Benson said. 
"But what I loved about it is why it burned -- there was so much wood." 
</P>
<P>
 While Benson and other neighbors made alternate living arrangements, Irma Ruiz 
set up lunch for her husband and 4-year-old daughter in the family's apartment, 
which was untouched by events of the night before. With the front door closed, 
the smell of jalapeno-topped pizza overwhelmed the burnt smell that still 
lingered around the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 But looking out the kitchen window, Ruiz could see the ravaged sections of 
roof on both apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel thankful and lucky and I thank God we're safe," she said. "I don't 
even want to remember yesterday. I was hysterical." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the complex, Diamantopoulos brushed off her son's remote control truck, 
and then tried to maintain her good humor by testing its climbing capacity, 
guiding it up a pile of burnt bits of wood and plaster. Then she pointed to a 
far wall of what used to be her kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing left on this wall but the plaster handprint my son made in 
kindergarten," she said. "I'm glad for the memories I'll be able to keep. I'll 
probably be upset later, but now I think it's great."

ATTORNEY GETS 12-YEAR TERM IN INSURANCE FRAUD SCHEME; SENTENCING: LYNN B. 
STITES WAS THE MASTERMIND OF A SECRET NETWORK KNOWN AS 'THE ALLIANCE.' THE CASE 
EMERGED AS ONE OF THE LARGEST CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS OF LAWYERS IN U.S. HISTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 Former fugitive attorney Lynn B. Stites on Thursday was sentenced to more than 
12 years in prison for his role as mastermind of "the Alliance" insurance fraud 
and legal corruption scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Clarence C. Newcomer imposed a prison term of 12 years, 7 
months for Stites' October conviction on racketeering and mail fraud charges 
stemming from his involvement with a secret network of Los Angeles-area 
lawyers. Even with credit for 14 months in custody, Stites must serve at least 
10 years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines that limit time off for 
good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomer also confirmed a forfeiture verdict allowing the federal government 
to seize Stites' assets or future earnings of up to $50 million -- the amount 
insurers supposedly lost due to his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring successful appeals by Stites and others who were previously convicted, 
Thursday's sentencing may be the final act in a case that emerged as one of the 
largest criminal prosecutions of lawyers in U.S. history. Prosecutors described 
it on Thursday as the largest fraud scheme ever that "involved the use of the 
United States legal system as a means to defraud insurance companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Stites, who formerly practiced law in West Los Angeles and Woodland Hills and 
lived in the Bell Canyon area of eastern Ventura County, was described as the 
scheme's organizer and main beneficiary. Prosecutors said that a ring of 
attorneys under his direction had bilked insurance companies of tens of 
millions of dollars in legal fees by churning complex litigations in Los 
Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen other lawyers previously received sentences ranging from probation and 
fines to 46 months in prison. Five law firm employees and clients also entered 
guilty pleas. The one remaining defendant -- Stites' former bookkeeper Roberto 
Rufino -- vanished with Stites when they were indicted in 1990, but has not 
been captured. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his apprehension in November, 1992, Stites spent more than 2 1/2 years 
in hiding, using several assumed names -- frequenting the ski slopes of 
Colorado and renting a bay-view condominium in Miami Beach, where he also 
purchased a string of hurricane-damaged boats to refurbish and sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite extensive contacts with family members, he might have remained at 
large forever had he not raced through a speed trap in Southern Illinois and 
then aroused the suspicions of a state trooper -- who spotted a pile of cash in 
Stites' sports car, obtained a search warrant and found Stites' real name among 
false identity papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing pale and gaunt Thursday in a green prison jumpsuit, Stites addressed 
the court for more than 10 minutes -- breaking a five-year public silence that 
had endured throughout the investigation and trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got too much involved in my own ego -- the money, the power," he told 
Newcomer before sentence was pronounced. "If there is any man who is truly 
broken, . . . it's me. I've made a lot of mistakes, and I'm certain . . . I'll 
pay for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to steady his voice, Stites said he most regretted the damage he 
had done to friends and family, including his children in attendance in court. 
"They've seen their father vilified as a criminal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in pronouncing sentence, Newcomer cited the harm to families of Stites' 
wayward colleagues who were "drawn into the web which he created." 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomer did grant one of Stites' requests -- saying he would recommend that 
Stites be imprisoned "where his educational background and his skills might be 
utilized as fully as possible in an education program for other inmates." 
</P>
<P>
 Stites and his cohorts, who carried out the scheme between 1984 and 1988, 
became known as "the Alliance" after a client of one of the lawyers used the 
term in a conversation secretly taped by a government informant. Sometimes the 
lawyers were referred to as the "Ventura Boulevard boys" because several were 
from the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike traditional insurance scams involving staged traffic accidents or false 
medical claims, Stites and his associates were involved in genuine legal 
disputes. According to prosecutors, what made the scam ingenious was their use 
of standard legal procedures -- such as legal discovery and the filing of cross 
claims -- to prolong and expand cases for the purpose of reaping huge fees from 
insurers who were obliged to pay legal defense costs for policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 During Stites' trial, the defense portrayed him as a skilled and tenacious 
litigator who was targeted by insurance companies for forcing them to defend 
policyholders as required by insurance contracts. The refusal of insurance 
companies to settle claims was the main reason cases dragged on and became 
unduly expensive, the defense said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Jennifer L. Keller asked Newcomer to impose a sentence of no 
more than 33 months, arguing that Stites has been ruined already. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had everything a man could want," she said. "Now he can't decide whether 
to turn on a light switch or go to the bathroom in privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. William Q. Hayes said he was pleased by the sentence, 
although he had argued for a term of up to 17 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stites, Hayes had argued, not only cheated insurance companies but defrauded 
the judicial system by needlessly tying up the courts and limiting access by 
others to strained judicial resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The court should send a message that "people who use a suit and tie and 
professional degree to steal . . . are going to be punished."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; CONTRACTOR ACCUSED OF BILKING COUPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Granada Hills man who allegedly posed as a licensed contractor has been 
charged with bilking a disabled man and his wife, both 75, and leaving them 
with thousands of dollars worth of repairs to do in their yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city attorneys filed a criminal complaint against Siosaia (Val) 
Langi, 31, in Van Nuys Municipal Court on Wednesday. Langi is charged with one 
count each of contracting without a license and unlawfully advertising as a 
contractor. The offenses together carry a minimum penalty of a $5,200 fine and 
the possibility of two years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are pointing to the case as an example of the perils of hiring 
contractors without making background checks, particularly in the wake of last 
fall's destructive brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the people hiring contractors to fix their homes, it's important to 
know you've got to call the state contractors' board to see if they are 
licensed," said Deputy City Atty. Donald Cocek.  
</P>
<P>
 The Granada Hills couple did not check Langi's credentials before hiring him 
to complete extensive landscaping work last April, Cocek said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He represented himself as being a licensed contractor," he said. But when 
Langi's work was completed at a cost of $10,110, the couple found themselves 
with a sprinkler system that didn't work, a new lawn that quickly died and a 
brick veneer with faulty concrete work that had to be redone, Cocek alleged.  
</P>
<P>
 The couple also reported that Langi trimmed trees he wasn't suppose to trim, 
broke the back gates, and left unfinished much of the work he was hired to 
complete, Cocek said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wish they never had done this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Langi pleaded no contest in March, 1992, in Van Nuys Municipal Court to 
charges that he worked as an unlicensed contractor. He was ordered to pay 
restitution, but so far has not complied, Cocek said. There is a warrant out 
for his arrest for failing to meet a court appointment in connection to that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Langi was mailed notice of the most recent charges and is scheduled for 
arraignment Feb. 15. He could not be reached for comment. JILL LEOVY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ART CONTEST FULL OF HEADY COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an art contest that asked students not only to combine their sculpting 
and creative talents, but also to use their heads -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fowler Museum of Cultural History at UCLA accepted entries from 500 
students countywide based on the theme of sculpted headrests. Such headrests 
are popular forms of folk art in part of Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was strange when I told my friends or my family what I was doing," said 
Ilana Gatti of Grant High School in Van Nuys, who won second place among high 
school students. "They asked, 'Why a headrest?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old junior created a mushroom-like headrest decorated with stars, 
flowers and hearts -- some of which glow in the dark. The idea, she said, was 
to commemorate friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three winners at the high school level were from the San Fernando 
Valley and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with winning entries from college and middle school students, their 
creations will go on display Jan. 23 beside the museum's own collection of 
headrest art. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the contest rules, students were to first sculpt their headrests, and 
then make sure that the works could hold up under the weight of their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale High School junior Estineh Mailian won the top high school award for 
making from clay a bronze and gold pillow with miniature human figures attached 
around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Gulliver's Pillow," the work is based on Jonathan Swift's "Gulliver's 
Travels," a satire whose main character wakes up surrounded by tiny people with 
very small minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us to make something I would like to sleep on," said Estineh, 16, 
an advanced art student. "I thought it was real comfortable to sleep on the 
pillow." Estineh's award came with a prize of $500. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando High School senior Geronimo Ramirez put together two walls of 
clay, sprayed graffiti on each side and called it "My Reality." The former 
graffiti tagger earned a third-place award of $100. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to write graffiti before and that's why I did it," said Ramirez, 19, 
who quit tagging to stay out of trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 Students from Culver City and La Crescenta took the top three awards at the 
middle school level, and Santa Monica Community College and UCLA students took 
the top awards at the college level. TOMMY LI

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: UNIVERSAL CITY; MCA GETS MORE TIME FOR METRO RAIL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A county transportation panel granted entertainment giant MCA a monthlong 
reprieve Thursday to find alternate sources of funding for the potential 
relocation of a Metro Rail station onto the company's Universal Studios lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned by costs and delays but willing to keep the door open on what could 
be a more strategic station site, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 
planning and programming committee unanimously voted to give its staff and MCA 
consultants more time to reconcile figures and gauge community opinion on a 
possible move. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation planners had estimated that bumping the station from its 
proposed Lankershim Boulevard location to one beneath the Hollywood Freeway 
near Cahuenga Boulevard would add an extra $41 million to the project and push 
back the planned July, 2000, opening by almost two years. Although they 
disputed those figures, MCA executives also acknowledged that there would 
probably be increased costs and a delay. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Thursday's action provides more time for the company and the 
cash-strapped transit authority to work out a compromise, MCA representatives 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the right decision," said Larry Spungin, president of MCA Development 
Co. "It takes two sides to agree. . . . We're trying to find a way to bridge 
that gap." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company was confident that a proposal could be hammered out by the 
committee's Feb. 10 meeting to offset any added costs in selecting the second 
site and to mitigate a delay in construction. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA executives had contended that relocating the station would postpone the 
opening by 15 months and boost the $420-million project by $21 million. Spungin 
said Thursday that figure could be further brought down by a jump in the number 
of passengers going to the company's CityWalk attraction and if the media 
concern buys back the Lankershim land from MTA. HENRY CHU

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; POOL HALL APPROVED DESPITE OBJECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westlake Village City Council has approved the city's first pool hall 
despite the objections of some neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 2 to 1 to grant a permit to North Hollywood resident Grigor 
Ter-Nersesian for a billiard hall and cafe in an old bank building in the 30800 
block of Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Berniece Bennett and Councilman Ken Rufener voted in favor; Mayor 
Doug Yarrow opposed. Councilman James Emmons excused himself from Wednesday's 
vote because he said his property management company manages the mini-mall 
where the pool hall is to be located. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit, which includes provisions to allow Ter-Nersesian to sell alcohol, 
sparked strong protests from neighbors who filled the back row of the council 
chambers awaiting their turns to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved here for a reason, that the neighborhood was uniquely Westlake," said 
Gregg Miller, a neighbor of the site. Uniquely Westlake, he continued, "is not 
a billiard hall serving liquor for my daughter or my 4-year-old to walk by. . . 
. This is a distraction from what we all moved here for." 
</P>
<P>
 But such arguments were countered by those of consultant Mike Kratzer, who 
represented Ter-Nersesian. Kratzer spoke of his own experiences growing up in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not much to do here but movie theaters and restaurants," he said. 
"We need to keep people in the community for their entertainment needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing pool at the hall will be costlier than many other forms of 
entertainment, Kratzer noted. The cost would discourage the poor from playing 
and would serve to "keep out the people we don't want," he said. JILL LEOVY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BUSINESSES HOPING TO LURE SPORTS TEAM

<P>
 Although they concede they have an uphill battle, leaders of an areawide 
association of businesses say they will attempt to lure a professional sports 
franchise to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get in touch with the Los Angeles Kings, the Los Angeles Rams 
and probably the Los Angeles Clippers, as well," said Bob Scott, president of 
the United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley, which represents 21 
local chambers and about 7,600 merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 The group currently is searching for locations to build a major entertainment 
and sports complex in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we're losing business, we think a good entertainment and sporting 
complex is something the Valley needs to create jobs," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the group has no funding to build such a complex, leaders of the 
group say that now is the time to reach out to local teams that are considering 
a move from their current stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 But since his group has a late start attracting the teams, Scott conceded that 
his group faces "an uphill battle" in gaining a stadium for a professional 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Rams said they might use the escape clause in their 
lease at Anaheim Stadium to relocate the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who currently play at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, intend 
to build a new, 20,000-capacity arena in Southern California, perhaps to be 
shared by the Clippers, who are looking to leave the Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Among local choices for the teams, Pasadena's Rose Bowl recently has been 
touted as a site for the Rams and Burbank has been mentioned as a site for a 
new stadium for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said the Valley has several sites, including the former General Motors 
plant in Van Nuys, that would be appropriate for the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber association will go to work identifying other sites, and Scott 
said he would like to use his influence as a planning commissioner for the city 
of Los Angeles to help expedite the site selection process. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; TENANTS HOPE PROGRAM SHUTS DOOR ON CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tiburcio Vizcarra looks forward to the day when he can find a safe parking 
place for his aging but pampered green Ford Maverick. If it means he will have 
to show identification to reach his home, and drive through a guarded gate, 
then so be it, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they would close this gate in the beginning of this month, but that 
day still has not arrived," said the 70-year-old Vizcarra, motioning to the 
steel portal that marks the western edge of Pacoima's San Fernando Gardens 
Housing Development. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still coming and going at all hours of the night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next three months, however, the Los Angeles Housing Authority hopes 
to swing the gate shut, ending an era of free rein for gangs and drug 
traffickers, and ushering in an era of controlled entry and self-policing. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Gardens will be among the first three complexes citywide to begin 
the Community Observation Response Effort (CORE) program, which is aimed at 
creating watchdog groups for the newly gated complexes, according to Ron 
Carter, the Housing Authority's citywide resident patrol manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're successful, five years from now we'll be able to pull out LAPD 
reporting sheets that say it's safer to live in public housing than in regular 
housing," said Carter. "The only measure of success I have is when I personally 
am willing to move my family there and feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The Housing Authority had delayed organizing tenant patrols until fencing and 
guard houses had been built to help control who enters housing complexes, said 
Carter. The agency plans to hire two citywide coordinators by the end of the 
month, followed by two field supervisors at each development to begin training 
the volunteer force. The patrols should be ready within the first quarter of 
the year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although commonly called tenant patrols, CORE teams will not rove the grounds 
confronting troublemakers. Instead, they will try to mediate disputes, report 
illicit activity and respond to emergencies, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing our training will do is explain to them you are not a police 
officer, you don't want to put yourself in a direct threatening position," 
Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents who live in the 448-unit San Fernando Gardens complex say they 
welcome the fences and gates already in place, and anxiously await patrols they 
have heard are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for the protection of the community," said resident Esther Topete, a 
member of the development's resident advisory council. "The majority of the 
people who talk to me about it complain that they haven't started the patrols." 
</P>
<P>
 Santana Dones, 28, a resident for four years, says she will feel safer about 
letting her children, ages 2 and 4, play unattended outside her Carl Street 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good, because they won't let the tough kids run around," she said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; 3RD TEEN-AGER FACES TRIAL IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley teen-ager was ordered Thursday to stand trial as an adult for 
the killing of an assistant manager of a Porter Ranch pizzeria in a robbery 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley Juvenile Court Judge Morton Rochman said Dusty Tyrone 
Castillo, 17, who is also charged with 11 other armed robberies, was unfit to 
be tried as a juvenile because of the sophisticated and cold-blooded nature of 
the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo -- who is expected to be arraigned Tuesday in San Fernando Superior 
Court on 26 counts including murder, armed robbery and assault with a deadly 
weapon -- is the third teen-ager to be ordered tried as an adult for the Jan. 
14, 1993, robbery-slaying of 19-year-old John Michael Holden. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the other defendants, Alex Martinez Velasquez, 18, and Oscar 
Hernandez Villanueva, 17, are being tried together. However, Judge Candace 
Beason is expected to decide on a defense motion next week to try the cases 
separately and to set a trial date. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry Mason said Castillo will probably be tried 
separately. All face maximum sentences of life in prison without the 
possibility of parole. Had they been tried and convicted in Juvenile Court, 
under state law they could not have been incarcerated beyond their 25th 
birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Castillo and Velasquez entered Ameci In & Out Pizza & 
Pasta restaurant in Porter Ranch while Villanueva waited in a getaway car. 
Detective Paul S. Tippin said the two demanded money. Holden handed over $450, 
but Castillo shot him once in the chest anyway. Holden died later in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez and Villanueva were arrested soon after the incident, but Castillo 
had eluded authorities for nearly 10 months. Police had released the name and a 
photograph of Castillo in April, and in October a television series that 
re-enacts unsolved crimes aired a story on the slaying. Castillo was arrested a 
week later in San Luis Obispo County. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo is accused of committing 12 armed robberies between Dec. 3, 1992, and 
Jan. 19, 1993, including the Holden robbery-slaying. In the 11 other incidents, 
police said, Castillo fired a shot before demanding money, but no one was 
injured. JULIO MORAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; RESIDENTS PRAISED FOR HELPING FIGHT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first meeting with the largest residents' group in Studio City, the 
Valley's new top cop lauded residents for helping to curb crime in the area in 
1993 and urged them to work harder still in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have had such a beneficial effect on the LAPD," Deputy Police Chief 
Martin Pomeroy told more than 100 people at the meeting Tuesday of the Studio 
City Residents Assn."Problems are not so overwhelming that we can't join 
together and work on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy said serious crime was down 7% last year in LAPD's North Hollywood 
Division -- which includes Studio City -- in part because of the help of 
watchful citizens. He pledged to continue and expand community based policing 
programs throughout the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy also predicted a continuing downward turn in crime as "many more 
officers will be in the field over the next few months." 
</P>
<P>
 The residents association last month launched a "Partners Against Crime" 
program in which residents with walkie-talkies will conduct foot patrols and 
report suspicious activities to police. In return, police will provide crime 
updates at the association's monthly meetings and material for its monthly 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 During a question-and-answer session, one man asked whether reports of 
antiquated communications equipment and broken-down patrol cars plaguing the 
department are true. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police cars all throughout the city are in terrible condition," the deputy 
chief said, adding that 350 new cruisers have been ordered and that he will 
fight to make sure the Valley get its fair share. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible now," he said. "But soon it's going to be all right." SCOTT 
GLOVER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; OFFICIALS TO SUBMIT REVITALIZATION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $16-million plan to revitalize Sun Valley is expected to be submitted to 
city officials today. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, developed as part of a citywide effort to revitalize eight 
neighborhoods, includes provisions for repaving streets, home improvements and 
a new community center. It was developed by community leaders in cooperation 
with City Councilman Richard Alarcon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can have a positive impact in a small area and turn a neighborhood 
around," said Alarcon, who grew up in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Valley project is one of eight special projects being developed as 
part of the Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative. The federal government has 
invited the city to apply for grants for the project, meant to revitalize 
neighborhoods using funds from a variety of federal sources -- including the 
departments of labor, housing, commerce and transportation. For all eight 
projects, Alarcon said, Los Angeles would probably ask for $80 million from the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative is a rare example in which different branches of the federal 
government would be working together to improve a neighborhood, said Lillian 
Burkenheim-Silver, project manager with the city redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon reviewed the proposal with community leaders in a meeting at the Sun 
Valley park Wednesday evening, making a few minor adjustments before the 
completed plan is submitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan includes funding for new facades and signs for commercial buildings, 
as well as repaved streets, increased parking and a new community center. 
</P>
<P>
 A home improvement loan program in the proposal would provide $1 million in 
low-interest loans to homeowners to paint and landscape their homes, and pay 
for electrical, plumbing, roofing and other repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included would be money to upgrade Roscoe Elementary School and to retain 
and attract businesses to the area and rehabilitate buildings at Sun Valley 
Park. The gutter system would also be improved to alleviate flooding during 
rains. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the plan said they hope that it will create something of a 
thriving downtown for the neighborhood, something more akin to San Fernando 
Road in Burbank, which has developed a village image. 
</P>
<P>
 "The creation of a new image is a central theme for this project," Alarcon 
said. "If we improve the community, the chances are that crime will be 
reduced." 
</P>
<P>
 A local committee would supervise the program, loaning out the money as it is 
paid back. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expect to learn if the proposals are approved sometime in 
mid-February. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; 2 MEN PLEAD GUILTY TO FORGERY CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A case involving a Canoga Park-based counterfeit ring came to an end Thursday 
when the final two defendants pleaded guilty to forgery charges stemming from 
the manufacture of phony driver's licenses and other bogus documents. 
</P>
<P>
 A multi-agency task force broke up the ring in September after undercover 
agents purchased phony documents in the names of Gov. Pete Wilson and City 
Councilwoman Laura Chick. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating in an apartment at 21217 Gault St. for three to six months, the ring 
was one of the largest in the state, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The apartment was set up exclusively for the manufacturing of driver's 
licenses, Social Security cards, Mexican residency documents and DMV 
registration documents," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Ipsen, who prosecuted 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Machado, 40, and Julio Ceasar Bustamante, 18, pleaded guilty Thursday to 
one count of forgery in Van Nuys Superior Court. They were both sentenced to 16 
months in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key figure in the ring, 24-year-old Miguel Pulido, pleaded guilty Dec. 
20 to the same charge. Judge Michael Harwin sentenced him to two years in state 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men described as salesmen -- Francisco Villa, 29; Jose Jiminez, 18; and 
Sergio Marquez, 18 -- also pleaded guilty and are currently serving jail terms 
ranging from nine months to one year. Ipsen said these three were not 
associated with the apartment and were only observed selling the phony 
documents along Sherman Way near Canoga Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ipsen said the six men were prosecuted under a law that prohibits altering a 
driver's license, the same statute that is applied to teen-agers who change 
their identification to gain entrance to bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sentencing structure for forging driver's licenses is limiting," Ipsen 
said. The maximum penalty for this crime is three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no greater punishment for operating a ring," the prosecutor said. 
"There should be a higher penalty for this crime when licenses are manufactured 
en masse." THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND-TUJUNGA; RESIDENTS HOPEFUL ABOUT LIBRARY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thursday's groundbreaking for the $2.2 million renovation and expansion of the 
Sunland-Tujunga Library could mean that the city is taking note of this 
community, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're obtaining our fair share, finally," said Joan Slater, president of the 
Sunland-Tujunga Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten nothing, really, from the city, for many years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovation project is being funded through bond money approved by voters 
in 1989 to rebuild and create city libraries. Under the construction, the 
4,500-square-foot branch will double in size and will include room for 
community meetings, children's story hours and other programs. Completion is 
expected in the summer of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The library, built in 1957, has long been in need of a renovation. It has been 
closed since October. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing can be more important to a community than a library," Los Angeles 
City Councilman Joel Wachs said in Thursday's ceremony to mark the beginning of 
the renovation project. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs joined Los Angeles city library officials and community representatives 
in unveiling a drawing of what the library will look like upon completion of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunland-Tujunga librarian Martha Houk said she was "exhilarated" that the day 
finally had come, even though she is now working in a bookmobile in the parking 
lot of the Sunland K mart with only 3,000 books of a 45,000-book collection. 
She said knowing that the new facility will have more space and a computer 
system linking the library to all other city libraries makes it easier to wait 
more than a year for the reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be worth the wait," Houk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the community said they hoped other help from the city would 
follow, such as more police officers. ED BOND

INQUIRY INTO TAXI FIRM'S INSURANCE COVERAGE BEGINS; TRANSPORTATION: CHECKER CAB 
DENIES ANY LAPSE IN POLICY, A VIOLATION SUBJECT TO REVOCATION OF ITS PERMIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A San Fernando Valley taxi firm is under investigation by city officials for 
possibly operating without insurance -- a violation of city taxi rules 
punishable by revocation of the firm's operating permit, city officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of San Fernando Valley Checker Cab acknowledged that the 
firm's insurance was canceled in December but said that the company picked up a 
new policy before the old coverage expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never a lapse in the policy," said Scott Schaffer, a representative 
of Burbank-based Checker Cab. He added that the coverage was canceled because 
the firm stopped making payments on the policy. He did not say why. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions about Checker Cab's insurance were raised Thursday at a meeting 
of the city's Board of Transportation Commissioners, which oversees the 
franchise agreements required of all taxi firms operating in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a lapse in coverage, Alan Willis, a senior transportation 
engineer, said it would be "the most serious violation that a company can 
make," the only infraction punishable by immediate franchise revocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis said he will investigate the allegation and return to the commission 
with a recommendation. If the commission decides to revoke the taxi firm's 
franchise, the firm can appeal the decision to the City Council, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis said Checker Cab's insurance company notified the city on Dec. 28 that 
the firm's insurance coverage had been canceled a few days earlier. Robert 
Yates, general manager for the department of transportation, sent Checker Cab a 
letter the following week, instructing the firm to provide proof of coverage by 
3 p.m. on Jan. 6, Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Checker Cab provided documentation for insurance before the deadline 
but the city attorney decided that the insurance offered was not acceptable 
because it was not signed by a certified insurance agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates immediately issued a notice suspending Checker Cab but lifted that 
suspension on Jan. 7, when the taxi firm provided documents showing that it had 
a new, legally binding insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis said the city still doesn't know if Checker Cab had coverage between 
the day the first policy was canceled in late December and Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not Checker Cab's first run-in with the city. In September, 1993, the 
city ordered Checker Cab to forfeit its $20,000 bond to the city for failing to 
meet a schedule for putting cabs on the road. Earlier last year, the Board of 
Transportation Commissioners put Checker Cab on a six-month probation for 
dispatching cabs that had no city permits.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: GUN BOOSTERS' RECALL CAMPAIGN MAY BE A WEAPON FOR ROBERTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA and ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IF YOU HAVE LEMONS: Can state Sen. David A. Roberti(D-Van Nuys) turn the 
recall campaign that's been leveled against him into political lemonade? Some 
believe he can. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall has not yet qualified for the ballot, but it looks like it might. 
On its face, the move to prematurely oust Roberti from his Senate seat seems 
like a nagging political lemon, especially as Roberti tries to develop momentum 
for his run for California treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 To turn this liability into an asset, Roberti must make it appear that his 
recall foe is a fanatical gun lobby, angry over his authorship of a 1989 law 
banning the sale of assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal memos of the recall movement leaked to the media and public 
statements of several of its leaders have made such a portrait seem credible. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it is argued, being the target of a gun-lobby recall campaign can give 
Roberti a certain cachet in Democratic Party circles that could provide a big 
boost to his campaign for treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent talk show interview with former state Democratic Party 
chairman Phil Angelides, an announced candidate for the treasurer post, former 
Congresswoman Bobbi Fiedler asserted that the recall could give Roberti a 
"unique opportunity" to put his own candidacy on the map. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides did not bite completely, but he did tell Fiedler that he supported 
Roberti's pro-gun control stance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a high-risk thing," speculated Assemblyman Richard Katz. "But there's 
the potential for David to use the recall to boost his visibility 
tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 As has already been reported, Roberti's efforts to portray himself as a 
high-minded and courageous victim of the gun lobby got a boost after Sarah 
Brady, head of the nationally prominent group Handgun Control Inc., called 
Roberti a gun-lobby "martyr" and pledged to support his fight against the 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't make this turn out best for David, we should be in a different 
business," added Harvey Englander, one of Roberti's many political consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ROBBINS RELEASED: With about $50 in his pocket, former state Sen. Alan Robbins 
was transferred from the Lompoc federal prison camp to a Hollywood halfway 
house this week to complete the final two months of his sentence in connection 
with his guilty pleas to political corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prison officials said that Robbins, 50, will be confined for two weeks 
to the Vineland Halfway House, then gradually be given liberty to find a job 
and possibly spend weekends at home before being released. 
</P>

 RIDGE REDUX: Make no mistake about it, the Riordan Administration has been up 
to its eyeballs in the Warner Ridge project, according to Robert Gross, 
president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Gross contended this week that he was blackballed from landing a job 
in the mayor's office because of his vociferous opposition to Warner Ridge. 
Deputy Mayor Michael Keeley cast the blackball, telling him to his face that he 
would never work for the Riordan Administration because of the homeowner 
group's stand on the issue, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly a partner in the law firm of Riordan & McKinzie -- the mayor's firm 
-- Keeley represented Morgan Guaranty Trust, the bank deeply involved in 
financing the controversial effort to develop the Warner Ridge property. Keeley 
could not be reached for comment Thursday about Gross' complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's news, of course, was that Morgan Guaranty had balked at providing 
$100 million in long-term financing to Warner Ridge's developers, prompting 
20th Century Industries -- the project's prospective tenant -- to bail out of 
the project. Without financing and a tenant, the project looked doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Thursday, the Riordan Administration was still trying to determine if it 
would be a conflict of interest for the mayor to be involved in efforts to 
salvage the Warner Ridge project -- and lobby 20th Century against leaving the 
West Valley -- given his law firm's prior relationships. 
</P>

<P>
 ON THE MOVE: To be eligible to run for seats in the state Assembly, school 
board members Mark Slavkin and Julie Korenstein must live in the districts 
represented by those seats. 
</P>
<P>
 So Slavkin has moved to a new house in West Los Angeles, just west of Century 
City, to run for the seat currently held by Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los 
Angeles). And Korenstein will have to move from Tarzana to the East Valley to 
run for the seat held by Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North Hollywood). 
</P>
<P>
 It would be the second time Korenstein relocated for political reasons. She 
moved out of her Porter Ranch home last year after the school board was 
redistricted. 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein said she doesn't mind leaving Tarzana and that she has lived all 
over the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived for 10 years in that (East Valley) area," Korenstein said. "If you 
live in the San Fernando Valley, you just find yourself a place to live. I know 
the Valley. It's the area I know the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein, who has taken the preliminary step of filing papers necessary to 
run for the 40th Assembly District seat, said she is waiting for Friedman to 
announce her plans before collecting signatures to be eligible for the ballot. 
There is wide speculation that Friedman will run for Roberti's seat, who cannot 
seek reelection due to term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin faces four opponents for the 42nd Assembly District seat being vacated 
by Margolin, who has said he will run for state insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin and Korenstein were reelected to four-year terms on the school board 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to move and we did," Slavkin said. "Although I never want to do it 
again."

 HOOP HARMONY: Rose Castaneda, district director for Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City), is organizing a 3-on-3 basketball tournament for youths in 
the northeast Valley. The goal is to promote racial sensitivity and teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda and other organizers hope to begin the first San Fernando 
Inter-Racial Basketball Tournament on or about March 1 and continue play at 
various parks and playgrounds for a month. Each team in Berman's ethnically 
diverse, low- and moderate-income district will be required to include players 
from at least two racial backgrounds. Females will also be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the championship contests in the junior (11 to 15 years old) and 
senior (16 to 21) leagues, the players will discuss racial tensions in 
community forums. Castaneda hopes to include sessions in the Los Angeles County 
Jail and juvenile justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda said that Berman will provide initial financial support from his 
campaign funds and additional contributions are being solicited from elected 
officials, businesses, individuals and community groups. The registration fee 
will be $1 per player. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was the brainchild of Ruben Ledesma, 23, a Pacoima resident and 
former member of a gang called the Pacoima Project Boys. Ledesma is a Los 
Angeles Housing Authority case manager at the San Fernando Gardens Community 
Service Center, as well as a leader of a program spearheaded by Castaneda that 
encourages gang members to seek jobs or attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was seeing a lot of racial tension around this community," Ledesma said. 
"Most of the stuff was coming from the prison system and it was spilling into 
the street. I just thought about this basketball thing to let the community 
know it's not all like that and it doesn't have to be like that. That we could 
work together for a positive purpose."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ANTELOPE VALLEY FAIR MAKING CHANGES AFTER 
CRITICAL AUDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Antelope Valley Fair is making dozens of changes in its operations in the 
wake of a scathing state audit that made nearly 200 recommendations necessary 
to bring the fair into compliance with state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair officials on Thursday released an 18-page audit response, which details 
the changes that will be made as a result of the audit released in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair Manager Bruce Latta said the fair is required "to show this plan has been 
implemented" in six months.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the changes, according to the response, were implemented even before 
the audit was released. More have been made since and some are left to be done 
in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a little more work to do," said Latta, who was hired as fair manager 
less than a year ago. "Six months from now I'll feel a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 While no criminal violations were found, auditors with the state Department of 
Food and Agriculture made nearly four times the usual number of recommendations 
compared to audits of other state fairs. In addition, auditors said many of 
their findings were "significant." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit covered a two-year period beginning Jan. 1, 1991, and found 
violations ranging from the use of state funds to buy alcohol to the employment 
of temporary workers for more days than state law permits in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous problems found during the audit had been identified in previous 
audits but never corrected, Agriculture Department officials said. This time, 
however, they said they are confident the violations will cease. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair Board President Charla Abbott said the audit has been a learning 
experience. The nine board members, some who have served for more than two 
decades, are more familiar than ever with state fair regulations as a result of 
the audit, she said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LIQUOR LICENSE FOR PROPOSED RALPHS HITS 
ANOTHER SNAG; ACTON: IF BUILT, THE GROCERY WOULD BE THE TOWN'S FIRST MAJOR 
STORE. SOME FEAR INCREASED CONVENIENCE MAY BRING AN INCREASE IN CRIME.

<P>
 Because of insufficient public notice, the County Board of Supervisors on 
Thursday was forced to schedule a second hearing on a plan to grant a liquor 
license to a proposed Ralphs grocery store in Acton. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Vannatta, planning deputy for Supervisor Mike Antonovich, estimated that 
approximately half of the residents living within 500 feet of where the 
supermarket is to be built were not notified of the hearing. State regulations 
require that neighbors who live or own property within 500 feet be notified of 
any proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission granted Ralphs 
permission to build a 46,000-square-foot supermarket at Sierra Highway and 
Crown Valley Road. At the time, a conditional use permit was not required for 
the sale of alcoholic beverages. Subsequently, the county enacted an ordinance 
requiring such a permit. Last September, Ralphs' application for a 
conditional-use permit to sell alcohol at the Acton site was denied. Ralphs 
won't build a store without being able to sell liquor in it and has appealed 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 Ralphs supporters, half of them donning navy blue caps inscribed with 
the food chain's insignia, showed up to support the supermarket. Proponents 
presented a petition with 147 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 13 opponents of the project attended and presented to Antonovich 
a petition with 460 signatures.  
</P>
<P>
 If built, the supermarket will be Acton's first major store. Some residents of 
this small rural community say they moved here to escape large stores, traffic 
lights, sidewalks and major developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said that if the store, which would be situated just off the Antelope 
Valley Freeway, were granted a liquor license, Acton would experience increased 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Small, vice president of operations for Ralphs disputed that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we presented our case well and provided sufficient information that 
a full service supermarket doesn't contribute to crime and alcohol problems," 
Small said in an interview after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents favoring the store said it would bring jobs to the city and the 
convenience of not having to drive to Palmdale or Santa Clarita to shop for 
groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatta said opponents raised sufficient issues, among them the saturation of 
liquor stores in the area, that the board would consider. Opponents said there 
are five retail liquor stores in Acton.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PROGRAM FOR ENTREPRENEURS TO BE HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Those involved with an innovative program to teach people how to start their 
own businesses say they know they have a good thing going. Now, they're getting 
some recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Local Development Corp. will receive a business 
partnership award to acknowledge its work with Antelope Valley College, the 
cities of Lancaster and Palmdale and several other organizations that have made 
the Entrepreneurial Partnership Program a success. 
</P>
<P>
 The award will be presented Feb. 9 by California Community College Economic 
Development Network in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership program was formed in 1992, resulting in the establishment of 
17 new businesses in the Antelope Valley as well as the expansion of three 
others, according to program organizers. They estimate that as many as 45 new 
jobs have been created. 
</P>
<P>
 Vern Lawson Jr., executive director of the Development Corp., said the award 
is "an opportunity to have a little validation of a community effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson said he believes it will be small businesses that pull California out 
of the recession, making the entrepreneurial program all the more important. 
</P>
<P>
 The community college network, known as EDNet, each year presents one 
partnership award in each of seven areas, including small-business programs, 
international trade and environmental technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who worked with one of the 106 community colleges in the state on 
issues such as job retention or work-force development is eligible for an 
award.  
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Lawson informing him of the award, California Community College 
Chancellor David Mertes wrote: "We appreciate your commitment to excellence and 
your support of this consortium effort focused on improving the small business 
climate in Antelope Valley."

WILSON CHIPS AWAY AT THREAT OF TACO BELL LEAVING ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB and GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, wrapping up a three-state tour to drum up business for 
California, met Thursday with a sister company of Taco Bell and urged the 
firm's top executives not to move the fast-food chain's headquarters out of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, joined by a bipartisan legislative delegation, asked Frito-Lay Co. 
officials for their help in keeping Taco Bell's headquarters in Irvine, where 
the company employs about 800 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very eager to see them stay," Wilson told reporters after the meeting 
with about half a dozen Frito-Lay executives. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour -- a reflection of Sacramento's newfound activism as California 
belatedly joins other states aggressively recruiting business -- brought Wilson 
face to face with complaints about bureaucracy, especially at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a recurring theme, as the contingent traveled through Minneapolis-St. 
Paul, Chicago and Dallas. The group met with executives from more than 20 
companies, nearly all of which already have operations in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've said: 'The state has done some good stuff. There's more you need to 
do, but, by the way, local government is not as enthusiastic about expanding 
the jobs base as state government has been,' " Assembly Republican Leader Jim 
Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson added that some local governments "do a very good job and work very 
hard at it. Others can be downright hostile." 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell has said it is considering a move, and that it hopes to get a 
decision by March from its officials and those of Pepsico Inc., which owns both 
the fast-food chain and Frito-Lay. Wilson Administration officials said the 
governor made his case to executives of Frito-Lay, based in Plano, Tex., in 
case they have a say in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has not met with Taco Bell Chief Executive John Martin, although aides 
said the governor has been trying to reach him. Taco Bell executives have met 
with a state-sponsored "red team" that is charged with keeping companies from 
moving out of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Several states -- including Texas, North Carolina and Georgia -- have been 
courting Taco Bell.  
</P>
<P>
 Frito-Lay executives complained to the delegation that local officials in 
Rancho Cucamonga have thwarted the company's plan to invest $5 million in 
expanding a warehouse. As a condition of approval, they said, the city demanded 
that the firm spend $1.5 million on utilities, sewer construction, landscaping 
and street work. 
</P>
<P>
 City Planner Brad Buller disputed that account. Frito-Lay has completed 
several expansions in Rancho Cucamonga, he said in a phone interview. In each 
case, the permit process "was very amicable," Buller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My recollection is that every expansion they've requested has been done." 
</P>
<P>
 Political campaign funds paid for the governor's trip; the taxpayers footed 
the bill for his staff and the legislators traveling with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he thinks the trip will pay dividends later, when the companies he 
visited decide whether they will expand in California or in neighboring states. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was able to make one announcement during the trip. In Chicago, he 
disclosed that R. R. Donnelly & Sons, which publishes business directories, has 
decided to invest $27 million to expand its operations in Torrance. The 
company, which employs 633 people in the state, will add 35 jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ohio-based Procter & Gamble announced that a consolidation of its 
California operations will result in the loss of about 600 jobs. The company 
said it will close a coffee plant in San Francisco, cut operations at a 
Sacramento chemicals facility and streamline a Modesto diaper plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we win on these reorganizations," Wilson said, "and sometimes we 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub reported from Dallas; Johnson reported from Orange County.

 The Scene: Nine hundred Compuserve subscribers, from Los Angeles to London, 
logged on by computer to an electronic conference room, awaiting the virtual 
presence of Vice President Al Gore, who is sitting at his own Compaq Pro Linea 
4/33 in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 A sample of the on-screen dialogue: 
</P>
<P>

 Please kill the (capital letters) . . . It's considered to be shouting and 
impolite. 
</P>
<P>
 We want AL! We want AL! We want AL! 
</P>
<P>
 Is Rush (Limbaugh) really here? 
</P>
<P>
 (U.S. News & World Report moderator Bill Allman:) Welcome, Mr. Vice President 
</P>
<P>
 (Vice President Gore:) Welcome to the White House. Let's get started. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, the man responsible for the phrase information superhighway , answered 
questions on the subject Thursday in one of the largest chat sessions ever held 
in an on-line forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president seemed intent on a conscientious performance as the Clinton 
Administration's point person on the information revolution. He was fresh from 
an appearance Tuesday at a highly publicized "superhighway summit" in Los 
Angeles, where he outlined the Administration's plans for regulating the 
industries that will build the info highway. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, at the U.S. News & World Report forum, Gore impressed his 
audience with, among other things, his typing. ("He types and spells better 
than most on-line types," someone commented afterward.) Several participants 
expressed satisfaction with his answers to questions such as, "Would you 
establish a single-source repository for all environmental data DNA lab 
analyses?" (He said he will raise the idea with his "weekly environment idea 
group.") 
</P>
<P>
 As you might expect, there were glitches. The slowness of typed exchanges 
frustrated several cyberspace citizens who could not get their questions 
answered. And line noise led to the following exchange between Gore and Aaron 
Dickey of Huntington, W.Va.: 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey: Are you at all worried that eventually we ALL may end up spending too 
much time iba*iuXEytoo (line snoise sorry) on the Net, and not enough time in 
face-to-face conversations/socialization?  
</P>
<P>
 Gore: Yes. But it's better than the same amount of time . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dickey: Line noise was my father picking up an extension, Mr. VP, sorry grin 
</P>
<P>
 Gore: . . . in front of a non-interactive . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dickey: No sir, it was my father, not your fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore: . . . screen. Plus . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Most agreed that it was at best a crude prototype of the enhanced 
communication the information superhighway ought to eventually bring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is anybody else realizing that the novelty of the experience severely 
outweighed its actual informative or usefulness?" asked one participant. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were calls for future forums. Limbaugh, who has a Compuserve 
account and was rumored to be "present," was a favorite candidate. President 
Clinton was a distant second.

GTE CORP. TO CUT 17,000 JOBS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS; COMMUNICATIONS: PHONE 
COMPANY SAYS MOVE WILL RESULT IN A $1.8-BILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE FOR FOURTH 
QUARTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest of a string of cutbacks that reflect a painful metamorphosis in 
the telecommunications industry, GTE Corp. announced Thursday that it will 
reduce the work force of its telephone operations by 23%, or 17,000 jobs, over 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stamford, Conn.-based company said the restructuring will result in a 
$1.8-billion pretax charge in the fourth quarter that ended Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE's move brings to 136,595 the number of jobs that local phone providers 
have either already cut or have proposed cutting since 1990. Just last week, 
Pacific Bell announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say these cuts could be a harbinger of more to come as competition 
intensifies and new technology makes it possible to offer more services with 
fewer people. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE is California's second-largest phone company, with 3.1 million customers 
mostly in Southern California, but it remained unclear how many jobs will be 
lost in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE California's announcement earlier this week of a plan to cut 500 employees 
is included in the 17,000 number. In the past three years, GTE California has 
been proportionately harder hit by cutbacks, losing a third of its work force, 
compared to a 16% employment decline for the company as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, GTE employs 130,000. A growing proportion of GTE's jobs are in 
Dallas, where the company's telephone operations are based, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the regional Bell operating companies, GTE faces increased competition in 
local telephone markets from cable companies and long-distance carriers such as 
MCI Communications Corp. Advanced telephone switches and high-capacity 
fiber-optic wiring are making it less costly to offer local telephone services, 
while regulatory authorities are lowering barriers to encourage competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission is soon expected to open up the 
short-haul toll business, which affects local calls not covered by basic 
services. By the end of the year, only 30% of GTE California's revenue will be 
in markets where it has a monopoly, down from 70% today, said Mike Murray, a 
GTE spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE said $680 million of its charge against earnings will go toward upgrading 
or replacing customer service and administrative systems to offer better 
service with fewer people. 
</P>
<P>
 "This plan reflects our intention to provide the best customer service in the 
industry," GTE Chairman Charles Lee said in a statement. "It is a critical part 
of our strategy to position GTE for the emerging opportunities in 
telecommunications." 
</P>
<P>
 The company will cut the number of customer contact centers from 171 to 11. It 
will also consolidate its five billing centers into one. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased computer capacity has made it possible for a single customer 
representative to handle a wide range of queries from billing to repairs, 
Murray said. Customers with existing jacks will now be able to have their 
services activated by phone without a visit from a GTE service representative. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE said it will manage and monitor its entire national network of 17 million 
access lines from one control center. The job is currently spread across 19 
regional centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Job cuts will be made across the board and will include management and service 
representatives. Employees, who have watched GTE steadily shrink its operations 
over the past decade, seem to be taking the announcement in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been going through this for quite a few years," said a GTE employee in 
personnel. "If it's not called this (restructuring), it's called something 
else. You learn to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 GTE said the charge will reduce its net income by $1.2 billion, or $1.22 a 
share, in the fourth quarter, but that it will ultimately result in annual 
savings of about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>

Exchange. Phone Company Job Reductions

GROUP URGES RISK EDUCATION ON BANK FUNDS; CONSUMERS: A COALITION SAYS IT WILL 
ASK CONGRESS FOR TOUGH DISCLOSURE LAWS ON UNINSURED INVESTMENT PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of state regulators and consumer groups said Thursday that it will 
ask Congress to enact tough new federal disclosure laws because many consumers 
do not realize the risks when they move their savings from federally insured 
accounts to mutual funds and stocks sold by banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite extensive publicity, voluntary efforts by federal regulators and 
savings institutions have failed to educate the public about the potential 
hazards of uninsured investments, said Craig A. Goettsch, president of the 
North American Securities Administrators Assn., a group that represents state 
securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw what happened with the outpouring of consumer panic and distrust in 
the wake of . . . 'Black Monday,' " he told a news conference, recalling the 
day in 1987 when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 500 points. 
"And that was when most of the backlash was focused against brokerage firms and 
investment companies. Now banks have opened themselves up to the same reaction 
from the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining in the demand for strict federal laws were the Consumer Federation of 
America and the American Assn. of Retired Persons, whose 32 million members are 
a favorite target of aggressive sales campaigns by financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many older investors have seen the income from their insured savings accounts 
and certificates of deposit drastically lowered by plummeting interest rates," 
said Lena Archuleta, a board member of the AARP. 
</P>
<P>
 "This substantial loss of income has driven many older people into much 
riskier investments," she said. "In too many cases, older people have made 
these investments without fully understanding the risks involved." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of 1,000 bank customers conducted for the securities administrators 
group and the AARP showed that only 18% were aware that mutual funds are not 
covered by the federal deposit insurance that protects savings accounts up to 
$100,000. Only 25% knew that stocks sold by banks lack insurance, and 14% were 
aware of the same problem with annuities, which are investment contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal insurance protection at banks and savings and loan associations is 
limited to savings accounts, checking accounts and certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of uninsured products is a growing, profitable business for financial 
institutions, which have been under severe competitive pressure. Banks and S&Ls 
sold $69 billion worth of mutual funds last year, about 15% of total fund 
sales, according to Cerulli Associates, a Boston consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, consumers are unaware that the protections of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. shield do not extend to investment products peddled in the 
lobbies of insured financial institutions," said Chris Lewis, director of 
banking policy at the Consumer Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Congress must take responsibility and move on a fast track to pass 
safeguards that will ensure that there can be no commingling -- in practice or 
perception -- of insured and uninsured activities of banks and thrifts." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is seeking a law that would: 
</P>
<P>
 * Require every customer to sign a statement indicating an understanding that 
stocks or mutual funds or annuities lack federal protection and that investors 
can suffer a loss of principal. A "simple English" document would be used, 
along with posters in bank lobbies.

 * Establish the same safeguards enjoyed by customers of brokerage firms,

THIS BUD'S FOR BORA; BUCKING PROTOCOL, WORLD CUP SOCCER COACH WILL HAWK BEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Super Bowl of soccer -- the 1994 World Cup -- is aired next summer, 
the charismatic head coach of America's World Cup team, Bora Milutinovic, will 
star in Spanish-language TV and print ads promoting Budweiser beer. 
</P>
<P>
 And that has some critics raising sharp protests. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, consumers would never see an active National Football league coach 
hawking beer. The NFL forbids current coaches or players from appearing in ads 
for alcoholic beverages -- except those that promote responsible drinking. So 
does Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Assn. and the National 
Hockey League. What's more, federal regulations -- and self-imposed beer 
industry guidelines -- have historically been interpreted as prohibiting active 
athletes as well as coaches from appearing in beer ads. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Budweiser sales declining in recent years, some consumer activists 
suggest the move is one of desperation by brewer Anheuser-Busch. The 1993 
Maxwell Consumer Report, a highly regarded monitor of the food, beverage and 
tobacco industries, reports that Budweiser's market share has dropped for five 
consecutive years. It plummeted 3.1% in 1993 to 23.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 That has left the brewer scrambling for new markets, such as Latinos. Even the 
government bureau that oversees ad regulations for alcoholic beverages says 
that with this campaign, Anheuser-Busch appears to be ignoring federal 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe Anheuser-Busch plans to commit millions of dollars to this 
campaign," said Les Stanford, information officer at the Washington-based 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The spots are scheduled to be filmed 
sometime this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't recall any ads with active coaches promoting beer, and there's a good 
reason for it," Stanford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a coach pushing an alcoholic beverage, well, we look at it the same 
as if you're a player. That's a no-no," he said, referring to "false or 
misleading" ad practices prohibited by the Federal Alcohol Administration Act 
of 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1950s, the bureau specifically ruled against the use of active 
athletes in alcoholic beverage advertisements, saying such ads imply that 
alcohol somehow contributes to athletic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The big beer makers have a long history of trying to link their images with 
athletes and coaches. During this year's Super Bowl, for example, Budweiser 
will broadcast several beer ads featuring Mike Ditka, former head coach of the 
Chicago Bears, and Bum Phillips, former head coach of the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Pat Riley, now head coach of the New York Knicks and former 
Los Angeles Lakers coach, is in the midst of a multiyear contract as a 
spokesman for Miller Brewing Co.'s "Think When You Drink" campaign. Similarly, 
Miami Dolphin quarterback Dan Marino has been a paid spokesman for 
Anheuser-Busch's "Know When to Say When" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the 1988 Winter Olympic Games, the U.S. Ice Hockey Team briefly sold ad 
space on the hockey players' helmets to Budweiser, which pasted "Bud" on the 
sides of the helmets. After consumer complaints and objections from Olympic 
officials, the logos were removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Several consumer groups are particularly unhappy with Budweiser's latest 
proposal to feature the head coach of the U.S. Soccer Team. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is irresponsible and shows a lack of concern for the Hispanic population 
and its youth," said Jane Delgado, president and chief executive of the 
National Coalition of Hispanic Health & Human Services Organizations, a Latino 
consumer group in Washington. "It's using a respected figure to promote a 
product that's clearly not for youth. I guess it's a free-for-all out there and 
all people care about is market share." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she hopes the ads never run. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally outspoken is Peggy Charren, co-founder of the consumer group Action 
for Children's Television. "The World Cup is one of the few programs you 
wouldn't want to turn off when your kids are watching," she said. "But here's a 
beer salesman who would be very attractive to kids. Kids will trust this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will kids trust him, but they will probably be inclined to want to 
drink his brand of beer, said Sarah Kayson, director of public policy at the 
Washington-based National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence. "This is 
one message that we don't think should be sent to kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic, the soccer coach who will star in the ads, conceded in a 
telephone interview that he doesn't even drink Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't drink beer. I don't like it," said Milutinovic, who is fluent in five 
languages, including English and Spanish. "I drink 7-Up." 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic is widely regarded for coaching the Mexican national team to sixth 
place in the 1986 World Cup held in Mexico, and for coaching the 1990 Costa 
Rican team that surprised many fans by qualifying for the second round of the 
World Cup in Italy. The team he now coaches, Team USA, also surprised the 
soccer world with a 2-0 win over England in the 1993 U.S. Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic said he doesn't think there is anything wrong with him appearing 
in ads for Anheuser-Busch, "because they've helped the sport of soccer so 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Anheuser-Busch has sponsored soccer events in the United States for 15 
years, including televised sponsorship of the past two World Cups. And it is a 
so-called marketing partner with the upcoming World Cup, which is hoping to 
whet American interest in soccer by holding the finals in the United States 
this year for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The final game is scheduled at the Rose Bowl on June 17. It is expected to be 
seen by an estimated 2 billion viewers worldwide -- nearly twice the audience 
of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at Anheuser-Busch, which has paid an estimated $3.5 million to be 
the exclusive beer sponsor of World Cup soccer, insist there is nothing wrong 
-- legally or morally -- with using Milutinovic in its Budweiser ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't see Bora holding a Bud and saying, 'When I drink beer, I drink 
Bud,' " said Alejandro Ruelas, senior manager of ethnic marketing at 
Anheuser-Busch. "Every piece of work we're doing is being done with the best 
interest of the game at heart." 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly have sensitivity about any advertising that might undermine the 
millions of dollars we're spending to discourage underage drinking," said Joe 
Castellano, vice president of consumer awareness and education at 
Anheuser-Busch. The Milutinovic campaign, he said, was a "no brainer" because 
the World Cup "is clearly an adult-oriented event." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Castellano said, Anheuser-Busch believes the federal regulations 
that prohibit active athletes from appearing in beer ads do not bar active 
coaches. The bureau has "never construed (the use of) coaches as a violation," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does the Beer Institute, the Washington-based beer industry lobby, see 
anything wrong with the proposed campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at (Milutinovic) as a role model, it can send a positive message 
to the Hispanic community," said Jeff Becker, vice president of alcohol issues. 
"On the one hand, you have some people asking you to be more inclusive in your 
advertising, and on the other hand, you have others who will say, 'That's a bad 
idea' to anything you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior executives with World Cup '94 say they have no problems with the 
relationship between Anheuser-Busch and Milutinovic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything (Anheuser-Busch) has done has been in very good taste," said 
Lester Wintz, senior vice president of external affairs at World Cup USA '94. 
"I have no concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 But one sports marketing expert suggested that the World Cup is simply bending 
to the pressure of a major sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the World Cup committee wrestled with this one," said Martin 
Blackman, a New York-based sports marketing consultant. "But put yourself in 
their shoes. Bud is giving you a lot of dough. So there might be hesitation on 
their part to say to Bud, 'Back off.' But I think they should have." Bud Loses 
Some Fizz Budweiser beer -- the best-selling beer in the United States -- has 
seen its market share and sales fall for the last five years.

 Aetna to Pay $31 Million in Prop. 103 Rebates: More than 170,000 California 
holders of Aetna Life & Casualty Co. policies will receive $31 million in 
premium rebates under a settlement with the state Insurance Department.The 
rebates will average $271 each for 83,000 auto insurance customers and $96 each 
for 87,000 holders of homeowner policies. Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi 
ordered Aetna in October, 1991, to rebate $137 million under the Proposition 
103 insurance rollback initiative. The agreement credits the Hartford-based 
insurer with $55 million for reduced premiums in 1989 to commercial 
policyholders.

INLAND EMPIRE DOWNTURN SEEN LINGERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Inland Empire, plagued by rising joblessness and soaring real estate 
foreclosures, can expect little relief in 1994, economists at Chapman 
University said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring counties will log a year of modest recovery and slight employment 
gains.But Riverside and San Bernardino counties are likely to see a second year 
of job losses as employers pare about 2,000 positions from their payrolls, said 
Esmael Adibi, director of the university's Center for Economic Research. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest factor in the two counties' downturn will be a continuing decline 
in the construction industry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Adibi, who presented the gloomy forecast to a group of Inland Empire 
business and civic leaders in Riverside, added that the two counties should 
begin seeing improvement by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 That the Inland Empire's economy will trail its neighbors out of recession 
should be no surprise, Adibi said, as it trailed going in.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people there who lost jobs in 1991 and 1992 were employed by 
companies in Orange and Los Angeles counties. It was only last year that they 
started losing local employment," Adibi said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the 1993 losses came in construction, down 16,600 positions, and 
manufacturing, which dropped 2,500 jobs. Not quite offsetting those declines 
was a gain of 16,500 jobs in retail, transportation, government and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the two counties posted a net loss of 2,600 jobs for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Continued weakness in construction will be the culprit, Adibi said. The 
Chapman economic center predicts a 2% decline in the value of new building 
projects in the two counties this year, to $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 On a further grim note, Adibi predicted that average housing prices in the two 
counties will drop 2.6% this year.

CITICORP PLANS TO SELL QUOTRON TO REUTERS, END ILL-FATED ACQUISITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citicorp announced Thursday that it has agreed to sell most of its disastrous 
Quotron market data business to Reuters America Holdings and take a 
$179-million writeoff as a result, a move that would effectively rid the 
banking giant of an ill-fated acquisition that it once hoped would put it on 
the cutting edge of the Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Citicorp also said it will set aside $425 million to pay for a 
restructuring aimed at improving productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Citicorp is selling Quotron, which provides Wall Street data to 
investment managers and securities brokers, at a time when most companies 
cannot seem to get enough of information-related ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition of Los Angeles-based Quotron was once hailed as an innovative 
move by Citicorp Chairman John Reed, who championed the $680-million 
acquisition in a somewhat unfriendly deal in 1986.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the name Quotron was to stock-quote terminals what Kleenex is to 
tissues. Tens of thousands of the computer-like terminals sat on the desks of 
stockbrokers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But Quotron proved to be a sea of red ink for Citicorp as its once-dominant 
business was eaten away by aggressive competitors such as Automatic Data 
Processing, Reuters and Bloomberg Business News.  
</P>
<P>
 Quotron also suffered some embarrassing moments, such as the day in 1989 when 
it could not get the Dow Jones industrial average right while the market was 
fluctuating wildly. 
</P>
<P>
 Citicorp's information business segment was plagued by losses for years, and 
layoffs became commonplace. In 1991, Citicorp shocked Wall Street when it took 
a $400-million charge in its third quarter as a result of Quotron's problems.

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * News of an unexpected surge in December retail sales cooled off a weeklong 
Treasury market rally Thursday, sending yields soaring and prices plunging by 
nearly a point. 
</P>
<P>
 * The rising bond rates and weakness in foreign markets pushed blue-chip 
stocks lower. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 Bond market strategists said signs of economic strength gave investors an 
excuse to sell bonds and profit from the recent rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield jumped to 6.25% from 6.18% on 
Wednesday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, tumbled 31/32 
point, or $9.69 per $1,000 in face value. The Commerce Department said retail 
sales in December rose 0.8%, with store owners enjoying their biggest sales 
increase since before the 1990-91 recession. Economists had expected a rise of 
just 0.3%. For all of 1993, sales were up 6.2% from the previous year. It was 
the best showing since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices had soared nearly 3 points in the previous five trading days amid 
optimism that economic growth is moderate and not likely to fuel inflation, 
which can reduce the value of fixed-income securities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday's retail sales report -- along with another government report 
indicating that inflation may have bottomed out -- sparked a round of profit 
taking. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bond traders are sitting on pins and needles today," said Sung Won Sohn, 
a senior economist based in Minneapolis. "The market is definitely more 
bearish." 
</P>
<P>
 In the inflation report, the Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.2% 
in December as a big drop in energy costs helped offset higher food prices. 
That was even with November's rise, but analysts had expected a gain of just 
0.1%. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed lower but well above its lowest levels 
of the day, at 3,842.43, down 6.20. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks fared better. The Nasdaq market's composite index managed to 
dig out of a hole and creep up 0.94 to a new high of 787.81. It beat its prior 
best of 787.42, reached Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume came to 277.97 million shares, down from 310.69 million 
Wednesday, which marked the seventh straight session in which more than 300 
million shares were traded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, falling issues outnumbered advances on the New York 
Stock Exchange, where 1,146 stocks fell in price, 928 issues gained and 664 
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks moved lower from the start of trading, tracking the direction of bonds. 
Sellers were motivated to collect profits amassed during the recent run-up in 
prices that carried the Dow industrials to a succession of new highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Market watchers were comforted that the selling occurred on a day of lower 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy selling in major foreign financial centers was negative for business at 
home. Stocks sagged in Tokyo, with the Nikkei 225-share average losing 216.62 
points and closing at 18,577.26. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX average closed 
at 2,164.66, down 44.52 points, while London's financial Times 100-share

JAPAN CALLS U.S. TRADE THREAT 'REGRETTABLE'; COMMERCE: JAPANESE OFFICIAL SAYS 
U.S. SUGGESTION THAT IT MIGHT IMPOSE SANCTIONS WON'T HELP FOSTER TRUST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Japan hit back sharply Thursday at a U.S. threat to impose trade sanctions if 
ongoing bilateral trade talks do not do enough to boost foreign access to 
Japanese markets. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Hideaki Kumano, vice minister of international trade and 
industry, called "regrettable" the suggestion Wednesday by U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor that the Clinton Administration might revive 
so-called Super 301 measures, a feature of U.S. trade law that expired in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, the U.S. government was required to conduct an annual review of 
trade barriers abroad and impose retaliatory sanctions if serious barriers were 
not lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suggesting the revival of Super 301 won't do any good in fostering trust 
between the two countries," Kumano said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials previously had hinted at a willingness to impose trade 
sanctions on Japan if necessary, but Kantor made the threat explicit in a 
Washington meeting with a group of Japanese journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Revival of Super 301 "would be an option" if current trade talks do not 
produce satisfactory results, Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bilateral talks are focused on the import of U.S. automobiles and auto 
parts to Japan, as well as on telecommunications services, insurance, medical 
technology and intellectual property rights. Under the ground rules for the 
talks, an initial set of agreements in these areas is to be reached in time for 
a Feb. 11 Washington meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, speaking at a separate news 
conference Thursday, warned that Kantor's threat runs "counter to the spirit" 
of the trade talks. "We cannot help feeling great concern," Takemura said. "We 
want the U.S. to act cautiously." 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor's comments did not take the Japanese government completely by surprise. 
Hosokawa told a group of top business leaders Wednesday -- before Kantor made 
his remarks -- that if the U.S. tried to impose Super 301-style trade 
sanctions, Japan would fight back through the World Trade Organization, the new 
body due to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under December's GATT agreement, the World Trade Organization will operate 
what Tokyo expects to be a more effective dispute settlement panel than 
anything that existed previously. Japanese officials have said the mechanism 
will provide significant protection against unfair imposition of trade 
sanctions by other countries.

 New York Investigates Prudential Insurance: Regulators said they are 
investigating the company for selling group annuity contracts that were never 
approved by the state. A Prudential spokesman said similar violations could 
have occurred in other states.He said the company is conducting its own 
internal review. A spokesman for the New York state insurance department said 
the unauthorized group contracts affected thousands of individuals. In a 
related development, federal prosecutors investigating fraud at Prudential 
Securities have issued subpoenas to former and current executives of the firm, 
according to a published report. Prosecutors have expanded their investigation 
into sales of VMS Mortgage Investment, one of the biggest limited partnerships 
offered by Prudential. Prosecutors had focused on sales of $1.3 billion in 
Prudential-Bache Energy Income partnerships to 130,000 people.

 Jury Limits USAir's Liability for Crash: A federal jury in Cleveland decided 
that the airline should not have to pay punitive damages for the accident at 
New York's La Guardia Airport in March, which killed 27 people and injured 24 
others. The jury found that the carrier was not reckless in its operation of 
the Cleveland-bound flight, which plunged into Flushing Bay while taking off in 
a snowstorm. U.S. District Judge Thomas D. Lambros earlier ruled that the 
airline was negligent and therefore liable for medical expenses and other 
compensatory damages.

 Alaska Airlines Reaches Tentative Labor Pact: Alaska Air Group Inc. and its 
flight attendants said they reached the tentative agreement on a 3 1/2-year-old 
dispute involving 1,500 employees.Details of the deal were not disclosed, but 
Ray Vecci, chairman and chief executive of Alaska Airlines, said both sides 
showed "a willingness . . . to depart from entrenched positions." The Assn. of 
Flight Attendants will recommend approval of the agreement when it goes to a 
vote in mid-February, union leader Gail Bigelow said. The previous contract 
expired in August, 1990. Negotiations broke down in June after the company 
imposed a new wage increase and work rules similar to its final proposal, which 
included a 3% pay raise.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: PHIL & JIM'S NOT TALKING ABOUT BANKRUPTCY HINT 
</P>

<P>
 Executives at Phil & Jim's would not comment Thursday on a report that the 
long-established TV and appliance store chain is considering bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The report "has no validity, and beyond that I have no comment," said Phil 
Delgado Jr., Phil & Jim's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado, who in 1992 succeeded his father, Phil Delgado Sr., as president, 
also would not comment on whether the company has been hurt by the persistent 
Southern California economic slump, which has forced a number of local 
retailers into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 An employee at one of the chain's 11 Orange County stores, however, said that 
a bankruptcy filing is possible. And an employee at another store said the 
company is seeking to restructure its debt with assistance from Maytag Corp., 
Whirlpool and General Electric, three of the chain's major creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 A third store employee said that the company has temporarily stopped selling 
warranties on products because of a cash-flow problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado would not comment on the warranty issue or confirm whether the company 
is working with creditors to restructure debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil & Jim's, based in Anaheim, was founded 39 years ago. It has about 200 
employees -- half as many as in the late 1980s. GREG JOHNSON

MET LIFE SAYS LAWYERS, CHIEF KNEW OF MAILINGS; INSURANCE: DISCLOSURE RAISES NEW 
QUESTIONS IN CONTINUING PROBE OF LETTERS THAT PUSHED POLICIES AS RETIREMENT 
INVESTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. disclosed Thursday that its president and 
senior lawyers knew for months about questionable sales promotion letters 
before the mailings were stopped last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Met Life, the nation's biggest seller of life insurance, said lawyers at its 
New York headquarters approved letters sent by the company's Tampa, Fla., 
office from mid-January through September. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters, pitching insurance as a retirement plan for nurses, are being 
investigated as potential evidence of deception in at least 17 states. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's acknowledgment raises new concerns with investigators at a time 
when the troubled insurer had been trying to lay the controversy to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "This disclosure raises questions for top Met Life management that we now 
intend to pursue," said Thomas Tew, Florida's lead investigator. "For one 
thing, it raises questions as to whether the company's prior disciplinary 
actions are a cover-up." 
</P>
<P>
 Met Life last month dismissed seven mid-level and senior executives, saying 
they had failed to ensure that the Tampa sales letters were properly 
authorized. The highest-ranking executives let go were Senior Vice President 
Richard Maurer, the company's No. 2 personal insurance executive, and Arthur 
Spector, a vice president who developed sales brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Mandel, the company's top personal insurance lawyer, denied that the 
headquarters-approved letters were misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the letters we approved in 1993 were perfectly good from a legal point of 
view," said Mandel, a vice president who supervises more than 20 lawyers. "They 
all made clear references to life insurance or permanent life." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandel said the home office last year approved four letters that were models 
for mass mailings from Tampa for 8 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandel's statement alters the company's long-held position that the Tampa 
letters were improper because they had not been authorized by headquarters 
lawyers before last September.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE : FLOOD OF OPINION ON PHONE RATES

 Forced to reconsider its decision to boost basic telephone rates due to 
procedural irregularities, the California Public Utilities Commission is giving 
participants another crack at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Local telephone companies and ratepayer advocacy groups have recently filed 
hundreds of pages of documents seeking changes. Here are some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The PUC's Division of Ratepayer Advocates strongly suggests that the 
increase in basic residential rates for Pacific Bell customers to $13 from 
$8.35 is excessive. The division estimates the rate hike would provide a 
windfall of up to $200 million for Pac Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pacific Bell says the division is wrong. It says it could lose toll revenue 
-- money from in-state calls beyond 12 miles -- as customers switch to cheaper 
calling plans and services. 
</P>
<P>
 * GTE of California says its residential rates aren't high enough to 
compensate for an estimated $215 revenue shortfall. GTE wants to increase 
charges for basic residential service to $19.50 a month from the current $9.75. 
The rescinded decision set a $17.80 rate. As an alternative to the $19.50 rate, 
GTE is asking for a surcharge on all customers. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city of Los Angeles called the rescinded decision "anti-business." It 
said increases in monthly basic business rates -- to $10.86 from $8.35 for Pac 
Bell and to $25 from $9.10 for GTE -- would "discourage business growth and 
reduce the amount of money flowing into the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC is expected to issue a new decision this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coupon usage clipped: Consumers redeemed 12% fewer coupons last year than in 
1992, the first time coupon usage has declined in 23 years, reports the 
coupon-processing firm of NCH Promotional Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said that while manufacturers issued fewer coupons last year, 
usage declined primarily because manufacturers shortened average expiration 
dates on coupons to 3.1 months from 4 months. The shorter expiration period in 
1993 meant there were 26% fewer usable coupons in any given month, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 NCH Promotional Services said manufacturers have tightened expiration dates to 
limit their liabilities and to move products more quickly through stores. The 
number of coupons issued declined because some manufacturers shifted to 
everyday-low-pricing strategies. Procter & Gamble, for example, has lowered 
prices and eliminated coupons on some items, such as disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Getting your interest: Mellon Bank this week is introducing a credit card that 
refunds interest payments to cardholders after 20 years. The bank says that at 
today's interest rates, the average cardholder would pay 17.9% on balances and 
get back $8,700 in 2014. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a good deal? It depends. The bank won't pay you interest on your 
interest. So people who pay their balances off monthly and invest what they 
would have paid in interest could earn double or triple what Mellon will pay in 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The card makes more sense for people who seldom pay their balances monthly. 
But these people may want to choose a card that charges less than 17.9% 
interest and enjoy savings now, not 20 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A better idea: "Put Ford quality in your financial future," says the letter to 
Ford car owners from San Francisco-based First Nationwide Bank. The Ford-owned 
thrift is pitching an annuity issued by another Ford unit, Ford Life Insurance 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 What the letter doesn't say is that Ford may be taking the financial out of 
its future. The car manufacturer is reportedly trying to unload money-losing 
First Nationwide. The life insurance unit, which is separate from First 
Nationwide, would presumably remain under the Ford umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fast fries: When we spotted "Fast Fries" from Ore-Ida Foods Inc., we thought 
we'd finally found a frozen French fry that cooks quickly. We were wrong. The 
label says these fries are ready in 20 minutes, fairly typical for frozen 
fries. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes them fast? The label on the back of the package says the fries are 
"fast-food style." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oops: We mischaracterized LDDS Communications in last week's column. The 
Jackson, Miss.-based firm has a tiny 2% share of the long-distance telephone 
market, but with about $1.5 billion in revenue, it isn't small.

DISNEY IS ONE STEP CLOSER TO BROADWAY; STAGE: AFTER SETTING RECORDS DURING 
TRIAL RUN OF 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' IN HOUSTON, ALL EYES ARE ON APRIL DEBUT IN 
NEW YORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIANNE HART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 50 performances here in six weeks, "Beauty and the Beast" is headed for 
Broadway in a caravan of 28 equipment trucks. Walt Disney Co. can only hope 
that sellout audiences will follow when its stage adaptation of the classic 
story opens in late April. 
</P>
<P>
 The show has the markings of a winner. It grossed a record $4.7 million during 
its tryout run and was extended after 10,117 tickets were sold in one day. 
That's second only to first-day sales of "Phantom of the Opera" tickets in New 
York, said Frank Young, executive director of Theatre Under the Stars, the 
musical theater company that collaborated with Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Disney executives acknowledge that Broadway success is hardly assured 
as they embark on their first foray into New York theater, which is a 
notoriously difficult and expensive environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to know how the New York audiences will respond," said Disney 
Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg. "Having seen how they responded (in 
Houston) I guess has raised our hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston offered Disney a chance to test the show away from media centers and 
the critics who can close a show in a night. It was chosen after the 
25-year-old Theatre Under the Stars teamed with the Texas governor, Houston's 
mayor and local businesses to persuade Disney to bring the show to town. "We 
compared it to trying to get the Republican Convention here," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities Disney considered include Los Angeles, Montreal and Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Burbank-based company will not discuss production costs for the 
show, they are rumored to have run as high as $10 million. Young said that 
Theatre Under the Stars contributed $1.5 million in Houston, with Disney 
providing the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the lessons the company learned here is the value of aggressive 
marketing. Aside from the usual advertising, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael 
D. Eisner joined Houston sports and news figures to read from some of 1,500 
books the company donated to disadvantaged children, and a local station aired 
an hourlong prime-time feature about the show on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives in New York hinted that similar tactics will be employed there.  
</P>
<P>
 If the New York reception echoes the Houston response, Disney could mount 
other theatrical projects. It recently announced plans to lease a Broadway-area 
theater, though not for "Beauty and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg said it is "premature to speculate what the next move is other than 
if we have just some success in this, that obviously would encourage us to keep 
going. . . . We have spent time and resources looking at some possibilities for 
future productions, but we have not committed." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney may also be hard-pressed to find many projects as promising as "Beauty 
and the Beast," a classic romantic tale with several memorable songs. The 
animated feature has grossed almost $350 million theatrically worldwide. Aside 
from that, Disney has made as much as a $200-million profit so far from the 
domestic sale of about 22 million videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner said that "Beauty and the Beast" seemed to be a perfect live vehicle 
for the Broadway-type stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney drew from its theme park experience when launching its Theatrical 
Productions unit last year. The producer, director, scene designer and 
choreographer for the stage version of "Beauty and the Beast" all worked on 
live entertainment shows at Disney theme parks. 
</P>

 The mythology of the show was slightly altered because, producer Robert McTyre 
noted, "you can't do everything on stage that you can do in animation."

 If Disney mounts other stage productions, it will probably test them as it did 
"Beauty and the Beast" in Houston.

SOUND BITES -- AND BARKS -- FROM UCLA MULTIMEDIA CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The information superhighway summit conference sponsored by the Academy of TV 
Arts & Science earlier this week at UCLA brought together 30 of the top people 
in the communications and entertainment industries to brainstorm for a day 
about the 500-channel, multimedia future. 
</P>
<P>
 The only consensus from the summit was that there is no consensus about what 
the future holds, except that the electronic superhighway, with the viewer-user 
clicking away at a hybrid TV set-computer-telephone, will provide a wealth of 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 But if there was no agreement about what it all means or how the industry will 
develop, at least there were some sharp insights and rejoinders, a sampling of 
which are offered below. 
</P>
<P>
 Most tortured use of superhighway metaphors: 
</P>
<P>
 "These are 30 of the smartest people . . . riverboat gamblers on the 
information superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rich Frank, president, Walt Disney Studios, introducing the all-star lineup 
of communications executives.  
</P>
<P>
 "The ability to create this highway is the easy part . . . but there will be 
some road kill as we determine what consumers want." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Richard C. Notebaert, president, Ameritech  
</P>
<P>
 Superhighway retailing concept most likely to appeal to Al Bundy: 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always said buying underwear in your underwear is tough to beat as a 
concept." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Barry Diller, chairman, QVC (home shopping) Network Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 Sharpest rejoinder to superhighway builders: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to start a news channel that competes with CNN, but (Time Warner 
Chairman) Gerald Levin and (Tele-Communications Inc. Chief Executive) John C. 
Malone won't give me the time of day." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rupert Murdoch, chief executive, News Corp.  
</P>
<P>
 Sharpest rejoinder to those who would regulate the superhighway: 
</P>
<P>
 CNN anchor Bernard Shaw: "Is the only good regulator a dead regulator?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert Murdoch: "Dead. Yes, dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Most populist takes on the superhighway: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not about the right to play video games. It's about guaranteeing the 
right to essential services." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Al Gore, vice president  
</P>
<P>
 "A bigger question is: Will the neighborhood still be there when the highway 
arrives? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robert Johnson, president, Black Entertainment Television  
</P>
<P>
 Most self-interested superhighway comment: 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, there is no fear up here." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ray Smith, chief executive, Bell Atlantic Corp., during CEOs forum  
</P>
<P>
 Second-most self-interested superhighway comment: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no field of dreams. It's not 'build it and they will come.' The bulk 
of the revenues to support this infrastructure is already built today." -- John 
C. Malone, Tele-Communications Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 Third-most self-interested superhighway comment: 
</P>
<P>
 "The story is first, second, third. Making sure someone sees the story is 
fourth, fifth, sixth." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael D. Eisner, Walt Disney Co. chairman, who is not in the technology 
business.

 * Cable TV: One of cable's stranger stories has gotten even stranger. In a 
cryptic announcement, religious broadcaster Pat Robertson's International 
Family Entertainment said it has ended a $40-million tender offer for Nostalgia 
Network cable channel.The announcement comes as Los Angeles-based Nostalgia is 
about to suffer a major blow to its business when Time Warner Inc.'s cable 
operation in Manhattan drops it effective Feb. 1. Nostalgia, which aims its 
programs at people 45 and older, will lose access to nearly 500,000 
subscribers. Dick Aurelio, president of Time Warner's New York City cable 
group, said only one complaint has been received about the decision to drop the 
channel. The Robertson group had been vying for the channel against a group 
with links to the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. Nostalgia representatives did not return 
calls.JAMES BATES

OFFICE SPACE VACANCY RATE DECLINES 2.5% DURING 1993 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a signal that the shaky local real estate market may be firming up, more 
office space was occupied in Orange County during 1993 than in the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The retail market, however, showed a decline, mainly because of the closing of 
several Builders Emporium stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The office vacancy rate fell 2.5% last year, according to year-end figures 
from Grubb & Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 1994 will be a transition year, and by 1995 the office market will 
have stabilized," said Lonnie J. Riddle, an office broker in Grubb & Ellis' 
Anaheim office. "There are pockets in the county where it will still be 
possible for tenants to get good deals in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's office vacancy rate for the final quarter last year was 18.1%, 
down from 20.6% at the end of 1992, Grubb & Ellis reported. The real estate 
brokerage tracks tenant movement in 54 million square feet of Orange County 
office space; it includes subleases as well as direct leases. 
</P>
<P>
 If tenant activity this year continues at 1993 levels and there is little 
construction, the office vacancy rate could go as low as 16.5% by the end of 
this year, said Tom Fillmore, research director for Grubb & Ellis.  
</P>
<P>
 The credit crunch -- a reluctance by lenders to fund new projects -- is a 
major factor hindering the construction of office buildings, and that is likely 
to continue for at least two more years, Riddle said. Also, some large 
financial institutions are still trying to get rid of real estate inherited 
through mergers, bankruptcies and foreclosures, so they will continue to sell 
office properties on the cheap. That, too, will discourage new development, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 1.3 million square feet of office space was absorbed in Orange 
County, up from the 918,917 square feet of absorption for 1992. (Absorption is 
the net increase in the amount of occupied office space.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the retail market, the story was different. The closure of eight Builders 
Emporium sites in Orange County added more than 300,000 square feet of empty 
store space. That resulted in a negative absorption of 51,653 square feet of 
retail space for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Grubb & Ellis brokers expressed optimism that the retail market will be 
healthy this year, citing interest by major retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is still the glamour market for retailers," said Greg 
Mickelson, a retail broker for Grubb & Ellis in Newport Beach. "They are going 
to continue to come to town." Vacancy Rates Retreat 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's commercial real estate vacancy rates for 1993 decreased in all 
categories except retail space, which increased to 6.3% from 5.2% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing, distribution, 1993: 15.3% 
</P>
<P>
 Office, 1993: 18.1% 
</P>
<P>
 Research, development, 1993 15.8% 
</P>
<P>
 Note: 1989-91 vacancy rate not available for retail spasce.

 Orange Coast magazine promised that its January issue would depict a local 
personality with clothes off. But those who considered that a promise of nudity 
were too hasty, said the magazine's publisher, Ruth Ko. 
</P>
<P>
 The new issue shows Carol Humphreys, society editor for the Orange County 
Register, with clothes off -- but bathing suit on. In an accompanying article, 
Humphreys discusses such weighty topics as her favorite time of day. (It's 
sunset.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ko said the feature is an attempt to highlight people's sensuous -- and not 
necessarily sexual -- facets. "There are enough photos of Marion Bergeson or 
Kathryn Thompson behind a desk," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Humphreys: "I had to think about it first; but it was fun, and I thought 
it was tastefully done." 
</P>
<P>
 Who's up for February? Ko is not saying. You'll have to buy the magazine, she 
said, which is exactly the point.

'93 HOME SALES IN O.C. UP 11.9%, SIGNALING TURNAROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A surge of late-winter buying pushed Orange County's home sales for 1993 
almost 12% ahead of those for the previous year. And December -- typically one 
of the slowest months of the year -- accounted for the highest number of sales 
in 31 months, a real estate data firm reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new figures from Dataquick Information Systems in San Diego support what 
real estate professionals have been saying for several months: The housing 
market, on the decline since early in 1990, seems to have turned around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't a return to boom times, but things are gradually improving," said 
Fountain Valley realtor James Righeimer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dataquick, 28,878 homes and condominiums changed hands in Orange 
County last year. Though that total, which included resales as well as new 
units, was among the smallest since the 1981-82 recession, it represented an 
11.9% increase from 25,807 sales for 1992. Dataquick counts sales recorded each 
month with the county Recorder's Office but excludes transactions such as 
transfers to trusts. 
</P>
<P>
 December's 3,176 sales were the most since May, 1991, and were up 27.9% from 
2,483 transactions for December, 1992, said John Karevoll, a Dataquick analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW-Redi Property Data, a Riverside-based real estate information company, 
will release its annual tally of Orange County home sales next week. Those 
figures are also expected to show 1993 as a turnaround year. Because it uses a 
slightly different criteria and counts more transactions than Dataquick, TRW 
analyst Nima Nattagh said the company's tally will put home sales in the county 
last year over the 30,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's report from Dataquick showed the median housing price -- the point 
at which half of transactions were higher and half lower -- at $200,500, down 
from a median of $210,500 for 1992. A major reason for that decline of nearly 
5% is that the '93 market was dominated by smaller homes priced for the 
first-time buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the so-called affordability of housing in Orange County reached 
near-record levels in 1993, opening up home ownership to many people who had 
been relegated to renter status.  
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Campos, a realtor with Century 21 Casa Grande Realty in Santa Ana, 
said that sales to first-time buyers in the Latino community have soared in the 
past three months as falling prices, low interest rates and more liberal 
standards for government-guaranteed loans have created opportunities for 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of a three-bedroom home in Santa Ana, he said, has dropped 
from $190,000 to $160,000 in the past year.

GREAT PACIFIC REIT PLANS TO GO PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Great Pacific Real Estate Investment Trust in Newport Beach expects to go 
public with a $20-million stock offering sometime in mid-February, company 
spokesman John W. Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Pacific, which filed an REIT prospectus in September with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, plans to make construction loans for affordable 
housing projects in California, Nevada, Arizona and other Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had originally proposed a $15-million to $25-million offering. But 
in an amended stock filing this week, the company said Baraban Securities in 
Los Angeles has agreed to underwrite a $20-million offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Pacific is a mortgage REIT and operates somewhat like a bank. It sells 
investors shares of ownership and then invests in construction loans, but not 
the underlying real estate, which is the case in an equity REIT. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Dangelo, company president, announced that Great Pacific's first three 
housing developments are: Whitehawk Palm Desert, a 288-home development near 
Palm Desert, with houses priced as low as $165,000; Evolutions at Vail Ranch, a 
Temecula development with 187 houses priced from $108,500 to $153,000; and 
Rancho California, a Temecula development with 170 homes priced as low as 
$150,000.

 Jim deYong, the "d" in dGWB, is heading into semi-retirement next week at the 
tender age of 45. The executive vice president of the award-winning Irvine ad 
agency will take on a role akin to permanent consultant and a tongue-in-cheek 
title of chairman emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
 deYong said he plans to travel to Central America, build a home in Dana Point, 
learn to golf and chip away at a list of about 50 things he's always wanted to 
do. A self-described workaholic, deYong has built three ad agencies in Orange 
County since 1976. He has been weaning himself from his role in new business 
development for about two years, he said, and he is proud to be leaving the 
agency on a high note, competing for business with such international 
heavyweights as Ketchum Advertising and Backer Spielvogel Bates.

 "It's a lot more fun batting in the big leagues," said the San Juan Capistrano

 Clothestime Inc.'s purchase of 480 Southern California billboards for the 
pre-Christmas season didn't push sales over last year's figures, the retailer 
said recently.It posted a 4% drop in same-store sales nationwide in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The purveyor of women's clothing is still chipper about the billboards, 
however, which were the biggest outdoor media buy in Southern California 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably would have had less sales in Southern California without the 
billboards," said company spokeswoman Jane Whaley. "We felt good about the 
promotion. We got a lot of calls and comments."

TOKOS MEDICAL TO LAY OFF 200 WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tokos Medical Corp. plans to consolidate centers providing certain services 
and lay off 200 employees nationwide, although the job losses in Orange County 
will be offset by gains in other areas, executives said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokos plans to consolidate its telemedical services, in which staff members 
speak directly with patients to educate them about the company's products. It 
also plans to eliminate its manufacturing operations and contract out that 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The job losses in those areas will be offset in Orange County by bringing 
people from other units to the company's Santa Ana headquarters, said chief 
financial officer Nicholas A. Mione. Nationwide, the 200 positions being 
eliminated represent about 10% of the company's total work force.

TACO BELL DENIES ALLEGATIONS IN SUIT THAT IT SPIED ON CHICAGO FRANCHISEE 
</P>

<P>
 Taco Bell Corp. on Thursday denied allegations that it tried to infiltrate a 
Chicago-based company in 1991 to spy on a fast-food franchisee. 
</P>
<P>
 In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, franchisee Richard L. Cohn 
alleges that Taco Bell tried to gain access to his company illegally in 1991 by 
recommending that he hire a Houston-based Taco Bell executive to help run nine 
Chicago-area franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Cohn hired Dirk Smith, who subsequently taped and made 
notes of confidential conversations with Cohn, including talk of possible 
litigation against Taco Bell. Cohn's suit, filed in August, alleges that the 
illegal activities were part of a plan by Taco Bell to push him out of the 
Chicago market. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell Vice President Jonathan Blum on Thursday said that the allegations 
of corporate spying are "absolutely and unequivocally false. . . . Taco Bell 
doesn't condone the use of such tactics, nor do we use them in any of our 
restaurants or operations." 
</P>
<P>
 "Taco Bell has flourished . . . by building on a foundation of the highest and 
soundest business practices," Blum said. "We will vigorously defend against 
these charges through the judicial system." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who now owns a fast-food company in Houston, on Thursday denied spying 
on Cohn for Taco Bell. Smith acknowledged that he had taped some conversations 
with Cohn but said he did so as part of his attempt to prove that the Chicago 
businessman reneged on a promised compensation package. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kohn hired me, offered me a lot to come to work . . . and then he retracted 
everything," Smith said. "Cohn absolutely knows that what he's accusing me of 
is false," he said, adding that he was angry and that led him to record the 
conversations.  
</P>
<P>
 Cohn's bid to prove that Taco Bell wanted to force him out of business in 
Chicago suffered a setback earlier this month when a U.S. District Court judge 
dismissed a charge that Taco Bell illegally encroached on Cohn's sales 
territory. The judge ruled that Cohn's franchise agreement did not prohibit 
Taco Bell from opening restaurants near his.

WESTERN DIGITAL SHOWS PROFIT AFTER TWO QUARTERS IN THE RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Western Digital Corp., which had losses for the two previous quarters, said 
Thursday that it rebounded in the latest period to post a profit of $12.5 
million, or 32 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 That was nearly double the computer disk drive maker's earnings of $6.9 
million, or 22 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. Revenue for 
the company's second fiscal quarter, which ended Dec. 25, was $371.1 million, 
up 8% from $343.5 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Irvine, said the rebound to profitability in the second 
quarter was because of increased sales in its disk drive business, which 
typically accounts for 85% of its revenue. It also follows a period of cost 
cutting that was capped with an announcement in October that Motorola Inc. 
would buy Western Digital's semiconductor manufacturing plant in a $115-million 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Western Digital shares 
gained 67 cents to close at $12.75. 
</P>
<P>
 James A. Stone, an analyst who follows Western Digital for Pennsylvania 
Merchant Group in Philadelphia, said the earnings report shows clearly that the 
company is "well on the way to recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 "The electronics business is still holding them back, but they are emerging as 
a strong contender in the disk market. Unit sales were up 20%, and margins 
improved significantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said that Western Digital, too, is a leader in making its products less 
expensive by applying some of the most advanced manufacturing techniques. He 
said the outlook is good for personal computer sales, and that should ensure 
continued demand for disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half of its fiscal year, Western Digital reported a profit of 
$7.4 million, or 20 cents a share, down 33% from $11.1 million, or 36 cents a 
share, for the same period a year earlier. Six-month revenue was $656.6 
million, up 6.8% from $614.6 million. Profitable Second Quarter 
</P>
<P>
 In its second quarter ended Dec. 25, Western Digital posted a profit of $12.5 
million, or 32 cents per share, on revenue of $371.1 million. Figures in 
millions of dollars, except per-share data: 05,19,09,09,10,10 2nd qtr 2nd qtr 6

DANA PARSONS: AS A SYMBOL OF WHAT WAS, THE DUKE STILL LOOMS LARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For no apparent reason on this otherwise dreamlike Orange County day, I have 
John Wayne in my head. Sheesh, I've only lived here seven years and already I'm 
nostalgic for an Orange County I never even knew. 
</P>
<P>
 I bet my shrink probably would tell me I'm overloaded on names like Fleiss, 
Menendez, Bobbitt. They're taking up way too much space in my consciousness. I 
don't care about any of them, and yet I can't get away from them. Or their 
problems. They and various permutations of them are dominating the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 You think I'm going crazy? You are correct, sir. 
</P>
<P>
 Give me shelter from the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Give me the Orange County when the big guy would walk around Newport Beach and 
yet not be gawked at, or expect to be gawked at. Give me something, anything -- 
at least for a day or so -- that harks back to a time when we didn't celebrate 
superficiality, victimization and sociological oddities. 
</P>
<P>
 Give me the Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tribute to American myth making (either that, or how far I've declined 
psychologically) that I wasn't even a John Wayne fan when he was alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I miss the big galoot. 
</P>
<P>
 I miss his commonness, his raw honesty, his unapologetic insistence on being 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Come June, the Duke will have been dead 15 years. He died of cancer at 72, 15 
years after it was first detected in him. 
</P>
<P>
 When he died, Times Staff Writer Robert Kistler wrote of Wayne: "He was, like 
one of those giant faces on Mount Rushmore, a larger-than-life reminder of the 
nation's heritage, as well as a living example of its once-celebrated, 
rough-and-tumble pioneer spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 While thinking of Wayne, I wondered whether anyone else gives much thought to 
the Duke anymore. I ventured down to the Class of '47 tavern in Balboa, a 
hole-in-the-wall saloon where the Duke used to saunter in, have a couple 
drinks, and saunter out. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Dominic Restivo has numerous photos of the Duke adorning the walls, 
along with other old-timers like Bogie, Marilyn and Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came in periodically," Restivo said. "It was no big deal. He'd come in, 
drink. When he was kind of sick, he'd come in, get a Scotch and milk. It was 
just a natural thing. It was like when one of those big football players would 
come in. He came in here once with James Arness." 
</P>
<P>
 Restivo makes it humorously clear he wasn't overly impressed with stars. "I 
didn't think it was that big a deal. After he died, they flew the flags at half 
mast. There are plenty of celebrities who live around here." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Restivo if anyone asks about the Duke anymore. "The younger 
generation, they ask a lot of questions about him. I'm 65. People my age, it's 
history to them. In my day, we could give a (bleep) who it was. To us, they 
were (just) movie stars. What's he done? He made a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Restivo why the younger generation seems more interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got no idea," he said. "Young kids are asking questions about him all the 
time. Just stupid stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 One tribute to Wayne's popularity is that pictures of him keep disappearing 
from the bar, Restivo said. "They take 'em right off the wall, screws and 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 How is that possible, I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Easy, when you got one bartender and he's half asleep. I had one old picture 
of him, it looked like he was looking down right over you. I came in one day 
and it was gone and I asked the bartender, 'What the (bleep) happened to that 
picture?' "He said, 'I didn't notice it was missing.' I said, 'How could you 
not notice it? (Wayne) was looking right over you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne spent the last 15 years of his life in Newport Beach. He told former 
Times staffer Joseph Bell that Orange County offered everything he needed to be 
happy. Although Wayne would be subject to autograph seekers if he went out for 
an evening, he didn't let his celebrity greatly restrict his movements. 
</P>
<P>
 "People around home don't hassle me," he once said. "They mostly respect my 
privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose one reason I miss the Duke is because it is increasingly clear how 
much he stands in contrast to the world he left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 He was never trivial, never phony, never whiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh God, if we could only snap our fingers and make that the norm today. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Wayne foresaw that his popularity would linger with young people even 
after his death, because he once told Bell: 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I see of the world today, the kids could use a few heroes. Even our 
sports pages are full of guys who refuse to report for practice or get busted 
or jump out of bushes at little girls. I don't know where the kids are going to 
turn for heroes anymore."

AMPHITHEATER AND NEIGHBORS NEAR SETTLEMENT; COURTS: 10-YEAR LEGAL BATTLE OVER 
CONCERT NOISE AT COSTA MESA VENUE MAY END WITH OPERATORS' ASSURANCE THEY'LL 
HOLD IT DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a contentious 10-year legal battle over loud music, the Pacific 
Amphitheatre and its residential neighbors may be calling a truce. 
</P>
<P>
 The amphitheater's current operators have given assurances that sound from the 
venue will not exceed set levels, according to a tentative settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 And the former operators have agreed to give free tickets to about 6,000 
families within a mile of the Pacific Amphitheatre. Those tickets will be good 
for shows at other facilities the company now runs, including the Arrowhead 
Pond at Anaheim and the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will go before Orange County Superior Court Judge James R. Ross 
on Feb. 2 for final review, said attorney Richard L. Spix, who represents 39 
homeowners in the case. If approved, the settlement is expected to end the 
courtroom tug-of-war between homeowners and various groups that have run the 
amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relatively pleased with the terms of the settlement," Spix said. "Whoever 
owns (the amphitheater) will have to live by the restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Noel Hatch, lawyer for the Pacific Amphitheatre Partnership, said he hopes the 
settlement will bring "peace in our time." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal dispute began in 1984 when a homeowner who lived 2,300 feet from the 
amphitheater filed a lawsuit against Ned West Inc., which then owned the venue, 
contending that loud music violated Orange County's noise ordinance. Under that 
law, the average noise level permissible in residential areas during the 
daytime is 50 decibels. 
</P>
<P>
 That case was resolved when a judge later allowed the amphiteater to emit 
noise averaging 55 decibels, as measured at the resident's house, Spix said.  
</P>
<P>
 For comparison, noise from "early morning back yard crickets range from 38 to 
44 decibels," Spix explained, and the sound of "a jet airplane flying 100 feet 
above you is about 110 decibels." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents were upset when noise from the amphitheater continued, Spix 
said. In March of 1990, 39 residents from the Mesa del Mar neighborhood north 
of the amphitheater sued Ned West, the music promoters who operated the 
amphitheater at the time. Each resident asked for $25,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate dispute, the amphitheater's owners later sued the Orange County 
Fairgrounds for loss of a concert during the county fair's run. The 
amphitheater leases land from the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 judgment in that case required that the amphitheater owners sell the 
facility to the state of California, and that whoever operated it keep noise at 
a stricter level, based on locations inside the amphitheater. It is currently 
owned by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Spix said the tentative settlement involving 39 homeowners was drawn up in 
December and includes provisions that allow the residents to take any noise 
complaints to a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, the amphitheater partnership also will reimburse the 
homeowners for $250,000 in legal fees and other costs, Spix said.  
</P>
<P>
 The occupants of about 6,000 households will receive four tickets to upcoming 
events at other venues, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Pacific Amphitheatre Partnership pledged never to own the 
facility again, attorneys said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it is a very positive thing for the whole community," Hatch said. "We 
think it will end the animosity that seems to have existed out there over the 
years."

HELMET SAVES YOUNG BICYCLIST FROM SERIOUS INJURY IN COLLISION; ACCIDENT: 
HUNTINGTON BEACH GIRL IS AMONG FIRST TO BENEFIT FROM NEW STATE LAW REQUIRING 
MINORS TO WEAR PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR WHILE RIDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Marcia White knows firsthand what can happen to bicyclists who refuse to wear 
a helmet because they think it may not be "cool." 
</P>
<P>
 A helmet saved the 11-year-old from serious injury or worse when she collided 
with a car while riding home from school Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's stupid not to" wear a helmet, the sixth-grader said Thursday. "They can 
definitely save your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia, a student at Isaac L. Sowers Middle School, was a block from her home 
when the accident occurred. She was thrown onto the hood of the car as it 
slowed for a stop sign. The impact was so great that her helmet shattered the 
windshield, Police Lt. Chuck Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngster was hurled to the ground and struck her head on the pavement. 
The helmet cracked, but Marcia was spared. 
</P>
<P>
 "The helmet saved her from serious injury," said Fire Capt. Bob Filipek, whose 
engine company paramedics treated Marcia. "Bottom line: It saved her a lot of 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics stabilized Marcia's back and neck and took her by ambulance to Hoag 
Hospital in Newport Beach, where she was treated and released. She returned to 
school the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia is among the first children saved from serious injury since a new state 
law requiring minors to wear helmets while cycling went into effect Jan. 1, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Carey, a Huntington Beach City School District trustee and a neighbor 
of Marcia's, said the girl has been wearing her helmet "religiously."  
</P>
<P>
 "She is a real good role model for others resisting the new law because they 
feel that helmets aren't cool or because it musses their hair," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sowers Principal Paul R. Morrow said Marcia became the center of attention 
when she returned to school Wednesday and showed friends her Sportech helmet 
"with a big crack down the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the helmet, we probably wouldn't have her with us," Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow said that of the approximately 600 Sowers students who ride bicycles to 
school, he's only had to talk to about 10 or 15 who refused to wear helmets. 
The school district has a mandatory helmet policy, which also went into effect 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them, 'You walk or you wear a helmet,' " Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia said her accident happened while she was crossing Sprit Circle in her 
neighborhood. Two vans were parked on the street and blocked her visibility, 
she said, and she failed to see the oncoming car.  
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't stop in time and we collided," she said. "I was scared. It (the 
helmet) saved my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia's mother, Norma White, said there's little question that the helmet 
saved her daughter from serious injury. "She could have had a concussion or be 
in a coma. It would have been really, really serious complications or maybe 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, White said she has concerns that the helmet sustained such extensive 
damage from the impact with the slow-moving car. She said she plans to talk 
with the Parent-Teacher-Student organization that supplies the helmets to see 
if they should be more durable. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she paid about $20 for the Marcia's helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Coalition for Children's Safety and Health said bicycle-related 
crashes are the No. 1 cause of death and brain injury among children between 
the ages of 5 and 14. Nearly 18,000 children statewide were treated in 
emergency rooms in 1991 because of bicycle-related head injuries. About half of 
the 138 people who died of bicycle injuries statewide in 1991 were children. 
</P>
<P>
 The new state law applies to bicycle riders under age 18. In the first year, 
violators will get only warnings from police. Starting in 1995, violators or 
their parents will be fined up to $25 for each offense.

TOMATO CROP FACES VIRUS PERIL; AGRICULTURE: DISEASE CARRIED BY PEST HAS 
AFFECTED MUCH OF THE COUNTY'S YIELD AND ALL OF IRVINE'S. A USDA OFFICIAL FEARS 
IT COULD SPREAD TO OTHER PRODUCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County's $17-million tomato industry is threatened by a new and 
"extremely serious" virus that has destroyed much of the county's recent crop, 
officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to researchers, the disease is transmitted by a nutrient-sucking 
insect called the greenhouse whitefly and currently has "affected 100% of the 
(tomato) crops in the Irvine area." 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, growers in Irvine contacted the USDA after their crops started to 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
 James E. Duffus, a USDA plant pathologist, said preliminary information has 
shown that the new, previously unidentified virus can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most destructive diseases for tomato crops occurring in 
the state," Duffus said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the new virus is similar to a virus that has caused severe damage to 
desert lettuce and sugar beet crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffus presented his findings Thursday at a conference of California produce 
growers in San Francisco. He told them he was concerned about the disease's 
"potential to spread" to other tomato-farming regions throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 California is the nation's No. 1 producer of tomatoes. In Orange County, they 
grow on more than 1,700 acres of farmland and are the third most valuable crop, 
behind flowers and strawberries but ahead of oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Wood, a USDA spokeswoman, said the virus has already "induced severe 
crop losses" in Orange County. No other region seems to be affected by the new 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffus said that at least one Orange County farm has stopped growing tomatoes 
because of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're afraid to start growing again," Duffus said. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial toll the virus has caused in Orange County is not yet known, 
Duffus said. No local growers could be reached for comment Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffus said the disease causes yellowing, decay and death of the plant. He 
said it is possible that the disease could infect other crops in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking into that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers also are studying ways to control the spread of the virus. 
Although pesticides might work, Duffus said he hopes to find an environmentally 
safe alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 If the virus is not controlled, it could "force the abandonment" of Irvine as 
a tomato-producing area, he said, adding that it could be several years before 
an "antiserum" is found to defeat the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we just don't know a whole heck of a lot about this virus," 
Duffus said. 
</P>

 The most important thing right now, Duffus said, is to discover the source of 
the virus that the pest carries. Once the source is isolated, "than maybe we 
can eliminate it as a problem," he said.

CULTURAL COLLAGE; MURAL IS REMINDER OF CAMPAIGN FOR ASIAN STUDIES COURSES AT 
UCI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A dragon and a phoenix fly at each other, brilliant in green and gold. A 
Hawaiian laborer gathers sugar cane. Japanese American soldiers prove their 
patriotism in World War II as their families wait in internment camps. A 
Chinese immigrant labors on an American railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Mar's 5-by-15-foot mural depicting images of Asian American history -- 
inspired by a student campaign for more Asian studies courses -- is finally 
completed and ready to be installed at UC Irvine's Cross-Cultural Center more 
than two years after Mar began it as an undergraduate in 1991. A dedication 
ceremony is scheduled today.  
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like a homecoming," said Corina A. Espinoza, director of UCI's 
Cross-Cultural Center. "It's coming home." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Mar, a 1991 UCI graduate who is now pursuing a master's degree in Asian 
American studies at UCLA: "It's supposed to be very accessible, a collage of 
various Asian American histories." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer and fall, Mar displayed the mural to classes and community groups 
at UCLA, UC Riverside, Cerritos Community College and elsewhere. The mural is 
his first painting, he said, adding that suggestions from participants in 
workshops on art, politics and cultural heritage helped shape the final 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a collaborative effort," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the mural grew out of campus activism in 1991, when students at 
UCI began to intensify their demands for more courses in Asian studies. 
Inspired by a mural in the office of a campus Latino organization, Asian 
students decided they needed one "to represent what we were fighting for," said 
junior Eileen Chun, president of the Asian Pacific Student Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Mar, then artistic director for Rice Paper, the campus's alternative Asian 
magazine, agreed to do the mural. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always the budding artist," Chun recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural started out almost as a personal project, Mar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My great-grandfather worked on the railroads," he said. "At first, (the 
mural) was just me." 
</P>
<P>
 Mar said he originally drew an image of Frank Chin, a controversial Asian 
American playwright who inspired him. But when fellow students at UCI and later 
at UCLA responded to the work in progress, "it changed the content of the 
piece," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to student input, Mar took out the Chin image, and added others 
such as Hawaiian and Filipino laborers. And some of the images of Asian 
Americans became less specific. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are not explicitly one race or another," he said. "I'm now trying 
to portray an egalitarian notion of Asian American history." 
</P>
<P>
 John Liu, an ethnic studies professor who will speak at the dedication 
ceremony, believes the mural represents all Asian Americans. "What we're 
talking about is a manifestation of an emerging Asian American culture, not 
just a Chinese culture, or Japanese, or Korean. . . . The mural, in a sense, 
represents some of the changes Asian Americans have gone through." 
</P>
<P>
 Chun sees the mural as political art and as a reminder of the student campaign 
for Asian studies courses, which culminated in a hunger strike last year that 
led to UCI's agreement to hire more professors and add more courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students made Asian American history," she said. "You don't hear much about 
Asians voicing anger at the institution."  
</P>
<P>
 Having the large mural hanging permanently at UCI for students to see daily 
will serve as a symbol and a reminder of that campaign, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was well worth the wait."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; MAN IS HELD AFTER ARGUMENT, STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was arrested Thursday on suspicion of stabbing a friend during an 
argument, police said. The latter was not seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Kyle Terry, 23, was arguing with Dennis Dodier, 30, both of Westminster, 
in the 7200 block of Wyoming Street about 1:25 p.m. Thursday, Lt. Mike Chliskey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodier then started to choke Terry, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had been friends, but the one being choked . . . pulled out a 
pocketknife and stabbed the other one three times in the back and one time in 
the neck," Chliskey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodier got away, ran outside and called police officers, who were in the area 
on a separate investigation, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodier was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange for treatment of superficial 
knife wounds and later released, Chliskey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry was being held at Orange County Jail.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; HOSPITAL ASKS COASTAL PANEL TO DELAY VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoag Hospital officials have asked the California Coastal Commission to delay 
consideration of the hospital's long-range expansion plans until next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial proposal to construct hospital facilities on about two acres 
of cattail-choked wetland near Coast Highway has generated opposition from the 
planning staff at the Coastal Commission, which has recommended that the full 
commission reject the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were shocked at the staff recommendation to deny this project," said Peter 
Foulke, senior vice president at Hoag Hospital. As a result, the hospital asked 
the Coastal Commission on Tuesday to delay consideration of the blueprint for 
the future expansion of the hospital. The panel was scheduled to vote on it at 
its Tuesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Foulke said the hospital is not planning to change the plan before next 
month's hearing but will try "a different approach" in the way it is presented 
in the hope the commissioners will approve it. The project was approved 
unanimously by the Newport Beach City Council in May, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan sets the parameters for the expansion of Hoag Hospital into a 
regional medical center within the next 25 years. Though the plan does not lay 
out specific building designs and functions, it does outline building size and 
density. The estimated cost of creating the medical center has not been 
determined.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; '90S FISCAL POLICY CALLS FOR CITY CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON and SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has entered what officials call a new era in municipal management 
with the adoption of a business strategy to guide fiscal policy into the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, adopted this week as the city faces a $4.5-million budget shortfall, 
calls for sharp reductions in city staffing as well as cost-cutting measures 
that will affect such things as the length of City Council meetings and the 
hours City Hall is open. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the plan is necessary to meet the challenges of a sluggish 
economy, which has reduced city revenue from development fees and the sales 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us a road map for the rest of the decade," said City Manager Paul 
O. Brady Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The council dissected the business plan at a Tuesday night meeting that lasted 
until midnight. Though council members did not embrace all suggestions, many 
key proposals were adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seventy-one city positions will be eliminated, including 10 manager jobs. 
About 53 employees will leave voluntarily as part of an early retirement 
program. From 10 to 30 workers will be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beginning in March, City Hall will be closed on alternating Fridays. The 
schedule will be similar to the one used by Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * The current format of holding separate afternoon and evening City Council 
sessions will be scrapped. Instead, the council will meet in one session 
beginning at 5:30 p.m. The move is expected to reduce the amount of overtime 
paid to city workers who must attend the meetings. Council members said they 
hope to continue holding hearings of public concern later in the evening so 
that residents who work can attend. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city will look for ways to privatize city services and rely less on 
full-time city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * The council will examine possible cuts in some city services. Council 
members on Tuesday agreed to stop having the city provide them with meals 
during council meetings, at a savings of $6,000 annually. Adjustments in some 
city fees also will be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city will look at renting out some municipal facilities, including 
portions of the corporation yard and multi-services center, to private firms 
and groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will make specific decisions on many of these issues in the coming 
months as it grapples with the 1994-95 fiscal year budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan seeks to address the sluggish state of Irvine's once-booming economy. 
"You don't do business today in the way you did in the 1980s," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members expressed regret about having to lay off workers, but 
all agreed that the cutbacks were necessary for the long-term fiscal health of 
the city. Irvine Cost Cutting 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine City Council this week approved a business strategy designed to 
guide fiscal policy for the next decade. Cost-cutting measures outlined in the 
plan include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Privatizing some city services 
</P>
<P>
 * Reducing the number of city commissions and committees 
</P>
<P>
 * Renting city facilities to private groups 
</P>
<P>
 * Adjusting city fees 
</P>
<P>
 * Reducing some city services 
</P>
<P>
 * Cutting City Hall business hours

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CITY APPROVES COSTCO DEVELOPMENT PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week approved final terms of a development agreement 
that will allow the Costco Wholesale Corp. membership store to move to a larger 
location on a 13 1/2-acre parcel that the Agency for Community Development owns 
near the Garden Grove Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Tuesday approved on a 4-1 vote final development fees totaling 
$695,000 for the move from the store's current location at 11822 Gilbert St. 
Officials said, however, that more than half the development fees imposed this 
week will be reimbursed to Costco by the Agency for Community Development, the 
city's redevelopment agency, after the store opens. 
</P>
<P>
 Costco officials plan to construct a 156,000-square-foot building on land 
south of Garden Grove Boulevard and west of Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The future Costco store will include new and expanded services such as a 
pharmacy, deli, nursery sales and a tire service center. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that Costco will double annual sales because it will 
be near the freeway and is expected to increase its regional drawing power. 
This would result in annual sales tax revenue to the city of $540,000 in the 
third year of operation and approximately $13 million over 20 years, according 
to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials predict that the center will produce 50 to 75 full- and part-time 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has spent about $9.9 million to buy lots and clear the site for the 
new store. But the net cost, because the city is trading for the land that 
Costco owns at its current location, is $6.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert F. Dinsen cast the only vote against the agreement, claiming 
the agency is paying too high a subsidy for the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Leyes said that Costco officials needed a bigger store with 
more visibility to compete with rival stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Costco will continue operations at its current site during construction. 
Costco will pay rent of $29,167 a month to the agency for community development 
until leaving the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The main entry and exit for the new store will be at Garden Grove Boulevard 
and Main Street.ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; 3 BUS STOPS RESTORED AFTER COMPLAINTS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After protests by senior citizens, the City Council has voted to restore three 
bus stops that were recently canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The three stops at the intersection of Glassell Street and Almond Avenue were 
discontinued the first week of December after the Orange County Transportation 
Authority rerouted bus lines to facilitate access to the city's new commuter 
rail facility, which opened Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 However, scores of senior citizens complained to the council that the 
terminations caused hardships by greatly increasing the walking distance to 
other bus stops. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expect the three bus stops on Route 53, 59 and 69 to resume 
operation by today. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; FIRE OFFICIAL NAMED TO VALLEJO CHIEF POST 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A top Fire Department administrator has been named fire chief of a Northern 
California city. 
</P>
<P>
 Division Chief Steve Magliocco, who runs the department's business affairs, 
will become Vallejo's fire chief next month.Vallejo, on the east side of the 
San Francisco Bay, has about 120,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Magliocco, 44, is a 20-year member of the department, having begun as a 
firefighter. He was one of the city's first paramedics in 1976. He was promoted 
to captain in 1982 and battalion chief in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 A 33-year resident of the city, he is a graduate of Servite High School and UC 
Irvine. He is married and has four children. 
</P>
<P>
 Magliocco credited Anaheim Chief Jeff Bowman for getting him ready for his new 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chief Bowman rotates us through the key staff positions, giving us kind of a 
taste of what it's like to do his job," Magliocco said. "Unfortunately, Chief 
Bowman is younger than I am, and I like him too much to run him over with my 
car. So if I want to be a chief, it means I have to go elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman said: "Steve's considerable experience and knowledge will be a loss for 
the city and its residents, but I am sure he will continue to make many 
positive contributions to fire services as chief in Vallejo." 
</P>
<P>
 No replacement for Magliocco has been named.TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY REJECTS UNOCAL'S BID TO REOPEN PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to the protests of residents, the City Council has rejected Unocal's 
bid to reopen an oil-water separation plant on Marina Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous decision came Monday night during a meeting packed with more 
than 100 residents, nearly all of whom opposed Unocal's proposal out of fear 
that the plant would emit pollutants into their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old plant has been closed since 1983, when winter storms destroyed 
the offshore wells that fed into the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents who have moved into the neighborhood over the past 11 years 
argued that the plant is no longer compatible with the residential community. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant is next to Marina Park and near a preschool and the River Beach 
condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one time, Unocal fit in with the community," said resident Galen Ambrose. 
"Now we are a bedroom community." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents said the plant would emit cancer-causing substances as well as 
fumes that cause nose and eye irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal officials have long denied that the plant poses any health risks. 
</P>
<P>
 They said that studies of a similar oil-water separation plant in Huntington 
Beach found that the air quality outside the facility and inside nearby homes 
did not change when the plant was operating. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members sided with the residents, saying they didn't want to take 
the risk of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Safety was the No. 1 issue," said Councilman George Brown. "I thought about 
the kids playing down there in the park (by the plant). I just didn't think it 
was compatible" with the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal officials expressed disappointment at the council vote, which reverses 
an earlier decision by the Planning Commission to allow the plant to begin 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this would be a safe plant," said Unocal spokeswoman Janet 
McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
 The company now hopes to move the oil-water operation to a platform 
offshore.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; GRAND JURY REPORT TACKLES DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Answering criticism that it's out of touch with the county's ethnic minority 
population, the Orange County Grand Jury has issued a report suggesting ways it 
can improve its diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 The report focuses on ways to increase publicity and recruitment efforts while 
also assuring fairness in the investigative portion of applicant screening. 
</P>
<P>
 The report comes just before the Jan. 28 deadline for applicants interested in 
serving on next year's panel. The grand jury is a 19-member, independent panel 
of citizens that can bring charges against defendants in criminal 
investigations and acts as a government watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-page document recommends that county officials highlight the need 
for more members by continuing to designate November as "Grand Jury Awareness 
Month," along with a promotional campaign using posters, brochures and flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The outreach program described by the report also mentions using public 
service announcements on cable television and radio, sending follow-up letters 
to civic groups and creating an "open door policy" to invite input on grand 
jury issues from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have charged that the panel does not reflect Orange County's 
increasingly diverse demographics. Of the 89 applicants considered for the 
current jury, 80 of them were white. About two-thirds were male. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is 65% white, 23% Latino, 10% Asian and 2% African American. 
</P>
<P>
 Bahia Wilson, chairwoman of the jury's special issues committee, said the new 
measures hopefully will draw a larger pool of candidates reflecting different 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we talk about diversity, we're talking about gender, age and cultural 
heritage," Wilson said. "When you have that, you have a broader sensitivity 
toward issues that might be coming before the grand jury." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury's makeup has increasingly come under fire in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys in the Stuart A. Tay murder trial are seeking to quash 
indictments handed down by the grand jury, based on a lack of minority 
representation. A population expert testified in the case last month that the 
county grand jury has a "systematic exclusion" of Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days before that testimony, a U.S. Civil Rights Commission panel 
convened in Orange County to investigate complaints by Latino groups that they 
too are excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides attracting new applicants, the report addressed the process of 
screening prospective members. To ensure fairness, the Orange County Superior 
Court presiding judge and the grand jury's supervising judge should establish 
written, standard procedures for choosing the final 30 applicants, the report 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid a possible conflict of interest, the Orange County Marshal's Office 
should perform background checks on applicants instead of the district attorney 
doing it, jurors recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Background checks should not extend to visiting the homes of applicants, as it 
has in the past, jurors also wrote in the report. Written guidelines should be 
drafted for the background checks procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for applications to serve on the 1994-95 grand jury is Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 To receive an application or get more information, call the grand jury 
commissioner's hot line at (714) 834-6747. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TRABUCO CANYON; MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO MOLESTING 4 GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former stable handyman pleaded guilty Thursday to molesting four young girls 
and faces a possible six years in prison when he is sentenced later this month, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Ray Rowe, 48, of Trabuco Canyon befriended the girls' 
families and then molested the young girls when alone with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Nancy du Pont said Rowe was originally charged with two 
felony counts of lewd conduct with a child and two misdemeanor counts of child 
molestation involving two girls. 
</P>
<P>
 After further review, the misdemeanor charges were upgraded to felonies, and 
two new misdemeanor molestation charges were added when two more victims came 
forward, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All four girls are younger than 14, du Pont said. Deputy Public Defender Marri 
Derby, who is representing Rowe, could not be reached for comment late 
Thursday. Rowe is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 27 in Laguna Niguel Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The first molestation took place in Tustin in 1991 and involved a 12-year-old 
girl. Rowe persuaded the girl's parents to let him take her fishing, and 
molested her during the trip, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A complaint was made to the Orange County Sheriff's Department at that time, 
but no action was taken due to insufficient evidence, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowe was arrested after a second girl alleged that he molested her in 1993 
while visiting a Trabuco Canyon area stable to ride horses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that incident, Rowe undressed and forced the girl to fondle him, and also 
molested her, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said two more girls came forward after learning about the arrest.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MARINES GET LOOK AT HIGH-TECH HARDWARE

 Beneath the bang of F-16 Hornets bursting off a nearby runway, military 
contractors staffed booths Thursday in an empty hangar at the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station as they fielded questions from Marines about existing and 
soon-to-come hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 5,000 Marines expected to attend the two-day exposition in Hangar 296, 
it is a chance to learn more about equipment as well as offer firsthand advice 
to manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from some 50 companies, including Hughes Aircraft Co., 
Northrop Corp., Martin Marietta Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., answered 
questions about numerous products ranging from the $28-million V-22 Osprey 
helicopter to a $1,000 navigational device for ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here to maintain contact with the people who will be using our systems 
so we can better identify and address their needs," said Vincent Conroy of 
Rockwell International Corp.'s Hellfire missile division. 
</P>
<P>
 The missile, which was used extensively during the Persian Gulf War and weighs 
about 100 pounds, is a powerful weapon, said Maj. Russell Barnes, who is 
stationed at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barnes had a question: "Is the Hellfire missile limited to use by 
helicopters, or can it be adapted to be hand-carried?" 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy and Barnes discussed possibilities, with the businessman telling the 
warrior that he will pass the inquiry on to engineers at Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. H.C. Stackpole III, who is in charge of 80,000 Marines on the West 
Coast and in the Pacific, said that understanding and maximizing technology are 
more important now than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the difficulties we are facing during our current downsizing is as you 
get smaller, you must be more technologically proficient," Stackpole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the displays of high technology, it was a seemingly mundane machine that 
caught Gunnery Sgt. Ron Timmons' eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawaii-based Marine watched incredulously as a representative of Mini-Max 
Cleaners used a small hose to clean the internal parts of a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Timmons asked if the toaster-sized machine could clean a .50-caliber machine 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 When the representative said one person could clean the gun in half an hour 
with the Mini-Max, Timmons shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have three people spend two to three hours cleaning a 50-cal with hand 
brushes," the 18-year-veteran said, picking up brochures from the desk. "This 
thing is really great." E. J. GONG JR.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COUNTY TREASURER WILL SEEK REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, whose management of 
government revenues in lean fiscal times has won him praise from officials, 
said Thursday that he will seek a seventh term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written notice announcing his reelection bid, Citron, 68, stated that 
investments made by his office had generated $344 million for the county last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of those investment earnings will be used to fund a $2-million 
anti-gang strategy called TARGET that will send teams of police, prosecutors 
and probation officers into the county's most troubled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investment strategies and programs that have carried Orange County's 
annual interest rate on tax dollars to the highest levels in the state and the 
nation must be continued," Citron said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of this sound investment strategy, the people who pay taxes had their 
tax load lightened by tens of millions of dollars," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The treasurer's office manages an investment portfolio valued at $7.5 billion 
in taxes from 187 public agencies, including cities, school districts, special 
districts and county government.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY; HIGHWAY TOLLS TO BE FOREGONE IN DISASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Collection of tolls on the planned San Joaquin Hills tollway can be suspended 
during public safety emergencies such as the recent Laguna Canyon wildfire, 
because slowdowns at toll booths could delay the arrival of help or the 
evacuation of people in danger, officials decided Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to open in 1997, the $1.1-billion toll road will provide an expressway 
connection between the Corona del Mar Freeway near John Wayne Airport and 
Interstate 5 near San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 One-way tolls along the full length of the corridor are expected to be $2. 
</P>
<P>
 But if there is an emergency, "we do not want to make the situation worse than 
it already is" by making people slow down to pay the fare, said Lisa Telles, a 
spokesperson for the Transportation Corridor Agencies, which is building the 
six-lane tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency board unanimously 
approved the measure Thursday, giving the agency's chief executive officer 
authority to suspend fee collections, a decision that could be reached in less 
than 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The board that oversees the Foothill and Eastern tollway projects approved 
similar measures in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach fires in October focused attention on the need for an 
emergency toll policy. Telles said numerous traffic jams formed on smaller 
roads around Laguna when people were trying to flee the firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiving the tolls on a wider thoroughfare "would let people who are already 
concerned about their homes and their families" gain quicker mobility, Telles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17.5-mile tollway, intended to ease chronic traffic congestion problems in 
South County, has been the target of lawsuits and protests from environmental 
groups who say the project will destroy fragile wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, just days before construction work on the tollway was scheduled to 
begin, U. S. District Judge Linda McLaughlin temporarily halted construction 
work on a segment of the toll road pending a Jan. 24 hearing on the adequacy of 
the project's environmental impact studies. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin ruled that construction could only begin on the northern and 
southern ends of that road, where major development has already occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin recently postponed consideration of the tollway agency's argument 
that her injunction is no longer necessary since the October firestorm 
destroyed much of the habitat it was intended to protect. ELAINE TASSY

RAPISTS CAUGHT IN THE ACT, POLICE SAY; CRIME: WOMAN WAS BEING ASSAULTED IN 
BEACH RESTROOM AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN OFFICER ARRIVED IN RESPONSE TO TIP FROM A 
WITNESS. TWO SUSPECTS ARE HELD ON $50,000 BAIL. 
</P>

<P>
 Alerted by a witness, police arrested two men early Thursday as they allegedly 
were raping a 35-year-old Irvine woman in a beach restroom, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, who told police they were transients, were identified as Miguel 
Angel Lopez, 24, and Francisco Hernandez Ortega, 18. Both were booked into 
Orange County Jail on suspicion of rape with bail set at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Lance Ishmael, the principal investigator, said the attack occurred 
shortly after midnight on Crescent Bay Beach in north Laguna, the same beach 
where last July another woman was raped at gunpoint after dark and her 
boyfriend was bound and robbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishmael said police have made no arrests in the earlier rape, which is still 
under investigation. He said the two crimes are unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishmael credited Thursday's arrests to a witness who, after hearing the 
victim's screams and seeing her being attacked, hurried to a public telephone 
and called police. He said the first officer on the scene, Frank Farley, saw 
one man raping the woman in the restroom as the other man held her down. Farley 
then drew his gun and arrested the attackers, Ishmael said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishmael said that Lopez also is being charged with providing false information 
to authorities. Ishmael said a fingerprint search disclosed that Lopez 
originally gave police a false age and name. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was taken to South Coast Medical Center in Laguna Beach. She was 
treated for facial scratches and bruises and assigned a rape counselor before 
she was released. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. told him 
that the victim had been drinking on the beach with the two men who later 
followed her into the restroom and attacked her. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Barrett, president of the Crescent Bay Drive Homeowners Assn., said he 
was shocked to hear that a second rape had occurred on the cove beach abutting 
his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is outrageous that this is happening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett said after the July rape, his community had rejected the idea of 
placing a night curfew on the beach in the belief that such drastic action was 
unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett said he still opposes any curfew, contending that the rapes were 
"isolated incidents," but he suggested that other measures could be taken, such 
as locking the restrooms at night and increasing police patrols.  
</P>
<P>
 Barrett said individuals should avoid "throwing caution to the wind" by 
walking the beach after dark. The danger, he said, is a rather recent 
phenomenon: "Ten years ago I would never have thought twice of going down to 
the beach any time of day or night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishmael said police have no plans to step up beach patrols. But he also urged 
people to exercise prudence in nighttime. "Don't be alone in those dark places 
at those hours of the night, especially if you are a woman and alone," he said.

OVERTIME PROBE RILES FIREFIGHTERS; INVESTIGATION: WESTMINSTER COUNCIL 
INSTIGATED THE D.A. INQUIRY INTO FRAUD CHARGES IN A BID TO DISCREDIT UNION, 
OFFICIAL SAYS. COUNCIL MEMBERS INSIST PROBE IS JUSTIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's investigation into allegations of 
overtime fraud in the Westminster Fire Department was instigated by the City 
Council to discredit the firefighters union, a union official charged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They cannot say we're doing a bad job (as firefighters), so they have to 
picture us as greedy, self-centered people," said Mike Garrison, a director of 
the Westminster Firefighters Assn. Local 2425. "The council has stooped to an 
all-time low." 
</P>
<P>
 But council members insist the investigation is justified, and that it might 
lead to criminal charges being filed against some firefighters and their 
superiors, based on a financial audit that found massive overtime that could be 
attributed to fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 10-week period, from July 1 to Sept. 15 last year, for instance, the 
audit discovered that the Fire Department incurred $283,000 in overtime 
expenses, four times more than the department's fiscal 1993-94 overtime budget 
of $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Charles V. Smith said the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick in Costa 
Mesa is looking closer into the records for that period to determine "why so 
much money has been spent in so short a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary results of the audit, including the department's daily logs of 
firefighters coming to work, have been turned over to investigators, according 
to City Atty. Richard Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said that although the district attorney's probe started two months ago, 
there have been no requests for additional information or interviews with 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Guy N. Ormes, who heads the district attorney's unit that 
investigates corruption by public officials, has declined to disclose the scope 
of the investigation, but sources say it may include a look into the 
possibility of a broad conspiracy to defraud the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the firefighters' lawyer, Alan C. Davis, said Thursdaythat he will 
ask the district attorney to investigate what he described as "criminal 
slander" and "invasion of privacy" committed by members of the council against 
his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said council members have embarrassed the firefighters and tarnished 
their reputation through "outrageously false and malicious" public statements 
that implied criminal conduct on the part of the firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who represented the firefighters in a lawsuit against the city over 
layoffs last year, said he expects the district attorney to dismiss the 
allegations against his clients, and "then begin the serious business of 
investigating our charges of criminal slander." 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange of charges is the latest in the escalating dispute between the 
council and the firefighters union, which also fought in court last year and 
are now at opposite ends of a recall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The recall campaign, which is supported by the firefighters, targets Smith and 
council members Craig Schweisinger, Charmayne S. Bohman and Tony Lam. Recall 
proponents have until Feb. 19 to gather 6,937 signatures to put the petition on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The citizens will eventually know the truth," said Garrison, who said that by 
asking for the investigation, the council wants to divert the people's 
attention from the recall effort. "The council members will be in deeper 
trouble than they've ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that the recall and the investigation are separate issues, but both 
indicate that the firefighters are after "money and power."  
</P>
<P>
 "They have fought us every step of the way," Smith said. He added that the 
reorganization of the Fire Department, which the firefighters tried to block in 
court last year, has succeeded in cutting overtime expenses in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Since October, when "floaters" were assigned to work in place of department 
employees who were sick or on vacation, overtime expenses have been steadily 
decreasing, city financial records showed. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, overtime expenses were $14,700 lower than for the same month in 
1992. Expenses for November and December also decreased. From July to December, 
1993, the overtime expenses were $64,000 less than the same period the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 That, Smith said, was in spite of the "overtime binge" from July 1 to Sept. 
15, 1993, in which the Fire Department incurred nearly $300,000 in overtime 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a management issue," Smith said, adding that by assigning floaters, 
which was the key to the reorganization, the city has eliminated the need for 
overtime, except in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that council members were surprised by the extent of "overtime 
abuse" uncovered through the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we dug deeper, we uncovered more worm," he said.

STANTON MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS SEEK RENT CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 angry residents of the city's mobile home parks attended the 
City Council meeting this week to demand rent control. Many said they are on 
fixed incomes and are in danger of losing their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 1,200 mobile homes in the city at 10 mobile home parks, 
planning manager Mark D. Lloyd said. Voters narrowly rejected a ballot attempt 
in 1984 to establish rent control at city mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Katella Mobile Home Park, the city's largest, led the protest 
at the council meeting. They said their rents were improperly raised. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Thomas W. Allen told the council the rent issue was a 
private-property matter over which the city has no jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Sal Sapien said he is concerned about the dispute and asked both 
parties to work together to resolve it. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the council, Katella park resident Ginger Jordan said she knew 
of a family whose rent was raised without the required 60 days' notice. She 
also said another family moved in and then found the monthly rent was $50 
higher than what they had been told. 
</P>
<P>
 After presenting her charges to the council, Jordan received loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Park manager Marsha Carter, who attended the meeting, said afterward that new 
residents are not required to be given 60 days' notice. She also said she 
wished that Jordan and other park residents had contacted her before bringing 
their complaints to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have met with them anyway," Carter said. "They never asked me." 
</P>
<P>
 She said rent increases were 4% in 1993 and 3% in 1992 and have typically been 
kept close to cost-of-living increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter pledged to meet with Jordan and other residents. Jordan, at Sapien's 
request, stood up at the meeting and agreed to talk with Carter about the 
problems.

RIGHTS PANEL TO MONITOR DEPUTY SHOOTING INVESTIGATION; INQUIRY: THE HUMAN 
RELATIONS COMMISSION WILL ACT AS 'A LISTENING AGENT' FOR THOSE IN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROBE. 
</P>

<P>
 The Orange County Human Relations Commission agreed Thursday night to monitor 
the investigation into the Christmas Day shooting death of Sheriff's Deputy 
Darryn Leroy Robins by another deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 While commission members took no formal action, they said they will remain in 
close contact with law enforcement officials and black community leaders who 
have concerns about the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This commission can act as a listening agent," said Chairwoman Fran Williams, 
a Rancho Santiago College professor. "We're not here to fan the fire or point a 
finger. The investigation is underway, and a lot of questions remain." 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, 30, who was black, was killed when fellow Deputy Brian Scanlan, 32, 
who is white, shot him in the face during what authorities describe as an 
impromptu field training exercise in Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan was using a loaded gun during the drill in what Sheriff Brad Gates has 
said was a violation of department policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have called the shooting an accident but have released few details 
about what happened, citing the ongoing investigation by the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The dearth of information released since the shooting has prompted some black 
community leaders to call for a federal investigation into possible 
civil-rights violations in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those leaders, Lake Forest health administrator Eugene Wheeler, spoke 
before the commission Thursday night, encouraging the panel to take a stand in 
support of the independent investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something going on here," Wheeler said of the shooting. "We're 
confused why other intelligent people can't see what we see." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission decided to discuss the Robins shooting during its monthly 
meeting to reassure members of the black community who may be concerned about 
the integrity of the probe, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the case has been "handled well," and that the commission may be able 
to defuse tensions among community members who are suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to see this escalate into something that it is not," she said 
before Thursday night's meeting.

LAGUNA HILLS ALLOWS FORTUNE-TELLING FOR PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fortune-telling businesses will be allowed in the city, following the adoption 
of an ordinance by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 Tuesday for the new ordinance, with Councilman Randal 
J. Bressette dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the city prohibited fortune-telling for pay under a county zoning 
code the city adopted when it incorporated in 1991. Such a ban was ruled 
unconstitutional by the California Supreme Court in 1985 but had not been 
changed on the county's books. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance, which will allow fortune-telling businesses to operate in 
three specific commercially zoned areas, is based on similar regulations of 
cities in Los Angeles and Orange counties, including Tustin and Irvine. Those 
zones are called "commercial regional," "commercial community" and "commercial 
highway." 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance also requires commercial fortune-tellers to acquire permits 
each year by submitting applications with their personal, criminal and 
fortune-telling histories. 
</P>
<P>
 The applications would be subject to the review and approval of the police 
chief, who would also conduct an independent investigation of the applicant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bressette objected to the ordinance because it did not adequately protect the 
public from the businesses, which he said have acquired unseemly reputations. 
His attempts to require applicants to post a bond and provide more information 
on previous fortune-telling violations failed to gain support from other 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very troubled by this but . . . every concern I have seems to reach a 
dead end," Bressette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Responded City Atty. Lois E. Jeffrey: "We feel that this particular ordinance, 
as it is worded, gives adequate protection to the public" without infringing on 
a commercial fortune-teller's constitutional rights.

TRAILER PARK RESIDENTS' FUTURE IS TOPIC OF 5-HOUR DISCUSSION; PLANNING: LAGUNA 
BEACH COUNCIL DELAYS DECISION ON AID TO TREASURE ISLAND RESIDENTS IN WAY OF 
DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Addressing one of the city's most agonizing problems, the City Council heard 
five hours of testimony on how much -- or little -- it should do to help 
Treasure Island Mobilehome Park residents as the landowners prepare to close 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 While some speakers urged the council to support relocation benefits for 
tenants, including having the landowner pay full market value for the coaches 
based on their worth at the oceanfront location, others said the city should 
not impose restrictions that would lead to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we're not the sentimental favorite in this dispute, and that may be an 
understatement, but we're right on the law," Charles Black, an attorney for the 
property owners, said during the Tuesday night meeting. "Treasure Island is 
going to close. Its useful life as a mobile home park is about over." 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-acre park, located at the city's south end, was purchased for $43 
million in 1989 by an investment group formed by Merrill Lynch Hubbard and 
headed by Costa Mesa businessman Richard Hall. The owners want to develop the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Grieving at the prospect of losing their tightknit, 57-year-old community, 
where neighbors share potluck dinners and pancake breakfasts, residents and 
their supporters pleaded for the council's support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before this place is destroyed, you have to realize it's an irreplaceable 
piece of Laguna Beach's ambience and history," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weary as the emotional debate continued, the council postponed its final 
decisions while guiding the city staff in crafting a resolution on what park 
owners must pay to relocate tenants, some of whom have lived there for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 A final vote on that resolution and on a conditional use permit needed to 
close the park is expected on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In 3-2 votes, the council made tentative decisions to allow the landowner to 
choose from the following options when closing the park: 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid paying relocation benefits by allowing the coaches to stay on the 
property for 10 years, with a proviso that would provide "stability" of rents. 
In the past, the council sought to impose rent control at the city's three 
mobile home parks, but voters rejected that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pay to relocate the coaches to another mobile home park deemed suitable by 
the city and the tenants, or buy tenants comparable replacement coaches at a 
similarly suitable park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pay 60% of the coaches' fair market value, as determined at the present 
location, to owners who relocate their homes within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Ann Christoph, Robert F. Gentry and Lida Lenney favored the 
motions; members Wayne L. Peterson and Kathleen Blackburn voted against all of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very unrealistic proposal that could lead to litigation and false 
expectations by the tenants," Blackburn said.

HIT-RUN DRIVER SOUGHT BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were searching Thursday for the driver in a hit-and-run accident that 
left a 38-year-old transient with a broken jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers called to the accident at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday found victim Lester 
James Minor lying face down in front of the Big 5 Sporting Goods store at 2320 
S. Harbor Blvd., said Investigator Robert DePaola. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange for treatment of the broken 
jaw and abrasions on his head, chest, right arm and abdomen. The patient was in 
stable condition Thursday, DePaola said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police the driver of a black 1989 Nissan Sentra was northbound 
on Harbor Boulevard when Minor stepped off the sidewalk onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor told officers he did not see the car coming, DePaola said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentra then sped off but was later found abandoned behind a building 
nearby, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators think the owner of the car, a Huntington Beach man, was the 
driver in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 However, DePaola declined to identify him because "we don't want him to run 
away if he knew we were looking for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information should contact DePaola or Investigator Chuck O'Connor 
at (714) 254-1532, or Sgt. Richard Buchholz at (714) 254-1861.

COVER STORY; TWELVE MORE, ELEVEN MORE (C' MON, YOU CAN DO IT!); MORE WAYS TO A 
BETTER BOD!! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE SCHLOSBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Suzanne Schlosberg writes 
frequently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a January tradition: You realize that your exercise program of late has 
consisted of laps around the holiday buffet table. You know you're in shape -- 
the shape of an eggplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again you vow to start exercising, but before long, boredom sets in. The 
Stairmaster becomes the stairmonster, and your New Year's resolution becomes a 
thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 According to fitness experts, however, this year could be different. The 
fitness industry has developed new forms of exercise and updated a number of 
old ones. Instructors say that even the most reluctant exerciser can find a way 
to stay motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in our industry are becoming a lot more innovative," says Vince 
Weigel, program director for the Aerobics and Fitness Assn. of America, a 
Sherman Oaks organization that certifies aerobics instructors and personal 
trainers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, building muscle strength doesn't necessarily involve heavy machinery. You 
can pull a giant rubber band in your living room or press a foam dumbbell under 
water. To get a cardiovascular workout, you can slide across a plastic board or 
jump with a heavy rubber rope. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many methods of exercise that you can't possibly get bored," 
says Tim Belknap, fitness director at Mid-Valley Athletic Club in Reseda, which 
now offers country line-dancing classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today more people understand that lifting weights isn't just about looking 
good. It can help ward off osteoporosis by making bones more dense. And it can 
help accelerate weight loss. Responding to public interest in strength 
training, the fitness industry has devised more convenient and less 
intimidating methods than the traditional one: lifting barbells. At the same 
time, instructors and equipment manufacturers have created more methods of 
cardiovascular exercise, which has been shown to significantly decrease the 
risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. After all, how many 
aerobics classes can a person take? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a closer look at 10 innovative ways to exercise: 1. Yoga 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Accomazzo says people have the wrong idea about yoga. "They think you 
have to stand on your head and sit in a pretzel position," says Accomazzo, who 
teaches yoga in her Northridge studio, Prema Vikara. "Or they think you're 
tripping out or meditating on your navel." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, yoga is a series of postures -- some of them quite difficult -- that 
increases flexibility, muscle tone and strength, particularly in the abdominal 
and lower back muscles. Yoga can even provide a cardiovascular workout if the 
moves are performed without rest in between. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Accomazzo says, yoga helps reduce stress because the moves 
require you to concentrate on breathing. "Breathing is the link between the 
mind and body," she says. "It's mindful, purposeful breathing. You're too 
occupied to think about the stresses in your life . . . about how you've got to 
get to the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Many health clubs and studios offer yoga. To find an experienced instructor, 
call the International Assn. of Yoga Therapists, (310) 306-8845. To reach 
Accomazzo, call (818) 701-5277. 2. Step 
</P>
<P>
 Step Aerobics has taken, well, a giant step forward since it was introduced in 
health clubs five years ago. Instead of just stepping up and down on the 
adjustable platform, instructors are adding fancier choreography and using the 
steps for strength training as well. The Sports Club L.A. in West Los Angeles 
even has step classes in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Step aerobics has vastly expanded," says Vince Weigel, program director for 
the Aerobics and Fitness Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 a Mid-Valley Athletic Club in Reseda, for instance, has introduced an 
"aerostep" class. Members fasten on their "aero belt" -- a wide belt with 
elastic tubing that extends from the belt to cuffs wound around their wrists. 
As they step up, down, and diagonally on the step, they press their arms 
forward and upward, pulling the tubing from their wrist cuffs. The idea is to 
build upper-body strength while stepping. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more intense than regular step -- and that's saying a lot," said Julie 
Moffett, 36, of Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Some class members, however, have found that the arm movements require so much 
concentration that they take the fun out of stepping. "It's an innovative way 
to work out," says instructor Deby Spellman, "but it's not for everyone." 3. 
Slide Boarding 
</P>
<P>
 On a stair climber, you move up and down. On a treadmill, you move forward. 
What's missing from most workouts is side-to-side -- lateral -- motion. 
</P>
<P>
 The slide board has filled this gap. It's a plastic board with padded bumpers 
on both ends. You slip nylon booties over your athletic shoes, push off from 
one end of the board, then glide from side to side, mimicking the motion of a 
speed skater. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not nearly as easy as it looks. "People are really shocked at how fast 
your heart rate gets up," says Lea Barrett, who teaches slide board classes at 
the Westlake Sporthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is slide boarding a good cardiovascular workout, but it also can 
enhance agility and coordination as well as develop strength in the quadriceps, 
inner and outer thigh muscles, rear end and calves. Lateral training, Barrett 
says, is particularly helpful for tennis, skiing and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Slide boards are available at sporting goods stores for about $100. 4. Pilates 
</P>
<P>
 One strength-training method that has become popular in the '90s was, in fact, 
invented in the '20s. The Pilates (pronounced Pi-LAH-tees) method revolves 
around the "reformer," a horizontal device that resembles a small bed frame. 
You lie, kneel or sit on the device and push or pull against tension provided 
by the springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's designed to give equal emphasis on strength, flexibility and endurance," 
says Pilates instructor Michael Levy, owner of Private Moves studio in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Most strength-training methods simply are designed to increase muscle size and 
strength. And whereas many machines target a single muscle group -- say, the 
quadriceps, biceps or hamstrings -- every Pilates exercise requires control of 
the entire body, particularly the abdominal muscles. Also, Pilates movements 
require a lot more concentration than weight-machine exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 Invented by Joseph Pilates, a German-born gymnast who died in 1967, Pilates 
has long been popular with dancers because the moves tend to produce long, lean 
muscles rather than big, bulky ones. "It's not just about pumping up your 
thighs," Levy says. "There's a sense of lengthening the whole body." 
</P>
<P>
 Pilates workouts require an instructor, and individual sessions cost between 
$20 and $50. A decade ago there were a half-dozen Pilates studios in the United 
States; today there are more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call Levy, (818) 783-0097. 5. Rubber Tubing 
</P>
<P>
 There's more you can do with a rubber band than hold together a stack of 
envelopes. In fact, you can strengthen your thigh muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant bands -- about a foot long and up to an inch thick -- can be used along 
with rubber tubes to strengthen virtually every muscle in the body. Experts say 
they're an effective alternative to lifting dumbbells or using weight machines. 
</P>
<P>
 To train your biceps, for instance, you can step on a tube, grasp the handles 
by your thighs, then slowly lift your hands toward your shoulders and lower 
them back down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Using rubber bands tends to help you as far as the proper technique," says 
Kenny Ball, director of fitness programs at the Powerhouse Aerobic Fitness 
Center in Chatsworth. "They require much more control than a Nautilus machine. 
You have to release the band slowly or it's going to snatch your arms back 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Tubes and bands also are popular among home exercisers because they're 
inexpensive -- under $10 in stores or mail-order catalogues -- and they take up 
a lot less space than a weight machine. Most bands come with instructional 
booklets. Some can be attached to a plastic bar, which will increase the number 
of exercises you can perform. 6. Jumping Rope  
</P>
<P>
 Jump ropes have changed a lot since you used them during recess at elementary 
school. They're now made of durable materials that don't fray, such as nylon 
encased in polyvinyl, and some have spongy, easy-to-grip handles. 
</P>
<P>
 The ropes also turn more smoothly because they're connected to the handles 
with a ball-and-socket design. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ropes, such as the Spalding SportRope, come in different weights -- from 
half a pound to three pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have those memories of jumping for hours on end, but when you get 
started with (a weighted) rope, you'll be wiped out after a minute," says David 
Paul, who includes jump ropes in the boxing classes he teaches at Brignole 
Fitness Center in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts recommend doing "intervals" -- alternating 10 to 60 seconds of jumping 
with 10 to 60 seconds of rest. As you become better conditioned, increase the 
amount of time you jump and decrease the amount of rest you take. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure to keep your knees and elbows slightly bent, Paul says, and let your 
wrists do the work. "You don't want to make big circles with your arms," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jumping ropes is an excellent way to increase cardiovascular fitness as well 
as coordination. Done properly, physiologists say, it places less stress on 
your knees and ankles than jogging, because you land on both feet at once and 
don't lift as high off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 For information on the Spalding SportRope, call (800) 222-JUMP. 7. Water 
Workouts 
</P>
<P>
 Exercising in the water isn't just for runners who are injured or older people 
who have arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you're young (and healthy), it's a good place to start," says Kendy 
Preis, manager of the Total Woman health club in Tarzana. "You can go at your 
own pace. In most exercise classes, you're always trying to keep up with the 
person next to you. But in the pool, people can't see everything you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Water aerobics has been around for years, but today's water classes include 
strength-training equipment as well, such as foam dumbbells and webbed gloves 
to create more resistance. Preis includes squats and abdominal exercises in her 
classes. "There's a whole bunch of sit-ups you can do in the pool that a lot of 
people don't have the strength to do outside of the water," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many water classes mix strength training with water running, jumping and 
cross-country ski motions. "People think, 'What do you guys do, float in the 
pool?' It's not that at all," Preis says. "My sister, who's a soccer player for 
Fresno State, was laughing at me, but she took my class and came out with a red 
face." 8. Recumbent Cycling 
</P>
<P>
 Cycling -- stationary and otherwise -- has always meant one thing: pedaling in 
an upright position. For people prone to lower back pain, however, this 
position can be uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter "recumbent" cycling. On a recumbent bike, you're sitting much lower to 
the ground and reclining against a seat back. Whereas a traditional bike 
primarily targets your quadriceps muscles (front thighs), a recumbent gives 
your gluteal (buttocks) muscles a good workout as well. The recumbent may also 
be more comfortable for some people because of the back support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recumbent bike was designed primarily to reduce stress on the lower 
back," says Vince Weigel, program director for the Aerobics and Fitness Assn. 
of America. Experts recommend it especially for pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
 Recumbent cycles can be found in most health clubs. And, despite a price tag 
of $1,200 to $1,600, they're a hot item among home exercisers as well, says 
Stan Brainin, a salesman at the Walking Store in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Recumbent cycles for the road are another choice. They can be more difficult 
to steer uphill than traditional bikes, but they're faster downhill. 9. Boxing 
</P>
<P>
 No athlete is better conditioned than a finely tuned boxer -- he's got 
strength, stamina, agility and speed. 
</P>
<P>
 And no health club workout is tougher than a boxing class. It's got 
shadowboxing, bag punching, rope jumping, medicine ball drills, sit-ups, 
pushups and much, much more. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm after is stimulating the mind and the body," says David Paul, who 
teaches boxing at Brignole Fitness Center in Pasadena. "You never really get 
bored. You're so distracted that you don't realize how much exercise you've 
done until you're walking off the mat and you're totally exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing is popular among cyclists looking to develop upper-body strength, 
weightlifters who need to improve their cardiovascular conditioning and women 
who want to develop strength and assertiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 For just about everyone, Paul says, the class reduces stress. "How many times 
do people look at their co-worker and want to punch 'em? I have a lot of 
divorced clients who love the class." 
</P>
<P>
 Health clubs that offer boxing include the Agoura Hills Spectrum Club, the 
Warner Center Club in Woodland Hills and Total Woman in Tarzana. 10. Customized 
Video 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Crawford, Jane Fonda, Marilu Henner, Cher. If it seems like you're the 
only one on Earth without your own exercise video, don't worry: Rudy Hayek can 
add you to the list. 
</P>
<P>
 For $250, Hayek, owner of Paragon Fitness in Tarzana, will design a 
strength-training program tailored to your individual needs, then take you 
through the entire routine while it is professionally videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of good elements to videos out there, but you'd need four or 
five different videos" to suit your personal needs, says Hayek, a personal 
trainer certified by the American College of Sports Medicine. Hayek does not 
practice the routine with clients before taping the sessions. He wants them to 
see their mistakes and watch Hayek correct their form. "It's almost like a 
perpetual private training session," Hayek says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayek, whose studio is filled with dozens of dumbbells, poles, balls and other 
exercise gadgets, designs routines that clients can perform at home with the 
equipment they already have. In some cases, the workouts involve no equipment 
other than a chair or other pieces of furniture.

KIDS' BIKE HELMETS; HEAD DRESS; IT'S NOT JUST THE LAW FOR MINORS; IT'S A 
FASHION STATEMENT FOR WHEELERS AND DEALERS OF ALL AGES. THE LOOK OF THESE 
SHELLS ON WHEELS HAS BEEN CHANGING GEARS AS SAFETY AWARENESS HAS RISEN.

 Bicycle riders are breaking away from boring white helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a helmet while riding a bike became state law for the under-18 set 
Jan. 1. Yet while parents and legislators fret about safety, riders have an 
additional concern: fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Children -- and adults -- no longer pedal around in clunky helmets that make 
them look like lunar astronauts. Thanks to innovative designs by helmet 
manufacturers, bicyclists can sport sleeker, colorful helmets that fit a wide 
range of tastes, not to mention heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as Giro and Bell have pulled ahead of the pack with adult- and 
child-size helmets that come in trendy colors such as purple and teal. Some 
helmets come in "fader" tones that go from light to dark or fancy metallic hues 
that match the bikes. A few helmets have fun graphics such as paint splotches, 
stripes and even dog paw prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmet styles began changing gears several years ago, when wearing a bike 
helmet became more common. 
</P>
<P>
 "People became more aware of how important it is to wear a helmet," says Sue 
Grisson, co-owner of Rainbow Bicycle Co. in Laguna Beach. "And they were more 
likely to wear them if they looked cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Riders now have their pick of helmet styles at Rainbow Bicycle Co. For kids, 
there's a white helmet by Bell festooned with a colorful alphabet soup ($42), a 
"Rover" style by Troxel covered with black paw prints ($35) and Troxel's 
teal-colored helmet adorned with barking dogs and abstract swirls and zig-zags 
($35). 
</P>
<P>
 For adults, there's the sleek "Diva" from Troxel with a pearly finish that 
fades from deep purple to white or red to yellow ($50) and the "Black Light" 
from Giro with purple streaks that glow on the helmet's black surface ($84), as 
well as assorted solid-colored and metallic helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies have souped up their helmets to look like something out of the 
Indianapolis 500. The "Streetrider" style from Bell comes with racing stripes 
down the sides, available at Performance Bicycle Shop in Brea, Fountain Valley 
and Irvine. The shop also carries "Air Blast" helmets by Giro that look like 
they've been worn while riding through a rain of blue paint. Helmets range from 
$30 to $140. 
</P>
<P>
 "Giro's known for wild colors. And they change colors every year, just like 
fashion designers," says Greyson Tipping, manager of Performance Bicycle Shop 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Giro's '94 helmets come in deep jewel tones, including a few "faders" in 
graduating shades of purple, red or yellow. One of Giro's newest helmets has 
webbing that drops down onto the neck -- it helps stabilize the helmet, Tipping 
says, and riders think it makes them look cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year's styles promise to be even wilder. 
</P>
<P>
 At bike shows, Specialized has been showing off its "Piranha" prototype, a 
blue helmet with a small fin on top and a mouth full of sharp teeth in front, 
Tipping says. While some helmets have only four vents, the "Piranha" will have 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're designing helmets so that it's just as cool to wear one as not to, 
due to wind tunneling and the placement of the vents," Tipping says. 
</P>
<P>
 Extra vents help keep the head cool while riding, and it helps that most 
helmets no longer cover the ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older helmets were cumbersome. They were almost painful because they were so 
heavy," Tipping says. "Now they weigh only seven to nine ounces." 
</P>
<P>
 Helmets have become more bearable thanks to a thin plastic shell and insides 
made from lightweight Polystyrene foam. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like high-tech ice chest material," says Kenny Woods, manager of 
Bicycles Etc. in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 "Years ago helmets were heavy and hard. Now they're lightweight with lots of 
ventilation holes," Woods says. They also have a sleeker, more aerodynamic 
shape instead of the bowling ball looks of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 When choosing a helmet, experts recommend first finding one that fits well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should fit snugly but not too tight," Woods says. "Everybody's head size 
is a different shape and size." 
</P>
<P>
 Some manufacturers make their helmets more oval, while others make them 
rounder. The helmets come with foam pads that adjust to fit the head. One 
top-of-the-line helmet by Bell comes with a Reebok pump system that inflates to 
the exact proportions of the rider's head. It sells for about $140 at 
Performance Bicycle Shops and Bicycles Etc. in San Clemente, Mission Viejo and 
Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put it on and pump the little bladder inside up for a perfect fit," Woods 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Riders should choose a helmet that meets the safety standards of the American 
National Standard Institute or the Snell Foundation, which has even stricter 
safety guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing the right helmet can save a rider's life, and no one knows that better 
than Tipping. He credits a bike helmet with saving him from a serious head 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was during a race. I got cut off and hit a cone and went head first over 
my bike. When I crashed, I hit the front side of the helmet going 30 m.p.h.," 
he says. "Other than a road rash and a little headache, I was fine. But the 
helmet was destroyed."

HE SAID, SHE SAID / PATRICK MOTT AND ANN CONWAY: OUT WITH THE OLD, THE AWFUL,

 I t was another year of fashion crimes and misdemeanors, as well as a success 
or two here and there, and -- before anyone can stop us -- we're going to 
rehash a handful of them. And hazard a look at the newest stuff for 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 Hanging in the balance of this debate is no less a question than whether 
civilization is going straight down the pipes or whether it's on the way to new 
highs of greatness and glory. At least that's what we decided after a few 
post-New Year's glasses of cordon rouge.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyhow, over the edge we go . . .  
</P>
<P>
 HE: Please, God, let 1994 be the year that Dr. Martens took the first of 
several fatal body shots. Without doubt the most grotesque footwear ever 
conceived, the boots make decade-old rental bowling shoes look chic, nevermind 
that they've become inextricably associated with such cuddly social groups as 
skinheads and neo-Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's assume, just for a moment, that most modern humans attempt to dress in 
order to appear attractive. Let's also assume that a statistically significant 
number of them own Dr. Martens and think they look very smart and sexy in them. 
These people are lobotomized. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I'm happy to say bye-bye to the beret. I've seen it at veggie counters, 
in movie houses, at the office, on the freeway and at the beach. Enough 
already. Cute as it is, few people know how to wear it, what to wear it with or 
where to wear it. (Answers: at an angle; anything long and skinny; out to 
lunch). A suggestion for misguided fad lovers: Clip a picture of a magazine 
model wearing a faddie item you like. Copy the look. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Also on the headwear front, I'm having more and more trouble lately 
resisting the urge to smack any kid wearing a baseball cap backward. An entire 
generation has grown up thinking that the bill goes in the back. So, children, 
let's get it straight: The bill is there to shield your eyes, not to send a 
message to your parents that you're a sloppy, shuffling, truculent, whiny, 
rebellious, mean-spirited, hypersensitive little goofball. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse: The cap manufacturers, knuckling to corporate bottom-line pressure, are 
stitching the logos on the back of the caps so they can be seen from the front 
when the cap is worn backward. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I love the way women with long hair used the baseball cap as a hair 
accessory. They pulled their locks through the hole in the back and made them 
tornado-proof. 
</P>
<P>
 In my book, the best thing about 1993 was the fashion freedom. If you dressed 
to the hilt, it was OK (providing you left your mega-diamonds and furs at 
home), and if you dressed down -- so much the better. Bill and Hillary set the 
tone: Have style, but don't become its victim. Wear your clothes; don't let 
them wear you. Bottom line: It's what's in your head that counts -- not what's 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: The First Family, I think, is going to set a certain tone in fashion this 
year. Mrs. Clinton, particularly, seems to be doing it right. She occasionally 
agrees to do fashion shoots with outfits like Vogue but wipes away the curse by 
laughing it off and declaring that she's no authority on what to wear. She's 
said that the speculation about her clothes amuses her and that it's sometimes 
actually fun. And that's the way she treats it, with not a bit more weight than 
that. We should all be so well-adjusted about our appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I took a swing through a couple of department stores last week and 
noticed that most of the women shoppers were in the sportswear department, 
combing through the sweats. The designer departments were deader than last 
year's hemline. In 1993, sweats were stronger than ever. In 1994, I hope 
designers elevate them a bit -- endow them with upbeat colors and more style. 
Are you listening, Calvin and Donna? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I've been seeing that happen in what has traditionally been a stronghold 
of gonzo fashion: golf duds. In talking to a couple of friends who are teaching 
pros, I've heard that the golf clothing lines are not only on a far more 
understated and stylish course, they figure to stay that way through the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that many manufacturers have disabused themselves of bizarre plaids and 
the Pants From Hell, now they can concentrate on subtly bringing back bolder 
color -- brighter greens, for instance, instead of, say, heather. In 1993, a 
lot of the stuff in the pro shops was muted and fairly conservative. This year, 
using that palette as a kind of jumping-off place, the designers can start 
getting a bit more daring. But stylishly so, without the shocking pink 
Sansabelts. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: One trend I hope continues: people reaching deep into their closets and 
giving away the clothing they no longer wear. Fashion gurus say if you haven't 
worn an item for a year, chances are you'll never wear it again. So why not 
give it to someone in need? 
</P>
<P>
 I know a woman who has three closets full of clothes -- each one for a 
different size. Truth is, she's never going to wear those 8s and 10s again and 
she knows it. So, this year, she plans to give them away. "I've been kidding 
myself about some of those clothes," she said recently. "Guess I've been 
holding onto a dream." 
</P>
<P>
 I can say the same thing about some of the oldies-but-goodies in my closet. In 
1994, they're going out the door.

LOST IN THE HOOPLA; TRIAL: THE RIBALD T-SHIRTS AND INTERNATIONAL MEDIA 
SURROUNDING THE CASE OF LORENA AND JOHN WAYNE BOBBITT HAS OBSCURED THE GENUINE 
EMOTIONAL PAIN AND SUFFERING. 
</P>

<P>
 It is already being called the Mother of All Marital Disputes, a battle royal 
of the sexes that has captivated and -- let's admit it -- titillated the 
attention not only of the nation but of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorena Bobbitt's lawyer, James Lowe, refers to it in his courtroom questioning 
simply as "the Cutting," a decorous if somewhat awkward description that makes 
it sound as if he is talking about a major made-for-TV movie -- which doubtless 
it will soon be. 
</P>
<P>
 Could Andrew Lloyd Webber make a musical of this? 
</P>
<P>
 What Lowe is referring to, of course, is the fact that Lorena Bobbitt cut off 
her husband's penis on the night of June 23 in retaliation for what she says 
were years of marital abuse that included beatings, forced anal sex and torture 
with "Marine-style" martial arts techniques that John Wayne Bobbitt picked up 
during a hitch in the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she is on trial in a courthouse 30 miles west of Washington, facing a 
future that could include 20 years behind bars. And while the verdict is still 
in doubt, one thing has become abundantly clear: This small Southern town, 
renown for its Civil War history, has not seen an invasion from the North of 
this magnitude since the Battle of Bull Run. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of reporters, reinforced by caravans of satellite trucks, have 
converged on Manassas, whose entrepreneurs have wasted no time in figuring out 
a way to commemorate their newest if somewhat dubious claim to national fame 
with T-shirts that depict a Civil War canon, its barrel quite obviously cleaved 
in two, under the inscription: "Remembered Again! Manassas, Va." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, of course, only one of a number of T-shirts and other souvenirs -- most 
of them unmentionable in a family newspaper -- that profiteers and partisans on 
both sides of the Bobbitt battle line are hawking outside the Prince Williams 
County courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the "Official John Wayne Bobbitt T-Shirt," autographed by the victim 
himself, with proceeds going to the John Wayne Bobbitt Legal Support Fund. The 
front of the shirt depicts a maniacal-looking woman wielding a carving knife; 
the back says, "Love Hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 A few yards away, on the other side of the grassy hillock, a local rock band 
is entertaining reporters with "50 Ways to Cleave Your Lover." Meanwhile, 
Lorena's supporters are busy hawking their wares, which include "Lorena Bobbitt 
for Surgeon General" lapel pins and other things that are more clever but less 
mentionable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in the middle of this circus of microphones and TV cameras, of 
X-rated souvenirs and shameless publicity stunts, of slick media advisers 
negotiating the price tags for their clients' interviews and journalists from 
foreign lands so desperate for color that they are interviewing other 
journalists from foreign lands about all the media hype, somewhere in all of 
this a serious trial is supposed to be taking place.  
</P>
<P>
 A trial laced with genuine emotional pain and suffering; a drama -- dare one 
use a pun -- about the dismembered dreams of a young and strikingly handsome 
couple who fell in love at a Marine ball four years ago but somehow stumbled 
over the edge of a dark psychological precipice soon after they were married. 
</P>
<P>
 If only it didn't involve a penis, if only Lorena Bobbitt had plunged the 
knife into her sleeping husband's heart instead of that other part of his 
anatomy, this would be a trial about murder and spousal abuse without the 
T-shirts or the stand-up comedians or the chocolate bars shaped in the image of 
a you-know-what and sold in wrappers bearing the slogan, "Melts in Your Mouth, 
Not in Your Hand." 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of who is more to blame and no matter what the verdict (now 
expected sometime next week), John Wayne and Lorena Bobbitt are destined to 
lead the rest of their lives as jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Long after the reporters have gone and the satellite dishes have been packed 
up and sent off to other stories, the Bobbitt name will live on in late-night 
TV monologues and comedy club routines. Hey, let's face it: Neither of them is 
going to have an easy time from now on getting dates, right? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under more normal circumstances, one might expect women's groups to be 
rallying around Lorena's cause, especially now that the defense has done what 
legal experts agree is a convincing job of portraying her as a classic case of 
the battered spouse. But at the Washington office of the Women's Legal Defense 
Fund, calls to Director Judith Lichtman are deflected by press aides who say: 
"Sorry, but we're not commenting on that." 
</P>
<P>
 The case in some ways represents "the flip side of violence against women" but 
the "carnival-like atmosphere and the heinous nature of the act . . . have 
completely obscured the issues," laments Judith Olton Mueller, director of the 
Vienna, Va.-based Women's Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, the Bobbitt trial is likely 
"to set back the course of gender relations because there is nothing good to 
say about it," says Mueller, adding: "We'll all breathe a huge sigh of relief 
when it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the trial is providing what appears to be a welcome change of 
pace for hordes of Washington-based reporters weary from covering budget 
battles, health care debates and complex trade issues with funny-sounding 
acronyms. Why, even the venerable Economist of London was at the trial one day 
-- although its somewhat embarrassed bureau chief quickly explained that he was 
there only because the Home Office had ordered him to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just trying to find out if this sets some sort of legal precedence," he 
sniffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh-huh.

ON SOLID FOOTING; IT ONCE WAS ONE STORE. THEN IT BECAME SIX. NOW, NA NA, THE 
MECCA FOR FANS OF THE HIPPEST SHOES AROUND, AIMS TO MAKE BIGGER STRIDES WITH 
ITS OWN LINES.

<P>
 As a drama major at the University of Missouri, Nancy Kaufman was, well, 
dramatic . She was the campus weirdo who wore flamboyant clothing and called 
herself Na Na, after Emile Zola's heroine. 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades later, the weirdness and the drama continue -- in the form of 
merchandise. Along with husband Paul and former college chum Lynn Tyler, Nancy 
owns the Na Na Trading Company, an "alternative fashion" source headquartered 
in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The multimillion-dollar company -- spawned in a tiny store without plumbing 
that Nancy and Tyler opened in 1976 -- encompasses six retail stores, a 
mail-order business and an international wholesale operation. Na Na advertises, 
but it hardly needs to. Sassy, Harper's Bazaar, Rolling Stone, Esquire and 
other publications frequently splash its big, clunky boots and shoes across 
their pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Hipper-than-thou customers shop Na Na for everything from work shirts and 
overalls to flared cords, crooner-style cardigans, cropped "baby" Ts, plaid 
pantyhose and trucker-inspired wallets on long zoot suit chains. But the 
retailer's main attraction has always been outrageous footwear, including 
English-made, industrial-strength Dr. Marten shoes and boots. Na Na's own 
concoctions are even more outlandish: boots with wide, upturned toes; shoes and 
boots atop mile-high striped platforms; thick-soled, no-shine Mary Janes for 
adults, and work-weight boots with lug soles so thick and grooved they could 
move a tractor. 
</P>
<P>
 For 11 years, Na Na and Dr. Marten were joined at the ankle. Six months ago, 
at the height of the Doc Marten-grunge frenzy, Na Na was distributing about 
25,000 pairs a month. But late last year, the companies parted over their 
distribution deal. And without the Docs to drum up business, Na Na is taking 
strides to stand on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of an expansion and reorganization plan, the company has put more 
emphasis on its own footwear designs, including the new Blue Plate Shoe line. 
The $60-to-$80 collection features knockoffs of such Na Na originals as the 
$160 pole climber boots worn by Naomi Campbell and the dancers in Madonna's 
"Girlie" show. 
</P>
<P>
 Production of the menswear collection, for which Paul won a California Mart 
Rising Star nomination last year, has been scaled back to free funds for the 
shoes. And three unisex utility-clothing lines have been consolidated into the 
strongest one, Welt Ware. 
</P>
<P>
 Na Na's newest store opened last month in the Lab, a so-called anti-mall near 
South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. Tenants include the first Tower Records 
alternative store; Urban Outfitters (a Na Na wholesale account); Collector's 
Library, specializing in comic books; and Taxi Taxi, dealing in vintage 
clothing and guitars. The setup is "so cool," Nancy says. "Even the bathrooms 
are cool. If I were really young now, I would move in next to this place." 
</P>
<P>
 Every Na Na store has its own ambience, starting with the neighborhood: SoHo 
in New York, the Castro District in San Francisco and 3rd Street in Los 
Angeles, site of an outlet store scheduled to become a regular retail operation 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, Na Na's headquarters and store fill 
a space formerly occupied by a Thrifty drugstore and a Hallmark card shop. The 
"post-mortem" interior, as Paul describes it, contains a huge plywood torso 
above the dressing rooms, a giant abstract face with one gold and three white 
teeth, two moving mirrored globes, a half-finished inverted boot and a phallic 
symbol, which, he says, "isn't as obvious as we could have made it." 
</P>
<P>
 His office near an interior staircase is decorated with a hodgepodge of shoes 
(antique inspirations and production prototypes), sequined Haitian voodoo 
flags, and childlike artworks with moving parts made by a friend in England. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy's office resembles a tastefully cluttered Victorian sitting room, down 
to the ornate bottles of potpourri and antique love seat. Above is a walkway 
and miniature office for the progeny: 10-year-old Mae Elvis Erin Kaufman, an 
actress and model whose credits include a commercial for Fuji Film and an 
appearance in Italian children's Vogue, and Bix Nathaniel King Kaufman, 6, also 
a professional model. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The foursome -- plus a menagerie including two white rats that recently 
surprised the family with a litter -- live in a small Santa Monica house 
crammed with memorabilia, much of it from the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy says neighbors and passersby call it "the Elvis house," because the 
display-case front window ("part of the reason I wanted to buy this house") is 
devoted to oddball arrangements. One featured "Elvis laid out in a coffin with 
money around him." 
</P>
<P>
 Antics like this keep Paul and Nancy, who hover near 40, in sync with their 
hard-core, youth-culture customers. "Na Na is an institution among young 
people, who are really hip and who really work at it," says Ty Moore, 30, 
co-designer of the Los Angeles-based Van Buren clothing collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore grew up in New York, with Na Na combat boots on his feet. "They captured 
the whole rebellion thing for anyone who was a teen-ager. It was like what 
Levi's did for teen-agers in the '50s. It was that basic necessity in your 
wardrobe. At first they came in black, then they went into full-blown colors. 
It was really funny. You could have lime-green hair and lime-green combat 
boots." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kaufmans try to avoid fashion labels such as punk , new wave or grunge . 
But Paul sees at least one connection: "We do have the sensibility that made 
punk such an influence -- meaning, you can do it yourself, you can think 
independently. You don't have to accept the status quo, or what I see as the 
corporate view of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Tall and prematurely gray, he typically wears multiple silver rings -- on his 
fingers and in his earlobes -- striped Na Na trousers, a plaid Na Na shirt over 
a white T-shirt and a prototype of the leather "patchwork" boots that will soon 
be in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cal Arts graduate, he designs the shoe lines, creating what he calls "our 
version of classic styles." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I can take credit for pole climbers even though they existed. It was 
an obscure style that one or two factories made for no reason. I recognized the 
value and gave them a distinctiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 He is also a founding member of the band Los Rock Angels and plays the 
washboard ("if only he would do the washing on it," Nancy remarks). Combining 
zydeco and nortena with a bit of jump blues, the group tours nationally and 
plays locally in such clubs as Santa Monica's Alligator Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy -- tall and taut with flame-red hair -- teaches aerobics six times a 
week at the Santa Monica YWCA. She is also the "PTA Mom" who takes the kids to 
acting, piano, gymnastics, hip-hop and tap-dancing lessons, as well as to their 
modeling gigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the company, the three partners have their roles. Nancy says she is the 
"public outreach." Paul is the creative arm, and publicity-shy Tyler tends to 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy learned to sew in high school and made clothing for the original store, 
where she met Paul. He was an irksome customer who commented about "overpriced" 
ceramic pins. Three years later, they were married. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in addition to bringing in unusual accessories -- such as chokers with 
miniature photographs of tombstone angels, and encouraging talented employees 
to make jewelry, hats and candles for the stores -- Nancy continues to sew. She 
whips up pillows (Elvis and Martin Luther King are favorite motifs) in the 
basement of the Santa Monica location, near the two Na Na-shod operators who 
take telephone orders on the 800 line. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Na Na's growth, Nancy says: "We are still a mom-and-pop operation." 
Their goal -- to be the first with affordable street fashion -- means Na Na is 
not cheap. Says Paul: "You can't be, if you want to be first." By his 
calculations, a man can be "pretty well outfitted" in Na Na style for $250 to 
$300, which would include two pairs of pants, two shirts, shoes, a baseball 
cap, a couple of T-shirts and a trucker wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people we create for don't have a lot of money. We didn't -- and 
we still don't," says Nancy, referring to a broad customer base, ranging in age 
from 13 to 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Elisabetta Rogiani, 37, a Los Angeles designer of her own clothing line, has 
sold to Na Na and shops there, buying what she calls "young pocket" items to 
mix with more expensive European merchandise.  
</P>
<P>
 "Through the years, it has managed to have its own look -- a filtered kind of 
English funk for America," she says. "Their approach is very young fashion; 
it's street for sure -- and strong. But anybody can shop there. You will find 
the best necklace or stockings or plaid shirt. To me, it represents an 
independent spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Berg, a video fashion stylist and hat designer, began buying Na Na boots 
10 years ago in Eugene, Ore. Now in Los Angeles, he shops the 3rd Street outlet 
and the Santa Monica location for himself and his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've always had a reputation for being on the outer limits of fashion to 
some degree," says Berg, 28. "They started out with Doc Martens. But they've 
evolved to include a lot of other fashion elements, so there's a smattering of 
everything. But they will never be like Bullock's. That's what I love about Na 
Na." 
</P>
<P>
 The music -- an eclectic mix supplied daily by employees from their personal 
collections -- is another plus for Berg. "It's really great in all the stores. 
And the salespeople are pretty wild."  
</P>
<P>
 So is the customer mix: "I'm always so surprised to see the people who shop 
there. You know, like yuppies still exist and it's fun to see them in Na Na, 
and to see them shopping side by side with people who used to be singing 
against them, people who used to listen to the Dead Kennedys." 
</P>
<P>
 How the scene will change without Dr. Marten is hard to predict. For Nancy, 
the Na Na credo remains: "To stay ahead, be ourselves and stay in business." 
</P>
<P>
 And Paul will continue "to take risks," he says. "The band was one. I'd never 
performed on a stage before. I was nervous, but if I hadn't, look what I would 
have missed. I just think, if people don't take chances, what's the point of 
being here?"

THE LAB: AN EXPERIMENT IN RETAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Picture this: stripped, wrought-iron patio furniture draped with tapestry 
fabrics and arranged over a large, worn Oriental rug, not in an enclosed space 
but al fresco . Cast-off junk, such as a yard-long ceramic fish, carefully 
exhibited as art. A few feet away, free-standing pillars support a gilded 
Madonna statuette and a vase of fresh flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 From deliberate cracks in the cement floor, stiff green reeds sprout, their 
base covered with gray pebbles. When not in use, a battered guitar leans on a 
stand, and nearby sits a pool table wrapped decoratively in yellow metals. 
</P>
<P>
 Young transient inhabitants come to this former factory and warehouse to hang 
out or peruse the alternative press publications. They listen to jazz, blues or 
alternative music ensembles that frequently perform on a stage next to a space 
known as the Gallery, where local designers show their wares on consignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon they will be able to screen premieres of music videos and watch foreign 
and art films. There are already classes in beading jewelry and events 
scheduled to meet cult artists such as pin-up illustrator Olivia. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, these visitors also come here to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Lab, a 40,000-square-foot experiment in retail, custom-tailored 
for the '90s and targeted at that most discussed, disdained and discredited 
group of the decade, lumped tidily as Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchoring the shopping center are Urban Outfitters, a chain that emphasizes 
comfort with cool; Na Na, the terminally hip retail end of a company built on 
once being the largest distributor of Dr. Marten footwear, and Tower Records 
Alternative, devoted to new music as long as it's not classical -- rock or 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lab is embraced as a one-stop source by funky Orange County youth who have 
eschewed mainstream dress, music and living and who have either had to zigzag 
the area to boutiques selling unconventional and pre-trendy fashions or travel 
north to strips such as Los Angeles' La Brea Avenue or Santa Monica's Third 
Street Promenade, which features both an Urban Outfitters and Na Na. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of its two-month-long grand opening, with a store or two set to 
open every week, the Lab is designed to be everything a traditional mall is 
not, according to founder Shaheen Sadeghi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malls are homes to corporate America; they're very much homogenized," says 
Sadeghi, who has dubbed his innovative concept, in the shadow of mecca mall 
South Coast Plaza, an "anti-mall." The term fits the anti-Establishment, 
nonconformist attitude of many teens and 20somethings who, facing uncertain 
times full of economic and environmental troubles, believe they have inherited 
a Pandora's box chock full of previous generations' waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our approach to our customer is apropos to the times. We don't try to 
dazzle," Sadeghi says. "Malls don't like people to hang out. We do. The mall 
works with national brands; we don't necessarily. I don't want to bum the malls 
out, but anybody that's young and hip doesn't want to go to a mall. Once you 
do, you lose your cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadeghi, 39, is familiar with youth culture: Before beginning the project 14 
months ago, he served a year as president of surf wear giant Quiksilver, 
preceded by five years as executive vice president at Gotcha. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is that this is not a perfect world," he continues. "People 
like (the Lab) because it's not perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Lab is imperfect, it is by general standards in appearance, especially 
so near to planned cookie-cutter communities like Irvine. The former factory 
has been gutted, carved, acid-washed and transformed into post-apocalyptic 
remains that house 15 store spaces, ranging from Urban Outfitters' 12,000 
square feet to the Collector's Library, a crammed comic book source, at 256 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Beams and pipes are exposed inside and outside stores, as are the structural 
metal tubes that once ran through a concrete wall. A few solid chunks remain as 
a reminder. Much of the wood and metal scraps that cover the walls were found 
in salvage yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of these "poor elements" within an existing structure fits the 
recycling mode so advocated by the Lab's target market, says Lab architect Ron 
Pompeii of New York-based Pompeii A.D. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than create a synthetic bubble where everyone is pulled in and 
air-conditioned and treated to Muzak, we cut into an existing structure, 
revealing what's there instead of covering it with some other kind of 
material," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Pompeii's application of this naked, utilitarian architectural 
philosophy to several of Urban Outfitters' 15 stores that prompted Sadeghi to 
hire the designer for the Lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to represent architecturally with the Lab is a state of 
mind: one of discovery, experimentation, one of looking for an identity," 
Pompeii adds. "We're not trying to build, but expose something with all its 
imperfections in a very raw, unadorned fashion. It's a lot less pretentious, 
but more direct, honest." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The surrounding landscaping doesn't grow grass or bushes that are perfectly 
manicured, but a vegetable garden. 
</P>
<P>
 A walkway features Day of the Dead-inspired ofrendas, or altars that seem to 
pay homage to the soul of Andy Warhol: flavored with current pop-art fare such 
as mutant dolls, faded letter blocks, hammered aluminum cans and the images of 
the Virgin of Guadalupe. Dried oak leaves are stapled to the wall around the 
altars. On the opposite wall, found lumber, dried flowers and clunky shoes have 
been artfully nailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the anti-mall theme, Sadeghi invited retailers that avoid malls, 
like Na Na. "This is the only one that's in any kind of 'mall,' " says Na Na 
co-owner Lynn Tyler, "and this isn't a traditional mall, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Orange County has ranked among Na Na's better markets, selling 
wholesale to boutiques like Sunline Electric Chair in Huntington Beach, Tyler 
says they never considered opening a store here until they were approached 
about the Lab. The 1,000-square-foot shop sells footwear, accessories and work 
wear under Na Na's signature labels, including Utility, Na Na Industrial 
Strength and Blue Plate.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the center itself, Tyler speculates that it will "become a real 
attraction," even for shoppers living outside the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the Lab considered a bazaar-like environ where up-and-coming local 
designers could set up shop, much like London's Hyper Hyper, which supports new 
English designers. That, however, was nixed, says Sadeghi, because "you just 
can't shove 50 new people without prior retail experience into a space." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he cites Urban Outfitters as an outlet for fledgling labels. Already, 
home-grown companies such as Split, Soul, 26 Red, Spot Girl, Fusion and Sjobeck 
hang alongside the Philadelphia-based company's own lines -- Urban Outfitters, 
Free People, Co-operative and Renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 And some local designers have settled into a home of their own at the Lab. 
Newport Beach's Modern Amusement will sell its hip, retro-style kid's clothes 
when it opens it log-cabin designed store Feb. 1. In the spirit of recycling, 
much of the store is being constructed with discarded wood; the counter is 
being made from pieces from the old Laguna Beach boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For co-owner Jeff Yokoyama, the decision to go to the Lab had to do with 
reaching "a particular clientele," he says. "We figured we would get lost in 
other centers." 
</P>
<P>
 Jewelry designer Spencer Brown sought to avoid "the general public" by opening 
his Spencer Collection/the Bead Co. at the Lab. The Belmont Shore artist sells 
some of his 600-piece line as well as thousands of beads of glass, shells, 
ceramic, semiprecious stones and other materials.  
</P>
<P>
 For Brown, the Lab store will aid in determining what designs will later be 
sold through his wholesale business. "A lot about jewelry is testing, and I 
need a group that is willing to experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyper Hyper's spirit has not been completely abandoned with the Gallery, a 
consignment showcase that will rotate local designers' wares monthly. The 
courtyard's weathered furniture is for sale by Bungalow, which has a 
conventional sister store in Laguna Beach. And, not to be left out, there is a 
Lab store that sells signature Tees, pullovers, hats and other basics dyed in 
muted colors. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's not enough for the young bohemians who will frequent the center, 
among the businesses set to open soon are Taxi Taxi, a vintage clothing store, 
a hair salon and two restaurants, in addition to a coffeehouse named the Gypsy 
Den. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to mix together all the things important to this generation," 
Sadeghi says. Like teens and twentiers who shun labels, Sadeghi emphasizes that 
the Lab should not be restricted only as a source for grunge, punk or other 
branches deemed alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is not some teen-age hangout. The stores are not about grunge. But 
this is about more than shopping. It's quite the opposite of a strip center; 
you don't pop in and leave. It is a place where culture can be nourished."

BEHIND THE SCENES; THE REAL MYTHOLOGY OF ARTIST FRANC OISE GILOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paloma Picasso bestows jewelry upon her. Pablo Picasso was inspired to paint 
her portrait, as was Henri Matisse. And her artwork has been exhibited all over 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 All are experiences to relish, but these are not the most interesting facts 
about artist Franc oise Gilot. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a woman who has two incredible jewels, "passion and wisdom," says her 
friend, author Arianna Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilot, 72, certainly has a drive of her own. She left Picasso -- the only 
woman to do so -- after living with him for 10 years. She was a longtime ally 
to poet, artist and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, and she married Dr. Jonas Salk of 
polio vaccine fame because, she said, "Lions mate with lions." 
</P>
<P>
 And she has a style of her own. At the Saturday opening of "Mythology of the 
Gods," an exhibit of her oils on canvas at the Severin Wunderman Museum 
(through April 8), Gilot wore a strikingly arabesque outfit: a black Calvin 
Klein suit with a Flamenco-style ruffled skirt, green metallic knit top from 
Yves Saint Laurent, a long floral velvet scarf and an Italian lace belt. A gold 
necklace, watch, earrings and rings were designed by her daughter Paloma. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a kind of mixture -- a kind of Russian salad, a tutti-frutti," she joked 
about her outfit before receiving the museum's Jean Cocteau International Style 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fashion for me is something I find exciting, provided you don't follow the 
dictum of fashion. I do my own thing, so to speak."

WAY OUT THERE; PUNK HAIR IS BACK ALL RIGHT, AND IT'S AS OUTRAGEOUS--AND 
COLORFUL--AS EVER. BUT THIS TIME AROUND, WEARERS SAY IT'S NOT A REBELLIOUS 
LOOK--JUST A COOL ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They look angry: The spikes dripping in red, the semi-shaven skulls tattooed 
with swirly snakes, the hatchet-job mohawks. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the adventurous young souls who dare to wear these dos insist that 
their look is not an anti-authority, rebellion thing -- not this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an art form, like anything else," says Julie Michelson, 18, of her 
partly shaved head and long, purple forelock. "Natural hair is boring. I'm not 
trying to make a statement; it's just my style." 
</P>
<P>
 Last we looked, such wild styles took their cues from the music-driven punk 
scene of the mid-to-late '70s and early '80s and were accompanied by unkind 
feelings toward the Establishment and, sometimes, violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The revival, "neo-punk" as it has been dubbed by fashion watchers, is 
practiced by a diverse crowd, many of whom have no interest in punk music, and 
carries with it a whole new attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, most of the people shaving, primary coloring and molding their hair 
into threatening shapes simply like the look. It has become "cool," even 
fashionable, showing up last fall on the runway shows of Versace, Gaultier and 
Chanel. 
</P>
<P>
 Neo-punk hair encompasses any style that is shaved and wildly colored, says 
Shala Ahmadi, owner of Royal Hair Design and Beauty Supply in West Hollywood. 
Shavers take different tacks, baring their scalps on the sides, down the middle 
or all over -- except for a little ponytail out back. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Hofmann, stylist at Carlton Hair International in the Beverly Center, 
has cut and dyed her hair into a multitude of styles and colors since she was 
13, including a series of blue, green, purple and yellow mohawks. "I did it 
partly because of the punk scene, partly because I liked it," she says. Hofmann 
now wears a simple Cleopatra cut, dyed black with purple bangs. Few clients 
request super-wild looks, she says, but she helps friends pull off punkish 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people doing it now are younger and more conservative," says Hofmann, 24. 
"Before, it was only people in their late teens, early 20s. Now, high school 
kids are doing it, and it's 'in' in the fashion circles." 
</P>
<P>
 Cory Ryan, 13, has worn a six-inch mohawk for eight months, but he says he 
likes rap music, not punk. "I wanted to show some of my friends that I can 
dress like a total punk rocker and not be one," says Cory, a Hollywood 
resident. "Everybody is so caught up in what you wear and the styles for what 
music you listen to, what nationality you are. I wanted to show that how you 
dress, or wear your hair, doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 His mohawk was purple, then blue and is now black. When he feels like spiking 
it, Cory slathers on Elmer's Glue, hair spray and mousse, lays his hair on a 
table and blow-dries it flat. 
</P>
<P>
 Older neo-punkers contending with day-job dress codes opt for funky wigs and 
hair pieces after-hours. Popular items include tall, blond Marie 
Antoinette-like wigs and small multicolored attachments to clip onto the hair 
and top with a hat. Part-timers can also get a cut that will cover shaved 
sections, as well as tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to have a professional look in the day, but when they're out 
clubbing, anything goes," Hofmann says. 
</P>
<P>
 Atila, a stylist at Royal Hair Design, is known for creating some wild dos, 
including his own mohawks. The 43-year-old stylist -- whose current coif is 
short, spiky and bleached white -- says the signature style of punk hair had 
faded from the scene until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazingly the same," he says of the look. "What's different is that the 
younger kids, 12 and 13 years old, who haven't even heard of punk bands, are 
doing it. Before it was a completely rock 'n' roll, musicians' haircut. Now it 
has nothing to do with music. Kids love it because it keeps them cool." 
</P>
<P>
 But not without some effort. To maintain a clean-looking mohawk, wearers must 
shave the sides of the head weekly, sometimes daily. And persuading a long 
mohawk to stand up straight is no easy matter; spiking tools include tons of 
hair spray and a megawatt blow-dryer. Egg whites, gelatin or Aqua Net Extra 
Super Hold -- noted for its staying power -- are old standbys. 
</P>
<P>
 Many neo-punkers do their own color, sometimes with help from friends. They 
bleach the hair using an over-the-counter product such as Wellalite Speed 
Bleach, then apply color by Manic Panic, Color Vivre or Crazy Color that will 
create peacock locks in about two hours. The colors -- in such shades as alpine 
green, eggplant and aubergine -- fade with each wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Ard of Bellflower redyes her brilliant-green hair once a month. She has 
cut down on the spiking, though, since emptying a can of Super Hold onto her 
hair, pointing it toward the sky and watching it snap in half. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Gray, 19, of Torrance, coaxes his fire-engine red mohawk into spikes 
when he gets the urge. He uses Paul Mitchell hair spray and redyes about every 
month: "I like the way it looks, and I like what it represents -- it's 
different."

THE BOTTOM LINE; MANY MEN STILL COTTON TO PJS, BUT SANS THE TOPS. (THESE ARE 
NOT THEIR FATHERS' PAJAMAS.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LAFAVRE YORKS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ricky Ricardo and Rob Petrie never went topless. And Frasier Crane always 
keeps his shirt on, too. 
</P>
<P>
 But real men don't always do jammies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sleep in the buff -- or in briefs, boxer shorts, sweats, even 
nightshirts. Of those who do wear PJs, many either sub out the matching top for 
a T-shirt or go bare. But whatever their bedtime get-ups, men -- and the women 
who shop for them -- have been snapping up pajamas lately, particularly the 
bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still some traditional men who wear the whole pajama set, but the 
biggest growth is in separates," says Sally Koellner, a Dallas-based buyer of 
men's sleepwear for JC Penney. While sales of sets are up 25% over the last 
year, she says, sales of separates have jumped 35% -- even though they're more 
costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Tops sell for $20 to $25, pants for about $20 and pajama shorts -- a plush 
take on boxers -- for about $15. Comparable PJs sold in sets go for about $30. 
</P>
<P>
 The separates are appealing because they look nothing like the piping-trimmed 
tops and flimsy bottoms often associated with traditional pajamas. They lean 
more toward casual wear, with baggy cuts, sturdy fabrics and drawstring 
waistbands. 
</P>
<P>
 Koellner says her husband isn't shy about leaving the house to do an errand in 
his bottoms and a T-shirt. "When he comes home from work, he puts them on and 
doesn't take them off until he goes to work the next day. He can even go into 
7-Eleven to pick something up if he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 "Men really do tend more toward just wearing the bottoms," says David 
Laliberte, public-relations associate for the Fashion Assn., a New York 
City-based apparel-industry organization. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Crew, with a mail-order business and 28 stores nationwide, is another of 
the growing number of retailers that sell pajamas as separates. The company 
offers PJ pants in bold plaid flannel for about $25, among other styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier resident Mark Haner prefers similar flannel styles from L.L. Bean. 
For a new father, he says, they're a necessity for midnight runs to the crib. 
"It's not like you can ask him to wait a minute while you get dressed," Haner 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 But some men can't bear to wear anything but traditional PJs. Will Utay of 
West Hollywood has been known to pack his for a camping trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came out of my tent in my maroon Jacquard stripe pajamas, people were 
in hysterics," recalls the actor, who plans to take a more outdoorsy-looking 
flannel pair on his next outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up wearing pajamas, I remember a sense of comfort and security. It's 
difficult for me to sleep if I am not wearing them," he says.

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: ARE WE NOT BABES IN SHOES? 
</P>

<P>
 There once was a woman in MaWho dressed her young darling in fine prints and 
cotton / When all of a sudden / It flashed in her head / To dress like her 
modish toddler instead .  
</P>
<P>
 The ad copy for a pair of $235 adult baby shoes by Peter Fox might sound 
nauseating to some ears. But we have a weakness for girlish shoes with flat 
rubber soles and wide toes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good thing. Patent leather Mary Janes, T-straps, saddle shoes and 
pared-down oxfords are rampant in designers' collections this spring. And while 
Westside matrons have long understood the singular allure of white Keds and 
anklets, this season's immature footwear -- paired with this season's 
thigh-grazing baby-doll dresses -- is considerably more provocative.

 Think knee socks and lollipop-licking.

 "I would imagine Freud would have a good time with this," New York shoe 
designer Kenneth Cole said with a laugh. His spring collection features at 
least two versions of Mary Janes. "Maybe there's this subliminal side in all us 
that wants to re-experience that time of naive innocence."  
</P>
<P>
 Then again, maybe it's not so subliminal. The Storybook Heirlooms catalogue 
offers at least a dozen pairs of its toddler party shoes -- in adult sizes. 
"Teardrop cutout shoes with feminine bows" go all the way up to size 10. I feel 
pretty, oh so pretty . . . .

 Just Say Yes: In recent years, the fashion world has channeled much of its 
fund-raising muscle in the direction of AIDS charities. On Feb. 22, though, 
Richard Tyler (Anne Klein), Anna Wintour (Vogue) and Neiman Marcus will host a 
$100-a-ticket party at Culver City's Smash Box photo studio to raise money for 
D.A.R.E. -- Drug Abuse Resistance Education. Driving the message home will be a 
short film directed by actor Johnny Depp. (It was Depp's Viper club, you'll 
recall, where actor River Phoenix collapsed and died of a drug overdose.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The point of the film," says Elizabeth Saltzman, Vogue contributing editor 
and the film's producer, "is that you have a choice in life. Don't choose 
drugs." The point of the event, besides raising money for a good cause, of 
course, is to continue to align Anne Klein with the youthful spirit Richard 
Tyler has brought the company in spades since signing on last year. For 
tickets, call (213) 965-3651.

 Fit to Be Tied: June Cleaver's aprons were about as interesting as a quilted 
toaster cover. But when Annie Potts' character in the CBS sitcom "Love and War" 
puts one on, it looks downright sexy. "I start with the apron and build an 
outfit around it," explains Emmy Award-winning costume designer Bill Hargate. 
"It's kind of demented but it seems to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Elvis, cowboys, poppies and kitchen utensils decorate a few of the 50 aprons 
in Potts' apron wardrobe, which Hargate buys around town at Mayfair market, 
Repeat Performance and Cooks Library. To turn up the heat in your kitchen, the 
designer suggests wearing an apron over dark leggings and -- if it has a top -- 
wear it as you would a T-shirt or blouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of like the apron underneath a coat or sweater, it's a little sexier," 
Hargate says. OK, as long as we don't have to cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty Lashes: Paula Pennypacker calls herself the Queen of Mascara. The 
Toledo, Ohio, woman -- a fair-skinned redhead -- has tried every shade of soft 
brown (and blue) mascara she could get her hands on for the last 20 years. "To 
go through life with black eyelashes and red eyebrows is god-awful," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 So Pennypacker came up with her own brand, which she sells through the mail 
for $9.50 a tube. The trick was finding a formula that didn't turn dark as it 
dried. Now she has. "This stuff would have done wonders for my self-esteem when 
I was a teen-ager," Pennypacker says with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 For a woman who spent her formative years eyelashless, Pennypacker seems to 
have done quite well. She was a mayoral candidate last year and is a political 
commentator at her local television station. For information, call (800) 
831-8240.

 And the Next Plane to Paris Is . . . ?: The much-heralded satellite broadcast 
of the Paris couture shows scheduled this weekend at UCLA's Royce Hall was 
canceled Wednesday. "The biggest problem was that nobody out here even knew 
about the shows," said Marilyn Jenet, hired by Paris Fashion Showcase to find 
an L.A. site for the shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The other problem was the price. Tickets for the shows were hundreds of 
dollars each. And at that price, viewers would not have seen the shows of the 
top houses -- Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Cardin. Organizers say 
they'll try the idea again in July.

A 'MALL' WHERE GEN XERS FEEL RIGHT AT HOME

 Picture this: stripped, wrought-iron patio furniture draped with tapestry 
fabrics and arranged over a worn Oriental rug, not indoors but alfresco. 
Castoff junk, such as a yard-long ceramic fish, carefully exhibited as art. A 
few feet away, free-standing pillars supporting a gilded Madonna statuette and 
a vase of fresh flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people come to this former factory and warehouse to hang out or peruse 
the alternative publications. They listen to the jazz, blues or 
alternative-music ensembles that perform next to the Gallery, where local 
designers show their wares. Soon, they will be able to screen music videos and 
watch foreign and art films. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, these visitors also come to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Lab, a 40,000-square-foot experiment in retail, custom-tailored 
for the '90s and targeted at that most discussed group of the decade, 
Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchoring the new center are Urban Outfitters, a chain that merges comfort 
with cool; Na Na, the terminally hip retail end of a company built on a Dr. 
Marten distributorship, and Tower Records Alternative, devoted to new music as 
long as it's not classical. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lab is embraced as a one-stop shopping source by youths who eschew 
mainstream dress, music and lifestyles. They may have previously zigzagged to 
boutiques selling unconventional and pre-trendy fashions or traveled Los 
Angeles' La Brea Avenue or Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, which 
features Urban Outfitters and Na Na. The Lab's founder, Shaheen Sadeghi, says 
it's designed to be everything a traditional mall is not.  
</P>
<P>
 "Malls are homes to corporate America; they're very much homogenized," says 
Sadeghi, who dubbed his center, in the shadow of mecca mall South Coast Plaza, 
an "anti-mall." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our approach to our customer is apropos to the times. We don't try to 
dazzle," Sadeghi says. "Malls don't like people to hang out. We do. The mall 
works with national brands; we don't, necessarily. I don't want to bum the 
malls out, but anybody that's young and hip doesn't want to go to a mall. Once 
you do, you lose your cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadeghi, 39, is familiar with youth culture: Before beginning the project 14 
months ago, he served a year as president of surfwear giant Quiksilver, 
preceded by five years as executive vice president at Gotcha. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is that this is not a perfect world," he says. "People like 
(the Lab) because it's not perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 The former factory has been gutted, carved, acid-washed and transformed into 
post-apocalyptic remains that house 15 store spaces, ranging from Urban 
Outfitters' 12,000 square feet to the Collector's Library, a crammed comic-book 
source, at 256 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Beams and pipes are exposed inside and outside stores, as are the structural 
metal tubes that once ran through a concrete wall. A few solid chunks remain as 
a reminder. Much of the wood and metal scraps that cover the walls were found 
in salvage yards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The use of these "poor elements" fits the recycling mode often advocated by 
the Lab's target market, says Lab architect Ron Pompeii of New York-based 
Pompeii A.D. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than create a synthetic bubble where everyone is pulled in and 
air-conditioned and treated to Muzak, we cut into an existing structure, 
revealing what's there instead of covering it with some other kind of 
material," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the anti-mall theme, Sadeghi invited retailers, such as Na Na, that 
avoid malls. "This is the only one that's in any kind of 'mall,' " says Na Na 
co-owner Lynn Tyler, "and this isn't a traditional mall, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the Lab considered a bazaar-like environ where up-and-coming local 
designers could set up shop, much like London's Hyper Hyper, which supports new 
English designers. That, however, was nixed, Sadeghi says, because "you just 
can't shove 50 new people without prior retail experience into a space." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he cites Urban Outfitters as an outlet for fledgling labels. Already, 
home-grown companies such as Split, Soul, 26 Red, Spot Girl, Fusion and Sjobeck 
hang alongside the Philadelphia-based company's own lines -- Urban Outfitters, 
Free People, Co-operative and Renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 And some local designers have settled into homes of their own at the Lab. 
Newport Beach's Modern Amusement will sell its hip, retro-style kids' clothes 
when it opens in a log-cabin-designed store Feb. 1. In the spirit of recycling, 
much of the store is being constructed with discarded wood; the counter is 
being made from pieces from the old Laguna Beach boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewelry designer Spencer Brown sought to avoid "the general public" by opening 
his Spencer Collection/the Bead Co. at the Lab. The Belmont Shore artist sells 
some of his 600-piece line as well as thousands of beads of glass, shells, 
ceramic, semiprecious stones and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyper Hyper's spirit has not been completely abandoned by the Gallery, a 
consignment showcase that will rotate local designers' wares monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 The courtyard's weathered furniture is for sale by Bungalow, which has a 
conventional sister store in Laguna Beach. And, not to be left out, there is a 
Lab store that sells signature Ts, pullovers, hats and other basics dyed in 
muted colors. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's not enough for the young bohemians, among the businesses set to open 
soon are Taxi Taxi, a vintage clothing store, a hair salon and two restaurants, 
in addition to a coffeehouse named the Gypsy Den. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to mix together all the things important to this generation," 
Sadeghi says. "But this is about more than shopping. It's quite the opposite of 
a strip center; you don't pop in and leave. It is a place where culture can be 
nourished." 
</P>

SCREEN STYLE / BETTY GOODWIN: UNADORNED ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Series: "Ricki Lake," airing 5 p.m. weekdays on KCOP, Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Former fringe film actress Ricki Lake (pictured) dropped about half 
her body weight and gained a daytime talk show. The youthful host stands among 
the audience as she shoots questions at a motley panel of guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: Input from her producers and focus groups. Lake's personal 
comfort zone dictates no high heels, ever, she swears. 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Expecting to see a punked-out teen queen with a pierced nose? Lake 
is hardly that, although she's sometimes shrouded in black from head to toe and 
occasionally stomps around in combat-style boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly svelte, having dropped from a Size 12/14 to an 8/10 in 25 weeks of 
taping, Lake dresses like almost any savvy young New York professional. She 
relies primarily on tailored separates -- in mostly dark solids -- with little 
dashes of costume jewelry. (She's big on hearts.) 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: Showing just enough attitude to satisfy her growing, youthful female 
audience, Lake also manages to make her daytime competitors look a little bit 
old hat. One recent afternoon, leather-clad Oprah Winfrey went for flash; Leeza 
Gibbons went for sexy in a tight, military-style suit, and Sally Jessy Raphael 
went for younger-than-springtime in a baby-pink suit. But Lake went for 
understatement in a black trouser suit, charcoal-gray turtleneck and silver 
ball earrings. Period. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss: Still evolving in the style department, Lake has had her fair share of 
setbacks. For one, she seemingly repeats a certain long black blazer -- or 
others that look just like it -- several times a week, as if she were posing 
for a women's magazine feature on a dozen ways to stretch a basic. Also, her 
jackets often fit too tight across the chest and too long in the cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemline Watch: From three to four inches above the knee to lower mid-calf. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "She's very unadorned and doesn't obsess with clothing," says 
co-executive producer Gail Steinberg. "I've never even seen her carry a purse. 
That's Ricki. She's just unadorned." 
</P>
<P>
 Excellent Hair Day: In a field where power hair is frequently power sprayed, 
Lake's shiny brown locks simply fall on her shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Labels include Episode and Zelda for separates and Agatha for costume 
jewelry.

BOOK REVIEW: FICTION; A WIDE-EYED VIEW OF AMERICA, WHERE ALL HAS BEEN MADE 
EASY; AN AMERICAN BRAT, BY BAPSI SIDHWA , MILKWEED EDITIONS $21.95, 328 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 1978 in Pakistan and 16-year-old Feroza Ginwalla, the heroine of this 
novel, is beginning to worry her relatively liberal, upper-middle-class Parsee 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 She won't answer the phone; she tells her mother to dress more conservatively; 
she sulks, she slams doors, she prefers the company of her old-fashioned 
grandmother; she seems to sympathize with fundamentalist religious thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do? "I think Feroza must get away," says Zareen, the girl's mother, to 
her husband, Cyrus. "Travel will broaden her outlook, get this puritanical 
rubbish out of her head." 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed it does -- although to a disastrous degree, from Zareen and Cyrus' 
point of view, for Feroza's three-month sabbatical with her uncle in 
Massachusetts turns into a three-year sojourn in many parts of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Zareen decides, toward the end of the book, to reassert parental 
control by flying from Lahore to Denver -- where Feroza has become a 
hotel-management student -- it's too late: Her daughter is already an "American 
brat," a woman with a mind and opinions of her own, able to relish the ability 
to choose. 
</P>
<P>
 "An American Brat" is an exceptional novel, one of such interest that the 
reader's reservations, while significant, are ultimately of little consequence. 
</P>
<P>
 Bapsi Sidhwa, author of three previous works of fiction and frequently 
referred to as Pakistan's most prominent English-language novelist, has 
produced a remarkable sketch of American society as seen and experienced by 
modern immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 America, to Feroza and her Uncle Manek, is in many ways a paradise -- as 
indeed it appears to be for Sidhwa, a Parsee who has lived in the United States 
for many years -- but "An American Brat" is nonetheless a measured portrait, 
often reassuring and discomfiting at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 It's both wonderful and startling, for example, to hear the fully Americanized 
Manek say to the newly arrived Feroza, as she grapples with some well-wrapped 
container, "Remember this: If you have to struggle to open something in 
America, you're doing it wrong. They've made everything easy. That's how a free 
economy works." 
</P>
<P>
 In style, "An American Brat" is nothing like Henry James' "The Ambassadors," 
being straightforward, humorous, easygoing and unpoetic. In plot, though, it 
bears some similarities, with travelers finding themselves unexpectedly 
transformed by their encounters in a new land. 
</P>
<P>
 Feroza soon realizes that Manek's years in the United States have changed him: 
He is now "humbler and, paradoxically, more assured and quietly conceited, more 
considerate, yet . . . tougher, even ruthless." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things Zareen notices about Feroza at the Denver airport is 
her gaudy tan: "You'd better bleach your face or something," she tells her 
daughter, "before you come home." 
</P>
<P>
 But even Zareen proves vulnerable to America's charms: 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has come to break up Feroza's engagement to a "non" -- a 
non-Parsee -- she glories in the shopping and amenities of Denver life, "as 
happy as a captive seal suddenly released into the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Zareen, her American mission at least partially accomplished, returns to 
Pakistan but wonders momentarily whether she has done the right thing. And 
that's the issue lying at the heart of this novel -- the competing loyalties 
immigrants feel toward family, culture, heritage, self. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem only flashes through Zareen's mind because she is too old to be 
fully taken with American ways; Manek can almost ignore the contradiction 
because, being male, he will be celebrated for living in the United States so 
long as he takes a Parsee wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Feroza, by contrast, feels the brunt of the conflict, newly aware of the 
severe sexism in Parsee culture -- men can marry outside the faith, for 
instance, while women cannot -- and thrilled at the idea of having her own 
money, her own career, her own identity. Feroza has come to America, she 
discovers moments after first landing in New York, to be "unself-conscious" -- 
to be free, once and for all, of "the thousand constraints that governed her 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 "An American Brat" suffers from a meandering, literal plot and a tone that 
doesn't distinguish major insights from minor ones. Page by page, though, 
Sidhwa keeps the reader engaged, for one can never predict which mundane 
American event she will display in an entirely new light. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital: A Parsee couple is presented with a $15,000 bill for their 
daughter's delivery, whereupon the shocked father replies, walking out, "You 
can keep the baby." At home: Feroza, gushing over Manek's vast supply of canned 
frankfurters and sardines, saying, "I could eat this all my life!" 
</P>
<P>
 At an expensive restaurant where Manek has sent back half his meal, to 
Feroza's horror, because he can't possibly pay for it: "If you weren't so 
proud," Manek tells his niece, "you wouldn't feel so humiliated, and you'd have 
enjoyed a wonderful dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 He has a point, however twisted, and it's moments like that which make "An 
American Brat" a funny and memorable novel.

CULTURE WATCH; DEFINING 'GANTELOPE,' 'ERNE': IT'S ALL IN THE GAME

 Before the spate of word games marketed at $20 to $40, there was a game 
requiring just pencils, paper and a dictionary. Created in the 1930s by French 
poet Andre Breton, this dictionary game has been passed along by students and 
others on limited budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be played by three people or a dozen, but about six works best. Each 
round, a player chooses a word that is read aloud and spelled. Players familiar 
with the word sit out the round on the honor system. (Yeah, right.) 
</P>
<P>
 Next, each player writes down a likely sounding definition on a small piece of 
paper. The bogus definitions are collected by the chooser. All definitions, 
including the correct one, are read aloud. Players try to decide which is 
legitimate. Scoring is negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
 The dictionary has obscure, archaic, scientific or professional terms, as well 
as many foreign words, including plenty of good old Latin. Flipping at random 
one might quickly find erne , trismus and gantelope . Creative souls may pick 
up a word like gantelope and run with it. In reality, it's an obsolete word 
meaning glove or gauntlet.  
</P>
<P>
 Most dictionaries include literary characters and allusions like "Old Man of 
the Sea." Sound familiar? But is it a poisonous jellyfish or a short novel by 
Ernest Hemingway? Neither; it's a character from "The Arabian Nights." STEVE

THEATER / JAN HERMAN; 'GREASE' FILM'S SONGS SLIP OUT OF STAGE VERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Notes from all over . . .  
</P>
<P>
 When the national touring version of "Grease" arrives in March at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, it will have an added song, "Since I Don't Have 
You," a 1959 doo-wop hit by the Skyliners that wasn't in the original Broadway 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the tune is especially appropriate, because "Grease" will be 
missing the three songs most widely associated with it: "You're the One That I 
Want," "Hopelessly Devoted to You" and the title song. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they were not in the 1972 Broadway original either, they were part of 
the popular movie -- and they were supposed to be inserted into the score of 
the touring revival, according to Fran Weissler, the New York producer who is 
financing it with her husband, Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 But London record executive Robert Stigwood -- who produced the 1978 film and 
owns the rights to those songs -- wouldn't allow their use after he and the 
Weisslers parted company over disagreements involving control and casting of 
the current tour, she said earlier this week in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we made the decision not to work with Robert, we knew we'd have to give 
up those songs," Weissler said. "For about a week we were devastated. We kept 
saying, 'My God, we need those songs.' But it turned out to be a blessing in 
disguise. It forced us to dig in and do something new and fresh with the show." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Grease" tour -- featuring Rosie O'Donnell, Ricky Paull Goldin and Susan 
Woods -- opened Thursday night in Wilmington, Del. It will move on to Boston, 
Washington and other cities before arriving in Costa Mesa. Then it will head to 
San Francisco and back to the East Coast for a Broadway opening sometime in 
May, Weissler said. 
</P>
<P>
 A nostalgic throwback to the '50s era of Elvis Presley and James Dean, the 
original "Grease" had its beginnings Off Broadway. When it transferred to 
Broadway, it became such a huge hit that it ran for nearly eight years without 
winning a single Tony Award. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the movie version starring John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John and 
Stockard Channing that turned the show into a national musical icon. The 
soundtrack went to the top of Billboard's pop-album chart and stayed at No. 1 
for a dozen weeks in 1978. It also yielded four Top 5 singles, including the 
three songs missing from the current revival. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're the One That I Want," a duet by Newton-John and Travolta, reached No. 
1 and breathed new life into Newton-John's recording career. "Grease," sung by 
Frankie Valli, also reached No. 1. And "Hopelessly Devoted to You," a 
Newton-John solo, went to No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Weissler and her husband -- who also produced the "Gypsy" and "My Fair Lady" 
revivals that came through the center on their pre-Broadway tours -- don't kid 
themselves about missing the "Grease" movie hits. They still would love to have 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike "My Fair Lady," which underwent major improvements (including song 
presentations) after leaving the center, this "Grease" revival won't be getting 
any fixes, Weissler said.  
</P>
<P>
 "What you see is what's going to Broadway," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD-BREAKER: The top-priced single ticket for the center's Broadway Series 
will hit a new high this year, thanks to "The Phantom of the Opera." The top 
ticket to the Andrew Lloyd Webber extravaganza, due at the center in July (with 
chandelier, but no name stars), will be a record-breaking $61.25. Ordinarily, 
$45 is the top.  
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers to this season's series (who get only a small discount) don't seem 
to mind, though. Their number has risen to 17,608 subscribers, according to a 
center spokesman. That's up from last season's 16,936.

 RED ALERT: Playwright Robert Daseler, a South Coast Repertory discovery who 
hasn't been heard from in several years, will have a new work, "The Red Room," 
read Jan. 24 on the SCR Mainstage in the Costa Mesa theater's NewSCRipt Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The title of the play refers to the color of the central figure's living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about a woman whose husband has left her," Daseler said. "She has 
acquired a house. After he leaves, she paints her living room. I guess it's a 
sort of statement." 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays by the Michigan-born playwright, who lives in Claremont, have been 
produced at SCR: "Dragon Lady" in 1989 and "Alekhine's Defense" in 1990. The 
new script is the first he has penned since then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't have the concentration for writing," said Daseler, 48, whose 
wife died three years ago. They met during their undergraduate days at Pomona 
College in the late '60s. Now he is raising their two young boys. 
</P>
<P>
 SCR describes "The Red Room" as a series of conversations (among the former 
wife, her daughter and the former husband's current live-in lover) that 
explores "the conundrums of women involved with contemporary men." 
</P>
<P>
 But Daseler doesn't think of himself as a theme writer. "I'm much more 
interest in character than either theme or plot," he said.

 BABY MILESTONE: Thursday night's world premiere of "Teachers' Lounge" at the 
Moulton Theatre in Laguna Beach was something of a milestone. John Twomey's 
comedy is the first new play produced by the Laguna Playhouse in almost four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent original work undertaken by the Playhouse was a huge 
production of "Manet," the Mark Turnbull musical that premiered at the Moulton 
in May, 1989. The Playhouse also did a workshop staging of another Turnbull 
musical, "Dora Hand," which had a summer run in 1985.

 BACK TO THE FUTURE: Theatergoers with long memories may have a sense of deja 
vu when "Evita" opens next month at Plummer Auditorium in a Fullerton Civic 
Light Opera production. FCLO producer Griff Duncan says he's bringing Julie 
Waldman in from New York for the title role. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldman, a Whittier native, played Evita nine years ago for FCLO. "She's 
really terrific," Duncan said when asked why he didn't cast someone who hadn't 
been seen before. "Last summer she was on tour with Michael Crawford, and 
before that she was on Broadway with Topol in 'Fiddler on the Roof.' "

 IT'S A DEAL: Beth Hansen and George Quick, last seen together in "Christmas 
With Sal and Amanda Gecko" at Saddleback College's Studio Theatre, are planning 
to bring a musical to the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've set a deal for the end of March," said Hansen, who also played a 
terrific Mrs. Lovett in "Sweeney Todd" last summer at Saddleback's McKinney 
Theatre in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Quick are uncertain about just what musical they will do at the Gem, 
however, and have yet to decide on a title. But then nothing ever seems certain 
when it comes to the Gem, at least not since the company that manages it, 
GroveShakespeare, collapsed in all but name last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Grove artistic director Kevin Cochrane, who has confirmed the deal with Hansen 
and Quick, said he, too, is planning to mount a play at the Gem. His offering 
should arrive in February, he said, but he hasn't decided on a title either.

BREAKING INTO PICTURES WITH WORDS; MOVIES: SCREENWRITING LECTURE WILL FEATURE 
THE FILM WORLD ACCORDING TO OSCAR-WINNER STEVE TESICH.

 Steve Tesich, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of such films as 
"Breaking Away" and "The World According to Garp," will speak tonight at 
Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 Tesich's lecture will begin at 8 p.m. in Chapman Auditorium and is expected to 
be both informational and anecdotal, said Mark Axelrod, a Chapman comparative 
literature professor who organized the program.Tesich will also present a 
briefer keynote address at the university's Winter Writer's Workshop, which 
runs Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Tesich, whose speech is part of his 10-day stint as the campus' 
screenwriter-in-residence, also is teaching an advanced screenwriting workshop 
for 14 students majoring in writing, radio or television. The daily classes end 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were chosen for the workshop based on screenplays they'd submitted. 
"All the samples were well done with much potential," said Axelrod, noting that 
many of the students "were speechless that they'd been picked. They're familiar 
with Tesich's reputation and know this is a great opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Axelrod added that Chapman felt it was a "coup" having Tesich head the 
workshop because of his reputation in Hollywood and in New York's theater 
community. Tesich has been honored for both his stage plays and his movie 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tesich was born in Yugoslavia and came to the United States when he was 13. He 
began his career as an off-Broadway playwright. Hollywood success came quickly 
with his first script. Tesich won the Oscar for "Breaking Away," a 1979 
coming-of-age movie featuring Dennis Christopher and Dennis Quaid. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Tesich went on to write "The World According to Garp" (1982), 
"Eyewitness" (1981), "Four Friends" (1981), "American Flyers" (1985) and 
"Eleni" (1985).

 Umberg vote -- A story Wednesday about legislative committee action on a child 
pornography bill mischaracterized the position of Assemblyman Tom Umberg 
(D-Garden Grove). Umberg abstained from voting last April because of 
ambiguities now resolved, spokesman George Urch said, and he now supports the 
bill -- including felony provisions.
